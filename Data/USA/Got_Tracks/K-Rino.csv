Grand Deception,Solitary Confinement,2003.0,"As we move forward
Any time you come closer to something
Your vision should get clearer
Am I right?

You are a tool and the Hidden Hand is using you
Please don't be delusional, the rulers of this world practice confusing you
The people and the priest and the imams 
have been jammed
By government scams
, 
mind systematically programmed
Blatant black hatred and racism
The way they laced the whole world and nation with traces of Satanism
This place is a pagan prison, the Founding Fathers' enslaving
Intentions were no different then Bush's and Reagan's visions
1776 they took action
This Illuminati
 
took form and was spawned from a Colombian faction
Just flip your one dollar bill over
And if you want me to expose the true code of deception, I will show ya
We live in a designed wicked system
The number 13 is consistent in Masonic symbolism
It represents transformation, 12 completes the cycle
So 13 is rebirth and regeneration
The meanings of this symbol are strategically hid
On the left side you see a 13 layer pyramid
Over that, sits the The All-Seeing Eye where the light shines
A sign of the Devil watching over you at all times
With the words ""Annuit coeptis""
13 letters meaning, ""He has favored our undertakings"", will you accept this?
Or will you learn the science and ignore 'em
Under the pyramid you see ""Novus ordo seclorum""
Translated: ""New Order of the World"" or ""the New World Order""
Authors and Satanic fathers of mass slaughter
The Eagle that you see on the right
Sits below 13 stars with a shield that has 13 stripes
And an olive branch in its claws with 13 leaves
Which is suppose to be in its talon to represent peace
But peace was always on a decrease
His other claw holds 13 arrows of war set to be released
And the letters at the bottom of the pyramid are fixed
With the Roman Numerals that equal 1776
The United States of America exists
In a deep devilish abyss with truth and paganism mixed
Every President that ever lived was foul
They gather at Bohemian Grove where they bow down before the Owl
See the Owl is wise and sees through the darkest of night
And there's a small one on the dollar near the one on the top right
It ain't hard to understand this government was never for us
The eagle was based off the Egyptian hawk Horus
The 13 colonies grew into wicked sovereignty
And made no apology for the obvious idolatry
Subconsciously we follow the ways of the Beast
And pay homage to pagan gods when we say the days of the week
Like Sunday, they worship the Sun; Monday, is Moon's Day
Týr the god of war was worshipped on Tuesday
Odin the Chief God is who Wednesday is named for
Thursday is Thor's Day, god of thunder, the mighty Thor
Friday was named after Frigga notice the pattern
Saturday is the Roman god of agriculture Saturn
Frigga was the goddess of love, the wife of Odin
The polytheistic theology needed decoding
The rituals like trips across the sand this man takes
The skull and bones fraternity, the secret handshakes
But understand he receives only 33 degrees
He secretly believes in Lucifer and other deities
Many powerful and rich people are controlled by these
They even hold the soul of several of your favorite emcees
Politicians telling lies, tongues whittled with thorns
And use hand gestures shaped in the form of Devil horns
You don't feel the city home cos you don't know what it entails
Satan tampers with stem cells and sprays chemtrails
The so called holidays are hypocrisy
Established to use religious doctrines to commit annual robbery
Christmas split in half is Christ Mass
The so-called birth of Jesus where every home has glowing lights cast
Christ the anointed One, Mass the birth celebration
But Jesus' birth was kept secret due to the situation
The King initiated a death plot
Cause a Messiah was prophesied to rule so Jesus' murder was authorized
No one knows the actual date, that's why sometimes you see 'Xmas'
X means unknown but ignorance affects us
A fraud that was purposely flawed
December 25th's is the birthday of the wicked ruler Nimrod
This whole disguise is part of Satan's universal wise
A Holy Prophet's life being pimped and commercialized
Traditions like lights on trees
Rooted in the Nicaea Council in 325 AD by Constantine
These matters would decreed
The concept of a virgin birth was actually conceived and then agreed
With graven images in the temple
The fish on your car is called Oannes, a Babylonian symbol
It's visibly contradictory, telling your children lies
You need to make them study Santa Clause's sick history
But yet we go wherever Satan leads us
The falsehoods we practice in his name ain't got nothing to do with Jesus",https://genius.com/K-rino-grand-deception-lyrics
Fuck Eminem,UnKnown,2012.0,"To y'all that don't know, it's ya boy K-Rino
There's a lot of stuff going on with Eminem
He made a song dissing a black woman
, so uhh
You know your boy ain't going to like that
To all these sell out MCs out here that's letting him make it
Y'all on the list too
This is how I'm a do this, boy
It go like this

You ain't no M&M bitch, ain't shit chocolate about ya
Everybody in the ghetto that owned a pistol should've shot ya
You disrespected the black woman and thought that you would pass
We gonna let every black queen out there take turns kicking you in the ass
String the bastard up and drag him like the mass savages
That captured Africans in the past and let the dogs have him
What do Shady mean? See I am a quick thinker
I think the letters mean Sorry Ho-Ass Dick Yanka
Understand, you done violated, look at your skin
This the Rap Game, our shit ho, we let your ass in
Your style is gay trying to come off like you deep in the head
You undercover like a motherfucker sleeping in bed
Hopped in the game and made riches, now it's time for stitches
""A black girl broke my heart"", that's what they do to punk bitches
""It happened a long time ago""
, Oh so now it's all gravy?
I wouldn't give a motherfuck if you wrote it when you was a baby
You still shit, fuck you and them sell-outs you chill with
We should've murdered your kick ass for dissing Will Smith
Leave this fool seeing double
, his mouth got him in trouble
I bet you and Vanilla Ice will make a pretty ass couple
 x2
I kick strong shit on motherfuckers I don't get along with
Testing K, you fucking wit the wrong clique
And I don't give a damn if your song hit, trick
I'm a still click, bitch

I'm a vernacular severer, dialect exhibitor
Pain distributor, carnivorous rhyme style deliverer
Oh you wish that you was black?, so I'ma help you my brother
When I finish smoking your ass you're going to be Wesley Snipe's colour
You diss your own mama, that's messed up, man
But I bet that you can't talk about her worse than I can
You think the black woman got raped and ran over for four centuries
To get dissed by an Aryan bitch with gay tendencies?
Kill that, I'm dropping a toxic lyric that's popping ya
And boxing your forehead until my knuckles engrave a swastika
And we done let this damn devil exploit
I vote for pistol whipping his ho ass from here to Detroit
Trying to jock 'Pac? That's what, your mind has gone
If Pac was alive, you'd probably be one of the main hoes he'd be riding on
I put tricks like you inside a wood coffin
Leave you absorbing words that make you regurgitate organs
You ain't no battler, bitch, you prey on the weak
I hit you with a diesel, let me see you stay on your feet
I mean, I've been controlling the underground rap zone
While you was at home with your wife getting fucked with a strap on

I kick strong shit, on motherfuckers I don't get along with
Testing K, you fucking wit the wrong clique
And I don't give a damn if your song hit, trick
I'ma still click, bitch",https://genius.com/K-rino-fuck-eminem-lyrics
Hidden Agenda,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"You don't see it but it's right there in front of you (x3)

They wanna depopulate the civilians
Nowadays they say it's easier to kill than to try to control millions
National debt sits in the trillions
And there's a plot to steal the birthright of the children of Israel, the real ones
Plans to hide every revolutionary's relevance
Triggered by the FBI's counter intelligence
Leaders killed and jailed unjustly by its director
The aggressor J. Edgar Hoover, the racist cross dresser
His orchestration of hatred laced investigations
The infiltration of civil rights organizations
Assassination to character, defamations through media
Even today used in deceiving and misleading ya
Believe in the war motivated lies they feeding ya
Corporate American thieves get greedier and greedier
Neo-cons hate the poor, they spent years denouncing 'em
The poor built this country but nobody's looking out for them

You don't see it but it's right there in front of you
(Left side, right side, over you and under you)
You don't see it but it's right there in front of you
(Right side, left side, over you and under you)
You don't see it but it's right there in front of you
(Left side, right side, over you and under you)
You don't see it but it's right there in front of you
(Right side, left side, over behind and under you)

Propaganda and TV nonsense keep people unconscious
Pompous governments keep sponsoring bomb hits
Honesty is far gone, the land is a war zone
Your family and your children consuming animal hormones
Nothing is organic, nearly everything real is gone
Fast food places selling great meat with silicone
Everyday we pay for it, now the whole nation's sick
Addictive and money driven drugs are what the patients get
Any natural remedy the FDA sanctions it
'Cause they don't want the cure, they want the money that they make from it
The USA's a corporation, wealth is the emphasis
Prison industrial complexes, slave businesses
Stock market interested, the reason that they build them
In advance is cause they know eventually they're gonna fill 'em
Orchestrated the system to incarcerate your children
And project future inmates based on that to make millions


The truth was never taught by the enemy and it won't be
The real power is always the entity you don't see
Subconsciously planted in your head is where he wants to be
Thousands of media powers owned by three companies
85 percent of the whole planet in darkness
Spend millions on sports teams while the homeless are starving
Nobody wants to protest, rally or picket
But there's a line around the corner for them concert tickets
Soldiers dying everyday, you keep sending them out
I wanna send 5000 killers to Zimmerman's house
The Rockefeller's and the Bush family in the same box G
Henry Ford all of them supported the Nazis
Members of the Tea Party still telling black jokes
You wearing the clothes but the designer hates black folks
Reporters wanna get dirt, sound bites and excerpts
CNN must mean Corrupt News Network
Lost every dime you had riding with the wrong stock
Made in USA is dead, China got it on lock
Lost your 401k and all the paper you was holding
Cause you invested in something somebody else was controlling
They make it go up and down, rise high or fall deep
The markets manipulated by people on Wall Street
Talk about the Middle East like America's errorless
University campus and movie theater terrorists
True devilish temperament, the government is infamous
Ask 'em what they do to Guantanamo Bay prisoners
They dominate the airwaves and lie to the listeners
Presenting false information intended to condition us
The black man's thinking since slavery is the evidence
Most don't understand what the Willie Lynch Letter meant
Centuries of self hate in divisions of blacks
Now they twist the difference between racism and facts
We read the Declaration of Independence with blinders
There were 9 Freemasons amongst the 56 signers
In 1870 along came the Shriners
A higher order of masonry with a secret behind them
The sword on the logo, it speaks for itself
Meaning anyone who tells the secret is put to death
Who is Hiram Abiff? What's his true identity?
The Devil's agenda be to kill us mentally continually
The wolf in sheep's clothing who fabricated divinity
The enemy who murders through lies, science and chemistry
Trickery and industry for power they forever plot
You went to war to fight for a freedom that you never got
Dirty chess moves executed by the Hidden Hand
Now they're plotting on a way to go to war with Iran
Same game used again, same wicked methods born
Just like Paul Wolfowitz had done before Desert Storm
The government is broke, they can't cater to your needs
Planned Parenthood persuading to kill your future seeds
The school system misleads, they money hungry savage vultures
If you chase degrees you better get you one in agriculture
Now it's questions in the music are you in the other mix
Why the hell you covering your eyes and throwing up the 6
Did you give your soul away, a price that you cannot afford
Did you take from Satan what you could've got from the Lord
God is DNA, baffling it might seem
His existence is rooted in the number 19
His origin comes from where the mathematics say he's from
D the fourth letter, N is fourteen and A is one
Who will prevail in the end, the divine or the evil?
This war that's going on is for the minds of the people
Calamities keep increasing world confusion bound to deepen
Nobody can take control of their surroundings if they're sleeping",https://genius.com/K-rino-hidden-agenda-lyrics
The Game Goes On,Family Bizness (Mixtape),2004,"Grab me some chips or something, man

I'm living paycheck to paycheck, tryna pay the rent
Crackers thinking I'm a slave forever, they got me bent
I'm bout to pull a move, 'bout to rob one of 'em blind
Let me call my partner Z-Ro and see what's on his mind
Well, I'm going through a thang, K, I really need to make some change, K
I'm thinkin' 2-11, I'm feelin' strange, K
No job, there's no way for me to pay the bills
If you with me then let's get paid, live lavish and chill
You ain't sayin' nothing homie, I been waitin' for a lick
Got a gal fine as hell, but I'm too broke to trick
The last two months I've been thinking of a caper
Come scoop your boy up and let's connive on some paper
Get in, put on your seatbelt so the Laws won't hate
We takin' a trip to the bottoms with Mr. Hector bakes cakes
$9,000 for a half, $18,000 for a whole
But I ain't bring no money with me, just my black .44

The game goes on
And it might not ever change
Too familiar with this pain
Is it suicide living in the fast lane?

Boy, this plan kind of real, Ro, I'm ready to ride
But what's the deal with all these hard heads standing outside?
This boy he got an army and they all heat packers
Two guns against twenty equals two dead jackers
I know the odds are against us, therefore I planned ahead
In the trunk is an AK, HK, AR, in the back of the car
Plus, it ain't no rush, we gon' lay low
'Til his partners start to leaving and he's drunk on the floor
Yo, you know I heard that he a sucker for a screwing
Let's set this fool up with Michelle and let her do him
Get his guard down then right before he rise
We kick the door in and unleash heat, surprise
But it ain't his birthday, it's gon' be his worst day
K-Rino and Z-Ro, we both currency thirsty
Hit my phone, call Michelle so we can get it together
Man, I'm tired of being broke bro, let's get this cheddar

The game goes on
And it might not ever change
Too familiar with this pain
Is it suicide living in the fast lane?

You know what, Z-Ro, this move that we pulled was sheist
But I ain't never seen this kind of paper in my whole life
Money all around me, can't get much greater
Just stuff it in the bag, man, we'll count it up later
Yes, indeedy, guess you can say the needy got greedy
But I was tired of hearing my children scream, ""Daddy, please feed me!""
I got up, got out and got something fast
But I'm feeling funny 'bout the way we got this cash
Man, don't sweat that, you 'bout to have the finer things
'Cause we got more money than Timmy Chan got wings
Diamond rings and fancy things and pockets full of change
'Cause the game goes on and it ain't gon' never change

The game goes on
And it might not ever change
Too familiar with this pain
Is it suicide living in the fast lane?",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-game-goes-on-lyrics
Journey Thru the Metaphor Labyrinth,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"I morph into an arrow from a crossbow, forgo your torso
And throw myself at the compartment where your thoughts grow
Cardio blows kill your heart slow
Composed decades of raw flow but lost no skill over the cost though
My tongue got four blades like a Quattro
When it sparks in war mode, it offs foes like a dog swollen from parvo
I barked so hard my own jaw broke
I host a talk show and narcissistic marks get roasted in the dark smoke
My speech shocks like a hot grease pot
The least drops secretes enough heat to leave potholes in the street top
A hundred years later the heat stops
To properly clean up what leaks out you need a thousand square feet mop
Now I’m smoking brains over open flame steam
And I’m throwing pain beams that make novocaine scream
I’m lynching them with the throw speed of Lincecum
And in the interim, no-ones even allowed to think, vision or mention him
When I don’t have a mic device to flow on
My spawned robotic protons let me to remove my whole arm like Voltron
Then hard as granite my hand gets, my fist becomes expansive
I speak through it and rapid vocals transmit
The marvel syntax gambit, I ran it
When the ethereal telephone is ringing I span planets to answer it
As soon as you make a mad try to be a bad guy
I’ma pass by, snatch and hide you inside of a flash drive
Known to speak fast as gazelle feet
While you release words that excrete the kind of discharge a snail leaks
Rain, hail, sleet, I scale beats and reach rocket propelled peaks
You can’t see me but feel me like Braille sheets
Moving with the force of a whale fleet, I swell cheeks for twelve weeks
My tongue punctures lungs deeper than nail cleats
Over elite teachers I prevail sweet, completely delete
And keep you between the border where Heaven and Hell meet
Methods extend far beyond the weapons of men
The heat pressure of my rap sheets registers measure of ten
Hidden messages within my word lessons again
Skill kills any time you put the ‘S’ at the end
Nonetheless I’m the professor who invented the test
My consciousness got much compressed into a minute or less
Happy to say that you’re a ""Cast Away"" captive of K
Kidnapped tomorrow so you’re eternally trapped in today
And time flies so I mixed and made it hard to surmise
So an hour from now won’t even be there when you arrive
I misdirect seconds with chronologic evil effects
You have to rewind the time to find week after next
Notice the threats that I exploded like loaded tecs
Holes in his solar plex’, his stomach turns like a Roll-O-Decks
And then my throat injects a mainstream artist with spoken gangrene
That’s so supreme it left a growth on him long as a planes wing
Your back is dropped over the top of some jagged rocks, these
Average flocks watch me like Magnavox as I shatter blocks and ravage spots
The arrowbot whose so past the top I piss on astronauts
With massive shots, I’m like two surgeons, I’m a paradox
The more rotten rappers plot, the worse my habit got
And oxygen is no longer an option when the cabin locks
I stare at dots till my hair is hot, one of my savage plots
Will have knots soft as a fabric washed bag of socks
I rock a beat till the cops retreat, known to block the street
And drop some heat even with taser guns shocking me
I’m obviously elite you can not compete
Jotted my topics deep into the night, when I finish writing the clock will sleep
My jabs raps are great, they decapitate
What used to be a rapper’s face is now only a neck under a massive space
I’m half erased basket case
Once my styles gas your place, they leave a 98 day after taste
I multiply bars for more rhymes
See when I design them I write every line differently four times
My intellectual home is a terror zone
My baritone is known to circulate strong psychedelic pheromones
I shoot free throws with globes and bowl strikes with frontal lobes
Compose and make a hundred robed scholars look like one year olds
Stunning flows, I hold a tonne of those, right-handed atomic blows
Medics don’t know how to keep holes in his stomach closed
To grasp my ideas take five years
My senses work in reciprocities so my ears see and my eyes hear
So twisted that even love hated me, I insatiably ate for weeks
I’m so crazy that bravery’s afraid of me
Barricade yourself in the back of your house
And I’ll be reaching through keyholes and snatching you out
My multiple styles left him so toxified his throat fried
The planet's diameter, I was standing on both sides
No surprise that I go harder than most guys
And flow until he’s lifeless and won’t stop until his ghost dies
The super speed letter monster
I’m reading aloud fifty thousand words a minute on the teleprompter
Dominate and skill preponderant, once the Sun was lit
I lunged a tonne of spit and encompassed it for the fun of it
That’s nonsense, not an honest accomplishment
The velocity I’m coming with is so prominent the speedometer vomited
Never seeking the glamour, I get deep in the grammar
Slam my words into your face like the teeth of a hammer
And regardless if your claws are cleaner, my internal bars are meaner
Scar you in a large arena somewhere out in Argentina
I walk a path between pacifist and acid fiend
Blast you with gasoline, film it and watch it on a plasma screen
My writing past supreme, flow tactics are baffling
He last was seen a mile from Abilene in a vast ravine
I watch these known cats recycle and clone raps
I architected hard digital dome slap phone apps
Slaughter every name on my rhyme list
Explosives in a dozen roses, guess you could say I killed them with kindness",https://genius.com/K-rino-journey-thru-the-metaphor-labyrinth-lyrics
Gotcha Name On A Bullet,Danger Zone,1995.0,"In the house, K-Rino chillin’ with eighteen of the hardest emcees
Ay, Dilemma ain’t here but she here in spirit
I’ma just leave so y’all do whatever y’all wanna do
I’m out, holla

Buck buck, we just pulled the motherfucking microphone
Your name was on a bullet, now it’s in your dome
That’s like mind-blown, so my thoughts turn deep
 interrupting my sleep
Oh shit, , they try to make me go crazy
But I can’t get caught slipping because these hoes got to fade me
, a ghetto  packing a Tec
If you step, I got to wreck, it’s all a fucking complex
I flex my hand in my Dickies, reaching for my gat
Pull the trigger to your dome, stop you dead in your tracks
Homicide, homicide, paranoid 
Death in my eyes, you wonder why I yell 

My penmanship contains high tech grammar
Gifted from birth so therefore I will land the
Rhyme like a jet down the runway, here I come
Time to launch and land, burst off and expaaaaansion
It’s fun when done right
Suckers need to learn how to write, don’t bite
Me, I’m talking to the light, not the black, still in fact
It’s the black crews that we crack
No rules, paid dues, like those skills, I’m still at it
Dope  holocaust, the musical scientist, rap addict
It really don’t matter when suckers start tripping
I put in the clip of my 9
My mouth be flapping and yapping just like I’m busting caps  ‘

I  half a brain covered with razor blades
But that ain’t shit, you bet your death when I came back and hit it
Mmmm, you got me me pissed off, why would you call my shit soft?
Snatched the mic so hard I ripped your motherfucking wrist off
I summon thunderstorms from the flow I’m feeling
Property damages, estimated at about twenty million a piece
The beast within release the sun
Rose in the west, but followed me traveling east
Metaphysical, me and my brain indivisible
 my body inside my soul so that makes me invisible
, I can take the punches, but hell it don’t hurt as bad as 

Section A forever, kicking that crazy shit
Real locs from the street, police couldn’t fade me, bitch
Down with the Ace man and the (*Rah!*) E-y-q-u-e
So if you bumping your gums, I have to do you, G
So look out, when K-rino pull them Black Book out
Wooh, now that’s a fire, fuck it, let’s throw a cookout
So what’s it gonna be, mesquite or hickory?
Put these nuts on sucker’s chin so you know where my dick’ll be
Nowhere to run, I got your name on a bullet
The beam is placed on your forehead so just relax when I pull it
DBX with the dope lyrics, come get a fix
But if you step  ‘cause you done stepped in some shit

Uhhhhh, so many ways to execute
Blindfold yourself, Ruff Eyque is about to shoot
You don’t wanna witness this mass murderer
The shit I shoot, the blast will hurt at ya
Eat your earplugs, gargle and hard hat
Time to put in some work, I never parted that
What’s his name? Mike, Joe or Fred
When you find him, paramedics gonna call him dead
Somebody please come and verify his remains
Whatever he experienced, he was terrified and deranged
Used to be the blood clot, Eyque go all out
Them bullets touch your ass, you go “ooh ooh hot, ooh ooh hot”

Here comes the Brain
Here comes the Brain
Here comes the Brain
Here comes the Brain
Neurotic, psychotic, brain dead, sagely insane, deranged
Step forward  strange in the mental
Asylum 
Listen close, you hear that soul screaming?
What lies within is unknown but the black holes is leaving
There’ll be no more that remains just a few corpses and carcasses
 eternal darkness
Like a spell they been cast last, thrashed with 
Mutilated, devastated, terminator’s annihilation’s completed
Into the realm of death, proceed with caution, the danger
You chose to step into my mind, into the torture chamber

This be me, the nigga Lee
Down with the group known as the SPC
Niggas didn’t know I was down with ‘em
Now I’ma clown with ‘em
So let me fuck around with ‘em and bust a fucking sound with ‘em
It’s time for me to pop joints and cop punks
And stop ones that throw my lyrics hard enough to drop punks
Weak shit, hella you’ll save that shit for the pigeons
Some say I can’t flow, well here’s a motherfucking smidgen
When I sit down, I get down with riff sound
Ah this sound is so crunk, that I aim to 
So who’s the nigga with the trigger so pull it
So buck ‘em, fuck ‘em, your name’s on a bullet

Psychotic son of a bitch, a motherfucker without a mind
Hey niggas will be dying as long as I got a 9
Zero, ya Kevin King, that be my nigga from the heart
Kevin King, you been my brother,  been down from the start
K-Rino, they don’t know who I am
Suspect from Pearl Homes, I never gave a damn
I put it like this, I like to fuck but not to be fucked with
Niggas be getting bucked, bitch, running up with that punk shit
Yo, so if you wanna fuck with me
You’ll be fucking with that SPC
Huh, and you don’t wanna step
I got your name on a bullet and that bullet equals death

I got your name on a bullet, bitch
I ain’t forgot that shit you said, nigga, you’s a snitch
See I chores it and life goes on
So feel good you wasn’t victim to my chrome
But don’t celebrate, my mind state ain’t settled
‘cause after  you might meet the devil
So that’s just a taste
In our heart, it ain’t shit for your punk ass life to waste
Blood coming out your pore
Fucking with me, you never know what’s in store
Dealing with me, the X-Man who’s known to check a bitch
1-87, fuck a snitch

Y’all fools, boy, ay, I got nine more to go though, so y’all don’t go nowhere, y’all sit and listen to this song

Grimm’s got you
Running but you got yourself off in this mess
The shots of an SKS
Get hot with ‘em in your flesh
But what were you thinking at first?
That you finna kick a verse?
I , that’ll make the matter worse ‘cause
What I wanna know is if you  the real deal
Looking like you couldn’t  when the brown boy got your grill peeled
Coming up with some of that weekend you can’t quit


Shoulda been no blunder , but instead your  dead pero



The big nigga, 285, 6’1’’
Grudges been made, while lot of grudges been broke by Murder One
,  weighs a ton
I’m sipping on , I’m knocking hoes out one by one
Ain’t no love, bitch, trust that, little trust
Therefore I’m  for the next nigga bust
A cap on a young brother, making him take a long nap
Laying on his back, miss his family, 
Perhaps Murder One the wrong man to look up to
Take care of your business, damn fool, and do what you gotta do
Now your name’s on a bullet
So step up, motherfucker, and watch a big nigga pull it

That motherfucker, Klondike Kat, gives birth to a verse
The fetus is from the elitist, no one will beat us
Some may even attempt to repeat us, but they’re just turkeys
Gobbling in the being of some blood thirsty cheetahs
Speaking of blood thirsty
Kick down your door, bust two in your bitch
And then demand what you’re worth key
MF be setting the roadblocks and obstacles
Can’t see my verbal attack from the blind side ‘cause I’m a 
The lighter shake and fitted for graves from the styles I made
One swing of my blade left  with a headless fade
John Doe’s engraved on every hollow point in the 4-4
Trigger-gram at your front door with your name on the bullet hole

Slash, crossed the ass of the hollow
‘cause Devil, I ain’t gon’ spend your , my name ain’t no Rallo
I’ma follow your punk ass to the death of this murder lead
So nigga please beware Tech-9’s coming like a death prayer
So you best be coming to even the score and kill me, bitch
‘cause when I can store a few tricks it’s on some shit to tongue-twist
Get fixed, hole that shit, feel you wanna click, just wait
‘cause you might just fuck around and slip out the hands of Allstate
The Tech-9, bitch, I’m long from a ranger, hoe
Step up, get teched up, I’m a gun-slinging Tonto so
10-4, get buddies, holla at your 
Tech-9, that nigga under siege, SPC

 lifer, the type of nigga that just don’t give a fuck
So if I gotta buck, I’m gotta buck ya with my 9mm
And you know I won’t miss
Two shots in your dome, fuck aiming for your 
It’s your boy Black, I ain’t no motherfucking punk so
Nigga, where your gun? I see you heading for your trunk
I’m steady hitting them backstreets to keep my paper stacked
Slanging big crack and hittin’ them 2-11 jacks, so
Have you ever heard of a killer
The aggravated fool plus that unknown cap-peeler?
Add the shit up ‘cause I’m ruthless in this game
And I’m up for parole, that’s why this bullet got your name, bitch

 son as I take you through the depths of hell
Adventure through the park where real niggas dwell
Take a look into a scope, I see you’re blurry
Take a  and then I focus
Many are chosen but only very few survive
You can’t see  and do not get 
Keep  and you’ll witness your own death
Or you become a statistic on one shelf
It’s that third point draft pick, the psycho fanatic
Hearing my voice on another dope track, shit
I’m constantly active, I will not be 

Niggas in my hood asking me to lick a shot
So I’ma pull the trigger ’til I see some bodies drop
Another bloody sucker added to the murder scene
Another empty clip from the Glock 19
I’m having thoughts of motherfucking homicidal action
Never leaving the house without my gat ‘cause I be jacking
You said you wanted folks so my niggas came with it
A multitude of shots left his wig all splitted
So now I’m on the run for a motherfucking murder
‘cause leaving the house without my gat is something that’s unheard of
I’m coming from the streets of H-o-u-s-t-o-n
Braking niggas in half as I blast with this MAC-10

Now I’m waking up in the morning thinking about the shit I’ma do today
Will I live to see another day? I grab my AK
And headed out the door, these bitches cannot trick the
Motherfucking thug with the 
Now I’m up the street, doing my thang, selling my ‘caine
I never wanted to  because I’m loyal to the game
Kicking the funky shit with my motherfucking niggas
You step on my Vans, you’re making me mad, I turn into a killa
Nothing but a murder murder, nigga, that’s what I said
Chrome into your dome and with the light that’s infrared
See I put you in the ground and 
And taking the people back to this earth 

It ain’t the way I walk or how I talk that’s bugging me
It ain’t the way that I be looking upon society
It’s just them little surviving, boastings talking in my head
Won’t come in equipped with brick, don’t slip in keeping my family fed
I never be giving a fuck, pumping your ass with this 9
But I make you understand a  ass man defended mine
My  usually pistol packing watching the blood spill
‘cause I need hot meals, and who gon’ pay my bills?
So what’chu gon’ do? It’s my weekly  when I been down too long
Insane in the membrane, grab my nuts and my mind is long gone
It’s , that nigga that never gave a fuck with this Glock and uh
I’m the one that’ll fuck you up in your talk so uh
You better be moving
When I’m coming equipped with the pistol grip and the uzi
Never be giving a fuck, if I got my Glock, then I’ma use it
Empty the clip, I’m creeping up, throwing my sign ‘cause I’m a Hoover
Heard you were flipping and dipping them squares, I’m fried about this doobie
I’ll be damned if I don’t get this nigga full with music
Bubble my quake and taking shit, his name is on my bullet

Bah bah bah!
SPC in the house forever, ah aaaa
All praises due to Allah

Duality,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"I was wondering
What would it be like if I had a rap partner
So I decided to separate myself, split my chromosome
And now there's two of me
What is the world gonna do with me?
Let me introduce y'all to my new rap group
C'mon
Tell me which one of us you like the best
Ha, Ha
Whoo (What's up, man?)
Let's Go

Magnetic reversal makes earthly roads flip
Out of control cold drifts across the whole planet once the poles shift
The prophecy explorer, as I read the Torah
I release an aura from the core of my mind that sparks a fluorescent Aurora
Well you can try this Columbian neck-tie on
My ideas fly on electrically charged metallic ions
When it comes to stopping this, you'll be optionless
I left Ominous documents inscripted on top of his sarcophagus
Yeah but even on the coldest polar days
I wear solar rays, on the bottom of my feet like roller blades
While in my fetal stage, I wrote a page
I can outrun heat from a loaded gauge in Methuselah like older age
I crack codes from intergalactic back roads
Sliding from the head to the souls of the deepest black hole on the bat pole
Tryna learn what I write might burn,
Like a microwave type perm, I split the term discerning hyper life germs
I'm writing scriptures from within that send Richters over ten
With a pen that allows me to draw pictures of the wind
I got photographic visualization
Instantaneous memorization of difficult chemical equations
When time existed at zero digits
People witnessed my acts of scientific pre-Neolithic geophysics
They bombed my temple from a couple miles past the Hubble
I came out of the stubble in a gaseous elastic bubble
Well I speak with unshakable certainty
At birth my first words left the Earth and landed on Mercury perfectly
When I come, I won't be seen exclusively
I'll be in a group of three, the man you see, the dude I used to be and the future me
In the winter I can make the summer come
A common bond with M. Night Shyamalan when it comes to paranormal mic phenomenon
I'll collar you, bite and swallow you
So physiologically knowledgeable that I could probably not move and follow you
To escape you'll have to navigate through space for instance
Eight solar systems away might be the safest distance
I dance in heavenly mansions and visually calculate how many times in a hour a fan spins
I appear in a coat of cashmere, I'm casting fear
Like when bats appear
For a half a year I practice cracking atmosphere
If you offer me a glass of beer
I'll shoot toxic gas in here, that will last until the Sun passes and the grass is clear
Why would you question my relevance?
I'm wearing titanium helmets to prevail against warlock spells and the elements
Move freely through the evolution of all species
Before radio frequencies and TVs throughout history you could see me
My thought growth exceeds the average trees
I'll travel past the seas at massive speeds and read faster than magic rabbits breed
Splitting you is not a tough decision
What I drop makes a collision that'll give a Cyclops double vision
But as soon as he's placed in his tomb
I rewind from his doom to his eulogy inside of the funeral room
To the moment right before his mortal flesh was consumed
Back to his final oxygen intake while facing the Moon
Through previous decades as he returns to the womb
Nine months in reverse back to the reproductive vacuum
Passing theologians by re-separating the sperm from the ovum
Making him return to the indulgence of your paternal hosting
It goes in the brain where I close in
Put a needle in his lobe, extract your unborn soul and leave it frozen
So much so the whole Earth is cold
My words are so advanced a 20 million years from now unwritten verse is old
I read a scroll get agitated impede a roll
And implodes your torso inside of a needle hole
My rap pops like straps chop MCs from the waist to their legs drop
You'll have to hand hold ya laptop
I'm knowing 8 wraths from my spacecraft
Then me and my great staff, begin to sail the universe's most unsafe paths
I take baths in radiation base draughts
My mindstate has a capacity so vast that I could recreate mass
Once a thought is born, nothing can harm it
You don't understand the magnitude of torment that it took for me to form it
I dare you to deal, each of labyrinth characters killed
Got a Captain America shield that I wear in the field
I move at a rate so great the time warp will fracture and break
I show up at a place so early I'm actually late
Or I can activate velocities no one can impede
At such a rapid pace I usually get back before I leave
My cranial lab is made from titanium slabs
Flaming paragraphs that travel intravenous paths
Vocal 30 AWG, place me in the worst spot
My words can split a rock in a church lot from 99 blocks on the first shot

(Woah, Yeah)
You know what?
(What's up?)
You pretty good
(You ain't so bad yourself)
Maybe we should go just head on and... stay as one
(*Both K-Rinos laugh*)
Or we can spread out
(Spread out?)
You take one side of the universe I take the other
(I don't know)
Nah, we ain't gonna do it like that",https://genius.com/K-rino-duality-lyrics
Valley of Decision,Time Traveler,2006.0,"I'm in a spiritual prison, but on this day I've arisen
To the vision of an internal god and Satan collision
The fight to win me took place within me
And whoever I submit it to would ultimately choose where they would send me
I stood motionless, approaching this comatose-ness with openness
Could only hope and wish for sanity when I awoke from this
I'm coping with the possibility of making the wrong choice
No reason to rejoice, I heard Satan speak in my own voice

You love me don't you?
Think of everything I meant to you
Since day one remember all the happiness I sent to you
The days that I provided ways for cash to pay the rent for you
The things you meant to do that he prevented you, I lent to you

He tempted you and you let worldly elements affect you
The things that I prevented you were done so to protect you
I expect you to make mistakes, but call I won't neglect you
Follow me and I'll eject secular ways and resurrect you

You know I'll follow you god, your power I done seen it

Yeah I hear your mouth but profess I don't really think you mean it
You been claiming religion but you seem to do what I say
If he got more to offer, then why you always leaning my way?

That's a good question, see god it's like you there but still I'm one deep
Sometimes the abstract is harder to take to than the concrete
So talk and faith is one thing, I want to feel you like a sun beam

But the key part of faith son is believing in the unseen

What do you mean?

Let me explain it K-Rino
Do you believe you have a brain?
(Yeah)
Have you ever seen it?
(No, oh)
Now do you understand?

Yeah it just hit me
Just because I can't see you that don't mean that you ain't wit' me

Let me jump between this nonsense, y'all analyze too much
What feels better things you visualize a thing that you can touch
You already know the business if you step into my zone
I'll award you all the lustful things he'll never condone

Haha, this reminds me of a Dolemite movie
If I make a deal with you then in the end you goin' do me
I'm caught between two forces trying to actively peruse me
Confused on who's truly loaded with the tools to rule me

I already rule you won't you just admit it (never!)
Think of all the things I gave you, all the fun we had together
(yeah we did have some good times)
So lets end this discussion

Wait a minute K think of all the pain a repercussions
All the problems that you caused people and when trouble got too hard
Who saved your life and fixed the situation?
(it was you lord!)
That's right son, so come with me I'll show you real wealth
You bowing down to an entity that's lower than yourself

Yeah that makes sense I'll follow you

You made the right choice, you won't regret this

Hold up god, what's the matter with your voice?

Oh, I'm just a little hoarse son from all this debating

God, hoarse, wait a minute I been tricked man this is Satan
You deceived me and brought me here to make me follow wrong

Yeah the voice you thought was God was really my voice all along

Well if that's the case I didn't know so God will still bless me
That means that God was speaking in your voice to try to test me
I guess at least I'm hoping that's the way it gotta be

Not necessarily actually K both voices were me (laughs)

Awww man I done accidentally condemned my own soul
Gave it up to evil knowing that ain't even how I roll
Yeah I sin, but I love God and that's who I submit to

I know son and that's why I came down here to get you

Hold up now, who is this? See now I'm getting confused

I'm the real God this was a test son you made it through

How I know this ain't another trick and what you say is true?

Once you claimed me Satan lost all power over you
But he was never here in this case I made it this hard

So you was God posing as Satan
Doing an imitation of God acting like Satan?
That's too deep, but I'm glad it's all over

It's never over cause the real devil is always on your shoulder
So remember every single trial that I put you through
If you was in the valley of decision, what would you do???",https://genius.com/K-rino-valley-of-decision-lyrics
Lifting the Veil,Alien Baby,2011.0,"As we go deeper
The veil of ignorance

Now we're lifting up the veil
Truth will never ever fail

Lift the veil, so we can uncover what the facade is
The best question a person can ask, is who God is
Right up the to the minute that I'm speaking, there are doubts
Of God's existence, his identity and his whereabouts
And life's purpose and how this universe functions
For eons, God hid Himself from amongst men
So confusion set in and after many years
Man developed his own philosophies and ideas
Of who the Creator is and how we all came
Without scriptural evidence to verify claims
Devils could wickedly arise aims
Who realized the truth and then intentionally exercised change
And over time the holiness was stripped down and took
God's word was not always in the form of a book
The laws and the wisdom was always told
To the prophets, originally and placed on a scroll
Which those who wanted to read, came and looked on
But eventually was compiled into a book form
The variations came through translations the Greeks knew
The original tongue and scriptures came from was Hebrew
The foundation of Christianity was drawn up from it
The Greek translation, was known as the Septuagint
A word meaning seventy and that number was taken
Because 72 scholars did the work of translating
The different interpretations are served as a deterrent
There were multiple versions that predated the current
The Bishop Bible, the Geneva Bible of Matthews
The Tyndale and the Wycliffe in 1382
The Vulgate and Martin Luther even had a version
By him the Old Testament was worded into German
In the 1500's but he let it be known
There was a Latin version in 400 BC by St. Jerome
It was many more who got hold of the word and mishandled it
And they got it from the Hebrew, original manuscript
Confusion whether you use a old one or a new one
The question is, with so many to choose which is the true one?
A few years ago, I eluded
To the fact in the Catholic Bible, seven extra books are included
Let me list 'em for those who might dispute it
1st and 2nd Maccabees, Ecclesiastics is the Tobit and Judith
The Baruch and the ""Wisdom of Solomon"" were dismissed
That's how it went from 73 to 66
And contradictions started landing
When man began to change God's words and lean towards his own understanding
Now modern day idol worship rules the mainstream
Christianity and Christ teachings are not the same thing
When the ruler Constantine became a Christian
He made men combine religious principles with the ways of the Pagans
Holidays like Easter were based on the phrase
That Jesus died and rose from the grave in three days
But if he died on a Friday it's untrue
And rose on a Sunday, then that would make it only two
They celebrate his birth in December, call it immaculate
But if you read the scriptures, then that timeline's inaccurate
See, shepherds don't have their flocks out in the winter
Which proves that the Christ was not born in December
See if Jesus was 33 and a half when he was killed
And his murder took place after the passover meal
Passover was in March or April, this is a fact
If he was 33 and one-half year, let's count back
See a half a year's 6 months, subtract from where I told ya
6 months from March or April is September or October
It's over, for truth many died and others bled
What did Jesus have to do with rabbits and colored eggs?
See the Pagans had a ritual when spring time came around
And women painted their bodies and hid till they were found
And homosexual men hid too
And whoever found them can do any sex act they chose to
With Jesus' name lies were bred
That tradition was passed down and that's the reason why you hide eggs
And if this is the true day then something's unclear
Why does Easter fall on a different day every year?
What is Thanksgiving about? Who were the Pilgrims?
The wicked criminals who tricked the Indians and killed 'em
You love Chris Columbus, but he was no friend of ya
He left Europe and got lost, he thought he was in India
63 years later, Africa's infiltrators
The motherland invaders, American slave traders
The devious thieves, who came to Africa to seize us
Transported the blacks on a ship named Jesus
Across the Atlantic, made stops in the Caribbean
Depicted Jesus' image as a blond European
Conniving, conditioned our minds and put the lies in
When Revelation 1:14 clearly describes him
This won't close till all of the lies have been exposed
The CIA and FBI knows of UFOs
See, some claim conspiracy and mock presented truths
Go research the evidence and documented proof
You can find 'em in the Bible, the prophets know what they are
In the book of Ezekiel, the wheel that he saw
The government knows they're real but it rarely surfaces
But more importantly they know what their real purpose is
Economy falling, people tricked by the government
Calamities and plays are all part of God's judgment
And in the end real truth is never curtailed
When the facts get covered up, we're lifting up the veil

Ha-ha-ha, come on lifting up the veil (lifting up the veil)
The veil of ignorance (yes sir)
Study (study), learn the truth
Don't just take what people say on face value
Do your research, yeah
I know you been taught like this all your life
I know what mama said, I know they didn't give you this in school
Elementary, middle school, high school, college
Even the church, so that mean it's up to you
Get your knowledge up
Don't be afraid to challenge the preacher and the teacher
Ask questions, read, learn history, true history
Oh yeah and there's a man names Elijah Muhammad
Check him out, ha-ha-ha, you might learn something",https://genius.com/K-rino-lifting-the-veil-lyrics
The Maven,The Maven,2013.0,"Tonight, on lyrical masterpiece theater
I will be reading one of my great works
""The Maven""

After years of mindless content and frivolous crap
A man became dissatisfied with the condition of Rap
The powers dumbed the lyrics down and made the listeners adapt
Soon this mental plague became a blinding mist on the map
But his vision was never phased because his eyes had been raised
Over time, he came of age and then grew wise in his ways
He reflected on the great artists and summoned the gall
Then he envisioned hearing one writer who encompassed them all
To overcome this ignorance, nothing was stalled in his thirst
He spent hours collecting, reading, studying all of their works
Travelled all over the planet where great thoughts were bestowed
Sat with priests, scepters and sages from all parts of the globe
Read relentlessly for weeks before deciding to speak
He mastered every vocal tone and every writing technique
A scholarly product with a self-made prodigy conscience
He memorized past, present and future bodies of knowledge
Organizing, knowing the solution soon to be born
His next step, compile it all into a humanly form
Though he was eloquent and delivered words with intricate timing
And possessed lyrical skill, he had no interest in rhyming
So he ventured down to his lab which had been his escape
And after working for 20 days straight, an image was shaped
He deposited all his wisdom, every infinite trait
And when he finished, he rendered what he had invented was great
His creation laid on the gurney, once summoned it rose
And instantly began to compose the most dominant flows
Every hour of the day, a different style he'd create
And when he spoke, every man, woman and child could relate
Just when it seemed the population might be hurled to its grave
The man smiled because he thought now that the world would be saved
And soon the sky is where the mental surface would be
He had successfully manufactured the perfect MC
The intellect that passed through his brain, the masses obtained
And within days the nature of the game had drastically changed
Through his sovereign will, deep marvellous thoughts were revealed
And those who held on to the madness, got slaughtered with skill
Lyrical prototype who wrote words for the love, not wages
And the greatness of his rap pages would pass through the ages
The motivation, to make meaningful songs was contagious
Each writer evolved daily through his creative stages
The negative ideologies of life were uprooted
The first 365 day cycle concluded
But on the 366th day it was strange
The creation the man had brought to life was starting to change
Accolades under his name and international fame
Until totally uncontrollable he slowly became
Intoxicated by his own flames, so arrogance reigned
The insane notion of world dominance mastered his brain
Exploitation of the game, through the skill that he used
He had evolved into the same thing he was built to remove
Trained and ingrained in his memory was unmatchable ability
Natural skill indeed, but he was lacking in humility
The builder watched his dream disappearing in haste
With tears in his face, his creation was clearly a waste
The mistake that he made in making a rapper of that caliber
He focused on talent and knowledge but added no character
Now it's racking the streets with a savage mystique
Deadly havoc he wreaks with every paragraph he would speak
So the man searched, travelling roads, famished and cold
Looking for a mechanical load in tyrannical mode
Since he designed him, he felt it mandatory to find him
The goal was to catch him, deactivate, then realign him
As he searched and explored, he saw things were worse than before
Heard a murderous roar, followed up by verses of war
He ran up to a door, where a stranger took him the key
Once inside the voice straight ahead said, ""Looking for me?""
And there he was, with a smile as if he liked that he'd found him
His mic was astounding, plus he had disciples around him
As the man approached he heard these three words, ""I dare you!""
He said, ""You're not yourself, come back to the lab, I'll repair you
I can't have you killing rap, so come with me I implore it.""
He said, ""Your existence versus mine, I'll battle for you it""
He thought and said, ""Oh no, I want no parts of a flow
Why would you turn against a man who taught you all that you know?""
That's when he laughed and said, ""I'm the one that you should kneel to""
He said, ""You stupid fool, you didn't build me I built you
Programmed you to be like me, I propelled this confusion
Every detail of our history's a spell of delusion
When I tried to teach you my plan you rebelled on the movement
So I banished you and held you in a hellish seclusion
My craziest deeds, you were just unable to heed
So the idea that you created me, I made you believe""
The man said, ""I worked on this for years, it's lies that you speak.""
He said, ""I made it to appear as years, it's only been weeks
I'm the architect of you and every bar that was formed
Raise your right sleeve, I'm sure you've seen that scar on your arm
How I assembled you is too complex to try to describe
But if you peel that scar you'll notice several wires inside
You were my greatest masterpiece, top of the line of my clones
But I developed you so well you gained a mind of your own
And started spreading conscious thought, east, west, south to the north
So I drew you out of solitude to finish you off
And though it's definite, you possess several lyrical elements
You're scared of expressing it, that's why you're vocally hesitant""
Discouraged, the man dropped his head and said, ""It's no use""
Looked at the wires in his arm and slowly pulled them a loose
Then both good and bad ideologies mentally flashed
The conscious forces and the wicked forces instantly clashed
And everybody in the room vaporized in a flame
‘til eventually the two men were all who remain
The anarchy that ensued caused the world to divide
And the followers of both sides began to collide
And then the ceiling opened up and they both looked in the sky
There they saw the the giant silhouette of a much bigger guy
He commanded everything to stop and nobody move
He said, ""This war is over right now and both of you lose
You lose because you took the talent that you possessed
And got obsessed with power and used it to conquer the rest
See you were blessed with the best, given the lyrical rod
You didn't build this man, that was a deceptive façade""
The other man said, ""I knew it but, sir, how did I lose?""
The giant said, ""You had the skill to challenge, but you refused.""
He said ""I came to fix him back, so this fight I'd avoid.""
He said, ""Some things can never be fixed, they must be destroyed
And though you tried to reason with him, don't believe you succeeded
Many were lost because they didn't have the wisdom they needed
See you deleted all your hard work, your moment was here
But you failed because your power wasn't strong as your fear
This test is completed."" They said, ""Who are you?"" Then I spoke
And said, ""My name is K-Rino and I created you both.”

Deprogrammed,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"As I pondered the thought of evolving as an artist
I was inside of my office meditating in the darkness
An uncomfortable pounding was hitting in my chest
When the patient walked in I was sitting at my desk
As my thought reached his height, the room became bright
Then I stood up and slapped him for turning on the light
Then I told him to be seated as he started to explain
How the negative influences had targeted his brain
""The ratchetness defeated my ability to fight it
I know that it's atrocious but somehow I've grown to like it""
In one minute I deciphered the symptoms, ""Shut up and listen
You've been poisoned and conditioned through audio repetition
And media false religions and visual exhibitions
The medicine to the sickness requires no prescription""
I opened up a cabinet a container was revealed
Then I told him to, ""Be still, lay back and take this pill""

""What are you tryna do?"" ""I'm going to deprogram you""
""What are you going to do?"" ""I'm going to deprogram you""
""No just let me go, I can't stand you, doctor damn you""
""You'll thank me when I'm through, just let me deprogram you""

It was obvious his mind was rejecting cause he was choking
Three seconds after he took it his body started convulsing
I've been doing this for years, I'm trained, I'm not a novice
So I recognized quickly an exorcism was in progress
The process wasn't clean, he was harder to redeem
This was one of the most extreme cases I'd ever seen
I expected little resistance but never a rejecter
Hooked his brain up to this thing that showed his thoughts on a projector screen
Every idea and dream he ever dreamed
Told my secretary Jean to bring me a nectarine
As I ate it I sat back and let the method take it's course
It rewound back eventually landing at the source
When the needle spiked hard I got anxious
I saw how the dangerous language came through his subconscious chambers
Initiating gradual changes that were rendering him brainless
The power blew and shorted out the main switch

""What are you tryna do?"" ""I'm going to deprogram you""
""What are you going to do?"" ""I'm going to deprogram you""
""No just let me go, I can't stand you, doctor damn you""
""You'll thank me when I'm through, just let me deprogram you""

My maintenance coordinator powered the generator
Then I placed him into great situational simulator
Filled his conscience with both beneficial and nonsense
Featured good and evil and monitored his responses
With weaker content his vessel paraded about
Anything positive, he regurgitated it out
I leaned over the table to scream, ""Don't let it break you""
This fake music was specially designed to overtake you""
The superficial nature of this garbage I revealed
""It's an audio mirage this stuff is not even real
It's only a spell they sent to keep your true potential in the basement
Demented strategic radio placement""
I thought it would get better but then I saw no chances
He started yelling, ""Turn up"" and doing funny dances
He seemed to be getting worse than he was when he came in
I hollered for my intern to come help me restrain him
He would die if I couldn't stop the ignorance from reigning
The clock was ticking down only two minutes remaining
To save him I was racing but he gave no indication
My track record's impeccable, I've never lost a patient
So failure I never knew, each second the pressure grew
Came to the conclusion there was only one thing left to do
He's nearly a vegetable, I have to handle this directly
Laid on the table next to him, told my intern to connect me
And effectively inject more intellect till he was stable
Similar to car batteries connected with jumper cables
But if it didn't work I would lose all my brain fluid
My intern said, ""Please don't"". I said, ""Shut up and do it""
When he plugged me to try it sparks flew from the wires
The lights were flicking on and off,the room was on fire
And purple communication after that was non-verbal
The screen said, ""Total completion of transferral""
The course had ran thorough but something was still concerning
In silence both of us were laid motionless on the gurney
The patient's eyes opened as the Sun beamed through the window
My team started removing the chords from our temples
He raised up and said he was healed, ""The method's proven""
They waited for me to respond, still I wasn't moving
They entertained the thought that I had let my tactics break me
They did everything in their power to resuscitate me
One of them read the bible as I laid there idle
And multiple devices were used to check the vitals
They shocked me, medicated me but still wasn't recovering
They worked to bring me back a whole hour but still nothing
Then grateful for my sacrifice and all of my devotion
They drove me 700 miles and placed me in the ocean
I floated out to sea as they cried and started grieving
They stayed the entire evening, said some words before leaving
They travelled home mourning the demise of the doctor
Returned to the facility to empty out their lockers
They came back to the building walked inside and nearly lost it
Looked down the hall and saw me watching TV in my office
Drinking a cup of coffee, relaxed trying to chill
As the patient tried to hug me, I just handed him the bill
Everyone was like, ""We thought you had suffered sure disaster""
I said, ""Yes, I know that's why you're the students and I'm the master

From the Sky,80 Minute Eternity,2010.0,"Think it, dream it, plan it, pray on it
Will it, build it, focus, stay on it
See it, chase it, believe it, channel it
Picture yourself with it before you physically handle it
Grab it, watch it, feed it, nurse it
Guard it from anyone who might attempt to curse it
Frequently treat it while never showing no weakness
Hold it and never leak it, keep your vision a secret
Work for it, no time for crying and debating
Understand patience doesn't mean lying round and waiting
It's a long road but you'll accomplish it if it's meant
If you running a marathon why would you practice for a sprint
Gotta build up your strength. through the pain and the suffering
If you train to fight fifty rounds, twelve ain't nothing
No gaining if you're complaining, no advancement if you're napping
Anything you tryna do, it's up to you to make it happen

We gotta learn that blessing don't fall from the sky
If you want something, be willing to do all that applies
Gotta get your hands dirty, persevering through the test
Say a prayer, get to work and let the God do the rest

Blessings waiting but impatience is running them away
Nothing happens overnight except the coming of a day
I heard a lot of people say they gotta see it to believe it
But believing in the unseen is the best way to achieve it
Gotta move on your vision, disregard what dollar said
God wants to raise you up but He can’t help you if you scared
So I wheeze through the distracting, the slander and the laughing
While wearing spiritual vests to protect me from dream assassins
“Now what’s a dream assassin?”, I appreciate you asking
That somebody you tell your goals and then they start blasting
Shooting at your dreams and tryna knock them off the radar
Tryna discourage you and make you miserable like they are
But a weak thinker can never conquer a strong mind
Keep pushing even if you think it might take you a long time
If you run into a couple of setbacks and then quit
That means you never had belief to begin with

We gotta learn that blessing don't fall from the sky
If you want something, be willing to do all that applies
Gotta get your hands dirty, persevering through the test
Say a prayer, get to work and let the God do the rest

The world is yours, you walking impassively with fear
You expect your problem’s solution to magically appear
Don’t be bathing in depression, you destined to be a great one
You need some money, stop begging for a job and make one
Never envy one's talent, go to the real source
Don’t be jealous of them, just ask God to reveal yours
Gain from your losses, whatever happened was meant to
Don’t let no felony, no drug habit or hate prevent you
Focus on your life several hours a night
You can’t fight the power till you gain the power to fight
“I ain’t finished school.” So what? “I had a child.” So what?
God makes a way out of nothing, punks fold up
Degrees and diplomas don’t guarantee dollars
I done seen drop out millionaires and homeless scholars
Like a said many times, my objective is to help you
‘Cause everything I’m saying, I’m telling it to myself too

We gotta learn that blessing don't fall from the sky
If you want something, be willing to do all that applies
Gotta get your hands dirty, persevering through the test
Say a prayer, get to work and let the God do the rest",https://genius.com/K-rino-from-the-sky-lyrics
Perpetual Ascension,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008.0,"Ah, here he go again
If your comprehension is low, leave the room now
Matter of fact, leave the Universe
We ain't got no room for you right now
I will not be held responsible for what I'm about to do

I reach octaves that illuminate at the hottest wattage
And drop gothic topics while I plot with my operatives in a cottage
K-Rino, I boa constrict the flow that you spit
Human DNA particles mixed with cobra and pit
I grab and slam you to the gravel like a gavel
My level is unpassable like a simultaneous backwards forward lateral
The grass I draft is super unnatural
I fly from Cape Canaveral
 through two galaxies in a capsule to battle you
We're syphilis that's absent of reasoning
Ashes burn, placed in a urn and dashed on red snapper for seasoning
I lead a primal legion, whose main reason for breathing
Is to cleat teeth in your vertebrae and start feeding off your spinal region
You got the mind rate of a primate
At the same time I climb straight to the peak of perfection in it's sublime state
Past, present and future millenniums
I live in 'em concurrently based on my mastery of space time continuum
Although his opinion was genuine
I was still forced to skin and mentally hinder him, which eventually ended him
My work baffled the medical examiner
The en fuego flow, twenty times the degrees of the Sun times its diameter
The Iambic contaminate handler, annual rapper ghost channeler
With amphetamine injected elephant stamina
I slap Socrates and Euripides
They fell to the knees to witness me deliver these magnificent epiphanies
My list had became inebriated
What I create can never be destroyed, yet I destroy things that are yet to be created
Jam K, you might Flambé
You ain't one-third of the rapper I was back when I was half the rapper I am today
You sweet as bakery pastry, I'm chasing you when you chase me
Blades protrude from my ribcage so you bleed when you embrace me
K-Rino is Amazing like Grace be
I'll become scalding liquid in the palm of your hands and dare you to waste me
You'll get the lid stripped from your eyes, kidneys ripped from your sides
Dying with your internals afflicted with hives
Brick hit till he dies a violence laced cryptic surprise
And these 5 that I mentioned are the only the beginning of your demise
Have you wetter than rain, every inch of your sweater is stained
Leave it to hang it might take a hundred years or better to drain
You couldn't gain a grain against a micro thread of my brain
I think ahead of the dude that thinks ten years ahead of the game
Nuclear physicist, rocket scientist, micro surgeons
Have difficulties deciphering my dumbed down versions
I cover space in a ship laced from the base of the vessels head
Where I'm from the average Earth genius is placed in Special-Ed
It's apalling, I give telekinetic responses when you're calling
A sword extends out of my face when I get angry, like a Marlin
I lived on Earth and platooned in Jupiter's moons
Acclimated and grew accustomed to all the gas and the fumes
I bless the faithful with a plate full of lyrics till they were grateful
You didn't see me at all in March 'cause I was waiting for you in April
Presided over a council of writers like the Presidium
Commissioned by God to interpret alien idioms
Samples of bone marrow sit on the tip of my arrow
Triple Darkness manifested even my shadow got a shadow
Helicopters came to raid with mic clutching brigades
I'm double-dutching through the propellers without touching the blades
Manifested treacherous messages that push you to the edge of this
Subjected you to breathlessness with two handcuffed necklaces
Matched with the best, some doubt my tactics
But the fact is, I practice with accurate microsurgical exactness
My lyrics confidentially concede
Created a process so extreme that it's even kept a secret from me
I black out like I received an injection
And resurrect with no recollection of intrepid ethereal verse conceptions
I gave language to man before the first letter began
Your skill can fit comfortably on the head of a pin
The imminent apotheosis of devious guys
Cut off my air supply, I promise you I'll breathe through my eyes
I'm a sniper with virtue, the universal cipher you work through
The curve that extends infinitely till it's a circle
The Saturn ring crown wearer with documented perilous terror
That dates back to the Paleozoic Era
As I stare in my esoterical mirror
Compared to you, technologically undetectable frequency sound clearer
The known lyricist in existence fearer
Suicide bomb rhyme blast a broadcasts daily on Al Jazeera
Merking him wasn't easy, I tried homie believe me
His spirit was scared to leave his flesh knowing it had to see me
My aura's great, it's too late to arbitrate my horror rate
Compared to me, you ain't even close to being far away
Reduce you to a pool of anemic blood and dive in you
Off the top of Mount St. Helen's I'm piledriving you
Embalm you while your alive and leave nothing inside of you
Split you into quintuplets and murder all five of you
Couldn't slice my verses if I hand you a knife
Hit you with every sickness listed in Merck's Manual twice
I'm the storm that came instead of the calm that was supposed to come
Before the storm but had nothing to destroy after I came along
My capacity for thinking detracted him
A miniscule ounce of my minimum is seven times more than your maximum
Take a day to battle you and when I'm finished
I'll go home and relax for the remainder 23 hours and 30 minutes

Perpetual Ascension
The dimension of my Perpetual Ascension
Perpetual Ascension
You've enter the dimension of Perpetual Ascension
Perpetual Ascension
You've enter the dimension of Perpetual Ascension
Lyrically lynching
You've enter the dimension of Perpetual Ascension",https://genius.com/K-rino-perpetual-ascension-lyrics
No Redemption,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"There comes a time when you gotta quit begging
And ask for something you ain't never gonna get
And recognize that this country don't love you, never did

Unjustified battle cries, whole planet dissatisfied
You and this country's marriage died, Bush and his Daddy lied
See you was listening to his words, while I was looking at his eyes
Burned after you fraternised, now you want to act surprised?
So mentally dead its stunning, Satan got you scared and running
Bailout plan was for the rich, ain't no jobs and ain't none coming!
Government been getting sloppy, now Barack’s a carbon copy
Got Saddam, got Bin Laden, made his dumb ass get Gaddafi
See they try to monopolize, I need land that I can buy
Keep your Wall Street, I got a soul I need to occupy
The USA be constantly spreading fake democracy
You got freedom of speech until you speak out against their policies
Every two blocks, liquor stores, fast food spots
New cops, treat crew plots, rocks and flu shots
Killing you intentionally, tricking you, promoting war
All of them are devils so don't ask me who I’m voting for

There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county
There'll be, no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, for Satan's system
There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county there'll be
No redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, come on

See it’s gonna be some stuff tonight, people wanna fuss and fight
When they speaking of the Christ, sorry but he wasn't white
See something didn't happen right, ask your pastor for advice;
If he say that blonde-headed cat is Jesus, slap him twice
Religious disparagement, too shaky to balance it
Understand a lie resembles the truth when you don't challenge it
God breaking the infrastructure of this whole establishment
They unaware of it because Americans are arrogant
They murder for the hate of it twice as worse as Adolf Hit-
Ler, how much time did Madoff get for what he made off with?
In this world we never win, same lie, they tell again;
I bet no houses in the hood look better than that cell he in
Paper-level in the red, people needing bigger bread
Before you vote for Rick Perry ask him about 'Niggerhead'
""Did you hear what that nigga said?"" Yeah, I said it now respond
Time to stand up, true soldiers fight and cowards run

There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county
There'll be, no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, for Satan's system
There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county there'll be
No redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, come on

My partner came home from Iraq, broke, driving a Pontiac
So tell me where the money at, tea party want their country back
Back from who? Now I’m laughing, republicans mad and avid
Can’t be talking bout the blacks and brown because we never had it
Look at how we’re sizing up, people mad and rising up;
How many more employees and jobs will they decide to cut?
Food bad, water bad, our conditions sort of sad
Mom and dad raise a child their sixteen year-old daughter had
Man’s law, God’s law, man the game is getting wild
2 women or 2 dudes can walk down the aisle to say wedding vows
Jail, college, jail, college, who gonna get your babies first?
Prison don't reform a man, if anything it makes him worse
College ain't the answer, why? That was said to pacify
Go to school and you can be whatever you want, that’s a lie
This country's a sinking ship, so destined for doom and pain
Frame smashed by an earthquake-sized boomerang

There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county
There'll be, no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, for Satan's system
There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county there'll be
No redemption, no redemption
No redemption, for Satan's system
There'll be no redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, for this county there'll be
No redemption, no redemption
No redemption, no, come on",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-redemption-lyrics
The Plan,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"What's the plan?
I'll reveal some of it to you

What's the plan? To not let you consciously advance
With mindless radio and television programs
Doping you up with new brands of illegal contraband
Once again activating the hand of the son of man
No regards for life, no chance for yours
Lies and more tax dollars financing wars
While you party and ignoring the news, they sign laws
Deceptively forming methods to keep you behind bars
Who rules the planet? The people. Who's over them?
The president ain't number 1, he got powers controlling him
Long before 9/11s nationwide fraud
America had been the master of the inside job
Any time there was a tragedy their face was in the picture
When the Rothschild family was breaking bread with Hitler
And all they ever did was enslave you and pillage you
Stop honouring a country that's responsible for killing you

Sound the alarm, the government is tryna do us harm
Don't worry 'bout the weather it's the calm until the storm
Pay attention to the mission 'cause these wolves about to get ya
Either do as they say or they'll take you out the picture

What's the plan? To profit off the poor man's habits
Pharmaceutical corps made a nation of drug addicts
They don't want a cure, they want money while you a dope fiend
I see the Devil every time I look at Osteen
It's Hell in the ghetto but it's better in the burbs
Country under control of the Federal Reserve
Wicked regime formed back in 1913
Our international bank has ruled presidents and kings
The truth covered up by these media water moccasins
Crush Bill O'Reilly, Hanity and Pat Robertson
All the evil alphabets, they can go to Hell
F.B.I., C.I.A. and 
A.D.L
D.E.A., the court system lets implode
The judge probably wearing some panties under his robe
They know that rule is over and that God's gonna get 'em
But the plan is to try to take the whole world with 'em

Sound the alarm, the government is tryna do us harm
Don't worry 'bout the weather it's the calm until the storm
Pay attention to the mission cause these wolves about to get ya
Either do as they say or they'll take you out the picture
Sound the alarm, the government is tryna do us harm
Don't worry 'bout the weather it's the calm until the storm
Pay attention to the mission cause these wolves about to get ya
Either do as they say or they'll take you out the picture

These snakes are pressing Mexicans with border patrol
Tryna keep off them off their own land, the land that they stole
Hypocrites, satanic people out to harm ya
Took Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California
With human life, they mercilessly experimented
The earthquake in Haiti, hell HAARP might of did it
They blame terrorism for every building that's blown
Most attacks on this country were carried out by their own
Every sick move left the poor infected by the cause
In the past they blew up their own ships to start wars
To put guns and dope in the hood, they decided it
They locked you up for it, when they're the ones who provided it
Now they mapping strategies average people ain't fathoming
Practising murder tactics whenever we have a gathering
Never had respect or knew what character was for
They just lived up to the label, America the whore

Sound the alarm, the government is tryna do us harm
Don't worry 'bout the weather it's the calm until the storm
Pay attention to the mission cause these wolves about to get ya
Either do as they say or they'll take you out the picture
Sound the alarm, the government is tryna do us harm
Don't worry 'bout the weather it's the calm until the storm

Cartoon Orgie,Stories From the Black Book,1993.0,"I went to a 'Cartoon Orgie', about a quarter to two
Saw Miss Piggy jacking off Winnie-the-Pooh
Yosemite Sam was fussing at this freak
Cause he heard she been riding Daffy Duck all week
Now Heathcliff smooth pulled up smooth driving a Caddy
Hounding the shit out of Peppermint Patty
Popeye boned Olive Oyl to the finish
What he ate that night made him say, ""Fuck spinach!""
Two of the Chipmunks had skipped a class
Now Casper's in the back making friends with that ass
Yogi caught Boo-Boo in the sack with Ranger Smith
They call him Boo-Boo because he's full of shit
Shaggy and Scooby-Doo was having a fight
Over who was gonna get to fuck Daphne that night
Snagglepuss stepped up and said, ""Be cool
Y'all ain't getting shit, she on her period fools""
Lion-O said I'll be back tomorrow
I'll have me a ho if I can catch Cheetara
Speedy Gonzales said, ""Forget it, I'll stop her""
Put some Spanish Fly in her milk, then he popped her
Goofy was fucking Wonder Woman undercover
She was burnt so he used Plastic Man as a rubber
Fred came with Wilma but he couldn't cut it
So Woody pecked that ass till Fat Albert nutted, yo
Oil Can Harry was tryna be slick
So Mighty Mouse came and beat him down real quick
A knock on the front door broke all the fun up
Bugs Bunny busted in holding a gun up

At the..
At the Cartoon Orgie
Ooh, I'm at the Cartoon Orgie

He said, ""Yo, I really hate to stall you hoes
But I'm here to pick my money up from all you hoes""
Mad about the freaks they had gone and got
So he sprayed George Jetson with a warning shot
But fresh out the clan was Peter Pan, a clever man
Came through with 4, 5 freaks from Neverland
Bugs lit a cigarette and stuck it
In his mouth, looked around, got naked and said, ""Fuck it!""
Bullwinkle had many mouths all wet
Richie Rich and Roadrunner ran a train on Smurfette
Walked in a room tryna get with mine
Caught the Wonder Twins in a 69
Sylvester the Cat saw Cheetara and Speedy
Got pissed off and started sitting on Tweety
Penelope Pitstop got pregnant (For real?)
It's Aquaman's baby but she blamed it on Garfield
Some chick was all over Barney's jock
Betty stepped up and they made the ""Bedrock""
Petunia Pig freaked every man in the place
I ain't gonna front, she even sat on my face

Annihilation of the Evil Machine,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Years before I ever existed
The war between the sadistic and the realistic had been predicted
The balance of the world's power shifted
When artistic control was given to the wicked and lifted from the gifted
When I was born, a female mystic
Insisted she entered the room leaned over my forehead and kissed it
Inside me my assignments were listed
I was never told this till I was older fearing the risk that I'd resist it
The first composition I ever composed
Triggered a conscious thought probe that the mystic had enclosed
I folded in an agonizing pose
When it was over I would hold the keys to expose the motives of the soul
Meanwhile on the same side of the globe
A slow-going entity drove the masses to ignorance overload
I stayed inside my reclusive mode and although this was strange
I still didn't complain though I blatantly noticed the change
I started having recollections
Nostalgic reflections of things that ignited mental resurrections
Now every audio visual object we digest
Contributes to this gradual degenerative process
Nonetheless I wasn't under stress
I just rested in convalesce, sharpened my talents to soar beyond the best
Fell asleep it felt like something was being put on my head
I woke up and saw two individuals at the foot of my bed
One said, ""Listen K-Rino you've been chosen to fight
The deadly force that germinated and rose in the night
All the knowledge that you'll need I'll expose on this flight""
'What's up with this paralysis? ' ""You're frozen in light""
'Well can you unfreeze me?
And please be quick about telling me the reason why you come to seize me'
He said, ""I'm sure you heard of the machine
Well we've convene concerning its destruction and we've chose you to lead the team
Folks are going to die, you have no choice so you better comply!""
I said, 'I was no one special, I'm just a regular guy!'
He said, ""That's a lie you were born for this never deny!""
I looked in his eyes and said, 'Okay man whatever I'll try'
Two seconds later I went from my room to on the craft
Inside the lab where I received training to run the staff
What seemed like one day of training had been a year
The mystic reappeared and said, ""No one must interfere!""
I said, 'Lady I could be wrong but I feel like I know you'
She smiled then said, ""You do and at the proper time I'll show you
As for the masses, there's a fate you'll have to save them from
Look at the people and how disillusioned they've become!
The thought streams that this machine is filtering
Are ill meaning and bewildering, you have to kill this thing!
You'll have to start with all of its compartments
And execute mark hits on targets from Earth or orbit""
After I listened I started on my mission
With one magician from the spacecraft, that's my assistant!
The first place he brung me had stunned me, what I saw living among me
Eighty-five percent were already zombies
The schools and the streets and the houses
Were doused with the venom of lying governments and sick media outlets!
All intelligent thoughts that sprout get, rerouted and ousted
I had to obliterate the whole outfit!
But where was its station? We tried to pinpoint its location
With extrasensory perceptive navigation
Two seconds after springing to action
I saw on the caption: ""The giant shadow of a robotic contraction""
I turned around and shockingly seen
A technicology supreme object that no logic could possibly dream!
Everything that it said was obscene
Plus his head was a screen, it blasted at me with a red-glowing beam!
I blasted back with a shot of my own!
Medulla oblongata lava fire straight out of my bottomless dome!
I heard a voice that made my hair raise, to paraphrase it said
""We'll forever convey our wicked ways over the airways
You can't stop the rise, we were put here to deceive the wise
We're the ones who slay the truth and make people believe the lies
Made the world slaves so don't defy it!""
To save it I would try it, it was modern day David and Goliath
This denial den that we resided in was multiplying
This leviathan was like trying to escape the Poseidon!
So every great phase that I ever spoken I quoted
Decoded, and overloaded his modem 'til it exploded!
When it blew up I was glad and released it
Till I seen new machines forming from each of the fragmented pieces!
Now I gotta overcome the offspring, the children of 'em
I went from dealing with just one to a million of 'em!
A whole army in the distance ahead
Imprisoners of listeners, tapped my assistant and said
'I need a G719 skill gun'
He said, ""I never heard of that"", I said ""I know I just made it up, go build one! ""
He left and said ""Okay I'll go get it; just hold them off for a minute""...
Sixty seconds later he reappeared with it!
I snatched it! With no time to study or test it
It consisted of just one definite button so I pressed it...

*Shots fired
*People Screams
*K-Rino coughs
Oh man!

I awoke in a cloud of smoke
I saw people one of them stepped out of the crowd and spoke
""It's so enlightening to be mentally redeemed,"" he said
I'm like 'What happened?' He said, ""Look all the machines are dead!
Conscious thinking at the ultimate degree again
No more government commercial radio or CNN
The gas released out of ya weapon made the camera's fall
Reversed the spell of the machine and deprogrammed us all""
I said, 'But there were millions how could we persist to live?'
""After the wisdom everyone took the initiative""
One by one they were individually destroyed
By everything with knowledge all functions deployed
They sparked the process with cerebral brain washing narcotics
Scientific control, anatomic robotics melodic hypnotics
The mystic then delivered my fate
Waved and erased my memory sending me back to my original state
You wonder how then was it told to y'all?
The thought probe was never taken out, it recorded the whole battle and showed it all!
Now future generations can say that they seen
The Total Annihilation of the Evil Machine!",https://genius.com/K-rino-annihilation-of-the-evil-machine-lyrics
Three Gods,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"Polytheism - The worship of many gods
Monotheism - The worship of only one
The title of this composition is called three gods
(Yeah)

I know three gods and none are the same
Three things that can all fall under the name
Some worship men and idols, others thunder and rain
Of the three gods I speak on which one do you claim?
Listen, polytheism is your enemy
Each god is a entity that prevents people from elevatin' mentally
And I ain't talking about the trinity
The three gods entered me sinfully manifestin' death when its sent to me

Money's the first god I speak on, some think that its wealth
We even place more value on money than life itself
Some might even take a life just to get it in hand
Money's replaceable but no one can recycle a man
The accumulation of paper leads to hatred and greed
Immoral seeds ain't planted in hearts, other entities breed
Like materialism those who feel like clothes and a car
Make the person, take that away it might expose who you are
It's the motivation of war making calamities start
Ramification of its misuse tears families apart
Can it buy you love and happiness? That's just a façade
Those things only come from building a connection with god
True indeed the love of money is the root of all evil
It makes a man prostitute women and sell dope to his people
Now the quest to gain new revenue is inevitable
It makes us fall for every single trick the Devil will pull

(Verse 2)
Drugs are the second god I speak on, which one do you use?
It's a multitude in the world now, so many to choose
Got people on speed broke, some agree that they need coke
Some worshipping marijuana baptized in the weed smoke
You can get you a upper or score you a downer
And now a days more people gettin high from over the counter
If dope ain't a god prove it, we'll discover who's right
It's everywhere, plus it calls you in the middle of the night
And in the dope bible, in the third chapter, the book of cocaine
Explains he who hitteth it once shall have no strength to refrain
And shall remain chasing a high, whether sunny or rain
And steal much stuff, making sure that the habits maintained
Seeking three rocks instead of trying to detox
You gotta beat blocks tryna get ten dollars for a pair of stolen Reeboks
Praying to the drug god from seven to seven
You must believe if you get high enough you'll end up in Heaven


Now the last god I speak on is the one called sex
It's natural which makes its analysis even more complex
It shouldn't be abused by anyone but the devious do
This third god is even used to get the previous two
Let me uncover this cause lust sits above the list
It's real dangerous in cases where no love exists
Multi-Dimensional 16 bars can't cover the ground
The truth is twice as hazardous when love is around
Sex is powerful, intended for only husband and wife
Used for unrighteous purposes but made to reproduce life
We all come from it some die for it, some live for it
And when its real good, ain't nothing some people won't give for it
Without mastery over it, it controls who it pleases
Used as a genocidal tool by way of deadly diseases
It's the reason we all exist, intentional to accidental
If you lack spiritual strength the physical impacts the mental
(Chorus)

There is only one god, the creator of the heavens and the earth
And you and I are created in his image and after his likeness
You can't bow down to money, you can't bow down to drugs, you can't bow down to sex
You were born to be like you father, a God
Stand up and be a god black man and woman
Stand up and take charge of your world
The world is yours",https://genius.com/K-rino-three-gods-lyrics
Imperfect,The Maven,2013.0,"How can I perfect myself, I just wanna learn the ways
Many chapters in the Book of Life, you gotta turn the page
Lying and chicanery, no more living dangerously
You ain't with me every day so you don't see the change in me
Yeah it's been a long road, evil got a stronghold
They say I ain't perfect, tell me something that I don't know
Running tryna make up ground, ain't no time to play around
Every time I plan my rise, others plot to take me down
Yeah man it's a dirty game, got them words from Murder One
Any time I'm 'bout to judge, I think about the dirt I done
I'ma try to find the top, whether people ride or not
Some say they have no regrets, I can't lie I got a lot
Keep your ignorant opinions, see I don't need none of them
There's only ten or twelve people I trust and you not one of them
I knew that I'd be criticised, slandered with opposing talk
So why would I complain about a path that I chose to walk?

Made mistakes while tryna build
I'm not perfect, but I still
Keep my focus, keep my pride
Don't allow no hate inside
I took some chances to prevail
Some would work out, some would fail
But in the end though none agree
When y'all are gone I'll still be me

It's getting harder to survive, all you wanna do is hide
Wished that you could make it stop, contemplated suicide
If you that stupid, try it, there won't be no intervention
Some people need help for real, you just tryna get attention
Put my demons on a page, exorcise 'em vocally
People criticize me daily, who the hell you supposed to be?
Judge me all the way through, hateful and ungrateful
Ridiculing me for tryna drop knowledge and save you
The damn nerve of you, I did that 'cause I loved you
Always walked among the people, never stood above you
My brain had no piece of time, tryna write some decent lines
Every move I made up in this shit I had the streets in mind
Never changed scenery, some hate me instinctively
You think I lose sleep worrying about what people think of me?
Lot of people know the truth, most of 'em just scared to tell it
Observing my soul, I guess they mad because I didn't sell it

Made mistakes while tryna build
I'm not perfect, but I still
Keep my focus, keep my pride
Don't allow no hate inside
I took some chances to prevail
Some would work out, some would fail
But in the end though none agree
When y'all are gone I'll still be me

You say that my work is worthless, in vain, not worth a damn
Well I guess there's plenty artist doing better than I am
With way more money, way more power, none of them you tryna touch
But if I'm so irrelevant, why the hell I'm on your mind so much?
In your eyes, governments and dirty cops do not apply
Dragon growling at you, why the hell you tryna swat a fly?
Y'all don't wanna unify, to you I've done nothing, dude
I ain't poisoning the food, I ain't shooting up no schools
I ain't selling dope and guns, I ain't stealing from the poor
You must be a undercover agent, who you working for?
Go at me, I'll go at you, make sure that you tell 'em that
Any time you see success, you'll see where the jealous at

Made mistakes while tryna build
I'm not perfect, but I still
Keep my focus, keep my pride
Don't allow no hate inside
I took some chances to prevail
Some would work out, some would fail
But in the end though none agree
When y'all are gone I'll still be me",https://genius.com/K-rino-imperfect-lyrics
Love Yourself,Time Traveler,2006,"Live, learn and move ahead because we've all been burned
There's only so much you can give and not receive in return
Don't let it stress you out, view it as a bump in the road
Because it'll have you looking around the house looking for something to load
I know the whole situation girl, I know what he done
Ran game, lied and left you one deep with a son
You gave him everything and got nothing and that's a shame
Now looking at your own child's face brings back pain
Because when you see him, you see the man that did you so wrong
You get hard, harder to feel like you can raise him alone
And I know you can, hell you've been doing it this long
But packing all the weight for years makes it hard to be strong
You better take a little time out to gather yourself
When no laughter is felt just all tears that's bad for your health
Don't get caught up in emotion, learn to hover above
You stop loving yourself, you won't be there for others to love

If you don't love you
You can't love no one else
How can you love someone
If you don't love yourself?

This fellow pumped up your head with the words that he said
Not even 24 hours later he had you in bed
Said it was you and him forever and that he was your man
To infatuated to understand his ultimate plan
Now you done broke ties with family and got with him fast
He educated you on street hustles to bring in cash
You was sceptical at first but he sold you a dream
He hit you with the ""if you loved me, you would do it"" routine
Now you out there on the streets and stripping up in the club
Selling your body and drugs and this supposed to be love?
You looked for it up in the wrong place and went with the flow
Now you stay high because your self esteem is low
And every day you seem to fall off just a little bit more
Your appearance ain't even the same as it was before
You gave your heart to a man who didn't have one of his own
And when he found somebody new to use he left you alone


Now you grew up in a household that wasn't too stable
Used to dream about leaving but you just wasn't able
A dysfunctional family, momma was rarely around
With an abusive father peace of mind could rarely be found
It's real had being raised up in a house full of fools
Somehow you never let that hold you back from going to school
Momma got a drug problem but she's in denial
And your own father molested you since you was a child
You done lost your innocence at a real young age
Lost faith in all men and feeling pent up rage
Depressed and suicidal, feeling heartless and cold
Blaming yourself for something that you couldn't control
But don't ever feel like there's nothing that you could do
You can have a brand new life but it starts with you
You could still make a good man a wonderful wife
Don't let life take you over just take over your life

Perfect World,Alien Baby,2011.0,"Can you imagine a place, where all the trials
And tribulations of the world, don't exist ha-ha
It's a real place, but right now it only exists in man's mind
Because the reality of it is that, until the time comes
For you to get there, you can only picture it
So what I wanna do, is give you a sneak preview of it
From my perception, yeah, watch this

Nothing but happiness and peace felt daily
A place where your children and babies can play safely
Where people genuinely believe in being friendly
No such thing as hatred and no memory of envy
With no problems to face every morning when you awaken
You can sleep with doors wide open and nobody will break in
Where love's force field is too solid to be shaken
Where each child grows up to be great women and great men
No depression or loneliness and no sad moments
And people full grown who've never heard of being homeless
Where we manifest our gifts and no dream is too distant
And there are no hospitals cause sickness is non existent
And love perpetuates itself,
 while no child suffers
And treatment of one another is not based around color
And you'll never hear slander come from anyone's tongue
And a hundred years old is still considered young

In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise
And see the whole world, through God's eyes
In a perfect world, no war no crime
In a perfect world, we would share one mind
In a perfect world, and all we see
Is peace, and real L-O-V-E

Nations wouldn't verbally spar with one another
Point out flaws or seek to go to war with each other
Each person has a place and a purpose destined to flourish
No child is ever hurt or malnourished,
 
money is worthless
We learned in the most spiritually advanced schools
And everything is done God's way, no manmade rules
And poverty is no longer in man's vocabulary
Erased from human thought, recollection or dictionary
No dream, the most wonderful thing you've ever seen
Every living being gleaming with infinite self esteem
And belief in the all wise, ruler and best planner
We walk the planet in the most harmonious manner
Where those who rest and hid, get uncountable blessings
Total strangers are trustworthy with your most prized possessions
If a man gives his word, he keeps it with no deception
And a mind full of knowledge is the only loaded weapon

In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise
And see the whole world, through God's eyes
In a perfect world, no war no crime
In a perfect world, we would share one mind
In a perfect world, and all we see
Is peace, and real L-O-V-E

Is this Heaven or the hereafter, the geographical area post rapture
The Book of Life's unclear chapter
If it's in the sky, then who derived it?
Find someone who's ever died and visualized it and returned here to describe it
Since none, have carried out that mission
The question isn't if it's real, the question is is it a place or a condition
See Heaven has a great description, but men exaggerate and create division
Make up written lies and fabricate depictions
So stop imagining, and understand the basics
Your place being in a heavenly state is self created
That old statement life is what you make it, is a true one
Your old existence erase it and replace it with a new one
See years of resentment left your progress restricted
New love can never move into your heart till hate's evicted
And this place that I've pictured
Look inside if you wondering where is it, you don't have to give your spirit up to visit

In a perfect world, there would be no pain
In a perfect world, no stress no strain
In a perfect world, we would all be wise
And see the whole world, through God's eyes
In a perfect world, no war no crime
In a perfect world, we would share one mind
In a perfect world, and all we see
Is peace, and real L-O-V-E",https://genius.com/K-rino-perfect-world-lyrics
Tower of Sadness,The Maven,2013.0,"For we are opposed around the world
By a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
That relies primarily on covert means
For expanding its sphere of influence on infiltration
Instead of invasion
On subversion instead of elections
On intimidation instead of free choice
On guerrillas by night instead of armies by day

What are the causes and the seeds of depression?
Who's ultimately affected? These are the questions
We all stand guilty and in need of a blessing
So we weave through the scriptures to read as a reference
Foundations were laid years ago etched in
Neglect and rejection sent you in that direction
Your heart was exposed with no type of protection
The innocence you displayed was met with aggression
Lethal Injection to my trust of the masses
In the vein of my good side the needle was cast in
Seeking to find peace in an hour of madness
Tryna stop adding bricks to my tower of sadness
Every day the hurt builds, deeper and deeper it drills
Nobody is understanding so I keep it concealed
All these artificial people say they're keeping it real
False happiness in alcohol, reefer and pills, come on

Tryna find my way through all this darkness in my life
In the meantime until that day, I keep running towards that light
And even if I don't succeed at least I know I did my best
All day long I keep on running till I reach that happiness
(Happiness)

They sit watching me closely, hesitant to approach me
Hoping that I'll let a professional diagnose me
Instead of communicating, they wait to sedate me
Making me deflate to unsafely medicate me
And turn me to a vegetable with anti-depressants bro
A cocktail of Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro
The Prozac and Cymbalta make my moods alter
Not only mentally but my physical started to falter
So hard, O Lord, no money, no job
Won't starve. Options: sell dope, go rob
Can't seem to get no peace of mind, it's so
Chaotic and frustrating, borderline schizo
Deal with it, get help, must make a fast choice
Conversations in my head, good voice, bad voice
""Don't jump"", ""Jump now"", somebody come help me
I just wish that me and my own head would accept me

Tryna find my way through all this darkness in my life
In the meantime until that day, I keep running towards that light
And even if I don't succeed at least I know I did my best
All day long I keep on running till I reach that happiness
(Happiness)

Mindstate not good, hurting since childhood
Over time your heart got harder than plywood
Trying to avert war, peace is what you search for
Abuse from your parents constructed the first flaw
From love they disarmed you, the drugs only harm you
The mental facilities they build don't reform you
Every night you fight to not use the rifle
Your offspring heirs is the generational cycle
If tears could come out my eyes I would have been crying
They must be going backward and drowning me from the inside
Depression is testing me a real problem I might have
Stress is the ocean and I'm floating on a life raft
Prayers in my head but I'm too shook to dial one
Everybody claim they got faith until the trial come
Long as you live you gonna have to face a lot of tests
You can take God all day with no side effects

Tryna find my way through all this darkness in my life
In the meantime until that day, I keep running towards that light
And even if I don't succeed at least I know I did my best
All day long I keep on running till I reach that happiness

Multi-Reflex,The Maven,2013.0,"I'm the indeterminate learner nocturnal block burnin' inferno
Permanent earner mercury alien language discerner
Digital surfer, the lyrical murder miracle server
The mystery un-earther, physical inertia reverser
Terrorist missions, hellish perilous weather conditions
My mental's infinite no instrument can measure the distance
Deeply egregious devious deeds I read to the ether
Seize you and bleed you with evil deadly weekly procedures
Words with a purpose come to birth and emerge at the surface
Clergy is nervous, cryogenically preserved all my verses
Passin' at passes the savage blast mashin' his glasses
Bastards are cash trash bags mass packages of cabbage
Vocally sickenin', I threatened him I hope that he listens
No he ain't missin' he just hangin' from a rope in my kitchen
K is the ruler, for 27 days I'ma school ya
Phrases go through ya, extremities I keep in a cooler
Many know how my loaded words semi blowed
Vocals grow when it 20 frozen flow embryos
Then they gently go in your ventricles
Where the empty bodes of intentional chemically loaded indigo
Your rapping's laughable, my actions are classical
Picture me in Africa chasin' a ravenous pack of wolves
Serial killer scenes from here to the Philippines
Vivid dreams of vicious guillotine gorilla swings
In a room with atomic boom doom devices
Priceless 27 foot harpoons I write with
Consuming the light that's giving the Moon its brightness
Causin a lunar crysis cosmic unicyclist
Homicides what im mentally preoccupied with
Frightenin hybrid category 105 spit
Wreckin' effortless mesocephalin cyberneticist
Slippin peppermints of slick messages in your beverages
The incredulous pessimist the weaponless exorcist
Swellin' his neck with a infectious leprous ephelis
And I'm drawin life from it, meterorite comin'
Found me rummagin' around inside a parasites stomach
Poisonous paragraphs that'll probably have
Your body on a slab in a toxicology lab
You're obviously innocuous illogical and provocative
Droppin my topics and leavin the populace inoperative
My overnight solar light poltergeist
I throw the mic from shoulders height like rollin' dice and fold the planet over twice
Cold as ice, flow writin prototype
Who's open strikes are so precise I'm like a saber tooth tiger with a overbite
Flames I spit, lames angrily questioning the range of it
Indefinite pain came from intestinal entanglement
Feeble MCs grieve what I conceive is the evil is my reason
Like meat cleavers stuck deep in your trapezius
My writin' task crafted in mic class
My hands are so lightening fast I did a 7 second triple bypass
Some place waited among greats made ya to pump breaks
As I angrily truncated your lung space
8 ton weights on my tongue base
Able to run states and be back in place by the end of my lunch break
An hour late statement in one take
Was skating on the Sun and showed up to my born day 2 months late
Pardon me recital amalgamated your life
I'll evaporate it and then eternally micro encapsulate it

Deeper Elevation,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"It seems though the deeper I get, the higher I get
Let's try to decipher the concept of two words that are totally unrelated yet go so well together
There are so many

My brain's hard to explain like a no pain migraine
An underground airplane, a wet flame or dry rain
My cerebral functions so well it makes success fail
I'll tell you how to combine an inhale with an exhale
(Do it) When you wanna speak my shallow response is deep
From underneath where monsters creep in a state of conscious sleep
Under the glow of unlit lanterns I print my anthems
Shrinking expansions as I throw calm tempter tantrums
I'm untouchable like non-contact violence
I bust ear drums with loud high volume silence
Awoke comatose, big losses you won the most
I quote a humble boast, I took no pills and underdosed
I chased my destiny passive aggressively
My recipe for records be simple complexity
I skin throats with five million and ten volts
Then offend folks with complimentary insults
Your raggedy threats were rapidly addressed
I'm so relaxed when I'm stressed yet I'm happily depressed
Take a giant like Goliath be and make him scream quietly
Each time creatively I provide the same variety
Expose the secrets in your society and your diary
You're in denial that I am undeniably fiery
To properly see me your eyes gotta be closed
Even mind control chaos is way out of control
My tongue is wanted for all the trouble it conjures
It lunges multiple puns and double entendres
Lurking to hurt your team with a mean backwards inertia beam
I work my scheme cause I'm so perfect even my dirt is clean
Narcotic free I was sober but straight leaning
And I seem to have nightmares while I'm daydreaming
What I said might wake up the living dead
I chase bread to make sure my green is never in the red
Remember this I'm twisting this mental by placing emphasis
On every sentences many similar differences
My shortest flow stint was larger than your length
Which clearly means, my weaknesses are stronger than your strength
Talents naturally expand, no one's handing me the rules
So to scan my clues man is understandably confused
As I battle these emcees I see flawless fallacies
While simultaneously winning with normal abnormalities

Let us reflect on the future of our past",https://genius.com/K-rino-deeper-elevation-lyrics
Blood Doctrine,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"I got so many things working against me
Serpents and merchants of death working intensely with the purpose to lynch me
A young person who feels like I been on Earth for a century
I was questioning my worth before the birth of this entry
I walk on cursed surfaces where merciless men be
Who shirk the love I send and reimburse it with envy
What once was a full vessel is now worthless and empty
Recollections of sin tempt me through superlative memory
See you'll be still fronting and worshipping jewelry
While I'm trying not to let the force of gravity pull me
To disaster
, evil forces I'm trying to master
My blood is draining faster I'm living on plasma
Tryna stay calm and drop this gun clip out of my palm
Tryna to keep the governmental microchip out of my arm
And at this rate can we advance, hypothetically a chance
Getting sicker from eating food that's genetically enhanced

Don't get locked in, locked in (locked in) locked in

The gift that God gave me saved me but never truly paid me
I need angels to show up daily with harps to serenade me
My motivation escapes me and I can't relate to a world that hates
And tries to recreate me
, 
so they disassociate me
From the masses, so I patiently wait till time passes
I sit in the back of the class unnoticed in dark glasses
Watching these ignorant bastards boast and show gull
Allowing them to shine knowing I have the power to kill them all
Yet I fall back with deep humility and state my hand
The book said, ""A prophet has no honor in his own land""
So I expand expediently far beyond the sea
Forced to leave because my own tree wouldn't respond to me
Mistreated the women who bled, put wisdom in your head
Tryna duck and dodge the faulty education I was fed
I'm the Sun, the Moon, the star and all in between
The fire, the water, the deep dream, the black king

Don't get locked in, locked in (locked in) locked in

Man they got you, one drop, they only need an increment
Universally recognized through distinguishment of your fingerprints
Freedom relinquishment known in every single precinct you went
Tapping instruments, hear your plans soon as ya think of it
They snatch you and violate embedded God rights
Then they catch you with paper trails and credit cards swipes
Make you contemplate if it's real and worth the whole deal
Population management through use of birth control pills
You signed it and now there ain't nothing they can't do to you
Depending on what computers do
, 
fiending for pharmaceuticals
A hand that Shaitan raise and damage you for days
The evangelistic wave of a man with wicked ways
You signed it, the Hell driven covenant for instance
Loving the system enlisted for government assistance
You figured the best name was the name that he was giving ya

Antagonistic Radio,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"Thanks for tuning in to Antagonistic Radio
Tonight's guest is underground rapper: K-Rino
We'll be covering a few topics heavily
Like politics, religion and his new album 'Therapy'
Welcome to the show K, how are you this Saturday?
I'm good. Thanks for being here tonight. Thanks for having me
We'll, I'm not real familiar with your music, actually
Enlighten our listeners on who you are. Gladly, G
Well I started writing lyrics back in '83
Doing it as a hobby, long before it started paying me
The neighbourhood where we hang, we rapped and let the beats bang]
And what is 'SPC', is that some kind of street gang
Nah man, we ain't no gang, we just a rap group
So if I got loud and pushed you. I'd probably slap you
So you condone violence. Depends on the scenario
Mainly self-defence, disrespect, that's anywhere you go
But on the cool, why are you asking silly questions dude?
I'm just tryna get an understanding. But your questions are rude
I know that alcohol and drugs rappers use a lot
How many times have you been shot? What? How many tattoos you got?
Neither one, all that stuff is a stereotype
False media hype made for tricking and scaring your wife
You say it's 'hype' but I have to disagree with ya
How come you rappers always blame your image on the media?
Well the things that they let people know go much deeper, bro
They only show the bad side with the motive to deceive the whole
Lies and propaganda feed the soul and folks believe what's told
But how many TV and radio networks do we control?
Now, you blame the corporate powers, wow that's seems absurd
Let me apologize to listeners hearing these lies
I get it, you must be one of those conspiracy guys Haha
Who think the government's the reason streets are filled with crack
They plotted war to steal Iraq and police wanna kill the blacks
That was good, you made my job easy that was real exact
But everything you trying to joke about can be revealed with facts
A million stats, yeah, the system's still running scams
While we sit a home watching Maury and Bill Cunningham
I represent the media, allow me to respond
Man, you host a little radio show, you just a peon
A feeder fish in a large pond tryna copy them
Wishing you could be on CNN with O'Reilly and them
So what about the black-on-black crime and disunity
The sex and drugs you rappers like to glorify musically
That's what you say but you got some dirty songs of your own
Yeah I made a lot of bad songs back in the day
Now I watch what I say because it ain't wise me rapping that way
But while you thinking you revealing something major
You looking like a fool, my fans know my whole history, player
I've seen and done it all, the good, bad, the ugly
So I rap about my flaws to help others, that's why they love me]
Well, I hear you okay, but on another note
You seem to be dissatisfied with government, do you vote?
[Heh, vote for what? vote for who? Be for real
Though I wouldn't discourage nobody from voting if that's how they feel
If that's your choice, make it happen, I ain't stopping you
Do it cause it reflects your best interest not cause it's popular]
Can we talk about racism? 
Your lyrics spew a lot of Nation of Islam doctrine
Do you endorse Minister Farrakhan? [Absolutely
Anything that he speaks, he drops the proof on them
The government just mad cause he tells the truth on 'em
You talking crazy G, there's nothing you can say to me
The black man been mentally broken down since slavery]
There you go, blaming whitey for the Negro situation
When you spend your whole lives on welfare and probation
Won't you go to college and get a real education
Blah, blah, well back to the music
[Cool, and my album's not called 'Therapy', dude, it's 'Therapeutic'
It just dropped, if y'all want one holla]
Hey let's go to the phone lines and take a few callers
Caller, you're on the air K, what's going on, man?
 I just wanna say I appreciate what you saying
 The host is a snake, though, he outta line
Keep on checking that fool Woop, it looks like we're outta time
But one more question, one more thing
You seem to have a negative view of the mainstream
I just wanna know what started it, let's get to the heart of it
I think that you're upset because you wish you were apart of it
[Wish I was apart of it? You gotta be joking
Why the hell I wanna rap about strip clubs and smoking
Selling dope and leading folks to addiction in prison
Representing satanic Illuminati symbolism
For some money] So you're saying if it came down to it
A million dollars for a beer commercial? 
Oh my goodness
[[See, the entertainment industry's filthy
From music to cinema, all of them guilty
All of them] Guilty of what, giving you thugs a deal?
Making us glorify that nonsense instead of what's real
Feeding trash to the world] Which ones are you talking about?
[Warner Brothers, Colombia, Sony and Paramount
Fox, Walt Disney, MGM, Universal]

Extreme Malice,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Well planned musically studious translucent exuberant
Grand luminous pugilist, hand movements are numerous
Land cruising with prudence and transfusing my nutrients
Ran through the unruly with man proving elusiveness
Use a quick precision, I'll envision then inflict the collision
That makes the people in pictures switch positions
I've never been typical, lyrical physics inexplicable
With monolithic pull and predicting the unpredictable
Most slick rhetoric in my edifice
Let it be said and registered within your head that's it's better never to question this
Negative vibe premise, my hand grows to the size of Kawhi Leonard's
And slaps you for 75 minutes
Never rest, my cleverness forever will self-express
Effervescent and unpleasant yet it's wretched with 
epiglottis
I slept with intrepidness, prerequisite second guess
Reset you by shaking you for 3 seconds like Etch A Sketch
If you magical, then I can match that
I'll become a gnat and fly around the track with a strap and a backpack
It'll be the same as if it was my frame that did it
My brain is different, you'll need a portal crane to lift it
You flame and disperse but you won't put my name in a verse
I'm a dangerous person, in handcuffs changing my shirt
I'm analytical and leading on a spiritual retreat
I can speak and sweep Sunday to the middle of the week
Fighting exhibitions, true demolition, no benedictions
Unlimited rounds, 2 hours each with no intermission
My poetic sheets carry a heavy speech
When shredded each fragment released becomes a 23 pound confetti piece
I swarm and disable, alarming and fatal, respond if you're able
Word embalming you on the coroner's table
Exhibited vivid tunes, I'll be ripping on your television soon
Bust a flip and then land in your living room
Skill monopoly owning the property
I'm tryna be the cause of all MC families cashing in life insurance policy
The high agility soliloquy
Lyrically every CD I release individually’s equal to a trilogy
Diligently assembling theories that be so superior
It would be silly for even me to try to mirror me
K'll put you in pillars and let you look at me till I kill an entire villa
Reality couldn't be realer
The singular king of this bringing this mean and fiendish clique to the scene to spit
Touch you and leave no distinguishing fingerprints
Anyway you script it I'ma blaze and rip it
I'm 3 times as gifted like a birthday for triplets
I'm lathered and bathed keratin, plus I had a dream
That my neck was an ammunition carrying magazine
With emphatic radical patterns that ejected from the throat
And can render you ineffective from the second that I spoke
And I'm leaving the record broke for the most heart severed check with a quote
Whole populations with one stethoscope
My obsession to be the best is so special
I bet you that I could give you a 7 century head start and still catch you",https://genius.com/K-rino-extreme-malice-lyrics
Flawed Technology,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Everything meant for good is being used for evil, everything meant for good is being used for evil

Flawed Technology Universal Dichotomy
Malicious policies part of the fulfillment of prophecy
Morally corrupted experiments are conducted
Our impoverish state has been intricately constructed
Guillable people tricked by the ones who shouldn't be trusted
Some were to be the guinea pigs others would be the puppets
Efforts to twist our brains be done and open plainly
Science and medicine being utilised inhumanely
The people with control of the system they be the evilest
Deceiving us with poison ingredients that they're feeding us
These are just a few of the treatments they put to frequent use and what they seek to do is remove your power to reproduce
Falsely educated your children you think you saving em
Nothing was wrong with your baby til you vaccinated em
He's like a war victim in the MMR prison cause the shots from these vicious frauds gave em Autism
No matter what the doctor's speaking the sickness only deepens diseases are needed just to keep profiting from the treatment
Everybody's consuming em never become immune to em 
straight injecting humans with Mercury and Aluminum
 Harvesting your organs a raw and a savage thing and feminizing the men with the chemical ATRAZINE they placing it in the water and soon it becomes apparent and its mission is to trigger a hormonal imbalance
They use the people just like labs rats and lab monkeys self monitored robotic social media junkies and keeping everyone in one pool is their intention like fools we enlist to be tools of their inventions
So simultaneously they can keep a eye on society cause people using Facebook and Twitter as open diaries
Autobiographies of debauchery not knowing that there's someone in their headquarters watching these and we divulge our whole life's situation no moderation willingly giving information up with no provocation then what? What's on the TV you believe every clip then from CNN and FOX NEWS they read you the script and just because they show you something still don't guarantee it got to be skeptical to believe it even when you see it
So many versions of what happened and options to put it they can manipulate the story line and doctor the footage
They spying on citizen using unscrupulous means meanwhile we use our smart phones to do the stupidest things to the point of them destroying us we seem to be close and they study your mind based on the things that you post
Mentally engineered self hatred deep from within body implants, plastic surgery and bleaching your skin
Then we weakly defend acts that place us in the slow grinder cause the worthless things that we major in are so minor 
Sophisticated killers now conspiring a plot
They skillfully assassinate you without firing a shot
Could be a activist they hate a politician in office
The murders of em all are marked down as natural causes
Tampering with the forces of nature they sick and remorseless silent executors poisoning the planets resources
Generations of violations irreparable damages
Technology misused for military advantages
Television programming that programs who watches it hypnotizing us all from intelligence to the opposite
It's mostly done for control and proceeds
Genes pumped into animals to double their growth speed
The invention of spy drones that seeing your place
Plus cameras and satellites that can spot you from space
Facial recognition devices, RFID chips
Anything used for evil Satan's world is equipped

Forensics,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"I flow in a boastful motion then go into a postal explosion
That angers oceans and causes coastal erosion
A non-negotiable rogue choking, left throats broken
I'm not sociable but I'm open to smoke you into lotion
Millenniums might appear before your sight clears
Point blank range to K-Rino's a million light years
I hang in the high planes get paid to use slang
In battles my molars change into rattle snake fangs
My brain is a Saturn thrown arrow
My cerebral waves travel to a depth that will make abyss' look shallow
Each page of my speech holds the rage of a beast
On a stage I laid in a locked cage on a leash
A literary stake I drive in ya
They call me the 'Cinco de Mayo Killer' cause I may put five in ya
Infect you with a sick line that'll stay alive in ya
The CSI guy might die when he starts describing ya
I bomb ya with deep extreme New Jack trauma
Yet I'm calm enough to sleep between two black mambas
Butt naked without a suit of armor or gun or snake charmer
And if it's cold I'm a hold 'em next to me to stay warmer
My malice extreme, I ravish through talented teams
I was seen tearing a spleen on a balancing beam
Through time no one has written more historical lines
And left family members crying and picking floral designs
See these stupid guy utilize foolish pride, my vocals shot through his ride
Didn't hit him but scared him so bad the fool just died
Left him crucified with a noose applied
Charged me with double murder his soul left his flesh and committed suicide
Neutralize crews, how can you survive?
My paper and pen explode like planets and meteors when the two collide
You was tried then euthanized
Me with a mic is like an arsonist and blowtorch unsupervised
What I shoot will make Jupiter move aside
Magnificent lyrical bigamist, verbal homicide is my newest bride
Separate the truth from lies
Treat ya like fast food places do your fries, murder you supersized
See your death hand was willingly dealt
I got a stealth that will make facilities melt in my utility belt
I'm the paradox, the earthquake, the damage and the aftershocks
My teeth are like jagged rocks that can chop and snap an ox
It ain't my fault you're pretending
I say the same rhyme twenty times with twenty alternate endings
I'll chase them down till I catch 'em
And if he flex I'ma stretch him across the electromagnetic spectrum
I cut writers to confetti
, 
I'm the lyrical Jim Kelly
I got the beast trapped in my belly
He studied every line, said he had a style that he had perfected
But I bet his petty mind's not ready
My head's the conduit, the energy runs through it
Write one bar and give you a year to respond to it
All these dudes is rooted in foolish music, don't misconstrue it
Label new recruits are clueless, they grew from garbage to sewage
I'm the shrewdest human moving, consuming nuclear fluids
Proving I'm the truest, tutor students from Jewish to Buddhist
If he so chooses, we'll manoeuvre to the Moon to do this
I'm the coolest and you ain't got nothing on me like a nudist
My rhyme is a time of scientific assignments
Subject you to simultaneously variations of climate
While my rep grow, your flows pinker than Pepto

They almost got me
Nobody said the war would be easy to win
Let's go

I'ma get you off me, my Lord
Since I can't kill them softly, they die hard
See 'em floating all around me
Cause they trying to get inside my mind

Self-sabotaged, savage hard, now I'm forced
To map a course through the forest of my callous thoughts
It's crazy cause the saddest part is when the laughing starts
I had a spark but that was lost in the albatross
The guilt process tries to relinquish my options
Guess that I've been victimised by me thinking wise topics
Two psychiatrists enter with synchronized watches
Asking what my eye optics see in these ink defined blotches
How many purposely were buried in my word debris
Even I suffered extreme amounts of hurt from me
No disrespect to y'alls worldly universities
But they ain't qualified to service these ghetto emergencies
The plotting heathen finally got even
I'm trying but not breathing, anxiety not leaving
They ask me what I do at night for entertainment (Well)
I fight to maintain possession of my sanement


Tryna make it work but it's not falling in line
Got people tryna tell me that it's all in my mind
Everybody worried, keep calling and crying
Wanna check me out but I keep stalling for time
And money ain't the remedy, I can't let it tempt me
Bank account full but my soul is still empty
Ticking like a time bomb, my attitude is explosive
I'm the biggest enemy I got, I keep me the closest
Evil entities invade us but we can't let 'em take us
Want the demons out your house, you gotta serve 'em the eviction papers
Say preacher, you ain't doing what you should
Your church is empty cause your words don't touch the hood
We suffocating, no ventilation, we all grieving
I'm tryna turn some lights on in my dark regions
Something calling me to come but I refuse to go
Trying not to lose it, bro, thank God for music though


Yeah, gotta shake this demonic heat
Bad thoughts jugging at me when I'm tryna sleep
The wolf be disguised as an honest sheep
Looking like a pretty goldfish with some piranha teeth
I try reclining on the sideline comfortably
Ain't wanna work for my soul, I wanted something free
But in the end, cast out, I ain't the one to be
I flipped the game around and made the Devil run from me
Don't be fooled just because they giving y'all bread
You're not alive unless you know they want us all dead
Undetectable presence, you've never seen the blood
Cause he comes in the form of what you think you love
I walk around with my own guilt
Draped over my shoulder like a long quilt
But I ain't sleeping in it, I'ma shed it gladly

Give y'all a history lesson man, history lesson
Peep the signs, read between the lines
Peep the signs, read between the lines
Let me teach y'all something man, feel this, listen

Knowledge you find inside my mind is designed to kill fear
Did you know the Bible was written in by William Shakespeare?
It was done in the King James version in his 46th year
The 46th Psalm is coded from the top down to the rear
Wanted his name over his work to be seen and read clear
But at the time that was something King James wasn't tryna hear
Study the history of King James, you'll find out he was a queer
I'll explain how Shakespeare did it, pay attention and listen clear
Go to the 46th Psalm, what I'm saying is not fake
Start at the word God, count 46 words down, you'll see 
shake
Then go to the bottom, you'll see the word 
refuge
 appear
Start right there, count 46 words up, you'll see 
spear
Shakespeare
, no coincidence they don't teach this in classes
They tampered with the holy scriptures and then fed it to the masses
Confused by misinterpreted signs and allegories
Parables are painted out like fairy tales and wild stories
That brainwashed the world, leaving theological masters
What was once the word of God is now a theatrical disaster
Words they gave us only serve to enslave us
Hurt us in murderous ways and got us out here hoping ghost worshipping save us
They don't want you black man, you think you know yourself don't you?
You got your last name, but that was the name of the slave-master that owned you
The same one who beat and hung ya and put you through this anguish
We in America not knowing our real names or real language
Learn the location and description of Jesus if you've never seen him
If you don't know the lines it's impossible for you to read inbetween them
Now are we so gone, there ain't no black pride and that’s real sad
Eminem can diss black women and we don't even get mad

Peep the signs, read between the lines
Time out for surface dwelling, time to elevate your mind, uh
Peep the signs, read between the lines
Time out for surface dwelling, time to elevate your mind

Lets cut to the chase and put the zodiac in it's place
Horoscopes and signs, pagan gods deceiving a race
Now when you claim that you a Virgo, are you sure that you are?
Do you worship the constellations or the one who created the star?
Take months of the year, September is the 9th month but I'm driven
To inform you that the root word 'Septo' means 7
So how did it get to be number 9? Somehow it don't equate
How can October be the 10th month when 'Octo' means 8
Like an octopus or octagon, 8 legs and 8 sides
Artificial names invented through mythological lies
All named after so called pagan gods in Heaven
See 'Nova' means 9 but November's month number 11
To the unfathomable abyss of knowledge I delve
D-E-C 'Deca' means 10 yet December's month number 12
See before you try and test me, I insist that you
Try to research and see that your calendars been misconstrued
See March was the 1st month, April used to be 2nd (listen)
May and June was 3 and 4 so now lets do some checking (listen)
See 2 months got removed, 
Quintilis
 and 
Sextilis
It's time to get this knowledge now before the effects kill us
Quint meaning 5, Sex meaning 6, it don't stop either
They added July and August named after Julius and Augustus Caesar
That's 5 and 6, September was 7, Octobers 8, November was 9
Now you see, it's all back in line
December's 10, January's 11th so go report this

Obstacles,The Maven,2013.0,"You can't say no weapon formed against you shall prosper
Then fold up when it get hard
Let's go after it

Life was pretty rough for a minute there
The status of your sanity was in the air
Almost impossible not to consume hate
When bad luck is living with you like a roommate
The clouds got dark and started rumbling
The rain from the outside was coming in
You're trying not to panic but that's the case
The water got higher, it was at your waist
It's hell now but I ain't got to tell you that
It's closing in on me, God where you at?
You're hurting for some bread, looking at your son
That lil' 9 to 5 just ain't getting it done
Your partner's make your weeks pay in half a day
Promise your baby mama not to get it that way
Life's circumstances make it kinda hard to trust
We always remember God is a part of us
 x2
We overcoming obstacles and letting blessings in
I heard somebody say success is the best revenge
If you utilise the talent that was put in you
You can master everything they said you couldn't do

See, all you wanna do is make the drama die
Your daddy never claimed you and your mama's high
It's hard to trust people, you afraid of help
With no parents around so you raised yourself
All your life people shooting slugs at you
Every time you take a step they knock you back two
Your house was like hell; years, days and months
Next door neighbours' living like the Brady Bunch
Wish you could've went to school and do something great
But sometimes you barely ate and couldn't concentrate
""You ain't nothing but a loser"" that's what people said
You ain't evil but you hustling for illegal bread
You resorted to the streets and started getting love
'Cus the thugs was the only folks who didn't judge
And even though you might have one or two stripes
Deep in your heart you know there's greater purpose for your life
 x2

You can't let your dreams shrivel up, or burst and die
Just because it didn't happen on the first try
Or the second, or the third, or the fourth time
Diamonds don't define greatness, let your heart shine
You keep running up on these locked doors
Accept God's version of a blessing not yours
We don't always know what's best so trust in him because
You don't even know yourself better than he does
Satan's cup is full of hate so let the evil drink
You too grown to worry about what other people think
Spiritual war try to make your higher conscious win
Even if the Devil do get a few punches in
And we can heal to the fullest soon
If we stop putting band-aids on bullet wounds
Addressing problems from the root'll make you sober quick
And watch how strong you get once it's over with

Mind Marathon,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Runners get on your marks, get set
And prepare to collapse, never recover
Shoutout to Rob Quest from the Coughee Brothaz
Now let us softly smother, let's go

Faces explode when I'm in rip mode
My abode is so distant that there's 700 digits in my zip code
I spit loads of toxins from the get-go, the fluids drip slow
One roundhouse produces 64 kick doors
In my relentless quest to be fast, as I beat ass
I wear a ski mask while telepathically punching a speed bag
I master any task that he has
Truthfully I'm as hard to grasp as a 10 below Alaskan heat rash
I'm typing chaos on the keypads
Two day electrocution delay for that fool who sat in my seat last
And tryna school me as I teach class, that feat's past impossible
Like one biologically having three dads
They knew I was special in elementary
'Cause any time that we played hide and seek I would hide in a different century
See, not even one tenth of me has empathy
That's why essentially a universal police infantry was sent for me
Just know that if you call me on my main line
I'll show you how to train minds to write 20 insane rhymes at the same time
Top ten ever, who's better? You couldn't name nine
You'll never see my decline like paraplegic gang signs
I'll throw a discus that passes through a list of my resistors
Yet still has enough force to spit an isthmus
You know I'm mad when I flash and start going agg
And run you over fast wearing boulder clad shoulder pads
My rest levels decreasing increasingly
My time is deleted so easily that I hire people to sleep for me
I'll tell you secrets that you better keep
I'll leave bite marks on concrete 'cause underneath my feet's another set of teeth
See I release and resist devils
When this level of intelligence settle I can mentally twist metal
Competitors I keep a taste for
To make war with a snake I'll jump a skateboard from off of the 98th floor
Between crazy and genius is a thin line
I pin rhymes standing perfectly balanced on 100% inclines
Marvel to witness, my blitzes were met with some resistance
I'm so different that I have to study myself from a distance
My eyes are used as portal pools
For oracles watching tomorrow's news 24 hours before it views
It'll take you 3 days to relay a complete page
My essays are pre-laid a decade before the beat's made
I go mad and harass over notepads
A slow drag wearing a Jokers mask even when the music goes fast
Flows are kinetic, moving like a motor's embedded
My writing process is solar driven, photosynthetic
One day I may even clone and replicate me
That way I can start the game and substitute myself in to replace me
The answer to you breathing is to cancel you
Transform into a frantic moose and look for panicked fools to run my antlers through
The panics understandable
I'm writing random dissertations with hands cuffed backwards, shackled in manacles
Flammable words said overpowered what the best read
Successfully embedded a human brain in an insect's head
As fast as the average thought once I'm grabbing for your heart
The end will be so quick that it will happen before the start
You can be travelling far riding in your car
I'll throw a set of endless bars that lodge into your temple hard like ninja stars
Through the wormhole my hand comes
A hundred years up to smack your great-grandson for throwing a tantrum
I'm presently located in Sector 3
Which means to get to me successfully you need a blessed MC directory
If you message me and don't receive a text from me
I'm probably somewhere recklessly performing a blindfolded appendectomy
The non-compliant flying rhyme scientist
My writings take flight and ignite microchips that purified the environment
The dime is spit in iron grip minds psychic psychiatrists
With 96 violent proprietors on my client list
A hot mic's the knife that I'm slicing with
A late night swipe to your windpipe is the price of his indecisiveness
The eye witness was fire lit twice for this
I'll visit you in the night and teach you how you might exist conscious through lifelessness
Stifling viper licks strike your wrists and look like tiger slits
Every writer that spits in this cypher's hit with psoriasis
Smash your clown and leave your whole class astounded
As the drink I'm downing has the form of container with no glass around it
Once I've done it no man will recover from it
Respondents found with subatomic mini bombs that I pumped into the brother's stomach
So now the verse demand heightens
Each night I wrote a sheet and every word was in a different person's handwriting
I flame streets, people love to watch me shank beats
Before they read your words, they'd rather stare at my blank sheets",https://genius.com/K-rino-mind-marathon-lyrics

I'd just rather not kick it, man
Take me for who I am
In the words of Dolemite
""If you don't, confidentially I don't give a damn""
See, everybody think they gotta try to portray an image
But this how it really go

Watch your boy, here I come rolling down the avenue
Not in a Bentley or a Phantom, just a Malibu
Sorry if you met me and you thought I have a slab or two
I'm living in the hood, I got one crib and that'll do
Grinding every day but I ain't sitting on seven figures
I'm not a gangster murderer who shot up twenty niggas
I don't lie about my lifestyle, I do me and I get love
And I never made it rain 20 G's inside a strip club
No diamonds on my fingers or my neck 'cause I don't sport 'em
1 Because it ain't my style and 2 I can't afford 'em
If you can, do your thing boy, go hard up in the paint
I don't knock you if that's you, but I do knock you if it ain't
Yeah I'm still making records, travelling, knocking these shows off
And backstage ain't no groupies dare ripping my clothes off
I'm not a powderhead, bragging 'bout sniffing  my nose off
And I wasn't sipping drink, I was just sleeping so I dozed off

I'm not balling out of control, I never made it rain
My Twitter's not blowing up, I'm still on the chain
I just laugh when these rappers be lying 'bout what they got
'Cause everything these suckers claim they are I promise you they're not

The spots that I be going to ain't got no red carpet
My car's right next to yours, the valet didn't park it
My wardrobe is simple, no one cares how much it costed
This shirt was $9.99 at King's flea market
I'm not in VIP I'm in the main club with ya
And when I left, no paparazzi was taking pictures
I'm not a mob boss, a kingpin moving weight
And I ain't never ran a car load of bricks across the state
I just walked in, pulled out a wad of money and it was on
""What you do?"" Paid my cable license, phone and went back home
Yeah I might fly to a show, hit the stage and rock the livest set
But coach seats, no first class, no private jet
No worldwide street team, like some of these liars
I paid a crackhead $10 to pass out my flyers
My single ain't on fire, I barely got a buzz
No millions in the bank, but on that note I wish it was

I'm not balling out of control, I never made it rain
My Twitter's not blowing up, I'm still on the chain
I just laugh when these rappers be lying 'bout what they got
'Cause everything these suckers claim they are I promise you they're not

Ain't no lake behind my house where we swim and go fishing
I don't live in the mansion with four or five kitchens
The women don't scream when they see me like Justin Bieber
And I never dated a star or supermodel either
I don't do drivebys and I'm not sowing the game up
I never made a sex tape to try to blow my name up
The flash and that industry hype, I'm not pursuing that
And wrecking all them rappers.. hold up, wait... I do be doing that
Why you bragging on the image that you never could prove?
I ain't fronting like these fools, I'm just a regular dude
Ain't no entourage around me fronting and acting hard
When I show up at the door it's just me and the good Lord
No million dollar video shoot, no glitz, no glamour
My partner did it free with a handheld HD camera
And I never won a Grammy and my album went wood
But I got a ghetto plaque for showing love to every hood

I'm not balling out of control, I never made it rain
My Twitter's not blowing up, I'm still on the chain
I just laugh when these rappers be lying 'bout what they got
'Cause everything these suckers claim they are I promise you they're not

I can't believe y'all be believing these dudes, man
I been seeing these cats rap about Maybach's
And then roll up in a Toyota Corolla
Fool your favorite rapper work at Taco Cabana or somewhere, man
Keep it real, just be who you are, man

Abortion Song,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"I know you was worried, I know you was scared
Put yourself in a tough spot, totally unprepared
You trusted his words, trusted every lie that he spoke
Never thought that he would fake out and the ties would be broke
Made the connection, afraid that you would lose his affection
The words, ‘I love you’ was used a tool to deception
So you dove in head first without the use of digression
Now depression got you moving in a useless direction
When you found out you was pregnant, the panic took over
Especially when you told him, he acted like he didn’t know you
Now the lowest you could ever feel, you five levels below it
15 with a child coming and your parents don’t know it
Started stressing about the outcome and the possible shame
So you confided in a classmate who’d been through the same
You wasn’t thinking clear, walking around in obvious fear
Gave you a number to replace and make your child disappear

What am I supposed to do, it's not supposed to be this way
Your blood comes from my veins, baby
My mind is going crazy,  I don't know if I can take this
Lord help me as I'm praying before I make a decision

You aborted your baby though you didn't wanna do that
You lost a part of yourself that you can never get back
Who can understand your mental pain, nobody but you
Not to mention the physical trauma your body went through
Nobody even know you did it to ask if you was all right
Forced to be strong and carry on with your everyday life
Now you regretting that decision feeling it wasn't right
Started having bad dreams, barely sleeping at night
You did it 'cause you feared what folks would say when it was discovered
You were embarrassed at the thought about being a teenage mother
Plus your parents warned you about breaking them rules
What would they say when their little girl gave them that news
If you kept your baby you would have had to drop out of school
To put your heart into the hands of a fool
When you finally let him know he chalked it up as a win
The responsibility gone, now he calling again

What am I supposed to do, it's not supposed to be this way
Your blood comes from my veins, baby

What if we could?
What if we could on our own?
And what if we didn't have a choice?

A picture captures a moment, the song speaks to the soul
A prayer strengthens the spirit, the world seeks to control
The mind triggers an action, your life's part of the whole
The eyes can tell a story that the mouth has never told

Here I stand, a full grown man
Assessing my future plans from the point where I am
My memory opens up and then it starts to expand
And aspects of life began to be reran
Normally I'm moving fast, no thoughts that'll past keep
Now things from childhood are more vivid than last week
Recollections from my foreign immediately past creep
Feelin partially sedated or should I say half sleep?
Had to sit down and think, what's happenin in my mind?
How come my brain is now just recapturin the times
I can see my whole history in flashes of my prime
Clear visions of my existence are graphically defined
Nothing blurry or cloudy, they definitively come
Instead of tapering off they continually run
Across my timeline diametrically directed
Manifesting quicker than my aptitude to process it

A picture captures a moment, the song speaks to the soul
A prayer strengthens the spirit, the world seeks to control
The mind triggers an action, your life's part of the whole
The eyes can tell a story that the mouth has never told

I can feel myself goin back (Goin back)
I can feel myself goin back (Goin back)
I seen it all and done it all without knowin that
When the trouble winds blow at me I'm blowin back
How can all these thoughts navigate this fast indeed
24 billion miles per second is the average speed
I'm still alive, I ain't dyin, don't confuse the game
Life ain't flashin before my eyes, it's travelin through my brain
Buildin up my character to face a better foe
Preparing me for somethin bigger than I'd ever know
Some of my points of stress have not been honestly addressed
Can't be my best with dark moments subconsciously suppressed
A total sum of me is what I made it become
All categories of life inside a day that it's won (All of em)
You have to make your life, do it, not do what it makes you
You have to take the world over before it overtakes you

A picture captures a moment, the song speaks to the soul
A prayer strengthens the spirit, the world seeks to control
The mind triggers an action, your life's part of the whole
The eyes can tell a story that the mouth has never told

The cause, will soon materialize shortly
A couple of hours of thought took 5 years off me
Lights strikes in my eyes, I'm instantly energized
Within a matter of minutes I looked and I'm 25
I smile when I arrive, celebrated all the way there
When I reached 22, I was wishin I could stay there
But I kept goin backwards, lookin younger in the mirror
Every stage that I entered played music from the era
It was beautiful as ever, I was youthful, I was clever
Didn't want to move from it cause I knew that it was better
I slipped to my teen years, now whether spoken or not
I feel that I'm goin too far back, hopin it stops
Middle school, elementary school, no longer older
Now I can't talk, I can't even walk, I'm in a stroller
Then back to the day of birth, somehow I remember though
Back into the belly, changin from fetus to embryo
Then a sperm cell exitin the egg and reverse
Then out of the memory of both parents I disperse
Then I heard a voice say how ungrateful that I had been
And said ""When you appreciate life I'll send you back again""

The Me You Don’t See,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"(*talking*)
Hey, come into my house for a second
What house, yeah my real house listen to your boy

I been to' down by the world, now it's time to rebuild
I'm real enough to call you fake, and you too fake to tell me that I'm real
Out of your two sides, which one will we know
The real side behind closed doors, or the one that you show
When I'm alone I talk to myself, that's strange to you
I think we all do, you crazy if you don't in my view
Showing as much of my game face, the world can consume
But how do I carry myself, when it's just me in a room
Don't get me wrong, I thank the good Lord for blessing my stillness
Like ignorance, seems to get more blessings than realness
Positivity I condone, but still I'm prone to do evil
Have you ever felt alone, inside a room full of people
If we could read minds for a day, and hear what folks ain't speaking
You might be shocked, if you knew what some of these people were thinking
About you yeah you, I know that I'm being felt
You can tell them lies to me, but you can't lie to yourself

The side of me, that you don't see
That shows the pain, and the misery
That I'm going through, but never showing you
But when I'm all alone, this is what I do

My bad side I'm guilty, you're barely checking that
I dream that I shed tears, the second that God read me my record back
I activate thoughts, and sharpen my wits
The deeper you go inside my heart, the darker it gets
I rarely speak about my street wars, the things that I've done
The youngster that tried to kill me, in 2001
Or was it 2002, I can't remember myself
I can't forget where I came from, cause I never left
Now if I wanna stack, I gotta bring my serious mind back
I put nothing past nobody, and it's a period behind that
I been the villain and the victim, but my love is blind black
If you ain't sure you heard me right, then rewind that line back
I take the bad with the good, cause they feed eachother
I might be tripping, but it's kinda like they need eachother
Because without good, the bad wouldn't be seen and such
And without the bad, the good might not mean as much


The me you don't see, the side that tends to play men
The side the day he asked God, to forgive him for the same sin
The side of me that's scared to fail, and won't face the ill winds
That occasionally doubts, the existence of real friends
The real me, not the M.C. that brag and boast
The man who underappreciates women, he loves the most
The side of me that wanna give up, but'll never admit it
Who know the move I pulled was out of line, but still went and did it
I'm trying to gather good intentions, and abolish what's left
The man that's sitting inside the hoe house, with not of his self
Do I think it's fair I make music, that not many jam
Or hourly say I ain't tripping, but inside I really am
Women come and go, relationships was never what they could be
Some loved me, but I don't think none of em understood me
Cause if they did, we'd still be together possibly
But I can't cry about it, cause whatever happened was meant to be yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-me-you-dont-see-lyrics
The Meeting,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"I woke before the daylight, waited for the Sun to rise
Checked my mailbox and opened up an envelope that said I'd won a prize
I thought at first it was a scam and it could be corrupt
But then I started thinking, ""Well I'm free today, let's see what's up""
Went down to claim it at a remote building with tinted glass
Walked inside, the place was empty, two or three minutes passed
The secretary came, a side door she entered from
Led me to an office where a man spoke through an intercom
He said, ""I'm glad I got you here, this won't take long believe me
Intelligent as you are I didn't think it would be this easy
Now what I'm offering will place the world at your disposal
Your life will be much greater if you accept this proposal""

Rulers of the dark side trying to meet with me
Offering a false dream thinking they'll get me
Watching my life tryna take mine from me
Thinking I'll trade my soul for the money
What you tell em K? No no no no noooo
What was your answer? No no no no noooo

""Where do you know me from? Who are you?"" He said, ""Stop and listen""
""Listen to what? Cause I'm not interested in propositions""
""The things you talk about in your music enlightens minds
We know what you stand for, we been watching you for quite some time
Bottom line you need to join that's why you have the chance
Cause what you represent goes against our master plans""
I said, ""You asking me to poison minds? Don't even bother""
He said, ""You might reconsider once you see what I can offer""
He showed me visions of cars, women and counting gwop
I thought of Jesus and the Devil on the mountain top
He told me, ""We'll protect you deep while you fishing for sheet
Denounce the ideologies you speak, you'll be rich in a week""


I said, ""If you waiting for my soul don't hold your breath
Why you gotta hide behind that wall, coward show yourself""
He said, ""You can't see me 'cause if we ask and you say no
After seeing who I am there's no way we can let you go""
I asked him, ""Why you wanna keep the people fooled and blind?""
He said, ""'Cause if they wake up we'll no longer rule their minds
So we block the light and make sure their not handed sight
'Cause we rule entertainment, schools, religion"" I said, ""Damn, he's right""
""And even though you might be one of few who know the facts
Everything you read hear or see, guess who's controlling that?
Wouldn't you like to be on radio, TV and stand above
We'll even give you honorary membership into our club""
""So basically your actually showing the nerve to
Ask of me to use the gift Allah gave me to serve you
Dude you sick as bird flu, you can put those thoughts to rest
'Cause me saving my people is bigger than any false success""
It's hard to rest in the presence of this evilness
I was shocked when he showed me pictures of people he possessed
I said, ""I'll never bow so just make K-Rino a martyr
This meeting made me smarter, now at you I'm going harder""",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-meeting-lyrics
Flow Session Number 5,The Maven,2013.0,"Flow Session Number 5
5, 5, 5, see

Your first mistake was coming into my flow zone
You got it wrong like skinny dipping with clothes on
Any time I get the chance to spit non stop
I'm happy as a crackhead alone inside a pawn shop
You got a whole lot of songs and some silly bars
They like your children, you claim 'em but they ain't really yours
Before you even rehab, I'll make you relapse
And dope slap your Adam's apple down into your kneecaps
Wreckin' the game, I'm that vein in your neck lancer
Disrespect, you getting checked like a correct dancer
Close my eyes and grew three times the size of you
I'm so surprisingly wise even my lies are true
Wanna be down, guess how many flows you gotta spit?
Like toilet paper, I'ma put you through a lotta quit
K-Rino getting murked by your kinda flow
You never see it like a Rolex at a dollar store
A lot of dough in my pocket plus the urge to spend it
Hands behind my back writing 87 words a minute
My wordplay inside your brain, it won't work, I'm sorry
That's like a X-Box game inside the first Atari
How many battles did I lose? I'll be the first to laugh
That's like asking how many sides does a circle have
I go Fed 'cause I'm tryna make some real bread
With no meds, I get it popping like a pillhead
To make a move to knock K-Rino from the top
Is dumb like tryna use a Kleenex to block a gunshot
My tongue's a knife, so look out for your spleen
'Cause I'ma make a cut like I tried out for the team, fool
You do the same routine, ain't no best parts
I hate looking at it like their girlfriend's stretch marks
My raw essence impeccable, way past average
That's why my battles end faster than a bad marriage
I'm a miracle child, that's what they told my mother
I'm a year and a half older than my older brother
Such a problem in the game, they kept me left out
A scared rapper hired me to take myself out
Somebody said I was an artificial MC
They got their information R-O-N-G
My neighborhood ain't a place you wanna visit often
You 35, buying jeans from the kids department
It'll be a cold day in Hell when I fail
I stand behind these bars like I was in a cell
No mirrors in my house, I don't wanna face myself
I'm messing the game up like a replacement ref
At the top of the list is where my head ranks
I'm so great I slapped a rapper and he said, ""Thanks""
You wanna work with me, cool I won't be long with ya
Commit suicide, then I'll make a song with ya
I set a trap because you thought you was deceiving K
He took the bait like Skip Bayless and Stephen A
Needless to say, I don't play the way these dudes play
My show's be packed like Popeyes on Tuesday
No conversation, no fake threats, just simply boom
I get standing ovations inside an empty room
How you got matched up with me I don't know how at all
That ain't fair like Oprah winning the Powerball
You said I'd never be the greatest with a pen, G
Can't say the word never without having envy
Lied and said you had a deal, wanted congratulations
That ain't no contract, that's a Kroger application
You say you ballin' like LeBron now I'm smiling
'Cause you gots no rings like a phone on silent
Or even vibrate with 25 folks dialing
And I wouldn't touch your girl if we were stranded on an island
Why am I great? 'Cause I practice and study the game
Said he wanted his mind read, so I bloodied his brain
No time for these cowards
It's not enough hours in a day, so I squeeze days into an hour
My life's scripture, I reveal it then go backwards with ya
Old on my before, shot a baby on my after picture
I'm too intelligent, I'll mash you into gelatin
You'll never be tight like spandex on a skeleton
I got 'em scared when I show up they gon' run or beg
Rappers split faster than skinny jeans on your mama's leg
I'm acapella killing after the track
Against me you have no wind like an asthma attack
They complain 'cause my flow murders are kept on tape
Every line I made 'em whine like stepped on grapes
Most artists say that they're great but they don't want no part of K
No I'm not Tim, but I'm fiending to take your heart away
Let's go to war today, I'ma have you hell bound
I'm not alone, I got back up like I fell down
Not to be arrogant but this ain't no comparison
Record labels don't wanna sign us like Claritin
I'm so emphatically talented it's embarrassing
And with these punchlines I'm the man son like Marilyn
Stop my grind? Boy, you out of your mind
I'm getting my weight up like I left somebody behind
I don't started up but I never run from any drama
Burn your arm with a hot iron like Penny's mama
I'ma come through when it's crunch time with clever flows
You like a 24 hour store, you never close
The deal, you don't write because you a biting faker
You don't have no lines, you like typing paper
If you diss me and start tellin' them strong lies
(What?) You better take it back like it's the wrong size
Rappers hate when they hear my album finna drop
I'm bussing every day like my car was in the shop
Stop lying on the mic about your perfect sound
Everything you say is made up like a circus clown",https://genius.com/K-rino-flow-session-number-5-lyrics
Speech Unleashed,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, for years you've heard of the supreme lyrical entity that has roamed the Earth leaving a path of verbal destruction in the aftermath
Well tonight you will see him live on this very stage
But I have to warn you, he's not here because he wants to be
We've captured him and brought him here so that we can witness his displays of word mastery with our own eyes
He's very angry, so we've placed a protective barrier between the stage and your seats in hope that no one will be harmed
Despite these efforts, we urge you to be very careful because we don't know what he's capable of
So without further ado...
Oh no, he's got loose!

You need to know my flows hit you like real stout blows
I'll punch a calendar and knock a month out cold
Your image as a whole I'll quickly denounce, I'll clown and sweep through each bounce
You'll need a 7 digit scoreboard to keep count
It's true no one can do it like I do
Drive by at a 100 miles an hour in a ride and high five you
And crack you 'cause you thought you was hot
The mystic warlock who could snatch a keyhole from off of a lock
When I blatantly concentrate you couldn't whip me with a Tec
I'm an animal plus I'm sick, somebody take me to the vet
Right after I spoke a note, these jokers openly repost
I speak multiple vocals, the locals think I've got three throats
My pen and pad goes in agg mode
Before I open up my folder I type a million character passcode
Then I sip Habanero Tabasco, my past flows are so well composed
They're known to make lightning flash slow
And it's apropos to cause fiascos
I laugh knowing I hold loads of nuclear weapons under my bathrobes
I set fire to mics and drive slow
We can travel the Glasgow as long as I let my mom and my dad know
Water I'm breathing under, come do you believe in wonders?
Why? 'Cause I'm the one who invented an odd even number
I just had to assassinate you for standing and laughing
I'll savagely decapitate you then hand you an aspirin
Defeat my team, yeah I see you homie, at least you're dreaming
I'm a beast, they doused me in hot grease and the grease was screaming
Your people feinding for concepts with a deeper meaning
My line scheme got 'em seeing secretly reconvening
High frequency thinking, cerebrally linking each who syncing
Unequalled achievements, bilingually speaking street and English
The deepness of it couldn't be corrupted
Shuffle up the words inside a book I never read and watch me reconstruct it
This new breed could never consume me
If I get mad I won't storm out the room, I'll make the room leave
Bars without a limit, no measure to the total that's been expended
The doctor told me my throat canal had an engine in it
And since you think your skills are so hot I'll roast you on the spot
And take what's left back home in a to-go box
See I'm that guy who you should leave alone
I'll sneak in your deepest cerebral zone and play your secrets on speaker phone
It's true I'm forming a new mind
So many multiples and group rhymes you'll find a whole 16 inside 2 lines
I told ya I'm a fully loaded bazooka holder
Blow off ya shoulders, you won't have nothing to look over
No escaping tonight, I'll go make a device
That will seek and verify your location precise
Snatch up a life, every member of your house gets tortured
The missing poster will look just like a family portrait
When I go to bed, sweet phrases develop in my sleep
And when I wake up complete pages are all over the sheets
I come with ripping intentions, spit with different equipment
I was given infinite mental dimensions as an infant
When I architect, each part is hectic
So infectious that a sleep narcoleptic would restart the record
For trickery I snatch you wickedly and hit you so horrifically
It split you into 63 different ethnicities
While I walk now with great wisdom endowed
Standing crowds, speaking silently and listening loud
Who can be as electrifying as me?
Vision a top MC of the highest degree and multiply him by 3
It's not known my bodies made of solid stone
So my collarbone got a lot of hydraulics to carry all the knowledge on
Down to the subject, you a clown and a puppet
I accomplish more than you when I'm being counterproductive
My sound is destructive, no outlet in the town can disrupt it
Underground yet oceanic, so you drown if you touch it
A mountain of grudges from old beefs found in my clutches
Expound and you love it, my head's big, the crown is above it
My treacherous message pops ya like a pressure washer
I'll mop ya then disrespect your partner, chop and botch you like a reckless doctor
I'm seeing bloodbath signs, we'll play a game where we draft lines
And it takes 9 months to get to half time

Ha
And then there was one
Only one
Only one",https://genius.com/K-rino-speech-unleashed-lyrics
Makin’ Enemies,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"[Intro: K-Rino
Hmm hmm, yeah yeah yeah
Listen, might as well start off right

You've got plex for me, better address it directly
Best believe, if not never will it affect me
I possess every heavenly preliminary accessory
Necessary to carry out my destiny
Recipes for your death, I read
With a decree accompanied by a press release
Many of these freaks, women in pools
Are weak feminine attributes used in schools
To teach women as the orchestrators of the new genocidal assimilate
Temperate imminent killin buildin coffins for citizens
Generational remnants eliminated from mental remembrance
Body excrement present under his Timberlands
You pledge allegiance, to a Devil beasting
Forever seek weak levels of peace, never eastin'
Meanwhile, the people are deceivin' to believe in
Every citizens part of the sake American dream
When the fact of the matter is that they lack love
For the people who this country was built on the backs of
The brown and black blood, thats found in that mud
Was inundating the hood prior to the crack flood
Nobody willin' to listen that's why we still in the system
Greedy imperial visions consistent buildin' up prisons
""See that's a mistake man, don't you know Americas a great land
Nobody offers you freedom like they can""
""Wait man are we talkin' bout the same great man
Who murdered the Indians made the Africans slaves and
Persecuted the planet soon as he left the cave and
Let his hate span, fool, get outta my face, man""
Police academy puttin bullets in our anatomy
Savage brutalities while they laughing, cashing their salary
A different tragedy, Sunday through Saturday
As fast as we rally another's happening scary passive and maddening??
See but I gotta be who I gotta be
Y'all asleep in an odyssey of hallucinogenic Christian theology
Obviously concocted in privacy
Cause a lot of these lying scholars be subscribing to rotten policies
I'm not a doctor of meteorology nor do I try to be
But I can see God dropping his weather constantly
He been loading, fire and then slow
Eventually ending his foes with a crescendo
Got water coming down, how much higher can the rain get?
Brace for the great earthquake that haven't came yet
I drop fire till I make the preacher retire
Your life is trifling and your priest is a liar
Now the suckers on the run, had to rush him with a gun
Cause he caught him in the church house touching on his son
You capping on tape, every song you happen to make
That's a mistake, 88% of rappers are fake
Weapon in fast for definite cash dressing in drag
And you helping the sad moment by accepting this trash
Weapon of discrepancy over the Confederate flag
But whenever cops weapons blast you never get mad
Y'all holding hands you don't want drama in the place
Praying for the same man who shot ya mama in the face
Can't relate with em or have the grace to debate with em
Cause when truth hit em in the face they say it's racism
They hate when you regulate and break in their fake system
But they can't even get an education if they listen
International kick doors, all of their sick wars
But black history? ""That's old, You should forget yours
Quit looking at old grass and put it in the past
Meanwhile, here's a foot nigga put it in your ass""
Remember the Holocaust, the Alamo
Remember the main Pearl Harbor and every battle yo
People done fought but our struggle never matters though
It's sad to know, that the black average Joe would rather go with the status quo
Unknowingly we been involved in saint synagogue
In the dark, United States is a mental ward
They come in and rob pretending they met a God
Then they start selling resources, pillaging any part
Of the planet and enemies are contested, arrested
The media only gives domestic perspective
Trust indeed raise up the corners and see
But they the terrorists they accuse others to be
From Hiroshima to Desert Storm to Black Wall Street
And my balls are black that's why they blackball me",https://genius.com/K-rino-makin-enemies-lyrics
House of the Enemy,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Each day, these demons increase hate
Your freedom is replaced with racist police states
This countries a lit fuse, unfixable issues
They playing by sick rules, authority misused
Preparing for something, weak women and punk men
The law mans killing your friend, quit filming and jump in
See that's why the heat's hot, because unified, we're not
Got 50 people scared to save their partner from 3 cops
It's like we got no shot, bow down to them, hope not
It's part of a slow plot to control us like robots
And leave you unconscious and feed you that nonsense
To keep you mentally preoccupied with that dumb shit
Like who's the best dressed mates, which star got the best place
Which rapper and his girlfriend just dropped a new sex tape
But one day your brain will blow and straight up insane you'll go
The day they came to know that true reality ain't a show

You're living in the House of the enemy, murder, no sympathy
Mind manipulation, mischannelling your energy
Peace can't happen separation is the remedy
You're living in Satan's house thinking that the rent is free
House of the enemy, murder, no sympathy
Fear of the slave whip lodged in your memory
God's about to bring down this entire industry
Living in Satan's house thinking that the rent is free

If your little gun's able to actually save you
See they let have those but you don't got the ones they do
It's bad cause you don't know and won't till your dome blow
You're bragging about your pistol when these devils got drones bro
They passed passed a new law where they can run in your residence
And apprehend you with no probable cause or no evidence
Slowly sewing your town up, don't care if you're frowned up
And as we speak they're setting up camps for the round-up
No chance when it's time to go, I promise it's coming bro
And now you're in the new United States of Guantanimo
The signs are openly being shown gotta notice these
Slowly American streets are looking like overseas
Locally the police are trained like the soldiers be
Exploding heat and won't stop until they make your ghost release
Innocent people are jeopardized when there's weapon rised
Devils got the best disguise so you can't recognize them with your naked eyes


In this Hell zone, there's no one to tell on
You voluntarily place everything in your cell phone
Internet fiends jack, your actions they scream black
So when you posted pictures of your drugs, they seen that
They know what you're thinking like, they know what excites you
They study what you type then they project what you might do
Night, morning and afternoon, folks dying from battle wounds
And screaming that you know your rights that shit ain't gon' matter soon
Don't care if you're dropping facts, kill that, better watch your back
They'll snatch you up and nobody gonna know where they got you at
And soon they'll be proving it, they're hiding a slew of shit
A shadow government and every president knew of it
From Jefferson to Roosevelt to Wilson to Kennedy
Said America was governed by invisible entities
Who seek to use us as pawns, it's bigger than busting guns

The World,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"I feel like life's walls are closing in on me
This world put its spin on me, I got a 2 tons jacket of sin on me
No hope, just doubt, a race to get out, nothing to joke about
We're living in the actual time that the prophets spoke about
My view on life in my perspective is that when things are hectic
God is not the first option selected nor the second
Got a million drugs to stop the pain with and Satan came with awkward language
Now we shocked and anguished hoping that Barack could change it
My tainted mind is dizzy and now it seems like every time
I need a sign where is he, called God but his line was busy
We're in and out of prison, tryna make our living
In an unforgiving system that's money and power driven
The condition seems immutable, a plethora of wakes and funerals
The frequency of a youth's mind is untuneable
And truth and falsehoods never coincided, just collided
How can the Devil save your home when its own house is divided

The world is coming to an end
And it's never coming back again
God is your only friend
Without him you can never win

How can I pledge allegiance with wretched thieves and deviants
When all my people ever received was deep grieving and deadly disagreements
Strategic deceiving, now you expect me to stand and believe in
An anthem Francis Scott Key penned back in 1814 when
Black people were being held in bondage, ways of despicable disgust
So those words were not applicable to us
You got the Hell beat out ya, right after you served and fought war
So why you facing the flag with your hand pressed against your heart for
Don't be misled, see the red represents oceans of bloodshed
From the millions they murdered and left dead
With no sympathy or leniency
The second color up in that flag represents the wicked premise of white supremacy
We live under a sick direction
Just like the sky falsely appears to the eye, the color blue, represents deception
So now's the time for resurrection
If you can't see America falling right in front of you then you need a eye inspection

The world is coming to an end
And it's never coming back again
God is your only friend
Without him you can never win

Tell me how we gonna survive the day if you won't eat
$10 worth of gas won't get you out the gas station driveway
The words that Satan spoke were fraud
Instead of tryna choose between republicans and democrats, we need to vote for God
And ride for Him exclusively
I understand now what my elders meant when they say, ""Things ain't how they used to be""
We cried until our eyes were red
The crazy part is that how bad it is now ain't even worst than what lies ahead
God lifted His hand and summoned pestilence in the land of slum and
No respect between man and woman, storms, earthquakes and famine coming
People suffering and grieving a lot, wicked shepherds deceiving the flock
Receiving the shock of the hour is hot but believe it or not it's the key to the lock
See the state the economy in, soon the food supply gonna be thin
Honestly men are out here tryna be women now when women wanna be men
Child molesting and prostitution, multiple drug use and water pollution
Educational system losing, watch the news, it's mass confusion

The world is coming to an end
And it's never coming back again
God is your only friend
Without him you can never win",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-world-lyrics
The Sorceror’s Den,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"One night I was restless, slingin' to sanity like a barnacle
I walked a couple miles and then stumbled upon a carnival
Unlike anything I'd ever seen it was phenomenal
Whatever the mind could imagine was right in front of you
One of the attractions was calling me to see within the man stood at the doorway luring the people in
His booth looked real tiny and inoperable
But infinitely large on the inside like Doctor Who
He said ""I'm owner of this wonderful establishment
Please sign the waiver before you enter the labyrinth
Brace yourself mentally cause you're about to witness the most incredible acts of sorcery in existence""
I ran to the booth, ""Do you expect me to believe this?""
I quickly bought a ticket while thinking I gotta see this
He closed the door behind us then sat us all on a chair
The door slammed but when I looked back it was no longer there

Step forward towards the front door and come in
You have now just entered in the sorcerer's den
This is a voluntary thing nobody's forcing you in
But if you go you may never see your porches again
Step forward towards the front door and come in
You have now just entered in the sorcerer's den
This is a voluntary thing nobody's forcing you in
But if you go you may never see your porches again

Now the second after all of the consent forms were signed
He started warming up by moving objects with his mind
He was blindin' us with magic now our vision was impaired
He was changing forms and all of the children were getting scared
He just laughed and continued to carry out more deeds
I said ""Sir we've seen enough, can you open the door please?""
He said ""I haven't put my whole repertoire on display
I'll release you when I get ready, follow me this way""
""Goodness gracious what have I got myself into?
Who are you, what are you, where are you from, who sent you?""
He said ""I am the sorcerer I'll never let'chu go
But I'll brief you with my true histories since you like to know
I'm from a family of oracle I'm fifth generation
I frequently listen to apparition conversations
I'm skilled in levitation and spirit communication
But my specialty is deconstructing dream interpretation.""
""OK then but to use it like, this is not intelligent.""
He said ""I'm testing mortal minds as an experiment
And right now, there's nobody comparable to my skill
So who could ever challenge me?"" I smiled and said ""I will.""

Step forward towards the front door and come in
You have now just entered in the sorcerer's den
This is a voluntary thing nobody's forcing you in
But if you go you may never see your porches again
Step forward towards the front door and come in
You have now just entered in the sorcerer's den
This is a voluntary thing nobody's forcing you in
But if you go you may never see your porches again

He kinda laughed saying ""This must be a joke
Line up with the others cause my wrath is easily provoked.""
I said, ""No it's not a joke"" He said, ""Well if this is true
Won't you give a demonstration on the things that you could do.""
I said ""Well, I noticed how you metamorphosize
I had mastered the ability to morph when I was five
I can demonstrate advance transformation overdrive
And explain the process afterwards that's if you're still alive
You talk about your family I have no bloodline
I spun out of the sun I'm the only of my kind.""
I spoke a million words in a seven second span
He wondered why he couldn't talk back; his mouth was in my hand
I dangled it in front of him, just to see his face
Then made it evaporate and land in its proper place
I made him face a mirror his reflection was cast
Then I shattered his anatomy like it was the glass
Turned the mirror into blood, wiped it up with a rag
Put his pieces in a box and put the box in a bag
The people cheered, ""You must be the Wizard!"" I said, ""Indeed.""
""Can we leave?"" I said, ""No, because you now belong to me.""",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-sorcerors-den-lyrics
Solitary Confinement,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"""K-Rino, you'll be held in solitary confinement until further notice""

Minutes after I received my sentence
I was then sent to the threshold of a corridor's entrance
Forced into an hellish existence, I went from intense pain
Then commenced to seek instant repentance
My hand served as a surveyor, with no light I'm sightless
I stand beneath darkness' third layer
Imprisoned as a punishment, now receiving a fate
In a place so desolate prayers can't even escape
The reason I was here was never communicated clear
Two minutes in this place appeared like I had waited years
When the lights came on I was bathing in bladed tears
'Cause the room had commandeered all of my greatest fears
This ain't Hades 'cause it ain't hot and I don't see devils
I saw three different escalators that lead to three levels
I stepped on the first one making sure to be careful
Saw fluid filled lines on the walls that looked like blood vessels
That first floor was called Confessional
For 24 hours straight they questioned and pressured you to express the truth
Everything I did, every evil act was tracked on a sheet of black
Stone I had to reenact then read it back
Painfully I suffered as I heard people applaud
I saw every face of every individual that I scarred
Childhood to teenage to adult years
Each women that ever shed tears over me vindictively appeared
Who I hurt bad despite them loving me
And left them to suffer without the slightest concern for their recovery
I looked at all the people I dissed, begged or tortured to cease and desist
Couldn't leave, they had shackled my feet and my wrist
Then I was given a proposition
To go to the next level or stay in this condition
My selection was to move on not realizing
That the second level was twice as painful and traumatizing
From the moment I put one foot on the next floor
I became sick to my stomach, disgusted by what I saw
People who needed me in life that I chose to ignore
Stood before me with intentions to even up the score
One of them said, ""Do you remember me?
I'm the homeless man that you didn't feed, you passed right by me in my time of need
Said ""Please"" but ended up receiving no love
You was leaving the club, judged me and accused me of being on drugs
But you didn't know that I was a celestial
Angel on the Earthly quest to morally test you
You left and the thought never revisited or stressed you
That one great gesture without question would of blessed you
So now you'll feel the pain of those you never said yes to
For seven years straight like they did with no rescue
The horror in the field without letter will infest you
The cycle will repeat itself eternally unless you
Decide to go to the final stage
But its your last one, after this there's no turning the page""
I said, ""Let's go"" with no idea where I would be sent
Knowing this was it, back to the escalator I went
The last and worst floor was deep as the Earth's core
I was more nervous than the first whore to walk inside a Church door
I was instructed to sit by a wall with two slits
Approximately one inch in length, one inch in width
When they opened up somebody said, ""Look inside""
I was so petrified I asked if I could decline, it said ""Denied""
Chance to survive was put in doubt
I passively looked in and realized that I was really looking out
I saw trees, sunlight and I rose up
Soon as a glimmer of hope exposed itself, the slits closed up
Once again I became mindful of my situation
The same voice said look behind you
And when I did it was such a burden
To see every person from the first two levels on the third one
I knew then I messed up and should of chose better
Instead of one of the time I had to face it all together
""How long will I be in this place? Please tell me""
Claustrophobic in a small cell where they held me
A voice said, ""Just think and rewind
The whole time you was subconsciously confined in the guilt of your own mind
And these two slits are your eyes
So understand if you continue to persecute, these thoughts will stay in you
But something had to teach you
We had no authority over your brain, you contain the power to release you""",https://genius.com/K-rino-solitary-confinement-lyrics
Holla At Me,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"Look mayne
I know I ain't telling you nothing you don't already know
Sometimes it's good just at the same thing just to get it in ya brain
Pick yourself up
Get back on ya notes ya feel me
Come on

Don't let nobody undermine you
Just grind and remain on the post you was assigned too
Don't let money and cars blind you
Just take the time to look inside in yourself and find you
Whatever you was is now history
Whatever you are is not greater then what you will be
I'm talking to you, you listening to me?
Your activity is the key not just wishing to be
Why believe when you can know, why hope when you can pray?
Why quit when you can win, why leave when you can stay?
If you wanna put the weed or the drink or the crack down
Fight it like a soldier don't back down
Mind to yourself just habit was given
How can an inanimate object rule something that's living?
Every minute of the day we got our minds thinking of you
We all got sin so we won't judge you we love you

If you ever wanna talk about it, holla at me
Pick the phone up or come by and holla at me
No matter what time of day and night, holla at me
Don't ever feel like ya bothered with ya boy listen

I'm tryna get you out the bed before ya life is finished
But you keep asking me for five more minutes
If you add up all the extra five minutes of sleep
That you done slept over the years you done wasted nine weeks
At some point you gotta do it yourself
You accumulating dust just like a book on a shelf
I ain't saying what I'm saying just to preach or to bore you
I rather teach you how to fish than keep catching em for you
You possess so much talent and depth
But the problem that I see is you won't challenge yourself
There's a lot of successful people who've been defeated
And tried and failed multiple times before they finally succeeded
You was blessed with the very same thing they got
The only differences between you and them is they didn't stop
Pick yourself up player, stay focused and driven
Cause when you stop chasing your dreams is when you stop living


Don't let the pressure stress ya
You can't go through life feeling like the world won't test ya
What's done is done that milk is spilt
It ain't mentally good for ya to keep holding that guilt
Confession is step 1, changing is step 2
Problem is everybody forgave you except you
If I don't give you this advice what kind of friend would I be?
I'm telling you the same things I would want you to tell me
Feeling sorry for our self, acting like people owe us
Always gravitating towards things that ain't good for us
And girl don't get all depressed over a dawg from ya past
That's like being sad cause the garbage man picked up the trash
You might be blinded by emotion, but sometimes a friend
Can assess your world better from the outside looking in
I can ride with you to the end and believe you great
But if you don't think you are, my thoughts carried no weight",https://genius.com/K-rino-holla-at-me-lyrics
I Just Wanna Know,The Maven,2013.0,"When you ask yourself these questions, just know and understand that, its a lot of us asking the same questions with you
So don't be afraid to wonder and question why things ain't perfect and why things don't always line up the way you plan them
Don't be scared to ask, a whole lot of things i don't wanna know (hah)

I just wanna know what my purpose is, will i ever win or am i just living out worthless years
Can i conquer the heaviness of my nervous fears, when will i ever stop saturating the earth with tears
Tryna overfix a problem only makes it worse, don't ya hate when you do something you can't reverse
Ive worn down every shoe I've put my foot in, when will i finally win for all this hard work that I've put in
How come its so easy to fall in love with people, but so hard to overcome the pain once they leave you
Generosity died when we discovered greed, being negligent and bad and thinking of my seeds
(See) Material things we love indeed, how come we constantly put our wants above our needs
I'm tryna learn I ain't tryna harass they say the only stupid question is the one you don't ask

So i just wanna know how it looks how it feels to be living in a state of peace surrounded by the real
I just wanna know before its all said and done will i ever cash in, will my time ever come
Money don't make me, please don't diffuse it, you with me when i got it but you're gone when i lose it
I feel bad cause I did wrong in the past, I don't mind a little struggle but how long do it last

Ive got my own load to carry I can shoulder that, tryna help unappreciative people, I'm over that
They just wanna try and get a piece of what you're holding back, keep me in their circle like a house in a culdesac
After the breakup, seems like my ex is wiser, I saw her acting so polite i barely recognized her
I argued hard to teach her who she was and who she wasn't, i guess my job to train her for her future husband
I ain't sure of your intentions though im seeing clues, do you ever get the feeling that you're being used
I can't how many times I've been wrong in life, I ain't always right, sometimes i question my own advice
When I'm on the outside i wish that i was in, and once I'm in ( i see there's that nothing i wanna leave again. )?
Cause what good is increasing my wealth, if I'm wrestling everyday to find peace with myself

So i just wanna know how it looks how it feels to be living in a state of peace surrounded by the real
I just wanna know before its all said and done will i ever cash in, will my time ever come
Money don't make me, please don't diffuse it, you with me when i got it but you're gone when i lose it
I feel bad cause i did wrong in the past, I don't mind a little struggle but how long do it last

How come the real souls just got no one to ride for em. Why do we worship shoes so much we sleep outside for em. (foolish)
Deception even in religion now the church is proof, how come we'd rather live in ignorance then search for truth
I say the hood done lost hope and i bet ya whatever, a church on every corner but its more wretched then ever
The dope man getting money at a faster rate, liquor stores too and they don't even gotta pass the plate
Without movement or change we'll never be free exactly, what makes another person mad when they see you happy
Don't tell God how big your problems are the world is his, flip it around tell your problems how big God is
Whats up with the hate on every dime we try to make, i just wanna know how many more beatings we gotta take
When we gonna learn that they don't want us to populate, mustard seeds are real small it don't take a lot so

So i just wanna know how it looks how it feels to be living in a state of peace surrounded by the real
I just wanna know before its all said and done will i ever cash in, will my time ever come
Money don't make me, please don't diffuse it, you with me when i got it but you're gone when i lose it
I feel bad cause i did wrong in the past, I don't mind a little struggle but how long do it last",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-just-wanna-know-lyrics
Let It Burn,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Burn down Babylon shock of the hour
The whole planet caught up in the plot to devour
Righteous men are locked and mocked by the powers
By now you should really know who knocked down the towers
They planning to discount you, slander and denounced you
Scheming at secret meetings, the Bilderburg council
Unidentifiable interstate that they found you
Nothing but lives lost is what it all amounts too
It started when the ships came to Africa to take you
To enslave, you miseducate you and rape you
Hundreds of years later and YES they still hate you
So those who follow Satan get swallowed into the lake too
The cold wicked wind blew, the evil that men do
The sinful of them who pretend to befriend you
But now we at the end where we see God's substance
Rain, hail, snow, earthquakes, the four great judgments

Burn burn Babylon bathe in the fire
Centuries of evil increase the flames higher
Every rule has an end every nation has a term
It's time for the devil to receive what he earned
America long gone, when the smoke clears
And it won't cool down for three-hundred more years
So burn burn Babylon bathe in the fire
Centuries of evil increase the flames higher

Snakes in the temple, no more signs and symbols
A satanic collage is what his mind resembles
It's the end, the finale, bottom line it's simple
If you ride with this devil then it's time to tremble
You see lives are getting shook and minds are getting took
Everything you see happenin' now lines up with the book
Bout to witness things when this country and destiny meet
That make the Vietnam War look like Sesame Street
We in the modern day Sodom, we occupying the bottom
Where our rights a microcosm of all of this world's problems
The Statue of Liberty's a whore, time to fess up
It'll smell like death if you raise the damn dress up
They're try to pull America's demonic hand off me
This country's on the brink of collapse and anarchy
Famine in the land real soon the man taught me
The United States is gonna be like Japan shortly


The water in the land, the economy, the schools
The moral fabric of man, the poison in the food
The lies told daily by media and the news
The shady politics, the sick government are fools
But condemnation is coming an eye for an eye
They send the children to war and die for a lie
And police brutality punish with piles higher
Mile wide tornados, floods and wild fires
No love for inner-city children in the least
The taskforce preparin' to kill them in the streets
It’s hard to overcome and make a pilgrimage of peace
When you're living in a sick venomous wilderness with beasts
Looking at the people and them filled up with sorrow
Knowing what you see today might not be here tomorrow
And once you know the truth of the dragon and it's evil
It's difficult to teach it cause the people don't believe you
We still laughing and joking and violence provoking
Knowing we in the days when God's silence is broken
Calamities unleashing, skies is wide opens
Eyes being awoken to the cries of the chosen
They lied about terrorists and Iraq to fool us
The fuelers of the planes are arrogant world rulers
The flying objects you see that come down to stare at cha
Are there cause they gettin' prepared to wipe out America

Welcome
Uh, to Flow Session Number 1
Flow Session Number 1
C'mon
Uh, to Flow Session Number 1
Flow Session Number 1
K-Rino, K-Rino, K-Rino
K-Rino, K-Rino
Check this out

Yeah, I need a rapper I can call out
I'm going all out like hair after a bald spot
I rip skin ain't no repairing the facial tearrage
Black pen, white paper that's interracial marriage
I turn rappers to vegetables it ain't no use flexing
When I'm done the stage look like the produce section
You can't handle the pressure you need to come harder
My words fuck ya head up like a drunk barber
I shoot slugs rappers debating and reply
I'm out-manning you like Peyton or Eli
You say I'm trash but you steady tryna copy me
You full of shit like a basket at a shopping spree
I want cash so pay me on how my skill rates
Picture my foot in ya ass for twenty years straight
They say I'm heavenly
Cause I gave new life to the game like Viagra did for dudes over seventy
Uh, B.B.I. rap hustlers with plenty moves
You fake bobbing paying notes on ya tennis shoes
My clever rhymes tear stuffing lose
The only punchline you know about is waiting for a cup of juice
Thighs super sick solid as the earth itself
If sick means great then yo' lyrics are in perfect health
Don't nobody support you, you can't be the man
You like a house with no air-condition you need a fan
Flow Session Number 1

See my words got the Dwight Howard jumping Power
The crowd making faces like they swallowed something sour
On trial for cutting seven rappers wrist off
No I didn't plead insanity I pleaded pissed off
You stole my style you gotta a lot of nerve talking
You need to find ya own space like reserved parking
I got some deep stuff to put on ya mind
I call you out like a Hooper with his foot on the line
You ain't never been squat so you dissing my joint
Like a hand with no fingers fool you missing the point
When I come I make 'em hit the gas, lyrically I'm quick to blast
You can say 'hello' and smile and I might kick ya ass
These fly rappers they can't seem to make ya minds up
I'll blow ya watch in the sky that mean ya time's up
I love ya girlfriend every time I spend the night
It's always on like a used car's engine light
I send a two-by-four right cross ya wig
I make rappers move around like foster kids
Feel me homey I'm sick of all this rhetoric
My rhymes got ya open like they set a pick
Everybody wanna get mad and grab heaters
I'm adding money by the minute like cab meters
I'm a force to be reckoned with
Up to no good like a reverend's child watching a nekkid flick
Ya see my words manage to cause nerve damage
Intelligent but still ghetto as a syrup sandwich
I exfoliate; you can't hold your weight
I heard ya rapping, took offence like I stole a gate
My ideology: see 'em in my zone, jab 'em
You shouldn't be allowed to featured on ya own album
If ya got a heater dude you better load it fast
How the hell you a thug taking aerobics class?
(Flow Session Number 1)

He said he warn to be mashed up that bastard lying
I'm primed up to past you because you past ya prime
Women of men if you come forward tryna win
I make you reverse like saying the same rhyme again
My flow grievous it's like a defense with a clone of Darrelle Revis
Covering each of your receivers (woo)
Who could ever ask for more?
I fast-forward past the ward just to make the aftermath come before
See you like to dress up and show up with ya hair all pressed up
But me I the, ca... man I messed up
But then I came back on the same track
Blow ya mind you can't even wonder where your brain's at
Hit the conversation
I vacation in the same cage as eight bears waking from hibernation
Concrete feet in the water, chances of beating me
Are slimmer than a crack head with an eating disorder
I'm taking the game over I'm in large in my zone
Plus I'm building bars up like I was charging my phone
Man I'm out here tryna get revenue while you capping
You can turn the beat off Sniper I'm through rapping",https://genius.com/K-rino-flow-session-number-1-lyrics
Written In Blood,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"(K-Rino K-Rino, over here, over here)
(K-Rino K-Rino False News False News) (K, K)
You in the blue suit at the front
(What's the purpose of this gathering your having here today?)
I mean well, I'm just here representing the Hip Hop community man, in the southern region you know
Actually all the hoods, all the poor folks on the planet
Who've been murdered, raped, pillaged, beat, hung
Economically oppressed, improperly educated, you know
And basically just to say that
The United States is responsible for all this
So as an artist, you know, I feel it's my responsibility to teach people
And tell 'em what y'all chose to hide from us
And err tell you how this country really came to power
That's why we're here
Let's go!

Wherever he lived, he left faces streaming with tears
If the truth hurts, you're about to be screaming for years
Where you been? Everyday he's revealing his hand
It's starts with killing the man then stealing the land
So who the real thief? Who the real worldwide thug?
Watch God rip a hole up in this country you love
Every storm that he conformed was sent from above
Every page in your history was written in blood
They went in and slew Natives till their remnants were through
Your homey George Washington, he killed Indians too
Let me shout out to the government, they use us, man
The police and the trashy ass Ku Klux Klan
Over time they proved to have the greediest minds
These serial killers broke every treaty they signed
Columbus was a slave trader, that's an accurate claim
He took 600 Indian slaves and packed them to Spain
It was straight Hell everywhere them savages came
And damn, what about the 100 million Africans, man?
From the range of this country's dirt, no one's exempt
See, America's a hoe and Israel is a pimp
See this thing was organised, it deprived me
So I'm going kamikaze on these artificial fake Ashkenazi's
Judges, politicians, police and media
The bloodsucking skunks and false preachers misleading you
I wanna see a knife in your throat for tryna cut mine
I pray for destruction of your whole family's bloodline
And that goes for your arrogant seed
Who loved to say, ""If y'all don't like it in this country then leave""
Alright cool, homey, break us off some land and paper
To compensate for hundreds of years of unpaid labour
And that's the only thing that might save you, but we already know that we'll never do it cause that ain't in your nature
The truth of who you are, we've been blessed to find
Now we got a 401K of justice saved up, collection time

(So you don't believe that the government is sincere in it's efforts to spread democracy in the Middle East?)
Haha, Hell no! Next question
(So what do you think about our Homeland Security policy?)
The real question is, is who really needs the security?
America ain't no threat to being attacked, man
They're the ones doing the attacking and history proves it
Let me show you

They bombed China and Korea during the Korean War
Then they bombed Guatemala back in 1954
Indonesia and Cuba fell victim to the trend
Then in 1960 they hit Guatemala again
The Congo, Vietnam in 1969
Cambodia and Guatemala for a third time
Grenada in '83, yeah I remember seeing this
Then Gaddafi in Libya back in 1986
Minister Farrakhan saw that one in a vision he would have
Elijah told him Reagan was plotting with the joint chiefs of staff
El Salvador, Iran, Nicaragua came in time
Then  they blew up the ghettoes in Panama in '89
Iraq in '91, the same year they got Kuwait
Somalia, Bosnia, Sudan in '98
Afghanistan, Yugoslavia over to Yemen
And they never cared about innocent children and women
In 2001 again Afghanistan
Initiated after the fake 9/11 scam
Then they back doored Iraq till they took out Saddam
They called everyone terrorists, but who's really dropping bombs?

Yeah, history don't lie
Don't get mad at me
These are the facts, this is what you did
This is what the United States of America did
So why they try and play it off like everyone else is the enemy?
They been an enemy to the whole planet
Every country, every continent
Every people that was native to the land
They came and caused destruction
These are not lies, these are truths
So take it up with your history teacher
Who teaching you that bullshhh, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-written-in-blood-lyrics
Struggle Addiction,The Maven,2013.0,"Touch that iron enough times
You start realising that it's pretty hot
But at what point do you stop touching it? Come on
You know it never works but you keep doing it anyway
You know it never works but you keep trying it anyway

Real question, why do I indulge in things
That make it seem like I'm in love with pain?
Everybody speculating why the rug was stained
Cause the sweat and tears dried but the blood remained
Now I'm laying back thinking 'bout my cousin, man
I'm on some other sh-, like when the subject change
And the moment that I walked inside, judgement came
Cause I ain't have a dozen chains like Clubber Lang
I guess you could say that I sacrificed some pay
Cause I chose not to sign my whole life away
But anything in hindsight seems suffice to say
And even the broken clock is right twice a day
Now, my main affliction's a pain addiction
The same condition, but I won't change prescriptions
So by definition I'm insane, the custom is scuffing
Cause only a fool keeps going back to receive nothing

I must have a struggle addiction
Cause I won't change my troubled existence
I'm still living but something is missing
Keep doing the same thing, leading to the same pain
I really must love this condition
Cause I won't find another position
I'm too trifling and stubborn to listen
Keep doing the same thing, leading to the same name

Now despite people's envious ways, I'm feeling fine
Only dream that you seem to have is killing mine
I showed love they wasn't thinking about showing
While I was bringing 'em up, I was sinking without knowing
Enabling the slick-hearted to make my life harder
As I'm saving them from drowning they pulling me underwater
Dead weight brings you down, I wasn't knowing that then
It's best to cut a loose string than try to sow it back in
I blame me for failing to move on
Only fools keep walking on glass with no shoes on
Dedicated to my craft, it's been a turbulent ride
Sometimes it takes more away from me than what it provides
Still I keep coming back to it and taking a beating
Like a person who just won't leave somebody that's cheating
And if your plan fell through a few times, let me tell ya
One of the main ingredients of success is failure


See, be true, see through, every blatant and weak move
Deceitful people, Satan waiting to sweep you
Chase new breakthroughs, if you're struggling, make do
You can run for ever but you can never escape you
This learned behaviour was too vicious to discern
Never did you think that your life would be taking this turn
Nothing to be trusted at all, even the kiss burns
Not knowing the feeling of having something when it's earned
Sadly, crafty people seeking to grab me
Into the bottomless misery bag, try to add me
Plus you, now you in deep the pressure because you
Wondering if anybody actually loves you
Turn rat, one that you trusted in done that
Once that happens your confidence never comes back
Systems, twisted, spiritually conflicted
But if you're listening then you're in position to fix it",https://genius.com/K-rino-struggle-addiction-lyrics

I'm a give this fool my money, man
I don't think this fool helping me, man
Oh... I don't know what's going on in my head, dog
I guess I'll just... do the best I can, man... have an open mind
""Good morning K
I hope we have a real productive session today
Lay back and try to extract the pressure away
What's on your mind is at your own discretion to say""
Well Doc, I'm in the mood for confession today
Since adolescence, I've been stressing and destined to spray
Every time I mess up and need a blessing, I pray
Then I commit the same sin and throw my blessing away
""Are you spiritual?"" Yeah, but I'm barely submitting
""Do you believe in God's mercy?"" I wouldn't pray if I didn't
A voice speaks in my head but I refuse to hear it
""That's your conscious, some call it the self accusing spirit""
Hmm, so you're saying that's God?
""No, you said that, and the fact that you did is odd
Now I'm wondering how come it is you're wondering this
In my opinion, I don't think you feel like God exists""
What the fuck you talking about, man, you trying to be funny?
I ain't paying you for this bullshit, man, give me my money
""Calm down, don't get upset, I just want you to listen
I'm only saying there are times in life when God is missing""
God is with me, I ain't no atheist, save that for them
""He's with you but the question is, are you with him?
See according to the laws of physics, even in one's mind
Two things can't occupy the same space at the same time""
I don't think I understand can you repeat that again
""In other words where there's God they can be no sin
And where there's sin there can be no God, so don't confuse
Try to combine them, you lose, it's your option to choose""
Okay, so what I need is division, between God and sin
""Just like you do with me and religion""
What? ""In other words you seek guidance from me
You make me out to be everything your preacher should be""
You're tripping fool, you ain't my master you ignorant bastard
""Then why do you come to see me instead of your pastor?""
I just... (sigh) Man, it ain't what you said
Matter of fact all you're trying to do is mess with my head
You're trying to make me think I'm crazy ""No, I just want to help""
In reality I feel like you kinda crazy yourself
""I'm a trained psychotherapist, I don't have to take this""
And when you bust that word down it says ""Psycho, the rapist""
""Vent your anger K, that's what you've been needing""
If I really vented my anger your ass will be bleeding
Don't ostracise or patronize me
Your job is to wisely analyse and logically advise me
""I see some progress, I'm somewhat astonished
If I ask you a few questions will you answer them honest?""
Go ahead, man
""First off, what's the hardest you've cried?""
It was 1982 when my grandmother died
""How'd you feel?"" I was bad but I was happy I met her
If she was still alive today I feel my life would be better
""Do you wish that you could see her?""
I don't know
""Do you ever-""
Hey man, look I don't want to do this no more
Let me ask you some questions, ""Do you ever cry?"" (Sometimes)
Have you ever fucked your secretary? Well can I?
""Don't be ridiculous"" I'm being real, you see how it feel?
One more stupid ass question I'm a pull out my steel
Matter of fact I'm gonna pull it now ""What are you doing?""
""You're gonna get yourself in trouble,"" fuck it my life's already ruined
Yeah, you're scared now, come on analyse my behaviour
With this pistol in your face your degrees can't save you
""You're making a big mistake K, put the gun down""
Shut up, I'm in control hoe, lay on the ground
You listen to me, I want you to say, 'Please don't kill me'
""Do you want to kill me K-Rino?"" Nah, not really
I want to kill the way I feel and act, and murder my demons
Until my thinking and God's will fall in agreement
""I think we're finally breaking through but it's too early to speak""

Really Need You,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"To tell the truth, when I look at all that's going on
How can we cosign for this world when we know it's wrong?
Under a spell conjured to keep us forever blinded
If we not looking the answer then we'll never find it
A lot of people don't believe that God even exists
But in the darkest parts of trouble, know he's in the midst
They say ""How could he let this suffering happen if he's real?""
My response is, ""He created man and gave him will""
Free will to choose if he would rebel or follow laws
So when there's trouble was it God or was man the cause?
You get resentful cause you prayed and still your mother died
Get mad at God so now you switching to the other side
You ain't the first to take some news and have to face the blues
Angry emotional responses, that's gon' make you lose
See you can win this race without having to finish first
You gotta trust Him when it's rough and more when it's worse

Give me some knowledge that'll really work out, follow proud
See, serving God is more than singing songs and shouting loud
Your bank account and house don't factor in your life success
And he don't care who got the best suit or the nicest dress
And plus the preacher need a recipe to bless the streets
The church ain't brining in the youngsters 'cause the message weak
The painted image didn't prove what it appeared to be
Some people find him quicker locked up than they did when free
We need soldiers with boldness to pull us out the grave
These cats afraid of the people that they supposed to save
No use in tryna make 'em do it, God I hope and pray
'Cause when I think about it, they don't even know the way
We say, ""Yeah, Jesus is comin, we can speak for that""
But will he like the way his house look when he get back
We walk around not even knowing we been fed a lie
But some do know and they still just choose to let it ride

God we out here getting crucified
Guide us to understand disunity is suicide
Help us to settle our differences minus foolish pride
And make us grateful for the daily blessings you provide
Right now when enemies oppress us we don't make a sound
Give us courage to fight those who want to take us down
Give us the wisdom to know that we at the end of days
So when you start killing your foes, we won't be in your way
Bring us out the mind frame of jealousy and lust
Stop us from blaming other folks for what we do to us
Guide us to treat our woman better and not cause 'em pain
So that they'll see you when they look at us and do the same
What we need from you is true strength to face the powers
Because right now when our children look at us they see cowards
So when it's all said and done help us remove the scar
I guess that I'm just asking you to be the God you are",https://genius.com/K-rino-really-need-you-lyrics
Enigma Class,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"Please don't ever wake me from this glorious dream

The oracles back storing a stack of historical facts
In a portable pack for you mortals to jack
Still absorbing attacks from these insubordinate wacks
After recording my acts I'mma fast forward it back
My mental forces react and have intercourse with the track
My pen'll torture you black cause of many sources you lack
I orbit galactical stratospheres morphing to bats
My tenor voice can impact and leave Finnish porcelain cracked
I'm not a pessimist or a Methodist, I'm guessing the best
Description of my true essence is a heavily dreaded exorcist
The question of second is a genetic risk so I'm catching this retched tricks slipping like necklaces on a headless chick
I go from soul to soul and I roll as far as the ocean go
Froze enough testosterone overload to throw a stove
I control this globe but on my old abode the flowing mode
Is so imposed that K-Rino was the lowest on the totem pole
Plus my soldiers know when I'm throwing bows I cause my own broken nose
Rope-a-dope and shoulder roll, I do both of those
These hopeless so-and-so's need to know their roles
I won't disclose the untold total number of flows that my folder holds
I never Cadillac, matter of fact, I'm so careless that a snake was mad cause I snatched him and wouldn't give his rattle back
Choke you out and shake you like a soda pop, do a photo op
And elbow the top of you corona's hood till the motor drops
The elite strategist, have a seat as I eat with the scavengers
While I speak and defeat your complete battle list
People retreat faster than master mathematicians freak calculus
Little bastards, you ain't a star, you an asterisk
Copy this cause your style is impoverish, the popular novelist
The pen I'm jotting with is the size of an obelisk
Emerge ripping, gifted with earth-splitting, curb-lifting
Wordsmithing, get hurt for disturbing my third vision
These Merth Griffin-looking, perch tripping, burst them
And let the black hearse from the church get em for being on my turf slipping
Then give em the worst whipping you'll ever witness through any search engine
Just for twisting and bringing that purse with him
I stand accused for scandalously handling tools
I shoot at your granny shoes and make her do dancing moves that Hammer use
I recommend you say I'm in the most clever 10 fellows that ever been and when they grin, I'ma spin them to where forever ends
I kept them in my sights with a special lens and they never slept again
I'm stepping in a sweater made out of leopard skin
Styles thrust a million miles up when I get riled up
And leave the alphabet in a twenty-six letter pile up
Enigmatic classes are drafted
As I practice doing gymnastics back flips in the oncoming traffic
Practically undistracted by cars crashing and flying at me in batches somehow I happen to leave with no scratches
The Darth Vader suit wearing heart-taser
Don't try to spar with K, choose an inlay in a burning car safer
Chase you a hundred and four acres
Every song I make is wrote with a black chalking marker on dark paper
The underwater great white shark racer
Partaker in war capers, truck park sniffing exhaust vapors
The odds are hardly working your favor
As I elevate my verse over my head, so just call me the bar raiser",https://genius.com/K-rino-enigma-class-lyrics
Be Careful,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"No heart, selfishness and no consideration
For the next man or woman but why
Only focused on our situation
See somebody suffering we walk by
They might approach you when in need of assistance
At a time when their fortunes are low
You look down at 'em like you better than 'em
But the truth is you just don't know
We got angels among us dwelling in our presence
God will bless us then place someone in front of us to test us
You can't get a large sum of money or a new car
Then look down on people because they might not be where you are
Drunk off possessions and the root of all evil
But no man can rise above the condition of his people
Don't be arrogant and arid, patience is perseverance
Learn to look inside of someone instead of judging by appearance

Be careful how you treat strangers
You may be entertaining angels who came to protect you from hidden dangers
In disguise, studying your ways is what they do
The deed you neglect to do, could be the one that saves you
Be careful how you treat strangers
You may be entertaining angels who came to protect you from hidden dangers
In disguise, studying your ways is what they do
The deed you neglect to do can be the one that saves you

When trials fall on us we don't look into them deep enough
We view them through a real small lens
Instead of understanding it's all apart of living
We resent God and turn on friends
Then help comes to you one day
In the form of a person that you might not know
But out of deep ignorance and lack of understanding
We ignore signs and let help go
See, have you ever met a stranger and had a conversation
And it seemed like he's familiar with your life situation
And you know never told him but his knowledge is surprising you
Speaking wise words, giving guidance and advising you
Striking mental cords, blood in your vein coursing
Giving you the comfort and positive reinforcements
And you start to question in your mind how it's being done
I'm not saying this for sure but you might be seeing one

Be careful how you treat strangers
You may be entertaining angels who came to protect you from hidden dangers
In disguise, studying your ways is what they do
The deed you neglect to do, could be the one that saves you
Be careful how you treat strangers
You may be entertaining angels who came to protect you from hidden dangers
In disguise, studying your ways is what they do
The deed you neglect to do can be the one that saves you

See you gotta be aware of your surroundings at all times
And everything is not what it appears to the eye
The thing you look down on could be the thing that saves you
Saves you

These marvels are far beyond carnal
They warn you of unseen forces that might harm you
Alert you of people and things that could hurt you
And unknown to you from wrong steps they divert you
The place you started to go but then decided not to
And then disaster struck, if you was there they might have got you
The time when your finances couldn't last a month more
And out of left field a blessing landed on your front door
Someone you never met just approaches and starts talking
Touches you saying, ""It's gonna to be all right"" and keeps walking
It happens quite often and we get attitudes
Mean and rude when someone exudes a caring mood
Angels all around probably see them all the time
Not to mention the personal one that lives in your mind
Keeping you from falling and guiding you on the low
That's why it's wise to respect all people you never know",https://genius.com/K-rino-be-careful-lyrics
Rain and Wind,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"First off, I know your situation but what is quitting gonna prove
Your heart was in the right place your head just made the wrong move
It's safe to assume that that's the world we all relate to
Somehow you gravitate to the ones who use and hate you
Still looking for a break through, felt like this is childhood
Not many people willing to listen to you but I would
It's natural to wish you had a friend that you could call up
Your life was rough I understand why you gotta Wall up
Because folks lie, anything you wanna hear they say it
They gain your trust only to turn around and betray it
And left permanent wounds on your heart but you managed
And at the end nobody helped you repair the damage
I wish I had the power to visit moments in time
And eliminate all painful events out of your mind
Because I'd do it in a second if that would make you whole again
Like you used to be before you let those dirty vultures in

If I was rain I'd wash away
Bad memories of sad yesterdays
I wish that I could be the wind
I'd blow away the pain within

You ask yourself why'd I fall victim to this evil
The fact is, bad things do happen to good people
And just to prove that I know how you feel to be exact
I'm a run you through the process cause I've been where you at
See first the problem hit, then people started to deny you
And Then it reached a point where you was asking God why you
But keep love inside you, we know you not an angel
It's good to get advice but only you can change you
You say yeah but it's painful, but that will soon disperse
Remember most things that give happiness come with pain first
Then the cries transform to rejoices in our voices
Let's benefit from not be the victims of our choices
Now take this mirror, look into it, see beyond the flesh
Call the greatness that's inside you out and let it manifest
What was done is in the past so quit trying to relive it
The only power that it has is the power that you give it

If I was rain I'd wash away
Bad memories of sad yesterdays
I wish that I could be the wind
I'd blow away the pain within

Don't get rattled no matter what rough road that you travel
Female or male emotional foundations are fragile
The mother who passed you to another after she had you
You can't expect to come away unscarred in life's battles
There's no contentment, only regret and resentment
For those who showed ill intents since you was an infant
Getting high will never last gotta try and let it pass
You need a mental cleansing just like a dianetics class
Now, how many people could of resisted that slight urge
If somebody could of got to them and spoke the right words
And it's clear now your problems won't just up and disappear now
And ain't no use in wishing you could switch it because you hear now
These young soldiers in the streets living fearless
And I'm a realist I know exactly what you trying to deal with
And that's the reason why these words are like a prayer session
For all the trauma I ask God to give them their blessings

If I was rain I'd wash away
Bad memories of sad yesterdays
I wish that I could be the wind
I'd blow away the pain within",https://genius.com/K-rino-rain-and-wind-lyrics
Creative Expression,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Do you feel it? Do you feel it?
I don't think you wanna leave

In a slowmo spasm my poetic solo has 'em
So unravelled it'll cast 'em past Cro-Magnon back to a protoplasm
Before he holds the notes I pass him, he'd rather go to sleep
In a haunted open chasm and gladly let the ghost harass him
Callously, tearing up these babblers and then I slap
The dead rapper cause he refused to give me dap afterwards
I check and wreck actors in spectacular fashion
I'm the next chapter of adamant neck-cracking assassins
The man who shows you examples of ample mic controlling
Slick handles while standing underwater holding a lit candle
The tracks I make many don't advocate, they navigate
Fast through the air and space at full capacitated travel rates
They numerate too rapid to calculate, my massive accolades
Smack your face and leave gashes just like a sack of blades
Rappers fabricate and exaggerate, to challenge my talent
Was their mistake so I abrogate and dilapidate
Classes paid to see how I shatter fakes, I'm booked to assassinate through the day so you might have to wait till after 8
Blessed with higher level intelligence, swing the mic like it's a
Crescent wrench and leave not a spot of detected evidence
Assume I'll take your head soon, so smooth when you asleep I built a train track that runs through your bedroom
Musical flesh wounds infect tombs
I love to contest goons, I keep monsoons hid in my guest room
Harpoon beats on each wall up in the room speaks
I sneak kabooms under sheets in honeymoon suites
The complete setted scene of heresy
Cleverly I speak a melody and infants within 3 seconds be elderly
If MCs wanna travel in the right direction
Follow the light reflections casted at midnight by my mic collection
You can't escape from the hell I make
I detonate and leave an entire galaxy roped off in yellow tape
I'll demonstrate the ones that I make
No need to rap an hour straight, my 16s equate to 108s
Many spit rhymes at a dominant rate
But assuming the length of it makes it great is a common mistake
So refrain and maintain your proper lane, you and I are not the same
I got an invisible force field that blocks the rain
Removed his veins when the music came, I don't drink
Through the main orifice, I hold water bottles up to my brain
They read what the final score said, the EMTs found the beast dead with my mark carved on his forehead
In my REM state my alpha waves disseminate
Creating movement powerful enough to blow the wind away
Cylindrical neck aggressively read sermons
I'm looking over my shoulders without my head turning
His beat down was incomplete now, the referee found
After checking the film I didn't have both of my feet down
Beyond the subatomic neutron, upon my birth I was only a crumb
And out it the rest of my body grew from
But after that I changed how that was set
Experiments with new travel jets led to my conception before my parents met
Can't conceivably imagine matching equally
I'll argue and fight with you even when you agree with me
I'm tuned to all intimate sounds, so when these lines knock you down, I'll hear you hit the ground from way outta town, fool",https://genius.com/K-rino-creative-expression-lyrics
Astronomical,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Ladies and gentleman what you are about to witness is an experiment that will change the world
What we have lying here is what's known as a lyricist
As you can see the subject is completely subdued
He is in total physical and mental submission
The mechanism you see attached to his head is called a thought transferal device
It is activated by voice command
The subject has also been programmed to respond only to the sound of my voice
When I give the word the subject will automatically begin to release thoughts
One verse will instantly extract every ounce of lyrical ability from his brain
Rendering him a vegetable
OK everyone stand back
Go!

Rhymes designed to murder ya lines from the mind murderer
Time for blind massacre words be chasing after ya
I'm astronomical (I'm astronomical)

Unexpected disasters, bastards testing the master
Blessing the masses with paragraphs that will blast ya
To smithereens, the guillotine that fell from the 
mezzanine
Just landed but started falling back in 1917
By whatever means I'ma sever spleens
While I perfectly describe a thousand murders that I never seen
Your flow is comical, mine is astronomical
Watch the phenomenal writer blow holes in your abdominal
Then I'll plummet through the sky like a loud comet
Lyrics make the Sun beam thoughts that make a cloud vomit
Snitches lay next to shotgun shells
Once he dead man I promise you he not gon' tell
For the hell I spiked the Kool-Aid with scorpion venom
If some aliens attack, don't run to me for help I probably sent 'em
To take me out you gonna need a few more hundred men
One thousand is my ranking on a scale from one to ten
I leave ya staff guessing in the lab stressing
Paragraph blessing, here's a math lesson
Action, when I take your soul from you that's subtraction
When I split you in two halves then you a fraction
Fast or slow, it's best ya know not to test the flow
It's K-Rino, I'm colder than a homeless Eskimo
I'm a potential mental patient
A science fictional manifestation of another man's imagination

Hmm, this is unusual
The process has been successfully completed
However, he seems to have more brain power than we anticipated
His monitor indicates that we can potentially extract one more which will double the amount of skill we are trying to extract
I'm about to attempt go into his mind and gather one more
Go!

My raps will shatter anatomical compositions to shrapnel
Twist you up horizontally, vertically and diagonal
I'm the scary one, paragraph killer copied by everyone
Rappers mangled so bad it turned vultures to vegetarians
I'm laced with flows so sharp each word places
Five slashes like a blade that made faces look like K-Swiss
I flame throw, you maintain the same flow
In cloud battles I make colored blood stains drip out of the rainbow
My life get to the point where it don't matter what you spice with
I'm immune to stab wounds, he kept jugging me 'til the knife quit
I was foreseen by an Ethiopian queen
Not in the past but in the future, 3017
I'm a live threat that survived 725 threats
You witnessing a prelude, the real me hasn't arrived yet
My rough courses are taught by unseen forces
In a cold cave with a witch, two leprechauns and a sorceress
I transcend, concentrate ya levels, no man been standing
With a cello on my chin playing mentally with my hands in
When he slept all you heard was mad screams
'Cause he was dreaming that he kept waking up from bad dreams
And each dream contained a hundred more dreams with different scenes
Prolonging paralysis with multiplied recurring themes
And I do it smooth, my epilogues making the music move
Twist your brain up with my hand and mash it back up like a Rubik's Cube
Historical, my eloquence is categorical
Travel through portals, the immortal metaphorical oracle
Made provisions to purchase ammunition and construct criticism
And slaughter kitchens where I mass produce apparitions

Rhymes designed to murder ya lines from the mind murderer
Time for blind massacre words be chasing after ya
I'm astronomical (I'm astronomical)

I can't breathe, this wasn't supposed to happen
He somehow reversed the effects of the procedure

Barbedwire Discipline,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"You know lately I've been envisioning, intentionally, injuring

While you wet clothes and fake your pimp mode
I'm gathering chemical info on how to make your neck lymph nodes implode
When I go home, I bathe in ozone
Take my microphone and crush your dome like ice and slurp it like a snow-cone
I spark a shot at those who talk a lot
Put garbage rappers on a murder auction block until the coffin plot market's hot
All my lines are so unorthodox, they entered you like carbon monox'
And you'll be still alive while your carcass rots
The sickest dude you'll ever hate
I elevate and raise the bar as if I was making a nightclub levitate
You'll never be the one like seven-eighths
I'll become irate and strap you to a tailgate, then drag you through eleven states
Emcees scorched with a million degree torch
Your thoughts are small enough to fit them all in a flea's corpse
Your rap image got resemblance to a lesbian broad
You looked the part, you flipped your tongue but you can never get hard
I stay in the mode and steam-rolled right over my foes
I'm on the stage ripping up shows in a Doberman pose
My flow is errorless, to withstand the test you need a better vest
I'm never stressed and always starting shit like the letter 'S'
Unanimously denied your amnesty
At your reunion I handedly mopped your family under the canopy
I start and run upon ya with a sharp persona
Target you in the farthest part of Venus hiding in a closet in the darkest corner
Equipped with a flame that will rip through a train
Scriptural gain pointing at you with centripetal aim
The antithesis of the word 'insane' bleeding disdain
What I inflict is beyond torture, you'll be pleading for pain
Murder juice is what my thirst produces
In gestation of these exclusives leave you heathens steaming green mucus
Atrocities hit and stop ya nine bodily systems
You'll get gutted out like jail house sodomy victims
Pay dues, my rep is huge, you set new records for skill ineptitude
Methods I use reduce decrepit crews to residue
Exposing fools, my words are valuable like stolen jewels
Your flows are used, you turn them back in when you use 'em like bowling shoes
Maniacal fiend that seething for green
Put cyanide in an asthmatic rapper's breathing machine
My omnipotent ambiance will turn a room blue
1% of me inside of a 100% of you over consumes you
Delivering barbedwire whipping discipline
Backspin the remnants of your non-existence, ten dimensions past oblivion
I mastered wizardry during my infancy, I'll blink and instantly
Remove you from the archives of living memory
Soaring above the Earth's flooring, I'm orbiting
Foraging through scorching unseen dark matter specs exploring the origins
The impact of my most average raps will fracture your scapula
Drain the sap from your cardiovascular with a catheter
Technology in my mind exceeds the current time
Like somebody using an iPod in 1689
You should know there be no decoding my poetry
My opponents keep coming slower than rolling three lines on a rotary
The one man genealogy, my bloodline's author
I'm myself, my future offspring and my own grandfather
The laborer, the great outerspace phrase caterer
Nuclear wave raider, sabre-tooth hater disabler
The solar rollerblader, I skated across craters
State of the art debater, thoughts integrated with Darth Vader
In victories I'll never get enough, my sick degrees will rip you up
And leave a gash so critical that I'll have to zip you up
He killed himself because to face me is double
He knew my schedule was busy so he saved me the trouble
If you mad I'm not the one you should blast on
Listen I'm so twisted that under my real face I got a mask on",https://genius.com/K-rino-barbedwire-discipline-lyrics
Father of the Flame,Alien Baby,2011.0,"Father father, I'm so happy that you could come
(Why wouldn't I come, I told you I'd be here)
I'm glad you made it on time (Where is he?)
He's this way follow me (How long has he been in this state?)
It's been about three days
(I'm going to need everyone to leave this room
I will contact you when I'm finished)

I'm the helter skelter, bomb shelter melter
Stealth atomic Alka-Seltzer, top and bottom jaw welder
The secular thought exitter
The whips from my texts are so extra wretched it stretches from you to the derelict standing next to ya
They gathering to battle us
Ghastly unaware of the fabulous passages in my vast cavernous thalamus
I'm not a catalyst of avarice
I send raps in the mail that are more hazardous than anthrax packages
The rap arachnid track critic
Who Ju-Jitsu kicked the blue sky and left a massive crack in it
I'm par excellence, user of sceptre wands
The genius spawn of uninterpretable lexicons
My anger hits high peaks that leave my eyes reddish
Explosive technician with a homicide fetish
Composed a symphony the first day life entered me
No doctor was needed, I performed a self delivery
My raps should be in a castle inhabiting lavishly
With every manufactured character mapped in a tapestry
The sheet was seemingly blank, so the pitiful think
It was literal, but I write words in invisible ink
How much pillaging can a page do?
Well if it's mine it'll encage you and electrically taze you back to age 2
I salivate above a cauldron
That's so hot, it takes a century just to cool down to scalding
In the ring, ain't no burning me out
You'll never get a standing 8, you'll get a laying down eternity count
I see through blizzards clear, everyone's in fear when the wizard's here
They placed a sheet over me, but when they raised it I had disappeared
I deceptively envelope you
My depth is too heated for you to swallow like a new born sipping Theraflu
I got several methods to stretch you in my weapon pool
So move unless you got an extra neck to lose
K is never in a glamour mood
I'm a tyrannical fool who cannibalizes cannibals on channel 2
The ill mannered Bruce Banner dude
Who built the mechanical war craft without even reading the manual
I'm sarcastic and cynical
I got blinded amnesia but I still didn't forget to not remember you
My parables are unbearable, I stare at you
Then shoot a verbal arrow through, let it slice and make a pair of you
Storms come after the thunder starts, one spark'll become a thought
I never left my feet and did a somersault
I throw a spear through the clear blue and pierce you
Until you scream so loud Venus people will hear you
Once a year I appear new
Got a mystical vehicle that lets me see a thousand miles back in the rearview
I operate under several names, mic murders I can have arranged
I stomp and trample brains into gravel grains
Imitators become so enthralled, but once my vocals go in y'all
They toxifying cake up on your colon walls
I'm so skilfully gifted
That I spit 6 verses on 7 beats and every one of 'em were different
The next move I made was colder
7 flows on 6 beats, one each and had nothing left over
I'm here, but I appear in disguise
I've take inferior guys and make their eyes dematerialize
I did a historical check, exploring my depths
And discovered I went to war with men before my conception
I be exploring facts and recording tracks
That go deeper than swords in backs and whacks from Lizzy Borden's axe
Experimenting new delayed effect raps
You walk away today, but months later your neck snaps
We are not on a even accord
Six months old, I was receiving a lifetime achievement award
Lyrically I am the omni, it's not beyond me
To gain energy from swallowing red bull tsunamis
I'm never in a cautious state
I go fishing for prehistoric prey in morbid dark waters and use sharks for bait
Your epidermis will rot during a skirmish
I learned to tie his neck into a tourniquet knot
Man I promise you don't know the half
Every picture of my family from the last hundred years, I was in the photograph
I enjoyed all the trauma that my rap employed
They paranoid from delusions of circular trapezoids
I bomb your vehicle unrighteously
Your windshield wipers were a sight to see, trying to wipe meteorite debris
The sci-fi movie enthusiast
A student of unruliness broke loose from Mt. Vesuvius's nucleus
Antibiotic lyricist, any mental impurities I'm curing it
Illustrator of thought, the cloud muralist
My pen is like a quick clean scalpel
I sleep strapped to dream clap you, rap example of the Sistine Chapel
I'm schizophrenic leprechaun crazy
I mate with robot ladies and create Decepticon babies
My narratives leave average men babbling
For faster land travel, I'll grow some back legs and start galloping
I himahoola abracadabra men
And wrote a whole album in 5 minutes with my miraculous magic pen",https://genius.com/K-rino-father-of-the-flame-lyrics
My Laughs,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"My head snapped in the worst trap, I see my foes taking dirt naps
For years I've been running full speed but I'm just finishing the first lap
Is life really about coming up? Or is the purpose really about love?
Trouble real easy to get into but it's hell getting out of
My childhoods all gone now, it's tough standing on my own now
I miss staying in my momma's house gotta keep remembering I'm grown now
Got struggles that I got to overcome and mountains that I got to go beyond
I'm staggering, disoriented, feeling all spaced out and I'm the sober one
But I made it through a lot of long years it's like the moneys where the wrong is
It's bad when that devil's on your shoulder, but some days I be on his
I'm steady walking down the wrong route, I don't smoke but I'm zoned out
The streets ain't got nothing on the war that I'm fighting in my own house
From sun up to when the sun's down, my hearts weighing bout a ton now
I exploded like a bomb sound, everybody telling me to calm down
But I won't stop until I get enough, my stress cup keeps feeling up
I'm acting like I'm happy, but I'm about to go insane cause the pain's building up

If you only knew the days I've had
The tears that live inside my laughs
Come grab my shoes and walk my path
The tears that live inside my laughs

Am I frustrated? Extremely. Dirty analysts they wanna screen me
I've got a storm brewing in my mind but you'd never know it you've seen me
See I've never been a cutthroat dude and I've never been too fly to listen
They say that nice guys finish last well I'm guessing that explains my position
Cos other than this deep harassment, I be shoveling through hate and madness
And theirs trouble in my mental cabinets, smiles covering my inner sadness
Tryna empty out my whole song vault, been hit up with a lot of thrown salt
My daddy told me 99 percent of things that happen to you are your own fault
I'm hated because I'm not manipulated I waited til my mind was liberated
I made it possible for other cats to make it but the love was not reciprocated
And it's loading up because I never vented, I'm getting more aggressive by the minute
And I don't care how good and generous you represented, everybody got a limit
I lost touch with myself it's gone, I'm disconnected like a telephone
I'm tolerating what your saying but I'm thinking please leave me the hell alone
Some peace I was looking forward to and patience is what I'm showing you
Man, I don't wanna take it out on you but I'm about to click from what I'm going through

If you only knew the days I've had
The tears that live inside my laughs
Come grab my shoes and walk my path
The tears that live inside my laughs

All my with and I prayed my inner strength I displayed
When my confidence was hit by a relentless brigade
Yeah I spent what was paid every cent that was made
Flashbacks post dramatic memories bad events were replayed
I was lynched and betrayed, though I'm meant to be saved
But through it all for my God I will represent unafraid
I never bent and never laid, hate they sent was like a blade
My existence in the game others tried to prevent but I stayed
There's no pacifying, the whole world is dying
But whose gonna be the one in you, gonna wake up that lion
And break up that dying, fist up those eying
Miss who keep trying to posses them their defiance
Meanwhile I'm just trying to fight with the powers of my own vices
Everybody walking 'round lifeless they ain't knowing every second's priceless
A civilization in a crisis, wish that I could turn on a light switch
Tryna get my name on the right list scared to bust at 'em cause I might miss

If you only knew the days I've had
The tears that live inside my laughs
Come grab my shoes and walk my path
The tears that live inside my laughs",https://genius.com/K-rino-my-laughs-lyrics
Need To Know,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Here we go again
How many people you know that's really like
How many people you know that's really like this?
Real friends don't bend
In fact I wanna say that again
Real friends don't bend

I don’t stroke no egos or praise fake heroes
I live by the code of daily energy reload
It’s hard to trust people so I stay in only me mode
A grown person should never be a beggar or freeload
Confide in me, don’t expect nonsense responses
Don’t ask me my opinion if you can’t handle the content
People have their minds already made when things hit ‘em
They just ask you for advice to see if you agree with ‘em
How can I make it better, if I’m being fake to ya?
The best type of friend you can have is a straight shooter
Be open to a true honest character diagnosis
‘Cause others see things about you that you don’t notice
Just take it on the chin when they check you ‘bout your dealings
As long as what they saying is real, stay out your feelings
Don’t label them a hater ‘cause they doin’ you a favor
And even if it’s painful, you’ll thank ‘em for it later

I’ma tell you what you need to know, not what you wanna hear
It’s on you if you deny the facts when they coming clear
Running from truth is a wasteful move
The hardest person that you’ll ever have to face is you

Some people won’t ever change so let ‘em be that way
You got your hands on a brick tryna mold it like it was clay
But it’s still hope for others, stay on ‘em ‘cause it ain’t over yet
Hold the net ‘cause homies be slippin’ like the floor was wet
Life don’t always wanna accommodate us
Like getting caught by every red light when you runnin’ late
They need you to keep it real but you act all soft
What kind of friend would sit and watch another friend fall off
And not at least try to talk ‘em through the condition?
I know you’re thinking, ""I can’t force a grown person to listen""
And that’s a fact, but you don’t have to give so hard
‘Cause once you tell ‘em what’s right, man, you done did your job
You bendin’ over backwards like an acrobat
But all that you can do is pray for ‘em after that
Sometimes a conversation gets uncomfortable and heated
It’s hard to help somebody when they don’t think that they need it
Yeah

I’ma tell you what you need to know, not what you wanna hear
It’s on you if you deny the facts when they coming clear
Running from truth is a wasteful move
The hardest person that you’ll ever have to face is you

Don’t treat me like I invented the problem
Love don’t always come in the form of grinnin’ and smilin’
Talkin’ down and critiquing, that’s a hell of a difference
Sometimes you got to sit a person down to tell them they trippin’
It don’t matter who it is, check ‘em when they ain’t right
If we can’t be honest with each other we really ain’t tight
From a grown man all the way back to my youth
I respected any man who ever told me the truth
If I recognize your issues and don’t pull you first
When somebody else tell you, it could be worse
Sugar-coating is a weak move, being real, that’s tough
You might have to get broken down to build back up
And if it leads to you hatin’ me, I’ll pay that price
It’s worth it ‘cause what I say to you might save your life
I don’t judge your circumstances, my love come free
If I don’t try to tell you something then that blood’s on me

I’ma tell you what you need to know, not what you wanna hear
It’s on you if you deny the facts when they coming clear
Running from truth is a wasteful move
The hardest person that you’ll ever have to face is you",https://genius.com/K-rino-need-to-know-lyrics
Head Punches,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"We gonna call this one Head Punches
But I guess at the end of the day it could pass for a Flow Session
Let's go

I turbo boost words that shoot, ripping your shirt loose
Your baby mama's bare feet look like work boots
The fire throat, not a guy that you should try and coach
My quotes are more terrifying than a flying roach
One punch gave that head about fifty knots
My shine is hard to block like Nowitzki's shot
If you was smart, you'd get out this place
Cause it's about to get ugly like Donatella Versace's face
They say that you one of the hardest but I beg to differ
I ain't impressed, you more trifling than a pregnant stripper
If K-Rino respond to garbage, I'll mow your lawn
You so boring you could make a dude in a coma yawn
It's been a while since I let my pen, break a folder
But like a dude who lost a hundred pounds, the wait is over
You're still young but you're flow older than Abe Vigoda
Smack you dead in the face with a case of soda
Man, it's ridiculous to ask you to come and rap
It's like the ventriloquist sitting on the dummies lap
Your skill will never come close to this
Plus my catalogue's longer than a section 8 grocery list
I'ma tryna teach you the game, hoping that you learn
You want my crown, let's go a round like two u-turns
You're feet ain't clean enough to run on my turf
You're house so filthy you could sweep the rug up under the dirt
It's time to mash so I'm attacking your pad, bro
My lines: so over your head like a bad 'fro
You wanna match, we can each drop 30 racks
And I'ma take you to the cleaners like some dirty slacks
I'm despised by these dishonourable guys
Plus I'm dangerous like raggedy-assed carnival rides
Everywhere I go, people wanna walk with me and trail a pro
But you're respect is so low that your yes-man even tell you no
I'll catch you, it don't matter where the Hell you go
It's funny cause these clowns is watered down and still fail to grow
See last year you was rocking the masses
Now you in HGB parking lot rounding up baskets
Meanwhile I'm lighting flames, your talent ain't quite the same
Your rap skills fell off worse than Tiger's game
Remain cool as I run a sharp pain through ya
I got so much game I'll sell your own brain to ya
I ain't forgot what you said, you gon' pay for your hatred
I'll take the air out of your chest like I play for the Patriots
I turn the heat high as it go, somewhere to burn worse
And put and L on you on you every day like Lavern shirts
I say a lot about myself but I can't say enough
Cause I'm so real they give me change before I pay for stuff
You on the internet, fronting and dissing like Man
But you just faking, that ain't you, you catch fictional fans
When I'm really fiending I open up a stranger's chest
I'll catch an airplane from South Park to Bangladesh
I pop domes for running your mouth, homes
And your son keep asking your wife how come you got a blouse on
I'm hanging every mic holder, 23 and older
I can't get high cause I'm addicted to being sober
Doing shows with K-Rino, you need rougher flows
Cause I'ma shut the building down like it ain't up to code
I stay snapping cause I know that keeps my fans happy
I'll sell African medallions at a Klan rally
All I see is a bunch of wannabe hot coons
Bouncing on the stage in Peter Pan costumes
I got a pack of mics for rappers who ain't acting right
And after I beat you to death I might just beat you back to life
I never lose my motivation out on these streets
I'm still hungry like 10 obese people splitting a three-piece
After I spit this, I'll have to murder the eyewitness
Some of the things I did ain't even none of my business
I'm in the rafters with hundred, fifty and twenty stackers
I don't take shit from no one like a friendly jacker
Your punk card I'll pull yours like a rip chord
While you roaching, I'm holding paper like a clipboard
You know I go hard in the paint till the track dies
So now you fronting like you got help on the back side
You run up on me then it's slumber time
You could never come behind K-Rino like 8 to the number 9

Like 8 to the number 9, yeah
Sniper, Lil C , K-Rino
We Makin' Enemies everywhere we go
I ran out of flow",https://genius.com/K-rino-head-punches-lyrics
Phony,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"(K-Rino talking)
Yeah, take a journey into my life
But you won't have far to go
Cuz.... mines is yours
We all gon' through the same things

Don't ever misinterpret me, I'm glad to be alive, G
I put two and two together though and I keep coming up with three
It's hard to rest, when you see the evil some people possess
It just multiply stress, my depression's even depressed
Countless times I extended a hand to help a friend in need
Only to misread because for me the same wasn't received
You called me when you was flat broke and wanted K hook a loan up
When I said, ""Cool""; you was at my house before I could hang the phone up
See, I'll break bread and feed ya, these days homies'll bleed ya
Their procedure; borrow money then get selective amnesia
You try to give 'em time but that seems to be worthless
Knowing he owe you coming around showing you things he just purchased
Then they start ducking your calls, you know how you can tell?
Cuz all you get is half a ring and then it's straight to the voice mail
So, what the Hell? I guess I gots to leave these cats alone
Another friendship dead and gon' over a couple of hundred bones
(Chorus)
People so phony, phony
I feel like it's me and God only, only, only, only
I can't let it phase me, phase me
I'm trying hard to keep from gon' crazy
What? To keep from gon' crazy

When I detect a suspected lie, it's hard to let it slide
An artificial female friend milking your sympathetic side
Money I would give, not lend, was down with her to the end
Not from a tricking standpoint, I just considered her a friend
Kind of mad I didn't control this, never fathomed she would go this low
But now I'm tripping over this repeat pattern that I noticed
Like clockwork, an hour after every time she leave
She be like, ""Baby, I need some money, can you help me please?""
And I'm like, ""OK!"" Might pay a bill or help her knock the rent off
Every time she came around my gold-digger alarm went off
But when I needed help and asked for it the game flipped
She had more excuses than the pipe burns on a crackhead's lips
And it's a trip, cuz when it's time to show me they my homie, they don't
And if I need 'em to do something for me, they won't
So now it's all about me, one syllable
And artificial people get cut loose like umbilical
(Chorus)

The doctor checked me out and wrote me a prescription with the quickness
But the side effects of the medicine was worse than the sickness
See I sacrificed for others but the same love didn't follow
I wish I had a dollar for every time that I wished I had a dollar
I regret sometimes not having a biological seed
Anytime that it was ever proposed to me I disagreed
If they persisted to insisted, I just packed up and I slid
Too many of my partners paying child support, ""Ohh hell nah, not the kid""
But if I did, maybe then hope would seem more realistic
To be gifted with a reflection of my own characteristics
Cuz most people are senseless, self-centered and pretentious
Any show of love is meant to benefit their own interest
My eyes are now trained to spot game when it arises
The wisest people learn how to see through those disguises
Cuz fakers show more fiction or depictions than HBO
Fraud to real is a 99-to-1 ratio
(Chorus)",https://genius.com/K-rino-phony-lyrics
I’m A Problem,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"I'm that dude that slashes you with no utensil
Step back, aim and blast at you with a loaded mental
Crowd in disbelief, they never heard what I teach
Like being dipped in grease when I’m serving the heat
Every time I leap, treacherous words form a speech
They find at least a million dead birds on a beach
You can fight me (strike me) cuss me (bite me)
Never have you ever seen a killer quite like me?
Evil (shiesty) regal (feisty)
Squeezing the life from three people nightly
Practise (classic) ratcheting (tactics)
Murdering savages that I have to interact with
Multifaceted, nasty and accurate
Make a task come alive after I fashion it
Like a fool on dip, I’ma wild out
Whole lot of missing people up in my house
Man, not a telephone won’t dial out
I’ma snatch you up by the collar from a mile out
Channel my energy to expose you on contact
Load you in a canon and send you where the Sun’s at
Combat with facts wherever I’m at
Spit a library of almanacs on one track
Say you’re the best, so K the King don’t try ya
Travel in your head then rig them wires
Make ‘em retire ‘cause I ain’t big on liars
Tie your woman up then set her wig on fire
Go into the jail house, blow the wall out
All the killers and murderers, I’m let ‘em all out
This is the fallout ‘cause I know what y’all bout
Y’all breaking the peace so I’ma go to war out

I’m a problem, I’m a problem
I leave ‘em feeding from the bottom, from the bottom
Hunt ‘em down like a monsoon as I spot ‘em, when I spot ‘em
The skills you claim, I hope you got ‘em                                             On that microphone it’s well known that I’m a problem                                                      I’m a problem, I leave ‘em feeding from the bottom, from the bottom
Hunt ‘em down like a monsoon as I spot ‘em, when I spot ‘em
The skills you claim, I hope you got ‘em
On that microphone it’s well known...

Problems I'm solving them, I'll ruin you and make you wish your world ends
I'll show up at your date and beet you down in front of your girlfriend
I build my rap, spin moves, then side step
I work my pen out so much that it's looks just like a bodybuilder's bicep
But enough of jokes, I'm sending your whole form up in a puff of smoke
I'll amputate your limbs then I reconnect them to other folks
You was grinning, swearing you would win
Until you felt the right hook come tearing through your chin
The punishment then etched in, never would it end
Got a pen that's deadlier than a heroin syringe
I'm a rap pro, O.G., macro, blast those that don't know me, coming in the back door slowly
My goal is to jack your soldiers, mash on a rapper like afro Kobe
See I get trapped inside a time warp every now and then
For the first 11 days of 2016 I was 10
See I'm the one that threw the bomb that landed on your flesh
No need for a uniform, my team name's branded on my chest
I'm in my power stance, damaging cowards man
My click is like a clock 'cause if you diss us, in a minute you gon' see our hands

I’m a problem, I’m a problem
I leave ‘em feeding from the bottom, from the bottom
Hunt ‘em down like a monsoon as I spot ‘em, when I spot ‘em

Hunt ‘em down like a monsoon as I spot ‘em, when I spot ‘em
The skills you claim, I hope you got ‘em
On that microphone it’s well known...

I hold the mantel and stand in preparation for the grand battle
I can travel unnoticed camouflaged inside of an ant's shadow
The sacred robe of unjaded greatness I'm draped with
I shake pits and wears snakes on my wrists like bracelets
I straight rip until I make the lithospheric plate shift
Decapitate you just to save your paper on your facelift
I'm down for the cash, astounding and brash
Give you a tattoo with a needle that I found in the trash
Now I'm getting real hungry, time for breakfast, man - everything in front of me swept in flames
Vocabulary range insane, I'm about to replace Webster's name
See, when the track's too rough to wreck on
I'll connect two stones to some lead prongs and wear them instead of headphones
The profit gainer, a bottle rocket flamer, cock and aim at a gossip bringer
Hanging in a locked container, sparring with a robot boxing trainer
The day I lose to rap buffoons
The Sun will shine bright at midnight and be followed by a pitch black afternoon

I’m a problem, I’m a problem
I leave ‘em feeding from the bottom, from the bottom
Hunt ‘em down like a monsoon as I spot ‘em, when I spot ‘em

The Debate,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"Were we created or did we evolve? How did we arrive?
What's the purpose of our existence? Why are we alive?
Tell me who do you believe in? To what do you subscribe?
And when it's time for you to prove yourself, how will you survive?
Were we created or did we evolve? How did we arrive?
What's the purpose of our existence? Why are we alive?
Tell me who do you believe in? To what do you subscribe?

First I'd like to thank y'all for coming out today
We would ask that you close your mouth and pay close attention to what we're about to say
My name is K and I'm your moderator in this great debate
We're tackling a topic that's highly prevalent state to state
To my left an evolutionist atheist, he'll be stating his case against
The man to my right who's a creationist
For the sake of history a camera specialist is taping this
Did a deity create this or did we evolve as a basic gist
You, Sir (Well the Bible states in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth
So everything we see here was his hand at work
This man's a jerk I've read his books and seen his lectures
Even studied all his tapes about how we were lifeforms that evolved from apes
I ask you how could a intelligent being come out of a lesser being?
This is the thing with which we're wrestling
The Universe and man are God's creation, just admit it pop
If we evolved from apes and apes are still around why did it stop?)

Were we created or did we evolve? How did we arrive?
What's the purpose of our existence? Why are we alive?
Tell me who do you believe in? To what do you subscribe?
And when it's time for you to prove yourself, how will you survive?
Were we created or did we evolve? How did we arrive?
What's the purpose of our existence? Why are we alive?
Tell me who do you believe in? To what do you subscribe?

OK your time is up you'll get a chance to talk some more
But at this time we need to let our second speaker have the floor
Let's give the same respect to him and not speak all at once
So we'll pass the baton to your opponent, now for his response
{
Well the concept of life evolving and the way that things were brought in
Was fathered and authored by Charles Darwin
Your assessment of what we believe was improperly covered
We only speak of how one life form changes into another
You believe in God but can't prove there's a god and this is vital
Your theology is based upon a contradicting bible
You don't worship him you worship idols and hold self-righteous dispositions
If God is real why is this world in this condition?
I feel humanity has had enough of this lie
You praise a spirit that allows people to suffer and die
And no matter how much you pray and look up to the sky
Things remain corrupt..} Alright, your times up to rebut and reply

Were we created or did we evolve? How did we arrive?
What's the purpose of our existence? Why are we alive?
Tell me who do you believe in? To what do you subscribe?
And when it's time for you to prove yourself, how will you survive?
Were we created or did we evolve? How did we arrive?
What's the purpose of our existence? Why are we alive?
Tell me who do you believe in? To what do you subscribe?

Right now, this debate is winding down
We're finding out some things now so we'll let the evolutionist start this time around
{Well as for the Universe we've never said who made it
Evolution is not the theory of how life originated
Your failed connection and theory rejection
Is only evidence of your lack of comprehension in the process of natural selection}
(Well motion and order are the first two laws of the Universe
We don't agree that stars and planets are the result of a big burst
Think of the perfect celestial trajectory
How things operate successfully with intricate detailed complexity)
{Can you believe this idiot sitting next to me?
See you're speaking scientifically, prove God did it and break it down specifically}
(I've done that through the scriptures, what you've heard is the truth
Whether it's Bible or Qur'an, see God's word is the proof
And I agree I'm speaking scientifically we're in compliance
But my last question to you will be, who created Science?

The Serpent,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"The masses fell and were jailed in a stomach of the bastard whale
Who prevailed over the hell of the dragon when he cast his tail?
Since the slave trade in the Trans-Atlantic
Man's been granted grace until Allah's judgement spans the planet
It ain't hard to recognize the enemy
Who you say you are is nothing to me, words prove identity
With typical non-ethereal spiritless individuals
Habitual partakers in Babylonian rituals
Unrighteous acts be flipping you like fraction reciprocals
The nature of the original we abandoned those  principles
At the time so integral and pivotal
We need to focus on the God and try not to deviate from being spiritual
The Serpent was in the garden and the light of the Sun
Not a snake but a man with the characteristics of one
So understand no matter what you believe
The best way to avoid deception is to know that you can be deceived
The man had sprung you to his land and beat you and hung you
It's the Satan of the Bible and the Qu'ran living among you
They told you about a Hell that burns hotter than the Sun do
But after knowledge comes you've discovered that it was untrue
There's evil institutions and ungodly solutions
The cross you wear was used as a tool for execution
They claimed to be Christians but they set it on fire
How can you honour something that was used to kill the Messiah?
They say that you would go to Heaven when you die and leave here
But the earth is a sphere that already sits in the atmosphere
To keep you in bondage, you're not worth a damn
But Elijah reverses the scam of the curse of ham
Our lower nature, I've been tryna rise above it for years
Money's not the root of all evil, the love of it is
The real Devil is right behind you, how fast can you run?
He replaced his white sheet with a badge and a gun
And a web was spun to kill and plants seed of war
Close our mental door and ignore the needs of the poor
The procedure was tedious, centuries in deceiving us
Histories of previous people not heeded and repeated us
In a snakish manner, he lies when his eyes see the camera
I seen him fiending for blood in Jena, Louisiana
They poisoning our hoods to bleed and weed us out
We attempting suicide every time that we leave the house
Treated the Black man lower than canines in a kennel
And made us believe that our condition was accidental
All we do is sing songs, we done suffered too long
Look at they world and look at yours and tell me something ain't wrong
Blacks falsely characterized in America's eyes
But now the rest of the world is getting wise to America's lies
The Devil quickly waves his wand and negativity responds
When the Black man wants to be sworn in with his hand on the Qu'ran
How can they contradict the basis of they own foundation (hypocrites)
When the White races who founded this nation were Masons
Masons who studied Islam and secret societies
But not original so they couldn't receive all the degrees
Slave owning presidents, who played the role of divine
The constitution was never designed with Black people in mind
George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, straight down the line
All the way to Bill Clinton and Bush in the present time
Blood spill, and a quill was placed on the Great Seal
It's start coding then revealed on the back of the dollar bill
He deceives the whole world and lies to the whole nation
Through his wicked interpretations on his main news station
FOX represents the number of the beast
Resolute the three letters you'll find a six in each
F is the sixth letter in the alphabets mix
O is the fifteenth, one plus five equals six
X is the twenty-fourth, that's six number three
Satanic messages fed to us over the TV
Put us to sleep with new forms of mental slavery
Cause if you knew the real God you would instantly be free
From The Serpent!",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-serpent-lyrics
Gone Away,The Maven,2013,"This is for everybody who has ever been in love
No matter how hard you try to act
We all walked in them shoes
Once it was gone, you had to figure a way out

I use to think meeting someone like you was impossible
But five minutes of time led me to needing lots of you
Didn’t really know what to expect once I met with you
How was it so easy to automatically connect with you
Kept it true with you, your conversation was helping me
Even though you knew my discrepancies you accepted me Wondered could you and me ever be, it was just crazy
Physically was miles apart, mentally we touched daily
Compatibility and chemistry was real again
It was a hole in my life and you filled it in
The more I talked to you the more the I was feeling the distance
Actually cared about my thoughts and was willing to listen
Felt something from the moment that I seen her
Everything was perfect on her from her looks to her demeanour
Even though I wasn’t with you, I was no longer alone
Can’t believe I found a person like you, but now I'm tripping...

'cause she's gone away
Everything we had, everything we ever did
Just gone away
Used to be happy that you was in my life
Now every day’s a lonely day
Nothing is the same since the day I realized
That you was gone away

Whenever a new day would begin
I’d hear your voice and I’d be like a 7th grader again
Now I’m out of the picture, I wish that I could come get ya
I miss jumping in and riding shotgun with ya
No fussing and arguing, just having a blast
You gave me the peace of mind I never had in the past
It was hard when you used to ask if we'd be permanent
But my situation was too complex to determine it
And even though our situations was throwed
Through the duration I was grateful for the patience you showed
Every minute spent together was consistently good
You used to say, ""Let's run away"", I’d say, ""I wish that we could""
And I really did, but somehow when we begun
For you to walk out my life, I knew that moment would come
And believe me I would understand ‘cause no one in their right mind
Would wait a whole lifetime, now I'm tripping...

'cause she's gone away
Everything we had, everything we ever did just gone away
Used to be happy that you was in my life
Now every day’s a lonely day
Nothing is the same since the day I realized
That you was gone away

Feeling bad 'cause I’m wrong, hard to leave us alone
Missing you when we apart, thinking about that Usher song
When you said you loved me, I wondered when will it dissolve
Expectations change once you get feelings involved
I’m locked in, still certain questions popped in
If we so happy together how come we not then
Both of us did things that caused the other pain
Still it’s hard to picture you driving in another lane
I know its selfish but losing you ain't optional
The feelings that I got for you—is friendship even possible?
I guess it is ‘cause after we stall
I’d rather have you as a friend than not have you at all
And over time we can let it go and be fine
Deep down I kind of knew you wasn’t totally mine
And I wasn’t totally yours, so you did what you felt you had to do
Now I gotta moved on minus you

'cause you're gone away
Everything we had, everything we ever did
Just gone away
Used to be happy that you was in my life
Now every day’s a lonely day
Nothing is the same since the day I realized
That you was gone away

Maybe in another time, another place
Maybe in another time, another place
Another dimension, another space
I can see your lovely face",https://genius.com/K-rino-gone-away-lyrics
The New Professor,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"Ok, class, settle down. I'd like to introduce you to your new teacher. His name is Mr. K
Mr. K, would you like to tell the class about yourself?
I’m your new professor
I've improved the lesser message of your clueless testers
They've been removed, I am the new successor
The first assignment that I’ll burst your mind with is to break the earth's alignment
Find six different time zones and reverse the climate
Of course I'll time it within the glass where the sand particles pass
That's ten books that you must read by the end of class
This is the only way to teach you right and make you see the light
And I forgot to mention you have to read each one twice
No pens allowed in this assembly
Complex math and chemistry must instantly be committed to memory
And after you complete your twenty reads, focus your deep internal energy
Then learn to speak the language of the centipedes
No need to call you to the floor, what would you have to walk for?
I brought a self-erasing, levitating chalkboard
Every lesson is taught at Mach 4
Even the clock stops to watch your body as it learns to float through locked doors
Many fall from stress long before they acquiesce
‘cause it's hard to pass the test without cardiac arrest
Your brain use amount is tiny, 10 percent or less
But if someone reminds me, I'll help you access the other 90
We'll studying making seconds moment-less
I'll need a five page essay describing future inventions that don’t exist
And after that, you’ll have to try and top it
Hope your mind can process bringing in a real volcano as a science project
The more progression, the deeper the lessons
Ninety multiple choice options on each of the questions
I'll teach you to build things without reading directions
My standards so high that I’ll punish you for reaching perfection
And once I broke the spell, all of you will learn to read unopened mail
And bring a thing that can't be shown or told about to show and tell
Before we scratch the surface, I'll just test a person first
And every thirty seconds, blurt a whole semester's worth of work
The consequence for bad behavior is wrenching
Sending you to detention in an evil, wicked dimension
And even though it’s only minutes, the time seems like a thousand ages
So many courses, the report cards are a thousand pages
Each slide of history recited in its chronology
Unabridged dictionaries, every word's etymology
The Iliad and The Odyssey, you'll judge them with mockery
You'll even see the blue object that floats over the top of me
My classroom is an abnormal regime
Homework is rubbed into your forehead in the form of a cream
And no matter what you do, don't ever touch this bright folder
If you miss one day of class, I'll start your whole life over
Then at recess, we play with gamma rays on average days
Ten millenniums of curriculum all on half a page
And every mind in here, I'm linkin' ‘em
Which means you never have to raise your hands
You ask me questions by thinkin' ‘em
Increments of time I'll wrinkle ‘em
And teach you how to carry galaxies in your book bags by shrinkin' ‘em
You will see me as ugly, I don't need you to love me
Life or death pop quizzes on subjects that we didn't study
I'm sure you notice several older people here in the class
There's students from my former school who haven't managed to pass
They've been with me since they were young, each class and each stage
‘cause one of the courses that they kept failing was mastering age
You'll have to learn to see through people's minds like x-rays do
And if you somehow pass the class, I'll teach the next grade too
So with that said, my preamble is through, pleasure to meet'cha
By the way, I'm Mr. K, your new second grade teacher",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-new-professor-lyrics
Step Into the Mind,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Step into the mind of the mystical one
The futuristic lyricist kills the white plan
Beat down the prejudiced, take back the land
Burn down the White House, raise the black hand

You underestimate K 'cause you feel certain
Now you’re hurting for going head up with the steel curtain
Flirting with 
death
, run your game I'll kill it
Couldn't burn me if we battled on a stove in a fucking skillet
Pass the broom, I'll act as a janitor
Sweeping remains from South Park to Canada
Weigh 'em up, grab the Black Book and slay 'em up
Fast break, bounce pass his ass, I’ll lay him up
Hard as steel, MCs prepare for the hollow kill
Then place my face on a $400 bill
MCs bug me, they mentally drug me
As a child all I needed was somebody to hug me
First I'll meditate then release a karate shout
Mentally lock doors, nobody in, nobody out
Back in school I was known as a creeper
Graduated with the Shadow of Death and the Grim Reaper
Suckers never wake up, they try to kiss and make up
But I don't shake up, I'll take my fist and break up
And then crack is all that's left for me to do
You came to get this ass whooping that was so sweet of you
Beat a crew to death, take you deep in the tunnel and buck
If you were smart you would make like Donald and ‘Duck’
‘Cause if you don't I’ma leave you salted and peppered
I'm like a killer leopard mixed with a German Shepherd
Silent torture but still the unknown hear it
I had a séance and summoned my own spirit
K-Rino the mercenary melodical wiz
You got 1 second 2 pass a 3 hour quiz
(A) is guns (B) is gas (C) is knife drilling
Pick your death ‘cause it's a multiple choice killing
With my thoughts, K-Rino could deliver a nation
Inside my brain lives a whole other civilization

Step into the mind of the mystical one
The futuristic lyricist kills the white plan
Beat down the prejudiced, take back the land
Burn down the White House, raise the black hand

When wartime starts I'll go where the guns go
Death left your family mourning like Alonzo
No hope to pass when the scholar is testing ya
All hail the mercenary mystical messenger
Some doubt the skill knowing danger lies under hope
The ass whoopings in the mail sealed in an envelope
Died in the past but resurrected in '70
From Earth clouds to Space and now I'm mentally heavenly
I speak in this illusion though my image deceiving ya
You told the world you saw me but nobody's believing ya
Kill me many times but I'll win if I want ya
I'm two spirits deep, meaning the ghost of my ghost will haunt ya
I think at light speed while some rappers' minds are slow
Eye to eye contact permanently blinds my foe
No foundation ‘cause your style is baseless
Lyrical slaps left the competition faceless
Taste this furious style so serious
That it left seven Klan members on their periods
Still kinetical, verses virtually edible, incredible
Watch me wreck the country in alphabetical order
Front page has the prejudiced nation repenting
ABC means that Africa's Bombing Clinton
Life is over if I hear you're a Klan backer
DEF means Destroy Every Fake-ass cracker
Praise Allah as I grace the Islamic Nation
GHI means that God Has Inspiration
When it's wartime, don't start folding up
JKL means Just Keep Loading up
Dissing me is so foolish, I wouldn't condone it
MNO means to Massacre Next Opponent
Watch the media mutilate all of our leaders
PQR means Prejudice Question Readers
God is wind, snow, rain and the thunder maker
STU means that Satan's The Undertaker
Thoughts of pain give the planet a quick decision
VWX Visualize World X-ray vision
YZ means You'll Zoom till your mind rattles
Last trick to diss died two years before the battle
Heat'll freeze you in my click while cold will scorch you
Battling me is like 10,000 years of torture

Candy,Family Bizness (Mixtape),2004.0,"Yeah, you know how I do
K-Rino in the house, S.P.C
I done did the cartoon characters and the cars
So now I'm bout to do these candy bars, you know how I flip it
Murder One in the house, that boy K.O. in here
We chilling in here with my boy Mark
Yo we gon' flip a little story like this, check me out

I was chilling with my homeboy 
Milky Way
He be on the corner 24 hours a day
I met this young hustler by the name of 
Twix
He was asking a gray owl, how many licks
What it take for a man to make a female cum?
He said, ""Hmm let me see"" and went and got him some
I stepped to him with a 20 and asked him this
Could you tell me how to find this girl named 
Hershey Kiss
He said the last time I seen her she was selling her butt
For 35 bucks a hit on a dopefiend cut
If you try to scoop her up, you better handle your bis'
She got a pimp named 
Snicker
 and that ass is his
So I hopped in my ride and I flew downtown
To this gun sho, to pick me up a couple of rounds
Of artillery, ain't nobody killing me first
Needed help, so I called my homeboy 
Starburst
Now my boy wasn't no punk, he packed a punch
Fought this hater named 
Nestle
 and his ass got crunched
It was pay day, we knew he had some bank in his hand
Checked his briefcase and inside was 100 grand
When we got to that spot 
Hershey Kiss
 was sold
Saw some freaks on the block doing the 
tootsie roll
They was looking at me crazy, so I got suspicious
Saw two freaks, 
Blow Pop
 and 
Bubblicious
, uh

We talking 'bout candy
Ooooh-oooh, I'm talking 'bout candy

Hershey
 came back about a hour or so
Riding in a car with my homeboy Z-Ro
I called her name, but she hopped in a long black Caddy
Left with this rich old man, a 
sugar daddy
Man I got's to follow 'em and learn the truth
Went to a dope house, ran by Big 
Baby Ruth
I saw this dude named 
Reeses
, a mixed up brother
His daddy was chocolate, but his mama was peanut butter
Walked inside the place, Hershey saw my face
She said man K-Rino, what you do in this space?
I said I came from South Park to put you on lock
But I ain't know that you was out here going hard on the block
All of a sudden all I heard was the sound of a car
It was 
Snicker
, 
M&Ms
 and 
Mr. Goodbar
He said now who is this fool with my woman tryna fade her
When you want your life took boy? Now or later?
They wouldn't let me have her, so I tried to take her
Got my ass whooped by a damn 
Jawbreaker
Some 
M&Ms
 ran up like they was the man
But bullets melted in they mouth from this heat in my hand
That's when my girl 
Hershey Kiss
 came out with a pump
Told them fools she set 'em up from the jump
Stacked a half a million and counted our cuts
Starburst
 cocked up and straight took 
Snicker's
 nuts
We raised up and got caught in the middle
Of a gang war between the 
Lemon Heads
 and the 
Skittles
But we made it out of that, it wasn't no thing
They was fighting 'cause somebody got beat for some 
candy cane
My homie 
Starburst
, he wanted some butt
So he boned 
Almond Joy
 'cause that night he felt like a nut
I looked at Hershey and said baby can I hit that
That's when I stuck my 
butterfinger
 in her 
Kit Kat
Uh

We talking 'bout candy
Ooooh-oooh, I'm talking 'bout candy

Man, we ain't talking 'bout nothing but candy (candy)
Ha-ha-ha (no), OK that's enough of that",https://genius.com/K-rino-candy-lyrics

This is an exorcism, the exoskeleton
X-strap the back with his next flow
, listen
Electrovision that rest of molecular texture
In this irregular secular mechanism
You diagnosed with doses
Of uncontrollable scoliosis, plus liver cirrhosis
Witness the original, lyrical everlasting
Individual spiritual, metaphysical mastering
Blasting your zone, with a wrath never known
The path of science and math crafted in stone
My deepest exegesis drafted alone
The devilish staff was born and grafted a clone
I elevate with spawns that are sacred
Create biological elements that I mate with
The evangelical adamant, radical
Murder capital admiral who rappers stagger and battle
I am the sorcerer, broke through the corridor
The 220 century galaxy orbiter
Straight from the infinite thought booth I taught him
How to combine to Summer, Spring, Winter and Autumn
My staff is steady as acid when I cast it
1 to 150, the demographic
No match, no matter where you look for the Heaven

There is no escape from 
Book Number 7
You're not outside, you're actually inside of 
Book Number 7

I throw hundreds of sunlit punches in abundance
You in a dungeon that dwells within the infinite circumference of my conscience
I send and receive intergalactic faxes
At night my body relaxes, raises like taxes and levitates over the mattress
I transform into a sandstorm, might take the form of a newborn
With a baby's body and a 35 year old man's arm
There’ll be no sympathy sent to ya
I make an entity enter ya as I mentally circumvent your peninsula
The intensely temperamental mic emperor who increases the temperature
And makes sure you receive every ninja strike meant for ya
Opposition you don't hear a word from them
K-Rino's the one who picks up the hitchhiking murderer and then murders him
I stand on posters like coasters
They've been after me before my birth, my ultrasound picture was on a “Most Wanted” poster
Metallic plates strapped to my shoulders
Vultures fly out of my folder after I bust and reiterate every flow that I told ya

I am the author of

There is no escape from

You're not outside, you're actually inside of

No more CDs, technology has finally evolved
Albums in pill form, you swallow 'em and let them dissolve
Then you feel mushroom euphoria in your brain when I storm in
You not only hear me recite the songs, you see me performing
You thought you had writer's block, your brain was starting to swell up
But that was me killing your ideas before they developed
I'm bruising ya ‘cause I'm half super nuclear
You can fit your skill in mine the same amount of times Pluto can fit in Jupiter
I load revenge into a syringe, opponents then cringe
As the needle penetrates within your contact lens
Laid with excruciating pain, they use my style
Like a 120 consecutive root canals
Meanwhile, my horrors cancel your tomorrows
I speak words that the authors of the dictionary and the thesaurus borrows
Blast my gun with ‘The Wrath of Khan’
The Jurassic mastodon that easily won the scholastic triathlon

I am the author of 
Book Number 7
You unleashed the power of 
Book Number 7
There is no escape from 
Book Number 7

On This Road,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"Grab your keys, mane

On the road to happiness there's a lot that you gonna learn
You're gon' hit a lot of bumps, you gon' make some wrong turns
Keep your GPS on so you won't go astray
Cause you gone drive through some rough neighborhood along the way
Keep ya eyes open keep rolling no matter how you feel
Whatever you do, never fall asleep behind the wheel
Got a long trip ahead of you, obstacles on the track
Let prayer be your spare if you catch a spiritual flat
Only takes a sec to do it when its hard keep pressing through it get a mental tune-up every now and then check your fluids
The scriptures like an owners manual your gonna need it
Life gotta speed limit, make sure that you don't exceed it
Be prepared for change cause no day is the same
Don't be foolish and reckless, when you travel stay in your lane stay cool and level-headed when people try to plot
Cause you gone break down if you let em run you hot

On this road learning on this path that I'm traveling
Watching it unfold as it happening
Anywhere I go near or far
You missing the point if your thinking I'm talking about a car
On this road learning on this path that I'm traveling
Watching it unfold as it happening
Anywhere I go near or far
You missing the point if your thinking I'm talking about a car

On the road to happiness you gotta move with heart
And there's gon' be some days where your vehicle don't wanna start
Watch ya blind side hold the wheel don't get shaky
Anytime you hit the road you have to strap in for safety
Stay on your mission try to avoid the collisions
On the dark streets turn on your high beams for vision
Keep in mind you might get lost sometimes
So pay attention to directions and always follow the signs
You don't give the right signal, better not try to pass
You might be sitting on E about to run out of gas
You may not be able to fill up and go where you planned
So put what you got in your tank and go far as you can
You gon' get caught  up in some traffic but you can't let it down
You don't be distracted watch out for the drivers around you be cautious of where you go until your journey's complete cause you don't wanna wind up on a dead end street

On this road learning on this path that I'm traveling
Watching it unfold as it happening
Anywhere I go near or far
You missing the point if your thinking I'm talking about a car
On this road learning on this path that I'm traveling
Watching it unfold as it happening
Anywhere I go near or far
You missing the point if your thinking I'm talking about a car

As you start to ascend, drive smooth and glide through the wind
You'll see people start to get jealous of the ride that you're in they'll cut you off and cross you so check both ways
Gotta stay composed and try not to get road-rage
Do everything that you can to complete your plan
Don't wanna end up on the tow truck or the repo man your
You gon' see some other you like and some will look good
But the body can fool you better check up under the hood
It's all about being focused and knowing your route
Because the wrong type of accident can total you out
A lot of people gone sit on your passenger side with you
There's gonna be some you wished you never let ride with you There's a city called Depression and a town called Hate
When you make it to Negativity just keep going straight
You gonna pass some haters but don't let your pace decrease cause that's the only way to make it to a place called Peace

On this road learning on this path that I'm traveling
Watching it unfold as it happening
Anywhere I go near or far
You missing the point if your thinking I'm talking about a car
On this road learning on this path that I'm traveling
Watching it unfold as it happening
Anywhere I go near or far
You missing the point if your thinking I'm talking about a car",https://genius.com/K-rino-on-this-road-lyrics
Crazy World,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"Yeah we living in the crazy world
What makes a man want to touch a little boy or rape a baby girl
What's in your mind? I don't have a clue
What makes a dude kill a young innocent brother for a pair of shoes
No turning back once the weapons bought
Pull a trigger on a person, take a life without a second thought
Hoping they stop the madness but they don't
Young ladies using what's between their legs to get what they want
Everyday it come in different ways
Don't give a damn about killing folks with dope long as they getting paid
Evil activity, day and night
Children growing up and murdering the same parent that gave em life
We love to hate because we hate to love
17 year olds getting life sentences from a racist judge
Stealing your prize right before your eyes
Satan got us so deceived he standing right next to you wearing no disguise

When I woke up this morning, It didn't faze me
Nothing changed man, the world's still crazy
I'll say it 'till the song ends, It don't amaze me
Nothing changed man, the world's still crazy

It's a shame how depressed we get
Looking in the mirror, hating the features that God blessed ya with
You barely hanging, 'bout to reach the end
You hate your blackness so you get your nose done and try to bleach your skin
We rarely doing what we need to do
You treat your babies in same abusive way your momma treated you
Lies, deceit, every word we speak
What makes a man hit a woman just because he insecure and weak
Disrespectful to God's higher law
The government manipulates the media with lies to justify a war
The wrong people try to lead and teach us
Savage creatures, fake religious leaders, money hungry freaking preachers
We scared and ain't nobody taking charge
What kind of man manufactures diseases like he was making cars
A bunch of children won't be fed tonight
But you got doctors who can turn men to women if their bread is right

When I woke up this morning, It didn't faze me
Nothing changed man, the world's still crazy
I'll say it 'till the song ends, It don't amaze me
Nothing changed man, the world's still crazy

Redirect you and take you off your true course
Contaminating every food source
Keep the poor folks down and destroy foreign nations
Build prisons, there's more money in incarcerations
Plus they responsible for every drug that you on
Already got a jail cell for your new born
And their politics never fix homelessness
They just walk right by 'em like they don't exist
Police pull out pistols and they kill quick 'cause they real sick
No one properly deals with mental illness
Artificial food they feed you, non-organic seeds too
The medicine kills you faster than the disease do
Politicians lie to appease you, pacify and ease you
While secretly planning to impede you
The Devil is a killer and a thief too
He'll kill his own people so why the Hell would you believe he needs you?

Crazy times man
We need God more than ever
We need ourselves
To fix this thing man",https://genius.com/K-rino-crazy-world-lyrics
Exposing The Motive,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"You don't believe that they doing what they doing huh?
You think everybody just be talking about it
It's all made up, it's all a lie
Life is real good

For seconds, minutes and hours decrepit feminine cowards
Limited by the fear of the devils primitive powers
Satan's syndicate vows to kill every remnant of ours
The dragon enters the house of the righteous then it devours
Following what they teach and won't try to see what's the purpose
Cursing, addicted to the technology that you worship
Murdered for their works cause it obviously deserve it
Lies and deceit and spiritual poverty in the churches
Taught you that you was scorn, systemic division harmed you
Brought you into the storm and then forces religion on you
Always knowing the truth but changing that was the mission
Burning crosses in yards while claiming that they were Christians
Reversing what the truth is and gaming you with precision
The conquerors and dividers are blaming you for division
Democrat or Republican, how can you trust a liar?
Court systems and government homicide justifiers
Rights of premise desires are at the root of oppression
The deception that believe in you fixing through an election
Lie and connive is the only way to stay alive
10% of the population ruling the 85
Everybody slaves to electronic devices
No nutrients in food, what you get from it is lifeless
The trouble in Iraq, the US wanted the crisis
That's why millions of dollars was spent and funded to ISIS
Historically shady, plotting against you daily
United States crazy, pimped by the Israelis
60 years of payment that they be coming off gladly
America ain't nothing but Israel's sugar daddy
And planned parenthood got a lot of ghetto locations
Purpose of operation, decreasing our population
Abortions are promoted, our future children in danger
Created by a racist woman named Margaret Sanger
Drug companies got to make sure you spend enough bread
How the hell are all these herbal healers ending up dead?
Got to keep all the money circulating by all means
Any time you see a CVS you see a Walgreen's
Prescriptions written by doctors
Sickness is all around you, initiated to legally kill you over-the-counter
War waging, by the food and drug administration
At 39 you on five different medications
The hood takes the rap for the real narcotic sellers
Elitist kill us, just go and study the Rockefeller's
Many don't want to tell us, they designed it and let it
They fearing the reproduction of black and brown genetics
Guns said to be legal so to the people that handed
But even when registered if you black it's a double standard
They let the weapons in back then, today they still do
Trick you to pack them so it's warranted when they kill you
And then we kill each other, your own brother will bust ya
Playing into the hands of the one who set up the structure
Instagram, Facebook, Snapchattin and Tweetin
Clicking, typing and scrolling and sharing, nobodies reading
Money is in decline, there's little value if any
So now this Devil's tryna put Harriet on the 20",https://genius.com/K-rino-exposing-the-motive-lyrics
Spiral Vortex,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Well, if you can withstand the wind
Maybe, but then again, maybe not

This spiral vortex consists of hard threats that'll scar you like war vets
The wind can sever Corvettes and toss jets
I'm raw like Tyrannosaurus Rex
My thoughts paint vivid detailed portraits and you just saw a raw sketch
Satellites with extreme light strikers
Simultaneously saw me killing 85 ciphers
Lethal as gas, teach writing remedial class
For information I'm the man encyclopaedias ask
He wouldn’t let us alone, so instead of his home
Through my competitors dome I flew a predator drone
I paralyze all mobile movements
Voice waves register at 16 million Scoville units
I conceive mental deeds and read infinite symphonies
The length of these would need 23 mile parenthesis
Messages I sent across penetrate brain parts like intercourse
With the force of barbedwire dental floss
What else? concealed under my right wing
Is a hypodermic needle filled with a white beam of lightning
I don’t like to be watched writing
Seeing me compose is more rare than a Sasquatch sighting
The mic don, incomparable writing icon
Who won a constricting contest versus a python
When night comes my trachea turns into a pipe bomb
And when I’m done I always get dough like taekwon'
The outer realm ain't safe enough
I'll make a one inch paper cut that bleeds so much
They'll use a cape to tape you up
I'm not a thermometer I'm a thermostat
Meaning whatever condition I determine that
Time resetter, I'll probably read better
Cause my alphabet has 293 letters
I'm killing all participants, I write with a nitroglycerin
Scud missile pen that was shipped in from Switzerland
I had it built in the past life while visiting
Got it in this life because it took a thousand years to send
With hundreds and hundreds of rhymes, water torture styles
Dropping lines on your head one at a time
To climb to these heights I've earned the right
Your skills don’t exist like nocturnal light
From the temple of immortal bliss
I'll hit you in the farthest pits of space with cylindrical coordinates
I study in the darkest tints, and offer hints of cognizance
That crush volumes of known scholarly arguments
Sounds tranquilizing you, slowing you down
It takes a week for your whole body to go to the ground
I float in the air with a non benevolent stare
I don’t clean the crime scene I leave the evidence there
My counter move is too insurmountable
I'll shrink down through the ground just to go through your ear and rhyme my way out of you
My deep speeches gut and bleeds you in about a minute
Freezes you and leaves you on the outside of the outer limits
Part of your exam's a rap flow cardiogram
Once your heart is scanned my Vietnam slaughter your fam
So the day the skill apocalypse drops
I reach into the sky and grip locks of time and put in zip locks
I think it's such a great far-fetched speed
That architecturally the rhyme would resemble a quasar jet ski
And although the masses don’t yet see that I’m the best there'll ever be
Their narcolepsy doesn’t affect me
I shake jaws and legislate laws
Create great walls all in the first 8 bars
Lock you in my brain wall with no escape clause
Fast paced celestial stars I make pause
Your company was subconsciously executed wonderfully
Honestly I’m so elevated that up is under me
In a secret combine I got multiple brains on a vine
So I’m not lying if I tell you that I changed my mind
Part of me would love to three quarter you bodily
First targeted and blocking off both your carotid arteries
My tongue embodies many properties
It becomes an isosceles sharp enough to chop 43 forest trees
You wasn’t biodegradable so I made a few samples
To serve plates of you to large groups like catered food
I'm the real deal cause I held the letter in my hand
While the envelope that it was in was still sealed
The world stunned by the true perihelion
When my brain hits an orbit point nearest to the Sun
The disproportionate word contortionist
That startled the father of this garbage and leave his verse in an orphanage
Multilingual styles I bring you
Bury you so deep that you'll be on top on the ground in Chengdu
My thought rays stays on all day
A 94 page tornado bar spray that sautées your larvae
I'll make every letter hit ya
If a picture's worth a thousand words watch me take the words and paint a better picture
Through my mastery of alchemy
And without using hands I'll telepathically dangle you from a balcony
The slaughter takes place with no camera or recorder
So there's no one to report what happened to the reporter
My path evolves far beyond geographic laws
We travel stars having wars with rapid avatars
Warp speed drive I can beat it at a jog
For every 24 bars you write I write a catalogue
Layers upon layers, I don’t wear throw backs
I wear throw forwards with the names of unborn players
The threat signed check got a varicose effect
I got a 360 subterranean periscope neck
With a high tech optical set
In a lens that views and detects all microscopical objects
My narratives avalanche and bury the area
My pen's a plasmodium malaria carrier
Violent storms tempest like energy, men surrendering willingly
Got banned from my own training facility
To perish mentally is the penalty
The wind in me is 10 times colder than an Antarctica winter be
Your legacy will swim in the infamy
That stems from a criminal activity of an MC offending me
They denigrate my speeches and similes
But get caught up in the freeze of the spiral vortex killing spree",https://genius.com/K-rino-spiral-vortex-lyrics
Alien Baby,Alien Baby,2011.0,"OK, if you'll all gather around and be real good
I'll tell you the story about the alien child
And how he came to be on this planet here with us
Listen...

Way off in the galaxy, far away
There was a planet in dissaray and total dismay
A sinister circumstance and a retched display
The population terrorized by a killer named K
The wisdom of the whole world was kept in a book
For only the King to read, no others could look
K snuck into the castle, took a leak on the lawn
Before anyone could respond, he and the book was gone
Took it to a cave at an unreachable height
Memorized 3,000 pages in only one night
The light came on, rays shot from his face
He had aquired the ability to conquer the place
He wasted no time, ravaging life with his hand
Overthrew the world rulers and took over the land
With every second that he studied it, his power increased
And all he kept saying was, ""This book is a beast""

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh
It's the alien baby, baby

His reign had lasted two centuries and then
A secret congregation developed among men
One guy said, ""Think as hard as you can
So we can come up with a plan to get rid of this man""
A lady walked in before the plotting could start
""Y'all have seemed to forgotten the most monotonous part""
She said, ""He's bound to put an end to you gossiping men
Don't you know he's got the book, you can't possibly win""
The meeting ajourned, everybody sadly moved on
The lady left and transformed, it was K all along
But an old man walked up with plans for the task
He said, ""There's one thing K doesn't know that this book has
A pamphlet consisting of only one page
With the power to disengage evil at any stage""
They said, ""If that book is real, he already killed it""
The man opened up his coat and light beamed and he revealed it

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh
It's the alien baby, baby

Heavens to Murgatroyd, what the Hell, lo and behold
When he opened the book wind started blowing in cold
He started chanting, ""Yay yay yay yay"", a language unknown
Then his voice lowered deeper to a dangerous tone
He was summoning the book's destruction for an hour
A guy stood skeptical and doubted his power
As the doubter thought, ""All of this is fake"" in his mind
The man looked right at him, told him, ""No it's not and kept trying
He collapsed, he woke and said, ""The planet is saved
If you looking to find K, he's out cold in a cave""
Soldiers rushed up to capture him, bombarded the entrance
Starving for vengeance, but all they saw was an infant
They said, ""He got away, the planet's in trouble""
""No he didn't, he's the baby in the oblong shuttle
Sentence to start over, be no kindred of you
And there's a planet called Earth that we're sending him to""
The little shuttle was propelled through the darkness of space
Past lightspeed, sped at a remarkable pace
Like a meteor it hit the ground and shook up the land
In South Park they found a baby with the book in his hand

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-oooooh, ooh-ooh-ooooh
It's the alien baby, baby",https://genius.com/K-rino-alien-baby-lyrics
Top of the Hill,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"Still sittin' at the top of the hill
Just to show we still do it like we do it
]
Two seconds after you hate me, I'm all in yo' face
K-Rino is harder to beat than a dope case
I'm moving faster than you do at my slow pace
I thought your tongue was chopped out cause you got no taste
A year of practice couldn't keep you out the loser bracket
The only game that you can beat me at is who's the wackest
I'ma keep bringing this heat til my bread's deep
Once I kill the track, it's just like ya daddy, you're dead beat
What made you think that you could duplicate my whole verse
He so stupid he was on second and stole first
I froze jerks with 20 below cold bursts
Take off my belt and whoop your ass until your soul hurts
Don't let me catch you with your chest exposed
My lyrics are more colourful than Westbrook's clothes
What you flow is so worthless like a ring with no rocks in it
My work is timeless like a house with no clocks in it
To come against me, man, you know that he wrong
That's like tryna send a text message on a Rotary phone
You sounding weak I don't need you in my circle, you a clown to me
You like my upstairs neighbour, you ain't down with me
A nice dude in real life but on the mic feared
My rap style's dirty and rough like your wife's beard
Trusting you to write some heat would be very hard
I'd rather trust a dope fiend with my credit card
I'm an impossible deep topical obstacle
I even study weak rappers so I can know what not to do
I heard about his feminine ways just from word of mouth
Punched him in his sternum and some breast milk squirted out
That's what you get for all the tripping and casting suspicion
Give you more problems than a pissed off mathematician
You put me in a bad mood when you perform
The doctors and the nurses even booed when you was born
What's up now, you was talking now you copping out
I glued your lips to your eyes and make you watch your mouth
Repeat what I said, that's heat to your head
You'll be trying to recover like changing the sheets on the bed
Started to give you some advice but I'll just keep it instead
I went so hard when I was through, the Grim Reaper was dead
I laugh when you say you gangster, not the way you bust
Like weak songs on the radio; you play too much
What you said was kind of lame that's why you didn't wanna claim
I must need to be potty trained cause I keep shitting on the game
Been laying low but my dominance is fast emerging
I'm the best and you gon' have to face it like a plastic surgeon
I hurt shows, murk foes with my worst flows
I stay laying rappers out like they were church clothes
I walk 'em down like dirt roads till they flatline
Our shows was at the same time but your people was at mine
The day I came into the game, that's when it got live
I bet that you ain't even in your own top five
Every clown on your record label was left for dead
Stomped these rappers in the dome twice, I'm two steps ahead
I take your card, bread and drive all paid
He was walking home mad, he has side-walk rage
My hands red, call me K-Rino, the human ant bed
I run my foot straight through ya like a pants leg
You said you'll fix it so I'll never get loot
I'ma make you swallow those words like alphabet soup, now
Might wanna hide till the problems get rectified
I'll step your ass to the side like the electric slide
The boldest lyric, I'm sure to spit it
I'm cold enough to throw myself a surprise party and not know I did it
I'll piledrive ya through the dirt, you'll never resurface
You're worthless, you couldn't even afford my free verses
You wanna talk and slander
Better keep that shit to yourself like a baby wearing a pamper
Need to change your wardrobe fool and dumb your dancer
Before they jam your whole album, they'd rather bump my sampler
Trick, where you stay, text me your address, we can go today
Your best work can't match the songs that I throw away
Let's get it on and I'ma spank your like your father do
I would say ""Loser gotta wear a dress"" but that wouldn't bother you",https://genius.com/K-rino-top-of-the-hill-lyrics
From the Heart,Time Traveler,2006.0,"Yeah, we gotta do what we gotta do out here man
Gotta make these streets feed us man
Ain't nobody else gon do it
Boys is out here hungry tryna get it anyway they can
So this what we gon' do, listen

Your boy ain't tryna be the hardest, I'm just tryna be a grown man
Live prosperous, see money and touch it with my own hands
Worship God, help people and don't let life defeat me
Show love and treat people how I would want 'em to treat me
I speak with such deepness, some question my streetness
A mistake if you ever take my kindness for weakness
Hard times I beat that, done took heat and gave heat back
Been drawed on by police and shot at by street cats
Discriminate on no money, nine to five or hood money
The rap game done helped me turn bad money to good money
Done had sex and made love, ran game and played love
But right now, a million dollars couldn't make me trade love
Never sold crack or sold pills, just wisdom and cold skills
But in my city ain't no deals that should jack cars and show grills
And that's backwards, the game is getting faker every year
People base a artist off of what they see, not what they hear

I'm speaking from my heart, homie
I been tryna keep it straight up from the start, homie
But these evil forces ripping me apart, homie
I'm tryna make people appreciate my art, homie
I'm in this world still tryna find my way, man
Still patiently waiting on my day, man
But I'm running out of good things to say, man
And suicide ain't a option so I pray, man
That's what it is dude

Reality I sip from, you want some, come get some
They say K you ought not rap so much about the Nation of Islam
But kill that, the N.O.I. backs me and I back them
And they don't print enough money to make your boy attack them
You want me, you take my subject matter like I leave it
Me sell out for a record deal? I can't even conceive it
Life ain't all about the money, love of money's our opponent
If my ties to Islam block me from a deal, then I don't want it
Whether radio or industry, you fake, I'ma attack y'all
You can't blackball a man that's already been blackballed
All states get slapped on, punks with bra straps on
And I ain't no studio gangster, tryna hide behind a rap song
In the park you gotta fight, you a mark get out of sight
Your bark's worse than your bite, what's in the dark come to the light
Must be crazy if you think that I would ever fear another man
The mic be in my left, the murder weapon in my other hand
And none of these stuck up left females, I been tied
Yeah girl you look good, but you a monster on the inside
Messed up in the head, frustrated and depressed
Thinking what a man is driving is a measure of success


I'm stressed out and rolled down, half my dreams to' down
And 85 percent of the folks I ever met was low down
No nuts you better grow 'em, got hands learn to throw 'em
And you can hang around a person all your life and still don't know 'em
That's so true, but that's a part of life you gotta go through
Like being poor and working at a job you hate to go to
I guess I start mobbing, I'm hungry tired of starving
My girll running me crazy daily, now I'm tired of arguing
Need something to uplift me, the game is real shift
J-Flex is doing thirty years and Pharoah doing fifty
And Aftermath done did ten, my boy Guy did fifteen
And these cakes is out here acting hard, when they softer than whipped cream
My enemies unjustly, tell lies when they discuss me
You shocked because I never trusted you, I barely trust me
Can't touch me, you out there everyday, I'm kinda rusty
Say you ain't jealous the way my name is in your mouth, you must be",https://genius.com/K-rino-from-the-heart-lyrics
Flat Vs Globe,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Once again we'd like to thank you for attending this event
Please have a seat and settle in, we're about to begin
In debates over this topic, we're seeing an influx
So instead of wasting time lets get right down to the crux
Now traditionally, we've all been taught for many years
That this planet Earth that we're living on is just a sphere
The panelist to my right will attempt to prove that
While the panelist to my left will try to prove that it's flat
OK you first
Well anyone with common sense will know
That in actuality the Earth can only be a globe
This theory of a flat planet is just a fabrication
There's years of documented ship circumnavigation
You liars came along and eliminated the truth
The ancient scholars have all demonstrated the proof
We have days, nights, time zones that happen as we spun
Verifying that we're absolutely circling the Sun
We're not circling the Sun, the Sun's above us, they lie
Day and night is a result of it moving from side to side
The principles of how are not hard to uncover
When it's shining on one side, there's darkness on the other
The Sun's 93 million miles away
No, it's not, it's closer and smaller than what they taught you and not as hot
No revolving, in an upward direction we propel
The Sun sits over the flat Earth and the Moon does as well
What the hell, you're speaking so miscellaneously
Where's the evidence to back the way that you claim it to be?
So I need you to explain this to me
If the Sun's above a flat Earth, we should all see it simultaneously
OK, OK, next question, you can both issue your case
If the Earth is flat, explain the globe pictures from space
There's satellites that take shots and photos of capture
Those are fake computer generated images from NASA
They've lied on many things for the illusion of advancing
And please don't even get me started on that Moon landing
The pictures keep changing so it's obvious they did it
If you research their documents about it, they'll admit it
They covered up the truth for years, believe it or not
It's all just a fake government engineered plot
Well I have a question since NASA is our space station
It's location's in the US, what about the other nations?
See, many countries have space programs that excel
And they all have pictures of a globe Earth as well
You're failing to see this thing as a collective endeavor
'Cause you don't believe that other countries conspire together
If the Earth is flat, couldn't you go to the edge and fall?
No sir, the edge is blocked by the Antarctica wall
There's a block of ice surrounding the planet, totally froze
And this is the barrier that keeps everything enclosed
The government's of the world know, all of them are in it
And it's strange how that part of the planet is off limits
Alright back to the globe guy present your next claim
Yes sir, I've seen the curvature of Earth while on a plane
It's the same with an astronaut
No, with all due respect
That curve you think you see is called the Fishbowl Effect
That window was probably convexed and round too
So naturally the surface seems curved when you look through
And another thing that I would like to easily disprove
If the Earth is spinning so fast, why don't we feel it move?
Well I'm not surprised that that's a point that you'd rationalize
And not take into account the Earth is massive in size
And moving at a steady rate of speed that stays the same
So the movement isn't felt unless the miles per hour change
That's insane, we'd fly off of the planet spinning around
And please don't try to say that the gravity keeps us down
Gravity's a nonexistent force that can't be grasped clearly
The physiological function of it is only theory
So the concept is alive, there's no pull on the tides
We live on the top, there's no one on the bottom or the sides
There's a question upon which I'd like my counterpart to expound
How come just the Earth is flat and the other planets are round?
Mars, Neptune, Jupiter, Venus, even the Sun
'cause a telescope can clearly show the shape of each one
Please explain the traveling over horizons by ships
And the curved shadow on the Moon in a lunar eclipse
Yo, one question at a time, bro, you hoggin' the mic
Flat Earth guy, the floor is yours, take as long as you'd like
Well, your horizon question, I'll answer it in an instant
The ship's disappearance is all a matter of distance
And as for the lunar eclipse is an easy battle
The circular form of the Moon dictates the shadow
So no matter what the shape of the object that's hovering
It's shadow takes the form of the object it's covering
And as for other planets being round, that's a no-go
What you see in your telescope is different from the NASA photos
OK, that's it, it's over, no more time left to debate this
We're glad that both of you were able to present your cases
So let me give my point of view before we close out
Flat or globe, it's more important things in life to worry about",https://genius.com/K-rino-flat-vs-globe-lyrics
Letter to the Law,The Maven,2013.0,"I can't believe people say you a hater
Just because we called for help and you came an hour later
Maybe you was extra busy stoppin' criminal acts
Some even said you pull people over because they black
All of y'all are doin' great jobs keepin' your scope on us
And I refuse to believe you would plant some dope on us
They had to be wrong if you busted in their residence
They even lied and said you created fictional evidence
I gotta commend how you handle situations
Shot a youngsta', beat his mama and got a paid vacation
I know it's hard bein' you, so why would they question?
And everything you do, we know it's all for our protection
Passin' through our neighborhoods spyin' at night
Some consider it harassment and denyin' our rights (Not me)
You had to have a good reason for attemptin' to hurt us
Cause I know that ya'll would never ever do it on purpose

Dear Mr. Policeman
Why is everybody trippin'? I just don't understand
I know you out here in the streets doin' the best that you can
If I could meet you face to face, I would shake your hand
Dear Mr. Policeman
Why is everybody trippin'? I just don't understand
I know you out here in the streets doin' the best that you can
If I could meet you face to face, I would shake your hand

Dear Mr. Policeman
Them tickets you wrote for me costed over a grand
Didn't think that I was speeding, but you got me because
And since I know you wouldn't tell a lie, I guess that I was
Kinda strugglin' so to not pay 'em is threatenin' my freedom
Thanks for showin' up at court to make sure I didn't beat 'em
And we don't make it easy when we see y'all comin'
Instead of just lettin' you beat us we be strugglin' and runnin'
I know you hate it when we make you have to use that stick
And by the way, that taser and that pepper spray did the trick
I'm still walkin' funny, hope my vision kicks back in
I know that I was wrong sir I'll never J-Walk again
Somebody told me you was jealous cause that car was brand new
I said, The police jealous? that could never be true
Maybe one day I can be as clever as you
You care about us, so you monitor whatever we do
(Hah)

Dear Mr. Policeman
Why is everybody trippin'? I just don't understand
I know you out here in the streets doin' the best that you can
If I could meet you face to face, I would shake your hand
Dear Mr. Policeman
Why is everybody trippin'? I just don't understand
I know you out here in the streets doin' the best that you can
If I could meet you face to face, I would shake your hand

Pardon me Mr. Policeman
These cuffs are cuttin' off the blood flow to my hands
It's amazing how you kicked that dude all in his face
And beat the case even though they had it all on tape
I know you love the people in the hood, how could you fake it?
And that missing drug money, I know you didn't take it
I don't understand why people accuse you of hate
I know you only follow us to make sure that we're safe
I saw 9 of ya'll against 1, beatin' 'em brainless
That 65 year old woman must've really been dangerous
Cleanin' up the streets is your top priority
You qualified for this, why would we question your authority?
You only workin' hard, followin' and trainin'
Why the hell all the Mexicans and Blacks complainin'?
You gotta be the closest thing I've seen to perfect
And everybody that you locked up, they had to deserve it
(Yeah)

Dear Mr. Policeman
Why is everybody trippin'? I just don't understand
I know you out here in the streets doin' the best that you can
If I could meet you face to face, I would shake your hand

Doin’ Bad,The Hit List,2004.0,"What's up homey, long time no see, man
Yeah i'm chilling man, how you been doing?
That's good, good to see you, you looking good
How your mama been doing?
Real good man, tell her I said ""Hi"" man
Got much love to y'all, stay up all right, yeah

Man I'm doing bad, I'ma come real with it
It ain't struggle that make a man, it's how the man deal with it
Last days you gotta recognize the negative ways and turn from 'em
We all make mistakes G but the key is to learn from 'em
I've been blessed to come across a little paper
Made a lick and spent it quick then had lost a little paper
Appreciating what we got, we true hood scholars
Then sat in circles with my partners, pitching in change to scrape for 5 dollars
When ya leave home the world change all of a sudden
Full grown, you on your own partner, the world don't owe you nothing
I'm in this hole ducking and dodging the Grim Reaper
But the more I try to dig my way out it's getting deeper
I'm doin' bad baby

When everything around you is going wrong
(Man, I'm doin' bad up in the hood but I'm still hanging)
And hard times seems to last too long
(I gotta stop all that singing and start swinging)
Your old school homeboys dead and gone
(Man, I'm doin' bad up in the hood but I'm still hanging)
The game don't change keep pushing on
(Feel that, uh)

I'm tryna show love but people take the bad and provoke
If I give this bum a dollar will he eat it or smoke it?
Put speculations to the side and just go out on a limb
I'm visualizing myself one day being just like him
So I focus on my paper, got a mission to rise
And try to see life through the eyes of the poor and despised
'Cause they're my people man, I never turn my back on 'em
To my young hustlers walking these cuts with crack on 'em
It's another way, I hope you're feeling your brother
I know that cash be coming fast, but dog we killin each other
Making bad move, trusting fools, caught up in crosses
And you ain't different from the rest player, we all done took losses
Better shake it off 'cause a real man would accept
Responsibility and play it with the hand he was dealt
See my shrink done even ran out of questions to ask
Plus I'm holding family animosity from the past

When everything around you is going wrong
(We doin' bad up in this hood but I'm still hanging)
And hard times seems to last too long
(Time to stop all that singing and start swinging)
Your old school homeboys dead and gone
(Got my partners on the cut, man they still slanging)
The game don't change keep pushing on
(real out here, uh)

My paper playing out, really ain't too much in my stack
In a Lacc, clutching a gat, my stomach touching my back
The world is testing me, but at the same time my girl's stressing me
My actions be the reason why the Man ain't blessing me
Should I chase mine with skill or a gun on my waist line?
And face time, these questions go deep as a bass line
I'ma take it the whole nine or catch a case trying
Confess my sins hoping that God will erase mine
Gotta raise ya game level when the trouble appears
I got partners I been hanging with for 15 years
Yeah, I'm strong but I'm worn out and tired in the mind
'Cause water drippin on a rock can wear it down over time
Ya feel me? I ain't a baller, I'm a child of the ditch
Being broke is a test, but money is a trial for the rich
And to the ones that past on, G's we lost in the game
Y'all come to life every time somebody mention ya name

When everything around you is going wrong
(We doin' bad up in this hood but I'm still hanging)
And hard times seems to last too long
(Time to stop all that singing and start swinging)
Your old school homeboys dead and gone
(Got my partners on the cut, man they still slanging)
The game don't change keep pushing on
(real out here, uh)

Throw 'em up for ya partner that done past away
Throw 'em up for that baby that was born today
Throw 'em up if ya hustling and making ya pay
Throw 'em up if ya feeling every word I say
It's like that",https://genius.com/K-rino-doin-bad-lyrics
Welcome to the Circus,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"(Oh look Daddy, Daddy, the circus is in town)
Boy let me tell you something
I better not ever catch you at that circus
You understand me boy?

Welcome to the circus, no lions or elephants
Just a bunch of idiot rappers with no intelligence
Locally and out of town, come see stupid by the pound
Might not have no dancing bears, but we got a lot of clowns
You can see 'em all around, way too many fools to name 'em
Catch me in a cage with a chair and a long whip tryna tame 'em
Men in pink gotta walk on glass, little bitty shirt, (?) to the ass
If you wanna visit better come and get a ticket
Hurry up before you miss it cause they're goin' real fast
See 'em close up they so cool, superstars with attitude
Short skirts, too much make-up, blonde wigs and that's the dudes
Is it? Hold up, what the hell? It's much too hard for us to tell
Step right up and see the female who takes her clothes off just to sell
Look at these fools on a mic in a room full of middle school children rapping dirty
On stage with their drawz showing, he's nineteen and that one's thirty
Fake thugs fake pimps, artificial players bawl
Grand finale watch me line them on a wall and spray 'em all

Welcome to the circus where every act is worthless
Cartoonish buffoonish artist music with no purpose
All I see is fakeness passing off as greatness
Followers and clowns sell-outs puppets and agents
Welcome to the circus where no male rapper shirt fits
Cartoonish buffoonish artist music with no purpose
All I see is fakeness passing off as greatness
Followers and clowns sell-outs puppets and agents

All I see is people mindlessly actin' like who they tryna be
Signin' these dotted lines a be blindly draped in dishonesty
I'ma give them what they askin' for when he can pass my door
Get outta pocket I'ma blast for sho'
I got a quick temperaments with a bottle of no tolerance
Name's anonymous with astonishing flow dominance
Stop, think, you don't wanna war with a rapper who can chop a catastrophe in his jaw
When I hear it I'll be gettin' so mad I lose it
He claimin' he better than any then he has to prove it
See me on a street corner with a bag of music
I'm the leader of the anti-swagger movement
It's hard to get a grab coz I'm pass elusive
One minute in Houston, next in Massachusetts
(Parents?) pass fast to his gastric juices
When I blast every ribbon that he has is useless
Got to wreck to put feminine boys in check
No smoke no jury no voice effects
How the hell you comparin' her bets to arrogant men packin' (?) and kept him wearin' a dress
The hood following trends so the youths is damaged
Subliminal low self-esteem seize our planet
While the debt at the degenerate park is piling
The slave master is sitting in his office smiling
His mind is deep in a secret he won't tell
Ever wonder why the conscience artist don't sell?
Spiritual resurrection is what they fear
So when it comes to what I be thinking they must stay clear
They only release songs that corrupt their ear
Looking at people become products of what they hear",https://genius.com/K-rino-welcome-to-the-circus-lyrics

Flow Session Resurrection, bars I'm giving birth to
It's time for me to go in now like I got a curfew
When K-Rino is played it's like somebody throw grenades
I took some time off now I'm back like a shoulder blade
I'm known to cut MCs from South Park to Tuscany
I'm like a rubber these suckers don't wanna fuck with me
K's the master scholars like to test him while he works
You trying but ain't nothing popping like when Miley twerks
I'm in the middle off the controversy when it's starting
You're just a bum I'm first class, like kindergarten
You say you're dating models boy that ain't your true persona
I seen your girlfriend, she look like Honey Boo Boo mama
It's show time, watch me drop another dope line
I'm so crazy I'm about to lose yo mind
Not deep enough for me to spit with ya
Like a batter facing Randy Johnson, fool I'm looking at the big picture
You need to focus on your own team before you say the wrong thing
Get your face cracked just like a phone screen
You had your chances, time for K to prevail now
Rap crowns get took everyday like hotel towels
It's like they catching trains the way they taking L's now
Gave him two Double-Us and he still couldn't spell 'WoW'
A merciless, when I get you it's time to lay down
I wouldn't let you slide if we was at the playground
I'm unearthing the turf when I start conversing
Commit triple homicide on only one person
Smashing K, don't even dream of that
It was fourteen of them and one of me, they had the nerve to say my team was stacked
I hit up every street and drop raw verses
You see me in the hood everyday like knock-off purses
Yeah, I make so many songs I have to give my pen a jump
If I write one hundred and ten a month that usually means I'm in a slump
I'm the greatest and most of these slacking rappers hate it
Backwards reaction he ducked after he got decapitated
If you thinking of coming at me I'm a get ya good
I treat you just like a carpenter coz I wish you would
Sixty seconds of me spitting that's a clever minute
I always thought outside the box coz I was never in it
I teach sound to weak clowns, for me to pull a thought from the top shelf of knowledge I got to reach down
My talent's eternal I'm stuck with it like a needle
I don't make my first impression till the fifth time I see you
I'm starting trouble with you for asking sarcastic questions
Purposely took your words the wrong way like bad directions
It doesn't matter what you try to do
I formed your existence in a dream so I'll just wake up when I'm tired of you
I smoke artists, suffocate frauds and left them coughing
So anti-social I don't hang around myself too often
No interruptions just chill and let me rock out man
I'm sneaking up on my shadow playing a knock out game
When I preform, every song and every hook will get ya
The crowd will be yelling ""One More"" like we just took a picture
I run my mouth until I get kicked out
If opportunity don't knock on my door I'll go to his house
You say you gangster connected sitting between the bosses
Yeah you a made-man, only coz you're cleaning houses
I'm real cool but the right conditions will excite me
So mad, my anger management counselor tried to fight me
My recitation leave fire shooting from your ears
It's lonely at the top and I ain't seen no one in years
Every detractor K is sending them back
My panic attacks look the same as when I'm relaxed
Hit the street and start speaking and spitting with Ali combo speed
You say you're real but you fake as a Monsanto seed
You fell off years ago but I'm the type to last
Make me mad, I'm on that ass like diaper-rash
I can't trust what you saying coz I know it's a racket
That's like a suicide bomber saying ""Hold my jacket""
Thinking that I wouldn't hurt you, that's an error man
Even when I'm sitting down I'm a let you know just where I stand
You wanna make it to greatness you gotta have a patience
With every phrase I got charged tripping like a travel agent
I heat up then quickly erupt then split you up
Just like the property of married couples with no prenup
The things I recall left geniuses floored
When I bring tho the board makes atheists scream for the lord
Yeah, that's it

Flow session resurrection
Y'all thought it was over huh?
Well it might be, or it might not be
Or it might really be this time
Or it might not be

You Ain’t Real,K-Rino,1998.0,"I been busting rhymes since '84
And motherfuckers got the nerve to ask me to do a free show
Ain't that a Bitch with a capital B
If I rap it'll be for pay here on out, never free
This ain't the day for being fraud
Every fool that got a tape out in the rap game be swearing up and down they hard
The most pimpiness, the most mackiness
Pushing most ki's, hardest nigga, most jackiness
I used to have a lot of partners in the game
Till a struggle came and just like a women, it make a man change
You need to quit being fake and illegitimate
Don't be asking me how many tapes I sold if you ain't buy my shit
Stepping to K-Rino, lips in a straight pucker
Little sweet potato pie ass motherfuckers
The game you running boy gon' get you straight killed or hurt
Tryna cap when you know we both broke as dirt

'Cause you ain't real, motherfucker, you ain't real
Popping all that weak shit, thinking you got skill (you ain't real)
You ain't real, motherfucker, you ain't real
Claiming you the man when you out there in the field

I ain't no gangster but sometimes I fuck around with 'em
But every homeboy that I roll with, they know that I'll get down with 'em
I spit my trash going deep from the past flowing
I'm tired of girls walking around with they ass showing
The cash growing, getting dollars shoved up your crack
Half them fools get a dance and snatch their paper back
Next day she waiting for the bus, on the cut, check it
17 years old, dancing out there butt naked
Disrespected, unprotected, think you're built to last?
Same crusty little panties on your filthy ass
Talking about you want a good man, you lying there
At the motherfucking flea market buying hair
Getting ready to hit the club at 12 o'clock mid
Calling around tryna find somebody to keep your kids
Got a another on the way, still smoking blunts
Pregnant than a motherfucker, in the club at seven months

'Cause you ain't real, little mama, you ain't real
Hopping your ass in every car that pass, you better chill
You ain't real, you ain't real, little mama, you ain't real
Fake eyes, fake hair, fake nails, fake grill

I used to tell my little homeboy, ""Don't run with them fools
Ain't nothing but murder in them streets, why don't you go and go to school""
Broke down all the drama that they gave K-Rino
How they showed my album cover on that cop killing show
How ourself and the government keep holding us back
How them punkass perpetrating hoes invented that crack
How a black man'll sell is soul once he get rich
How we fuck over a women and then call her a bitch
North Side against the South Side, leave it alone
Killing each other over land that we don't even own
Understand that's the plan, I'm tired of saying that shit
I'm smoking this, I'm smoking that, why the radio playing that shit?
I try to do right but tonight I might as well blast
Let the preacher give the sermon while he sing for your ass
And when I click on these haters, all the laughing gonna stop
Pop pop, pop pop pop, till the whole world drop
'Cause you ain't real

You ain't real, motherfucker, you ain't real
Tryna buy some Jordan's with a 20 dollar bill (you ain't real)
You ain't real, motherfucker, you ain't real
Claiming you my homeboy, but trick, I know the deal (you ain't real)",https://genius.com/K-rino-you-aint-real-lyrics
Identity Theft,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Get a load of this
Another day in the life

As I stepped on the block, pressure closing in closer
I saw a pole with my picture on a ""Most Wanted"" poster
Accusing me of murder, an inaccurate quote
Oh, I get it, someone's trying to play a practical joke
Just as soon as I approached and started snatching it down
I got a call that said that they were plastered all over town
I said, ""I guess I better get somewhere and figure this out""
This whole chain of events triggered more inquisitive doubt
I showed up at my girl's house that evening, she was steaming mad
Accusing me of sneaking out and scheming
Immediately told me I've been cheating
Then pulled out a picture of me and the lady at a table eating
I vehemently refused to claim it
But looking at myself on the photo it was hard to explain it
She tried to get a confession out of me
But it was obviously a doctored up product of computer technology
I thought of explanations I could maybe explore
But in my heart I knew I'd never seen that lady before
Though I knew it wasn't me I was confused and depleted
Snatched the picture out her hand and to the room I retreated
I laid across the bed deep thinking and breathing
Am I dreaming? Is it real or is my sanity leaving?
News man on the television tripled my load
Speaking of a fugitive but it was me that they showed
Now I'm questioning reality, I'm dazed and confused
First the poster, then the picture, now my face on the news!?
Went outside again and ran into my man on the block
Instead of dapping he approached me with his hand on his Glock
He said, ""I see the real you is now revealing at last
You got the nerve to come around me after stealing my stash""
I said, ""Man, what you talking about? You gotta be sick!""
He said, ""How did you change clothes and hide the product so quick?
It would of been impossible for you to jack and attack me
On foot, then beat me back when I'm driving."" I said, ""Exactly
Something's going on. It wasn't me, man
I've been blamed for 4 stunts in a three hour span""
He said, ""But it was you, same face, same height, slim.""
I said, ""Well, let's go back to where you last saw me, I mean 'him'
I mean.... Let's just go, please help me look for him""
Before we even took a step I looked behind me and saw him
Didn't have to chase him, he was coming in our direction
As I faced him, he mimicked my every move to perfection
He had replicated my physical down to the letter
And I'd have thought it was me too if I didn't know better
I asked him of his purpose, when he said it I knew it
A parallel universe opened up and he came through it
""So, you committed all those acts while wearing my shoes
Buy why me out of six billion others to choose?""
He said, ""Why not? Out of six billion brains to test
A thorough analytic study proved that yours was the best
Everybody was impressed and that included me too
I decided to come to your universe and be you""
I told him, ""I wasn't looking for a war in the least
I don't have a problem with you, man I'm all about peace
It makes no sense to do evil under my image and name
You'll get the blame."" He said, ""Not after I alter their brains""
I lunged out at him on the ground, we started to roll
When we separated we were wearing identical clothes
Now my partner was confused straight bewildered and froze
We both know the fake one goes once the real one is chose
When the people came they knew that I had been framed
They saw two K-Rinos looking exactly the same
He knew everything that I knew or ever conceived
And told my mother if she picked the real one he would leave
She looked in our eyes then deep in our souls
Said, ""I know my son anywhere the fake is exposed""
At that moment a portal opened up in the sky
The other K was sucked through it and people started to cry
Tears of joy for the victory of dodging his wrath
But when they looked at me they heard only a sinister laugh
Right then the scenario was understood quick
It was me that got removed the whole thing was a trick
I was in another realm by the time they discovered
He had staged the process and put a spell on my mother
As for me, I'm now trapped in a place you couldn't fathom
How will I make it back? Stay tuned, I'll tell you next album",https://genius.com/K-rino-identity-theft-lyrics
Don’t Leave Me,Alien Baby,2011.0,"Follow me, y'all want me to sing a Negro spiritual
M-hmm-m-hmmm - 4x

I'm standing in the light but the darkness overcrowded me
Guilt undoubtedly is tryna eat it's way up out of me
I'm imbalanced spiritually, psychologically cosmically
What you looking at is real, no trick photography
See I got a lot of sins, weighing on my consciousness
Knowing all my faults, makes me uncomfortable with compliments
Still daily I pray to win, mental roof caving in
Laboring to shake all the bad behavior I'm bathing in
Every devil with satanic knowledge, I'm denouncing em
Cause when it counts, I can't benefit a ounce from your counselling
My visions rain, from giant pictures to wallet frames
Got a list aside of thangs, that I wish that I could change
My mind is stuck in the past, no hope there to be fed
Cause I can't turn the channel, like the remote battery's dead
And out my heart I can't tune it although it's been years
Since I consumed it, it looms, and my soul is still wounded

Lord I'm trying, so please don't leave me
I plan on changing but, it's not easy
If I start walking to you, I know you'll meet me
I, can't let the forces of this world defeat me
(m-hmm-m-hmmm - 4x)

Got knowledge but I'm trifling, I just want my life again
God's the only friend you got, why the hell you fighting him
Chasing all these earthly things, my standards I set em low
The stuff I lust it never gave me jack, but I won't let em go
My past it be harassing me, I try to magically
Trash it but it recasts itself, with perfect accuracy
Confession, passive aggression
Is life daily past pre-destined, or left in our hands is the question
Whatever made you pursue me, please don't give those praises to me
I'm a foolish vessel, blessed to have the most high speaking through me
I'm greatful for whatever way, he might see fit to use me
Giving me the credit, only proves to me you never knew me
To the unperceptive kind, I appear to be blind
Maybe because I think with my heart, and I see with my mind
You looking at a work in progress, not yet solid
One stage is the evolution, this is not the finished product


Thangs seem hopeless, got great frustration
So how can I focus, and chase salvation
When my discipline is not, strong as temptation be
Come in new waves daily, creatively persuading me
Gotta be freed, with the revelation I recieve
To possibly be, an example of what I believe
The road, to accepting my own
It's true that I been hit with a few stones, but how many have I thrown
See my best I gave it, that test I aced it
But I feel like all this news that I'm making, is being wasted
Sadness kicks in, is it worth it my mind wonders
Still I understand, that strength is not always in numbers
I'm almost on empty, it's two doors within me
See one is God's door, and the other is where the sin be
So bring me, to where I'm meant to be through wise counsel
I win with you, but I'm less than nobody without you",https://genius.com/K-rino-dont-leave-me-lyrics
Heaven and Hell,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said to us that Heaven and Hell were not places
They were conditions
You can have your Heaven or your Hell right here now while you on Earth
You don't have to wait for a big day of judgement in the sky to either get Heaven or go to Hell
You live today in the day of judgement
Every decision that you make put you either closer to Heaven or closer to Hell
Is that right?
Good decisions bring us closer to Heaven
Bad decisions bring us closer to Hell

Let's present the case, our whole life we've been faced
With the false misconception that Heaven is a place
That exists beyond space (where?) high up in the sky
And the spirits of the good go there after they die
But really, that lie has deceived us severely
'Cause it's clearly a few obvious holes in that theory
It's foolish, thinking each person I lost and loved dearly
And everyone up there can look down, see me and hear me
The soul leaves the body so any form is spiritual
Yet every description given of Heaven is material
The gates that you enter, every story that's told
Speaks boldly of milk-and-honey and streets made of gold
Young, middle-aged to old, billions of passed souls
This one singular place is somehow able to hold
Generations have added new layers of information
Discrepancies exist on its actual location
Depicted visualizations, but no wheres or hows
If you ask someone where is Heaven, they'll point up to the clouds
But that concept is something that physics won't allow
If you don't know what I mean, I'll explain to you now
See the Earth been out in the Universe since it begun
And as it rotates, it also makes trips around the Sun
So if you stand up and point into space
Do it again in twelve hours, you'll be pointing to whole other place
The planet's moving so listen to this
What you thought was up is down now because the Earth's position is switched
The enemy tricked us and made us to bow
Told us we would have our Heaven later while he was enjoying his now
So the question that I'm posing is 'Why?'
If Heaven's better than where we are, how come nobody's rushing to die?
'Cause when you die, it's over, no life replacement to give
You resist gravity 'cause it's in your nature to live, yeah

Where is Heaven? Where is Hell?
How many people you know have came back to tell?
For truth to come, you have to gain facts as well
The myth they told then is the same that prevails

When they teach about Hell, we've always learned
Of a place where the evil people eternally burn
But some people would argue with you greatly
That this place that we call Heaven can't be worse than what they experience daily
The preacher used to run the sermon down
And expound on the never-ending flames that existed under the ground
We believed when they told us this place beneath the Earth is
Actually ten times hot as the Sun's surface
But this goes beyond logic's parameters
'Cause the Earth's approximately eight thousand miles in diameter
So how can ten times that much heat be in existence
And not burn the planet from only half that distance?
The whole idea sparks many questions
Why would God let you burn forever off a few years of transgressions?
They say that suicide is the truest way to go to Hell
And though many knew it, somehow they still do it
And no physically dead would be risen
'Cause like Heaven, Hell is a state of being you witness while livin'
And it won't be any bottomless pit to fall in
'Cause Lucifer's Satan and the Devil are all men
Many story lines vary
Some believe that people who died are gonna be raised up from the cemetery
Why would God resurrect all the wicked women and men
Who supposed to be in Hell already and then judge them again?
You feed me falsehood and the purpose was to defect me
You read the scriptures, but you interpret it incorrectly
Concepts taught inaccurately
So for it to actually be, science and nature have to agree

Where is Heaven? Where is Hell?
How many people you know have came back to tell?
For truth to come, you have to gain facts as well
The myth they told then is the same that prevails
(Outro: Brother Nuri Muhammad)
""A baby's born into the world, you're in an emotional Heaven
Someone that you love dies, you in emotional Hell
Am I telling the truth?
If you have the ability to memorize everything you see, you in a mental Heaven
But if you're addicted to crack cocaine, you in a mental Hell
If you're handicapped, you could be in a physical Hell
But if you have full athletic ability, you can be in a physical Heaven
Heaven and Hell are NOT places
They are conditions of life
You been knowing it before a reverend messed you up
You been knowing it before the theological seminary messed him up
They been knowing it before the slave-master messed them up
And the slave-master knew it before Yakub taught him",https://genius.com/K-rino-heaven-and-hell-lyrics
Bass-Ackwards,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Hey, what will be my topic today
Maybe I'll speak on doing normal things the opposite way
I set my alarm after I wake up and then I break out
On my birthday I ate the candles then blew the cake out
I pass information without knowing the source
Right after I got engaged I asked for a divorce
The more I go forward it gets harder to endorse
I took a drink of course and then I lead the water to a horse
A twisted reality within so my mind spins
Parked my car in the drive-through, got out and dined in
I definitely see life from an unnatural perspective
I'm so backwards I'll leave a beep after the message
Some heard that I could educate you with dumb words
I stood on a curb and killed two stones with one bird
The same one I had in my hand while two was in the bush
Standing in front of a door that says pull trying to push
I buy things I can't use, K-Rino is confused
When I get dressed I put my socks on over my shoes
I'm the first dude to ever let a parked car hit him
Pulled up on a hitchhiker got out and walked with him
Money I bet some, I won and kept none
Ran away from home and didn't even live where I left from
In the fast lane I'm slowing up, I eat right after throwing up
I sit around busting balloons before I blow em up
I got in bed and made it up as I laid
I saw the roach already dead and still sprayed him with raid
For the past days I've been taking the strangest approach
I picked up the TV and tried to change the remote
It's getting harder to answer my brains call to order
Ate the rice first, then I got a pot and boiled the water
Don't think that you can comprehend how bad that it's been
Celebrating after I lose and getting mad when I win
And if I ever get heated enough to take a life
I might stab you with a hollow-point and shoot you with a knife
Worked ten years for only 2 minutes a 
I cross-examined the lawyer then I sentenced the judge
My life is like a mirage with my thoughts in a fog
Somebody saw me at the park being walked by a dog
I let my bike catch two flats and then ride it out
I knocked on the door after I was inside the house
I bought a jet without checking how much it costed yet
Worked on a job and every paid day I wrote my boss a check
Point out a street sign to someone blind
I saw a crime, grabbed my phone and dialed 119
Kept giving my bread up even though I rolled a 7
When I'm mad at somebody I tell em to go to Heaven
I get upset at your happiness and laugh at your pain
I don't open up my umbrella 'til after it rains
If you ever want to fight me, I'll ruin your plans
I'll be punching you with my feet and kicking you with my hands
I throw loud parties with gangsters and songs that bang
Then I go beat up my neighbors if they don't complain
I can't play sports 'cause my mind-state's all strange
I tried to gain the first down in a baseball game
I'm sitting in therapy so many hours it's stunning
I bathed outside of the tub while the shower is running
I'm flipping back and forth like raw and war
I pulled up and locked my keys outside of the car
If I couldn't spell somehow my grammar would excel
Was taken to jail for beating the hammer with a nail
When it's cold I'm exposed to the wind when it blows
I don't play my intro 'til the end of my shows
I hit the road and put the car in park when I drove
I cook food in the sink and wash dishes on the stove
I walk the neighborhood borrowing money from bums
They kicked me out the band for playing the guitar on the drums
Any babies in my house pay bills before they grow up
I'll invite you to my party then I won't even show up

Yeah, there's something wrong with me, something wrong with me",https://genius.com/K-rino-bass-ackwards-lyrics
The Experiment,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Has the counsel gathered?
Yes sir, yes sir, we have
What will the new experiment be?
Um, manipulating behavioral patterns of inferior species, sir
Mmm, sounds interesting, is your presentation ready?
Yes it is, yes it is, we have it ready
Please proceed and tell us what you plan to do with this... species
Hahahaha, ok
First we’ll conceive and create them, mold them and shape them
Break them into groups then congregate them and mate them
Let them reproduce and then make offspring and raise them
Oblivious to who truly teaches and educates them, we’ll
Take from the masses and place them in classes
And rate them all based on each’s economical status
Some we will exalt to the highest while the others we’ll let fall
Then we’ll slowly analyze how one’s privilege affects all
We’ll construct a dual system for the poor one and the rich one
And study how they blend and acclimate to their conditions
We’ll divide them into sections and keep sharing this approach
And let the wealth and poverty then measure the characters of both
Provide physical temptation that treats, lures and entices
Create dependencies on our electronic devices
Program and make the man’s fragile psyche indecisive
And watch the nicest ones become savages in a crisis
See each step of this game, for years kept it the same
Present to them a goal in life that they’ll never obtain
Within the range of our power each child will be born
Then, place chemicals in them to see how their bodies respond
We’ll keep the poor that way by denying them a favor
And see how long they take to resort to violent behavior
We’ll subject their generations to uncompensated labor
Enslave them all and make them still love their enslaver
We’ll endanger them and afterwards they’ll call on us to save ‘em
Trust our doctors to cure the sicknesses that we gave ‘em
Make ‘em spend all their days trapped in a unfair maze
Purposely prepare slaves through radio airwaves
Formulate drugs, and then, distribute them through every state
And make conditions that cause them to use them to escape
What if we make ‘em run to evil and see good with reluctance
Make ‘em prioritize the superficial over the substance
Let’s form a secret government to do the really shady acts
Deny people basic human rights to see how they react
Let’s promise them riches if they put their souls on the block
We’ll control all that they listen to and all that they watch
Tamper with frequencies, let’s clone the animals and the food
Give the people faulty medicines just to alter their moods
We can play with human hormones, let’s see where this goes
Wonder what happens when we let women and men switch roles?
Or better yet, switch our bodies, no one’s heard of these things
Gender-bending pharmaceuticals and surgical means
Look at ‘em, greedy and arrogant, relying on phones
Going through life, thinking that they have a mind of their own
We can build weapons for every nation, even the streets
We’ll cause disagreements ’til nobody’s sleeping in peace
I have a question, how can you be sure that this will all work?
It already has, we did it on a planet called Earth",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-experiment-lyrics
Elijah,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"Elijah ain't the dead
The hypocrites' just scared
In due time haha
In due time let me tell you about him

Yeah, straight out of Sandersville, Georgia
The 7th child born to his mother and his father
Grew up in the time of where blacks had rare options
Not even 10 years old, already sharecropping
Working in the field at a real early age
Imagine a child quitting school in the 3rd Grade
There was something special about him, they couldn't comprehend it
He became a man that would transform the course of the planet
Living in the South under racism and evil
From day one he always had a love for black people
Fresh out of slavery, getting real truth was hard
In 1931 he was introduced to God
A man named Fard, came into the picture
Taught him and made him a scholar of math, science and scripture
Plus the mind has shut down what the enemy did
And debunked the lies of who they said the black man is
Elijah


God knew the right person to deposit his message
When Elijah heard the truth he was compelled to accept it
Became a minister of Islam and drew life from it
He was given the name Kareem then later Muhammad
After 3 and a half years, Fard was gone
And Elijah was left to raise the Nation alone
But not really he wasn't alone, quiet as kept
Because Allah still covered him and guided his steps
Then he raised up a Nation who was blessed to come
At a time when black people got oppressed and hung
He taught us to do forself and start begging for rights
Begging to drink from the same water fountain as whites
Cleaned us up from drug using, lying, stealing and cheating
Taught us how to eat to live and how to love our women
And that America was gonna be destroyed and how
And everything he wrote back then, we seeing it now
Elijah


He's not like the scary leaders who consistently front
There's reason he's not mentioned in black history month
Our consciousness went viral since his arrival
You can find him in the Book of Malachi in the Bible
Him and his disciples are all over the Book
You can find him in the Quran if you know where to look
You say you love Muhammad Ali and Malcolm too
But Elijah Muhammad taught them both all they knew
Every words you heard them speak, any wisdom they claim
Matter of fact, who you think gave them both their names
His son Warith Deen, Farrakhan a greatness of them
The spread of Islam in the West, you can trace it to him
In time he made us strong, built schools and farms
Taught us about the mothership, baby planes with bombs
The messenger of Allah sitting at God's side
The exalted Christ and oh by the way, he's still alive",https://genius.com/K-rino-elijah-lyrics
Cut Jugular,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Just lean your throat down
Just lean it down a little
Right there, ok let’s go
Little bit more, little bit more
I can’t get the right angle

Fracture auto-immune systems for crooning all of those wack tunes
The human vacuum that can snatch you from the backroom
Jack the moon and pass it down as a family heirloom
More savage than the offspring of a baboon and a raccoon
 cautions and red alerts, my head will work to make a better verse at well over a million mega-hertz
Gaze into the crystal ball and you’ll see the rage and the vitriol I had when I smashed his face against the wall
Murder so swift I don’t remember it
News travels so quickly that it was on the internet before I finished it
Lieutenant of the printed word syndicate with venom that was meant to heal the sick and the invalid
What listener can resist the type of viciousness that this mouth spits?
Twist you and mix you in a fight until we switch outfits
My power source is in the ocean, it sits afloat
Controlled by a big remote the size of a fishing boat
You wish and hope that I don’t fry your entire infrastructure and really cut ya
The second that you step up to me your Achilles’ ruptures
I sow seeds of animosity that grow anger
My clothes be floating in the closet with no hanger
Plotting revenge, I don’t got to pretend
When I write, shell cases pop outta my pen
I’m an autobot with impressive harder shots in my message
Walking around wearing a live water moccasin necklace
My records got you scared straight as a fed case
Cut through the red tape and make the whole universe jump with a head fake
Running hard fast lines with numbers so gaudy that my hundred yard dash time is faster than my forty
The neighbors be calling in law enforcement to my apartment
When they heard me and my folder at four in the morning arguing
Heinous deranged doctor I’ll watch ya and get my aim proper
Dangerous game-dropper, experimental brain-swapper
Infectious lectures, expressions of dialectic objections
That seizes questions and redirects your perceptions
I free arrested aggression to feed pedestrians thespians with no discretion then add ‘em to my shredding collection
How I produce, I know I couldn’t show you
‘cause I’m even hesitant to approach the quotable regions I go to
The ride through the thought odyssey, the process of cognitive photography
Advance electroencephalography
Elite dominant rhyming anomaly with transformative properties
So I’ll become anyone I decide to be
Words leak from the beat so unbelievably that when I lay
Down for the evening my pillow don’t even want to sleep with me
My classic heat is magically distributed
Head capacity so vast that people asking me to lease it out and live in it
Breaking your good arm, hunting necks to put my foot on
I wear a suit that takes a month and a half to put on
Every moment is surgical, that’s personal
When I get in a certain mood you better start thanking me if I’m hurting you
No clinches or flaws in any part of my text
Because all of my thoughts are preset to auto correct
And it’s crushing, my force is indestructible for disrupting my nuptials, I might run up to you, cussing and throw a truck at you
And you won’t know what to do when I’m busting you
My roughest stuff is used by drug abusing fools as opioid substitutes
Exhibit no sympathy like a killer be born with next degree, artillery eerily swarm peripheries
Rappers insidiously act with duplicity while I sit blissfully listening to the spirits whispering distantly
But if you trigger me, it could be slippery
My prolific written efficiency is strictly god-given, not serendipity
Killing complicitly, critics typically disagree in the middle of
Ripping beats, deliberately switching deliveries, I’m",https://genius.com/K-rino-cut-jugular-lyrics
Once It’s Done,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"There’s no turning back once it’s done
No stopping time when it’s begun
Work your way through problems when they come
Can’t win the battle if you run
Every day is a trip around the Sun
It’s all the same no matter where you from
Doesn’t matter if you’re old or young
There’s enough blessings for everyone

I got the world at my disposal, yet still I remain lonely
I’m a grown man with real struggles and bills in my name, homie
Got some people who think I’m evil, while some others believe I’m holy
I hear more statements about me from folks who don’t even know me
It ain’t hard to lose your mind these days, I’ve seen a lot of men flip
And now I’m seeing ideological differences end friendships
The bond y’all had was busted, the words no longer trusted
And when it’s time to talk, some dudes don’t have the fortitude to discuss it
See I don’t mind receiving correction or internal reflection
From happiness to depression, man I done covered that whole spectrum
And I learned quicker than most men about controlling my explosions
And I do my best to never base decisions off of emotions
With a lifetime full of facts learned and disloyalty that burns
It wasn’t a stranger, it was your boy who got you when your back turned
So how can I keep stepping without going left?
Gotta channel my aggression, okay—well I guess that I just answered my own question

There’s no turning back once it’s done
No stopping time when it’s begun
Work your way through problems when they come
Can’t win the battle if you run
Every day is a trip around the Sun
It’s all the same no matter where you from
Doesn’t matter if you’re old or young
There’s enough blessings for everyone

It ain’t nothing like the power of understanding when it comes
I don’t see the world the same that way I saw it at 21
I was a fool inside a cesspool, hope you listening to me nephew
'Cause what I lived was predestined to rescue, teach and help you
But truth be told, it’s your choice, what you should do or don’t do
It ain’t my place to force you, you can act however you want to
But just know that there’s a consequence, every time you break rules
Don’t jump too fast, always calculate before you make moves
'Cause time is unrewindable, I’m hip to that like no other
I’m tryna lace you up, I made enough mistakes for both of us
And pride will come before the fall, so learn to follow protocol
'Cause most of y’all young people be think that you know it all
And every time we lose one, it’s rough but I don’t show the hurt
There's barely time to mourn the loss, I got to mash and go to work
My past actions haunt me, I’ve gotten over 'em partly
Still I wish I could have met somebody then who would have taught me

There’s no turning back once it’s done
No stopping time when it’s begun
Work your way through problems when they come
Can’t win the battle if you run
Every day is a trip around the Sun
It’s all the same no matter where you from
Doesn’t matter if you’re old or young
There’s enough blessings for everyone

See me an angel, how that sounding? With lakes of guilt I’m drowning
I must be stressing in my sleep because most days I wake up frowning
And the task of daily problem solving got my temple pounding
And it’s not that I’m so serious I'm just tired of all this clowning
I can’t play with you in wartime 'cause you jeopardise what I love
If you a crook, that’s on you, just don't track your dirt on my rug
See when times between two people cease, it’s best to split—go west and east
'Cause separation keeps the peace and you don't want that beast released
I've seen homies from school who knew me back when I knew you
And I tell ‘em, “Yeah, we cool we just don't hang out like we used to”
And each word from my mouth’s true, this really ain’t even about you
It’s just that certain things I used to be into, I outgrew
Some close calls and barely-made-its, other incidents rarely stated
Always hated anytime that side of me got activated
Still in the process—I’m capturing that; the savage in me—I’ma have to attack
‘Cause once it’s on I get trapped in the act and the guilt don't kick in till after the fact

There’s no turning back once it’s done
No stopping time when it’s begun
Work your way through problems when they come
Can’t win the battle if you run
Every day is a trip around the Sun
It’s all the same no matter where you from

If I Had,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"Listen
If I had a son, here's what I'd teach him
Respect everybody that you meet
Got to treat everybody decent
Don't be a coward, be a man with
Patience and understanding
I would be there in your time of need
I would never leave or abandon
Protect you from the rough cruel world
Never let the walls crush you
Encourage you that you can do anything
That you put your mind up to
I would be the type of parent
That would let you know you was priceless
I would be the one to stay up through the night
Even learn how to change diapers
And later on when you're older I'd teach you about hard work
To never disrespect the woman ever
And to always put God first
I'd try to make him the smartest
To be strong yet cautious
I'd teach him 'bout the dirty streets
And how the world sees him as a target
If he wanted somethin and he earned it
I would get it if I could afford it
Anything that he perticipated in
I would be there for him to support him
At times I'ma be hard on him
Let him know how to live and plan good
Give him disipline and knowledge and
Advance as I navigate him into manhood

If I had a son
If I had a daughter
I'd thank God as I work harder
To try to be the best father
I'd raise em to be strong
To be wise and to be smarter
And not fall in a trap set by a world gone out of order
If I had a daughter
If I had a son
I'd teach'em responsibility
And I'd still let'em have fun
I'd give'em both a good name
They would never have to be ashamed
So when they have their own children
One day they'll do the same

If I had a daughter
Everyday I'd be nervous
Scared to let her out my sight
Knowin how treacherous this world is
It would be hard not to spoil her
And treat her like a little princess
To see it everday would be a
Constant reminder that we been blessed
And it wouldn't be no secret
I can't lie I would be strict
Cause these slick fellas gunna be comin at her
Harder the older that she gets
I would try to guide and instruct her
Teach her why she should stay covered
Let her know that she can tell me anything
Good or bad I'ma still love her
And I'ma teach you how these dudes think
And show you how a real man would act
But any female stuff I'ma fall back
And let your momma handle that
I'd pack you around proud
Makin sure that everybody in the world knew
And teach you how to think for yourself
Never do what them other girls do
I'm always here when you need me
And I don't ever have to ask ya why
And any guy that would ever try to violate you
He gunna have to die
Sometimes you gunna be upset
When you wanna go somewhere and I won't let you
But I'm only doin what's best to
Keep you out of trouble and protect you

If I had a son
If I had a daughter
I'd thank God as I work harder
To try to be the best father
I'd raise em to be strong
To be wise and to be smarter
And not fall in a trap set by a world gone out of order

And I'd still let'em have fun
I'd give'em both a good name
They would never have to be ashamed
So when they have their own children
One day they'll do the same

If you got children cherish em
The experience might better you
Cause bringing new life in the world
Is the best thing you could ever do
Don't take frustration out on em
Don't abuse just because you was abused
Cause nine times out of ten
If they turn out bad it was cause of you
Don't bail out when it gets rough
To neglect them is a lose of time
You might not have a bunch of money
But showin love don't cost a dime
Baby momma or baby daddy
Might flip out, might cross the line
But both y'all got a child to raise
So petty beef, get it off your mind
The baby gunna suffer in the end
Understand it's a whole lot to lose
Remember how happy both of y'all was
First day that you got the news
Goin to the doctor together
Ever month checkin how that waist look
Lay around pickin names out
Postin ultrasounds on facebook
You was underneth the same roof
Now she cussing you when you packin up
Tell me how can hate come from something
That was supposed to be a act of love
Y'all get it right, stop actin up
God made it so you oughta be elated
Cause there's people like me who would love to see
My own seed and appreciate it

If I had a son
If I had a daughter
I'd thank God as I work harder
To try to be the best father
I'd raise em to be strong
To be wise and to be smarter
And not fall in a trap set by a world gone out of order

Bad Religion,Mightier Than the Sword,2018,"What's really going?

I'm seating here staring at this preacher, man
Listening to his lies keeping his eyes on his reaching hands
Hoping what he reveals might rebuild life
Although the church is real nice, still something don't feel right
It's like a business, no one smiling, people rushing you
The atmosphere ain't cool, folks tripping, even the usher's rude
The congregation looking raggedy, it's so unfair
Thought I witnessed something else but I ain't even going there
Fall back, let me try to peep on what he preaching on
Said he need to raise a hundred racks before the week is gone
He said the church is tryna purchase a teleprompter
Then he said he needed new propellers for his helicopter
This ain't real man, it's sounding like survival stunts
Been talking an hour, he ain't opened up the Bible once
Meanwhile, 20 directions my eyes going
It's hard to concentrate 'cause Sister Wilson got her thighs showing
She dressed like she at the club, man that's dangerous bruh
And I ain't even blaming her but this ain't what I came in for
How can I keep myself from going all out
When the same things out in the world I see in God's house

So I'm sick of all this bad religion
The reason why the world is in a sad position
The money adding up, they need a mathematician
And that's why all these pastors under mad suspicion
So listen man, I'm sick of all this bad religion
The reason why the world is in a sad position
The money adding up, they need a mathematician
And that's why all these pastors under mad suspicion

They coming after you, they coming after you
They coming after me too
So what are we gonna do?

Selling crack or tryna jack, that will never work
You wanna rich for real, start a mega church
You won't ever have to work hard throughout the week
20,000 people paying ties, boy you about to eat
So many fakes in religion I don't think I can mention
Pay attention these pastors is out here Bible pimping
Joel Osteen be speaking on love
But he left the whole city stuck out during the flood
And he taking your cash, lying and talking fast
Didn't open up his doors until them folks got up on his ass
True indeed, see he don't fool me I can see right through
He just a crooked ass snake and his wife too
Watch what they do, they just lying to get paid
Taking advantage of people, really tryna get saved
We hate to read so we suffer in greed
You don't even know why you believe what you believe

But I'm sick of all this bad religion
The reason why the world is in a sad position
The money adding up, they need a mathematician
And that's why all these pastors under mad suspicion
So listen man, I'm sick of all this bad religion
It's the reason why the world is in a sad position
The money adding up, they need a mathematician
And that's why all these pastors under mad suspicion

Wait a second bro I got one question
You saying if I don't buy this piece of cloth, I won't get a blesssing?
Man y'all hustling for real, you ain't repping the truth
The preast in the confessional booth molesting the youth
Now the closer they get to the room, the closer the doom
Hard to trust the black ministers 'cause most of them coons
If Jesus popped up at the church, he'd be mad at them all
After they fall, probably ask him who was that on the wall
The , shady as hell, they posing, cuz
Imposters lying about who the chosen was
The Jewish scholars know the history but won't tell you
Except the few who know it's true and voluntarily do
Corruption even in the Muslim world, where is this from?
Strapping bombs and blowing people up, that ain't Islam
This don't apply to everybody to think that is inaccurate
'Cause it's not about the name it's about how you practice it

But I'm sick of all this bad religion
The reason why the world is in a sad position
The money adding up, they need a mathematician
And that's why all these pastors under mad suspicion
So listen man, I'm sick of all this bad religion
It's the reason why the world is in a sad position

Imagination,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"I’m a mythical character who was formed in the mind of an ancient ghost
And that ghost was formed in the mind of a wise celestial host
And that host was formed by an angel who appears and disappears
And he was formed in the mind of a child who won’t be born for a 100 years
And that child was formed by a genius who studied and learned well
Who was conceived in the undeveloped cerebellum of a sperm cell
And that sperm cell was ejaculated from a being from outer space
Who was formed in the mind of a king that came from a wicked alien race
And that king was formed in a dream by a marsupial in his pouch
Who was formed in the mind of a young dude smoking cannabis on a couch
And that dude was brought to life inside the mind of a magician
Who was conceived by a man with Alzheimer's who then forgot his own vision
And that man was the mental product of a psychiatrist brain creation
Who was dreamed up in the mind of a comatose hospital patient
And he was thought of by a Siamese twin who shared a brain stem
And the mind of the twin who he was attached to created him
And they were formed in the mind of a scientist who spanned time
A reincarnation of the child that I spoke about in the fourth line
Now before you rewind and try to analyse that part of this verse
He spanned time so he can reincarnate even though he came first
But that scientist was conceived by a pregnant woman in a dark room
And she was formed in the mind of the very baby she was carrying in her womb
And the baby was formed in the mind of a dangerous black widow spider
Who was thought of inside the brain of a deranged poetry writer
And that writer was conjured up in a dream by wise Indian Chief
Formed in the head of a small lizard camouflaged on a green leaf
The lizard came from the brain of a man who can define every word made
Who was formed in the thoughts of an 8 year old student in the third grade
Who was thought of by a clairvoyant with unmatchable brain focus
And unified mental conception of a swarm of mad locust
And that swarm was formed by a medium who spoke to the dead and was legit
Who formed in the mind of the one of the spirits he was communicating with
And that spirit was born in the mind of a man sitting on the couch of a shrink
Conceived by microscopic germ than had no brain to even think
And that germ was formed by two Klan members with hoods over they faces
And they were thought of by a black man who murdered them for being racist
And that man was brought to life inside of the skull of a baby bird
Formed by a man who never read nothing but remembered everything that he heard
And that mad was formed up inside a seed that wouldn’t grow
And everything I said was all formed in the mind of K-Rino",https://genius.com/K-rino-imagination-lyrics
Trouble Road,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"They say time is a measurement of motion
Whose presence is more precious than treasures in the ocean
I'm coasting through the game of life, back to the wall
I'm wide open but my teammates won't pass me the ball
I'm a mixture of bad and good, rain and sunshine
Feeling happiness and sadness at the same time
I'm training in a world where evil is reigning
The main thing I complain about is people complaining
Spirit predators all around me slithering amounts
Snakes no longer in the grass they living in the house
I'm mobbing in this treacherous city that bleeds weapons
'Cause your problems go from zero to sixty in three seconds
Cowards lay in the weeds and invisibly judge me
My name must be Company 'cause Misery Loves me
Oh Allah, shine down on me 'cause you're so bright
Please help me make through these hours where there's no light

I'm cautious and scared as I walk down Trouble Road
Masking my pain trying not to get my cover blown
Fighting to get it right and stay out of that other mode
Eyes on the big prize tryna hit the mother load

I attempt to win it, men got pimped and win it
The first minute that's soul selling was implemented
I'm in need of in hands full of righteous seeds
So I can plant em and eliminate my trifling deeds
Young girls getting lazy the game done flipped
How the hell you shame to work but not a shame to strip?
Lil hustlers on the corner only knowing one way
Acting like the dope game got a full 1K
Boys coming out of prison with corrupted minds
Fool bragging talking bout ""Yeah I just did nine""
Man stop being stupid and increase your grind
Quit glorifying giving that beast your time
Ain't no rehabilitation in this treacherous game
Reason a man into the same hell and expected to change
Even pastors and hustlers are rocking the same
So instead of going to church boys watching the game


The same people think they know it all need rescue
Who are you to try to tell God how to bless you?
It don't matter how you are they going violate
House full of food why you eye-balling my plate?
Trust ain't a word you should mention again
They'll get you while you still friends, pre-empted revenge
You can read, but knowledge is only information
Wisdom is translating that knowledge to application
Some say I follow know man religion's a hoaxes
Imposing on a foolish but they're visions provokes
They persecute God's people crack ignorant jokes
Contributing to the killing of indigenous folks
No calm in the forecast this world is a bomb lit
And make sure you in the same place when the storm hit
No need to feel like hopes out of range
A lot of people want to but don't know how to change
Make a 180 out of 360 because
360's a circle that puts you back where you was

Make yourself comfortable
Lay on this gurney
Let me take you on a journey
Oh, this needle?
Oh, pay no attention to this needle in my hand
Look over there, what's that?

My thoughts write with cause and excitement that sparks lightning
When I start typing EMF monitors start spiking
Raw mic torture officer, forcible strife causer
Human version of a DVR, actual life pauser
Flammable head scanner burning primitive grammar
I see life through the view of a thermal imaging camera
Each word that sits beneath my wigs raw
Bizarre cause under six seconds I fixed a million mixed bars like jigsaws
I turn cyborg when I plug in mic chords
I commence the right scores and absorb growing circular light orbs
My yawns resemble tiger-like roars leave wounds when I fight wars
That look just like infected spider bite soars
When the beats played I participate in phrase relays
My talent's infinite and unlimited, yours is prepaid
I was drafted by a team of space renegades and remade
Got traded after three days due to failure to behave
See, when I drop the bomb you should not respond
That's a mismatch like Brock Lesnar in the octagon with a soccer mom
What I'm reading you is not even new, it was breeded two
Centuries back squeezing the fluid through a timeless feeding tube
My flesh is florescent, my essence perfected
My chest is connected so each lecture's directly ingested
You ain't deep at all, you need to give me a call, I speak through walls
And people fall and seek treatment like they was breathing ethanol
Rap revolution, I'm never neutral to execute you
I'll set a crucial mix of septic juice with your Metamucil
We strike mic hands like Thai pads and ignite strands
Of saliva that's disband organs and glands when the first bite lands
My tribe is hard to describe, I built a ride and glide where eagles fly
But it got denied because it wasn't legalized
Let me advise, I've been energized and revitalized
By a 105 over-sized radioactive fireflies
Beyond DEFCONs the level I'm on
Rip through your lungs like the jaws of a megalodon
Wet you like Evian, that's mileage in my lyrical knowledge
Unidentified objects guided by invisible pilots
Well balanced symmetrical topics I hit your section and shock it
Just like a knife in an electrical socket
My creativity exists in a perpetual pocket
Defying physics flying in multi-directional rockets
I graduated from cerebral school, the same night I received a tool
A golden microphone powered by diesel fuel
My pamphlet sits as a mantlepiece, when it heats it can't decrease
Rap mass transits speak faster than Durant's release
If my message ain't impressing you, I'll make a greater spectacle
Leave Texas and long distance arm wrestle you
For my flow base is hard to locate, I'll pitch eight tons of hate over the plate
I throw knuckle curves that go straight
My right hand never landed, it glanced him
Still caused gigantic canyons, kidnapped aliens for whole planet ransoms
Red beamed your camp till shirts get extremely damp
Then make a clean vamp into a Coke bottle size 'I Dream of Jeannie' lamp
The pyromaniac burning thoughts and brains with arson gains
The smoke that came off the flames departs in pain
Relaxed to the hilt, the raps that I've built
Trigger chaotic variations in the axial tilt
When K's in the mood, I be mic tasing a dude
I won't eat unless there's broken razorblades in the food
Check the evidence, I inject permanent speech impediments
Charge elements of malevolent cyber intelligence
I'm taking part in extreme events
High level experiments that seem intense when team members switch fingerprints
I spoke and tease even dope MCs, my outer body skill I show with ease
While breaking in your house from overseas
Intellect bench-press land masses and then wreck
I trend set and deck rappers with zebra kick chin checks
We leave frauds served like hors d'oeuvres
Cause we speak raw words that hit the ground so hard that the cars swerve",https://genius.com/K-rino-doctor-jack-lyrics

The Flow Session Finale
La la la laaa

He disagreed when I said I'm better than his favourite MC
But then I understood why, because his favourite was me
Yo, my flow is 3 hundred levels higher than my old degree
So now if you say I'm dope, you'll be insulting me
You still claim you a thug, boy you lie hard
I saw them Taylor Swift songs in yo' iPod
I don't need to join you, I got my own clique
I'm spitting rhymes at my house, that means I'm homesick
If you scared go to church, leave the studio
But if you At church and get scared, then where do you go?
My writing talents hit crazy extremes
You write words that a newborn baby could sing
I'm so skilled they wonder ""how long can he last?""
A baby said a camera caught my child whooping a Nanny's ass
No second shot, it's over once I perfect a plot
What I concoct will make the bar exam look like connect the dots
I can't get over all that garbage that you said, cheek
Your style needed changing years ago like ya bed sheets
I make it hard for them, hope for tomorrow is slim
A loanshark paid me back when I borrowed from him
You working hard, but don't believe you coming closer
Rappers wanna see me fall, like when Summer's over
You might doubt, but I'm still running precise routes
Took a picture of a lit room and blew the lights out
The best and most versatile ever, I'm here to announce
My shadow's gone, I deleted his Twitter account
I ain't the dude rappers come in to see
That's like gettin' a hooker pregnant, they don't want it with me
Kill the stage and get the applause, I do it with no flaws
Beat you across the head with these lines, I call 'em crowbars
If I could pass my own level I'd be deadly
But I keep getting better, so it's hard for me to catch me
I'm prolific, still the worst through the lies
Take my ride and I still wouldn't lose my drive
I spit raw, y'all nervous and cautious
I got more ghetto lines than the welfare office
I make the whole nation jump up in jubilation
I get it in real easy, no lubrication (ugh)
I had to let the news leak
You should have named your album 14 days, cause it was too weak
I be saying what I see in the hood, that I'm staying
Write my words on your eyes, so you can see what I'm saying
Where ya team at? How you building up ya power?
When yo' investor only making 8 bucks an hour
He won't buss and he ain't tryna fight either
He got his ass whooped by his woman while he was wearing his wifebeater
I know you shot a slug, but I don't respond to losers
You nothing but a lying cheater, and yo' mom's a cougar
I'm a different G, with special delivery
Strippers see me in the street and start tippin' me
We still at war, while you talk about yo' silly car
You ain't even smart enough to know how dumb you really are
You rap about fake weapons and make fake threats
Your guns remind me of women's bra's, Playtex
Your money never been long, homie. That thought's dead
Girl scout cookie bank account, you got short bread
I got a jab, and you the one I'm giving it to
A woman wouldn't be caught dead living wit'chu
How much would I charge for a paragraph of skill? (How much?)
50 percent of a whole dinner, that's half a meal
Dead end, that's the hood that I'm gonna ride with (Okay)
It makes me wanna throw it up, like a stomach virus
You heard a lotta fools spit a rough page
But my bars are like report cards in the sky, upgrades
Yo' career took a 98 percent drop
You a torn achilles rapper, you went pop
Slip the mic in my vest and I'll do the rest
I'll make my mail move forward like a new address
They ask me why I gotta put them on my murder list
I can't trust 'em like a surgeon with a nervous twitch
Everyday I hear how great I am, honestly
50 compliments a day, and those are just the ones from me
You and me head-to-head, that's a scary picture
Your last 3 albums flopped, like Derek Fisher
I got the kick of a loaded rifle
I wanna keep going, but I'm too tired, like a motorcycle

Once again, K-Rino with another volume of Flow Session
The Flow Session Finale
There will be no more after this one
Who will continue the tradition?
Who will take it to the next level?
Haha, stay tuned and find out
Flow Session Finale",https://genius.com/K-rino-flow-session-finale-lyrics
Flow Session Number 2,Alien Baby,2011.0,"My throat is so rugged I drink lava smoothies
My girl is fly and gangster, she pack Prada Uzis
I'ma take you to the scariest place
I'm high-definition like a dictionary in space
Man, my flow almost murdered your brother
It was a close call like Siamese twins on the phone with each other
I was giving wreck and dominion
Your words don't make sense like a fool tryna get a third second opinion
I'm on my feet, you on your ass, I'm a shower, you a bath
I made a half an hour last for an hour and a half, and then I laugh
I'm so great that the scholars can't comprehend it
You the type to flush the toilet first and then shit
See they don't want to see me live because my set's wreckless
I can read a voicemail and listen to a text message
Once I enter I'm a bless the joint
See I'm a 99 yard touchdown, you just an extra point
Anyone greater than K-Rino, man you got it twisted
You ain't in my class, you not even in my school district
Now it's time for the tears to flow
I stay in the booth like a payphone forty years ago
Studying, I keeps books on my mind
I'm like a fisherman, I got these biters hooked on my lines
Once I had a suicidal opponent
I waited for him to talk him off of the ledge and then I talked him back on it
Let the coach show you how to run the plays, G
I'm so futuristic, my first born raised me
Catch me in whip flesh bowed and get your chest blowed
I'm taking no shorts like a club with a dress code
Put fire under you and permanently slumber you
Attack me and I'll get even like the number two
I got my fiancée a ring worth about fifty
Yeah I went to Jared, but I took a pistol with me

I made it out of every rap war that I was in
I had my 25th birthday when I was 10
Stop dancing I don't wanna see no men shake it
I'll put a cast on your arm and then break it
You so stupid it's a trip, how can you keep it coming?
You thought the human race was a bunch of people running
Watch your mouth I'm not the one in disgust
I'll throw a bus at you for tryna throw me under the bus
Understand, I had to take you out because you ran your mouth
Your style is older than that TV at your granny's house
The DJ wanted five G's you told him ""I can pay it""
I heard your song and gave him five more not to play it
You perpetrating like you from the street, fool please
You never on the block like a center that likes to shoot three's
Y'all rap like little boys they just say they grown
I can't trust you, man, you shady as a payday loan
You walking 'round acting like you undefeatable
And I agree with you, no one can beat you being beatable
How can you play to win messing with a alien?
You stole second base I stole the whole stadium
I'ma get it how I live just to stack bread
Stick you up against the wall like a fat head
When I've decided I'ma get you then it's danger time
A brain transplant couldn't make me change my mind
I smoke beats cause I got a track addiction
You up in Walgreen's trying to get a crack prescription
You keep trying to come at me to no benefit
You like Brett Favre dawg you don't know when to quit
I opened up a can of whoop-ass with no restraints
You open up a ketchup package of soft complaints
I pump rhyme like people pumping iron in a zone blinded
A six-pack on my brain, I guess I'm strong minded
You can lift the planet up and won't nobody clap
But I'm so cold people will pay to watch me take a nap
Defeat me, most men can't
If you try it I'm a be up in yo ass like a hip implant
Check me out; I got something for the people to see
When it comes to being shallow, you deeper than me
Every second I just leap a degree
Defeating me is harder to do than getting something cheaper than free

What’s About To Happen,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Just a little glimpse… into the future
Mixed with a little of the present
And all real
What’s about to happen
Let’s go

Time-wasting, mind racing
Drink, kush, pills and line-chasing
Girl in her prime tryna find payment
Butt naked in the club with her behind shaking
Gangs killin’, brains spillin’
Young cat caught slippin’ in the Range, chillin’
Tryna make him call the truce but they ain’t willin’
Every wake, every funeral, the same feelin’
Now the po’ starvin’ so it’s mo’ robbin’
Crime in the hood, ain’t no solvin’
Creepin’ through the streets with no caution
Better run, it’s no time for slow joggin’
Thugs ratchet, love’s absent
Boys tryna get a piece of that plug action
Don’t sleep ‘cause nobody’s above blastin’
Posted up in the house full of drugs, trappin’
Disrespected, disconnected
Affected by educational misdirection
Everybody is divided by this election
Black man still hated for his complexion
You’re only as smart as your last purchase
Cars, tennis shoes and cash-worship
Clowns are runnin’ ‘round this mad circus
Trash evangelists and bad churches
Fakes grinnin’, snakes sinnin’
Degrading, exploiting, raping women
Who would land up in the fiery lake, swimming?
It’s settin’ the world up for a great ending
Now they mock us when we talk justice
Unarmed blacks shot by cops bustin’
The justice system we are not trustin’
March, protest and got nothing
They plan these sick grand schemes
Will they ever respect ya, homie? Man, please
Arrange your bloodshed that span seas
A government full of murderers and land-thieves
Chemical warfare got us soft and timid
Even if you ain’t with it, they’ll force you in it
They push birth control and abortion clinics
Endorse eugenics, it’s a cost a minute
The reject criticism of a failed system
Anybody speakin’ out on ‘em, they’ll get ‘em
They feed the people lies ’til the spell hit ‘em
‘cause they wanna take everybody to Hell with ‘em
They supply the dope and then we buy the dope
Distribute it through the hood, we try the dope
You sell, kill and die for dope
Go to court, let a crooked judge tie the rope
Now a child’ll go wild and strike his mother
Hate and envy just to spite each other
They planned it all out to make us fight each other
Hide the lies under a righteous cover
Technology shut down and ya can’t get it
Weak failing economy, it ain’t steady
Murder rate in the inner city ranks heavy
So the national guard gettin’ the tanks ready
To bring order through extreme slaughter
A call to kill us all from the King’s quarters
Every day that passes, peace seems farther
The bigger fool we act makes things harder
What are you gonna do to heal your wounds?
To play around, there’s really no more room
America’s gonna go back to war soon
She’s settin’ herself up for a hard doom
And the lust for wealth got us inclined to suffer
No chance for those with a mind to trust ya
God has ordained that it’s time to crush ya
Soon to be fighting with Iran, China and Russia
Now your greed is spiked out, now it’s lights out
Ninety percent of your armed forces wiped out
Greedy intentions to deny the right route
From evil men who occupy the White House
The government control, the citizens disperse
Voluntarily accepting the 666 curse
So many disasters, which will hit first?
The weather will increase, the storms will get worse
Satan is terminated but he tryna 
Creating chemistry to deflate our birthrate
But they’ll meet the fate of nations that were great
Whole cities destroyed by major earthquakes
The world will soon hear the sounds of war
Boots of every army will pound the floor
Not many in America found the door
Europe won’t even be around no more
Now the pain cuts like a long razor
Home invaders, drone lasers
Whether you got short or long paper
Gold or Bitcoins, it won’t save ya
Markets crashing, thoughtless actions
The banks will collapse, no corporate factions
No military aircrafts tossing rations
The heartless act out their darkest passions
You’re probably asking, ""Why this happening?""
Years of attacking red and brown and black men
Centuries of innocent lies subtractin’
It’s time to cash in so God’s reacting
With things that seem to be defying logic
All eyes will witness the flying objects
The lyin' rob us, define the hostage
Treating the citizens like a science project
You hate God but you love power
You kill the great man and hug cowards
The US streets will be blood-showered
By minds that operate above ours
And when you see it, you finally get it
Any ears that heard it and any eyes that read it
Try to give me props for it, I’ll deny the credit
‘Cause it didn’t come from me, Elijah said it
Yeah

Wanna know what’s ‘bout to happen
Keep wakin’ up
Keep wakin’ up
And when you wake up, stay woke",https://genius.com/K-rino-whats-about-to-happen-lyrics
Illusions,Danger Zone,1995.0,"So, K-Rino, I understand that you've been having a series of illusions
(Yeah, man, my mind just keep drifting into places I don't want it to go, man. I dont understand what's wrong with me...)
Well, in order for me to get a proper diagnosis, I'm gonna need you to explain it for me if possible
(I'll try man but...I'll try man)

As I fall into a deep sleep, knowledge is the drug I'm doping up
Eyes closed, I wait for mental doors to open up
I drift into the universal future events
I witness rhymes memorized without rehearsal
I found myself fighting in a rage
First page of the drama, South Park was the murder stage
So I let the tension build up, twenty they killed up
I stepped in the mix and got filled up
Skies were cloudy in my brain
I strain with pain and see the rain and blood or I'm bleeding like rain
I was too scared to fear it, so loud I couldn't hear it
Dimensional war man versus spirit
As I crossed my soul road, I met a warlord
Standing before me with the shield and a golden sword
He said forever I would burn, but fighting his soul to death
Would be the only way that I could return
Although it made no sense to me
I meditated till my mighty Black Book appeared instantly
However death was my conclusion
Although it appeared to be destruction it was only an illusion

It's only an illusion
(It's only an illusion)
It's only an illusion
(It's only an illusion)

Deep in South Park the projects
Home of the killers, dope fiends, hookers and car wrecks
Found myself on the verge of getting smothered
Tied up in a room full of fake under-covers
Caught up in a cross, the set up was tight and solid
Had 15 g's in a sack with two more in my wallet
They sent me upstairs to start the hit
Apartment two-twenty-one where the big boys ran they licks
Now ain't this a switch, I'm getting used by the police
Living life as a faking snitch
Knocked on the door real soft
They snatched me up and let me know a dope fiend already tipped 'em off
Knowing the cops was outside, them fools was fried
So they gon' murder me and then commit suicide
It ain't no mercy or no catch
Poured some gas all over my body and then they struck a match
The cops kicked until the door broke, bullets flew
Bodies were dropping both sides suffered death in the smoke
I'm caught in this confusion
Just as I thought that I was dying it was only an illusion


I think it's something psychiatric, K, so I'm gonna have to do some further analysis

Aw, man, I can't take this no more, man

I'm gonna need one more illusion, K

Yeah baby I love you too
I'ma come and scoop you later she said call before you come through
This was a girl I just met
She took my mind off my problems, a relationship was in effect
She knew I didn't play around
Went to her crib every now and then at night just to lay it down
She knows about the life that's trapping me
Knew that I had to watch myself with all these jealous suckers after me
Was there ever any doubt? No
I stopped pounding on that booty hard I started making love slow
I never had to get this lady straight
I told her 'bout this fool I hate, she said she knew him back in '88
A high-capper named Rick, ain't nothing changed
He was trickin' back then and he's still a trick
He's out to get me cus I split him
On the hoop-court cappin' for some freaks so I did him
My baby said he's only frontin'
Take your mind off it, K, come lay it down and let me show you somethin'
Another world is what she showed me, gave it like she owed me
Tied me to the bed and then she rode me
She said you like that, I said yeah baby you's a killer
She said I know and then she reached up under the pillow
I hope you enjoyed the blast son
And I hope that the hit was good cus it's your last one
All along this trick was gaming
Twenty brothers busted out of the closets strapped and aiming
Could it be another illusion? This one was real
Life is over school out murder conclusion


K! K wake up! K-Rino! Get up! Oh my god. K! Get up! C'mon K! C'mon K snap in to it. Get back. C'mon K...",https://genius.com/K-rino-illusions-lyrics
L-Dubb the Magnificient,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"What a lovely night

Peace was in my dimension, trouble was just a memory
Years had passed with no intergalactic activity
I'd retired from tripping with alien epiphanies
No foreign entities or spirits had come to visit me
Then just as I turned in for the evening I saw vividly
A female form appeared over my bed and blew a kiss at me
I was in a remote location, nobody lives with me
Raised up instantly trying to figured out who this could be
A breeze blew trough the room so cold that I began to shiver
She whispered softly in my ear and told me to come hither
In other words come with her, said she'd been waiting all day
I followed her as she levitated down my hallway
She was close to me but still somehow I couldn't touch her
I salivated over her anatomical structure
As she floated so gracefully waving her hands, luring me
Caressing me from a distance and constantly assuring me
My guard's totally down now, I'm dazed and in the zone
Not even seeming to care that this stranger was in my home
Her mouth's not even moving but somehow the words were spoken through
I looked below my feet then realized that I was floating too
Asked her who she was because her all aura compelled me
She told me once we reached our destination she would tell me
I followed willingly somehow knowing she wouldn't hurt me
She said that, ""If you want me you must to prove yourself worthy""
I didn't even question it, I knew that could be foolish
But I'm up for any challenge, ""Whatever you say I'll do it""
She said, ""I knew it"" and that's when I landed back on my feet
At that moment a gaping hole opened up underneath
Heard sweet melodies playing as I dropped a thousand feet
Landing perfectly on a comfortable plush-like leather seat
Again I asked her, ""Who are you? Because I think that I'm in love with you""
Opened her hands and in her palm was written LW
It was in that moment that I knew somehow we were compatible
I'd be happy to embark upon on an eternal sabbatical
With L-Dubb, her spell was so real I can't tell it
Hard to even spell it her facial features were angelic
So when we make  conversation she locks me in a deep state
In a place where we mentally connect for about a week straight
And every day I found myself hoping, wishing, assuming
That this would be the moment we consummate our union
Then one day, she came to me and told me it was time now
Her flesh became real I asked and she said never mind how
She whispered, ""Are you ready?"" I said, ""Yeah I'm coming at ya""
Finally about to touch her as I reached out someone snatched her

(*L-Dubb screams* as beat changes)
Whoa what just happened? Whoa whoa whoa hold up, hold up Where is she? Baby? Baby, where are you? (Haha)
Oh nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
First my rhyme books? Now my woman? Ha

The spot that she stood in was real hot and smoking
I was choking while yelling out, ""Baby stop joking""
Gone with no trace, no clue, no token
I ran to the house, the back door was wide open
Her scream was so alarming that I knew she was in torment
I found a document in the right pocket of her garment
It was a personal letter specifically for me
But it wasn't new, it was dated 2003
It said, ""In event that someone would ever take me
I've placed on this paper instructions on how to save me""
The letter was so precise, I was taken back abruptly
As I thought should I trust this? The next line said, ""Trust me""
You have all the clues that you need to help me escape
As I'm thinking, ""What clues?"" The next line said, ""In the safe""
Now I'm tripping to know how this was happening, I didn't
A list of things that were non-existent when this letter was written
I sprang into action, absent of hesitation
There was a map in the safe, it showed a location
It highlighted the top of a thousand mile mountain
I climbed it and entered the cave next to the fountain
The info that she left me in the safe was all valid
The second I entered, the cave turned into a palace
Immaculate full of magic majestic as the Moon
All gold with at least 250 rooms
After 2 hours of searching I had seen nothing at all
Then in a soft sweet voice my name was being called
I knew it was L-Dubb so I chased the sound blindly
But every time I got close I heard the voice behind me
Then to the left, then to the right, I felt like a buffoon
Every door I opened her voice moved to a different room
I was being fooled, all the running around was making me weaker
Heard a dark evil laugh come over the loud speaker
It said, ""I know who you're after so you better move faster
I plan to marry her but if you find her you can have her""
I said, ""Show yourself."" He said, ""I will before the nights done
Until then you can search the rooms and try to find the right one""
Her voice was still calling, not stopping but it might soon
Exhausted as I reached the 249th room
But when I opened 250, my brain cells collided
The last door was a room that had the other rooms inside it
I knew I had to do something now I've never done
Each door flew open and there she stood in every one
Some type of gun lowered down to me from the top
Then the evil voice said, ""K-Rino, I'll give you one shot""
I quickly knew that I was now dangling on a limb
Every image her quickly changed to an image of him
Did I think I had any hope after that? No I don't
He was too horrible to try to describe so I won't
He said, ""Shoot your only shot and if you strike the right image
I'll be destroyed and this entire challenge would be finished""
A 1 in 249 chance this is crazy
There was one clue remaining on the sheet that she have gave me
I looked at it and said, ""Hell no, something has gone wrong""
It was a picture of me with a weapon to my own dome
If this is was she meant she put a shady spin on it
Maybe this is all just a trick and she was in on it
That couldn't be true, the perfect chemistry we had found it
So I had to trust her no matter how crazy it sounded
I placed the weapon to my head and let the bullet fly out
He cried out and each image of him began to die out
I noticed that the whole place was consumed with fumes
And a body laid at the threshold of one of the rooms
The wicked one was wiped out, his corpse was on the ground
Then L-Dubb emerged in a long beautiful gown
I asked her how we'd make it when I'm knowing that I sprayed it though
She said, ""I placed an invisible shield around us days ago
The first time I showed up at your house and you were sleeping see
Then I came and deactivated his shield secretly""
Then I asked, ""Who was he?"" She said, ""Never mind"" softly
""He's been chasing me for three millenniums and finally caught me
I knew you were the one to save me I'm happy he's gone""
""What took so long?"" She said, ""I had to wait for you to be born""
I finally held her in my arms carried her away and then
We walked out of the castle and it turned into a cave again
Permanently branded, our thoughts running concurrently
Granted me the power to travel with her eternally
I had one more question, she said, ""Yes, what is it?""
""By the way what's L-Dubb?"" She whispered, ""Lady Wizard""
Now I get it and I'm seeing things I never saw before wow
In seconds we were at my home, time to close the door now

Ahah it's time to close the door now
No for real, time to close the door now!
Y'all can go, get out
The story's over",https://genius.com/K-rino-l-dubb-the-magnificient-lyrics
Marching To Massacre,Mind Vision,2019.0,"""We getting ready to have a live session
What we was trying to say....""
My quotes cause strokes and thrombosis, the dopeness encroaches and pokes
Leaving its hosts with throats bloated as blowfish
Resuscitation motions are hopeless
He slowly decomposes, moments after he's opened and his ghost splits
I boasted yet choked from the grossness
The odour was so ferocious, the vultures flew over holding their noses
With closed fists I'll scope you and focus
Then stand close to a lightning bolt to show that my body can hold the voltage
I'm frightening as a cyclone soon as they turn the mic on
When I'm at home alone, the darkness sleeps with the lights on
My mind's a ride crossing time zones on mileage
Is so vibrant, that I can hear a phone on silent
All my written imagery has been rendered extensively
From the the thought embassy 23 members assemble me
My appearance was pivotal, yet conceded a miracle
'Cause my physical consists of non-existent material
Rappers losing balance and staggering, never grasping what's happening
Arrogant fabricants with drafts unnatural as Saccharin
Tracks attacking your plasma and acting as a coagulant
So masterful I draft accurate fact brackets by accidents
When I'm hatefully stepping to a page with aggression
The pictures in my house begin changing their facial expressions
After blow-torching the beat I wander off in my sleep
Performing surgeries on random people walking the street
And if you gossip I'll pop open your top quick, as a locksmith
My whole closet is stocked with big boxes of drop kicks
With no possible logic his doctor opted to watch as
His biological clock ticks two notches from hospice
I move and let creative angels through
I can't even explain to you why my cranial powers have been so sustainable
So who can say they've seen the things that K has seen
I'm hatefully erasing dreams while playfully singing the speed racer theme
I set a precedent for elite development
I be more eloquent than rappers with a speech impediment
I'm never reticent—I met and beat 11 men
But neglected to mention them 'cause I rather wreck 'em in sets of 10
My cleverness level is futuristically present tense
Hard to register how the most hellish men can be heaven-sent
No one is actually better than me, it's factually evident
I'll sprint away and get back so quick as if I never went
I grew petulant due to its tepid musical excrement
The most threatening click is the regiment that I represent
Respect and deference is a testament to my excellence
I strike faster than you ever did when I'm being hesitant
Smite you with one punch but he felt it twice
I'm under a sweltering light, precisely redeveloping melted ice
He yelled for Christ right after he felt the knife
That's when I selfishly dealt the spice that would quickly stifle his helpless life
So he'll cruise in a hearse shortly
I'm so raw that I murked 40 people then get involved in each search party
Attacking your neural so i have to be thorough
So many facets that me alone is actually plural
I won't stop at haste to put you in your proper place
I hover upside down holding a topless chocolate shake and not a drop would waste
Was born and bred with an abnormal head
The pharmacist said that I'm more likely to cause torment when I'm on my meds
Gradually replenishing my energetic faculties
When I stare at dead batteries, they charge up automatically
The mundane continue to run game
My tongue is so untamed, some days I let it shoot off at the gun range",https://genius.com/K-rino-marching-to-massacre-lyrics

Flow Session Number 4,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"They said he couldn't do it no more
Let’s see if they right

He couldn't withstand the blast that he felt
Beating me is hard to pull off like a chastity belt
I'm returning to the war zone to flame my opponents
The game keep calling me back like I was hanging up on it
Stopping me is a task no one's able to do
Like trying to seat a thousand people at a table for two
See what I’m saying's heating iron, on the mic defeating giants
I’m a lion-eating man, that eats man-eating lions
When I please, I still punish and rip with ease
Like a plate of nachos, I stack chips and cheese
Question me I gotta flame you, then I'll probably show you something painful
Like stuffing both your feet into the same shoe
Every line got the people in the joint raving
Cut your index finger off, I call it point shaving
I'm the rap landlord, you a damn fraud
Trying to charge a pair of Jordans with a Sams card
Rough bar chooser, hard 2 by 4 user
Beat and bruise ya after I win, now you a sore loser
I gotta cannon mouth, tongue whoopings I hand 'em out
My presence is everywhere like Santa’s house
Get it straight, I didn’t come to make the party bounce
I came to bust you in the face with a forty ounce
Pages new, you be crying like a baby do
Still got clothes on lay-away from '82
In brain square mileage, I’m imagined mentally
Your brain's inefficient see you pissing where you kitchen be
I got music in my bag, coast to coast I push
I thought I told you that men ain’t supposed to douche
Rhyme-sack you with my mind's immaculate
I’m a beast, I put it down like I was tired of packing it
Money I’m stacking it, my crew is unruly they pop fast
When they catch you its outta my hands like a dropped pass
On a wack scale of 1 to 10 you sure to rate
When you rank it's like taking a leak, you're an eight
You could be one of them big screen stars
But when I catch you it’s a wrap, just like sixteen bars
K-Rino is in the hood everyday, I don’t miss the fights
You come and hang once a year like Christmas lights
You like to talk about your past and all your ex-stunts
I speak on things that I already did next month
I ain’t got time for silly little playful things
You 6' 5"", 260 with a naval ring
I get on a roll, vocab is so cold
I like to eat my cereal and milk with no bowl
I step my game up to improve the sport
Stole some of my own lyrics and took myself to court
I’m the flow man, 
wingspan of Rodan
Slick enough to pick your pocket with yo' hand
Rap slicing, reciting, striking and writing verbs
Verses swinging like Tyson I call ‘em fighting words
I’m down to get a private or a public win
Like hand sanitizer, after doing dirt I rub it in
Whenever you around lies gon' scatter
Like when your girlfriend told you size don’t matter
Whoever said K-Rino wasn't heated they lied
I picked my skill up early like it needed a ride
Rappers get caught up in the deep just for crossing the street
I won’t let you change the game like you lost your receipt
If we do carry heat you'll never find it on us
Your CEO gave you a twenty dollar signing bonus
Ran opponents out the game they couldn't stand the losses
Line for line they coming up shorter then a Vienna sausage
You talking tough partner but you look sweet
You ain’t hot, ‘cause you ain’t ready like undercooked meat
I stay in rare form to achieve this work
Got the right to bare arms like a sleeveless shirt
Terminating you is something I can’t wait to do
You could be my twin and I still couldn’t relate to you
When I get through, I get a long ovation
My pen stays on paper like it's on probation
Winning odds, 87 to 1
Fool beating me is like your girlfriends hair, it's never been done (Ha)",https://genius.com/K-rino-flow-session-number-4-lyrics
"He Say, She Say",Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Since I know what you're thinking...
I'll just say it for ya

They say he's basic some say he has many faces
They say he's with the nation of Islam and he's a racist
Some people don't like him some say he gotta lot of skill
Some say if he's so good then how come he ain't gotta deal?
They say he's too hood some say that he ain't hood enough
They say yeah he can rap, but his beats ain't good enough
They talk about him every day I heard what they said
See he ain't even gotta car that fool ain't got no bread
His partners crazy yo don't hang around too long with them
Girl he don't even drink or smoke weed what's wrong with him?
The money that he had he figured out a way to lose it
He only hates the radio 'cause they don't play his music
He's always claiming that he'll help you when he know he wouldn't
He bragging 'bout he never left the hood that's coz he couldn't
To me it's looking like he's losing but he said he winning
Always rapping about the lord but yet he steady sinning

He say she say, criticize and steady doubt me
I ain't gotta be around ya, I know what you said about me
Just 'cause you don't understand my path you wanna re-route me
Fighting with my demons and eventually I'll get em out me

He too old to be rhyming his card been expired
Twenty years and he ain't rich he should've been retired
Maybe he can get more fans if he retype his image
He'll sell a hood out in a second for the right percentage
He need to hit the mainstream to increase his fame
Look at his clothes he ain't fly where's his piece and chain?
They say he talking all political and acting tough
I bet he'll act right if them people ever snatched him up
He's judgmental he looks down on those with low coherence
He ain't never had to struggle he had both his parents
He tells alot of lies, none of that's true what'cha heard
He never faced off with the cops it's just studio words
He need to get a real job all that time he wasted
I seen him at the club all the time skirt chasing
He always talking about grinding he ain't getting dough
His partners called to help 'em fight he ain't even show

He say she say, criticize and steady doubt me
I ain't gotta be around ya, I know what you said about me
Just 'cause you don't understand my path you wanna re-route me
Fighting with my demons and eventually I'll get em out me
He say she say, criticize and steady doubt me
I ain't gotta be around ya, I know what you said about me
Just 'cause you don't understand my path you wanna re-route me
Fighting with my demons and eventually I'll get em out me

He ain't moving no units his stash ain't long with G's
I seen him at a block party slanging his own CD's
First chance he get a knife at your back he'll be stickin'
He act like he a mack I know for a fact he be trickin'
All of his concepts ain't new some of 'em been slightly covered
Them fools in the SPC don't even like each other
Who's a G? Yeah he cool but he ain't cool as me
He raise another man's child what kind of fool is he?
He really wants to be a star he persistently fronts
He disses mainstream rappers that's publicity stunts
How can he give you advice with all his bad decisions?
He always tryna convert people to his religion
They say he should've went to college to earn a degree
Why should I buy his album when I can burn it for free?
But I got words that ya won't be remembering ya heard
Some unspoken sign language resembling a bird

He say she say, criticize and steady doubt me
I ain't gotta be around ya, I know what you said about me
Just 'cause you don't understand my path you wanna re-route me
Fighting with my demons and eventually I'll get em out me
He say she say, criticize and steady doubt me
I ain't gotta be around ya, I know what you said about me
Just 'cause you don't understand my path you wanna re-route me
Fighting with my demons and eventually I'll get em out me",https://genius.com/K-rino-he-say-she-say-lyrics
Even When It’s Bad,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"Let me ask you a question
When was the last time, think about this one time
When you sat outside and appreciated the sunshine?
Glad to give thanks and pray, even on a rainy day
Simple things in you life helps to push that pain away
Lookin' at your son's face, lookin' at your daughter's smile
They don't know about this world
They don't know it's hard and wild
All they know is daddy's home
All they know is mamma's love
Ain't no use exposin' them how stressful your drama was
Lot of times you wanna quit, walk away from it all
But your babies motivate you, lift you when you about to fall
Innocent to all the evil, people in that change of state
Wish they could stay young forever, unaware pain and hate
Try to be a better mother, try to be a better dad
Workin' daily just to give them all the things you never had
Knowin' that's the true reward, only that can help you deal
Family is the only thing that matters, nothing else is real

It's still good even when it's bad (still good)
It's still good even when it's bad (still good)
It's still good even when it's bad (yeah)
I try to feel good even when I'm sad (feel good)
No matter what you're goin' though there's (no matter)
Something God is tellin' you (yeah, yeah)
Don't throw your faith and love away (yeah)
Just fake it for another day

Evern days that I feel depressed , lonely, and my spirits low
Barely recognizin' who I'm seein' in the mirror bro
Don't know how this came about
I was fine the night before
Questions in my head be naggin' answer that I'd like to know
What I got to do to duck and dodge life's foolish traps
How come all these rats is eatin' while I'm siftin' though the scraps
Hold up, least you got some scraps, plus a dream in a distance
Mamma and your daddy always right there when you need assistance
Every person's out to find the happiness the hear deserves
People give me energy with positive and thoughtful words
You never know what's on a person mind when they are down
Sayin' something nice to somebody might turn they day around
When things ain't goin' our way we tend to feel betrayed
Some days I say ""yeah I'm broke but at least my bills are paid""
Praise to the creator for makin' room for me
Soon to be back because every new mornin' brings opportunity

It's still good even when it's bad (still good)
It's still good even when it's bad (still good)
It's still good even when it's bad (yeah)
I try to feel good even when I'm sad (feel good)
No matter what you're goin' though there's (no matter)
Something God is tellin' you (yeah, yeah)
Don't throw your faith and love away (yeah)
Just fake it for another day

The reason why you think your life's on an unlucky path (why?)
It's 'cause you're focusin' on what you want, not what you have
Closed minded, you don't see the world for what it is
'Cause you would clearly know how good you got it if you did
Selfishness and no gratitude is you deterrent
Next time you drivin' though your city just be more observant
And when you see people who got it worse then you, assess it
Maybe that sight will make you put your life in true perspective
It might not be the best one, but you got a ride
May not be a lavish house, but every night you sleep inside
You can eat whenever you get ready, shower 'cause you able
You can turn your TV on and kick your feet up on the table
God made you so never put no one above
We learned about love before we knew what money was
I felt like givin' up too before, I will admit it
Lets stop wishin' for what we want and start workin' to get it

It's still good even when it's bad (still good)
It's still good even when it's bad (still good)
It's still good even when it's bad (yeah)
I try to feel good even when I'm sad (feel good)
No matter what you're goin' though there's (no matter)

Supernova,Mightier Than the Sword,2018,"K is the flame writer, came to light up the game brighter
Jump off of the studio and use my binder as a hang glider
Accurate tracker my head traffic is faster
Leave rappers in fragments like a smashed package of crackers
People of all ages bathing in my arrangements
K has written a page for every single occasion
Gazing into space they say that maybe he's dazing
Seven planets away I can see the aliens waving
See you and me don't move in congruency
So the fool will seek to ruin me due to my intuitive sentence fluency
I'll kill a rapper from each nation and if you be patient
I can remake 'em back from cremation
Rough as a road of gravel the toughest opponents baffled
Words slap you I practice by playing blindfolded scrabble
My mic grip is strong as a man pulling a range
I'll crumble a single coin into a handful of change
The anointed clairvoyant appointed to harm and disarm you without warning
I'll storm you like a swarm of mad hornets
My standards for raw carnage is enormous
So I could bomb 'em every morning and not be satisfied with my performance
In this environment I'm a tyrant
Every child in my school gets a 50 year homework assignment
You're blind but I could stand behind a fence from nine tenths
Of a miles length and still read tiny lines of fine print
I demolish a lot of tracks I live in a private shack
And sleep inside a giant amniotic sac
The incredible wrecker the alphabetical letter inspector
Who slipped 11 weapons through metal detectors
Better respecter, cherubim blessed with an impeccable lecture
Severing lessons I teach in medical sectors
I'll assume the title I'm the lunar idol walking on the Moon with Micheal
If you don't like me someone will like a unicycle
Whether noon or night the doom will strike you
The inhuman typewriter who can swing violently from another room and fight you
Sparking supernova thoughts
So even if I throw a soft vocal it can knock a swollen mans shoulder off
Deadly as an Ebola cough
I wrote this part in total darkness on an ark being circled by two ferocious sharks
Your whole team I'ma bleed them 'cause of your low scheming
I'm so extreme when I beat him I heard his clothes screaming
With each new morning I reboot
My eyelids are see-through so I can see you even when I'm sleep too
Secret pro with a deep flow, my dome is real steep so
If it keeps growing people can slide down it like a ski slope
Attack you with a track that I doubt you could match
Have your shadow walking around here without you attached
Practicing rewind got a scientific mind like I'm Urkel
I'll freeze time and run a straight line in a circle
Mind communication nothing spoken on the phone
When I step to a window the blinds open on their own
Followers came to my front door hoping I was home
They saw me sipping on a snowcone and floating on a drone
I peeled my roof back hear voices like, ""Who's that?""
Me and twenty personalities in a group chat
Dumbfounding the greats with my literary capers
I wrote two full albums on one sheet of paper
Paid killer always chasing the next bounty
Throw a pass to myself and catch it in the next county
Bars leaving them nauseous, your's weak and lethargic
Hearts sliding in front of moving cars taking charges
Never met anybody formidabl
It's mystical how I use my lyrical audio to create a visual
Picture it as I mention it
I'm the symphony conductor whose orchestra plays compositions using no instruments",https://genius.com/K-rino-supernova-lyrics
Out The Way,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Nah man, I'm good
I got to be somewhere and it ain't here
I wish you the best though
That just ain't me, let's go

It’s a lot of shady folks living on the planet
Some of the worst ones be up in your own family
Whole city full of evil bastards
I trust gangstas more than the pastors
Stop breaking bread with small minds
Rule one: protect your energy at all times
Build your circle with real women and real dudes
Miserable people walk in a room and kill moods
K-Rino don’t entertain what they talking ‘bout
Once I see ‘em walking in, I be walking out now
Ain’t tryna hear no pettiness, you dumb as hell
Don’t put me on no gossip, put me on that money trail
Trouble around me, I’ma break those walls
Messy conversations, I don’t even take those calls
Some people wanna see everyone fail
Deception outside steppin’ like Le’Veon Bell yeah

I’m just staying out the way
I’m just staying out the way
I’m just staying out the way
All that petty bullsh—, that ain’t how I operate
Can’t be messing ‘round, boy, these streets is too hot to play
Caught up in some silly madness, nah, not today (not today)

You’re feeling like your patience is long gone
Can’t even find peace of mind in your own home
Bad moods, attitudes goin’ on strong
People talkin’ to you in the wrong tone
And I ain’t taking that one second, black
Tryna learn how to think instead of just react
Sometimes you snap when folks don’t respect the fact
Then they tell you that you’re wrong when you check ‘em back
Nah, that’s when their true colors start to wring out
It seem like every year, so I gotta clean house
Gotta clear the artificial people from the air
Now you’re changing phone numbers like underwear
Want to know how you fell off of your game quick
Because in life you become who you hang with
A lot of cats play the partner role on the scene
Just ‘cause you wear my uniform don’t mean you on my team

I’m just stayin’ out the way
I’m just stayin’ out the way
I’m just stayin’ out the way
All that petty bullsh—, that ain’t how I operate
Can’t be messin’ ‘round, boy, these streets is too hot to play
Caught up in some silly madness, nah, not today (not today)

I ain’t hatin’ on your hustle, get it how you live
But if it ain’t for me, I’ma take it to the crib
It ain’t right to play with freedom every night and day
I watched too many of my patners throw their life away
Every lick ain’t for you, it’s time to learn now
Understand it’s certain things you gotta turn down
People plotting, everybody out for your profit
Now every dollar that you stacked up, your lawyer got it
No more time to run streets every night, hanging
Certain decisions that you make can be life-changing
I ride solo like that man on the Polo
Keeping my thoughts quick, even when I’m moving in slow-mo
I’m staying far out your area
And money’ll make a upright man get out of character
Taking drama from my vocabulary
Even the one you’re sleeping next to can prove to be your adversary

I’m just stayin’ out the way
I’m just stayin’ out the way
I’m just stayin’ out the way
All that petty bullsh—, that ain’t how I operate
Can’t be messin’ ‘round, boy, these streets is too hot to play
Caught up in some silly madness, nah, not today (not today)",https://genius.com/K-rino-out-the-way-lyrics
Raising the Bars,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Bars on top of bars
Yeah, turn me up just a little bit, the beat
Yeah

I’m telling you that I patrol this emceeing zone
I get it popping like nappy hair when it’s being combed
You straight fooling, your G status—it ain’t proven
Should have named your CD dead body ‘cause it ain’t moving
I can put my bread up but who gon’ cover yours?
Career going up in flames like a hoverboard
Spar you without a scar, skilled in the art of war
I go from zero to sixty before I start the car
You can’t give it to the rap game the way they needing
You don’t belong like a six-pack at an A.A. meeting
Fake reputation breaker, big money raker
My song’s folder is thicker than two Sunday papers
Snake chumps get busted like a face bump
Straight dump because you faker than a lace front
I’m on fire and well seasoned like jambalaya
I’ll make a scene at Burger King, get your mama fired
Your shows are empty yet you still talking hard and loud
You could be a sketch artist and couldn’t draw a crowd
Told ‘em you holding the top spots, you liar trick
You ain’t gon' ever be number one like a side-chick
Rest in peace to your career, every one of y’all
I’ll put you on a t-shirt like I was Underdog
I hate to change the subject but something I want share:
I ain't gon’ lie your woman’s hair need Obamacare
My intellect and work ethic makes K a winner
You keep talking and I'ma snap like I’m playing center
I’m pretty friendly but don’t take it for granted and slip
If my CD ever scratched the whole planet’ll skip
I might sit down and write ‘cause I’m the truth kid
Or maybe come off of the head like a loose wig
The abolition, the tactical practitioner
Fixing to lose my cool like a broken air conditioner
I keep climbing that’s why my skill’s better than theirs
You couldn’t reach another level if you walked upstairs
While you keep harassing me I’m tryna concentrate, the beat is on
Act like you working at a bank and leave me alone
You tryna put me in a verbal diss
You bout to mess up bad like a heart surgeon with hiccups and a nervous twitch
You bring these common fools, you gonna lose
See I’m that dude that where I’m at these dumb rappers hate to be there like summer school
Revenge is sweet and I was born raw
He walked into his door and saw me pissed off with his grandpa in an arm-bar
Not many who go to war with me have gone far
I’ll open you up from a distance like OnStar
You’re just a liar with a pointy nose
Your flows used to belong to other folks like Salvation Army clothes
See me team is strongly represented
I’ll make your eyes scream like Visine with cayenne pepper in it
K-Rino the great flowing self-made poet
My music’s so dope that a klepto even paid for it
Now you’re conspiring to wipe me out entirely
But I’m so fire that your ghostwriter tried to hire me
I’m laying in the cut, waiting for my rival, G
Kicked everyone off the planet ‘cause I like my privacy
Play me on your car radio every strong line
And like powder I’ll be in your system a long time
I’ll call you on the phone and explain stuff
But if I put you on hold for a week you better not hang up
I grab you by your neck aggressive and vicious
And keep sliding you like I’m holding a phone going through pictures",https://genius.com/K-rino-raising-the-bars-lyrics
Conception of Concept, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Feeling good tonight baby
My stamina is high, haha
I don't need no Viagra, no Cialis
All I need is concentration, inspiration
Deep meditation
Conceptualization

When a thoughts conceived and the concept's born
The mission is to create a song far from the norm
Convey a phrase in the most unconventional ways
And lay as the instrumental repetitiously plays
In space I gaze till the creative antennas raise
Then the premise of the image I make takes center stage
Straight clarity when the mental clutter disintegrates
When it's laid, I gotta say at times I've been amazed
In silence ‘cause chaos can block the process
Pulling topics from the gothic Cosmic Closet
Disorganized initially, eventually pin ‘em
Into a multisyllabic sentence with metaphors and similes
And it's a cornucopia of utopian opium
And floating through the scope of a wide-open fallopian
Slipping from the cocoon, developed then enhanced
It flutters just like a butterfly and delicately lands like ahhhhh!

And it feels so good to me, yeah yeah
I think I need a glass of juice and something real sweet, yeah yeah
And it feels so good to me, yeah yeah
I think I need a glass of juice and something real sweet, yeah

Thought race that separates from physical trace
Words manifest themselves in a visual state
Written dreams and unimaginable lyrical schemes
Are convened and derived from empirical means
Let ‘em bloom until the sunlight strikes the Moon
Then zoom and move the middle of the night to noon
Quite similar to a womb, giving life to tombs
And cognitivity is released like balloons
Now my cranium’s a flaming ganglion
With concepts dangling in the brain, a perpetual chain of them
I drink from the class of every imminent passage
Of that blessing I possess unlimited access
I project through the black hole and beyond that
Think connect with another soul, mental contacts
Form in a line, it multiplies over time
And transcontinentally unifies many minds
But it starts as a form of an incomplete ladder
Abstract data giving birth to concrete matter
Then I add another wrung, confident and overwhelmed
As I go to other levels and metaphysical realms
I master ‘em with singular sequences
With tedious thinking and each new one I reach is deep as the previous
Total awareness of every compound that surrounds me
Below and above ground or up and down, see
Start studying and lead observationers crown me
With the ability to sound the expound profoundly
The creationists trace human behavior
The ways of the world, the understanding of nature
The greatness placed in everything by the Creator
Every phase of life is translated to paper
Racing through every category, every Segway
It ejects straight into hairs and impregnates like ahhhhh!

And it feels so good to me yeah yeah
I think I need a glass of juice and something real sweet, yeah yeah
And it feels so good to me, yeah yeah
I think I need a glass of juice and something real sweet, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-conception-of-concept-lyrics
Artificial Existence,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"When there's no more jobs to go to and desperation has enclosed you
And it's harder to get water plus there's no food
No seeds beneath the earth to grow
And all the towns' electric circuits blow and cell phones and Internet don't work no more
When ain't no alcohol inside the bar
And the gas station is out of gas so you can't even drive your car
And folks panic and start to act out
And you can't even check the status of the planet cause the television is blacked out
No basketball or football games to watch, the flames are hot
And it won't matter how many nice cars and chains you got
Your hand grips your pistol, the land you stand in Is dismal
And the radio won't transmit a signal
Picture yourself alive to see that, how will you react
When you can't find no fast-food places to eat at?
And now it won't be long before you know that some thing's wrong
Cause future circumstances could snatch you outta your comfort zone

Caught in the midst of this modern mental commitment
You thinking that every thought I spit you is distant
You so conditioned it's hard to get you to listen
You blindly living this artificial existence

Let me give you something to think about
Imagine yourself being stuck-out even with plenty of cash inside your bank account
Malicious hearts, you can't tally the cost
And your money is irrelevant cause all its value is lost
Nerves bad, all your cigarettes is gone, no smoking
No more partying, the night clubs are no longer open
And you care now because you scared now, it's not a game
Nobody to borrow from cause their conditions the same
The same madness repeated daily
Shaky cause everything you see is crazy, no diapers or formula to feed your baby
You never thought for one second dude;
That you see normal people begging and threatening you over a spec of food
Your darkest day you now know it
You been hearing about this time for years but kept playing around and didn't prepare for it
Now everyone you know is hopeless and lifeless
The result of the United State's economical crisis


You ask yourself how did it get this way?
Night and day suffering in pistol play, a whole nation draped in chaos and disarray
Saw human morals drift astray
The conditions are so inflated with hate that it made some people forget to pray
Live or die starve or not
And it's no longer safe to walk the block because the streets is hotter than a coffee pot
You never thought you'd see this system fall
Payback for years of victory y'all so many actions, I can't list em all
Now it's exposed how its riches arose
Every state and every city all it's businesses is closed
So ask yourself is your future really worth something?
Or are you still only concerned with getting high or tryna twerk something
Can you defend your family and your spouse?
How many of y'all have got at least two months of food stored up in your house
Go hard no matter how it seems cause what I'm describing to you
Is true reality the world you living now's a dream


Right now I want you to stop
And just look around you
Look to your left and to your right, up, down
Notice your surroundings
And picture that being gone in a blink of a eye
No food, mass hysteria in the streets
Hell, even the animals got sense enough to store food away
Prepare yourself for a day when this life won't be as you see it now",https://genius.com/K-rino-artificial-existence-lyrics
No Stress,The Maven,2013.0,"Y'all don't know me, haha
You bout to get to know me real good, come on
Ain't nothing wrong man, everything is good
When you see me, drop all the drama
Watch how you do this

See, I know that life can be scandalous
I'm a wizard not a genie, but I'll grant a wish
Everybody needs a place that they can go rest
So right now you can call me Mr. No Stress
No storms, every sky that you see is sunny
Your baby mama called and asked if you needed money
Your car started, you ain't even have to flip your hood
Bill collector left a message said, ""Don't trip, you good""
I got the power to reverse what you going through
Got your bread back from everybody who was owing you
Arguments, you ain't entertaining no thoughts of that
Your son and daughter ain't doing no talking back
Every trial now thrown in a separate pile
Every discrepancy you ever had reconciled
Do what you do, if the world wanna be mad let it
Every piece of drama, I'ma clean it up like bad credit

When you know you gave your best
And people still wanna protest
When they surround you with more mess
Just call Mr. No Stress

Mr. No Stress, baby you ain't heard of me
I got you covered on them warrants, you can drive worry free
Money problems on your mind, tell you what I'm sent to do
You already got the job, no need for an interview
Nothing but love from every person who close to you
Baby daddy doing everything he supposed to do
The service I provide has nothing to do with ends
It's free of charge, take my card, pass it to your friends
Been a minute since you heard the word 
hate
 once
By the way your rent is paid up to eight months
Mind refresh, you ready for a bigger test
You forgot about the dope, liquor and cigarettes
People gossiping, no need to go back at 'em
You heard them women talk about you, you just laughed at 'em
You thinking it's a fantasy, but it can be real
Mr. No Stress, hit me if you need a refill

When you know you gave your best
And people still wanna protest
When they surround you with more mess
Just call Mr. No Stress

I didn't come to put you down, I came to show you how
You can lift some of the stress off of your shoulders now
You control your own life, you don't need a horoscope
Reading what another fraud wrote, living on borrowed hope
Instead of solid faith, can't handle the sharp curves
You can't believe in that garbage bored in God's words
Don't be deceived by the fragrance of a fly aroma
The result of every condition's controlled by it's owner
Don't pop a vein, see nobody plays a perfect game
Strong minded people see the Sun during a hurricane
Sometimes others sell you dreams when they see your pain
Watch 'em 'cause the light at the tunnel's end could be a train
Remain sane, make the real effort to be the change
We don't even know the level of power that we contain
Keep in mind, mental stress can break a body down
You can never drown in evil waters 'long as God's around

When you know you gave your best
And people still wanna protest
When they surround you with more mess
Just call Mr. No Stress

See, whatever you believe yourself to be
That's what you are man, you can't let problems at home
Problems at school, problems at work, haters on the block
You can't let these people dictate your mood and your reality, man
It's not who you are that holds you back
It's who you think you're not, call Mr. No Stress",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-stress-lyrics

Twenty artists that’s marvelous, any genre regardless if
It’s an author, guitarist, r&b singer or novelist
Went to rich from impoverished so the obvious moral is
Since I started worked hardest and been exalted because of it
As I lay in my palace, kicking sick hateful analysis
Written pages of battle spit, palms laden with calluses
I’ll be slaying the blasphemous everyday with no absences
Changing phrases to calculus with the ways of an alchemist
Reaching deep in a sea of ‘em, speeches leak at a premium
Breeding and feeding ‘em in my cerebral endometrium
I speak to mediums that teach me of nature’s ingredients
Then drink the sweetness that discretely secretes from its thelium
I’m slow cooking and simmering, prepping them for dismemberment
Fifty pound Timberlands, you ever seen a sheet of paper hemorrhaging?
Sleeping in Narnia, dreaming I had insomnia
In a dorm in a storm, conjuring ominous formulas
When you try to get hostile quick, my responses are monstrous
And the blocks get rocketed out of pockets of consciousness
I break cosmic rules and laws, make prophets using bars
Make molecules dissolve and silence move through walls
Your attempts are commendable, my offense indefensible
Twist and flip you continual ’til you’re rendered expendable
I can still remember these bars with years of memory loss
Rip your extremities off then make you give me applause
I like to stare at civilians while preparing to kill them
The schizophrenic birthday clown scaring the children
Flashing simple dramatics that bend and rip through metallics
I’m more twisted and callus than maggots mixed in a salad
Reduce your weight into ounces and propagate my announcements
Indoctrinate a new sound that’ll knock you straight through a mountain
I’m foraging and exploring, orbiting in a DeLorean
Every morning waking you, playing my songs on an accordion
Hateful and slanderous, misbehaving and scandalous
Nauseating my handlers as I bathe in tarantulas
We kidnap material tyrants then make up theories and write ‘em
Pack master satchels I use to gather invisible items
My right hand’ll deface ya, my other hand is a razor
Communicate to the H ’til my mother’s standing in Asia
My escapades and endeavors shock and amaze you forever
Twenty days in the craziest weather, blending phrases together
I’m racing and spinning cars, no way you can win the war
I’m at a pagan seminar, chasing and slaying Minotaurs
I’m serving plates in my school ’til every nation is full
My verticality baffles the gravitational pull
I’m halting the replication of all dismal creations
Break the code of any language with hand signal translations
My impeccable stats got them checking for facts
I let bats enter and swim in your intestinal tract, I’m out
I'm Out",https://genius.com/K-rino-lightning-language-lyrics
The Phantom’s Anthem,Alien Baby,2011.0,"I drive my load so wild that it's hard to ride sober
When I want to switch lanes, I make the road slide over
My style's are placed on a private base
With each one of the phrases I create need a thousand acres of closet space
To face K-Rino is hard luck, I spent the whole day
Connected to a Dodge truck letting my body charge up
You can't avoid the true test
I don't use earthly ammunition you'll need a asteroid proof vest
I speak the language of the insects
My hands are twenty screen cineplex with a live volcano's heat index
Me not the best, you shouldn't have said such
Surgical-like hair cuts are the results of sling blade air ducts
For no reason my cerebrum improves with the seasons
Upon release my thoughts produce ectoplasm excretions
My anecdotes receive standing O's
And blow gashes the size of cantaloupes, you'll need a car cover to bandage those
The more I study, my advantage grows, a true alien and it shows
Dove from a cliff and landed in a mantis pose pose
My monograms have been known, pretend clones I send home
And uppercut your chin bone until it's ingrown
I'll peel until your skin's gone
On the field, I'll let you score because I planted landmines inside the end zone
You suffer plagues and afflictions, I'm the clairvoyant
Who predicted Nostradamus would make his predictions
I stood over the monuments adorned with celestial bodies
That hung from my arms like tree ornaments
This is the vengeance for decadence
The restitution will recompense with infinite spread measurements
The scholastic rap chaplain
I clap until the whole world notices the presence of your absence
The egg inside a vultures nest is where I go for rest
My flows ingest amalgamate with moulded flesh in coalesce
I rocket through the cosmics with aeronautics
You are product of  and a builder of anthropomorphic objects
I got a mind that far dated Einstein, reincarnated 9 times
With raw jaded lines cause I'm
The electric wire light proprietor of the fire core
Kaleidoscopic hybrid with the jaw of a dinosaur
Vice gripper windpipe with a right claw when I fight in war
Got the power to switch tomorrow night with the night before
I'm the combined Rodimus and Optimus Prime
I was designed to carry 8 mics at a time and drop an octopus rhyme
One day, I'll end my recitals and pass down the title
But for actions of my disciples I won't be held liable
No man can put an end to this ministry
Aided by chemistry in the seven centers of spiritual energy
The pseudo intellect speaks cynically till they see me visually
Paint word portraits with asymmetrical symmetry
Which some insist to be contradictory but I'm beyond what's done traditionally
What's hard for some is done by me simplistically
But as I say on this beat today you'll hear no from K
So, now I lay in deep silence and listen to this organ play",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-phantoms-anthem-lyrics
Wizards Ransom 2 (The Final Battle),Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"Why man, why did I even get myself into this?
Should’ve stayed at home from the very beginning
Should’ve never went to that carnival
Why, WHY?

When he told me I wasn’t his father, I laid there in shock
I felt betrayed, mislead, degraded and mocked
“What you mean?” he said “Well, I’ve been slightly dishonest”
Said ""The Sorcerer had two sons and I was the youngest
You were too emotional to see the patterns and clues
This entire episode was an elaborate ruse""
“What about the guy you fought with?” I asked in a rage
He said “That was my older brother, that whole fight was staged”
Sure enough the other guy then came into the room
They laughed while contemplating how to render my doom
My fellow SPC members stood against me as well
With all my powers now inside them I’m empty as hell
They lifted me to my feet, a room they took me into
Every person I’ve ever knew, had been kidnapped too
My whole family and anyone that I could’ve enlisted
My soldiers, my loyal assistant and even the Mystic
They had covered every base, every move I could make
So there was no one left to contact to help me escape
Had to give them credit, their methods were out of the norm
Everyone I knew was snatched up and my powers were gone
If there’s a miracle to see, then I’m the one who would need it
For the first time I felt hopeless, done and defeated
I was fatigued and worn down but still I was living
But the next day would the day that my fate would be given
Usually, this would be the time I gather my forces
But now I was thoughtless with no resources
I was nauseous, needed something to drink in my hand
But something in me kept pushing me to think of a plan
They had soldiers on the outside guarding the door
A hindrance to any options I could start to explore
Here I was this no plot, no definitive scheme
Had to think on mortal levels, and use primitive means
The guards were all around me like a killer convention
One of them was DBX, so I got his attention
I said “Listen, it’s me man, we’ve all been scammed
I’ve known you for thirty years; can’t you see who I am?
Think deep, concentrate, am I kinda familiar?”
All he said was “Try to pull a move and I’ll kill ya!”
I was wondering how long this evil would last
The iron door was closed shut, but I could see through the glass
In the adjacent room was a large porcelain tank
I remembered that it contained the liquid potion I drank
But what I didn’t see at time at drank the fluid
Was a container with the antidote right next to it
There were two men stationed on the outside pacing
Put my face up to the door and hear their whole conversation
One of them said the only way they keep my powers
Was to make me drink the potion every three or four hours
So their means is not permanent as I thought before
So real soon it’s gonna wear off if I don’t drink more
I said ""OK, OK, now we’re getting somewhere
Let me come up with a scheme while I sit in this chair""
When I sat down this move wasn’t expected at all
The chair shifted and a passage opened up in the wall
Didn’t know how it had came about or where it would lead
But I had nothing to lose so I checked and was freed
Behind the walls was a labyrinth the perilous scene
As I walked through I heard moans and desperate screams
There were thousands of great beings from dimensions and ages
All trapped shamans and warlocks, magicians and sages
With prices of compensation attached to their faces
And the wages were based on their levels of greatness
The displayed every supernatural threat on assembly
When I reached the tunnel’s end, the last mantel was empty
And the price was higher than all the other’s combined
And when I looked at the name, it was non-other than mine
But the objective wasn’t earthly money, diamonds or gold
The ransom to get me back was every galaxy sold
Right at that moment, a loud alarm rang from the roof
And signs were lighting up that said “The prisoner is loose!”
I found a doorway that brought me back into the place
A giant statue where the sorcerer stood right into my face
Chills came over my body, the tension emerged
Heard the footsteps of soldiers as the quickly converged
I was surrounded and apprehended, nowhere to run
Made to stand before a council and the Sorcerer’s sons
Put on trial for destroying, and though I was provoked
On the jury was some past adversaries I smoked
Many of my greatest enemies, felonious crooks
Even the wicked overseer who had stolen my books
They were all there together on this one small planet
Not to mention my own allies, spell bounded and chanted
The potion was wearing off, time was almost up
So a hooded soldier walked in with a brand new cup
They were prepared for a stunt, just in case I would think it
Needles ready to inject if I pretended to drink it
So I reached out to grab the cup, and held it a while
Looked around the whole room as my enemies smiled
It was all over the great wizard had hit rock bottom
Heard one my past foes say “We finally got him”
They laughed loud and evil, excited and friendly
Told me that this final drink will be the one that would end me
I reflected on my whole life, the good and the bad
All the classic great intergalactic wars that I had
After all that, never thought I’d be on the brink
So I accepted my fate and then proceeded to drink
In five seconds I felt sick and weak as hell like before
My body shut down, I blacked out and fell to the floor
Everybody celebrated, all my enemies cheered
But two seconds later, the pain instantly disappeared
I stood up to my feet, heard the cowards react
Got a surge of energy and knew my powers were back
Didn’t know how but something had retracted the spell
Even my SPC soldiers had come back to themselves
We started slaughtering them all, every one of them fell
In the sky I saw a light signal shaped like a L
Then the soldier with the hood on who had gave the drink
Snatched the hood off, it was L-Dubb and she gave me a wink
She was the only one they didn’t make a prisoner of war
She had snuck in and swiped the antidote that I saw
Nothing cooler, 'cause she couldn’t have handled this smoother
It increased my power and reversed every maneuver
So now the Sorcerer’s legacy has been blown from the map
All his allies and descendants gone, his statue collapsed
All my family and comrades were safely sustained
But even after victory still, one question remained
“Why did you leave me?!” I asked her
She said “I had to, I saw the future and I knew they’d be coming for you
So I removed myself and hid in lost pockets of time
So I’d be the only one of y’all that they wouldn’t find
If we stayed together they’d got us both, no doubt”
I said “I’m eternally grateful for you helping me out”
We traveled back to Earth; ready to start all over again
And that’s the way the Sorcerer’s Saga would finally end!",https://genius.com/K-rino-wizards-ransom-2-the-final-battle-lyrics
Operation Genocide,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"We not gon' never stop this
Operation Genocide
The murderers will soon be identified
Time for what must be done

You got planes in the sky while you're watching the ground
White lines they releasing dropping chemicals down
Food you consuming loaded up with GMOs
More laws that take your rights away will be imposed
Online posts got you under cyber-attack
Now you're labelled a terrorist under the Privacy Act
Phone and internet activity, they spying on that
Now everybody's finding out what it's like to be black
You think America is free? Sorry, you're wrong dude
FDA tryna keep you from planting your own food
No convo, gang monopolized by Monsanto
No use trying to reproduce the seeds cause they won't grow
Now you've gotta keep buying, the profit's enormous
Cheating people and making money off of the farmers
Experimenting with dangerous poison to harm us
Anything pure and organic, they're taking it from us
Satan on a mission daily to see what he can plot up
Every two or three months, something getting bombed or shot up
Some say that the world's gone crazy and backwards
Some say it's all staged and the victims are actors
The schemes and the lies, the subliminal cruelty
The clues be usually hidden in movies
They show you what they plan to do to trick and confuse us
Hollywood is full of ruthless perverted producers
They sit up in the offices designing the evil
Negatively influencing the minds of the people
Our male role model gain false successes
Soon as they start blowing up, they put 'em in dresses
It's money for your manhood, company's scaring 'em
And now even these punk ass rappers is wearing 'em
On the strongest world entities we place the owners
A sports stadium is more important than the homeless
For the longest, no remorse or atonements
One of the biggest tricks is degrees and diplomas
Wars get started cause the government's greedy
Truth being overshadowed by reality TV
America been murdering for centuries easy
From diseasing the Indians all the way to Tuskegee
So now murderous gangs cover a wide range
From the immunization that they shoot in your child's veins
To the flu shot that you got, the fake food chains
The synthetic marijuana you're smoking, killing your brains
A catalogue of pills contributes to the economy
The dope house in the hood ain't got nothing on the pharmacy
There's fifteen hundred malicious mad and ornery
Ready for war, weapons and guns in the armory
A chance to assassinate the President, they wait for
Others stockpiling ammunition for a race war
The wicked chemists still practicing racist eugenics
Babies murdered in minutes at Planned Parenthood clinics
No money or resources reinforces the fear
Now we seeing 300,000 abortions a year
How much is your money really worth, let's observe facts
Go look up the Federal Reserve Act, research that
The United State's debt grew exponentially
From a billion to $12 trillion in less than a century
The dollar used to be backed by silver and gold
Now it's in rapid decline, no value it holds
The stimulus packages is an economical trap
But they don't tell you that the dollar's weak and gonna collapse
Not to mention God is mad, so he acts with aggression
Bringing storms down for centuries of death and oppression
You say it's random acts of nature, but I call that the question
Cause the scripture breaks down what America's destined for
And it's much more than famine and war
A tornado in your living room is hard to ignore
You got America, Israel, Europe combined
You've never seen this much evil in the world at one time
How did the whole planet get fooled without a clue?
Millions of people controlled and ruled by a few
They got mad at Snowden for telling what he knew
Because they don't want other countries to do what they do
The undercover racists coming out of hibernation
Protesters getting shot up at peaceful demonstrations
The Devil's honeymoon is over cause they doomed
Civil War in the U.S soon, so stay tuned",https://genius.com/K-rino-operation-genocide-lyrics
Who Killed Realness,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"I arrived at the scene of the crime and met with my committee
There was a thousand mile chalk line drawn around the whole city
It seemed like I would get the word before the world had heard it
I asked somebody what had happened? He said Realness had been murdered
I said damn, damn, damn, like Florida
Then I turned and asked the coroner
What type of horrible person would go to war with her?
Sweet, innocent, quality like Realness
He paused and then revealed that... it coulda been killed by collective mental illness
He said Realness had been missing for years before it passed
Now that I think about it, it had been awhile since I saw it last
Do y'all have any suspects in mind?
He said we will once detectives find a timeline or a sign that connects to the crime
See since the dawn of time, this statement is a fact
That it suffered when men carried out any artificial act
And anytime somebody faked off a misrepresentative statement
That flagrant hatred went straight to the heart of real and forsakes it
(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia
Who killed Realness is what we ask?
Searched all over to find out facts
I can't remember where I seen it last, damn
Nobody stepped up and took the blame
Asked for a witness but no one came
Since it been gon' life just ain't the same, damn

Now I searched around checking every dark location known
I couldn't wait; I had to do an investigation of my own
I moved hurriedly, the lack of concerns started to worry me
I found every lowlife I knew and interrogated 'em thoroughly
I was like where were you when Realness died; my mind was on the resting
After days I realized that there were too many people to question
I was baffled, so I knew I had to break it down a bit
If I can only figure out the last person that it was with
I met an old lady who told me she can help me with my search
She said she saw Realness debating with a Pastor after Church
Then she saw her leaving a motel with a woman who had a pistol
Later that night it was on TV sitting in DC with a government official
Apparently it showed up uninvited and a riot was incited
The next day I found out I was being indicted
I couldn't understand what the summon was about
But I guess on my court date I'll get a chance to find out
(Chorus) Ashlei Mayadia

When I got to court, the prosecution mentioned the life sentence
It was the first trial in history with five million defendants
To be convicted of murder, the whole public was subject
We was all guilty of it, even the judge who judged it
A thought came to me that day, is it insane for me to say
That a metaphysical quality can contain a DNA?
If not explain to me the way?
A whole population can dangerously display the same hate and simultaneously decay
Then a voice echoed through the wind and made the crowd react
It was a child; he said is there a way to bring back the Realness back?
What if everybody stopped lying and cheating and deceiving?
Started being honest even, maybe that would end the grieving
All at once a lot of chattering and bumping heads begun
Someone said it sounds good son, but it's easier said then done
The child said Realness was killed but it was you who killed 'em
But it will rise like Lazarus again inside the children

Last Man,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"When we feel like...
We don't need nobody...
Think about everybody...
Or if you was the only somebody...
Let's go

This morning I woke up out of a coma, G
Noticing something wrong about the familiar zone known to be home to me
No one was around, a scene prone to be
The silence that was roaming around me like an omen was spread globally
Was unknowingly thrown in the lonely sea
The phone I own no longer possessed the dial tone, it’s gone totally
No need for compromise or diplomacy
‘Cause at that moment the reality became shown that it was only me
Time clock erasing, I’m stressed by this observation
Depressed wondering where was the rest of the population
Loss of sanity becomes a debatable connotation
With nobody at all available for conversation
I'm chasing the explanation. Where's my daddy? Where's my mom?
Did the entire planet succumb to a nuclear bomb?
Leaving everyone who ever stood on the terrain slain?
And if the end actually came, how was I able to remain?
 x2
How much longer can I manage
Being the last man on the planet?
I don't think that I can stand it
Being the last person on the planet

The seconds become minutes and hours
No intelligent lifeforms around, so now I'm speaking to the flowers
While tryna keep my thinking imperial
Even reading is impossible without any literary material
I feed on what the planet provides me
From being internally satisfied, ties of solitude deprive me
Without knowledge to guide me, I'd be
Probably suicidal from the silence and loneliness that's inside me
Five days pass without the slightest of changes
This condition the same as I wander around aimless
Hanging by a thread of my saneness, try not to let go
I scream but the response I receive is my own echo
Now it's two weeks and because of it
I start to miss the voices of people I used to argue with
I'm on the precipice, please somebody make a sound
While in a pool of tears I drown, I pound the ground, I'm breaking down


Psychological misdirection triggered by disaffection
The effects of missing that universal human connection
Diminished family recollections
I resurrect their memories through mimicry, mastering voice inflections
As the days pass my mental impediments amass
Being the last made me aware of the irrelevance of cash
And mass technology, internet, phone, TV dependence
All that mattered now was me knowing I'll never have descendants
'Coz me living as a singular entity without women presented me
With my own reproduction impossibility
I might just take my self out willingly, cause that would be more fulfilling
Than dying from this loneliness that's killing me
Hallucinations, anger, no animals are strangers
After one month of the same nothing, I came to with a chamber
Wearing a life simulation helmet, it was just an experiment
To see if man could live alone and I failed it",https://genius.com/K-rino-last-man-lyrics
Time Traveler,Time Traveler,2006,"Extreme genius, means supreme linguist
Steam from the unseen beam, left teams spleenless
Thought schemes redeem, souls and bring cleanness
A king sleeps sixteen blings, could not dream this
Take aim shameless, rain and stood blameless
The untamed rebels I flame remain nameless
Make it rain jugular veins, it's never painless
Craniums I drain till frames became brain-less
I'm seeing far places and evil that's unformed yet
The reincarnation of people who ain't born yet
Bomb threat, tropical storm making your palms sweat
Human unicorn who ain't developed his horn yet
If you blind, follow my design and find me
Ahead of my time like I got a clock behind me
This is a class to me, you want me just ask for me
I travel so far ahead your future's the past to me

We are all time travellers
Each one of us holds the capacity to transport ourselves
To any period of existence, past present or future
The abstract method of travel is the human mind
The concrete method is our own divine bloodline
Time travel, witness it

I was there in the midst of triple darkness
In the mind of the originator, right after he brought this
Universe into existence, I witnessed
The profits predict instances that would happen in the distance
I was there when they made trips
To Africa and transported us in the holds of the slave ships
I stood next to Harriet with a rifle
And oversaw Jesus speaking to his disciples
I seen the whole slave period
And I was one of the builders of the Sphinx and the pyramids
I saw the Titanic ship sinking
And I was one of the last slaves but had no love for Abe Lincoln
I watched streets turn deadly
I kicked back and saw God drown Pharaoh in the Red Sea
I ran down court with Jordan
I even tried to warn Eve about the serpent in the garden
I built satellites that scan stars
I listened in on American presidents as they planned wars
I travelled through millenniums
I saw the Pilgrims spread disease murdering the Indians
I saw 'em bringing in cocaine
Was in the lab when they made crack and sparked up the dope game
And the first rock lit up
I was sitting on the bus the day Rosa wouldn't get up
Saw King's Dream in plain view
And I was there years from now when the dream finally came through
Me and Garvey was stepping
Nat Turner was my boy, I'm the one that gave him his murder weapon
I saw Allah murder Babylon
I was at Savior's Day when Elijah chose Farrakhan
I saw the Japanese shogun
And I was one of the Egyptian scholars that Socrates stole from

Time traveller, when me move with time-time
Time traveller, it's in me blood line-line
Time traveller, it could boggle your mind-mind
Time traveller, the universe is mine-mine

God Killers,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"These are the murderers of the prophets, the killers of the righteous
Inventors of the highest assassination devices
The thieves in the temple who weave through your mental
Deceiving the people who believe in the symbol
The dangerous grifter, the changer of scriptures, who saw the true king and then set flames to his picture
The mind infiltrator with scientific data
The man that the creator granted time as a favor
His will and his mission revealed in a vision
Fighters of this condition will get killed or imprisoned
Elimination plays made covert or flagrantly
Highly sophisticated moves by government agencies
The land of Satan waving its negative banner
A life stifled in the same repetitive manner
World of darkness harvested human organs on the market
For centuries, this agenda aims at one target

The battle for the original man’s birthright
Who’ll be victorious in the end?
Fulfilling the prophecy, hoping his plans work right
What will you do to defend?

How do they change the trajectory of your life’s direction?
The rope, the needle, the conditions are the sniper’s weapon
And if we fight, they’ll use insane counterstrikes
Attempts to drown every god that came down the pipe
They study your life and form ways to end it
How do you kill a god? Don’t let him be born to begin with
The most complex thing reduced down to the simplest
Proven success based on the use of this template
They shrink your thought volume into small microcosms
Destroy the god essence from within before it blossoms
Divisions of mother, father, brother, sister and spouses
Conditioned by the false educational slaughterhouses

They did it with birth control drugs to block the babies
They did it when they murdered the herbalist Dr. Sebi
They did it with prison, false history and addiction
They did it when they said the creator was only fiction
They did it through the rape of our women to show control
They’re doing it to the men through estrogen overload
They’ll even lock a god up for simply tryna be one
They’ll take every precaution to make sure you never see one
Chemically induced foolishness stagnates productivity
Suspiciously, the greatest gods are written out of history
Brung you silly audio and visuals to dumb you
The ensemble of your identity was hidden from you
The making of the fake but purposely prepared premise
So when you think of God, your mind produces their image
Built a noninclusive world so it doesn’t involve you
And made us hate ourselves so now we’re out here killing God too
Yeah it’s true

Everyday,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"Say man, yeah you dog
How you gon’ let the world take you out the game like that man
You better step up and be a man, homeboy
And girl you ain't no better, look at you
Laying around, whining and crying ‘bout your situation
Looking to everybody for answers
You know who you need to be looking for answers from
Feel me on this one here, this for you, listen

Ooooh-ooooh-ooooh-oooh
Ooooh-ooooh-ooooh-oooh
Ooooh-ooooh-ooooh-oooh
Ooooh-ooooh-ooooh-oooh

Let's stop tripping 'cause death don't look good in God's sight
Long as you living you got another chance to make whatever's wrong right
When you climbed out of your bed, the Sun hit you with strong light
Sleeping under a bridge out in the cold, now that's a long night
If you ain't never missed a meal or had to sleep out on the cut
Or went weeks without seeing money, you need to keep your mouth shut
'Cause folks in wheelchairs and others layed up in hospital beds
And people suffering till they drop dead without little said
I'm trying to live but even when it's hard I'm glad to survive
You waiting to die to see Heaven when you can have it alive
You breathing but you ain't living if you ain't giving no service
It's sad to see somebody check out, without knowing they purpose
You saying you suicidal, crying bout your condition
Wishing for death until you're caught slipping and placed in position
Then you beg for life ‘cause living's your natural inclination
Whatever you going through make the best of the situation
And understand..

Everyday above the ground is a beautiful day
It don't matter if life is bringing you down, just be thankful anyway
Even when the rain come or the clouds may be gray
Know you can always turn your problems around if you look to God and pray

Life is a movie that concludes with tears and no hand clapping
People ain't scared to die, the thing they fear is how it'll happen
Or where they going, the method of exit you can't choose it
Some don't appreciate life until they almost lose it
People get burned and say I'll never help nobody again
That's a mistake that go to show you putting your faith in men
Your blessings don't come from them, your blessings come from Him
So do your best to be forgiving and not so quick to condemn
Don't complain, gain your composure and try to sustain
Avoid the horizontal and remain on a vertical plain
You wasn't born high, so the truth is we don't need
Drugs and liquor just to function or cigarettes and weed
We contaminate our physicals whenever we use ‘em
Getting high disguises problems, only God can remove ‘em
Talking about how hard your life is, being spiteful and hateful
You ain't suffered more than Jesus did, so live and be grateful
And understand..

Everyday above the ground is a beautiful day
It don't matter if life is bringing you down, just be thankful anyway
Even when the rain come or the clouds may be gray
Know you can always turn your problems around if you look to God and pray

The grass, the trees, the Sun and the Earth
The uncountable amounts of breath that you took since birth
The vision that lets you distinguish the night from the day
The protection from trouble and guidance from going astray
You can overcome anything in all circumstances
Thank whatever name you calling for multiple chances
The hardest thing you'll ever do in life, no ifs or maybes
Is be born, you already did that and you was only a baby
Now you grown and got intelligence revolving in you
And breaking down because you can't handle a problem or two
Come on now, pick yourself up, you stronger than that
Quitting’s for the weak, we been pushing too long to go back
If you a single mama, there's one thing I wanna tell you
Raise your child to be the person that they father failed to
Don't let emotion get you, happiness is there if you want it
The love that you give life is the love you receive from it
Understand..

Everyday above the ground is a beautiful day
It don't matter if life is bringing you down, just be thankful anyway
Even when the rain come or the clouds may be gray
Know you can always turn your problems around if you look to God and pray

I know it gets hard sometimes
I know I know, it gets hard sometimes
But keep God on your mind
Keep him on your mind, keep God on your mind
'Cause he will elevate you, ooooh-oh
And all of the things you do everyday, always everyday",https://genius.com/K-rino-everyday-lyrics
American Heroes,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"Alright boys and girls
My name is Mr. K-Rino
I'm gonna be your substitute History teacher for the day
Right about now I want y'all to sit down and shut up
'Cause I'm about to give y'all some real history lesson
Aye boy, didn't I tell you to sit down and shut up
Alright don't make me say it no more, listen

Way back when I was a little boy, they told me about a man
Who had traveled on a ship to a far away western land
Gave him credit for discoverin' it tough it was inhabited
And quickly changed the narrative, said the natives were savages
They ravaged it and murdered the people in high numbers
His name was Cristóbal Colón
 but you called him Columbus
A sick murderous bastard who beat babies to death
But you celebrate his holiday every October 12th
Now let's move to George Washington, the decorated general
A dirty individual, his actions were criminal
Despite his wicked ways, he's elevated and praised
Mister Cannot-Tell-a-Lie, only leads 300 slaves
Understand chief, Washington's wickedness ran deep
Yeah, the father of this country's a killer and land thief
Control, power and war, only things he ever loved
But history makes him out to be something he never was

American heroes, American heroes
Everything we think we know about them needs to be rewrote
Got racists on your tens and your twenties and on your C-notes
But somehow these the ones that we seein' everywhere we go

Abraham Lincoln was a good old man
He jumped out the window with his.. nah I'm just playin'
His favoritism for slavery was self documented
Didn't want to stop or end it, there was too much profit in it
See, Honest Abe used to mock, crack jokes and admonish slaved
He only let 'em go for the Union he wanted saved
Pull out a hundred dollar bill homie and look at Ben
Then study him and see he was one of those crooked men
All of the faces that they exalted to greatness is fakeness
Did you know Thomas Jefferson was a rapist
Go and try to defend him, straight savage within him
Hated the black man but he loves smashin' his women
Sally Hemings, you'll probably trick a few but not me
Guess I got to go in detail on Francis Scott Key
If you heard the third verse of that racist national anthem
Then whether black, white or brown, nobody should be standing

American heroes, American heroes
Everything we think we know about them needs to be rewrote
Got racists on your tens and your twenties and on your C-notes
But somehow these the ones that we seein' everywhere we go

There's no doubt, United States time has been out
I'm 'bout to call these men out, get your pad and pen out
All the great Americans that you holdin' in high acclaim
I'ma tell you 'bout a few of 'em and call them by their names
These men are not worthy of praise, you've been forsaken
You won't find a more racist president than Ronald Reagan
Invasion after invasion, innocent lives taken
And countless racial epithets and off the record statements
Henry Kissinger backed by the government, he was worse
He was down to kill two or three billion across the Earth
Poor people in third world countries would get it first
All that's needed to find truth is work and research
Margaret Sanger, the human clothes hanger, a evil lady
Created 
Planned Parenthood
 to wipe out black babies
No time to call them all so go look 'em up if you have to
The Rockefeller's, Rothschild's and both them Bush bastards

American heroes, American heroes
Everything we think we know about them needs to be rewrote
Got racists on your tens and your twenties and on your C-notes
But somehow these the ones that we seein' everywhere we go

So, Tommy, how was school today?
Daddy, I don't wanna go to that school anymore
What do you mean, son?
The teacher was saying some... some saying some things, daddy
Things like what?
Well he was talking real mean about Christopher Columbus and
George Washington, it was...
I never heard anything like that before, dad
Haha, yeah that's right, if you'd taught him the truth I wouldn't have to do all that, I'm bustin' all them lies up
What are you doing in my house?
Don't worry about all that, I know one thing
He better have his little ass back in school tomorrow

I'm calling the police,

Process Meticulous,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Bioelectric signals inject your mental
When properly connected it resembles lit pyrotechnical visuals
Manifested in pixels, then compressed into physical and digital
Which lead to collect impressions residuals
You heard of my relentless certified defense
Spit so nutrient rich it could fertilize semen
Still seeking to reign supremacy
Born with the remedy to instantly convert creative energy to imagery
My tablet is a graphic app shop
My kneecaps pop open and unlock a set of laptops
Stopping my rap crop perhaps not
I got a stack of unfadeable pages somehow packed in a matchbox
As a lad my pads at it especially fast
Too advanced to even be in the exceptional class
You don't want no parts of K-Rino's flow squad
So odd and solar charged that the curtains in my home hang with no rod
To a perfect extent is the work I invent
Speed writing, combining each word with cursive and print
I take the bare basics then I raise them to rare places
Tiny airspace's that contain 80 foot staircases
Who are they to say I should do it a newer way
It's super K, it takes me a week to make it through a day
I eat lethal C4, the heat core sweeps through each floor
My neck releases it like a leaf blower
The raw crooner, universal guitar tuner
Harpooner who can make later arrive before sooner
Ideas I then pack 'em in till I'm dizzy
For me to win I'll snatch your pen from a grizzly
Thousand of written styles produces galvanism
The styles I give 'em, all the new rap algorithm
Sending it every minute with definitive winning hits
So unlimited that deep water is scared for me to swim in it
Primitive rappers get smacked when they happen to spit that
I'm the man who invented the seven can six pack
No mishap, I'm hacking you with the factual pickaxe
Got dispatched ten years after this rap that crafted this track
The euphoric impact is the same as when smokers eat crack
You list stats, my miscalculations are even exact
Though intact most of my creative faculties get jacked
Twisted acts like still leaning forward when I sit back
Can't afford to try me 'cause these wars are highly contested
My bars probably leave sores on your body
Outdated as a tape deck but K can hear your statements a day ahead
So I can repeat what you didn't say yet
Vibrant and erudite, my light wipes your internals of parasites
Each mics a million terabytes
Beat slicer for hire but they fired me in fact
'Cause my raps kept giving tracks anxiety attacks
And you responding is a fun thing
'cause I'm harder than placing two fingers in one ring
Swinging on sunbeams, I phonetically gun sling
Twenty K-Rino clones all playing on one team
The viscosity pops when its properties get hot
It hits spots on bodies and they somersault six blocks
I spin and twist plots like Serling and Hitchcock
My wristwatch shows pictures of victims when it stops
K-Rino's inner most state is so great
That even a slow rate I duplicate fingerprints and snowflakes
When I go for the title newborns know that it's vital
Old people be rocking and moaning holding a Bible
Confessions of a soul arrester
A professor could teach lessons on one of my flows a whole semester
My tongue piece as sleek as a Dunnell
You see I got at least 300 deep tunnels that funnel through my pre-frontal
And each one will leak three bundles of sheets to leave an MC pummeled
I wasn't off sick I made the beat stumble
Now they biting like bed bugs, words hit him like lead slugs
And left a gash bigger than his head was",https://genius.com/K-rino-process-meticulous-lyrics
Heightened Focus,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"Concentrate
Dig deep and concentrate
Now relax
Now get em
I stomp his head till his conscious bled
My content once it’s read drops the gauntlet on a dumb incompetent unprepared
The numbers said: we share no common thread
Stumbling and running scared even after I shredded his body from his legs
Mumbling, like you on a ton of meds
Imma spread my dominance beyond the edge of the Earth’s horizontal ledge
I wanna see these chumps in a dumpster dead
Plus I’m the one who lumbers through the haunted house hiding under the monster’s bed
That’s how I reflect on past days, I made his body mass raise
Filleted to the plasma cascades to the glass blades
I never conquered my mad phase
But back in my lab days I found a way to dash straight through a zig-zag maze
I’m more than a hybrid, I’m an enlightened oracle psychic
Who can spite for your nicest lyric before you can write it
Ignore you in crisis for inciting war with the righteous
Gorge through the night, organs I bite and absorb till you’re lifeless
Fire lyrics, like cryophoenix here is crystal clouds with Pyro spirits
Not yet invented so I’ll just pioneer this
Spiral towards my rival’s most right of spirit
My sound decibel height can be so frightening only certain types of spiders hear it
Never could love you, so you destined for trouble
Shove you in some boarding water while I’m playing and catching the bubbles
So keep your crown, we ain’t playing on equal ground
I break the people down then turn up in a corner like eastern brown
Elaborate graphics, you know K has em
Convolutedly in to ravel just like crochet patterns
I kidnap them, then I broke they talon
I got an internal navigational map that locates atoms
When K-Rino performs, they welcome me with open arms
The heat is so beyond the norm, the warmth could set off a broken smoke alarm
Ideas comin’ in in clusters, then I rush ya with an endless thrust of slugs then I have you ticking like you kin to Usher
Show blatant evil, then I make a sequel
Words escape the page
Turn into hateful eight-foot beetles and start chasing people
I spit so hard I use my first to rob
I lodge a sharp, twisted rod through sixty fraud artists and make a shishkabob
You should’ve read the newscast that said my head was growing too fast
So massive, I use trash bags for do-rags
The life-breathing poet
So deep and stoic when I’m dreaming, I could sleep inside a burning house and not even know it
They think that I’m a damn fool
I like a chance to run my hands through your face like a scalp covered with shampoo
A crump couple seconds gets you in much trouble
Two men in one: the main character and the stunt-double
When I’m in route it ain’t nothin to riff about
I got a twenty-two caliber pistol mouth that shoots missiles out
No human can absorb that
Attack eighty-four tracks then gallop off laughing in the darkness on horseback
I make your whole house topple over
Snap your neck and pop your shoulder
All by pressing B on an X-Box controller
Your favorite word sayer, angriest plagiarist chaser
Vaporize a traitor with an upgraded laser eraser
You not even a stepping stone, his neck was blown when he left his home
I get a dial tone on a disconnected phone
Bless your zone and make loaded weapons moan
And without getting nekkid prone, I’ll get your chick pregnant although she slept alone",https://genius.com/K-rino-heightened-focus-lyrics
Respect,Time Traveler,2006,"Listen, we gon talk about a word
That we don't see and hear too much, too often
Respect, yeah

Yeah you ain't gotta like me, that statement is true
But respect is when people see you when they act like they do
Stripes don't come from talking all hard
It's a whole lot of hard talkers up in the graveyard
Listen shady cats, I'll never respect em
People pull stunts on you then get mad when you check em
I send love to my real O.G.'s that died
It's some dead cats I respectmore than ones who alive
For real, fools recording these prankster joints
Lying on your records, trying to score some gangster points
Nothing but fake thugs shooting make believe slugs
Imagine every dope dealer selling invisible drugs
Respect ain't how many laws you broke
How many times you went to jail, how much weed you smoke
How many cars you got, how many diamonds up in your teeth
If you ain't real you could still lay face up in the street listen

(You gon respect me), long as I'm rolling with the God
Partner, I don't need nobody to protect me
People pulling funny moves, just to spite me
It might be jealousy, you ain't gotta like me but
(You gon respect me), and if I die
Real G I garuntee, that the streets'll resurrect me
Be who you are, things'll fall into place
Disrespect the game, watch it blow up in your face

See that's what's wrong with America, we praise appearances people stare at ya
And judge without deciphering the fabric of your character
Everybody in the hood dealing with issues
The same man you criticize, you couldn't walk a yard in his shoes
How you gon brag cause you went to jail
Your lil' mama spent your bail and never sent you mail
If she was really down, she would represent you well
Soon as you got in there, they poked you out and bent your tail
You can't persecute these youngsters, it's rough getting older
They get high, because it's hard to face that dirty world sober
But criticizing ain't gon help they condition
Instead of turning on em, sit 'em down, quit talking and listen
They turn to the streets, cause it ain't no love at home
Thinking hustling is fly, bragging and get swoll in the dome
But a real G ain't gotta glorify nothing they do
Cause if you really true to the game, the streets gon glorify you
Listen


Feel what I'm saying and try to understood good, ask yourself a question, what's worse losing some money or your manhood?
Don't be counterfeit, spit what you live
When it come to respect, remember that you get what you give
A lot of females be tripping and some of you grown
Dressing like hookers, then get mad when men come at you wrong
Some of y'all be trying to get attention with your behind
Don't understand that you can attract a man with your mind
If your body is all you got to offer a brother
What's gon be left, when y'all get tired of laying up with each other
I don't consider you a hoe but that's the image you show
Cause I'm knocking you down and we just met two hours ago
But I can't talk about nobody without checking me first
I ain't no better than her if anything I'm worse for sho
Show me respect then nothing'll come of it
Just make sure  that you don't put a D-I-S in the front of it listen

(*talking*)
Yeah, listen to your boy for a second man
The word respect means, the state of being regarded
With difference or esteem, willingness to show consideration
Or appreciation, polite expressions or consideration
Or difference, in other words man just
Give people, what you would want man
Treat people, like you would wanna be treated man
You know I'm saying, don't look at a person's situation
And judge 'em off, what you see
Judge that person, off his intentions you know I'm saying
Cause what appears, to the eye
Might not be, what's really going down
So in other words man, respect people mind you feel me",https://genius.com/K-rino-respect-lyrics
Hearing Double,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"Enemies of us spontaneously combust
Working my brain power up to flip a mack truck
Unruly sick fashion contemptuous mind
Under my shirt is a full grown Cerapter flowing lines
The mic administrator codes, I invented those
By disabling mental modes and innovative flows
For years I repetitiously spit and throw flames
Like watching a re-run the same old game
Learned that I'd be a multiple faceted amalgam
Bringing 3D data that jumps off the album
Defenceless unteachable heathens my rap will hurt you
Hold you, capture you on demand, immerse you
Unprecedented accomplishments I tried it first
Might not get it yet but you will by the second verse
Heating my rhymes so the records got inferno
Each line I got my cynical capacity will burn you

Energies I thrust run dangerously and crush
Murking the lame coward but equipped to stack bucks
I'm truly slick, cashing one infamous crime
Wondrous work visible only after going blind
Despite the imitator joes tryna mimic pros
I finagle and enter foes and inundated loads
Careers I sever viciously, split with no shame
Quite shocking cause we bomb your brain's whole frame
Turned behind me, insultable bastard in the talcum?""
Flinging CDs at a whack chump mark to scalp 'em
To pen this, unreachable regions I had to work through
Told you, that you would understand by verse two
None represented the confidence that I disperse
White hot wicked vet, cut through steel while I'm wetting shirts
Reading your mind so in seconds I can learn you
These rhymes are not identical, they're actually fraternal
Watch this one

Wrote bizarre sentences, I'm more than formidable
Close and far distances; your organs are hittable
People go frantic and hide out but none stay
Seek the whole planet inside out in one day
Deep consciousness songs, conceptually mosaic
Keep punching as long as the referee okay it
Indelible architectural lyrical bar sets
Mid-skeletal parts will exit through physical cortex
Trust my protocol, let your mind and vision marry
Plus I wrote them all with no rhyming dictionary
Consume your cerebral, run a check and improve it
A room full of people undetectable movements
The way my ideas are born no one can mention
'Cause K derives years beyond your comprehension
Disorient awful rap guys running audible thoughts
Historians marvel at my stunning nautical charts, yeah!",https://genius.com/K-rino-hearing-double-lyrics
Ain’t it Funny,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"(*talking*)
Check your boy out man
We operating on our low desires, listen

Ain't it funny, how things go
The more you live, you deal with parts of life you didn't know
Chasing dreams, and over nothing going on a limb
You bringing others in your troubles, jeopardizing them
The question is
Ain't it funny, and kinda strange
Just when you think you got it figured out, the game change
Mama said, what'll make you laugh will make you cry
Living and knowing we ain't perfect, but we gotta try

Lil' sister was fast growing up, nothing could hold her
Thugs attracted her, her own mother couldn't control her
Big brother knew the game, and everytime that he seen her he told her
Concentrate on other things, focus on men when you're older
She met a hustler, who was bad news and everyone sensed it
Some of her friends knew his history, and they warned her against it
She wasn't tripping, cause his lifestyle and his money had trapped her
But the first time that she went against the grain, he slapped her
And beat her down like a man, throwed her clothes in the street
Told her brother and with tears in his eyes, he loaded his piece
And came searching for that coward, went straight to his hood
Ready to sacrifice his own freedom, for the love of his blood
When he caught him he pistol whooped him, shot holes in his Benz
Went to jail attempted murder, fifteen years in the Pen
But for his kin, if he had to do it again he'd still get him
He wasn't gone for a month, and his lil' sister was right back with him


You met a young lady, who still possessed the mind of a girl
Full of love and trust, but sheltered and not heed to the world
Saving herself, the kind that no man was supposed to touch
Inexperienced, and had never been exposed to much
Fed her some game and reeled her in fast, you was the first
Instead of bringing out the best in her, you reach for the worst
Heavily influenced by love, she did whatever he said
He talked her in to letting another female, into the bed
Trying to live out fantasies, with a wife who was down
But what you thought you wanted, back-fired and got switched around
Didn't know, the other female was a veteran too
Who was able to do a few things, better than you
Now your girl starts to doubt you, it's no longer about you
You get home from work, and they already done started without you
You on the outside looking in, was fly and conceded
Your wife got turned out, and it's obvious you no longer needed


Over time, long relationships start to fail
Use to be easy to distinguish, now it's hard to tell
Who is real and who is counterfeit, the truth from lies
People you thought you really knew, start showing other sides
Claiming it's love but come up missing, when it's time to show
Grew up together, now you treating me like I'm the foe
Know all your secrets all the dirt you did, but kept it well
And even if we turned to enemies, still wouldn't tell
Blood sweat and tears, are mandatory that's the price
How you gon reap life's benefits, without a sacrifice
Trust in that you gotta scuffle, to come up and stack
You bout to crack, because you gave all and got nothing back
How come our children are so angry now, and quick to bust
They disappointed in this B-S, that they get from us
But you'll die, if unjustified war you seek

They keep saying don't nobody be spitting hard no more
I can name a million of 'em
Down South, East Coast, West Coast, Midwest
The UK, all over the world boys still ripping up mics
Don't let all this bubblegum rap make you believe that skills don't rule the world still

I remain dominant under the God’s same providence
Laying in flames I gain top levels of pain tolerance
Brain’s popping from mass jugular vein blockages
Lots of the people I kidnap wanna remain hostages
Humans in boxes in my lobby and packaged beside me
Immune to toxins, I could probably do crack as a hobby
Mad cause I be hard to defeat, should’ve practiced karate
When his blood saw it was me it went back in his body
His style is rented, I wallow and follow y'all at a mile a minute
Ridin’ inside a copter with no pilot in it
I’ve been the deepest elitist MC
Compete with unthinkable speed and three illegal secretive breathing techniques
I’m sweeping those who would be opposed
My seed’ll make the fetus grow a half a foot every week with no GMOs
Predisposed to be a pro, at three years old I was even cold
Tougher than getting a zebra to wear people clothes
He was bragging and reenacting his evil tactics
I creeped in fast and I beat his ass with an Easter basket
Killer for hire now you under artillery fire
My umbilical cord was an auxiliary wire
The only time I’m in my happy place is when I’m in a rapper’s face
Sledgehammering ankles like I’m Kathy Bates
Matters if the cops is around, spot you in town
You ass out like a hospital gown
Like Kurt Vonnegut, written work I got a ton of it
A speeding car, I’m on the front of it like a 6-foot hood ornament
I serve trouble, thousands of birds huddle
Swerving as I show down dark streets doing a word puzzle
I'ma shank till he chokes and he faints
Like a teller getting robbery notes in the bank, you hope it’s a prank
My complete procedure freezes ether then defeats your leader
You won’t heed it either till I bleed and beat ya and Saint Peter greets ya
It’s hard to get out of my powers like flaming houses
Murder falling out of the clouds 'cause it’s raining couches
Mechanically designed to think straight with a backwards mind
So much pH in my bars I call 'em alkalines",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-barbarian-lyrics

I'm the guardian of the word cathedral
You never heard an equal, murderous verbs seeds spread this evil
Before I create a thing G, I got a let a lab tech screen me
Lock me up, quarantine me and clean me
My conscience bombs come from eclectic directions
When you speak I respond with phonetic electrons
Any man who infringes ends with the millennium of vengeance
For him and ten generations of Hendrick
To try to follow or swallow my chance
Is like getting stung on ya tongue by a colony of bala ants
The oesophagus  auras this metamorphosis
Started with my entry through a parallel universe's orifice
I bathe in Insanity Lake
Blended a typhoon with the earthquake and made a calamity shake
I got a pianist who plays keys on 23 planets
MCs vanish, my unborn seed already reads Spanish
I was last seen in a bad dream
Took out an ad explaining everything in a paragraphless magazine
I aggressively wipe out destiny, see my recipes
Consist of seven leagues of diseased manic depressant bees
Don't send your troops to my mental institute
You left the womb nude, I was born wearing a ninja suit
You see my wand so put K-Rino on
I'm a poisonous human Cuban Solenodon
MCs relent and move like I increase the rent
A thousand people sent across a continent on a single piece of lint
Under these pretences, my thesis is relentless
My recent rap sequences decreases your lead senses
No speakers from no preachers or defenses can prevent this
Flows reaches the most deepest dimensions, yours go three inches
The only writer from a biological asylum
Where no other living items exist in my phylum
I tune in with one open ear like a stethoscope and hear
A million conversations being spoken clear
Premeditated sick things, how can I injure 'em?
Aggravated swing swing guillotine pendulum
From macro to __ I collects brains and scan 'em
The phantom who barely whispers and shatters your tympanum
The vocally graphic athlete, whose massive feet
Trampled and smashed your street and casket half your fleet
Strike you cause my mics a tribal rifle, expedite you through cyber-cycles
So it takes 'em light-years to light flight you
Your liable for the writing of unrighteous Bibles
I'll appear before my rivals twice the height of the Eiffel
This chapter has no more laughter
See you got it backwards like placing Omega before Alpha
My word torture enter the Guinness
Men have never reached the finish of it because the beginning of it is endless
At the root like a gentle hygienist, I'm the mental violinist
Who pens symphonies every five minutes

The first time the laws taught them boys put in the lick
There was 4, 3 of them ran but 1 wasn’t so quick
Took him down, asked him questions, beat his ass with a stick
But he stayed true, no snitching and did 5 for the clique
Came home thinking about paper, so his mind was at ease
100 grand split up 4 ways, that’s 25 G’s
That’s the come up they had made 5 years in the past
Told his partner in a letter, give my mamma my cash
Came to find out his mamma ain’t seen a dollar, “Say what?”
Called his boy on the phone, “Man, where the fuck is my cut?”
“Man, ain’t nobody got nothing, all the paper went fast
Had to use most of the loot to keep the cops off our ass
But fool charging ‘cause I got something new in the fold
About to come up on this million if you down you can roll

But they caught him so now he facing time in the hole
But when the shoe was on the other foot, that bitch told

Point Blank

So trust no one, he might be a Fed, hear what I’m saying
Trust no one, keep heat by the bed, you think I’m playing?
Trust no one and what’s heard and said
The only way that two people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead
Trust no one, these wannabe ballers ain’t legit
With the “goo-gabba-gabba”, that baby talk shit
Trust no one, never leave home without your strap
And watch what you say, your phones might be tapped

My homeboy got married a year ago and straight settled down
Got a visit from his partner that lived out of town
He said they kicked him out his crib and now he out on the street
“Man, I just need a place to stay till I get back on my feet”
“It’s all love fool, you know that we go back to the dirt
What’s mine is yours player, chill until you find you some work”
His wife busted in the room, damn near ready to strike
“Why you tell him he could stay here when you know I don’t like him?”
“See baby, this my boy from way back so how you gonna front?
I ain’t say nothing when your sister lived with us for a month”
She bumped her gums 10 more minutes then walked out the door
“If he ain’t found nothing in 2 weeks, then his ass gotta go”
He stayed down with his partner, 2 weeks and a day
Woman plexing her ass off, but he still let him stay
Came home from work early ready to hop in the sack
Opened the door and caught his boy boning his wife from the back

So trust no one
, he might be a Fed, hear what I’m saying
Trust no one
, keep heat by the bed, you think I’m playing?
Trust no one
 and what’s heard and said
The only way that two people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead
Trust no one, these fake ass brands will bring you down
Take your kindness for weakness and run it in the ground
Trust no one, watch who you give a helping hand
‘Cause that’ll be the same nigga to bite you in the ass

Don’t matter how much you say, it’s what you say that’ll hit
I’d rather have an ounce of knowledge than a tonne of bullshit
I’d rather have a lot of money than a bunch of new junk
I’d rather have one true homeboy than a clique full of punks
Time is money, but time ain’t always what it appears
Now you crying for the one that only lived 20 years
But before you start stressing ‘cause he no longer living
Ask yourself, what did he do with the time he was given?
See circumstance made him victim, though his life was shady
He lived more in 20 years than some that make it to 80
When you look back on the drama in your life and who got ya
20 times out of 21 it's usually your partner
For a man, what’s his downfall? Some paper and ass
For a woman it’s the same thing, a trick and some cash
You can recognise the rats up in the mix when you smell ‘em
Too bad the dead victims couldn’t come back to tell ‘em..

To trust no one, he might be a Fed, hear what I’m saying
Trust no one
, keep heat by the bed, you think I’m playing?
Trust no one
 and what’s heard and said
The only way that two people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead
So trust no one
, he might be a Fed, hear what I’m saying
Trust no one
, keep heat by the bed, you think I’m playing?
Trust no one
 and what’s heard and said
The only way that two people can keep a secret is if one of them is dead
Trust no one, CPOs and managers
The number one cause of big career damages
Trust no one, keep your composure, settle down
Third coast, the world coast, I guess y’all know that now",https://genius.com/K-rino-trust-no-one-lyrics
Maniacal Manifesto,The Maven,2013.0,"Okay ladies and gentlemen
Next coming to the podium we have little K-Rino
Who will doing a speech called ""The Maniacal Manifesto""
Please welcome him with a warm round of applause
As he comes to the stage and does his little song for you

Once my flow and me espoused, K-Rino will be aroused
Crowds gather in amazement as I'm lowered from the clouds
I'm so artful it should be unlawful
I record your life so I can fast-forward or pause you like DVR's do
The flawless grand martial, who imports volumes of thoughts from rap law school
And gives you minutes to memorise what I've taught you
I'm prolific, inventive, unlimited
Demented and so intent with the sin of my pre-eminence I swim in it
Fast as a light flash, I swing the mic past you and dash
Leaving a gash in a meteorite mask
Nuclear isotones in my microphones
I use them for slicing stones and manufacturing Gaboon viper clones
Extremities I cut those, juxtapose them in bowls
Swallow your pieces then regurgitate you up whole
I might resort to a cyberthought
And taught you so extreme that your life support machine will need life support
 x2
It's the skill, the words, the pull that grabs you
The sickness, the volume, the voice that stabs you
The idea that broke through, forcefully provoked you
Maniacal manifesto, the hand that chokes you

You throw me off the podium? Please
Folded MCs, I carry mics on a chain like custodian keys
K-Rino don't need herbal upliftment
Cause every night I'm delivered a different shipment of lethal verbal equipment
Style impressive, wild and aggressive, issuing private lessons
Teaching how to draw invisible person composite sketches
Vivid as gold, keep delivering blows
Till your brain is imposed on by the bridge of your nose
No vision, I think you need your eyes cleaned
So I'm comprising a combination of gasoline and Vizine
From the planet, the dumb are banished, I swung my hand and once it landed his stomach looked like the inside of a pomegranate
Fact spitter, habitual hat splitter
Who attacks and granulates you into sacks of cat litter
I enter keys, print it out, then I leave
Three thousand degree vehement fevers when I sneeze
 x2

I told your fans I'm the coldest man
I grow and then shrink you down to size and hold your clan in a Folgers can
Nervous and strain, I'm like turbulent rain
Serving your slang every two minutes interpreters change
Perfectly trained removable and reinsertable brain
Air strikes with word flames make convertible planes
My memory is so astoundingly cool
That I can view a full pool then tell you next week if an ounce was removed
I engrave raps under wave caps
Plus every day I run around the equator for 108 laps
After that, a hundred cats I'll bomb up
Erase a whole population before the Sun's up and that's just warm-up
Verses, you get bladed for just taking one
My phrases penetrate your tongue like a battery powered staple gun
And once the front and backs complete
I turn the same page over and it's blank because I write on everlasting sheets
 x2",https://genius.com/K-rino-maniacal-manifesto-lyrics
I Don’t Think,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Say, little fellow, come here, let me holla at you for a minute
Yeah, I see you be out here doing your thing man but
A lot of the stuff we do, it ain't to be glorified man
Cause they got a plan for you bro
Listen

Street game revving up, money, can't get enough
Goons showed up and wet him up, partners set him up
Smoke runs through your lungs, this life is new to some
Two to one he already knew how to use and shoot a gun
Killers wanna go to war, living like there's no tomorrow
Youngster stole a car, crashed in it, didn’t roll it far
Project cannibals, anger understandable
Like animals, it's hard to fathom what a desperate man will do
Crime they done did it all, twist, break and bend the law
Many men involved, it's like you're at a gangster seminar
Pretty slabs coming down, prostitutes running round
Marijuana found about three or four hundred pounds
Scared cat in cell, somebody fed a tale
Swat team came, Grandmamma even went to jail
Spending life hoping, wishing, getting pills, no prescription
On a mission, little babies born with a dope addiction

I don't think you wanna live this life
The dope selling, the pimping, the jacking, that's played out
You only got a little time to get right
The streets gonna lead to the jailhouse or getting laid out
I don't think you wanna live that life
The blood on your hands, the looking over your shoulder
You only got a little time to get right
The fourth quarter of the game man, it's almost over

One more bird might lead to your third strike
Judge said 55 years, yeah, you heard right
Now you got a new fight, welcome to your new life
Whole world ruined, that's what happens when you lose sight
Tryna prove something led to you getting handcuffed
The follower's always the one who gets jammed up
Now you want to call God, all good, that's cool with me
But why you wait till now, you should have did that when you was free
Hate, you personify, keep it up you're gonna die
Last thing that you should wanna do is make your momma cry
Bragging about hustling, you're proud of your silly trade
Making three or four hundred a day, thinking he really paid
Capping when you're on the scene, tryna get up on some green
You don't understand you're just a player, you don't own the team
Locked down, so you face an unreachable due date
By the time he realized the truth, it was too late
(Chorus)

Hell is what you're about to pay, hope there's something I can say
Might put some wisdom in your head and move you out the way
Gotta put yourself in check, everybody want respect
Hard to get a job with a pistol tatted on your neck
Nothing's what you're gonna get, say you good, wanna bet?
Son looking at you what example are you gonna set
Bad habits by the father, wanna pimp? you're out of order
Better treat your women right, especially if you've got a daughter
It's gonna take a strong hand, better check her phone man
She online sending naked pictures to a grown man
Out jacking with your friends, should have tried to better them
Now you're doing life behind bars for a set of rims
Soon as the Sun is out, ghetto babies running about
He can't even count but he knows when them Jordan's coming out
Everybody trunking lies, won't nobody compromise
24/7 whole hood either drunk or high

If Words Could Kill,Time Traveler,2006,"Your whereabouts will remain confidential like pass-codes
Your body'll be harder to find than Black players on the Astros
My motto is if they want war blast em
Your on the mic hollering and lying just like a fake orgasm
People stand before me try'na define my storyline
The hurricane rhyme I designed was a category 9
What K-Rino talk it's like I'm a sprint you a slow walk
Me losing can't be done like a bald man try'na grow a Mohawk
My flow is kinda like jacking off and that might seem odd
Cause in order for you to beat it (what) you gotta be hard
I'm that hovering crook, killing fools with a smothering look
I go outside the lines like a blind man with a colouring book
My vocal cords are contained, the picture frame in a hall-of-fame flaming
My new name is sequence because my styles keep changing
Come off the mic, you ain't holding that too right
You got the crowd sleep like a child at twelve-thirty on a school night

If words can kill, I be driven to see
My enemies murdered by deadly flows given to me
If words can kill, that would be a vision to see
Cause if they could, nobody would be living but me

Am I the roughest you ever heard, well there's no need to wondering
I raised the bar so high that a airplane can fly up under it
You can't shake us, fakers hoping they break us
But I'm pulling more cards than a poker playing in Vegas
You standing calm, cool, collected, but you soon to be nervous
Weak rappers get done for hours like community service
You exaggerate your win rate, so get'cha lies straight
I'm ten times tighter than Yao Ming's foot in a size eight
Listen (uh) you know I'm stalking so you wonder where K went
Me reckon you is overdue just like your light bill payment
I spit on individuals, chances you got's little
They'll be calling the ambulance to rush you thoughts to the hospital
He didn't even have to face these skills (why)
Cause he got executed by the ghost of AC Chill
I'm a rip you with this verse and when I finished the story
You goin run off the stage crying like a baby mama on Maury

If words can kill, I be driven to see
My enemies murdered by deadly flows given to me
If words can kill, that would be a vision to see
Cause if they could, nobody would be living but me

K-Rino's the brain cell repopulater
And my mind contains more lines than a telephone operator
I grab a glass (to what) purpose a toast to ya
And mentally murder the family member that means the most to ya
I think on the level that only can be comprehended on alien nations
I'm murdering rappers with telekinetic paralysis thought penetration
Blast my enemy, out of the vicinity
Mentally superior energy rhyme chemistry
Too many want to be in proximity
But no sir, feminine flows are no kin of me
Whoo I got juice in me, but I ain't young as I used to be
I shoot words (?) emcee Bruce Lee
Scientists trying to reproduce me
I make emcees choke, (a few see?) if I burn I'd use cables to boost me
I schedule your burial with ease and burn ya like a venereal disease

If words can kill, I be driven to see
My enemies murdered by deadly flows given to me
If words can kill, that would be a vision to see
Cause if they could, nobody would be living but me
Dope-E is a lyrical assassin
K-Rino me I'm a lyrical assassin
Klondike Kat is a lyrical assassin
Tela Roc is a lyrical assassin
Rob Fellaney is a lyrical assassin

Point Blank is a lyrical assassin",https://genius.com/K-rino-if-words-could-kill-lyrics
Exhibition Prototype Ultra,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"I'm the walking hydrogen bomb, I didn't apologize 'cause I meant harm
Prior to killing rappers I make 'em sign a consent form
You been warned, I'm defacing you as graceful as Lynn Swann
I write until my limbs fall off, this is my 10th arm
Reincarnation of every great who's ever been born
Storming the stage donning the mask of Agamemnon
The windstorm, I think beyond what is normal and then some
Ritalin from a sick pharmacist couldn't keep my pen calm
Of all the writers, I'm the wisest known
I can dial up spirits from the other side from home with a high tech Verizon phone
Address my rivals in a violent tone
Got flown to an asylum 'cause when I got grown I wouldn't leave the knives alone
I got to sleep and have deep dreams
My unbeatable speech brings enough released heat beams to crease jeans
I see things like birds can  flying with 3 wings
And walk the streets with full-grown people hooked on my key ring

Raw in my exhibition, war is my next decision
Hard is my definition, I started your extradition
I'm the one in charge so no cause to request permission
Blessed with diction so I quickly soared to the best position

I wrote the most tumultuous eulogium
Some at the podium divulging him at the ghost rapper symposium
Condolences for soul invention notices
For every poet a poet is froze in the throes of vocal hopefulness
The only thing that he wears is a plastic bag
I've mastered the magic task of drinking the empty portion of half a glass
I seek a mad sinister beat and scold it
My verse I don't need to hold it, I'll read as I wrote it if the sheet was folded
My head's a sacred place to be
People paid booking agent fees and waited patiently for vacancies since '83
And once I reach my concentration peak
Cake and sleep on a freeway a week and amazingly screeching brakes won't awaken me
I may not have a song that rocks the club or sell lots of drugs
But still my skill is hard as lacing shoes up wearing boxing gloves
And when I start to sparking topics
I knock holes in optic sockets that create pockets larger than walking targets

Raw in my exhibition, war is my next decision
Hard is my definition, I started your extradition
I'm the one in charge so no cause to request permission
Blessed with diction so I quickly soared to the best position

For big payments my statements are parlayed
With one call made I traded my tongue for a jigsaw blade
No one's this hard, I still play when you hit pause
And dislodge 206 bars and give 'em out like gift cards
Outside of my apartment  sit
I'm one deep in my thoughts but it sounds through the door like fur pits in an arguments
They made me in a factory, ladies embrace me naturally
They paid me 80 G's to let them name their babies after me
My adversary's weak so I actually let him capture me
I fasted for a week then I slashed him when I was fast asleep
The crowd is doubtless, thinking about what my mouth spits
Under my suit, I've got on 20 more outfits
My bars are kept in the farthest depths
I chop the hardest reps while walking 40 steps without using my quadriceps
Ran through your clan like an intravenous strand
The only man who can jump and simultaneously land

Raw in my exhibition, war is my next decision
Hard is my definition, I started your extradition
I'm the one in charge so no cause to request permission
Blessed with diction so I quickly soared to the best position",https://genius.com/K-rino-exhibition-prototype-ultra-lyrics
No Time,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"I’m just tryna win and make my mama proud
Ain’t got no time to hang around that drama crowd
The game ain’t what it used to be, I’ll let ‘em run it down
Then got the nerve to wonder why I never come around

Fake smiles, kissing ass
No sir, I never believed in that
Crash dummies taking losses
Letting people put keys in your back
Showin’ up, tryna cap
Everybody want that photo op
Your whole life is like a fake picture
Touched up, airbrushed and photoshopped
You ain’t foolin’ me, you foolin’ them
I can see right through, don’t get it twisted
You on Instagram, flashin’ money
But in real life, you ‘bout to get evicted
No need to lie, what’s the reason why?
You wanna cross the bridge, you gotta pay the toll
Knowing very well that you a fairytale
Now you lost your soul, tryna play a role, I'm like
These sneaky bastards don’t respect the game, they cheatin’
They say they happy for you but they mad you eatin’
But when that check come at that restaurant, they be glad you treatin’
I’m ‘bout to scroll my contacts and do some mass deleting

I’m just tryna win and make my mama proud
Ain’t got no time to hang around that drama crowd
The game ain’t what it used to be, I’ll let ‘em run it down
Then got the nerve to wonder why I never come around

Some people just want the green
Some just like to front and be seen
Cloud-chasing just like a fiend
Might hope for fame and everything between
Lyin’ ‘bout how clean you are
I’ve seen your crib, I’ve seen your car
Doin’ everything backwards, you’s a clown
We screamin’ peace, you screamin’ war
Rap about how you sellin’ drugs
Talkin’ ‘bout you be killin’ the club
Roasted your ex on social media but everybody know you still in love
Hey boy, you need to try not to flex
Wonder what lie you droppin’ next
You said you don’t beg and cry for sex
But old girl already screenshot the text
So when she posted that, you got roasted, black
A pimp, boy, you ain’t even close to that
You be whinin’, cryin’, lookin’ like a five year old, that ain’t how Gs supposed to act
Flippin’ out on y’all I might have to start to
I’m tired of females that like to argue
If I ain’t feelin’ you, I might avoid ya
But you lost your marbles if you think I borrowed ya
My mind is hard to read, they say I’m stupid smart
My game is tight as 1980 hoopin’ shorts
Everybody lookin’ at K-Rino to get it poppin’, when are you gon’ start?
I can’t do everything but I’ma work and do my part

I’m just tryna win and make my mama proud
Ain’t got no time to hang around that drama crowd
The game ain’t what it used to be, I’ll let ‘em run it down
Then got the nerve to wonder why I never come around

Jealous people won’t stop pursuin’
They always watchin’ what you doin’
Hate and gossip, what’s it provin’?
I’ma throw the peace sign and keep it movin’
Hood classes, no hall-passes
Tongue lashes like gun practice
No respect for y’all bum asses
Droppin’ shade like sunglasses
I keep my hand in the passing lane
The whole game is so backwards, man
The facts are too hard to ascertain
Because your friends and your enemies act the same
All the time I gotta grind for profit
Never showin’ out, tryna pop it
It ain’t no use in me lyin’ ‘bout it
Hell, if I ain’t got it then I ain’t got it
I don’t fake success, I let the rest pretend
Every month, you gotta stretch your ends
Hopin’ that in-crowd let ya in
Goin’ broke to impress your friends
Packin’ all that weight on your shoulders
Car repos and foreclosures
The bed, tv and more, soldier, gotta take it all back to the store, I told ya
Now question, what’s wrong with bein’ real about the situation?
Can’t take you serious if you cap or if you fakin’
I be ignoring what you sayin’ ‘cause it’s misdemeanor
Plus all of that’s beside the point, like my middle finger

I’m just tryna win and make my mama proud
Ain’t got no time to hang around that drama crowd
The game ain’t what it used to be, I’ll let ‘em run it down
Then got the nerve to wonder why I never come around",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-time-lyrics
No Fly Zone,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Bread in the stash, anything to save a buck
Not Madonna but like a virgin, I never gave a fuck
Catch a Brinks driver raid his truck
Again I'm not Madonna but my crown's like a virgin I never gave it up
With no contact, foreheads I bust open
Once again I'm not Madonna but like... nah I was just joking
I'm known to bogard frauds and smack hard
I always keep it real, I never front like a back yard
Rap polar bear, slap you with a solar flare
Your soul, I go in there and open you up like a folding chair
The ability and greatness that I hold is rare
I strike every part of you I even leave you with swollen hair
I'll invite you to the square but you don't wanna come
You're so dumb you wear your pinky ring on your thumb
Flow until the Great Wall fell
From my lyrical headlock you couldn't break loose if you was all Hell
To think you can battle and win, you is nuts
That is harder than getting dread twists at Supercuts
Losing ain't in my vocab, my friends say
Thursday to Monday's gone, everyday is Wednesday
Hit him so hard he woke up in the next state
The second time I hit him he landed on the next date
Out of place like a checker player yelling, ""Checkmate!""
Boys don't wanna see me like a Betty White sextape
I'm known to spit with mathematically nifty wits
I'm impossible shit like a seven way fifty-fifty split
I'm that old crazy dude on the house
Word clarity greater than yours with food in my mouth
You're in disarray, no victory dissing K
Instead of pistol play I'll just fry you in a skillet like a fish fillet
Hot enough to give the Sun a tan
Like a 6 foot roof to a 7 foot man it's hard for me to understand
Or stand under, most rappers are known to beg
I'll leave your car alone and put a boot on your leg
K don't stop fighting till he win
I can stand behind a camera take the picture and still be in it
When my folders overcrowded then it's time to expand
Ran out of paper so I wrote rhymes on the line of my hand
The best way to describe K on the verse once the beat's right
I see green after it's read like a street light
Don't tell me I'm the best I won't be surprised
It's unnecessary like a blindfold on Stevie's eyes
I was tried for the massacre of Eighty Mics
My skills are crazy fight, yours is ladies night
Better make sure you pay me right
Cheating me is a bad idea like a sandpaper baby wipe
I'm from a place where we hide flows in the next life
You from a place where your sister is your ex-wife
You wanna see a brain splat I can arrange that
A penny for your thoughts, I'ma need some change back
Faster than cheetah feet, too loud to be discrete
I'm so focused that I can actually see the beat
I don't bawl out of control and then fold under
But I do go through paper like a hole puncture
My mic strap leaves heads in a cowards lap
The first of every month I take a thousand hour power nap
I never trusted men as far as a yellow school bus
With ten fat kids could get moved by a gust of wind
I kidnapped the rapper, set ransom at twenty stacks
His family gave me twenty-five not to send him back
I get through to people words hit the body quick
You never connect like a legless karate kick
Skin starts stinging from the drama that I'm bringing
And I knew that it was over once your momma started singing
The steel prodigy, people would rather hear me tell them bad news
Than hear you tell them that they won the lottery
The only compliment from K-Rino you'll ever get
You're probably the best weak rapper I ever met
You came late homeboy class been in session
You fools will never learn like waterless swimming lessons
Eliminating you before a minute passed
Look on the bright side, at least you were the first person to finish last",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-fly-zone-lyrics
Problems,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Yo what's up? Hey look here
Everybody got problems
Everybody go through things
I'm tired of seeing everyone walking around here acting like they the only one who got drama in their life
So I'ma lay it out for y'all
That we all got problems man
Now look Kim

We all have problems
We know only God can solve 'em
Just try to find a way out
But life only brings us down

You ain't the only one that's going through things in this life
I been stabbed in the back 5 or 10 times with the same knife
But there's 2 things I learned being up in the game scuffling
Never cry over spilt milk and complaining don't change nothing
What you think about when you look at K-Rino?
You ain't gon' meet too many MCs that been through more
I slaved to get a shot, gave but never got
When I'm gone I want Underrated engraved up on the plot
Like it or not, knowledge I kick, haters I hate 'em
Fans that I got, God knows how much I appreciate 'em
They kept me going through times when I started feeling doubt
When my tape was in the store and fools was asking, ""When you coming out?""
""Man, it's out"", that's frustrating to see
But then I realize this game is much bigger than me
It's bigger than Rap, materials and bigger than pride
Bigger than a set of rims on a brand new ride
I'm blessed to be alive 'cause I got plenty partners that died
And on my way home I see people that's sleeping outside
Realize that there's a difference between a man and a coward
Look at the struggle, ask yourself, did God cause it or allow it?

We all have problems
We know only God can solve 'em
Just try to find a way out
But life only brings us down

People used to fight now they blasting quick
Alive yesterday, today getting your casket picked
A multitude of different drugs got the masses sick
For a faster lick a girl will sell her ass to tricks
Young ball player built his name, got him some fame
Gave it up to sell dope and try to make a little change
Got shot for tryna sling on the wrong terrain
Now he's sitting up in a wheelchair watching the game
Young girl ain't but 16, already in drama
Just found out that she's pregnant and scared to tell her mama
Tried to grow up too fast and her wish came true
Now getting an abortion is what she's tryna do
But understand this little mama and feel what I'm saying
God gonna make a way for you just focus and keep praying
Time to be a woman now and do what it takes
Even though you didn't plan it, God don't make no mistakes
It ain't up to you, although with the decision you wrestle
You ain't the one that gives life fool, you only the vessel
The same way you get to live, breathe and try to advance
That life developing inside you deserves the same chance, uh

Now let me say this to these dyslexic rappers here in Texas
Just because you just rapped don't mean you just wrecked this
Everybody think they're a rapper but that ain't so
It's like the human mind, there's places in it you can't go
Just be real with yourself, you ain't the microphone type
You just another wannabe that's caught up in his own hype
If the words that you're saying ain't touching the next person
Then when you on the stage all you're doing is rehearsing
It ain't about just being up there, hollering and getting loud
It's about dropping heat and getting props from the crowd
I stay in the field hard, January to December
I done forget more verses than most rappers gon' remember
See the purpose of the game is to entertain people
Not to stand up there, scream all night and drain people
These the same people claiming up and down they was the hardest
All I wanna know is who the hell told you you was an artist
I was blessed with instinctive God-given insight
To catch player hating vibes but I don't trip, it’s all right
I still be cool with ya, you still a buddy to me
I know you hypocrites be at the crib studying me
Actually thinking that you hard or talking 'bout I can get it
But they don't know I'll bust him up and whoever he bring with him
I'm an old pro, been in the game and I still clown 'em
'83 to 2003, that's 20 years counting, fool

We all have problems
We know only God can solve 'em
Just try to find a way out
But life only brings us down",https://genius.com/K-rino-problems-lyrics
Too Many Rappers,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"(Intro)
It's that part of the album where feelings get hurt
Something gotta be said, I might as well be the one to say it
(Verse 1)
What the hell is the matter with these crazy fools?
Been spitting 7 months, talking about he paid his dues
Rappers everywhere I go there ain't no escape
These days the crackheads are dropping mix tapes
The radio got you cut and they're spinning it loud
Go to a show, nothing but other emcees in the crowd
Most of them can't spit a lick but some of them can
Nowadays man, the artists outnumber the fans
It's the retarded sounding artists that's causing the trouble
And the ones with real skills getting lost in the shuffle
Swear up and down you're in the top three the way you're bumping
Making it hard on the ones that's really saying something
Every day another born and more I found recent
Twenty rappers in your clique and only one that's sounding decent
And don't get it twisted, he ain't no hell of an artist
He only stands out because his homeboys is so garbage
(Chorus)
There's too many rappers, every city, every nation
Some of y'all need to find another occupation
Fill out an application, go work at a gas station
But put the mic down because it's fantasies that you're chasing
(Verse 2)
These fools be watching 106 and Park when they get home
Trying to figure who's the next clown that they can clone
Instead of trying to be innovative with styles you're dropping
You set out to copy somebody already popping
7 albums still ain't made you no cash
And your rotten homeboys won't even tell you it's trash
They're sitting in the studio with you night after night
You come out the booth say ""how that sound?""
They be like ""Yeah, that's tight""
But in reality, they're scared for the truth to come out
That your vocals sounding like you got a boot in your mouth
Why don't you try your hand at something else (please)
Go and sell some Avon
Them nursery school raps sound like you wrote that shit in crayon
And I ain't acting like I'm platinum though I'll rip the best up
But damn at least I sell every unit that I press up
Your friends don't even buy your music, I ain't joking
You got boxes from three years ago that still never been opened
(Chorus)
(Verse 3)
Can't hardly give your stuff away, I don't know how you survive
Yo, I've heard of three for ten but damn homie, three for five?
Your lyric writing, it ain't all that precise man
You might need to try just being a hype man
You're not qualified to stand with the mic in hand
See it's about the tightest flows, not the tightest pants
And never step to me because what comes out my mouth will roast you
You're better off being that dude who's passing out the posters
Rhyming ain't for everybody, still a lot have tried
Truthfully only a handful are qualified
Talent level on the bottom side
We should colonize and force them to have their job descriptions modified
Plenty of music in the streets but we don't trust who made it
And that's the reason why the fans are so frustrated
Case closed until you come up with some sicker flows
Trash rappers on every corner just like liquor stores
(Chorus)
(Outro)
See, don't feel bad, man, there's a lot you can do in the game, you ain't gotta rap. You could produce, you could shoot videos, you can design album covers, man, you can be the dude that carries the equipment... all of that, man, there's a place for ya. Just put that mic down",https://genius.com/K-rino-too-many-rappers-lyrics
Nobody,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"The ground is crumbling, the sky is falling
This phone is fully charged up but nobody's calling
When you realise the shoes people walk in don't fit 'em
When the bright lights fade out, the friends fade with 'em
I remember what my mother said when I was a young G
She said, ""Don't nobody in this world love you but God and me
They'll give the appearance of loyalty then betray you
And you can't control what they do, just make sure that you stay true, boy""
But then I walked into that (Walked into what?)
Doing for others and getting stabbed in my back
They say, ""I love you, man"", ""I got love for you"" and then they bring you down
I came to learn that's just a word that people fling around
Conveniently use to see what they can get up out me
What percentage of my people truly care about me
""Nah, K, I'm with you till the end"". That's what they all say
Over time I'm learning the hard way, that..

Nobody loves me, nobody loves me
Out of all, I can't think of one
They only use me, they only use me
For things they need to get done
Take all my money, take all my money
In time they show me their ways
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me
That ain't true, it just feels like that some days

Most of my sacrifices usually end with me the regreter
I can think of times in life when strangers treated me better
Everybody been deceived, took for granted and lied to
You should never fall unless somebody falling beside you
I used to look in your face, now I'm just staring through it
Husbands and wives, close friends, even parents do it
My heart is wrapped up in stone because of these false betrayers
Every time the truth is show it adds another layer
You tried to keep being real, but that never worked for you
Love ain't what a person says, love is what a person do
Break the cycle, cut him loose and resist a spell
Of people that I'm talking about, am I on that list as well?
Helping them daily, but no help they gave me
Now I'm left with nothing, sitting up in this corner looking crazy
Y'all, the smiles was corroded, every compliment was loaded
Now I know that most of the good deeds where covering up a motif

Nobody loves me, nobody loves me
Out of all, I can't think of one
They only use me, they only use me
For things they need to get done
Take all my money, take all my money
In time they show me their ways
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me
That ain't true, it just feels like that some days

The concerts, the videos and TV interviews
The false affiliation follow the money that you lose
When everything was cool, you had an entourage behind you
But once you got lost, not one of them tried to find you
And that should only serve to remind you
That a snake will do absolutely what he's inclined to
Sneak in, slither and sidewind is what their spines do
And snakes don't have spines, but y'all get it, you know the kind who
Be standing with you when your status is strong
But when you in trouble, you look for 'em and all of 'em gone
Provided the atmosphere for all of them to shine
But in the midst of all the traffic, alone in your own mind
I'm never mad when the true colours of people get revealed
I be glad 'cause it's a blessing finding out who ain't real
Do I try to work through it or separate myself instead?
Is it true or is it all just in my head that..

Nobody loves me, nobody loves me
Out of all, I can't think of one
They only use me, they only use me
For things they need to get done
Take all my money, take all my money
In time they show me their ways
Nobody loves me, nobody loves me
That ain't true, it just feels like that some days",https://genius.com/K-rino-nobody-lyrics
Aesthetics, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Word aesthetics, the veteran with a nice word fetish
It’s imperative that I shred him up like iceberg lettuce
I strip the Earth naked plus I perfected my work ethic
The first second, the nurse gave my mother my birth record
The precocious quote theologian
I read notes that repost and the results leave throats in convulsions
I’m overpowering, don’t have to shout at men to be louder than them
Plus every now and then I’m inverting my outer skin
Disavow any sour doubters who out to deflower our power
Slip in his house, kill him in the shower
Swinging a meat cleaver, the people become believers
‘Cause I’m still breathing with a 300 degree fever
Speak with a street sweeper, heat seeker, the complete leader
Other beat bleeders think a million leagues deeper
Every night that we write, we strike beats precisely
And not even Vanna White can flip words like me

Yeah and I don’t care about none of you
I’m walking in straight gunning you
I wanna make you uncomfortable
I kill ‘em all so wonderful
I don’t care about none of you
I’m walking in straight gunning you
I wanna make you uncomfortable
I kill ‘em all so wonderful

I’ll travel a mental landscape
Metacarpals I break flat as a pancake, Superman handshakes
Eating Bran Flakes while I make plans to straight take your fanbase
6’4’’ human with an ant face
Catch you in the neck with a deadly projectile
Wretched and wild just like Siberian exile
I prove that you can lose, I choose acting a fool
Practicing moves like putting toothpaste back in a tube
The speed of my hands let ‘em know I had to be the man
Bobbing and weaving my head in a moving ceiling fan
If you keep playing, I’ma get him for at least a grand
Keep expanding my lethal clan ’til his preacher ran
The traveler navigating through the 2035 calendar
Scavenging for a certified challenger
My methods are the best that you ever saw and able to wreck and slaughter
‘Cause the recorder filed a protective order like

Yeah, and I don’t care about none of you
I’m walking in straight gunning you
I wanna make you uncomfortable
I kill ‘em all so wonderful
I don’t care about none of you
I’m walking in straight gunning you
I wanna make you uncomfortable
I kill ‘em all so wonderful

My fortress is real, they don’t know what it costed to build
The force of my skill will toss two horses across a field
My organization’s elevation is real close
Doing heart operations while the patient is still woke
Yeah I’m bragging, my brain acting as a magnet
Attracting higher thought activity even when it’s stagnant
Keep my deepest cerebral increments in a bag with
Heated pieces of plastic equal to lethal gases
My microphone has at least 23 components
The trophies that I keep at home got real people on ‘em
You trigger booms, invisible stick in ligature jewels
I got twenty-five hundred and two signature moves
I’m too far gone, before I enter the war zone
I drink a gallon of extraterrestrial hormones
Rappers fell strong like a 300 pound hailstone
When they saw me call the ghost on a spiritual cell phone like

Yeah, and I don’t care about none of you
I’m walking in straight gunning you
I wanna make you uncomfortable
I kill ‘em all so wonderful
I don’t care about none of you
I’m walking in straight gunning you
I wanna make you uncomfortable

Don’t Stop,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Ha, look at how they looking at ya
Can’t you see, how they be looking at ya
They so mad, look how they looking at ya
Come on
Ha
Look at how they looking at ya
Can’t you see, how they be looking at ya
They so mad, look how they looking at ya
Check it

Now as I walk through the room, it’s natural I suppose
I can feel them haters looks burning through my clothes
But I disregard em, catch me a position on the wall
Despite the envious and jealous wishing that I fall
I been studying since day one, yeah homie I got you
You hate me 'cause you ain’t me, and I thank the Lord I’m not you
On the cool it’s the truth, so I’m putting you on blast
If my body is the car, then your hating is the gas
Once you think it I just drink it, that gives me an advantage
I fill up everyday, and take a cruise around the planet
I never make it hard, I win by keeping it simple
Is it that time of month, you must be on your man menstrual
I know it’s you, but don’t worry I won’t bloody you
The thing that trips me out about haters, is how they study you
I could give a reason, or I coulda listed fifty
He probably mad, 'cause his girl wanted a picture with me so

Don’t stop talking, don’t stop lying
Keep on bashing, and I’ll keep flying
Keep being mad, and I’ll keep laughing
'Cause y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
Y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
'Cause I’m still hard, while you softer than a mattress
Steady getting money, skills sharper than a cactus
Y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice

You could stand below, watch me elevate above
I’m still smiling, so y’all gon’ have to hate my love
I’m the truth, like the needle on a lie test
They mad, cause they don’t understand the process of progress
Answer this, how come you so upset that I’m blessed
You don’t like it blame God, he did it so why stress
They concentrate on how I talk, act and how I dress
Maybe they just wishing they was more like you K, I guess
You ain’t doing a good job, of being a hater fool
Your grades is slipping, they gon’ kick you out of hater school
And throw you fools some moves, that’s colder than three below
You need to step it up, if you gon’ be the CEO
Wait, someone should help you rehabilitate
Your mind state, from that hatred that you illustrate
With your snake mouth, slug you can miss me
I bet your daddy, hated on my daddy in the sixties

Don’t stop talking, don’t stop lying
Keep on bashing, and I’ll keep flying
Keep being mad, and I’ll keep laughing
'Cause y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
Y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
'Cause I’m still hard, while you softer than a mattress
Steady getting money, skills sharper than a cactus
Y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice

Keep telling people that I’m trash, like you ‘spose to
Keep mean mugging every time you see my poster
I’m still accomplishing thangs that you could never hope to
While I keep getting doper, you at home looking at Oprah
You still slandering, but my status never drops
Every time you hate I get greater, I hope you never stop
How do you hate homie, let me count the ways
You the type of dude to tell the roaches where I sprayed the Raid
People are so afraid, check out what you said brah
How he get a girl that fine, he gotta be paying her
And when a woman hates, look how tight her mouth get
Mad because you look good, and she can’t afford your outfit
Now you wanna disrespect just to get your point across
Sick because she shop at Macy’s, and you barely going to Ross
Keep talking down I like it, I’ll never lie to ya
'Cause after God, I owe everything I got to ya

Don’t stop talking, don’t stop lying
Keep on bashing, and I’ll keep flying
Keep being mad, and I’ll keep laughing
'Cause y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
Y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
'Cause I’m still hard, while you softer than a mattress
Steady getting money, skills sharper than a cactus
Y’all ain’t even hating right, y’all need practice
(*talking*)
Ha-ha aw man, at the end of the day
I’ma need y’all, to keep doing what you doing
Cause I don’t know how I’d make it without ya

Overkill,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"You been impacted and attacked with a mixture of aromatic paragraphs
Graphed with acidic cataclysmic mathematical acrobatics
My mind confines plenty rhymes
Slice your stomach with the mic twenty times, even lines on your torso that look like mini blinds
And people could peep through and view your vital organs anytime
A psychic told me I won't come into my prime till I'm 129
I'll lesson ya
Body mass from flesh into a watery mist and spray you out of can like air freshener
I won't have any problems stopping ya
The one man mafia that's chopping ya till I filet ya like tallopia
My Glock spits nero toxic hot bricks
My synopsis make rocks split, block hits from unseen entities that I box with
I hold a key like locksmiths, got X-ray optics, grew thoughts I get
Sit outside my knowledge pit cause they could not fit
My virus too strong to call off
I could stand on one foot on a building ledge in a strong wind and couldn't fall off
I spark the seas that are hard to read
I'm from a larger creed a martian breed that turns caution offers to quadriplede
The strap cannibal that rap fannels
Like states on the Animal Channel that traps mammals in the annals of my neck panel
The docotomy, my word logic locks you
And stops you from breathing out until the death angel adopts you
You wanna have it, take a stab at it
I'm avid about smashing your cabbage into specks of forensic lab fabric
Impostors copy my logic, my body and knowledge
To your body's composite from solid to liquid to gas and back to solid
An apocalyptic flame rips
From my lips at insane clip, that strips fragment and many micro grains and brain chips
I distribute facts amongst ya
The chiropractor that replace needles with multiple axe in your back for acupuncture
The inhabitant of the labyrinth Babylon
Paramount paragon and ones we layed marathons with 90pound batons
And spark suns 'cause I been hotter
The Bin Laden sin plotter that'll beat your ghost out of you like a pinata
My information, level contagious
Blazing abrasion that had you phased with radiation like a chemo patient
When average rappers scavenge passages from my tablets
I ravage anatomy savage and won't even let the maggots have it
Don't try to draft the chapter after me
You'll think you levitating but you'll be actually hanging rope defying gravity
The word merchant that squirt serpents with a flow pump
Lyrically I'm the opposite of a hurt workman 'cause I get's no comp
Your verses are worthless
My thirst is strong enough to cold Earth's water from the Earth's inner core up to it's surface
I'll leave a generation birthless
Carry hearses in other dimensions while being nourished by the milk of shirtless nurses
You quoting stuff that ain't potent enough
I seen a ghost of the rhyme you wrote leaving out of your rap folder and floating up
Like Ike I beat and bruise the mic if I use it right
You gon lose tonight and every pen you choose'll go on strike and refuse to write
I'm overseen by wicked guardians
Which enter me after every performance and make me slaughter part of the audience
I never finish a battle, one paragraph they blue
Just like a phone number, most rappers dash half way through
I designed the rhyme, my wits that I could of read at first
I didn't get a chance, people were screaming and giving me dap before I said the verse
I'll speak to your brain and tremble it
The skim of it I'll dismember it, blow up the frame and let a baby reassemble it
Skills that are doping 'em with opium
The trophy I'm accepting while my victims head lay hopelessly on a podium
{Outro]
Go on say it dog say it, you cried huh
(nah), you so mad you cried right you did
You did mayn, you cried
Shit, you were mad then a motherfucker
You cried nigga, you cried

Change Yo Ways,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"The day was Saturday time bout three-fifteen
I'm leaving out the corner store I couldn't believe this scene
This girl approached me slowly spoken ask me, ""Don't I know you?""
I said, ""You look familiar."" She said, ""What school did you go to?""
I said, ""Oh yeah, the face I remember but the name I've forgot
Back then your frame was hot and my my girl you done changed a lot""
She said, ""You crazy boy, times have changed I'll admit it""
""How come you out here posted up?"" She said, ""I'm just tryna get it""
I said, ""Well anyway how you been?"" She said, ""It's funny you ask
Looks like I'm gonna be struggling as long as this bad economy last""
She said that times were really hard
""But if you give me fifty dollars I'll let you get a hundred in groceries off my car""
I started thinking, how she used to look over me
And openly walking around acting like her boo-boo smell like Gerri POperry
She was noticeably roaching for cash, no longer had looks that kill
Even though I was holding some old school grudges I ain't crazy I took that seal

See y'all trifling and lazy, others half crazy
Woman you ain't slick you need to change your ways
You ain't gon' get no cash from me, ain't gon' get no babies
I'm a shut you down no ifs, ands or maybes
See y'all trifling and lazy, others half crazy
Woman you ain't slick you need to change your ways
You ain't gon' get no cash from me, ain't gon' get no babies
I'm a shut you down no ifs, ands or maybes

Now, I met this other female, she was nice at first
It started good and then she went from bad to twice as worse
I had a premonition (uh-oh) soon I would see a clue
Gave her my number at 3 o'Clock, she called me at three-o-two
She said ""I'm just checking the number me and you know they lie""
I said, ""Alright I guess I'll talk to you later, okay, bye""
Went out to shoot some ball I didn't even notice at all
My phone was blowed up and loaded y'all, twenty-four missed calls (man)
I called her back ""what's wrong is someone trying to murder you? ""
She said ""I was just worried boo, I hadn't heard from you"" (oh)
I said ""you crazy we just met and I'm already tired of this""
She said ""You sounding like my mamma, ex, and my psychiatrist
She started screaming, yapping, going off, cussing and snapping
Ten minutes later, called me back acting like nothing had happened (what)
Girl, what the hell is the matter with you, you ain't none of my spouse
Three hours later, she's was camped out in the front of my house

Oh my goodness

Come on, come on, come on Sniper answer the phone, man

Come on Snipe; pick the phone up, mayne

Man
 Hello?
 Hey, hey, what's up Snipeman
 What up?
 Ay this crazy girl is posted up in front of my house, mayne
 Say what?
 Ay you gotta help me figure out something, come over here mayne, do something for ya boy, mayne
 Yo, I got'cha homie
 Man this girl crazy as a Bessie bug
 Yo, I'm on my way
 Aight...

Before I end this there's a few things I figured I mention
Going to clubs is like attending a gold-digger convention
Walk up with no paper tryna mack it'll spell disaster
And why the hell you in the strip club, girl I'm a tell yo pastor
Was at the mall frontin' like you had lottery bread
Even though you got that jail caked up at the side of yo head
She tried to bend over and show what she had and was worst (uh)
In a red disconnection notice fell out of her purse
Plus the purse was fake the dude made you believe in it
Not smart enough to know that Gucci got two C's in it
Seen her in Timmy Chan, looking like the Boogerman
Lying to your friend about some house that'cha brought in Sugarland
Stop tryna be something your not ya frontin' steeled you're homed
Them shoes look like yo great, great, great, great, great, great grandma owned them
So maybe after hearing all this, you can strive now
All she had was four dollars at Winders cost five nooow

Yeah

The Galactic Quest for the Mystic Ten Volumes,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"La da la la la
Man what the...
Noooooo, noooo
Please tell me this ain’t happening
I can't believe this
No no no
I gotta be dreaming
It can’t be real
OK, OK, get a hold of yourself

I rose up in the afternoon, 2PM approximately
Stumbled to the dresser where my t-shirt and my socks be
Put my clothes on, something in my head stopped me
My senses were tingling so I started running top speed
Ran into my writing room, “Woah, there’s been a robbery”
No money was missing, but my lyrics I could not see
Ten rap books gone, just an empty box, G
With a photograph of ‘em and a note saying, “We got these”
Flew into a panic, can’t believe what this is saying, man
Called the Rapper K and Sniper, “Haha, quit playing man
Bring my Black Books back, that was smooth”
Both of ‘em got real serious, said “We ain’t got ‘em dude”
Flew into a rage then I tore the whole apartment up
I was livid by the time the police started walking up
Asking dumb stuff, now I’m getting mad at ‘em
Stupid questions like, “Where’s the last place that you had ‘em?”
So I kicked them out, no more playing around, too much time has gone
Went into detective mode, let me find them on my own
Every composition that I wrote in life gone, man
Hell would break loose if they end up in the wrong hands
Life as we know it, every aspect is in whole doom
A switch in my apartment turned it into a control room
Looking for a formula, to go crazy, I wanted to
Tried to watch the night before footage on the monitor
Saw nothing, it’s like the thief was invisibly camouflaged
Or surveillance footage was either doctored or sabotaged
So I sprayed the areas with luminol additives
Plus I magically reconducted finger print analysis
Soon I’ma know who it was, that’s what my computer does
With the technology to extract finger prints through a glove
Got some, let’s make a case, seconds later they were placed
Into my universal informational database
First step to make the catch, every planet was dispatched
Screens started lighting up and beeping, “Woah, I found a match”
Ten faces popped up, I saved them on a cartridge
My folders had been stolen by the Ten Masters of Darkness
They wasn’t from this planet, from far reaches they landed
A underhanded intergalactic clan of bandits
Who travel through the altitudes and practice wreaking havoc
And for thousands of years they’ve been uncaptured and active and
Just to be descriptive, their team consisted
Of the Leader, four of his sons, two women and some triplets
They were dangerously intrusive and trained to be abusive
And it angered this heinous things would shamelessly come do this
Then my screen began to whistle, the visual got dismal
Then the sound of the Leader’s voice intercepted my signal
He was mocking me, saying “Now, you’ll never out rhyme us
And now we’re all on different planets, good luck tryna find us”
Then the picture blacked out, the whole system lost power
To reboot and start over took five or six hours
They already had a head start, but I gotta pursue ‘em
I reached out to my connection on Neptune who knew ‘em
He said, “To get a strategy, you’re probably gonna have to meet
The lead overseer of the Andromeda Galaxy”
I said, “Well honestly, my ship is barely running, G
Could we do a FaceTime or maybe he could come to me”
“Absolutely not,  you have to roam the Universe
And if you want him you must leave the Earth and visit him in person”
But I’ll need a different travel method, time is of the essence
My ship is primitively fueled by chemical propellants
The distance that I have to go is so far and infrequent
Which means that it would take a million years for me to reach him
So to cut down on time and to accelerate my motion
I borrowed a ship powered by photon propulsion
I met with the Overseer seven days in a row
Travelled all them miles just to hear him say he didn’t know
“What?” I stormed out, left the place irate
Seven whole days lost, let me do this my way
Since I had the prints, I double checked ‘em when they gone through
I linked ‘em up to which species and planet they belonged to
Made it to the first spot, surveyed the whole place
Books 8, 9 and 10 were locked inside a gold case
Guarded by the triplets, carefully protected
Holding weapons that could vaporize me in less than a second
I started using voodoo ventriloquism to confuse him
When they left to go see who's inside the castle I removed them
I took off towards the exit, they looked and started chasing
A trap door was lowering to keep me from escaping
They were shooting, at the last second I slid and that's the best part
The door dropped and instantly chopped all three of their heads off
I travelled to the next planet, a world I'd never been in
To get the two folders that were taken by the women
I located their patterns, broke inside and started creeping
I searched and found 6 and 7 while they were sleeping
They woke up to found their books gone, giving cold stares
The plan was to make them both think the other stole theirs
I cleverly divided them, it worked because at 5am
I watched them blast each other from the room that I was hiding in
Mashed out, fast still, still laughing at the last plot
To the third planet which I hoped would be my last stop
This place was familiar, but I flashed back when the war's done
Didn't see the leader but I ran into his four sons
They knew who I was, so they loaded up and challenged me
Having four of my books made them confident to battle me
I said ""I'll take y'all one by one, the loser gets his breath took""
I'll battle y'all in order starting from weakest to best book
They said, ""Best book? This was never indicated""
I said, ""You mean to tell me y'all don't know which book's the greatest?""
I watched the jealousy creep in, I said ""I thought you knew
It could be 5, 4, number 3 or number 2""
Not knowing they all equal, I set them up for the fall
I let them destroy each other as they fought to claim them all
As I gathered them, I laughed and wrote my name across the wall
Right then and there, my phone rang and in came a call
""I've been watching you the whole time, your plan was well done
Even though you took my soldiers out and wiped out my sons""
He appeared right in front of me, in a haze of ether
I said ""I recognize you, you're the overseer
Now it all makes sense, you a snake, no question
No wonder you told me you didn't know how to catch him""
He said, ""I let you make it because I knew you couldn't win
I knew what you wanted, I could've wiped you out then""
I said ""I'm coming after you to smash you like a boulder
Because I'm mad that you robbed me and left me with one folder""
He said ""One folder? I thought that there was ten?""
I said ""No, I have a master book, you missed that one, my friend
It contains inconceivable lyricism and flows""
Then I pulled it from my trench coat, it lit up and it glowed
He asked me to recite a verse from it, and so I ripped
The effect caused a powerful universal eclipse
He said ""Look, I'm sorry that I ever did invade you
I'm open to negotiate for that book I'll trade you
I'll give you this one if you give me that one with the skill""
I said ""10 is greater 1, okay it's a deal""
I let him have the master, then I left fast as hell
He opened up the folder that I gave him, then he yelled
Because the master was a fake, no supernatural styling
Just a note that said ""Gotcha"" and a picture of me smiling",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-galactic-quest-for-the-mystic-ten-volumes-lyrics
Us,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"We at the point where
We gotta start doing for self
No more time to point fingers
And place blame
Lets Get up

We out here trying to dodge prison, In the valley of decision
One foot in this dirty world, And the other in religion
Relationships are broken, because everybody's roaching
And most of them are still hanging, just going through the motions
Unity is dying and money problems persistent
Nobody wants to work to get on top, they want it instant
When we get it, we abuse it 'cause we don't know how to use it
And usually as soon as we do, we foolishly lose it
Before others you question, first do a self assessment
Because what you hate about them you might be a reflection
You wonder why you're grieving and no success you reaching
The way you are is shaped by the company that you keeping
You negative and sensitive and dwelling on the worst part
And every time you don't win it's always someone else fault
And when it fall apart and your plan get that hole in it
You blame the world instead of acknowledging your role in it

Still going through so much
Every thing's tough on us
No feelings, no love, no trust
Everything's rough on us

Don't be gassed by the flash in this world, it's all fraud
See a humble man rises, the arrogant fall hard
Friends will sell you out fast and they've proven it's true
'Cause you riding for them that don't mean they'll do it for you
And to the few that suffer to make sure everyone else straight
It's crazy because my love for them is stronger than they self hate
Meanwhile I'm practicing on getting it right
I might be the worst person that I ever met in my life
These con men, they gonna have to come again like a re-release
I break ties with fake friends like it's 3 a piece
How can I trust that I'll be good in the long run
When everybody at my intervention need they own done
I think I need some more time to assess this
Waking up from 8 hours of sleep and still restless
I'm having a big bash for me and everyone I mess with
Got a blank sheet on my desk (What is that?) My guest list

Still going through so much
Every thing's tough on us
No feelings, no love, no trust
Everything's rough on us

Somebody need to give the judge a jail sentence
So he can know how it feels to live in Hell with us
I know you see us as animals, dumb and lower status
But we don't deserve all that time you throwing at us
You got the game so rigged we almost gotta lose
Locking us up for selling something that you probably use
You want slavery so that's the solution
See it's still legal if you in jail, that's in the Constitution
They come home to no jobs so they return to you
Dollars needed, so they get popped for tryna earn a few
And we don't take responsibility, we burn em' too
Mad at what our children do when we the ones they learned it through
You think you're balling 'cause you got a chain and car, you dumb
The true baller is the company you bought it from
How come we hate each others shine, what's a matter dude
But once I lose you got that, ""Better him than me"" attitude

Still going through so much
Every thing's tough on us
No feelings, no love, no trust
Everything's rough on us",https://genius.com/K-rino-us-lyrics
Ultimate Flow,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Filling the mold, killing a bowl by drilling a hole well in a skull
And blow torch your asshole when it's freezing cold
Stage a raid, invade with a blade, made a killer spade
Still I sprayed and slayed your crusade
Witness a mercenary vocalist high jacker
Attacker of a weapon packer, voluntary mind cracker
Scandalous venomous lyrical freak play-by-play analyst
Psychological stable staged panelist
Ran a list of every women and man it be, demanding me
Handing me mental methods that fuck with my sanity
The murderous parasitic avalanche thought are harder than froze water
Our side, kicking the hoes the first quarter
Lyrical ghost arisen, my brain trapped in a prison
Conjured a vision of a verbal mack truck collision
Truth and veracity, never diss
None have outlasted me, 2000 cubic foot brain capacity
Mastery advanced terminology, geology
It's quantum leap biology, all that shit follows me
Swallows me up mentally burning me, internally shooting and fiending
Proceeding, tongue bleeds for eternity
Massacre whacker vernacular, quick
I'm articulate smack the shit out a vic with hard ass boots I kick you with
Domination, every station's facing incarceration
The posters are paces of lethal cyanide inhalation
Causing ragged enemies attack and I catch it
Lyrical lifejacket, terrible acrobatic knife hatchet
Running past, I slapped a brother who jocks us or knocks us
Unmask his ass like Mil Máscaras
(Hook 2X)
Ten in row, twenty in a row
Thirty in row, forty in a row
'Ultimate Flow'

Systematically translating South Park sounds
You ain't down with the sound then you drown underground
Radical dramatic attic acrobatic contortionist
Stomping, enforcing this fist cause I'm a larcenist arsonist
Brain patterns posses manipulation of medicine
Mental multiplication, universal expansion
The verbally volatile, viscous voice irresistible
Super vigorous villain, vocal invades you invisible
Just me in a barroom, I'm Steven Seagal
I get even with y'all, talk shit, now he's not breathing at all
Dedication to victims of a rougher nation
Suicidal somersault, psychological suffocation
Thoughts pathetic, yours hypothetically theoretic
Persistent pressure pumps, bring a personal paramedic
Decipher the script of this hieroglyphic hypnotist
Jealous motherfucker hit my face and it ripped his fist
Equivalent to a brass knuckle brick storm
Bullet fighting bee swarm, verbal Vietnam bomb
Bone breaker of lyrics, paralyzing and crushing it
Mentally perform brain surgery without touching them, yo

What I Gotta Do,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"What I gotta do
To make you see I stay true and get some love back too?
What I gotta do
To show the whole world that I did it all for you?

A lot of men went astray, so my head bends when I pray when my mindstate's in disarray
But at the end of the day, I wanna make sure that I said everything I intended to say
Then again in a way, sometimes it's better just to chill on tape, put your grill on safe
‘cause the real gon’ take what you sayin’ to heart
But the people that wanna break it down still gon‘ hate
So I might as well go and shoot straight with ‘em
It’s only winners and losers, I was raised in a place where it’s only two ways it works
Either the bait catches the fish or the fish gets away with the bait
No in between, you either wearing the ring or tap on down the road like Ben Vereen
An endless scene with suspended dreams
Eventually you appreciate the simple things
Life’s waging a bad war
A lot of it’s happening fast so I gotta focus and get in the lab more
I see through ‘em like glass doors
I got people mad at me for not taking advice that I didn’t even ask for
My last resort is to get my passport or do me a Nascar with some miles on the dashboard
Maybe a fast horse to take me out of this bottomless pit
Because in real life, I done had a crash course
Listen I'm worn down, do anybody know the score now?
My motivation’s sinking the lower ground
I’m hearing these poor sounds and realizing every single day that I ain’t got enough patience to go around
So a little introspection might be necessary to press me in the right direction
I notice whenever I stop studying, my brain gets muddy and I need another life injection so I’m asking

What I gotta do
To make you see I stay true and get some love back too?
What I gotta do
To show the whole world that I did it all for you?

My name is like dust, it blows unnoticed forever
K is the real deal, my skill ain’t a bluff
My catalog’s up on the beast to release seven CDs in one day and it still wasn’t enough
No attention or no mention from any publication or station
Deep in the underground is where they bury me
Thirteen quality projects in two years when most of these rappers releasing one every three
So how the hell is he or she considered to be G.O.A.T
When I repetitiously body and DOA beats
If you listen diligently, eventually you’ll agree
No lyricist in history has been consistent as me
It’s a higher peak, I mentally aspire to reach
When I’m being penalized for my desire to teach
I’m still writing the heat but man, the fire is weak
Even contemplated turning in my retirement sheet
Why should I keep depleting myself, extending my limits
When it’s only appreciated by a mini percentage?
But plenty of men have seen it so anything with a critic who fails to even mention my spittin’, I get offended
But then again again it goes back to the premise that artists never walk in accordance
‘cause I never needed commercial endorsement or reinforcement to properly validate my importance
So with that said, I’ma acknowledge the people who still rockin’ with me though it ain’t really about the cash
The people from all over the planet who manage to get whatever I manufacture whether present or past
I put too much effort into my craft for me to have this slow amount of love when I be givin’ my all
So if I say right now that I’ma put the mic down, I want you to know that it wasn’t because of y’all
I’m asking

What I gotta do
To make you see I stay true and get some love back too?
What I gotta do
To show the whole world that I did it all for you?",https://genius.com/K-rino-what-i-gotta-do-lyrics
Didn’t Ask,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"(Couple arguing)

Man, I wish that y'all would of stop fussing
Speak to each other without cussing and have a grown up discussion
Cause every since the first moment that I got here
The plot turned chaotic and the true reason was not clear
Daddy's going off daily, Mommy starting to nag
I felt more comfortable when I was floating in that water bag
Just laying as serenity, now any time y'all in the same vicinity
You go to war like enemies
But the night I was conceived and both of y'all were embracing
I couldn't wait to leave and seek placement
Racing with billions more chasing
Just anxiously waiting to be placed in that sacred destination
And once I came into fruition and witnessed y'all crying and kissing
I never envisioned being in this position
Proper attention I've been missing
Even though I can't talk yet I'm still wishing somebody would listen

I just wish that y'all could see clear
(Man, I just wish that y'all could see clear)
Cause I didn't ask to be here
(Straight up, I ain't even ask to be here)
Why can't you understand me?
(Seems like nobody understand me)
I just wish we was a family
(Straight up)

I don't think it's right for us to be thrusting deep
In a hateful battle over custody because of me
Sometimes I wonder man, am I the blame?
I overheard my mama claim she had me too early and wishes I'da came
A little later on in the game
She talks about regretting ever meeting my daddy and giving me his name
And while they arguing over all types of things
I'm crying for my pacifier plus I need my diaper changed
My daddy left without kissing me, do he hate me?
And ever since that day he left I really haven't seen him lately
Now mama's on the phone every night talking to my auntie
About how much money she gon' get monthly
And I've been sick all this week, I ain't been breathing right
And now we riding round with some new dude that I don't even like
He tryna treat me like I'm his but that's too much to swallow
He ain't my daddy, when he try to pick me up I holla


I'm witnessing the dissipation of this relationship
Now my time with Dad is only weekend visitation
No love in the car, just struggles and wars
And next couple of odds, look at this trouble I caused
I speak perfect in my mind, I can think without saying
But when I try to say it out-loud, it just comes out like ""Whaaa""
The beef showing no signs of squashing, can't y'all see I'm watching
Y'all should of just put me up for adoption
And what the Hell was Daddy thinking
When he sent his new girlfriend over to my mama's house to get me for the weekend
While they was on the front porch cussing and loud talking
I'm standing up wobbling, ""Look mama I'm walking""
I look at 'em and pray in plea, see I'm hoping one day they agree that main purpose from A to Z was raising me
And even if y'all relationship burn out
Think about how y'all hatred is gonna make me turn out",https://genius.com/K-rino-didnt-ask-lyrics
If I Could Do It All Over,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"If I could reset my game, man, I’m tellin’ y’all
I’da listened more instead of thinkin’ that I knew it all
A lot of things that I did this time, I wouldn’ta done it
And a whole lot of cats in the hood I wouldn’ta hung with
If I had a second chance, I coulda gathered my thoughts
I’da never messed off the good women that I lost
Maybe I coulda prevented looking through a fool’s eyes
Had I utilized patience and chose to choose wise
All the licks that I hit, cash I ran through
Coulda bought acres with all of the bread that I blew
Woulda woke up out my slumber and focused on my numbers
Woulda showed love to those I never showed when I was younger
Somedays I just imagine, wondered what woulda happened
Mighta kept playing football and never started rappin’
Probably triple my mail, cleaned up where I failed
Try to save all the homies that died or went to jail

If I could do it all over
Let me explain facts
I woulda changed this, I woulda changed that
If I could do it all over
Soon as I came back
I would’ve avoided some of the same acts
If I could do it all over
Let me explain facts
I woulda changed this, I woulda changed that
If I could do it all over
Soon as I came back
I would’ve avoided some of the same acts

If I had knowledge of self then the truth I could prove
I might’ve made a different move and dropped out of school
Who knows? Maybe I woulda packed up and left Texas
Woulda made sure that I never met half my exes
Reliving that time in a different state of mind
Woulda stopped eating swine back when I was eight or nine
All the losses applied for tryna be a nice guy
I’d never ride with those I got burned twice by
Wouldn’ta cussed so much on my first CD
Woulda read more and not watched so much tv
I’da took more steps for us to truly be free
I’da probably made sure I had two or three seeds
All depends, I woulda been smarter with my ends
Woulda stayed close to most of my childhood friends
At a early age I woulda become a food grower
Ain’t a day that goes by I don’t wish for a do over

If I could do it all over
Let me explain facts
I woulda changed this, I woulda changed that
If I could do it all over
Soon as I came back
I would’ve avoided some of the same acts
If I could do it all over
Let me explain facts
I woulda changed this, I woulda changed that
If I could do it all over
Soon as I came back
I would’ve avoided some of the same acts

The past is unattainable
It does no good to dwell on the unchangeable
The energy you waste on time that slipped away
Could be used to improve your situation today
What you did is what you did and what’s did is done
Accept it for what it is, can’t be changed by none
Stop reliving the guilt and focus on forward vision
Take bad decisions, flip ‘em, convert ‘em into wisdom
If you coulda altered what you did by one fraction
You mighta ruined your life by changing that action
The things that you missed out on were not for you
You might’ve gotten rich but the money mighta destroyed you
You wishin’ for the past like that will lead to correction
But God keeps you from certain things as a protection
The wins and the losses should be used for learning
And everything you did was all part of the journey

If I could do it all over
Let me explain facts
I woulda changed this, I woulda changed that
If I could do it all over
Soon as I came back
I would’ve avoided some of the same acts
If I could do it all over

Twisted Graphics,The Maven,2013.0,"It's so confusing
Let's take 'em back to the old school
Where we played the game with no rules
Long before Pro Tools

In one hour I predict that your flow will be dirt worthless
I'm too great to raise Hell, I'll just lower the Earth's surface
I play with the skills, most are not able to deal
I smothered his photograph and he suffocated for real
K usually says things that leave my opposition truly scared
Forget rice I'm spewing hot Uzi lead at the newly weds
Deep as the deepest sea, born to write frequently
And that's the reason I got an extra set of hands where my feet should be
Nothing you speak is new, my speeches turn the people blue
Cut myself on stage and make my body fluids leak from you
The big bread cutter, what I utter can make the Feds stutter
Nano diamonds skull plate, meteorite head butter
Once I arrive it's little talking just simply slugs
Soak it in waterless tubs and drink it from empty jugs
So who can test will be my next question
They discovered it's just festering inside a vest in a rest room at a best western
 x2
Every verse I have is, loaded with twisted graphics
Lyrical instant classics so intricately crafted
Wizardry fully packed with powers and mystic magic
People are lifted by the greatness of each gifted passage

Attempts to stop the spell would probably fail
They found parts of his body shell inside a well on a beach in Cozumel
Me losing to coward frauds, that's about the odds
Of a jouster's sword hitting an octopod from 7000 yards
Each day between the time of 3 and 6
I usually read a list of weak MCs to diss and eat 'em whole like feeder fish
Once you cock your tongue and blast your mouth
I'll gladly you send you down the fastest route from a living person to Casper's house
I'm proud to be a spit boss, it's hard to get lost
Because my alternate universes don't run parallel they criss-cross
I think you should've been a cover girl
I'll choke you till your brother hurls
Then hide away for 9 years in another world
I had to shoot paragraphs at you, attributes are absolute
So now they dragging you out wrapped up in a new plastic suit
I gets it done, K the magnificent gifted son
Doing crossword puzzles with ten languages mixed in one
 x2

The superfluous man, heal you like a herbalist can
Murk you in front of your daughter because I heard she's a fan
With complexity I'll possess you if you let me
Best to address me correctly, I was scared of myself too when I first met me
I'm heartless now, don't believe me you can call around
The horrid sound gets louder the lower you turn the volume down
My dictionary words are scrambled G, not listed alphabetically
Which means you gotta hope to find them randomly
I write my anthems on trampolines
Hold you with my left hand and keep beating you with my right hand like a tambourine
The gasoline is doused, somebody costing their spouse
Two in the morning I'm setting fire to an arsonist's house
Massive bigger monographs are blasted via rapid trigger
Spent my childhood playing with serial killer action figures
I'm not an average human
Looked into a crystal ball and saw myself alone at my 200-year class reunion

Real lyricism never dies
If you a lyricist you'll be one for eternity
Real lyricists never fall off
They just evolve and get greater
Yeah
We keep hitting you with these twisted graphics

Southeast, Southwest, let's get em, let's get em
3rd Ward, Hiram-Clarke, let's get em, let's get em

Question, how did this develop?
My car, my swagger, my chain, shut the hell up
The one you got ain't even yours
I seen you at the grocery store mopping the floors
You telling lies by the dozen
Boy you ain't no pimp, one of your dancers is your cousin
Said you was balling, but you wasn't
I ain't never seen your wife, you probably got a husband
Your last album was garbage
I listened to it once, it gave my stereo a virus
17 songs, every one wack
I wouldn't sign you to an imaginary contract
Let me quit playing and be for real
You could pay me a mill' like you was giving me a deal
Watch your career plummet
You could win 90 straight and still be 90 under 500

All these toilet paper MCs is killing the game
Sugar water drinking fly cats, killing the game
They wanna knock us out the picture, but we still in the frame
Slap a hater in the grill if you feeling the same

Look at how this fool is dancing, oh Lord
I can't even say this line right, I'm laughing so hard
Your so called hits, you the only one that quote ‘em
You got fan letters, but you the one who wrote ‘em
They say K you should make a dance song, it might bubble
So I made me one up, it's called the Beat-Your-Ass Shuffle
Some of y'all are full of estrogen
Manhood in the negative, y'all are less than men
Octagon match, un-refereed
Bludgeon you, you gon' need somebody to help you bleed
The way you rappers turned the game into a fly fad
It's like some dude blowing up a school and saying my bad
And sagging is so controversial
The hood looking like a damn underwear commercial
And if it ain't one scam, it's another
Now they photoshopping models on their mixtape cover, man

All these toilet paper MCs is killing the game
Sugar water drinking fly cats, killing the game
They wanna knock us out the picture, but we still in the frame
Slap a hater in the grill if you feeling the same

Let me take you back to childhood for one minute, now think
See boys used to wear blue and girls wore pink
Mohawks use to be hard, like Mr. T?, certainly
Now dudes be getting Mohawks and coloring them burgundy
At school you had curls and pretty shirts with swirls
While we was shooting hoops, you played jacks with the girls
Little boys shouldn't put on women’s clothing and you know it
Hey, take this football boy, go outside and throw it
Catch it, run, jump, kick, throw a javelin
Steal a car or start a fight, do something that's masculine
Years later you picked up the mic, uh-oh what's happening?
I won't make no more songs like this, just promise not to rap again
It's impossible to wear pink thuggishly
Don't be surprised if rappers start rocking pumps publically
I'm born with the characteristics of a G
But I can't look at this girl because this dyke is mean mugging me

All these toilet paper MCs is killing the game
Sugar water drinking fly cats, killing the game
They wanna knock us out the picture, but we still in the frame
Slap a hater in the grill if you feeling the same",https://genius.com/K-rino-killin-the-game-lyrics

Merciless verses burn like acid when you battle me
Yeah, Temple of Doom, four thousand levels to consume
K-Rino

Step in the temple of doom, lyrical levitator, ligament lacerator
Legendary line learner, might take your life later
Eulogy creator, massacre maker, voice slayed they health
Opened my book, by the mic, vocals laid they self
I get positioned be ripping ya while you’re wishing
Busting nuts and listen, flow through a collision like an apparition
Commence to ramming your thought pattern and slamming
You’re dooming, you damning you, so let the mortician examine ya
My style is errorless, challenging me is perilous
Street legend evolved into the most scariest therapist
Words physician drama enhance the third power
Radiation is caused by my potent nuclear word shower
You’re staring right into the glaring light
Flammable flows ignite suckers at 300 degrees Fahrenheit
Measure my power might, murder reunite
The manuscript mangler, missile manager, soul subtractor
Tracks I spin 'em, send 'em, sympathize they be in 'em
Anatomy equipped to drink the Five Deadly Venoms
The rest is history, my fist will be swinging
So dope that one rope left twenty violators hanging

Six million ways to die, choose one
If you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun
Six million ways to die, choose one
If you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun

Observe the spoken word, I amaze like science fiction
Whole populations suffer from massive homicide affliction
I burn 'em, hard punch to the sternum ‘cause I'm rattling lungs
Multilingual rapper able to battle in tongues
Prolific paragraph producer, rough rocket scientist
Deep intellectual advanced vocabulary user
Highest level I rose past it
Funeral bringer, family members hearing moans from the closed casket
When its my turn cease the loud joking
My microphone exuding poisonous gas that left the crowd choking
Witnesses fall when I get your verbal, victims outnumber
Doctors' supplies so it’s twenty bodies to a stretcher
Don't need no ganja to conjure, my styles up step
My vocals vertically, then reach 200 miles up
Mathematic melodious mind minutes with a mastery of metaphysics
Musical mirror mad monologues malicious
South Park pioneer getting mine
Went back in time to crack some rappers, I forgot to bust in ‘89
Temple left them in solitary confinement
Emergency surgery whole body realignment

Six million ways to die, choose one
If you can't take the heat get your face from in front of the gun

Help is needed for the conceited, imitators defeated
Lyrics lethally injected, criminals die when they read it
Came out the womb after 12 months due to unfinished business

So ice cold I freeze in the summer, the booming trap creator
Killer cop crucifier deep human calculator meditator
Boy you don't know how slow you rock
Trick I see the future so I might just holler, “Come in!” Right before you knock
Extracurricular beat downs I'm kicking the worst
Non perpendicular visions causing the victim to vomit
Verses poetic, dread it, follow the rapid threat
I'm getting flashbacks of events that haven't happened yet
Criminalistic chronicles I create and criticize
Legitimize battle strategy til he dies
Cast him out, rhymes cut his jugular, slashed him out
Mics bleeding to death, rappers fainting and passing out
Dialects sadistic, terminal vocal teacher so twisted
Birth date unlisted, proving K-Rino never existed
Fool started gunning so I started running
At him, he was busting but I kept on coming
I'm K-Rino, extensions passing with sound
All around, doing pushups without touching the ground
I can breakdown each letter in my name if you want it

Giving Up,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Life is a journey
One filled with great happiness and joyful moments
But sometimes there is sadness and setbacks along the way as well
The key to overcoming the hardships that we face from time to time is very simple
Never give up, never ever, ever give up

Alot of people been lonely, heartbroken and homeless
The ones who fight along the way are the strongest
Got people strung out on every drug you can write down
But no direction or purpose to wrap your life round
Nobody seem to care about the girl that they tricked out
Or somebody that couldn't pay their rent and got kicked out
Your fresh up out the pen, down to change 'cause you want to
But they won't let you in with that felony on you
You tripping, wanting to do it different
Everyday you feel the grip on your patience slipping
On a quest for a chance, you do the best that you can
The depth of your plans makes you feel like less than a man
And you fight through the walls, ask the God to open doors
And you feel like he's answering everyone's prayers but yours
Just know that life can dirty and foul
But the fight ain't over yet so why you throwing in the towel

We all got situations that we go through
Your pain is a part of life, that statement's so true
But giving up on God is something you should never do
'cause no matter what he'll never give up on you
It can't be no giving up, giving up
Won't be no giving up

You tried to make your marriage work out
You did everything but still it took the worst route
With nobody there to pick you up when you fall
And one bad person made you lose faith in them all
Despite all the pain, yourself you must not blame
Though every single grain of your trust got drained
The longer the same song plays the song worsens
Did everything right but did it for the wrong person
Them lonely days can make a cold night colder
Now you gotta uproot and start your whole life over
It's bad that they left but what's harder than them leaving
Is that they broke it off and they never gave a clear reason
So now you in limbo  from back then
Depressed and love sick and ready to cash in
Still under the spell and the illusion that you need 'em
Now recognise that you just got blessed with your freedom

We all got situations that we go through
Your pain is a part of life, that statement's so true
But giving up on God is something you should never do
'cause no matter what he'll never give up on you
It can't be no giving up, giving up
Won't be no giving up

The reason why power isn't established
We don't invest in our future, we invest in our habits
We point fingers and stop fighting before the game's done
When you started blaming people you forgot the main one
Pray that the Most High erased the hurt
Don't wait for work, the boss creates the work
And that will free you, you are an original, not a sequel
Before birth you've already lived in two people
The vessels are which humans are distributed through
Energised and guided by the god living in you
To lay down and just quit we ain't taught like that
What if every great woman and man thought like that
They would never leave their dreams in the dark like that
When the opposition thought them they thought right back
When you're tired keep mashing to finish your task
You don't abandon the car just 'cause it ran out of gas

We all got situations that we go through
Your pain is a part of life, that statement's so true
But giving up on God is something you should never do
'cause no matter what he'll never give up on you
It can't be no giving up, giving up
Won't be no giving up",https://genius.com/K-rino-giving-up-lyrics
The Epitome,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"I arose from the ashes of my mic-foes
I floated up and glowed while clothed in jalabiya tight white robe
From across the globe I cited microbes
Waited for night time to expose, kidnapped the darkness and hid it inside a light bulb
Y'all know I write poltergeist flows
You showed up at the open mic, I exploded and left the mic closed
When I fight I throw nitroglycerin right blows
That strike cranial lobes leaving crater-like holes
See K-Rino's a music gymnast
I got so many unusual hidden clues in one sentence it'll confuse a chemist
I'll never lose a scrimmage
I got tools that'll nuke you in minutes and move you from finite to a translucent image
I'm pinning four lines at a time I'm complex with this
I got two extra hands, I'm double ambidextrous
The language specialist who wrecks beyond your Exodus
And ejects the best deadly messages, minus the expletives

Now when it comes to being an emcee I'm the epitome
It's gonna take a army of lyricists to get rid of me
When you think of the weak, never consider me
I'm stronger than the purist cocaine, come take a hit of me

The sun shined on my lines and they grew vines
I'll write a new rhyme more amazing then running the 100-dash in 2-9
When the melee ignites, I'll be writing it
The wind in my lung is strong enough to fly a 7 ton kite in it
While you was in the streets, looking feeble
I was in the rap cathedral, sleeping on the bed of 7 million needles
My reproductive seed is so outstanding and great
I could repopulate a planet with a manikin mate
I'll have a genius moving wrap speed, stranded and late
My thoughts took off at 9 O'clock but landed at 8
Got ready heat, I'll read from a dreaded sheet
Then let it seep deep in ya head and feet unsheathed and cleave you into shredded wheat
See my lines got enough homicide enzymes to actually re-enact columbine 9 or 10 times
My photographic brains terrific aim can snap shot the cosmic plane and show every lane the 8X10 picture frame

Now when it comes to being an emcee I'm the epitome
It's gonna take a army of lyricists to get rid of me
When you think of the weak, never consider me
I'm stronger than the purist cocaine, come take a hit of me

The fact you think that you can end me is what offends me
We can go back into time and I'll rip you up last Wednesday
I test forensics under lab lenses
My lyric infringes up on your senses, winces through you till it cleanses
See your creative efforts are minimal
I'm the information general who rips flows in thousand minute intervals
I disassemble lyrical imbeciles
Ventricles limbs in intricate chemicals I mix and reinvent them identical (woo)
My skin is full of sun ray minerals, so my mental is plentiful
My torso extends 10 venomous tentacles
Your intellectual pinnacle is embroil
You can be the only individual left in the battle and it's not winnable
I've never been the type to wear blazers
I'm the type to engrave phrases inside of your palms with hot razors
A sick brain my page vaccinates it, still it murders the patient
Because it straight contaminates his blood platelets",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-epitome-lyrics
Soul Merchants,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"For what is a man profited
If he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?

Yeah, we used to wake up fiending
To write words in between the paper's lines that had meaning
Seeking hood recognition fighting for precision
Being strengthened by the competition
But once the game started growing
Struggles came without us knowing and the pain started showing
We took pride in intellect and skill
Now you gotta have some sex appeal to get a record deal
And if you did come correct, they soon made you change your tune
Once they called you in that special room
They pimping you but you too weak to fight
Without your manhood I don't see how you can sleep at night
We the ones they tried to ruin, when we started spewing
Facts on what the government was doing
Somebody needs to break the street
Cause Master got these fake gangsters sitting down to take a leak

Haha, you got a nice new pretty car
A chain and a female that you purchased at the titty bar
Five million in your bank account
But a bunch of friends and family that you never think about
Just analyze how you looking dude
Don't even wanna feed the same folks who helped you cook the food
You chose money over pride, denied everybody
Locked in the eternal courtship with the Illuminati
Then you blowed up over night
Did what you was told to do and wrote what you was told to write
But K-Rino is broke form the mould of dolomite
With no letting go of my creative control in sight
Shoutout to Savage Mike and Paragon
I won't stop until the the whole world done heard Farrakhan
I keep my soul like Sarah Vaughan
We got long wind, you're like a fool with one lung in a marathon

Haha, you started climbing up the public ladder
Weeks after the Devil made you switch and change your subject matter
And if you buck they go the extra mile to swallow you
And start piling tons of propaganda just to silence you
Most people would say, ""Hell no!""
When you ask them have they ever heard of 
COINTELPRO
?
They out to murder any black who's formidable
You know why King was really killed? He started getting political
See, they don't mind you being famous
Until you start speaking God's language, then you're dangerous
And now he must be eliminated
After threats, 99% become intimidated
You turned your back on those who bled with ya
They out the picture now that Satan's in the bed with ya
We should catch you and cut your thumbs off
For selling out the hood when they threaten to cut your funds off",https://genius.com/K-rino-soul-merchants-lyrics
Who Is This,Alien Baby,2011.0,"Man who is this calling me?
Aw man!

Hello? (Is this K?) Yeah who is this?
(We ain't never meet before playboy my name is Chris
I don't know what's going on but I figured I'd take the risk
I got your number from Sinthia's phone contact list)
Homeboy is you serious? Why you calling me then?
This sounds like a conversation you and her need to be in
See insecure dudes like you let women drive 'em
(If I find out where you at I promise this goin be a problem)
Oh man, is this the part where I'm supposed to panic?
You talking to a grown man, boy skip the semantics
(What?) Never mind let's talk and get it clear
(Ain't nothing to talk about we've been engaged for a year)
Well if that's the case I suggest that y'all should get therapy
Secondly lower your voice cause all that loudness ain't scaring me
And alothugh you wasn't aware of me
If my name and number's in her phone apparently it was saved there voluntarily
Get it out your system

(I kinda see your point but man you don't know what I go through
Why you pushing up on my girl?) Dude, I don't even know you
But like a fool I'm sitting on this phone doing an interview
So I'm a take it striaght since I known her she never mentioned you
(You lying) So tell me who got it twisted
Before this phone call I never knew that you existed
I know your heart's broke but checking me was too raw
Don't charge me up about I'm just as suprised as you are
And man I ain't comfortable with this conversation
Because I know what it's coming to is a confrontation
We all been in love so I feel your passion bruh
But see you asking me questions you should be asking her
She your woman not mine, that's if you choose to go back
(How many times did y'all?) Bruh, you don't wanna know that
I'm try'na be diplomatic and spare you from the torture kid
Because it's evident that you don't know her like ya thought you did
(I gave her everything, promised I would carry her)
Well all I guess that I can say to you is don't marry her
Or maybe you should look at yourself instead of flip out
And figure out what you did wrong to make her dip out
Get it out your system

You need to man up and try to get over this (I'm trying)
See once you... hold up, timeout, are you crying?
Is it that for real? (I'll do anything to get her back)
Wow, but it's two forty-three in the morning where is she at now?
(I figured she was staying with you)
Nah, she ain't over here (how do I know what'chu saying is true?)
Well number one you should've of played it by that old school rule
Always check the woman fool never check the dude
What'cha doing now is dangerous, it's a shame that I'm explaining this
I can't beleive I'm even entertaining this
Your action prove who's the man
When she makes it home square it off with her let her know but just don't use your hand
In life you gotta understand things (What?)
One man's woman is another man's fling
And in closing, I hope that you handle this like a grown up
Cause I got better things to do so umma hang this phone up
Get it out your system",https://genius.com/K-rino-who-is-this-lyrics
Stories From The Black Book,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Life's a Wheel of Fortune, come spin it
Kill a man in South Park, he'll be back in about twenty minutes
In my hood, kids don't know how to act
Cause the Tooth Fairy is hoing and Santa Claus is selling crack
At night, a bullet overexertor
Creates a new game in the Park, Name That Murder
Little Johnny is hard I assume
I heard he had a twin but killed his ass in the womb
Real life is wrecking your brain Jack
You might as well take a fucking nap on a train track
Murder a dope fiend, prostitute, thief, cop or crook
I'm kicking Stories from the Black Book

K-Rino, K-Rino
Showing motherfuckers how South Park go

Boys and girls, it's time to get deep
I'm finna telling y'all the story of Little Ho Peep
Damn that booty was cheap as can be
And if she brought her friend you could buy one fuck one free
A brother hit it then broke from the scene
Came to find out that the little trick was fourteen
She didn't pimp so he thought that he lucked up
He came in the freak, now she pregnant (man, that's fucked up)
What's even worse, she would hit the smoke and pistol on occasion
Never fazed when people started gazing
Raised in the neighborhood of ducks
I'm handing out bucks to a bum and some wranglers and dirty ass chucks
Kids who ought to be future lawyers, stock brokers
Turn out to be hoes, future warriors and rock smokers
Burnt out, broke and hooked

Yo, a brother thought he was hard and slick
Tried to pull a trick and got shot down quick
Just like Theresa, her record was very clean
Till five cops fucked her on the side of that Dairy Queen
Game is game yet death is reality
Money's a necessity yet school's a technicality
Cereal with no milk's what it's like
Cause Snap is snorting, Crackle's on crack and Pop's hitting the pipe
It's up to us to teach ourself, then teach brothers
Mentally mold, educate, then reach others
Before I go out like a trick from the past
I'll wipe my ass with sandpaper and broken glass
If negativity continues to reign
Ya might as well stand in line and get fitted for ya chain
Twist your brain and change ya name
Cause in the drawers of life, you ain't nothing but a shit stain
Cause brothers will strip you naked
Grab your neck and break it, steal a ambulance so you won't make it
And I don't wanna see your nuts getting took
And become another chapter of K-Rino's Black Book

Brain Reaction,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"Brain reaction
Let's go

There’s no character of my caliber
Battle you while my left hand slapping ya
While my right hand’s practising playing Galaga
I re-channel my stamina
I’m plannin' on not using my hands this time
And managing to toss you off a banister
My work is pristine, the phenomenal earthling
Special powers, 85 story towers I’m hurtling
K-Rino the undisputed verbal king
I’m so mean I bumped you off and still make you clean your own murder scene
I don’t wear pickett socks, nor do I drink CÎROC
I’d rather creep the block or frequent spots where I can seek knowledge and think a lot
My quest for greatness never seems to stop
So I sit in your relinquished spot leaking out enough product to sink a yacht
If you were smart you’d forfeit before I drop you to the floor quick
With bars sharp as the front part of a swordfish
Underground or corporate, like Thor I knock you into orbit
My heart is black as the plaque in La Brea Tar Pits

Let's relax a minute
Breathe for a second
Let's go

Sent me back I doubt that
How can you out rap a genius who can catch a wild hyena in a mousetrap
They look at me and say, ""That man mind gone""
Crazy like tryna take a selfie with a landline phone
One minute I'm laughin', rapping on happy subjects
Next minute I'm snapping on your ass in public, flipping out like Gary Douglas
I'm not concerned with the facts you're learning
Face you while my back is turning, K can rap longer than black pastor sermon
No one can last when a blast occurs
Once a year I have the urge to travel the Earth and do a trash rapper purge
If I'm not vibing with you, I'ma get you
Reach into the frame and smacking people every time they walk by my picture
Splitting your head if you don't listen to what's said
I stand over your bed and drop a transmission on your leg
Am I passive? No! K-Rino goes where the assassins go
And if I'm the first to blast at your carriage you'll be the last to know
They still anticipating for the fat lady to sing for K
But they was taking so long she lost weight, got fine, and now we datin'
My grand expanding academics passes every mans limits
You can't win and fire screams when I put my hand in it
And I can't wait to take my turn at ya, right now I'm learning ya
Be miles away from home and rearrange my furniture
I sleep walk in my fortress and I'ma keep talking regardless
I step out at night and leave teeth marks in the darkness

Alright, you almost there
Let's go

My test, that'll be magic if he passes
I'll toast the masses with battery acid in our glasses
And I would hope to smoke the lie you spoke when I tied the rope
And somehow I still be sound asleep when I'm wide awoke
The clouds follow me, with undoubted power they shower me
I crush and squeeze you hourly 'till your body is powdery
I'm air tight and you don't have your facts quite right
I'm passed nice, I can make the same match strike twice
I might brake into a sprint and pass by ya
So fast that the wind speed will leave you stomach lookin' like a slashed tire
The news spread like a grass fire
I'm the last guy you wanna try
Your corpse will be sung over by a mass choir
Dialysis on a vampire
I can write inside a cramped dryer
Tumbling as the temperature expands higher
Y'all sweet as high fructose
I boast my vocab can confuse most
Like trying to spell the last name of Duke's coach
I overkill you with both fists
Make you overdose then empty four clips
And then choke you after your throat slit
Then poach all y'all 
You're still not safe after your spirit floats
'Cause I'll invoke a dead mobster to do a ghost hit",https://genius.com/K-rino-brain-reaction-lyrics
Four Minute Warning,Time Traveler,2006.0,"Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Just when they thought it couldn't get no colder, I had to raise my level 18 more notches. Yeah. Come on

My momma had an abortion years before I spit a rhyme out
They threw me in the trash but two hours later I climbed out
With blood and afterbirth, I started on a blind route
Civilians threatened by the sight of a newborn infant with a lion's mouth
I copulate and repopulate, at age four
I started removing my own organs just to see how they operate
I could make the apocalypse end with a preposterous spin
I'm a alien python that sheds rhinoceros skin
You choke and gag when words are spoken fast
I smoke and blast paragraphs  at a cat swallowing broken glass
I provide infinite homicide by making you die
The death of every human in history that ever died
I worshipped on the Sabbath, then put bodies in cabinets
Spared the sinners and killed the saints cause they was arrogant
When the priest sees the millimeter of three threes
I'm a self-producing species, your brain holds less intelligence than my feces
My dominance was ominent from it comes prominent confidence
I pack a 'matic that I use to crack continents
I wet a rain, spark burst from the brain
I spit propane and make fire burst up into more flames
I shatter bladders and scatter matter, send data at a
Character actor rapper 'til cadavers splatter with marinara
I grab and pull your clavicle
To see if its extractable, I'm an actual mathematical quadrilateral
Your throat, I'll make blood flow from it, I'll impregnate your woman
And nine months later snatch the fetus up out of your stomach
A spacecraft landed with a hyperbolic bed on it
People collapsed cause every alien that exited had my head on it
My homicides are shown in a hearse, chronologically reversed
So the last victim I murdered actually died first
Whatever your effort is, I'll effortlessly better ya
I could sever both of my feet and still be two steps ahead of ya
I'm the thought editor, like a head of lettuce I shredded ya
I could sit on a planet nebula with a weapon and red sweater ya
I plot debauchery while you ride where my crotch be
I ought to wrap your whole body around my wrist, the way you watch me
'Til time ends, I'ma be a threat
I got another head up on my neck, but human eyes can't see it yet
I carry ten times my weight like a ant do
I'm dyslexic, but me with still me with hang can't you
I mean you can't hang with me, the imperial skill spiller
Optical illusional mirror serial killer
I'll stand you at a intersection and rip
Until I make your body take off running in 17 different directions
Like a surgeon, I open your chest and put my words in
I'm the first one to bust like a dude that nutted up in a virgin
And you picking up the microphone and beating me rapping
Is kind of like constipation, it's some shit that won't happen
You disillusioned, boy. I sink you quick
You got lyrical hypochondria, you just think you sick
And it's hazardous for a stalky MC to try me
Like a hospital patient with hydrochloric acid in his IV
A bomb was ticking in my right arm
I'm the lovechild of a night storm and an unborn futuristic alien lifeform
I prozac slackers with no trap, other planets I go jack
And return with a sack of extraterrestrial throwbacks
I'll approach you with aggression and slap you so hard
I'll be able to look inside my hand and see your facial expression
My telekinetics will stand on ya
I'll put you in a sleeper hold without even laying a hand on ya
Leave contestants with infections in they midsections
I'm harder than a roll of quarters and a tyrannosaurus erection
Send me a hundred years back and make me transparent
And you will never be born cause I'll murder both sets of your grandparents
A mic's what I have, no gun to run grab
Slap you with five combinations in the time it took you to throw one jab
Like I said before, I'm really from a future time
And the only reason I'm here right now is to execute your rhyme
The seat I blast you off with word plex, I had to spark it
Fly around the city on my Black Book like a magic carpet
Your syllable was too easily killable
I'm a musical miracle with a brain that's refillable
From the womb, I was consumed with ominous doom
My thoughts traveled and exhumed Nostradamus' tomb
I'm from a wicked platoon where false promises bloom
A mansion with twenty rooms and a caterpillar's cocoon
Yeah what's up, Kuwait?

Legendary pioneer, the grand wizard K-Rino. This nigga started this shit, nigga. The reason why you the author of the shit you spit: God, nigga. The beginning and the ending. It began with this nigga, and it's gon' end with this nigga. You niggas can't fuck with Rino, nigga. What, you MHMR or something, motherfucker? Stop selling your medicine, and use it, idiot.

Where the righteous mind state elevates to eternal life
Message to the black man, Federal Express
Plus I’m Bruce Lee, thoughts to the chest
, may he rest
In a box made of pine ‘cause he ate the swine
Time to design a new rhyme, count the massacres in every line
Damage to equipment, vocal onslaught
Two or three microphones testified in the court
That I broke ‘em when I choked them and left them in the base
Same cases, all the ignorant individuals that I face
Over the years with my Black Book, dropping a radical quote
Rhymes equivalent to a Tyson punch with brass knuckles to your throat
When I state, “God made me great,” I slash and then I wait
To crush the type of men I hate, they choke then hyperventilate
We playing a game but ain’t no rest from blocking your right using your left
By dissing the master you’re choosing your death
I’m sort of like this ‘cause I’m losing my breath, what?
I get it right back and give a brain scan
I’m a planet, you just a piece of a grain of sand
Who can compare with me when the overdose is done?
I saw one a million years back, but he the closest one
No pork, no beef, let me make that clear
I don’t smoke the weed or drink the beer

Higher Life Form,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Of all writers and emcees I come through most
No pliers I use my mind to unscrew bolts
I’m probably sick it would be insane to try me
A brainstorm is weak, I get brain tsunamis
Ancient stones I wrote on, alternate world flow zone
Known to relieve pain like lyrical oxycodone
Make the craziest moves, I don’t play by rules
Everyday I have twenty-two déjà vu's
Why would you want to start a war for?
Every line feels like your lip is being slammed in a car door
I won’t tell you everything that I will do
But I feel like taking you apart to see if I’m able to rebuild you
They all artificial plus they liars
I’m unstoppable like a vehicle with cut break wires
Quickly roll upon your soldiers and took over
Show up in your cul-de-sac to roast ya 'til you're bust like a shook soda

As soon as you turn the mic on
I become a higher life form
Right from the morning 'til the night's gone
Staying warm naked in a ice storm

Soon as you turn the mic on
I become a higher life form
Right from the morning 'til the night's gone
Staying warm naked in a ice storm
Conceptual lights born
K-rino, the higher life form

My presence is unquestionable
I see the regret in your retinal section as the essence of life exits you
The respiratory pressures unmeasurable
'cause no oxygen is left within your chest, vitals signals are undetectable
Power moves are insurmountable because people from all around they use my music for fuel, hold me accountable
Some time is taken understandably, every creator strand carefully written by hand planted organically
So when my grand ideas land, they transfer and expand demand, activating pineal glands
With waves that could even cut blades
What I just laid can actually be traded for custom-made upgrades
Head strikes spin you around the force pounds you so hard the waves on your hair will be on the ground
Ageless since the day I was made
So many concepts rain down, I place wiper blades on the page

Soon as you turn the mic on
I become a higher life form
Right from the morning 'til the night's gone
Staying warm naked in a ice storm
Conceptual lights born
K-rino, the higher life form
Soon as you turn the mic on
I become a higher life form
Right from the morning 'til the night's gone
Staying warm naked in a ice storm
Conceptual lights born
K-rino, the higher life form

Verbal crack my services gave birth to that
Short circuit the satellites, they won't know where the Earth is at
I’m the first to practice reversible inertia acts
Disperse a few facts then I'll revert the inertia back
Undefeatable evil and disagreeable fleeing the homicide in an unseeable vehicle
People who read a few of my pieces leave with unspeakable lethal diseases prestigious healers label untreatable
I can defeat a crew if it’s me against twenty-three of you and sneak a secret brew in the feeding tube that your eating though
I’m exceeding beyond regional 'cause even geeks who use telescopes look at me when they need a deeper view
Level you on your best day, they could never impress K
Smother you when you press play, every line is a essay
K is the wrong composer to call out alone
Swipe my picture to the right and I might fall out your phone

The God Within,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008.0,"What's up?
We are victims of a lie a righteous plan gone aride
And some said we are all God's children the most high
God is who created us and we agree that's true
If we're in His image and His likeness, then what would that make you?
From the young to the old all the gifts that we hold
Are parts of Himself deposited in every living soul
Is therefore to trap loss focus the century's allapse
With an essence of the creator within was untapped
Stolen from you and me when they drove us across the sea
And our true knowledge of self is buried under the depree
Of deception and false hood being bread mentally dead
The fulfillment of the spiritual Hiram hitting the ahead
They generated and robbed of our inner power to think
To the lineage of the God we're biologically linked
From the flesh to the arteries, you a part of me G
You're a mirror, so when I look at you I oughta see me

We scar, we sin, that's why it's so hard to win
Don't ever give up try channel the God within
When you let the light in, you revolve and spin
Become closer to Him then you are with men

You can't ride by yourself; Allah's the best guide
How can you be right when you operating from ya left side?
The left side makes you confide in hatred and lies
Envy and pride, a murderer with lust in his eyes
So even when we try to get real we end up yielding
And churches, mosques and synagogues are nothing but buildings
You are the true house of God let it be known
So do you think He wants to live inside an unclean home?
Heaven or hell only one can dwell your actions of proof
You can't make God and Satan live under the same roof
He presents you, would essence you, limitless potential
In a credential to send material inventions from your mental
Use the wrong tools it's written you shall lose
The devil seeks to confuse and decrease your values
And no self-esteem proved it was you who denied you
Cause what helped your brother win you got the same inside you

We scar, we sin, that's why it's so hard to win
Don't ever give up try channel the God within
When you let the light in, you revolve and spin
Become closer to Him then you are with men

Ain't no such thing as miracles there's a reason to every action
A natural formula behind every act that happens
Science and mathematics you can't manage the fathoms
So you pass em off as mysteries cause you can't mentally grasp them
Instead of bringing people down try to uplift
You live to die without ever manifesting your gift
Who brought order to chaos and orchestrated a pattern?
The Creator, who first originated from the atom
Not the A.D.A.M. but the A.T.O.M
Money ain't power; power's when you get to know Him
And when you get to know Him, you'll get to know you
And watch the infinite inner power He'll show you

Don't ever give up try channel the God within

The pain we all share
Think about your momma
Think about your daddy
Think about your homeboy
Think about your cousin
Think about your brother
Think about your sister

Even though you rest in peacefully, grieving's never easy
While living life freely I'd never thought you'd leave me
Life lessons you would teach me and constantly receive me
Even times when you didn't agree with me completely
I can't believe this happening, I miss hearing you laughing
The gladness that we had turns to sadness when that path ends
Reality, truth hurts, the suffering grew worse
Wondering what God was telling me by taking you first
Maybe I'll just call this lost part of this harvest
And no you wasn't flawless but I loved you regardless
So even though it pains me and things are not the same we
Have to accept the change and let the will of God reign free
Paid all your dues right, now you on a new flight
Released from the painful imprisonment of this cruel life
And though your gone physically, mentally you visit me
Infinitely in my memory for all you did for me

You'll always remain (where?) in my heart
(Never gon forget about ya, we ain't never gon forget about ya)
You'll always remain (remain where?) in my heart
(We ain't Never gon forget about ya)
(We ain't never gon forget)

God's glorification is women and man's mission
From the minute of your birth, your beginning, your transition
The spirit and flesh are separate, severance is definite
Whenever it ends, we're thankful for what you left us with
Not material or money, all that festers fast
And to have you back I'd trade it all no questions asked
If I had one hour with you, that might ease the circumstance
I could speak the words I should of said but never got the chance
But as I think about it I focused and saw the light
The chance for me to show you what you meant was right there all my life
Concentrating on the flesh is never wise to do
The legacy you leave is what immortalizes you
All the wisdom you was dropping then, I clearly see
Was making it that when you pass away you'll live in me
Now everyday I see just like you I pray to be
And maybe even give someone the happiness you gave to me


They say that pictures can't talk but yet they find the means
Cause when you look at 'em, they place you in a time machine
Next thing you know your laughing, mind state in a better place
Remembering a past moment like it was yesterday
Keep their memory alive and never let it fade
Tell your children 'bout the impact that their presence made
And even though the tears flow you gotta still rejoice
At least two or three times a day I can hear your voice
When they said that all ends with time they wasn't lying
My grandparents, Jerry, A.C. and my cousin Bryan
God is in control, know he got our best in mind
If only life was like a movie, you could press rewind
The loss of a loved one can totally engross ya
It can split a family up or it can bring them closer
Just keep in mind, the Sun shines once the night is gone

I'm the phenom who was born with 3 arms but one is hidden until the beef comes
Then I'm a human adapter with 3 prongs
And each palm releases out a bee swarm
That keeps on reforming itself and one sting lasts for a week long
My entourage stretches 100 yards, they guard me as I conjure bars
That hit harder than hummer sized bumper cars
I trapped the Sun and stars under one garage, like Mumm-Ra
I come for war with a sharp ton of harp carving your lungs apart
I'm heartless like embalmed corpses
My rawness hits like the force of jaw kicks from fourteen horses
When a fraud inserts my audio cartridge
My voice gets harsh and starts to discharge a rockets catharsis
To ask me for a pass would be your last resort
Sometimes I'm so relaxed in thought I recline in a chair that has no back support
No men are left when the heat that's in my realm is felt
I come swinging a belt, I've got a camera that can film itself

Move 'em around like chess pieces
The mad lyrical professor with the best thesis
Alpha omega, angelic writer with blessed deepness
Any challenger north, south, east or west ceases to exist

The people fiend in lobby to be seen beside me
5 preachers arrived and had to exorcise me out the demons body
Swinging wildly like I'm John ""The Beast"" Mugabi
Unconsciously scuba diving blindly while violently juggling 3 tsunamis
I got some magic I can't wait to do
If I'm out of town and you need me to come straight to you, I'll pop in like the Great Gazoo
Astro physiological fast flow
My senses are so sharp and rare that I can hear my own hair grow
I'm the step courier of raw fresh flurries
My verbiage is so turbulent and unearthly I heard it makes stress worry
And the best hurry to see if their weak intellect serves me
As I have church insurgically wrecked for the best clergy
You thirsty dudes need to rehearse your moves
I bruise some of you worthless fools
While using my first verses from nursery school
I don't see light bulbs when the concept is bred
When I get an idea, the Sun appears up over my head

Move 'em around like chess pieces
The mad lyrical professor with the best thesis
Alpha omega angelic writer with blessed deepness
Any challenger north south east or west ceases to exist

I turn federal agents into medical patients
High stratispherical spaces my pedestal placement
The flame kindler monument trembler
The intricate detail rememberer the shattered mirror reassembler
Shorten my paper is a dangerous game
I'll slang them things with an insane deranged orangutan if he don't bring my change
And when you try to be a hero
My speech flows and repose weak souls and seep slow through your keyhole
Understand that he was loaded with vanity
So I chased him on open land and ran him immediately out of humanity
My voice though unseen is so gorgeous
That the highest skill sources take losses like rich men in divorces
And every phrase I ever made is so crazy in every way
That the cerebral waves can levitate a Chevrolet
And it ain't smart to chance that
'cause what I send back at you is harder than the man that Medusa glanced at

Move em around like chess pieces

Any challenger north south east or west ceases to exist",https://genius.com/K-rino-chess-pieces-lyrics
Man in the Mask,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"Come walk with me
You might not like where I take you though
Yeah get ready, enter my mind

Yesterday morning I stood in the mirror, gazing into my own eyes
Knowing the life that I was living wasn't the one that I visualized
Half woke and half unconscious, I replayed my life over
Saw the image of a man with a mask standing over my shoulder
First I thought that I was hallucinating, I must be still sleep
Dreaming deep, I paid it no mind until I heard him speak
And the words he spoke were deadly, no love in them were meant
Said he was watching me and I would see him everywhere that I went
I got scared and broke the mirror, ran out feeling a buzz
Determined not to quit but once I looked up there he was
I was hoping I could take the mask up off his face and see
I had two questions, who is this man? And why is he chasing me?
I jumped in the ride and burnt off, doing my best to run
Passed at least 11 bus-stops and he was standing at every one
Saw him in my rear-view mirror, thought my sanity's tryna pimp me
'Cause there wasn't no cars behind me and my backseat was empty
I looked at the clock and I noticed, it's 2:23pm
But I'm paranoid 'cause nobody was outside but me and him
I couldn't shake, escape or evade him no matter what corners I was cutting
Had a full tank of gas, but the car shut down all of a sudden
I bailed out and started running, I'm in my hood and I know it well
But the street signs had changed up, they had words on them like 'Hell'
And had words on them like 'murder', 'damnation' and 'lies' instead
And whatever street that I ran down, I went through what it said
I was in pain so I broke down, it all ended at last
The torture felt like 20 hours but only 5 minutes had passed
Why was I going through this suffering? What was this man scheming?
Before he took me I woke up screaming and realized that I was dreaming
I was glad that it was over, so I stood up to my feet
Walked outside to get some fresh air and absorb some of the heat
I kind of laughed about the whole thing once the drama was complete
I almost passed out when I looked up and seen him standing across the street
I took off was running full speed, as fast as I could go
But no matter how fast I ran, he was right behind my walking slow
With the same mask on from the dream with specks of blood on it
Tired of running for my life, he'd have to take mine if he want it
So I stop to turn and face him, no words were left to say
But once he saw my fear was gone, he took off running the other way
I was confused while I was chasing him, it wasn't what it seems
How can I fight something that hides in mirror reflections and in dreams?
Nevertheless, I got to take the chance and hope that I can stretch him
At that moment he stopped running as if he wanted me to catch him
All the psychological anguish that I went through was defined
I grabbed his head, snatched his mask off and the face in it was mine
I almost went blind, but it all came together step by step
I was being chased by my own sin, running from the dark side of myself
As I choked him in a tight grasp, I began to understand
Right then and there the man in the mask just disappeared inside my hand
It was all a sign for me to change and see the world clearer
I closed my eyes and when I opened 'em I was back in front of the mirror
But even though the man was gone, I still can't say that it's the end
'Cause I know that if I slip up, I'll see that mask again",https://genius.com/K-rino-man-in-the-mask-lyrics
I Gotta Go,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"Sometimes you gotta be real with things, man
Can't force it
Yeah

I'ma tell you all there is to know (yeah)
We tryna keep somethin' that should've ended years ago
Back in the gap, it just made me happy when you smile
But truth is we ain't been like that in awhile
And people think we all good, but see there's been a trial
Now it's like we both walkin' 'round here in denial
We set this tone an it's obvious we did it wrong
'Cause in the bedroom, it's the only time we get along
I'm 'bout to break free so I got to tell you how real it be
'Cause feelin' each other physically ain't sh' without mental compatibility
The point is reached where you just rather would roam the streets
It's deep when a man can't be inside his home in peace
All that fussin' an accusing and not trustin' you and cussin' you
That ain't somethin' that I'm accustom to
When you away that's the only time the house is quiet
Cameo, single life, I think I'm about to try it

I really hate to leave but I gotta go (I gotta go)
Ya boy ain't happy as you probably know (yeah)
We been up in this cycle for along time (for a ling time)
But I'm about to get gone now
And I ain't about to let you run me through the ground (can't do it)
I think it's time for me to move around (should've knew it)
I really hate to leave but I gotta go (gotta go)
Yeah, come on

It's not smart to stay with someone just 'cause y'all familiar
Still trippin' everyday, homie, that stress will kill ya
Nothin' wrong with lettin' trial an error help us learn
Goin' our separate ways might put us on better terms
Wasted years all for nothing 'cause we kept pretendin'
But time will kill the bitterness if we accept the endin'
It's like the harder that I try to swim the more I drown
It's like the more I try to build, the more you tore it down
I can't forget how you was actin' back then
Gettin' relationship advice from your ratchet ass friends
Don't know nothing 'bout men, but runnin' they mouth more
Can't none of them keep a dude, but they tellin' you how to handle yours
Right now I know it ain't no hope for us
When I talk to you it's drama then you wonder why I never open up
You don't seem to know you role and that's our trouble
If I'm the king, why I got to have a power struggle?

I really hate to leave but I gotta go (I gotta go)
Ya boy ain't happy as you probably know (yeah)
We been up in this cycle for along time (for a ling time)
But I'm about to get gone now (now)
And I ain't about to let you run me through the ground (can't do it)
I think it's time for me to move around (should've knew it)
I really hate to leave but I gotta go (gotta go)
Yeah, come on

Both sides gotta choose wisely
It's a whole lot more to it then what your eyes see
How much longer could a man think it's gonna last
When you overlook the mind an only focus on the ass
No peace, no time, all I get is noise (yeah)
You get mad when you hear me laughin' with my boys
No more date nights or goin' out to eat
I'm at the movies, in the restaurant one deep
We like a broke down ride wit' a lot of millage
Ain't nobody drivin', we just movin' on autopilot
Can we have one day where we don't even fuss (one day)
Babies askin' why come daddy always leavin' us
We make each other frustrated as we ever get
Both upset wishin' that we never met
For the sake of both of us I gotta break away
'Cause this relationship is at its expiration date

I really hate to leave but I gotta go (I gotta go)
Ya boy ain't happy as you probably know (yeah)
We been up in this cycle for along time (for a ling time)
But I'm about to get gone now (now)

Two Pages,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Then it was said that a stranger would come and deliver words and dimensions unattainable by the human mind
And indoctrinate futuristic flow patterns that would transcend time
Now the hours upon us, the light is blinding to average sight
Thousands came from miles around just to sit and watch the young man write
To sit and watch the young man write

Phenomenal new phrases that take you through stages
Watch me massacred a million MCs with two pages
Open my book and quantum leap through the ages
Watch me massacred a million MCs with two pages

They say the shortest distance between 2 points is a straight line
The longest journey between two minds is one of my rhymes
I expound Solomon's wisdom, chronic or biblical
My words travel mathematic paths through land masses just to get to you
My cardiac holds what average men lack
They found a modem in my chest once they peeled my skin back
My brain stem is equivalent to a hand grenade's pin
I toss thoughts in the wind, they hit crowds and explode inside men
I change prophecy, fast forward and intercepted hate
Navigated fate and kept it straight while in an narcoleptic state
Organs I liquidate, maniacal threats I matriculate
Words spoke at a backwards rate make spirits evacuate
I got killers aboard, come down on your syllable hard
I'm conceived from thought, was born with no umbilical cord
I exhaust myself, when I compose I haemorrhage and suffer
I write a paragraph and it takes me seven months to recover
I cause memory lapse to win before my enemy does
You don't exist, so I just make you forget who you never was
I dig cavities and savagely laugh at the war casualties
I spit fire by gargling acid from car batteries
I'm the enemy of anemone
I simultaneously stand at the beginning of time and at the end of infinity
Reveal lyrics that reduce your future descendants to remnants
I master calculus and dream interpretation as an infant
I'm mathematics, I multiply and divide myself
I am the Universe so I guess that I live inside myself
I spark a lecture, build word temples with lyrical architecture
My talk affects ya, I'll send venomous land sharks to get ya
The conception of my concept was immaculate
I'll skilfully implant myself inside of an atom without cracking it
I perfected prophetic rhetoric
I kill teams and release steam at a steal beam, my lowest decibel severed it
I ain't gotta tap your phone once the conspiracy starts
I'll sneak a bug inside your brain and listen in on your thoughts
All my foes stated that verbally K was the most hated
I'll drop a speck of dust from an aircraft, jump out and locate it
Place the torsos of my foes inside silicone moulds
Miraculously telepathically snap telephone polls
Paranormal elements, K-Rino's releasing them
Concentration levels increase 'til I'm communicating with paramecium
My pace is torrid, the Moon could hit me and I'll absorb it
I could whisper and knock the Earth out its whole ecliptic orbit
I do things in microseconds that takes weeks to do
See I'm the entity that speaks to your conscious before it speaks to you
I stand at a distance and deliver wisdom
I threw my voice in five directions, multi-ventriloquism
I damage the inanimate with scandalous cinematic grammar that banishes planets
See your army and single-handedly handle it
Doctors try to decipher my phrases for medication
But the language that I speak is thermonuclear radiation
They call me flat line ‘cause the tone of my voice never decease
My weakest thought weighs eleven tons at the least

Watch me massacred a million MCs with two pages
Open my book and quantum leap through the ages
Watch me massacred a million MCs with two pages",https://genius.com/K-rino-two-pages-lyrics
So Grateful,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"I’m so grateful
Be glad for what you got
Feel me

Got a lot to be grateful for
But it’s never nothing wrong with wanting a little more
Can’t build and stack clout by taking the back route
Eliminating that doubt’s the only way to max out
When you young, you got the heart of a lion
And you execute the dreams with every part of you tryin’
That’s the truth, belief and confidence through the roof
And you always feel like your plans are bulletproof
But things ain’t all smooth, I hate to inform you
Disappointments come and time wears on you
Then you start to realize the tournament’s long
And the flame that you once had ain’t burning as strong
Now the prize that you’re chasing is harder to see
‘Cause the goal wasn’t easy as you thought it would be
You accomplished a few things while traveling the road
So be mindful of your come-ups and thankful for those

Uh, nah, I ain’t ridin’ in a fancy whip
And my clothes don’t cost a grip
Sometimes I barely got enough to pay
But see God woke me up today
And if the people never understand me
It’s all good, at least I got my family
See the world how you choose, I won’t debate you
But ain’t no question ‘bout mine, I’m so grateful

Your reward is on the way because you gave a lot
It ain’t about tryna match what your neighbor got
Gettin’ yours, that should be the only stipulation
Don’t base your life off another person’s situation
Yeah I know you see bad people who straight bubblin’
And you doin’ everything right and still strugglin’
Temptation’s a fast pass to live lavish
Blatant disregard for how good that you really have it
Once you let greed creep up in you, it breaks the fabric
And it’s hard for that piece to be reestablished
You lost sight of the type of life that was right for you
And feeling like there’s certain things in life that you’re entitled to
I mighta knew better if I followed the principle
That success comes from doing what you’re meant to do
Still complaining and wishing that better days hit ya
When it’s a lot who less fortunate that would trade with ya

Uh, nah, I ain’t ridin’ in a fancy whip
And my clothes don’t cost a grip
Sometimes I barely got enough to pay
But see God woke me up today
And if the people never understand me
It’s all good, at least I got my family
See the world how you choose, I won’t debate you
But ain’t no question ‘bout mine, I’m so grateful

Helping somebody’s like planting a seed
You gotta be willing to give even when you in need
Don’t wish for life to change like it magically will
You gotta start where you at now and gradually build
An envious heart can’t hide, it’s easy to spot it
Don’t focus on what he got, find out how he got it
Asking why him and not you, that left you shook
Use that energy to figure out the steps he took
When you frownin’ on what you got, hateful and mad
Imagine if you lost the so-called little you had
Appreciation would come fast when things get thin
And you’ll be praying like crazy just to have it again
Bad thoughts breed tough times when forced a lot
Am I where I wanna be in life? Of course I’m not
I don’t bathe in the bad, I endorse the good
‘Cause could my situation be worse? Of course it could
So see

Uh, nah, I ain’t ridin’ in a fancy whip
And my clothes don’t cost a grip
Sometimes I barely got enough to pay
But see God woke me up today
And if the people never understand me
It’s all good, at least I got my family
See the world how you choose, I won’t debate you
But ain’t no question ‘bout mine, I’m so grateful",https://genius.com/K-rino-so-grateful-lyrics
The Life of Love,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"Love, love-love, love-love, love-love

The initial meeting was magic, my vision was real pleased
I met her on the pasta isle near the macaroni and cheese
Despite a dose of intimidation I moved closer
Her glow was so ultra, I was nervous to approach her
Was kind out of practice, hadn't done this in a while
But much to my astonishment, I was greeted with a smile
I told her my name is K-Rino, she cut me off flat
She said ""What's your real name? Your mama didn't name you that""
As we chopped it up for a few, the similarities grew
I'm looking in the basket, ""Oh are you a vegetarian too?""
I know you in here making groceries and I ain't tryna stall you
So, I'm getta out ya way but is it alright if I call you?
She said ""Sure"", now I'm home tryna keep my cool
Killing time tryna to use the old school two day rule
When I finally picked the phone up, butterfly start to visit
I get an apprehensive feeling as I start dialing the digits
All kind of thoughts enter my mental, I start to wonder
Is this just a voicemail? Did she give me the wrong number?
I'm assuming in a few short seconds I will know
The doubt turned into elation once I heard her say ""Hello?""
(Chorus) David Sha
Love is life
And the life of love
Through the bad and good
It's so beautiful
And even when it all fades away
You can live to love
Another day, another day

As we embarked upon our first real verbal endeavor
Conversation flowed like I had been knowing her forever
We was so compatible it was laughable
The connection and energy from that natural attraction was unmatchable
The vibe she gave off was so casual
She was laid back smart and rational
Passionate not theatrical
The progression through courtship was gradual
The way she seem to travel through my every mental avenue was masterful
Three hours of phone talking nightly
In subsequent daily, text messages and emails she would write me
You know that feeling that gets in your stomach when...
Every thought that's coming from within that special someone is accomplishing
The consummation date I'm wondering
No sex or fondling or astonishing
I can't believe how many months its been
Patiently I've waited, the duration was completed
On the day that we released it expectation was exceeded
(Chorus) David Sha

Sharing home, now we entering the inseparable zone
And we so gon' that friends and family done left us alone
A minor discrepancy never was long
Respect made nothing irreparable, correctional efforts was strong
But things started gon' terribly wrong
We lost stride, love started giving way to mistrust from both sides
Animosity and lack of communication starts
Went from fiending to be together to fiending to be apart
Now attention and resentment the both of us are consumed
Gon' hours without speaking but sitting in the same room
And the same bed, but now it's like a wall is between us
Folks who knew us then wouldn't recognize us if they seen us
As the frustration levels reached a peak in escalation
The agitation graduates to daily altercation
We was both hurting, problems you can read in my face
I started feeling like Tom because I needed MySpace
See at first we was the perfect lovers
We went from speaking encouraging words to seeking out verbal slurs to hurt each other
And truthfully it's not worth it brother
I use to see deep in her other realm but now I only see the surface of her
You feel the burn, ask yourself when will you learn
Your real concern as she starts telling you that old familiar term
Yeah I love you but I'm not in love with you
In retrospect, no regrets it's for the best to break up this official
(Chorus) David Sha

Love, love-love, love-love, love-love",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-life-of-love-lyrics
Ain’t Good Enough,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"I feel for you homie
Been there
 x2
Fell victim to the system cause the hood is tough
I could've raised up and went back to the cut
Tryna do it right the old me I put it up
How can you win when your best ain't good enough?

He was fresh out the pen still in his prime
Changed his life for the better while he did his time
It's amazing how he was able too keep his mind
Came home started searching for a legal grind
Lost years mentally hard to digest
Had a woman on his side through the process
Brainstorming on some ideas they plotted big
She agreed to hold him down until he got a gig
Month after month somebody forgot to tell him (What?)
It's hard to get a job once you a convicted felon
Accumulation of trepidation and frustration
Plus alot of dust collected on his application
He stayed honest straight up and down like 6 O'clock
And clicked yes in that ""have you been convicted"" box
Everything he try to do just seem to fall though
""Thank you sir, please don't call us will call you""
 x2

Eight months deep, still same situation
Now his woman's on him daily running out of patience
The scenario they looking at is typical
Now she want him to walk it out like an elliptical
So fast forward and his manhood got targeted
And lack of them resolving it escalated those arugments
Cause how can he run his house properly
When he's clocking no profit and she constantly makes mockery
And what added to the overall discrepancy
Was the suprise un-expectancy of a pregnancy (Ooh)
And when the time came she straight dissed him
And took they buisness straight to the dirty court system
Knew he was trying hard that was nothing but greed
Took him out cause he wasn't moving at her speed
She put a good man out and let hatred in
Now he gotta make it work so let the games begin
 x2

Now it's crunch time everyday stormy weather
The need to go and get some bread is more intense than ever
Odd jobs all day tryna stack some mail
Have that money every month or go back to jail
Couldn't believe that she would place him in that situation
Though he was paying she's still hating on his visitations
When his paper slows she threaten to tell them folks
He even contemplated going back to selling dope
He was getting checks he just wasn't cashing enough
Plus his baby momma's new dude started gassing her up
""Forget that fool we need that money he don't pay it, crush him
What'chu trippin' on he ain't never gave you nothing""
All and all it was a dirty thing to do because
The real truth is she knew what kind of dude he was
He kept grinding but once again it's not enough
Fell behind, chased a lick got caught and they locked him up

Wizard’s Ransom,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"When we last left the Wizard
He had just endured the dangerous encounter with the Sorcerer's son
Only to find out afterwards that he had a son of his own
We pick up the story from there
Let's go

I said ""Hold up, did you just say that I was your dad?
I think a son is something I’d know if I woulda had
A lot just happened I’m thinking so my mind would be straight
Appreciate you, but I think this is some kind of mistake""
He said, ""I understand and kinda figure this you would say
Because I’m here and you just found out that I existed today""
I said, ""What's your mother's name?"" as he gave me a hug
He said, ""How familiar are you with the name L-Dubb""
I was relieved feeling like ""Wow I finally found her
'Cause she had disappeared shortly after our encounter
She never told me she was pregnant after all the events
She just left me and I hadn't got a call from her since
I wondered what the reasons coulda been or why you could say
Hope I don't own no intergalactic back child support pay""
He said ""We have to go right now there's work to be done""
My next adventure out of the orbit of earth had begun!

We reached our destination the following day, if I could only see her again I'd probably stay
I looked around anxiously hoping that she would appear
He said ""You seeing my mother's not the reason you're here""
Turned on a monitor and in seconds I started to see
That sorcerer's whole family was targeting me
Wasn't hard to believe knowing how we fought to achieve supremacy over each other yet I thought I was free
My son told they were coming and what we must do
I said ""How many,"" he said ""A hundred,"" I said ""Against just two?""
He said ""No sir, I've gathered reinforcements to back you""
He had transported the whole SPC in a capsule
In a room a whole crew stood simply posing
Individually roping and cryogenically frozen
Said your comrades would help you with this war with no doubt
He turned the heater up and quickly started thawin' 'em out, yeah

All my soldiers had abilities that leaked out clear
But they needed a little extra to compete out here
He said ""There's only one way,"" I said ""What is it son?""
He said ""If they get extra powers then you'll have none""
I said ""Impossible,"" he said ""Yea I've seen this before
You can give them magic talents by relinquishing yours
There's a hundred of them and two of us, so no one advance
And to leave you the way you are you would have no chance""
I said ""Okay, but they still have to be mentally trained""
He said ""No, they'll have automatically wisdom ingrained""
So he made me drink a potion that targets the brain
And in two minutes my wizardry was emptied and drained
I was simply a frame now, but happy at last
'Cause I knew my coalition would now finish the task
When he let 'em out I felt relieved to see
All of my homies 'til I saw they were coming for me
With full power and magic all of 'em were equipped
Murder One, Round Fellon, K-Water and Nip
Point Blank, PSK, Cap, Sniper, and all
I crawled out of the room and ran right down a hall
Tried to talk sense to 'em, but none of 'em would speak
My thinking was real cloudy and my body was weak
I called out to my son as I fell asking for water
He stood over me laughing and said ""You ain't my father!""

Diamonds in the Trash Can,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"It really ain’t smart to be grinnin’ and actin’ the friendliest
‘Cause many you thought to be with you are actually envious
Any unfortunate issue, they laughing continuous
When you got more than them, they wishing that you was penniless
You coming to share some news happily
Practically knowing your family’s gonna react enthusiastically
But tragically, when you tell ‘em casually
Those that have flashes of apathy begin smashing you automatically
The hope that you building, feelings’ll steal it
Your idea's a village so they drop venomous bombs down and pillage
The minute that they take time to hear it
It’s clear that their only intention is to deliberately kill your spirit
So with that I’ve conclusively concluded
That for you to keep choosing to speak what you wanna do would truly be foolish
Your dreams are valuable and vast, man
So telling them to the wrong people’s like placing a diamond in the trash can

So check it out, it’s one question I wanna ask, man
Why you putting diamonds in the trash can?
Keep your dreams to yourself, don’t tell them haters
Plan your work, work your plan, let ‘em see it later

Never tell your dreams to the miserable
They’re privately wishing you never see the fruition that make it visible
Their main move in life is to drain you
Discourage your personal gain through negativity and contain you
Their entire existence is shameful
Their own failure is painful so with the same move they try to stain you
Now you leaving what you done started cold
Plans told to a heartless soul is like dropping solid gold in a toilet bowl
Fall back, be the first to retract
‘Cause what you plan on manifesting, they’re not worthy of that
What you tryna obtain seems a non-sensible claim
Because you functioning on a incomprehensible plane
Jealous mode in effect, they don’t wanna show you respect
Pessimistic views attacking any goals that you set
Tryna slowly inject doubtful seeds over your neck
You on another level, they ain’t even noticed it yet

So check it out, it’s one question I wanna ask, man
Why you putting diamonds in the trash can?
Keep your dreams to yourself, don’t tell them haters
Plan your work, work your plan, let ‘em see it later

You thought he was your ace, letting snakes breathe in your face
You might as well let a sick patient sneeze in your face
You believe that you great, they laced with heathenous traits
Your successes are overlooked but they see your mistakes
And even though you did your best, you didn’t quite reach the top
But instead of props, they telling the people you flopped
To they own low self-esteem, they in denial
Because the worst you ever did beat they best by a mile
You continue to maintain a calm happy refrain
‘Cause you was taught not to return evil back in exchange
But shady people take advantage, they might look all real
Give ‘em an inch and they gon’ take a whole football field
Close people in your circle be hoping you come apart
Same ones who was secretly hating you from the start
Guard your jewels ‘cause fools will try to plot on the King
These diamonds exist in the mind, not on a ring

So check it out, it’s one question I wanna ask, man
Why you putting diamonds in the trash can?
Keep your dreams to yourself, don’t tell them haters
Plan your work, work your plan, let ‘em see it later",https://genius.com/K-rino-diamonds-in-the-trash-can-lyrics
Return of the Sorcerer,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Sitting in the living room no one's in the house
In and out of consciousness dozing on the couch
Approximately midnight nothing else around
Light sleep broken suddenly awaken by the sound!
The room got colder in a manner that was strange
I tried to turn the TV but the channel wouldn't change
I started feeling angry then shocked by what I've seen
No picture but a dark mist appeared upon the screen!
Five seconds later I begin to feel a threat
What was looming I'm assuming was a human silhouette
The minute that I thought to myself it couldn't get me
I looked up and saw the same image right there standing with me!
I froze up and wondered what was next for him to do
He said do you remember me cause I remember you
I said no not really but I think I have a clue
What I'm thinking in my mind though I'm hoping isn't true

It's the return of the sorcerer
You can never win
Thought you got rid of me
Now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard when I met you in my den
Now I'm back fully reloaded to challenge you again
It's the return of the sorcerer
You can never win
Thought you got rid of me
Now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard when I met you in my den
Now I'm back fully reloaded to challenge you again

No need for playing dumb asking me who is it
You know exactly who I am and why I came to visit
I said I destroyed the sorcerer he said don't tempt me
I raced to get the bag I placed him in but it was empty
I said how did you get out man I checked this every hour
He said I formed again and re connected with my power
I stay inside the bag while my energy increases
The mistake you made is that you didn't separate my pieces
So every day I got strong I life began to form
I spawned a set of horns that shoot nitrogen and bombs
You set me up the last time we met and that was rude
Now the sorcery I use is quadruple the magnitude
I must admit you prove to be a worthy nemesis
But now you have no chance of removing me from the premises
So now this vulnerable state in which I've rendered you
Has disabled the mystic wizardry that once defended you

It's the return of the sorcerer
You can never win
Thought you got rid of me
Now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard when I met you in my den
Now I'm back fully reloaded to challenge you again
It's the return of the sorcerer
You can never win
Thought you got rid of me
Now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard when I met you in my den
Now I'm back fully reloaded to challenge you again

I felt myself getting smaller breathing getting harder
He said I didn't make you shrink I made the room larger
He made his voice change into high decibel pitches
He went into my brain and started tampering with switches
He synchronized our minds and my vision got spotty
And played games by switching my head to his body
I said quit playing with my thoughts and making images
Now that I mention it please stop finishing my sentences?
Yeah, and then he started laughing
I mustered enough strength to backspin and zap him
He still standing when I know how hard I hit him
He brushed it off as if a mosquito had bit him
So now I'm getting nervous kinda feeling like it's curtains
My bodies getting weaker he's defeated me for certain
I felt my system malfunction and shutting down completely
Body affected deeply I'm not feeling good I'm sleepy

It's the return of the sorcerer
You can never win
Thought you got rid of me
Now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard when I met you in my den
Now I'm back fully reloaded to challenge you again
It's the return of the sorcerer
You can never win
Thought you got rid of me
Now I'm back for my revenge
Didn't know you were the wizard when I met you in my den
Now I'm back fully reloaded to challenge you again

He threw me in the lab I was confused by that one (why?)
Not because he put me there because I didn't have one (oh)
He came and said it's over now I can't think of much more to do
He said it's time to finish you but first I'm gonna torture you
So now I'm saying this is too insane
By then 90% of my wizardry was drained
I looked right in his face really wishing I could sign a truce
Then noticed the particle of skin on it was kinda loose
Hmmm, there might be a way that I can beat this
I recollected what he had told me about his pieces
To disassemble his physical features is his weakness
The key is knocking of that loose part if I can reach it
I used the last drop of my telekinesis
And snatch that little patch of his face fed it to leaches
He screamed as his head stared melting from the damage
As my power reestablished the rest of his body vanished!

Murda the Mainstream,UnKnown,2012.0,"Yeah, we coming for ya
Underground uprising
Motherfucker, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late
Let's go

Uh, if you scared don't ride with me
‘Cause any second I just might react violently
Every month, every year, it's the same thing
So fuck it, murder the mainstream

We specialize in agg tracks, this ain't the Rat Pack
When I'm coming at you, better duck like Aflac
Focus in on your bottom lip and then extract that
Rip it across like the flap on a snapback hat
You can't stop me, every month I'ma come
And I'm a keep on hitting licks like I was punching my tongue
Trying to be victorious against something I brung
Is like running a marathon with a dysfunctional lung
I just laugh when I watch the awards
Other than a couple legends, all that I see is frauds
Real music coming back, them some desolate odds
Women wearing slut clothes and men dressing like broads
Next year don't put no pants on, order you a gown
Homeboy you ain't no motherfucking artist, you a clown
You a slave to the Master and you still in this trap
Equivalent to a dummy on a ventriloquist's lap
Come on now

Uh, if you scared don't ride with me
‘Cause any second I just might react violently
Every month, every year, it's the same thing
So fuck it, murder the mainstream

We glorify stripping, we glorify pimping
We glorify sniffing coke and downgrading women
They planned for you to be stupid, our enemies know
You ain't a falloff pimp, you just an industry hoe
Yeah I know, you offended, when I say it, it hurts
You don't know the game? Let me show you the way that it works
The record label sign new artists, then push and promote
Commercial dance songs, freak songs and songs about dope
They pay the radio to play the shit and put it on blast
Next thing you know your 5-year-old daughter’s bouncing her ass
And your son is at a club doing a feminine dance
With an extra small shirt on and some pink ass pants
CEOs in on it, they deny it, they lying
You a damn fool if you don't see this shit is designed
And I'm knowing you probably thinking, ""So what? We paid!""
But if he gave your ass a million, think how much he made
Fool

Uh, if you scared don't ride with me
‘Cause any second I just might react violently
Every month, every year, it's the same thing
So fuck it, murder the mainstream

See I believe in that secret meeting that left the game crushed
Truth be told, I don't blame the industry, I blame us
We let money cover the fact that these cats is evil
We lost control as artists and parents and as people
See, sometimes, it's alright to dwell in the past
Even conscious rappers these days be selling their ass
No lie, chasing the high ‘cause the feeling is good
The influence of bullshit music is killing the hood
Any money that they do get, they give it right back
We in the ghetto struggling daily, we ain't living like that
They kill the music that would breed thinking, intelligent minds
Singers and rappers throwing up secret and devilish signs
Don't be fooled by the image and video represented
Them ain't his cars or his women and that mansion is rented
You serving time on the label, I'm suspending your sentence
This here's the official underground declaration of independence
Yeah

Uh, if you scared don't ride with me
‘Cause any second I just might react violently
Every month, every year, it's the same thing
So fuck it, murder the mainstream",https://genius.com/K-rino-murda-the-mainstream-lyrics
The Fallen King,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Just when K had paved the way to say that I made it
All the paper that I made, I wasn't able to save it
Maybe cause when I was paid I never gave him the praises
It's outrageous tryna reach higher material stages
Try'na view life through my own eyes, the pair I was blessed with
Cause once you touch a lot of cash your character's tested
Some wreak of a degenerate of arrogant essences
Until he's humble brought down and his talent's arrested
Knew that once I hit my peak I be a permanent fixture
The lofty height I reach was nothing like I had pictured
I was paranoid and lonely and my heart was in darkness
Standing on and looking down just made me wanna jump off it
With no sound foundation to base my investment
The power made me crazy and evasion to question
Knew deep down from the start the future greatness was destined
But the quest to chase possession is like chasing depression

You see I dwelled in the palace, bathe in the cash
I stood on the mountain top, I drank from the glass
Thought that I could rule the world, but couldn't handle the throne
In the end, The Fallen King was left standing alone
You see I dwelled in the palace, bathe in the cash
I stood on the mountain top, I drank from the glass
Thought that I could rule the world, but couldn't handle the throne
In the end, The Fallen King was left standing alone

It took a small amount of time for my greedy mind to ground me
The wealth destroyed myself and the people around me
And anything of good that men would happen to mention
Saw the people I stepped on during my rapid decision
As I fell from grace. I witness the faces above
I never once wanted the cash to take the place of the love
But it did, until my heart developed strong resistance
And the lustful things I live for were no longer sufficient
I would bask in the bank accounts of massive amounts
But there's only so much property and cash you can count
Achieving success, birds of prey bleeding my nest
All the users and the parasites that leech on your flesh
Drop my soul in every low-end, to sober these cold winds
And cover the loneliness with female over indulgence
Had it all and still had nothing, worship the wealth
The misguided king who possessed everything but himself

High on arrogance, drunk on pride
Fueled by greed, failed when I was tried
High on arrogance, drunk on pride
Fueled by greed, failed when I was tried

You see I dwelled in the palace, bathe in the cash
I stood on the mountain top, I drank from the glass
Thought that I could rule the world, but couldn't handle the throne
In the end, The Fallen King was left standing alone
You see I dwelled in the palace, bathe in the cash
I stood on the mountain top, I drank from the glass
Thought that I could rule the world, but couldn't handle the throne
In the end, The Fallen King was left standing alone

Mind state worsening, what is this I'm worshipping?
Who would be that person that could bring me down to earth again?
Humility burgeoning, ego short circuiting
Searching for a new chance on a turf like it was 1st & 10
I had a few people who try to make me reapply
And I underappreciated them, no need for me to lie
The King was a conceited guy
Who found out why it's harder for a rich man to reach heaven then a camel to pass through a needle's eye
Tears under every smile, no situation
Meant nothing unless it gave me instant gratification
They say money's not everything, and that right, it's really not
But those words are usually said by those who have none or a lot
The dynamics of our lives are greatly diversified
Happy poor folks and rich men who commit suicide
Had to lose it all just to accomplish the real prize
The King who had the fall in order to rise",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-fallen-king-lyrics
Impossible,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2015.0,"Whatever imagination breeds, that I shall do
I’m nothing like you (nothing like you)
What you deem to be impossible comes easy for me
Watch and see

I generate thought waves without using my brain
I flooded out rain, then I set fire to flame
I listen to silent music, make dumb look stupid
Somehow I’m doing sign language with no hand movement
Beat a dead man to death, made tiredness lazy
I drop phrases that drove insanity crazy
Half a tank of cross country, didn’t run no gas out
Got liquor drunk and made unconsciousness pass out
See I’m the creator of whispering thunder
I shot a bullet and counted past infinite numbers
I was walking behind my stalker while he was stalking
Parking without a car and left smoke choking and coughing
Went left, called two TECs and injected the ref
Outshot Steph and made a phone answer itself
Eyes closed shut when I stare, human hugging a bear
Walking round with a pillow, suffocating the air
Don’t try ‘cause only I can make pain cry
The men guy drop lines that got cocaine high
Why? I’ll hang a while come by rename your child
I pissed off happiness and made anger smile
I can’t even hear the noise that I make
I death rolled an alligator then I poisoned a snake
Hard to handle with my energy I’m verbally channeling
Standing across the room and saw calmness panicking
Planning to leave understanding quickly confused
Picture these moves, what I do can make victory lose
If he a star, it ain’t hard for you to pick me to spar
Sick every bar hard enough to break a brick with a straw
The plane I’m on is wingless but still I fly with it
On a freezing hot day chilling sipping on dry liquid
No sounds a night time because of the shy crickets
I was speeding slow and gave a constable 5 tickets
I eat from fruit trees that grew without seeds
I wrote 3 or 4 books before I knew how to read
I should have started a school, what a marvellous dude
At a quarter to 2 I’m swimming in a waterless pool
Anthems - I wrote a few,  I’ve got some pamphlets to show to you
Glamorous quotables doing the cameraless photo shoot
Rearranged every dictionary definition name
Came with so much game I made repetition change
I’m stange, provoke me is what I want you to do
Stronger than you, I’m sick enough to give pneumonia the flu
Mouths wired closed, words still magically spoke
Brain vast and remote, vocals made gravity float
I laid my verse from the roof, I wasn’t even in the booth
Missile-proof, I’m the one who taught honesty the truth
All rhymes disintegrated as soon as I said mine
I reassess time and gave eternity a deadline
Made 29 bullets shoot out of a peace sign
Leading from behind and going sightseeing with the blind
Crafts under the ocean, submarines in the sky
I’m so sublime I can make you have dreams when you die",https://genius.com/K-rino-impossible-lyrics
The Champion,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Yeah
This goes out to all the lyrical champions
All around the world I salute you
Cause not many people can do what we do
Ha!
Come on

Let me describe my demeanour
I'm the gladiator who teamed up with the lion and then slaughtered every person in the arena
The far distant planet born, half human and panther spawn
The neck of your most respected champion I'm trampling on
Jagged spikes on my shoes; backs: I'm dancing on
Before my enemy was ever born I wrote an answer song
And it was relevant to the presidents; I explain
When I feel disdain I instantly grow a lion's mane
This guy's insane
 but I'm too savage to try and tame
What the poison wouldn't fry his veins well let's try his brain
Lyrical superman who swings pens with a ruthless hand
And if I connect right your whole crew would land in the Yucatan
Once my talent is sharpened
I'll be able to contort and morph into a talking land-walking dolphin
A feat that you won't witness too often
Shatter your thoughts without caution like a loose bull in a porcelain auction

I'm the champion of words with steel in my nerves
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
I'm the champion of words, the mind power surge
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard

No need to wonder where my squad be cause I'm so hard G
That when I need help I pick up a phone and call me
And while my clone soars to the Earth from Zone 4
I wait inside the home until I show up at my own door
See I don't need to use a weapon fool
I'll drink rocket unleaded fuel, aim jet propelled and shoot myself at you
My first thought was to forfeit ya
No solvin' the crime til they find your body parts in the trunk of an Ultima
I only snap on war tracks I rapidly leap buildings with 90 floors flat
Skyscrapers look like door mats
Books I explore for more facts
My mic contains spikes and claws that bore through your back and tore cracks in your thorax
Then burn right through your sternum
Like twenty five hundred degree Fahrenheit strikes of ignited thermite
Mental methods were intercepted wiped out every living dentist in 20 seconds
Killin' efforts of them checkin your dental records

I'm the champion of words with steel in my nerves
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
I'm the champion of words, the mind power surge
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you never heard

State of emergency disaster no survival routes
Inside a pouch in my pocket is where I hide your house
Scar you up and bleed you in a non-violent bout
My passes cracked your skull open, his brain just started sliding out
At noon time I write a harpoon rhyme
Got arrested on Neptune for tryna transport galactic moonshine
Wars I win them, my mouth releases slimy venom
I throw water balloons that got tsunamis in 'em
I start shellacking you and leave holes in the back of you
My words enhance vision like an Acuvue contact will do
Then what occurs is the most insulting vocal slur
If you decide to go postal, I'll go postal-er
We got a lot of spirit realms which would your ghost prefer
Smoke them up until his flesh smell like roasted fur
I show up after 2 am and invade your space
And kick your door so hard it will knock over your neighbours place

I'm the champion of words with steel in my nerves
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard
I'm the champion of words, the mind power surge
In unmatched degrees of concentration I'm submerged
The metaphorical mastery, the nouns and the verbs
Light years ahead of the curve, the best you've never heard",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-champion-lyrics
Hour of the Inevitable Conquest,Alien Baby,2011,"We've reached the hour, ha
There's no turning back

You losing's a forgone conclusion
I'm using atomic thought drawn car bomb Illusions
And hard arm contusions, embalming fluid transfusions
The catalyst of war torn art form improvement
The brain enema giver with the cleverness of cinema
The side effects entered before the medicines administered Weapons are intercepted 'cause my mental's eclectic
Double directed, concurrently entered you and exit
His essence left him in seconds with no molecules separate
With no possible fossils or birth records to reference
I'm blessed with plethoras of undetectable micro guns
Nitro pyrotrons that strike and ignite your lungs
I'll rake my claws across whatever I put bars
6 foot anatomies mauled with 7 foot scars
My verses made your throat hurt
From age 5 to age 5 and a half I had a 3 foot growth spurt

The planet is at unrest
World dissatisfaction has brought about the hour of the conquest
Total dictatorship, no signs of hope
Surrender or get caught up in the wave of the revolt

Be concerned as I turn up the furnace
He was burned from internal to epidermis, my energy exothermic
In a tower with inferno with the radiation thermal
Let me take you on a journey where each hour's eternal
Please walk at me consciously
The pen marks but in a forest a tree of artists is what started my artistry
The definite article of rap sovereignty, no one is hard as me
No, not approximately or even arguably
I thank God for blessing me marvelously
Depositing bars and involving me in the lyrical parliamentary
The code is red, I unloaded lead and left a whole row of your soldiers dead
The top edge of my pen is a living cobra's head
Galaxies are being fed
I read a mind reader's mind to let him know I knew my mind was being read
Great authors I'm the king of 'em
There's only 18 supreme thinkers in the universe and I'm 17 of them

The planet is at unrest
World dissatisfaction has brought about the hour of the conquest
Total dictatorship, no signs of hope
Surrender or get caught up in the wave of the revolt

No risk, no reward
To determine human existence is not hard
But you can't measure the distance of God
Our ideological synergy sits on ethereal peripheries
And carry no conceptual deficiencies
We travel in a litany of infantries and spend centuries debunking histories of myths and inconsistencies
The God cypher platform is what we rest upon
And only the most aggressive ones will reach the highest echelon
We fly crafts that are more than capable of racing through and taking you
Receiving satellite feeds that are untraceable
Sometimes I even astonish me
Especially when I anatomically become an unexplained light anomaly

Everybody done heard of studio gangsters
But you know what, studio gangster is somebody who talk hard on the record but they ain't, they weak in real life
You know they got studio lyricists out here too
People that talk like go hard on the microphone on they records
And then when it's time to represent it in a battle or just flowin' they can't get down like that
But I'mma let y'all boys know that I'm the ONE

They might just lock me up for sound abuse
Bite like a brown recluse, I found a noose
That grips the ground tight enough to break a town a loose
Reached back and slapped you cause you questioned my validity
It took a month for my hand to hit him cause my swing started in Italy
I'm finna diss my nemesis, till he's removed from the premises
Twisted chemist with brain cells that are limitless
The mic chord strangles, a lifeless corpse dangles
My inner-changeable language hangs with a snake by your ankles
We can do this for fun or we can make bets
I break necks with threats while your cassetts get regurgetated from tape decks
Can't digest my words the first time, so you rewind
I'll write a verse across your brain and let the people read your mind
You're tryna get at me, not knowin my words crushin the South
The style I catch so super sick, it left preachers cussin you out
You stumblin over words that'll leave your skin crumblin
All they found was his mouth on the ground hoppin' and mumblin'

I'm The One, not the 2 not the 3
I'm the aggravated lyricist straight out of the S.P.C. (South Park Coalition)
I'm The One, I ain't the three or the fo'
Y'all get knocked up out the frame tryin to step to K-Rino
Coz I'm The One, not the 2 or the 3
I'm the aggravated lyricist straight out of the S.P.C
Yes I'm The One, not the three or the fo'
Y'all get knocked up out the frame tryin to step to K-Rino

(I love to release with steal?) out hollow fools
My knowledge left scholars bruised
My esophagus rockets fumes solid pools of kinetic acidic molecules
I'm never rattled in hand, lyric or gun battle
I straddle hurds of untamed cattle with one saddle
Dyin from the pain, tried to complain, but see I knew it mane
Once a month I take out my brain and let the fluid drain
Battlin' me is like you and a girlfriend so you resent it
Cause when it comes to either one, yo ass couldn't last a minute
My lyrics trigger hypnosis and doses of multiple sclerosis
My high explosives infected most with tuberculosis
I slapped men, half of this raps I leave them trapped in
Adapt in any climate, absorbin' oceans with one napkin
I'll focus, and fill up your stomach with dead locust
The head exploders scare MCs worse than a Red-Notice
Put rappers to work, instead of a check I send them a page
5 lyrics a week is equal to more loot than minimum wage


Now I done witnessed every move plus I done pulled every stunt
They call me period cause I come visit your girlfriend once a month
You keep throwin disses at me fool here's what your goin to witness
Enough shoes up in yo ass to put Footlocker out of business
Your calculation was way off, your practice didn't pay off
How the hell you gonna win a ring and you ain't even much met the playoffs
Erase your name up off the map then start engravin mine
And set yo ass back like a clock, when it's daylight savings time
When it's over, all your lil' partners they gonna know you got tossed
You couldn't handle me if I was a basketball and your name was hot sauce
If I got beef with a grown man Imma say his name clean
I wouldn't care if you was underground, local or mainstream
I'll spit 3 raps to make things rehabilitate then relapse
Yo flow is dead, they couldn't find yo skill with 12 key maps

Every time they take a step forward they get knocked two back
You know what I'm saying?
You ain't by yourself
It ain't no need to feel sorry for yourself
Just step your game up ya feel me?

My blessings in the world come from only three letters
I analyze life through a blind man's eyes to see better
I'm thanking for hard times and every problem I gained
'Cause struggle is ordained and one of life's best lessons is pain
The decisions I made, I made 'em with no shame in my game
Took the bad with the good just like a man that never place blame
A mind stay twisted, can't even tell the crooked from straight
We give up on love but never seem to run out of hate
Seems like you gotta almost die before you learn how to live
One of the biggest things a man can do is learn to forgive
We didn't have much but grateful every night I pray
Knew we was poor, but we was happy just to go out and play
And these fools thinking they understand the problems we have
Raised in the hood learning to mean mug before I could laugh
If it's about money and happiness I'm down to pursue it
And don't be talking about you feel me if you ain't never been through it

Life's so full of deception and lies
Look deeply and see the pain in my eyes
Why do I fall when I'm supposed to rise, the more I try?

I see this world is on its last leg like nobody cares
Can't even pray to God, the Feds tapping my prayers
How can I strive to show love when I'm surrounded by hate?
Why even bother choosing friends when they so shallow and fake
How come your main mission in life is to take me fast?
Because if they ain't after your broad then they after your cash
Busters befriend me but they plot for my wealth
Could it be that they see more in me then they see in they self?
I been rich been poor been both places before
Hit the pen now I know just what patience is for
Got me pacing the floor now my life is so rough
And if I look back on past I could have avoided this stuff
How can you preach to me my baby need shoes, my baby is in schools
And I can find no positives playing by y'all rules
Klondike Kat done seen some dark days so I just can't front
Man, your pace will get you 25 to avoid 6 months

Life's so full of deception and lies
Look deeply and see the pain in my eyes
Why do I fall when I'm supposed to rise, the more I try?

Born in an aggravated mood, swallowing game like food
They say I'm ghetto but I take that as a compliment dude
It ain't take long for the hood to put some hair on my balls
Never did dirt because I feared my mama more than the Laws
Maybe we'll stop tryna take from somebody and give more
They got us out here thinking it ain't nothing to live for
You got your thing I got mine and when it rains it pours
I can't look down on you cause my sin ain't no better than yours
And the friendship between two partners really ain't strong
And we can't tell each other 'bout ourself when we in the wrong
Is you a G or a faker that will sellout your brothers?
Do you do good because it's right or to be noticed by others?
See I understand why people shoot slugs and do drugs
If you was in the conditions we was you'd do it too, cuz
That why we dying over nonsense laid out like a pallet
If you gon' die or kill just make sure that the reason is valid
We know what pain is and what these devils tryna do
It's hard to listen to your mama when she higher than you
Can't show no weakness in this world, even the females is hard
Out here putting your faith in man like you ought to do God
For sure

Without Him no material or life form would exist an ounce
The author of the galaxies the one who atheists denounce
God could speak to you in an unknown voice
But it's best line in contact is through your own voice
The one inside you that guides you and helps you ride through
The rough tides that alleviate pride like the wise do
Will you hear Him? Will you recognize it?
It's obvious that it's deposited within you but self-hatred disguise it
He's speaks too us then through us then feeses His spirit
But before you could speak the word you first gotta hear it

Now that God is talking, who is listening?
He sent the message to the shrimpers and the fisherman
To the weatherman and all the economist
The media mobiles down to your local gossip columnist
He warns what the problem is
Stop doing the following worshipping corporations that hollow out nations and swallow men
Exploiting the woman and children
Fooling the citizens by blowing up the buildings
Using the prophet's name to disguise the dirty religion
Keeping the racism 'cross the state of division
So God's in-division is instrumental
The system is corrupt from the jaw up to the presidential
And higher levels, where you get higher knowledge you see the higher devils
Rapid fire from rebels and greater odds
Will you learn to speak the language of God?
Figuring out who is really talking and his name isn't hard
You can pick out the flaws
And avoid not hearing the truth, you can trace the prove back to his roots
And what he constitutes meaning what is consistent of
The main characteristic of what I'm speaking of is love

Have you ever heard the voice of God and obeying what was said?
Heard the voice in ya head and thought back to the bible you read?
Well I do it, it happens all the time each and everyday
To know the word and not obey, my life is in disarray
Chance after chance but I come up with the same ole song
Not taking his grace for granted but still I choose him right over wrong
I hear God's voice and it's powerful, full of conviction
Never a contradiction, just rules to defeat the opposition
Have you ever heard God works in mysterious ways?
And will never let'cha down and deserves unlimited praise?
Listen close and pay attention, he ain't hard to find
Some say he might not come when ya want but he's right on time
He ain't gon' force you to follow him when you hear his voice
He leaves it all up to you, so you make the choice
And I believe that with every ounce of body and soul
So be obedient to his commandments to reach the ultimate goal

Eh, Yeah
I hear him
Even at the time I felt the presents of God walking with me
Talking to me, but the darkness in me would argue with he
I borrow my own conscience till my conscience with God's responsive
Rushing full speed ahead with the nonsense
Did what I wanted walking a fine line between sanity and insanity
If war was seven devils: envy, greed, lust, and vanity
But it was rare to set me on the path to being a main nigga
With my gift became crisper for God's voice became a whisper
I was OG you knew me, hose be like whose he?
'Cause I got my paper either by oozy or ooze
I'm really started to lose me, chained by my own pain
With the God I was His people till his voice became a mutant
And I can't change gears
I lost my mother and my son in the same year
And I still can't hear after death came near
I'm slipping into a dark war
To the honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan I heard God's voice",https://genius.com/K-rino-gods-voice-lyrics
What You Gonna Do,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"(K-Rino)
We be back street flipping stacking slipping
Money coming clean and these laws still tripping
I'm a certifiied street cat cash flow holder
A double OG with hood stripes on my shoulders
Every now and then a hater make be a headbussa
South Park son of a Third Ward Hustla
Who came up in the ranks and then tighten up my skills
You just got here last month you capping, let's be for real
If they put some pressure on you boy I bet you blow the whistle
Fool you ain't a man just because you pack a pistol
Out here poisoning your hood you lil ignorant mothafucka
And let the white man condition you to kill your own brother
See, gangster is a title earned better learn fast
Not tattoos on your arms your pants hanging off your ass
Your vision of the American Dream ain't what it seems
Open your eyes young homie you fighting your own team

What you gonna do when your hustle fall dead
The boys start checking you on every word that you said
When you start getting snatched by these racist ass hogs
And the friends that you thought you had throw you to the dogs
What you gonna do if martial law come around
And these laws rush in and start shutting things down
And the life that you thought was real proof counterfeit
And the money that you kill over's no longer worth shit!
(K-Rino)
Nowadays it's a known fact snitching is contagious
Half the fools you think is real is illuminati agents
You flunked the semester with your artificial flyness
Your overall grade in the hood is a F minus
How many blacks do these laws gotta kill
Before we start busting back on their ass with loaded steel?
Instead we see them coming fold up or run
Preachers scared to square them off that's why I roll with Farrakhan
And they taping conversations every sort
So don't say nothing on the phone that you might hear again in court
Here we are, throwed off the black family ruined
Analyze today these shit that your kids see you doing
If you been selling dope for ten years and hustling tough
And you ain't rich enough to stop it's time to give the game up
Get your understanding up and try to see the big picture
Bottom line is they want your ass them bastards gon get ya

(K-Rino)
Hellified gun fire flying through the night
How many homies gotta die before we get our minds right?
My homegirl's a stripper not because of reflation
It's cuz her sorry ass don't wanna go get a real occupation
We don't know we God's people so we see our own and flame them
But then again if they ain't got the knowledge then how can you blame them?
Self-righteous ass negros get hung from a limb
Cuz if you got it and you don't teach them then you worst then them
What category do you fall in: the G or the hater?
The sellout or the warrior, the real homie or the traitor?
Hoops or the branches, the angel or the menace?
Fools that sold out to receive or reduce sentence
How the hell you fix your month to say you fighting for freedom
When like a corner store in the hood you just pimp them and bleed them
The Devil's curriculum was formatted to trick them
If you scared of revolution I hope you the first victim",https://genius.com/K-rino-what-you-gonna-do-lyrics
I Need A Moment,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"Say, tomorrow you could see your last Sun or last Moon
Feel like I'm bleeding out from emotional stab wounds
It's like a storm, we just hoping that it pass soon
Girl had a baby in that gas station bathroom
It ain't no break for some of us, man everyday be tough
These drugs got our young people doing some crazy stuff
Fast trigger take a life as a show of force
And even after they kill 'em they showing no remorse
18 and your life already minimized
The judge sentenced him to more time than he'd been alive
Ain't no winners, when it's over it's a lose-lose
So much hate for each other we some confused dudes
How many lost in the game, I know plenty names
Seem like a little money'll make people do anything
I'm sitting up, heartbroken from this killing mane
After the fact it's a shame, what did you really gain?

Everyday it's getting worse
I need a moment just to calm my nerves
I'm only looking out for you
Dialing the number but I can't get through

Lets keep it real, blacks die when the police come
Unarmed, shot for no reason, matters where we from
Same type of video, it's like watching a rerun
Then they twist it on the victim and question what he'd done
And on the ground lies the physical remnants of him
Turn on the TV, they paint a negative image of him
Quit telling me to forgive 'em because I'm above trying
If God don't love his enemies why would I love mine?
Watching a brother get shot up by police till he die
Seeing the life exit his body, man that's something I
Just can't describe how bad it hurt me, I'm finna cry
Like Cuba Good in Boyz n the Hood punching the sky
I'm on my guard now, feeling like one day I'ma kill
I know if I'm hurting like this, think how his momma feel
You took a father from a baby, husband from a wife
But in your mind it's just another worthless nigga's life

Everyday it's getting worse
I need a moment just to calm my nerves
I'm only looking out for you
Dialing the number but I can't get through

And what's even more heartbreaking
Is seeing us kill each other with no thoughts taken
Thinking 'bout way way back, hard to envision how
That baby you used to pack around, he in prison now
The overall situation left a lot ruined
I'm like, ""Damn, if only I could have got to him""
No where to hide, everybody on the spot knew him
Influenced by some reckless things he wouldn't stop doing
Left or right? Which direction is the choice within ya
You a God, you just got that Devil poison in ya
Don't even know who he is, I pray the Lord reveal him
I go to jail for whooping my child but you get to kill him?
I seen people try some dope one time then they fiends
Our children be committing suicide in their teens
It's never over even though you had a hard life
I wish you knew how special that you are in God's sight

Everyday it's getting worse
I need a moment just to calm my nerves
I'm only looking out for you
Dialing the number but I can't get through",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-need-a-moment-lyrics
Tellin’ On Um,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"This is the time
Where the gloves come off
You can’t stand on the sideline in this fight
Innocent bystanders get they heads blown off
Let’s go, yeah

Make no mistake, we don’t hate, we are the victims of it
Hatred next to love, if it’s your choice, hatred gets picked above it
You know all we want is justice, that’s how come you tricked the public
‘Cause it’s something you don’t wanna give us so you switched the subject
Well we might as well go ‘head and make you mad
And since you're mad, you lied and made a protest ‘bout the flag ‘cause your intentions bad
But since you wanna mention flags, ok yeah let’s mention flags
The same ones you lynched black people under with your lynchin’ ass
Stand for what? Y’all let the military implement that trash
The NFL did that for the cash, bastards pimp the flag
Salute Minister Farrakhan, he showed us the flag code
It’s disrespect to lay it flat or even wear it as clothes
Every move made is to put us behind those steel bars
Shady media misleadin’ ya about the real cause
Check the reconstruction era, then go look up Jim Crow
Black poverty was planned but you never hear that from them though
So give us faulty education, oppressors deny us jobs
Then act like you don’t know why we broke, hungry and why we rob
You just tryna fill them prisons up and max out the volume
The crime at the top is the reason for crime at the bottom
Every mass murderer occurrence you tag a Muslim with it
Till you find out a gun-packing militia Christian did it
Pissed off at the government and thought that was the right step
Or flip then shot a college campus up because his wife left
These damn savages like death, what they do is irreparable
So how come everybody is a terrorist except for you?
Chemicals in damn near everything we drink or eat up
They know you love weed so they ampin’ the THC up
And I ain’t even got to Trump, you sayin’ this man is human
Who the hell you fooling? Your staff look like a Klan reunion
Take it how you choose but voting won’t get us out of this
And you’s a damn fool if you think our ancestors died for this
This is what the coons and the racists can’t stomach
They cringe from it, I can already see the comments
They know the facts but they deflect it and start fights
Following Tomi Lahren's stupid ass and the alt-right
But who’s the real life slaughterers of a culture
The vultures responsible for the massacre in Tulsa
Independence we had it, but a short time it lasted
And I’m still flashing back to Emmett Till’s open casket
You mad ‘cause they don’t acknowledge your right for open carrying
That’s only ‘cause you running ‘round thinking you an American
Double standards disparaging, your governments are crooks for certain
Draft-dodging president, he lied and said his foot was hurting
Always got a blanket to cover him up when he exposed
And feed you the distractions of drugs, liquor and TV shows
Instagram, Facebook, sports, music and freaky shows
World falling around us and our eyes are completely closed
The heat’s coming, you can’t fight them flames
You so conditioned now that you actually like them chains
Zionists using their powers to influence the whole
Scary black organizations under Jewish control
False-flagging just to see how the people respond
You wanna murder black students, give those teachers a gun
Won’t be long till the universal mystery’s straight
Lies take the place of truth now in history’s hate",https://genius.com/K-rino-tellin-on-um-lyrics
M.O.A.N. (Missed Opportunities And Negligence),The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"HAHA!

All alone, gazing at the stars at home, thoughts are gone
Thinking of a girl who used to kiss the ground I walked upon
Still I didn't lift her up, thought her love was bottomless
I never appreciated her level of tolerance
Verbally abusive with her, kept her feeling low and used her
Partners told me man you better treat her right before you lose her
She ain't going nowhere fool, wisdom I ain't try'na listen
Came home one day looked around, all her clothes and stuff was missing
Why she playin, let me call her, we goin add this drama out
Cell phone number disconnected, bet she at her mama house
Waited for her day and night, she need to get off the gas
Sitting around still waiting, two years and a month done passed
Realizing my foolish ways, too late now but after while
Seen her at a restaurant, with her husband and a child
Now since I'm a wiser man, I'm happy to see her free
Even though it seems like she got better after leaving me
WOW
Can you believe that?
Can you believe that?
I never would have conceive that

It make me wanna (MOAN)
Missed Opportunities And Negligence
Didn't cherish what I had and hurting from it ever since
(It make me wanna moan)
Self-inflictive digits I was falling in
Would have done it different if I had to do it all again (Moan)
Sometimes I moan
Sometimes we moan
Sometimes I moan
Sometimes we...

He was tryna be a hustler get a street diploma
Fascinated by them chromes they make out on the corner
Everybody said them streets goin be the death of you
Mad cause mama fussing, she just want the best for you
Youngsta thought he knew it all, can't nobody tell em nothing
Ever since I could remember, lil' daddy been selling something
Jammed him up a couple times, own homies dropping dimes
Made it through without a scratch, still ain't recognize the signs
Met a chick out on the street, hooked up and begun to love her
Brought her in the middle of his business, put no one above her
He got busted went to jail, thought she be the one to suffer
Seen his woman at the trial, found out she a undercover
Didn't save no cash for lawyers, court appointed worst defenders
Judge gave him 11 years, crazy for a first offender
Bailiff let him out the room, down the hall and straight to prison
Mama's word resonating in his memory, 'you should've listened'


Years ago this fella had a son but didn't stay to name him
Had him from a girl he didn't love so he refuse to claim him
She was just another victim that he smashed killing time
His own mama said the baby looked just like him, still denying
She promised it was his child, every night she cry and cry
Anytime she ask for money, he would leave her high and dry
Finally she said forget it, even thought that stance was hard
She gave up and let him make it, put it in the hands of God
Now the child is getting older, hanging with the other kids
Broke his mother's heart when he would ask her who is father is
Had no answers years passed, he removed it from his thoughts
Mama raised him well, making grades and real good in sports
Scholarships, grown scouts, TV man he blowing up
Looking like he 'bout to make it, here come daddy showing up
Son said where ya been? You can't ease back in my life again
I don't need you now you should of came when I needed you then",https://genius.com/K-rino-moan-missed-opportunities-and-negligence-lyrics
Non-Stop,No Mercy,1999.0,"One time for your mind
Shane 80 is Kuwait
In here with the god , K-Rino
Ain't no playing 'em, baby
It's 1999 (Don't try this at home)
Fo' sure

In a dark prism, vision microphones moving in motion
Volcanic vocalism sparking flames beneath the ocean
Deep rhyme production, advanced psychological powers
Time rearranger, seconds take minutes, minutes take hours
Put venom in veins, when I'm in brains witness the pain
Adrenaline gain, speed so quick I'm dodging rain
Rough narrator strangulation gave him a red collar
Deranged writer, paragraphs making the dead holler
The mad magician flashing my South Park diploma
Manipulate minds, wrote 20 rhymes inside a coma
The speed reader studied wise books to learn how ya
Heart is heat, bring a hellafied, enough to burn fire, yo
Battles telepathic skill destined to get ya
Might read your mind while you kick your rhyme and say it with ya
Had side effects from multiple doses of lethal lithium
Lyrical blast, imbalance the planet's equilibrium
Unexplainable, mic missile launcher lyrics untameable
Voice master with 3 vocal cords that's interchangeable
Show the wrath of violent hurricanes when I finish
No photograph, my body won't sustain visual image
Come face the lesson, incarceration my topic locks
Through space compression planets, in a microscopic box
The dream controller, reach in my thoughts and grab a vision
Ideas burn at top speed, mental metabolism
Deep time first, so all future lyrics I never lay 'em
Each rhyme verse be on tape a week before I say 'em
Solidified my status, weakened your vital signs
Composed chapter tonight, it takes you weeks to write a line
I giveth, distribute the punches nobody throws rougher
My flows tougher than leather, love it when my foes suffer
Too rough on the same level, we ain't gonna never be super thinkers
Sending unsolvable questions to jeopardy
Murder serenade, computer thought device I empower
Woke and counted every molecule on Earth in an hour
Invade your satellite, the TV frequencies I dismantle
Now I'm strangling a different punk on 200 channels
High velocity, genetic cloning, coming in threes
Now there's 4 versions of K-Rino blow torching MC's
Solar energy ignites concepts, spray like a gun killing
Heated you cool enough to be up on the Sun chilling
Chaotic madness I exert the explosion
Bodies eternally twisting in a circular motion
When I come in the game, click this thought to flowing vital
Dropping 30 flows a night like I was tryn'a win a scoring title
The best you ever heard is agg in my temple
Multidimensional, my clever words make calculus simple
Weak styles missing in action once I got 'em I hit
Hyperactive butcher knife packing mental bottomless pit
Bring a 100 MC's still, it ain't no stopping this injection
Making the planet spin up in the opposite direction
I wreck, punish the prisoner, it's sad how I do him
Tied him up for 22 days and read his own rhymes to him
Step to my right, that's a wrong turn so make a left
Suffocate you but once a month I'll let you take a breath
Stepping to us, one fuss, death is a must
You cuss so I'm a bust, might just turn him to dust
The king drama I sing, I fling lyrics that sting
Quick death is what I bring, one swing he's out the ring
Can't cope 'cause I'm to dope, I hope you brought your scope
My quote punctured his throat, you spoke so get a rope
I'm still a threat to kill, too real to lose my skill
I spill verses you feel, done deal so write your will
I sing just like dream, my theme murdered your team
You scream feeling the steam of extreme nuclear beams
Induce lyrical juice, this noose I put to use
Crack the atom open, letting all of matters rhyme spirits loose
I keep on going while competitors drop

"Past, Present, Future",The Blood Doctrine,2008.0,"Sometimes you look forward and backwards

I meditated at home alone in an introspective zone
When my conscious mind takes on a deep reflective tone
As I laid afraid and replayed mistakes that I've made
Depression covered me with his dark shade and cut like a blade
Should I seek advice from somebody that knows me the most?
Just as I asked a familiar figure slowly approached
I don't believe in paranormal beings or all-seeing ghosts
But everything he told me and everything he showed me was close
I didn't understand his motives or his purpose with me
My assessment was he could be 22 or 23
As my visual started burgeoning and emerging I see
That this person indeed was just a younger version of me
He said he had words that were of the most urgent degree
Apologized for things that he had caused to occur mentally
He knew decisions that he had made led to my discouragement, G
Said at the time he couldn't see where all of the turbulence be
Said history never produced a more deserving MC
That had received less and had packed a greater burden than me
""If I could merge ya knowledge now with ya fire from '93
Just imagine how dangerous and disturbing it might be""
He showed me bad moments in my life that could've been nice
Times I would've won, but I went left when I should've went right
But once you done it, well it's over, that's a permanent rule
Problems I could've missed had I made an alternative move
He reminded me well that I sat on a throne with a veil
Now I'm lonely as hell, broken down and only a shell
Of my former self and that's something I hated to say
Just when I asked if I could make it right, he faded away

Three levels of my existence will clash
When my present meets my future and my past
How long will my rationale last?
When my present meets my future and my past

Man, what just happened to me?
I must've blacked out or something man
I feel like, I feel like I'm in another dimension man
What's really going on?

The psychological effects of pain I failed to withstand
To recover from it, the average man seldomly can
Someone tell me the plan, I looked and saw an elderly man
And he began to place me under a deep spell with his hand
I couldn't believe that he was contrived to deceive me in lie
He was feeble and shy and much older than the previous guy
I relaxed like I was high, relief I was breathing aside
He said that he would speak and that I would have no need to reply
He told me of things that I was yearning in my past was a tree of learning
Said my future wasn't planned and that nothing was predetermined
Said don't focus on rejection and personal imperfections
Showed me sections of my life I should take in different directions
I couldn't see his face at all, only a silhouette flaming
Said there would be no deal in explaining until I became him
What you see in front of you is the same form I remain in
It's up to you to add to the frame of what you'll be gaining
If you devote your ethereal hope and spiritual growth
Look in the mirror close and apply, not just hear what I spoke
Don't think current obstacles last, there's no impossible task
You could profit with cash, the future has optional paths
I can't reveal every dimension, I'm just showing you some
I warn you now about the pitfalls so you'll know when they come
First start your divorce, weak hearted thoughts of remorse
I can't divulge too much, there's a chance you'll alter the course
This warning is sound, right now you got thorns in your crown
But I'm a image of potential reform, born to astound
I see you speculating blatantly, no need to mistake me
Yeah, I'm you 20 years from now, but what will you make me?

Three levels of my existence will clash
When my present meets my future and my past
How long will my rationale last
When my present meets my future and my past?",https://genius.com/K-rino-past-present-future-lyrics
S.O.T.S, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Y'all ain't gon’ believe this
I said, y'all ain't gon’ believe this

I was in my study reading back a song I had wrote
While periodically flipping channels on the remote
Switched to my office chair, reclined it to a backwards position
In my peripheral I saw an image pass through the kitchen
What would add to suspicion was my lock was fastened so if in
Fact someone was is in my house, he was a classic magician
Must be tripping, so I laid up in the tub just to rest
When I came back into the kitchen there he was in the flesh
At this point I started thinking that it's highly incumbent
To let whoever this was know that this was getting redundant
All my enemies had been slaughtered in massive abundance
Over the years I had eliminated three or four hundred
So I'm puzzled at the presence of a brand new foe
He said, ""I'm twice as dangerous as any man you know""
Gave him a show of power, still couldn't force him to run
I said, ""Who are you?"" He just laughed and said, ""The Sorcerer's son""

""So you're Sorcerer's son?"" as I drank me some water
I guess you've come here with plans of avenging your father
I told him, “Don't even bother though you have every right to
The chapter is behind me and I'm not gonna fight you”
He said, ""If that's your decision, it pleases me still
‘Cause if you don't defend yourself, then you'll be easy to kill
I've studied every trick you've done and I can see through ‘em all""
He flung a fireball that hit me and knocked me through the wall
I'm laying in the pile of rubble with a dent in my face
I said, ""My landlord gon’ be tripping man, I'm renting this place""
He said, ""My father was the best warrior in the annals of time
So beating you will automatically make that title mine""
I guess he didn't have the wisdom that I thought that he had
“Your dad was a twisted narcissistic sociopath
Who terrorized the galaxy and did nothing but damage
So why don't you take your little young ass back home to your planet""

He got real real angry at my cynical sentiment
Then laughed and said, ""The magic I was using was primitive""
I tried to run out the door and get to the main road
But my living room had turned into an active volcano
I'm scared ‘cause now I see that he was clever indeed
He made the planet spin ten times its regular speed
My body was flying everywhere, battered and beaten
But through the chaotic conditions, he was still on his feet
I saw my weakness detecting scanner inside my backpack
If I can grab it, I can scan him and see where to attack
So as I flew by I snatched it and aimed at his head
The data processed but somehow it scanned me instead
Showed him every single weakness that I had in my mind
Then aggressively started attacking them one at a time
Inside was a war but outside the same as before
The Sun was shining then a little kid knocked on my door
When nobody answered I'm thinking he leaving, forget us
That's when I noticed then that somehow he was inside with us
I was worried ‘cause he walked about the whole room freely
And as I looked puzzled, he calmly said, ""He can't see me""
Then the little boy waved his hands, dropped to his knees
As the Sorcerer's son fell I saw his oxygen leave
I was amazed at the skill he was displaying, in fact
He kept taking his life, waking him up and taking it back
This dude didn't even have blood but somehow he bled
After ten minutes of torture he got up and he fled
I shook my injuries, astonished at the power he had
Then I said, ""Thank you little man."" He said, ""No problem dad!""

My letter use so indelible it's registered edible
Catch then compress the breath from you until neck is loose
Strengthen a mass so enemies couldn't harass me
My patience is fast infinity couldn't outlast me
I write in secrecy at peak speeds
My P.A.D's release a lethal meesel breed if i don't keep them in the deep freeze
Bars strange with unlimited linear range
My mind-frames a street with two thousand and twenty two lanes
Ill change into the baby me
And still disable these basic weak fake emcees
With two phrases usin just letter's a through e
So truthfully what could you do to me
When im the super g whos at the podium readin the reapers eulogy
My microphone is several feet long
My speech tones are so strong that when i speak them i shatter my own cheek bone
Everyone i hated gets congregated
Ill take your lung out and confiscate it
Then stomp on it till its uninflated
Greatly underrated yet im your favorite
Ill play with your brain and make it so basic that 1 plus 1 will look complicated
Check the feeds that my head retrieves
Enemies not yet conceived callin and threatnin me
Pressin yellin and question me aggressively
Seekin to get the recipe to my expertise
Its a must to see us humiliate artists publicly
Subjects be deep enough to make hate fall in love with me
The light supplier expired writer of fireworks
One entire verse could make a glass of water die of thirst
I'm usin veteran moves one incredible dude
Hearin two of my songs is like goin through medical school
None escape from my monstrous fate
I dominate n concentrate drifting in and out of conscious state
I spit poison ivy when you try me
And just to sit beside me you gotta show 100 forms of ID
My sickly gifts i can prove quickly
When i stand in the mirror and move my reflections scared to move with me
Im filled with electric type skills
So anytime i write foreal i get a seven thousand dollar light bill
I kill and double back after pretending to leave
Then i proceed doin squats never bendin my knees
Ima press my hands around ya neck slow
And even tho i saw ya final breath ima squeeze another month before i let go
Ill leave ya broken like the pesh mode
A handwoven flesh robe is the dress code to get into my next show
My work station is the seed of creation
New innovations like spontaious premeditation
I start crushin em all with no reluctance involved
Showup and drop sixty without touchin the ball
Proliferate and test the greats
Articulate at such a record pace i made the number 1 finishin second place
The suit perfer was certin to come produce hurt
Used physics in reverse i built the house and hung the roof first
Your two tasteless audaciously baseless
You flagrently take your patrients to flacious places
Blaze ya sanctuary chasin you away from its safeness
Then weaken you till you can't even raise somethin thats weightless
Im breakin company rules
So confident i can run through these fools lyrically while getting my tonsels removed
Ill steer into jet gear the exosphere exterior threat here
Lookin at footage of myself from next year.....
Yeah who is this guy",https://genius.com/K-rino-connectivity-lyrics
Escape to the Unknown,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"When I finally opened my eyes (What happened?)
I realised that I was in a small compartment, minimal in size
I wanted to go back to sleep but then I noticed I was trapped in deep and my limbs, even though they were intact were weak
The place had no electricity
Plus I couldn't see due to its natural limited visibility
I'm suffering man cause I ain't trusting this place
I can hear folks on the outside discussing my fate
And my initial thought was, ""Where's the phone?"" But as
I glanced over to my left I found out that I wasn't in there alone
Another guy was laid out on the other side, now I'm nervous
Thinking, ""What happened? Maybe this brother died""
If this is true then there's a chance I might be next to lose it
So I nudged him with my hand just to check for movement
And then he popped up, which startled and appalled me
He started yelling and panicking, asking me, ""Where are we?""
I said, ""I have no idea, I was stuck when I woke
But whoever's responsible for this abducted us both""
He looked suspicious, I told him I had no reason to lie
I asked his name, he said, ""I don't know"", I said ""Neither do I""
Now we had to escape, somehow we were cast in this place
Now I'm drawing a mental blank, it's like my past was erased
I told him, ""Calm down, relax, I know your mind is in doubt
But if we put our heads together we can find a way out""
We started searching, but still we saw no traces at all, we looked to find something we could use to break through the wall
We saw nothing, now we're kicking and punching to no avail
This is either a potent spell or we've been forced to go to Hell
If there's a way in, there's a way out and I'll prove it's a fact
He was losing his composure and I knew he would crack
A day passed and I heard those same voices again
A combination of panicked women and boisterous men
They mentioned me and the other guy and those among us cried
They said, ""In order for one to survive then one must die""
Right then I knew we had to make it out, no matter the cost
Knowing the life of one of us was to be shattered and lost
As I started devising a plan, I quickly realised that this man
Was sliding up beside me, rising his hand
He was attacking me at any open spot he'd see
He said, ""If one of us gotta die it will not be me""
I said, ""If we get right to the source no life will be lost""
I was trying to talk him out of it while fighting him off
He wasn't hearing it, he fought me while I'm lending him help
I soon stopped talking and started defending myself
An alliance had gone bad after I thought it was good, I grabbed him round the neck and started squeezing hard as I could
The future life span would be granted to the tougher man
As we scuffled and waged war to gain the upper hand
Over and over again the commotion would go and then
I heard a person on the outside, ""Tell him I'm going in""
After that, we wasn't fighting and choking no more
We were anxiously waiting for them to open the door
Hoping to score freedom for both, like I told him before
Maybe these people are the ones who've been provoking this war
So I suggested making some plans to break and advance
Since we know they've got a plot, I'm down for taking a chance
He said, ""Cool, we'll just team up together instead""
But when the wall opened he struck me in the back of the head
I fell backwards and bled, questioning what happened and scared
Wondering if the final sentence of my chapter was read
Somehow inside the room an overflow of pathogens spread
Then they snatched me from the entrance of the trap when he fled
I heard him laugh then I blacked out and woke up strapped to a bed
Noticed the guy who fought so hard not to be captured was dead
But there was something different about him, his height and his face
Neither one of us were the same size that we were in the place
I was fearing for my life but there was no one to call
When I saw the peoples whose voices I heard through it all
They were talking about the other guy and sad that he'd died
And how his body wasn't strong enough to live, though they tried
I didn't understand what went wrong, I feared as I waited
They must have done something to kill him because I saw that he made it
After he hit me I thought I would be the one to be doomed
I realised we wasn't in a room, it was really a womb
And so again the saga comes down to a cynical end
The guy that died was my brother, my identical twin
And we were both little babies, this I couldn't comprehend
Cause on the inside, somehow we saw each other as men
And as I laid there, I looked up and I saw people staring
It was a nurse some family members and one of my parents
And the struggle that we was having was to come to the Earth
But unfortunately he was sick and died in his birth
And sadly his demise helped me become what I was to be
They knew that only one would make it and somehow it was me
And even though he tried to take me out I thanked him indeed
Because I learned that unification is stronger than greed
Would he have made it if we stayed together? No one can say
But what took place on that day, no one knows it but K",https://genius.com/K-rino-escape-to-the-unknown-lyrics
When It’s Time,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"Say man, think you can out-speak us?
I'll tape your mouth shut and make you keep on throwing up until your cheeks bust
My pinnacle is where no men will go
My wins count twice bro, so after my fifth battle, I was 10 and 0
I'll blow your chest away, lowers is where is best to lay
I did everything on your career resume yesterday
Better call some help but by the time they come
You'll be ate up like a baseball team leading 9 to 1
You never made a mixtape so stop bluffing
In the rap game you're like Larry Fitzgerald cuz you don't drop nothing
Your chance to ever win will hit a dead-end
Soon as I put the thread in, instant rigor mortis begins to set in
You contemplating dissing? Better back off man
The only thing stronger then my flow is your jack-off hand
His mama told him if he lose, he better not come back in that fence
That was five years ago, this fool ain't seen his mama since
(Chorus)
When it's time to rhyme
I don't say nuttin' I just duck
Words pumping from my throat executing rappers who bonk
When it's time to rhyme
Some start ripping and others fold
I'm leaving emcees locked in a verbal submission hold
When it's time to rhyme
Suckers get nervous and try to walk
Cuz they specialize in a buncha studio talk
When it's time to rhyme
Bars hang their mics on the shelf
It's only two types of rappers, me and everybody else

That verse you said about me, you gon' pay for that
Apologizing ass like your grandma getting breast implants, too late for that
So you a constant reenactment of slackness
You gotta practice just to work your way up to wackness
I'm blowing skin patches off rappers and gon' savage
You become a statistic like an athlete scoring average
I'll should smack you just for trying that bull
He so dumb he tried to leave me a voicemail to tell me mine was full
To me it seems like you haven't been rehearsing in awhile
I'll reverse this frown on my face and curse you with a smile
I don't have to tell the people that you get worst with every style
Cuz when they hear you as a parent like a person with a child
The burden of being this great, you know you can't shoulder it
So like the dot on the lower case side, trick get over it
Another day, another verse to say, another flow to spit
Cuz like a pigeon in Alaska, trick I drop the coldest shit
(Chorus)

You on the road to destruction, I'm mapping the course for ya
If you married to the game, then I'm the divorce lawyer
I'll punch ya wit' UFC fighter beez
Step to me and I'll promise you'll get touched more then typewriter keys
Me and you? No comparing us, son
You couldn't be in the same breath as me if we was sharing along
And it ain't wise criticizing my skill
That's suicide like an Indy 500 driver that sleep at the wheel
I reveal coward rappers talking about they use gun
The only nine you ever touched was followed by two ones
My rhyme scheme are out of your most exotic dreams
Eternal, while yours go bad like month old collard greens
When I step in I'm focused, I spit dragon flame to win
No one remembers losers, by the way what was your name again?
I'm known to buss a lyrical cap, and splat your fragments on the globe
So I'll guess you can say I put you on the map

Natural Born Artist,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Those of us who fit this description are as greatly misunderstood by the masses

Sorrow comes with wisdom, pain comes with love
Could I be the true definition of... (definition of)
A natural born artist
To be yourself with somebody else which is the hardest
Light follows darkness, hate follows success
What criteria determines who's truly the best?
Ha, I'm a natural born artist (natural born artist)
C'mon

I'm not the hardest dude, I'm not the weakest either
I know that God is real, I'm not a disbeliever
Hated and misperceived, some say I'm sick indeed
Am I the one that came to save you or that wicked seed?
Outside the sun is beaming, inside my heart is raining
Still complaining despite all the blessings I'm obtaining
Temptations facilitate my tribulations
I paint pictures in your mind with verbal illustrations
You know if cash was blood I would've bled to death
I sacrifice, fed others before I fed myself
The streets are living hell, peace I've invest the fine
I'm tryna show you the way out like an exit sign
Thought I was next in line, my name was how they taught it
Sometimes you don't know you was in the moment until ya out it
 I'll give you two seconds to think about it
One, two, do you think he understood? I doubt it

Sorrow comes with wisdom, pain comes with love

Explain to me, why are we who you believe we are
Why is your perception of success perceived as law?
We chase riches with itself we outta try to master
The grass you're gazing at it might not be the greenest pasture
Happiness is something that is measured from the soul
Not how many earthly possessions that one can hold
When you die you leave with nothing so you sounding funny
And if there is a heaven they ain't up there counting money
Nothing you accumulate goes with you when it's time
Taking's impossible the key is what you leave behind
Write your thoughts down let future people read yo mind
Become eternal trees sprouted from the seeds of time
What if we take away the money, take away the car
Strip you down to the raw essence of who you are
My motives love ever drop of blood every vain
Art form perpetuation never monetary gain

Sorrow comes with wisdom, pain comes with love
Could I be the true definition of... (definition of)
A natural born artist
To be yourself with somebody else which is the hardest
Light follows darkness, hate follows success
What criteria determines who's truly the best?

C'mon

See, see your treasure might be trash to me
You might Interpret my form of worship as blasphemy
My happiness might bring you simultaneous agony
I'm glad to see anything that Allah has from me
A true artist practice his non-conformity
He constantly releases natural creative honesty subconsciously
I'm not the one the industry wants to see
Controversial not drama-free, bombed with vomit comments
'Cause they can’t stomach me
True art is scorn, creatively is torn
Contaminated and crafted out from it's natural form
An artist might cry in the sun and laugh in the storm
'Cause he operates beyond with the few to be the norm
His heart is big, so before he punishes, he warns
He celebrates the dead and mourns for the newborns
Knows he's talented but never blows his own horn
Makes a masterpiece and before receives credit he's gone

Sorrow comes with wisdom, pain comes with love
Could I be the true definition of... (definition of)

Blood on the Crown,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"All around the world, ha
Nah-nah-nah, that's what they said
Come on, bring it nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah, nah-nah-nah

Time to introduce the world to the pandemic releaser
Slide you, decline you, cut you up like a Visa
In dramatic fashion cadavers in the attic stashing
When I ring a rappers neck it look like I be cabbage patching
After the whooping I left a crook in the oven cooking
I stole my own rhyme book when I wasn't looking
I found out and the consequences were costly
You shoulda saw what I did to myself when I caught me
They say I got better after 40
Boy you 'bout to get your ass whooped like a male stripper at a bachelor party
Obsessive compulsive disorder's what it's seeming like
Repetitive torture, I start over till I think it's right
Think it's right (Think it's right), think it's right, OK now it's right
Went from South Park to Antarctica in a hour flight
These boys dirty, they done broke too many laws
Next year these rappers gon' be on stage in skinny draws

Now everybody is saying they got the top spit
Until I show up and run ‘em off of the block quick
Face down on the ground, slugs all around
Your favorite rapper was found with blood on his crown

Go find somebody weaker to dump on
I'll write a verse in 5 minutes, greater than a song you worked a month on
I won't dump on you chump unless you jump
My paragraphs are tighter than a blood pressure pump
If you don't wanna mind, I'll force you
I won't drag you across the ground, I'll drag the ground across you
Describe every tribal move, I'll do
Dial you to tell the time and place that I'll arrive to strike and still surprise you
You want a thesis from me, no problem increase the money
Promise I'm not crazy, don't believe me ask the Easter Bunny
They had me on wicked attraction for attacking rappers
I doubled back and massacred the re-enactment actors
One of my favorite things is bathing in laser beams
Waking from crazy dreams with scorpion stingers and raven wings
So come and deal with me first
After you I'll merk your kin folk, so there's no one left to print your R.I.P. shirts

Now everybody is saying they got the top spit
Until I show up and run em off of the block quick
Face down on the ground, slugs all around
Your favorite rapper was found with blood on his crown

You wrote but I wrote more, if you steal from my quote store
I'll bust through your door swinging a boat ore
I'm awfully making every image a part of me
I ought to be rewarded for verbal cinematography
I took the phrase you taught and made it abort
Like a vegetablized brain, I never gave it a thought
My payment was short, so I went and raided the vault
I just wave and it's considered aggravated assault
I got lyricists breaking while you twitching and shaking
I develop photographs before the pictures are taken
Hungry rappers stand in line when I hand bars out
I got the whole game covered like their grandma's couch
How your dome feel when my word vacuum spin it
Picture a bag on your head with a raccoon in it
No force that you could build up could make my thoughts budge
Taking dudes off the streets like a child support judge

Aaaaah, it feels so good to know how much it hurts you ha-ha",https://genius.com/K-rino-blood-on-the-crown-lyrics
Planet Exile,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"I woke up lost, disoriented and rattled
Traumatized, confused and fatigued from the travel
Had just lost a battle, now I'm light years away from free
And back on the Earth there was an imposter replacing me
But somehow I'm not afraid amazingly
I'm laying in a tub with a beautiful lady bathing me
Not even thinking about anybody saving me
Cause they treated me great, I was thinking this is the place to be!
But when I stood up the fear struck suddenly
I looked into a mirror and the person in it wasn't me
I was in another form but still myself underneath
Zapped into a new body just like Sam on 'Quantum Leap'
I started screaming, ""Get me out of this costume!""
Felt just like a claustrophobic person in a locked room
Tried to tear the skin away but that only applied wounds
Attempted to run but got apprehended by five goons
And just as sure as somebody's playing a violin
My first question to them was whose body was I in?
One of them said he must be having delusions
Induced by the news of his impending execution
Huh? Wait, hold up, did you say execution?
I'm just a few moments removed from being in Houston
Why you wanna cash my life? I'll admit the bath was nice
Found out later on she was cleaning me for the sacrifice
And after they explained and let me know the danger
Two of the arresting soldiers showed me to a holding chamber
Called me by a name I didn't recognize, claimed I jeopardized
The planet with the dangerous explosive exercise
In practicing wicked actions and tragic habits
Stealing and casting spells from forbidden magic tablets
Despite my new body I stared at the mirror surprised
The eyes of that other guy then materialized
I looked into the eyes like a crystal ball
He was causing Hell on Earth and no one could resist at all
And as I watched the fall I beat his fist against the wall
Now I know who's body I was in, I had been switched and robbed
The same guy who came to Earth and told lies
And stole my identity, was out to make my soul die
Claimed that he wanted my brain power and would grab it
But that was a lie cause I'm on this planet and I still have it
I'm thinking, ""Dag nabbit"" yet overcome with scary doubt
I'm taking the fall for every action that he carried out
If it was possible to do I would have freed myself
My chances ain't looking too good, I think I need some help
And at that moment the whole room filled with a beam
In my cell, appeared the lady who helped me kill the Machine
Unlocked my memory to make me know her face again
Then laid out the plan to help me get back to my place again
She said, ""Let's try to figure what we gotta do
To make it back is not impossible, but it's improbable
Your chances of returning are ominous
Cause based on time, the light year distance is ten trillion kilometres""
""But what about the portal that I trekked in?
Once he sent me through that door I was here in one second""
She said, ""Well, that theory, I already pre-disposed it
But when I checked the entrance to the portal he had closed it
And burned the reopening formula, every trace destroyed
Now the area you entered through is just a spatial void
So we'll need to find another way for this to end""
""Okay, but out of curiosity, how'd you get here then?""
She said, ""I'm not, it's a hallucinogenic
Transmission of holographics producing my image
I'm really in a secret lab in Houston inventing
A powerful formula that we can use when it's finished
Experimental options, I got 'em in opulence
But first you gotta give them a try to test your tolerance
Let's try to bring you back with this minute rewinder
I'll place you inside of this date finder and set the timer
And send you to the day he came and changed the facts on it
Maybe we can stop it if you land at the exact moment""
""Well if I do how can I give resistance""
""Take this universal key crystal and simply block the entrance
And keep him on the other side, to nullify his actions
If we pull it off it'll be as if this never happened""
I agreed thinking, ""Okay, what do I have to lose?""
My avenues for escape had reached dire magnitudes
""This will send you through the continuum, you can fly in this
His initial entry point's been found by my scientists
Lets test it to see how ready you are""
She blew the switch, ""K, speak to me. Oops, I sent you too far
Activate reversal mode and undo the action
Let's try something different."" ""Yeah, cause I ain't feeling that one""
Meanwhile, it was time to be taken to slaughter
I had been framed for things I never been a part of
And right before the soldiers walked up and closed in
The mystic zapped their molecular mass and froze them
Now back to work, time is wasted in this cell
It seems to me the Earth and this planet are slightly parallel
I'm thinking that this realm contains portable conditions
""Is there a way to switch both planets' orbital positions?""
She hesitated then said, ""Well yeah
But the problem is he'll still be here and you'll be still there""
""Yeah, that was stupid, okay peep, I got a scam
All you have to do is send my image as a hologram
Back to Earth in a three-dimensional way in fact
And when he sees that, he'll think somehow I made it back""
She thought about it then said, ""This is perfect""
In ten seconds my image was on the Earth's surface
He looked puzzled and nervous, pulled out a black device
Aimed it at my hologram and pushed the red button twice
The hole opened on his side and my side too
He pushed the hologram and flew right through it when he tried to
He landed in the cell with me and that's when I knew
And right before the hole closed I managed to slide through
I was like, ""Whew!"" when I saw it closing
Way out in the Universe I then heard an explosion
They had executed him at that moment
The lady came and told me, ""He's a familiar opponent""
Handed me a paper with a funny name written in ink
""RERECROS, what is this?"" She said, ""Think!""
Rerecrose? I'm wondering, did I say it wrong?
My friends and family were happy that I made it home
Back from a realm that I never again wanna be
But that night this dude's name kept haunting me
4am it hit me with the force of a meteor
I flipped the name around it said, ""SORCERER""
That's it!",https://genius.com/K-rino-planet-exile-lyrics
The Wordsmith,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"You know, man, there comes a time in every rapper’s life when he starts to run out of things to say, man, you know and I think that I’ve not reached that moment, let’s go

When I woke up this morning, it was evening
I think of things that are intriguing like a cannibal eating a vegan
Don’t take me serious, I’m only teasing
I saw my foe and got even and me being mad was the reason
See I’m a track pro and a protractor
You’re just a pro actor
So every fact you know is no factor
You name them, I will fade them
Recalculate the one hundred percent of shots I didn’t take
I still made them
Can speak on five records at once
Had lunch for dinner
Had dinner for breakfast
Then I had breakfast for lunch
Too clean for mainstream
I don’t cross t’s and dot i’s
I cross i’s and dot t’s which is really the same thing
I can record when I get bored and drop four
‘cause my essence lives ten stories above the top floor
Got a greater threat
Not even in circulation yet
I’m the information vet who made perspiration sweat

I’m the wordsmith
Let me hear you say it again
The wordsmith
I’ma kill ‘em to the end
They say nobody’s perfect
Well, I am
Dropping words like bird shit, ha
Bird shit
I’m the wordsmith
Let me hear you say it again
The wordsmith
I’ma kill ‘em to the end
They say nobody’s perfect
Well, I am
Dropping words like bird shit
Bird shit

I’m the graphic type
I’ll put twenty-four hours in half a night
Plus my rapping mic make your left leg start acting right
Straight up wipe your stomach out just to ruin your appetite
So trifling I did a mic-pass and wouldn’t pass the mic
There’s no comparison, I’m greater than this fool
I shot the school-shooter before he could make it to the school
And the gap between me and rappers is huge in disparity
You clowns are so blind you couldn’t see through transparency
I walk innocuously
Yet hold emcees hostage while doctors be watching me torture 'em and do colostomies
Had to come back as if I left the house without my keys
Devour the beat so powerfully that I make doubt believe
And you can’t move on me unless you’re a dancer
You don’t answer my questions ‘cause you know I'll question your answers
Speaking any vocab fluent
The intrinsic rare human
Plus my rap-room is also an intensive care unit

I’m the wordsmith
Let me hear you say it again
The wordsmith
I’ma kill ‘em to the end
They say nobody’s perfect
Well, I am
Dropping words like bird shit, ha
Bird shit
I’m the wordsmith
Let me hear you say it again
The wordsmith
I’ma kill ‘em to the end
They say nobody’s perfect
Well, I am
Dropping words like bird shit
Bird shit

In the eye of the storm, I’m surprisingly calm
I can wake you up every morning with a silent alarm
People wonder if I have more raps ahead
‘cause I said every single thing except everything I haven’t said
There’s no template to be the spit lord’s apprentice
So relentless if you loan me money I’ll charge you interest
Your presence I'll never have a use for it
Every truth I spit quickly produces a group of sick K-Rino duplicates
Every moment I fight to be distinct when I write
So don’t call me a great mind if they’re all thinking alike
See I’m the type who loves daylight especially at night
So intellectually precise that I’ll correct you when you’re right
Weak writers leap higher than Len Bias
When I sneak up behind 'em and fry ‘em into a pile of trembling skin fibers
I’m chasing every plagiarist
My greatness gets me so much praise that just to thank me is a 80-year waiting list

I’m the wordsmith
Let me hear you say it again
The wordsmith
I’ma kill ‘em to the end
They say nobody’s perfect
Well, I am
Dropping words like bird shit, ha
Bird shit
I’m the wordsmith
Let me hear you say it again
The wordsmith
I’ma kill ‘em to the end
They say nobody’s perfect
Well, I am
Dropping words like bird shit

Worth More Dead,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"You want fame don't you?
But chasing the majors the wrong move
It's a known rule, sign a contract, they own you
You thinking because you, give'em hits they love you
Inside of the clutches of the machine they plug you
It's more than the paper with your name on the a dotted line
Anytime that they get you to sign it's a plot in mind
They try to find naive artist and hand em
Contracts so complex only they understand em
Built to destroy ya, you can't afford a lawyer
So they offer to manage you and handle your buisness for ya
What was the price?
You thinking you covered for life
But they suckered you for your royalties and publishing rights
They got millions in hand while you living in dream land
Went platinum and only got paid 15 grand
Didn't understand that they profit whatever you speak
It's a devilish beast controlling the level you reach

They want your masters
They want your name
Now all you work to build up is gone in flames
They want your publishing and mechanical rights
And when they finish using you they want your life

The day you awaken and learn the business they panic
And blackball you because this industry is satanic
And you can't even capitalize on your fame
Cuz the paper work explains that they own your name
Your catalog was strong, now it's gone in smoke
All your blood, sweat and years, every song you wrote
Belongs to a goat worshiper whose thrones a joke
His family eats 20 generations long, you broke
They let you rise nation wide and international fast
Your assets accumulate past your actual cash
The fans love you, so you still selling out shows
You expose that they was the people and tell them 'bout those
So the momentum grows, open eyes no longer closed
A wise artist threatens their power, influence imposed
So now they know that the only road and option to go
Is to eliminate the icon and triple the dough

They want your masters
They want your name
Now all you work to build up is gone in flames
They want your publishing and mechanical rights
And when they finish using you they want your life

This ain't practice dude, never get your facts confused
Resync your relationship between blacks and jews
Manipulation of artists is a classic move
And a few material objects distracts the fool
Only a devil would scheme and not give me my green
That's why Michael Jackson called out Jimmy Iovine
His words were too extreme so they had to solve that
Mike was killed then Sony got the catalog back
The record company gets every dime that's made
And gets paid for every song every time it's played
It's a war, why you thinkin it's only coincidence
It happened to Sam Cooke, Jimi Hendrixs and Prince
Any artist with a free mind who fought for their work
Was strategically plotted on and eventually murked
When you control your art, they attack and assault
Who gunna end up with the music Prince had in his vault?
The music outlives the artist, and the truth is the truth
After they kill'em, then the record sales shoot through the roof
Digital, physical sell'in fast, with foot on the gas
Eternal cash and dead artist, K put'em on blast

They want your masters
They want your name
Now all you work to build up is gone in flames
They want your publishing and mechanical rights
And when they finish using you they want your life",https://genius.com/K-rino-worth-more-dead-lyrics
Pain and Betrayal,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"Yeah, listen to these two words
We all done experienced them at one time or another
Could be your mama, your best friend or your brother yeah

Pain is when the family ain't ate in a day or two
And you the man of the house and everybody's depending on you
Visualize your best partner taking a hit on that glass
And start stealing from you, so you end up beating his ass
Betrayal is when you give your girl, the Sun and the Moon
Then you catch her getting knocked down in your own bedroom
Picture this, your sister's prostituting handling her bis'
And you can't even tell your Daddy 'cause you don't know who he is
Little mama you bout to have a baby, ready to name it
Then the dude who help you make it, leave and don't even claim it
You and your homie catch a case for getting caught with a cake
Then in court, they show this fool talking to FED's on tape
You got a close friend you down with him, for life that's a fact
But every time you turn around, he got his knife in your back
You taking care of your seed, you ain't never been selfish
Then you find out that your only child is somebody else's

Pain and betrayal, pain and betrayal
Scarred for life by pain somebody else gave you
Constant fight to remove the stain if you able
Call on the Most High, from your brain it'll save you

Pain, is when your homie dies and no longer with ya
And you feel the sting, every time you look at his picture
A cat begged you to give him game and finally convinced ya
And then he take the nine that you gave him and use it against ya
Pain is when we start with only dreams that guide us
Then we finally do come up and let the money divide us
Betrayal is when you find out helping folks can be dangerous
And sometimes your family members do you worse than strangers
You going to church faithfully chasing your calling
But the congregation is roaching while the preacher is balling
Betrayal leads your perception of most people distorted
Pain is when your child can't have something 'cause you can't afford it
When you leave your kids but come back, much wiser and smarter
And find out they see another man as being they father
They say forgive 'cause a hard heart's pathetic and sad
I done charged so much to the game my credit is bad

Pain and betrayal, pain and betrayal
Scarred for life by pain somebody else gave you
Constant fight to remove the stain if you able
Call on the Most High, from your brain it'll save you

Pain is when your daughter or your son is molested
And guilt covers you 'cause wasn't there to contest it
When somebody else did the crime but you got arrested
And did ten years in the Pen before they finally confessed it
Betrayal, people in your presence smiling and grinning
Then talk down on you to other folks to keep you from winning
Is when a fool gets some cash and make it out of the slums
Move away and turn his back on the hood that he from
Pain, is when your husband was unfaithful and ran
And through all of that to make it worse, he slept with a man
When your wife or your little mama was being untrue
Then she tell you she'd rather be with another woman than you
Betrayal, when they told you 'bout a pie in the sky
And you discovered, that everything that you was taught was a lie
Knowing a person got potential but they won't even try
Watching the evil people prosper and the righteous die

Pain and betrayal, pain and betrayal
Scarred for life by pain somebody else gave you
Constant fight to remove the stain if you able
Call on the Most High, from your brain it'll save you",https://genius.com/K-rino-pain-and-betrayal-lyrics
Too Far,The Blood Doctrine,2008.0,"The race is not to dismiss so I run it
Money or no money, I'ma keep it 100
Life ain't easy but I can't run from it
If getting it wasn't hard, everybody would have done it
Instead of seeing the Sun, I be weathering the rain
The inner pain is something I could never explain
Whatever the game holds and my future contains
It couldn't be tougher than what I already overcame
I don't sniff no lines, commit no crimes
Pushing it to the limits still I get no shine
I'm tryna leave a legacy and hit more minds
Contemplated retirement at least four time
Got myself out from under the spell
Looked in the mirror and said, ""I gotta be the one to prevail""
Revamp the game plan, I was scared as Hell
But failing to prepare is preparing to fail
Perceptions of me are so convoluted
Got an automatic weapon and no time to shoot it
Self-analysis is so therapeutic
I done did my work now it's your turn to do it
I've been around the world in multiple time zones
Got treated like a king with 79 thrones
Styles and instrumentals I done put my rhymes on
Then I get treated like I'm nobody when I'm home
Still I keep on pursuing my high mind
There's still no point to keep riding the sideline
You ain't never paid dues, you don't know how to grind
You experience defeat and mind force nine times
But I won't hate another man's position
I gotta try to rectify my own damn condition
I can't win like a gunfighter who's handsome
 packing a gun but 

I done came too far, I done came too far
We done came too far
It's time to stand up on your own two and claim who you are
You can knock me but can't stop me
You can knock me but can't stop me
You can pop me but can't drop me
You can pop me but can't drop me

I see life differently since I'm older
My mind is messed up, my heart is colder
I had a chip, the folks acting bolder
Now I got a whole oaktree on my shoulder
Life is like rain that don't stack up
If you can't handle the pressure then pack up
It ain't about how many times you get knocked down
It's about how many times that you get back up
I'm tired of hearing grown men gasping and bitching
Put an apron on, take your ass into the kitchen
Fix a meal for me then hold my call
Since you acting like a women go wash my drawers
See, winning is a combo of mind and muscle
Overcoming the obstacles, life's a tussle
Haters and cops looking every night to bust you
Trade the game in for a righteous hustle
Life ain't all good so don't confuse it
There's somebody right now about to lose it
A dangerous fool they about to choose
Wanna be in the band but can't face the music
Nothing but negativity you going through
Gun to your own head, thinking should I do it
Had a goal in your mind but you didn't pursue it
Still living but your loaded with embalming fluid
Hold your head up high
Brother, don't you know it's all over when you die
Focus on your talent, make your money multiply
Don't you got a family to feed, this ain't no time to sit around and cry
Your life's your own car why you asking to ride
It's time to drive, get up out the passenger side
You're the first, not a clone, the best ever known
And able to do whatever you focus your mind on

I done came too far, I done came too far
We done came too far
It's time to stand up on your own two and claim who you are
You can knock me but can't stop me
You can knock me but can't stop me
You can pop me but can't drop me
You can pop me but can't drop me

I got kicked in the ass and my dreams were shattered
Was at a part when nothing really seemed to matter
My brain was all scattered, I was feeling the struggle
But I put it back together like a jigsaw puzzle
Your blessings seems to come slow as molasses
But the masses put to God, you going the fastest
I ain't tryna die in the street, just as I was trying to eat
I'd rather work 9 to 5 in the heat
You can master your domain, god so let it be
How you do ten years but can't make it into three?
Institutionalized, living in a spiritual grave
You gave and got nothing like a modern day slave
Couldn't even get a job, a felony on your back
Now you at the same dope corner, selling people crack
The game ain't never over, I'm telling you the facts
Your conscience keep on saying, ""Why the Hell you doing that""
You gonna live, die, laugh, cry
Spend they whole lifetime wondering why
Hoping on a false dream, look into the sky
Never knowing the happiness money couldn't buy
The world that made you wild, afraid to smile
Television and video games that raise your child
If your TV's broke down, rearrange your panel
When I see drama approaching I don't change the channel
Got the preacher of the poor been shouting and telling lies
While the congregation broke from paying ties
Put your faith into G-O-D and put it first
And the streets pay for the best, be prepared for the worst
Understand you can be whatever you wanna be
As a manner thicker than his heart, so is he
Get bread, take it home, divide the whole stack
When it's seems that it can't go 

I done came too far, I done came too far
We done came too far
It's time to stand up on your own two and claim who you are
You can knock me but can't stop me
You can knock me but can't stop me
You can pop me but can't drop me
You can pop me but can't drop me",https://genius.com/K-rino-too-far-lyrics
Clouds to the Ground,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"Yesterday's somebody, it can happen to you
Can be today's nobody
Never forget the process of success

I remember when he first started writing in his class
He was raw and unpolished but figured it out fast
Spitting flows for his partners had em' all tripping
Freestyling to instrumentals, in the ride flipping
Having dreams of putting his hood on the map
Females was even saying, ""Girl, he good, he can rap""
Made a low budget mixtape, did it for the love
Started hitting shows up and wrecking mics at the club
A young drug dealer saw him getting down at the spot
Said, ""Let me drop some money behind him and make it pop""
Put him in the real studio, paid for some beats
In 5 months 20,000 units sold in the streets
Now he known in the city life, getting kind of sweet
People paying him to rap and record labels tryna meet
Man this happening so fast, it don't even seem real
Went from hanging on a corner to a million dollar deal

Well its a long way down, from the clouds to the ground
From arrogant, to humble, from shallow, to profound
From the stars to the planet, your first or your last date
For fools, the top of the mountain is only half way

With no hesitation, he signed it the money had him blinded
So non-business minded he never noticed the fine print
Couldn't wait for his new master to cut the check out
First thing he did was iced his whole neck out
Couldn't wait to make it back to the hood and show out
85 thousand dollar chain on, no house
Starting to see a new life style he didn't know bout'
Women, drugs, VIP every time he go out
Hooked on that Hollywood, thoughts rearranging
His homies are his entourage, they noticing him changing
And many of them drop off, friends he was losing
The few that stayed around only did so to use him
The shows he would pack 'em, the album went platinum
Expected the first check from that one to be a fat one
No publishing was happening, deals under the table
Yeah the check was real big, not for him but the label

Well its a long way down, from the clouds to the ground
From arrogant, to humble, from shallow, to profound
From the stars to the planet, your first or your last date
For fools, the top of the mountain is only half way

Now the games different from the first day they signed him up
Plaque on his wall but the money wasn't lining up
What happened to that cat who financed his first album
The label paid him 300 grand to let them have em'
Sold into slavery, struggling for cash flow
Tryna find out why his royalty check was that low
The CEO said, ""We financed 22 things
From cars to videos, do you know what recoup means?""
Had to fall back, show money he smoked and blew all that
Tried to contact old friends, none of them called back
These was the people that was down when you was starving
Now he can't come around, his head is a target
Never gave nothing back when you was on top
Kind of sad when the phone quits ringing, the shows stop
And his next projects flop, they dropped him in a sec
Now the welfare cheque is only one he collects

Well its a long way down, from the clouds to the ground
From arrogant, to humble, from shallow, to profound
From the stars to the planet, your first or your last date
For fools, the top of the mountain is only half way",https://genius.com/K-rino-clouds-to-the-ground-lyrics
Danger Zone,Danger Zone,1995,":
I’ma have to drop me another motherfucker
Since I’m laid back I guess he think I’m a sucker
One little, two little biters, now they gone
South Park is the motherfucking Danger Zone

On the cool I hang with killers, dope dealers, ex-cap pillers
Mercenary murderous maniac mug drillers
Street thugs, crazy crews and blood spillers
Catastrophical combinations of casket fillers
Oh you cracking, cranking up all this drama
Cool, somebody go pick him up and go call his mama
’86 ‘cause I ain’t joking, I break tricks
When it comes to bullets I'm like that singing group, so come 'Take 6'
Yo, happy birthday to you
‘Cause I’m about to run revolution through you
I’m coming out to buck them like Rambo, my damn fool
I’ll slam yo ass hard ‘cause I am your worse nightmare
I might square you off solid, take the last dollar out your wallet
Peace to Louis Farrakhan and Brother Khalid
Ain’t no depressing this solid savage life decimate
Cops steady arresting this mean massacre specialist
I’m free stroking, man you think I’m joking
Out of ten next to break in I’m leaving twenty of ‘em broken
When I’m chasing ‘em, I get hyper when I’m racing them
It’s like ice cream and milk on some legs when I’m tasting them
Boom! I came out the womb to cause doom
Had to leave the Universe ‘cause there wasn’t enough room
For my brain to think, I’ma hit him with a fast shank
Let him drop, I fill him up like a gas tank

I’ma have to drop me another motherfucker
Since I’m laid back I guess he think I’m a sucker
One little, two little biters, now they gone
South Park is the motherfucking Danger Zone

I got styles sharp as the guillotine, you panic until I walk
Come witness wizardry from this killer hawk
Lyricist, K-Rino in effect, my deepness not proven yet
Teleport the heaviest objects, cause wreck while not moving yet
Stand back ‘cause I don’t feel like crushing your style today
You missed with the gun to my head but I hit you from a mile away
Lock him up in a room where struggling MCs caught him up in a breeze
Like killer bees, how the hell did he freeze, it’s damn near 130 degrees
I’m venomous like a snake but I don’t rattle like the rest of them
A silencer vocally causing explosions in the chest of them
Where’s my book? Who the hell took my book? I’ll leave them in stitches
I’ll leave them in ditches, punk-ass hoes be falling down like London Bridges
See my clique, no it’s not a game but we’ll gang up quick
See if you want to bang, throw them thangs up tricks
Let gangsters be gangsters, but we ain’t the ones
‘Cause gangsters ain’t the only people who pack the guns
See NIP got the clip, Point Blank got the shank
Cat pulled a gat, Dope-E drove a tank
Egypt E made ‘em flee, DBX broke they necks
A.C. Chill pass the drill, Ruff Eyeque got the tecks
My vocals fast, outrunning the lyrics, you stuck in the past, I hung ‘em at last
Our rap blast left him mentally trash with his tongue in a cast
I flow, ain’t nobody wrecking K-Rino
So grab your heart and tell Elizabeth you’re coming to join her, ho

I’ma have to drop me another motherfucker
Since I’m laid back I guess he think I’m a sucker
One little, two little biters, now they gone
South Park is the motherfucking Danger Zone",https://genius.com/K-rino-danger-zone-lyrics
Long Way to Go,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"While y'all looking at the hourglass
Thinking that the sand is about to run out
I'm getting prepared to flip it over and keep gon'
Come on

I wish that life came with personal instruction pamphlets
References and answers for when it gets too rough to handle it
Despite slow advancement, I managed, y'all know who I stand with
He pulled me in when I was on the cusp of major damage
My life's a puzzle, I haven't matched up all the pieces yet
It seems like something's always missing, I can never complete the set
I'm like a car with no wheels, my circumstances parked it
Plus I got a million dollar plan with no finance to spark it
We want our blessings overnight, incredible success
But God don't work for UPS or Federal Express
Better use discretion, life is an everyday test just to prove who the best
Fools hit you with set of rules that'll use to do death then move you to the left
I trip on what the world is showing me
Wow, how many killers have we passed by in our lifetimes unknowingly
Refuse to catch signs that he throwing me
Maybe I should go and see, plant a God seed and let it grow in me

I know that you think that
I'm at the end of my road
But I got a long way to go

""Me can't follow your evil tricks man""
That's like telling someone to sit calm with a man cuffed to his arm wearing a lip balm
Full of disgust plus a slave to my lust
I can't start trusting people till I meet people I can trust
Now I'm acting out of the ordinary
How can we be on the same page if we not even in the same library
Your perception of the planet is so slanted
To me your like sand, I'm concrete but you keep taking me for granted
Now the thing I want the most of all
Is who'll remain here when the posters far
And who'll stick by the closest when the flow is stalled
In frivolous things you was so involved, drugged and so enthralled
But no man can boast it all once his ghost is called
This composition was conceived in grief
Hand weaved to ease deceit from people who secretly disbelieved in me
I needed you and you needed me which meant that us needed we
But now the bridge is burned, so I'ma leave it be

I know that you think that
I'm at the end of my road
But I got a long way to go

What happens to a dream deferred?
And what purpose does it seem to serve when it's unheard and splattered against the curve?
Can you really be redeemed with words?
And murder temptations steaming urge and exercise the demon that's submerged?
It's the 4th quarter, they put me in for all to see
My life is on the line, down by nine and they keep on giving the ball to me
They got a full-court press on me I gotta break it fast
I'm tryna locate a teammate so I can make a pass
They wanna subject me to doom and harm
I scan the room in calm to the conclusion that I'm the only one in this uniform
And the entire crowd is booing me, the defense still pursuing me
Out to ruin me, they once loved me, now they through with me
I started dribbling then I shook this dummy
The ball slipped out of my hand one of them rushed over and almost took if from me
It's loud and it's a packed house
I took the shot and before I could see if I made or missed it I blacked-out

I know that you think that
I'm at the end of my road
But I got a long way to go",https://genius.com/K-rino-long-way-to-go-lyrics
Alter Ego,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"The everyday struggles started getting tough for me
Apprehension rising up in me
I found myself suddenly smothered by the tension levels that I suffered g
The heavy energy that covered me, it was a dissapointing new discovery
Not knowing what my future was to be started wishing that there was another me
Then abruptly I saw a puff of heat
Somebody started walking up to me
I cut my knee then I my smacked myself just to see if I still was asleep
I said are you the grim reaper first he chuckled then he said no luckily
He told me that he was my alter ego when I listened as he brought me up to speed
So aggravated and disgusted he
Started sayin that he's had enough of me
Said, don't you wish that you was totally sucka free, I said yes I'd love to be
He said good, now that both of us agree
Then of you I'm taking over custody
You must believe and trust indeed I won't deceive, but I questioned him reluctantly
Then he got upset and started cussing me
He said you know how theses mothafuckers be
They try to knock you off
You don't have the luxury of actin cool and uppity
I told em drama ain't my cup of tea
He said normally I deduct a fee
But I'm in here trying to hook you up for free
And destruct your opposition publicly
Okay here we go, the power building up in me slow
I'm bout to take the whole world over K-Rino with my alter ego
They thought that they had gotten rid of me so it's time to show Em how real it is When I step out into the villages I'm a show em what a real killer is
I said okay, you can finish g
He started telling what the premise be
I was shocked at how much he resembled me, then he went and pour a cup of Hennessey
And even though we thought differently, cause of his many sinister tendencies
His ideologies would interest me eventually developing the chemistry
I sat listenin attentively, is all about about self dependency, said he can do the work of ten of me, bringing world dominance potentially, he said you got the right energy, you just execute it too timidly, but with me we can instantly blow em all out of the vicinity
The time is up for being friendly
Gotta let em see a new identity
And pimp slap every fake ass devil worshiper that's in the industry
And then if they got a problem with it, bomb on em make them pay a penalty, kill em lyrically religiously, academically if need be physically, the next generation's simply is getting massacred and raped mentally, consistently even grown Men and women be mimicking his imagery, I said hell yeah let's get it in homicide is the remedy, now I'm finna be 23 times worse, everybody is a enemy
I ventured out into society, steppin loud not quietly, defiantly walking through the streets with a killer entity inside of me, had taking over me entirely, and I knew that there was no denying me, I chopped the head off the first rapper that was dumb enough to cut his eye at me
Instead of sadness and crying, we found it funnier than Richard Prior be, 
My alter ego is watching me as I cut his body down like I tree
He said that it was done justifiably, I smiled and said, yeah I agree
The killer urging me to fry emcees grew violently and maniacally
And every night I read silently
Cause if I would speak loud I would bleed
Now any where I'm at a riot be
At first I was too shy to see
I do it just to stop my anxiety
Never for the note of rioting
And when I'm done what a liar he never functions again viably
And even though I murder tribally
Still I maintain high piety?, he said, I think you get it now, I'm a about to leave, then he said bye to me
He said I know you hated this experience, then we laughed at the irony, ha",https://genius.com/K-rino-alter-ego-lyrics

Yeah, what's up homie I see ya
This for you boy, love you mayn
You already know that, check it
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-da-da
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-da-da, la-la-la, la-la

A.C. god rest his soul, lost him at 36 years old
I miss my boy and how we use to roll, life is good but sometimes it's cold
Same old story written in stone, we never honor people until they gone
The night you called it never crossed my mind, that I was hearing your voice for the very last time
Man since then I been wishing, to see you roll up in that Expedition
Saying some'ing funny breaking me up, or knocking on my window waking me up
I use to get mad when you did that then, now I'd pay to have you do it again
People you just met you let em in close, I felt like I knew you better than most
So when I see and hear things each day, I picture you there and I know what you say
Yeah A.C. would of laughed at that, I hope you know that I had your back
The times we argued and almost scrapped, killing emcees way back in the gap
We was partnas though music put us on the map, we're ninety percent friends and ten percent rap
When one was hungry the other one fed, when I struggled you gave me a job and break bread
Back in the days we would mob to the club, you introduced me to the woman I love
Man I wanna grab them throwback years, when I talk about ya I gotta hold back tears
I got your family that's my obligation, if they need me I'm right there no hesitation

You never know, when life will end
It's always hard, to lose a friend
Sometimes you lose, sometimes you win
I know one day, we'll meet again

I know you did what you had to do, but it's like myself inside is mad at you
We still got a whole lot of songs to rip, a whole lot mo' microphones to grip
I hear you on records spitting your name, or talking trash playing a video game
Always thinking of ways to get ahead, then I picture you laying in that hospital bed
I try to talk to you and bring you back, hoping some'ing I say would make you react
Daily I pray to the Lord that way, December the 14th it rained hard that day
You left the world and it was probably extreme, I know I'm tripping it's gotta be a dream
I'mma wake up walk out hop in your ride, and say man I had a crazy dream that you died
Then you'd laugh and hit the streets, hoop at the park grab some'ing to eat
Chill and talk about rhyming skill, but this ain't no dream this time it's real
I hate to stress but some nights I do, when your mama called it was like I knew
A close friend is hard to lose, I had to call everybody up and break the news
During the funeral my mind was sound, but I broke down hard at the burial ground
When reality hit tears ran like water, I thought of your son and felt for your daughter
Some days it's hard to fight, but death really is a part of life
If we keep his name alive he'll live through us, he was never ours God loaned to us


When it was time to leave you was always slow, when boys were rapping you would always flow
Shoot pool and leave with all they do', and I'mma make sho' people always know
We ain't gon quit putting it down in the game, A.C. wouldn't want us to stop doing our thang
His job is done his time is given, the day of the gone we need to mourn for the living
Sometimes I restrain myself, trying to imagine the pain you felt
Death was some'ing I never assumed, that night we took you to the emergency room
Your daughter's mother passed away and she gone, your son's mother gotta raise him alone
But your legacy is engraved in this song, I still got your house number saved in my phone
Guess what the division does, I never even knew what your religion was
I guess it don't matter, cause anytime you could help giving love is what your decision was
I'm at home watching basketball, a couple of times man I almost called
We gave females a lot of tension, pulled a few stunts that I ain't gon mention
Now you gone away, down a road that we all gon walk one day
You live on cause you had two kids, and now that you gone homie I'm glad you did
The crew dealing with it in they own way, but right now I can only speak for K
This song I hate I had to write, but you wrote the words just by living your life yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-you-never-know-lyrics

This is for you, suckers

This dimension is psychotic, no chance to escape
I psychopathically summon visions of vehicles being raped
Quick to daze ya. If that don't faze ya
I'mma travel back through time; then I'mma spiritually re-raise ya
Mirror reflecting horrible sculptures
Of planets disappearing and reappearing in other cultures
Demonic air pollutes 
Projecting visions of dead bodies with living split wigs
Evil cuts from six, with the sight sound
Every man is a twix
Women and children get 
So much destruction I changed my views

Acid, hurricane, rain, heavy screams from pressure, pain
Pistol is punishment prosecuting your first name
Ganksta NIP is a curse
Psychotic demon, I'm imprisoned in this universe

Better hope that you die cause if you live it gets worse (kick)

Life is a jail I've been trapped by the powers
But mentally I served twenty years in three hours
First I lyrically fought ya then lyrically brought ya to death
Electrocution Chinese Water Torture truth
Nobody's deeper than K-Rino it's true
To think about me for a minute takes a month and a half to do

Cracked a rapper so bad I made his shadow wanna follow me
So go buy a pen. You'll lose if you try and win
I'll die, resurrect, die and resurrect and die again

Heaven On Earth (H.O.E.),The Hit List,2004.0,"They say a woman is a H.O.E., I hear you, G
If them initials stand for Heaven on Earth, then I'll agree
They say a woman means H.O.E., that's cool with me
If them initials stand for Heaven on Earth, then I'll agree

Straight from God, a gift to bring calm to the storm
Soft and warm female, Heaven in human form
Black queen, her touch is like energy from the Sun
Can't imagine life without her 'cause it wouldn't be none
My respect for you seems to increase with time
Blessed to find one who gives me constant piece of mind
Stress free which lets me overcome struggle and grief
A sacred specimen creation beyond belief
Her beautiful conversations like songs from a bird
Hidden power deep enough to move mountains with a word
React as if I ain't seen black women in days
I'm overpowered and phased by sweet feminine ways
Darkness come I find you bring light to the mind
Memories of you rewind time, give sight to the blind
Keeping learning about each other it remain new and fresh
Let our souls merge together till we transcend the flesh

It's like Heaven on Earth when you're around
After all the things we been through we still down
You show love for me (love for me), even when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong

Ready to face whatever God plans to stay together
God leading the way so we ain't scared to pray together
Whatever you're past holding baby, never mind that
Let's take the word relationship and redefine that
Never ever disrespect her, that's the ultimate rule
To curse a woman is to curse your own existence fool
It don't matter if she yell or caramel pitch black
I be feeling what you thinking just through eye contact
Able to take a man, civilized him when he was wild
And reproduce a copy of him in the form of his child
Your like the Sun in the daytime and the Moon at night
Universal life, I see you and my thoughts take flight
And if it's real we gon' step it up when trouble appears
And every second that we spend apart gon' seem like years
My life is gon' be judged by the way that I treat ya
Let’s start over boo, my name is K-Rino, it's nice to meet ya
Like Heaven

It's like Heaven on Earth when you're around
After all the things we been through we still down
You show love for me (love for me), even when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong

Your life story got to be one developed in stages
Y'all can't write the same book if you on 2 different pages
Understand, it ain't about material stuff
If you don't stimulate her mind then the world ain't enough
She down to earth but if I’m in the wrong, quick to get brave
Knowing how to be submissive without being a slave
The consolation that I'm needing when she feeding my soul
Cast my words into the Universe and let 'em unfold
Anything I'm tryna get done, she ready to roll
The most beautiful vision two eyes could ever behold
Knowing she will be the one from the second we meet
I strive to elevate and place the Universe at her feet
Every day is mother’s day so don't ever forget it
Tryna keep it real and do better by staying committed
From body, soul to mind she divine by design
Just to keep her safe, I'm down to place my life on the line

It's like Heaven on Earth when you're around
After all the things we been through we still down
You show love for me (love for me), even when I'm wrong
You give me so much in my life you keep me strong

Girl, you know you're like Heaven, Heaven, Heaven...
The things you do for me to satisfy me baby baby",https://genius.com/K-rino-heaven-on-earth-hoe-lyrics
All I Went Through,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"Most of what I did in life came from a place of love
Long before I had understanding of what a hater was
Took some hits, glad I went through it ‘cause that’s the way you learn
Funny how those mentalities change up when the tables turn
Said they ridin’ with ya, but they treat you like a crash dummy
Said they ridin’ with ya, but ain’t pitchin’ in no gas money
Rappin’ in the school bathrooms, knew I was meant for this
Never forget the ones who was laughin’ and wasn’t interested
Same ones, now when I come across ‘em, they fans now
Same ones asking for pictures, shaking my hands now
What if I’da forsaken my notebook, man, and put it up
What if I’da listened when they told me I wasn’t good enough
Every now and then inside my mind, AC Chill appears
Always wonder what would he be doing if he still was here
Probably would be still killing mics and having fun
Guess it’s better losing a homie than never having one

So when I think of all I went through
And then I think of all I been through
I use it to make me better and then grew
Now I know each and every part I was meant to, meant to

A lot of trauma from the distant past oppressed in my internal
Thinkin’ of the pain inflicted got me heated like a thermal
Spending everyday silently tryna heal from all the wars
They ain’t got enough bandaids to cover all the scars
Used to talk to chicks and not get told the right digits
I’ve been taken advantage of and walked over like bridges
It took me a minute to properly read the procedure
That when people no longer can bleed ya, they no longer need ya
I still check myself and thank god whenever it’s hard
I know how it feels to be hungry but never to starve
You gotta study everybody and have thick outer skin
I discovered that even losers can teach you how to win
It’s tough to think about the bread I let myself run through
Looking for ways to blame others for my own dumb moves
It’s no one formula, it’s many reasons why you can fail
Not being honest with yourself the biggest lie you can tell

So when I think of all I went through
And then I think of all I been through
I use it to make me better and then grew
Now I know each and every part I was meant to, meant to

What you did in the past doesn’t have to be your life’s definition
When I look at people, I see them and not their condition
Stop telling people to let it go just ‘cause it’s old
It’s easy to clean the body, tough to clean out the soul
Might be dealing with things that happened to ‘em at a young age
Problems from back in the days resurface in other ways
Then we misunderstand that person’s sadness or rage
‘cause we don’t know the history of how they got to that stage
Don’t just look at what you think you see, the root of it’s bigger
Any reactions people give off have a reason to trigger
You might not have been the one to cause that person’s pain
But since you right there at the moment, you’re the one that gets blamed
Understand prior circumstances that they went through
And recognize that they had a past before they met you
And not all of the hurt affects you but the rest of it does
Took me a while to realize how sick and messed up I was

So when I think of all I went through
And then I think of all I been through
I use it to make me better and then grew
Now I know each and every part I was meant to, meant to",https://genius.com/K-rino-all-i-went-through-lyrics
Lyrical Grind,The Hit List,2004,"It's our time to shine and make a million
We are the ones that bump and grind all day
So, we're ghetto children

I come so hard, they put a straitjacket on my tongue
Bust flows with handcuffs on my lungs
Didn't have a gun, but the blast still stung
Didn't have a rope, but his ass still hung
Living in the ghetto, no time to smile
Laws and player haters, get placed in one pile
By the time they realized, they legs were chopped off
My foes, had already ran 21 miles
When it's time to hit the streets, I ain't got no friend
We're all living in sin, multiplied by ten
Down to spit a word at the speed of the wind
And never be ashamed to tell you hoes I punched in
You came to the table ready to throw quick
Wanna see how aggravated my lyrical flow get
Got jacked looking for a new target to go hit
(You be rapping your ass off K), no shit
I see I gotta be the one, to let the world know
Just because your words rhyme don't mean you got flow
Y'all don't wanna run up on K and Z-Ro
We was writing on your level at the age of 4
Ain't saying a damn thang talking loud
Flows weaker than water still acting proud
Every wack ass show you throw, you got mo'
Motherfuckers on stage than it is in the crowd
On top challengers, I can face those, the coldest in the game, no doubt we rape flows
Can you create, tight shit without having to smoke some weed first, oh you can't case closed
I'ma take the game, to levels you never seen
Teach you bout delivering, lyrics you never mean
Pushing a perpendicular, paragraphs of punishment
Mutilating the Devil, and stinging him till you scream
Quick to make a lick, then handle the ends
Putting tricks to bed, when I'm rattling chins
Strangle, hitting from a psychological angle
Back door him 'til he feel like he battling twins
Been in the game since 1984
Love the underground, fuck the radio
Need a billion dollars 'fore I leave out the do'
So devils and fake partners, so long they gotta go

It's our time to shine and make a million
We are the ones that bump and grind all day
So, we're ghetto children

Staying on the grind, all the day long
Puffing on a sack, until all the hate gone
Steady running, through my veins
I gotta go and get a pocket full of change, hustling before all the day gone
I been pimping a pen but, probably fluctuation in the nation
Of poverty, stricken people
So everybody, trying to get a piece of the pie
But the pie for white people, in the land of evil
Me myself, I'm a goodfella
Raining on a hater parade, grab an umbrella
Catch you at the light, catch you at the ATM teller
Young fella, at his last hour
Caught up, in a non sugar coated shower
Raw damaging, motherfuckers ain't managing
To get away, from my beam
Leave a nigga not standing when, I shoot him and stab him
Can't get away, from my team
Ain't nothing but killers and drug dealers, and blood spillers in one spot
Eagle talons hollow points, and regulars in one Glock
Take it out, it take one cock
Take over the whole city, but begin with one block
It's a promise, of paper will put a pimp plump out a pocket side
Motherfucker I'm willing to kill, and willing to die
Any nigga willing to try, cause I don't bar nothing
Leaving son of a bitches, in stitches
For my riches, cause I'm paid in cash
Running up on em, where the wet marijuana square
Fried out, who's gonna save his ass
Sick cause I don't like busting a men, I gotta get my grub on
So my family, can get they grub on
And when we grubbing, it's a family affair
Gotta get enough grub, for everybody to grub on
Everyday all day, on a mission to make that money
Gotta get that pay, K dash Rizino and Z-Riggy-Riggy Ro
Gon get our share, and fuck ass and for
We taking it, leaving bald spots in they hair
Life is hard, but it's fair

It's our time to shine and make a million
We are the ones that bump and grind all days so we're ghetto children

Penitentiary chances, taken
We're risking our own lives
But now, we pimp a pen all day collecting G's

It's our time to shine and make a million
We are the ones that bump and grind all day so we're ghetto children

Penitentiary chances taken
We're risking our own lives

The Glasses,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"This young guy was 24 years old, maybe 25
And had been used and broken many ties in the time he’d been alive
His heart since the beginning was compassionate and generous
But then it just got dark when he saw people were so venomous
His faith was damaged, used to believe he could save the planet
But the fake would manage always to damage and take advantage
Of his kindness and although he now seen the world was fiendish
He dreamed about a means to screen people and distinguish
So one night as he took a walk, his stress had reached its summit
He saw a bag that had a bright light emanating from it
His first response was to ignore it and keep walking past it
Instead he grabbed and opened it up and found a pair of glasses
Assuming someone lost ‘em, he nearly choked with surprise
‘Cause he couldn’t resist the strong urge to place 'em over his eyes
And as other people walked by, his insight became strong
‘Cause he now could see through people’s hearts each time he had ‘em on

With these glasses, he could see inside the conscience of the masses
And pinpoint all the madness with exactness
What he thought would bring him happiness brought sadness
These glasses
These glasses, he could see inside the conscience of the masses
And pinpoint all the madness with exactness
What he thought would bring him happiness brought sadness
These glasses

So then he was astounded ‘cause now he walked around with
The ability to read hearts, by chance he finally found it
The evil and detestable, deceitful and unethical
Were all detectable as long as he had donned these spectacles
He found people and tried ‘em and every liar spiteful thought inside him
There was no disguise a fake smile that could hide him
And with this strange invention, before a word is ever even mentioned
He could look at you and tell you your intentions
He knew who hated and who loved, family, friends, it mattered not who you was
Before you spoke it he knew what the truth was
It shielded him from danger and half the time no person was a stranger
Those who tried him became victims of his anger
Now his own mind he was losing, emotionally it moved him
Seeing collusion in the minds of loved ones who were out to use him
It confused him ‘cause even though this is what he desired
The knowledge of private internal sheistiness made him tired

With these glasses, he could see inside the conscience of the masses
And pinpoint all the madness with exactness
What he thought would bring him happiness brought sadness
These glasses
These glasses, he could see inside the conscience of the masses
And pinpoint all the madness with exactness
What he thought would bring him happiness brought sadness
These glasses

Now he walked the city frantic
And those who looked like normal folks he glanced at
And saw that they were sick, perverse and rancid
He felt like he was wrong, he started to take ‘em off
But he’d succumbed to a compulsive desire to keep ‘em on
So he freaked out on a whim and his hope for all humanity was slim
So he started to pass judgement and condemn
And the power of the glasses overtook him
It shook him to his core so he decided to kill each person after lookin’
With this self-controlled delinquent, he approached an older lady and without blinkin’
She started telling him what he was thinking
He was baffled, she grabbed him and said, “I don’t mean to scare you
But those glasses that you’re wearing, though they’re rare, I have a pair too
But you were disobedient, abused the seeing power and got deviant
But me I only used ‘em when I needed it
So this privilege you’ve lost it
So even if you take ‘em off, your view of people and their view of you will be distorted...""

With these glasses, he could see inside the conscience of the masses
And pinpoint all the madness with exactness
What he thought would bring him happiness brought sadness
These glasses
These glasses
He could see inside the conscience of the masses
And pinpoint all the madness with exactness
What he thought would bring him happiness brought sadness
These glasses",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-glasses-lyrics
Kill The Preacher,Time Traveler,2005.0,"Feel me
From the first second the devil started breathing
He would breed a high degree of deceiving  man believed in
Seething with satanic reasoning
Theological bobbing and weaving left the masses grieving cause justice was uneven
The Bible is considered to be unequivocally words literally derivative of Gods Mind and Man spiritually
But what you vision the scripture to be ain't the actual picture you see
What was given to thee ain't how it was written originally
Now listen to me, this whole is true in any mans nation
The Bible has many versions and many translations
European scholars took the manuscripts and reshaped em
Draped them in false hood, took the holy scripts and raped them
Then they fed it to the people in ways their minds couldn't distinguish
Altered the book to make it suit them when translating it to English
And proof of the lies is in the King James before your eyes the first page states
""Former translations have been compared and revised""
And the word ""Revise"" simply means ""Change""
Certain parts rearranged, by a special command of a devil named King James
66 books this version contains and not the only ones in the game there was more but from putting those in they refrain
This fact is mostly unknown
You hope I'm wrong but how come 73 books in the Bible and 6 in the home with the pope in Rome?
The truth came but we missed it I got it twisted
There were multiple Bibles listed before the King James existed
Kill the preacher, the falsehood, murder em dead
The intentional lie teacher, off with his head
When they empty out that garbage, fill em with proof
When they attack you with deception, kill em with truth
Kill the preacher, no matter where you see em'
Transport his physical being from the pool pit to the mausoleum
With his concept of God I'm disagreeing
The image of the Black Messiah Jesus being depicted as European
Feel me, you thought he was but he wasn't
The face you worship as Christ, is actually Michelangelo's cousin
I speak plain, hoping you find what you seek mane
Know that the word Jesus ain't African dude that's a Greek name
This is serious, most ignorant, congregations are hearing it
The Babylonian covers a six thousand year period
I'll pick now and start, chronologically descending
From us to Jesus, Jesus to Moses, Moses to the beginning
And those exist in 2 thousand year increments
We take the devils teachings in, but we never even think of it
And the same demon that tricked the whole world and gave you yours
Was a savage in a caucus mountain walking around in all fours
The Pastors a magician, the choir leader is a faggot
Murder em' all from Billy Graham, down to Jimmy Swaggart
The black ones, the white ones that's practicing satanism
The holidays ain't nothing but worshipping paganism
It don't matter what we follow, we in murdering range
If all we do is quote scriptures but ain't helping nobody change
God don't author no confusion, but we get played consistently
You wanna show a man his true religion, teach em' his history",https://genius.com/K-rino-kill-the-preacher-lyrics
Breathing In Untapped Regions,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"When I compose sentences, my sole emphasis is to be so intricate
That when you listen you know it is in hopes of coincidence
I refocus and implement three doses of infinite penmanship
Sent to me through osmosis like incidence
I see through every chest plate with a singular x-ray
You hear me wreck way before your fingers can press play
They clingin’ to K because I bring it the best way
Went from freshman to being a senior the next day
I conceive a crisis if you say that he’s the nicest
Siphon oxygen from evil pirates then start increasing the breathing prices
Not evil ISIS frightens people like this
Unseeable paramecium types with bites that cut you into pizza slices
Recite ’til I get encephalitis, bring death to reckless writers
And where I left them I’ll act like I helped a psychic decipher it
My enunciation might seem blunt
I scheme stunts like stretching one year to thirteen months

Breathing in the untapped regions
Reading while I’m sweeping out these dumb rap heathens
Listen as the literary gun-clap bleeds him
In another city is where one slap leaves him
K-Rino’s breathing in the untapped regions
Reading while I’m sweeping out these dumb rap heathens
Listen as the literary gun-clap bleeds him
In another city is where one slap leaves him

I’ve contaminated lungs with my animated songs
I could read your palms if you had two amputated arms
I’m performin’ slicker, abnormally calm inflicter
Conceived one night and born the next morning
With a lipped tongue and a warning sticker
I launch indecent responses, back hand sweep with a gauntlet
So at peace I can go to sleep while I’m conscious
The speech homicides reap ominous beats I tongue kiss
For each one I don a pen and blank sheets my accomplice
The invisible visitor
What I see in a mirror’s a mastermind accessory killer and co-conspirator
Virulent trivia, spirit inhibitor, a clip deliverer
Contributor to whatever helps me get rid of ya
I’m revolvin’ in space at a marvelous pace
Able to beat you in a race if I was jogging in place
Before you committed the crime, I was solving the case
Laughing hysterically while still looking hard in the face

Breathing in the untapped regions
Reading while I’m sweeping out these dumb rap heathens
Listen as the literary gun-clap bleeds him
In another city is where one slap leaves him
K-Rino’s breathing in the untapped regions
Reading while I’m sweeping out these dumb rap heathens
Listen as the literary gun-clap bleeds him
In another city is where one slap leaves him

Aggressively I’m addressing and blessing the mic in question
To the average peasant even my mess-ups look like perfection
Wire my jaw shut, staple and tape up my mouth phrases
With rakes straight through my trachea, escape and get out
With no love, contemptuous scrubs get drugged up the gamut
I don’t drop the mic, I pick the whole club up and slam it
K has got an accelerated working rate
So even when I watch TV, I created eight verses every commercial break
With the profundity amount my brain got, I can watch a thunderstorm, namin’ county’s raindrop
I’m weaving through his preventive defense with a 3 minute sequence
Burning one of my sheets, breeze twenty reprints
The way I draft classics so immaculately
Is only equalled by your accurate inaccuracy
Nonexistent beings I see them, from the prelim I can read them
While secretly sliding in an alien woman’s DMs

Breathing in the untapped regions
Reading while I’m sweeping out these dumb rap heathens
Listen as the literary gun-clap bleeds him
In another city is where one slap leaves him
K-Rino’s breathing in the untapped regions
Reading while I’m sweeping out these dumb rap heathens
Listen as the literary gun-clap bleeds him
In another city is where one slap leaves him",https://genius.com/K-rino-breathing-in-untapped-regions-lyrics
Try,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Man
Why would you... not even give a effort?
Let me tell you sumthin' man
Listen
Everybody wants to live
Looking for some love to give
You don't have to feel no shame
Cause everybody goes through pain
You just gotta live your life
Keep pushing till you make things right
Sometimes you think that love's not real
I promise I know how you feel
If you just believe in you
Others in your life will too
After doing all that you can do
Remember every day is brand new
Never let em steal your shine
Be patience until your time
You can have whatever's in your mind
All you got to do is try
Try
Try (you can do it man)
Don't waste time wondering why
Why
Try (you can do it girl)
Get up
Sometimes people make it seem
Like you can never reach your dreams
The negativity they bring
Perfects you from achieving great things
Why would you ever let them in?
They don't wanna see you win
They try to make you lose control
Get up and focus on your goal
If you just believe in you
I know that God'll see you through
But only if you feel it's true
Remember every day is brand new
The road that you was on got rough
So then you wanted to give up
Too many waste of years gone by
Because you was afraid to try
Try
Try (you can do it man)
Don't waste time wondering why
Why
Try (you can do it girl)

Ha, don't settle for getting by
The only thing that's impossible is the thing you don't try
It's too factual to deny
The only thing that's impossible is the thing you don't try

The only thing that's impossible is the thing you don't try

It’s gettin’ heavier as I’m older

Please forgive me (‘give me), I just want the world to feel me (feel me)

Murder music is what I call it, I spit for the block
A Latin emcee with a sprinkle of Biggie and Pac

And rise against the evil machine, like it’s a fashion
And fight against the powers that be
I ain’t bowing down to no man, only master is me, don’t you agree?

I’m a dangerous monsoon, you just a water balloon
Need to stop tryna take us ‘cause you not gon’ win it
Just to show us the White House bathroom got a hot comb in it
For years we represented, smacked the faces of tricks
Blood sport pillow fight, pillowcase full of bricks
You’ll probably steal it first on May 27th then fool your clique
And for the record, it was written on May 26th
That was quick, it’s all gravy, I’m piloting aircrafts and
Drafting paragraphs, elevated my multitasking
We drop concepts that captivate and grab ‘em
By the time you lay one verse, we recorded a whole album
Two or three projects, man, that’s a week’s worth
You gettin’ weighed down by the  that’s on your t-shirt, foo’

You ain't out here trying to get it and build something
Why are you even alive?
Let's get our weight up
Ah ha
Yeah listen
I got it get it so I'm flexin' 'till my arm lock
Waking up automatically with no alarm clock
Money is the mission I ain't tryin to take an L man
Bills so heavy got me wantin' to whoop with the mailman
Nothing in the world like eating when you want to
Never waste time talkin' bout' what you gon' do
Sittin' back whining and complaining that's the lame way
Come up with a plan and start working it the same day
Never tell haters bout' your ideas and thoughts homie
All they goin' to do is criticize and throw salt on it
If I got a chance to make somethin' can't pass it up
Keep making deposits till the bank tells me that's enough
Stayin' smart cause the game ain't what it seem mane
I ain't chasin' women but I'm chasing them green thangs
Can't be broke, I'm trying to live like a king mane
In the kitchen naked makin breakfast like ?
Everyday when I wake up
I be tryin' to get my weight up
Going wherever the hustle takes us
We built for it so it can't break us
Who me? Stop cakin' boy you must be crazy
You ain't broke cause you dumb you broke cause you lazy
I'm a Hood fella coming up hard made me
Benefiting from the gift that the good Lord gave me
Be smart when you get it use your brain with it
Never let nobody tell you that you can't get it
You hit a lick in you was flat broke the same minute
All he had was 50 G's and bought a chain with it
C'mon mane, you want to be rich?
You gotta vision it
Quit blowing your money by property open businesses
You don't want to be sitting here years from now ticked off
Thinkin' 'bout all the money that you done tricked off
Been there, done that, promise I ain't feelin' that
Some have a lost millions in the game and can't get it back
Even when I'm sleeping my wheels turning at all times
Sneezing in your face cause I am allergic to small minds
Everyday when I wake up
I be tryin' to get my weight up
Going wherever the hustle takes us
We built for it so it can't break us
You wanna build something real gotta have persistence
Being wealthy or rich?
You better learn the difference
You got a box in your closet with three or four g's
He got a company with 2000 employees
I'm trying to be a true boss not an imitation
I want something that'll last 10 generations
Plus a woman that all grind to the finish line
Nothing like having a chick with a business mine
All these clowns get some money then they leave the hood
Instead of bringing their paper back to feed the hood
Some think too small and never reach their peak
I'm trying to conquer the world you trying to claim a street
What kind of work are you gon' leave behind when you gone?
People goin' to cry for 'bout a week then they moving on
All you did in life was go to work and come back home
I am in this get this money zone
So...
Everyday when I wake up
I be tryin' to get my weight up

Fall Down,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Secretly what do you think of me?
When I'm not around how do you speak of me do evil thoughts travel your frequency?
Moral delinquency eats and sleeps with me
Meaning my heart is good though I'm not the leading model of decency
Despite with my previous achievements be I still find that increasingly
Hard for even myself to believe in me
Not many people are as deep as me
Yet still it seem to be the fees are not being redistributed evenly
Somewhere down the line there's been some thievery
And it's not all monetary grand deceivers have lied and socially cheated me
The way the world has previously treated me
Leads me to seeing the grievous truth that we haven't been seated equally
So, with all that being said I'll just look ahead
And won't ever criticize a cover until that book is read
And showing love since my baby in the crib stage
Keeping true and never lead your side like your ribcage
But...

The jealous wanna see me fall down
But if I do I'm a get back up and knock em all down
The jealous wanna see me fall down
I know they jealous of me, them boys is jealous of me
Them haters jealous of me, them fools is jealous of me

As soon as you come up on something everybody's quick to grab
You the one who caused the wound and now you wanna pick the scab
Stressful thoughts in my folder and now I gotta hit the lab
We all sit at the table, ate and y'all won't even split the tab
I know if I let you, you would bleed me till the end of time
You keep thinking money is not an object cause you spending mine
If the shoe was on the other foot, you wouldn't lend a dime
Sometimes they apologize, but it's never genuine (Ginuwine)
They say never question God trust in him he understands us
But I disagree whose better qualify to give you answers
Faith without works is dead but closed mouths won't get fed
God helps those who helps themselves and lazy hustlers don't get bread
Everybody wanna speak on what they had or got today
But sometimes during life is best to know what not to say
Everybody knows somebody hooked on drugs or locked away
So why you wanna gossip, disrespect, slander and propagate


No time for negative vibes I changed my life and woke up
You was happy when you heard me and my wife had broke up
You can hate I learn to master and survive problems
My autobiography ought to be twenty-five volumes
Understand nothing that exist today stays the same
The only thing in this life that's constant is change
I smash the weak, like a message I delete
Cause the fake smiles disguised as the presence of deceit
Envious people gon talk so let em scream and shout it
Nothing you can do to change it so why about it?
Strategically defeat your foes but do it cleverly
The jealously is cause of things in you that they can never be
So don't be mad we goin laugh and have a celebration
Throw a hater party and send all of em an invitation
Around the world, cause it don't matter where they from
But you know that they some haters so they probably ain't goin come

Negativity,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Negativity around me in family and so-called friends
(This what we go through)
Livin' in a world where they rather see you lose than win
(Yeah, feel it)
They wanna bring me down but I beat 'em time and time again
(Yeah, this is what we go through)
No matter how the try I'ma still get my ends
(Check it out)

Don't judge me 'til you walk in my shoes and travel my path
Y'all laugh but do the math on the cadavers when I unravel my wrath
I match aggression from the starting gate to the closing of it
And leave my foes froze, eyes looking upward 'cause I rose above it
People try to cheat the grind, fake hustlers with weakened minds
Too lazy to pick the signs, but fool you gotta seek to find
You got business, handle yours, ain't no time to speak on mine
Gotta mash to keep from dyin', gotta laugh to keep from cryin'
We getting tangled in that political game disguised in a spiritual name
Pivotal moves that lead us straight to the flame
Material gain can't sustain on a metaphysical plane
I'd rather brag about my brain than a hundred-thousand dollar chain
We're conditioned and scarred, so tryna provoke us ain't hard
They flash down to their cars at us to take our focus off God
All awhile, we facin' pain. it's turnin' sons against mothers
One day they be brothers then the next day put their guns on each other

Negativity around me in family and so-called friends

I was taught at an early age you can't make everybody happy
The person I show the most love'll be the main one tryna cap me
False teachings in the weave, preach a word that you believe
But I'm harder than water when it reaches 32 degrees
What's an enemy? A woman, a man with a strong reflection of energy channeled in the wrong direction
Bring a static like a bad phone connection
I scare at critiques with enigmas the leave America twisted
Cannibalistic men with parasitic characteristics
Start lies that rise like a 1990 Jordan flies
No time for the unwise wicked unorganized
I got stacks to earn, stories and scientifical fact to learn
Tracks to burn, you give hate it comes back to you like a tax return
Maximum acts of black homicides under your sleeve
(Why did he kill his girlfriend?) 'Cause she told him she wanted to leave
Institutionalize, they beat us and never apologize
I see the big picture, the one you lookin' at is wallet size

Negativity around me in family and so-called friends
(This what we go through)
Livin' in a world where they rather see you lose than win

Long as you know, I ain't got time to push or shove with you bro
How can you claim to be a pimp when you're in love with your ho
See that's a conflict of interests
It's like wearing a fur coat when the Sun gets relentless, contradiction of one's business
I squab alone, revolve around killers that's hard as stone
People talkin' about your problems when they can't even solve their own
Intoxicated or sober, I just shoot 'em the cold shoulder
And please don't believe the hype 'cause partners will mess you over
See I can't stand to hear someone that's always complaining
It's too hot in the summertime and it's too wet when it's raining
I don't trip on negativity 'cause I'm elbowing scrubs
For everyone that's talking bad and sick the more they're showing love
I'm tryin' to get crams and withstand your under-handed plan
(I got deep as flash hit, I can go zone a man to man?)
I catch hate and wipe it right off when it lands on me
Run your mouth for 20 years but just don't put your hands on me",https://genius.com/K-rino-negativity-lyrics
What You Don’t Say,The Maven,2013.0,"Man, you know what?
I don't care how real you say you are, man
It's like, everybody beef
Certain things you just don't say
You be wantin' to say it
But you don't say it
And everybody do it
That don't mean it ain't no love, it just mean that
Sometime you just don't say it
I'mma show you what I'm talkin' bout
I'mma show you what I'm talkin' bout
I'mma show you
Watch it!

I'm in the supermarket, no money to dine out
A child throwing a tantrum, and his momma screamin' ""Time out!""
Now he kickin', screamin', yellin', disrespectin', bumpin' fast
I'm thinkin' to myself ""If that was my son I'd stomp his ass!""
My homie stopped me as he rolled up in his new car
Asked how I was doing, I said ""Not as good as you are""
Chopped it up a minute, as I peeped some other things he showed me
(What?) I'm thinkin' ""When is this fool gonna give me that $25 he owe me?""
I saw my homegirl on Cullen showing all her parts
""This girl weigh 280 why the hell she wearin' them tight ass shorts?""
Gave me her number, told me ""Let's go hang out one of these days""
I said ""Okay"" ""Man, when she leave I'm throwin' this number away""
This homeless dude said he was hungry, I said ""Alright here""
""Hold up, I know this dude didn't use my money to buy no beer!""

None of this is personal, so don't take it the wrong way

These are just some thoughts that we think everyday but don't say
These are just some thoughts that we think everyday but don't say

I'm at a show, concentratin' in my coolin' state
Ran into this other female that I used to date
She braggin' on herself, she done had too much to drink
She said ""I'm the best woman you ever had"" ""That's what you think""
This dude was on the mic, I'm wondering how long it last
""Man I hope I never hear you rap again, this song is trash!""
Police harassing people, ready to take some folks to jail
Checking boys for dope, ""Okay, y'all can leave"" ""Thanks"" ""Go to hell""
I saw this queen, as I was walkin' out, ""Man she fine!""
""Man she fine"" I said that out loud and in my mind
Saw this cat across the street, he talks a lot all in your ear
""What's up, K?"" ""What's up, bro?"" ""Man I hope he don't come over here""
""I'm comin' over there,"" ""Damn"" ""Okay"" Yeah yeah yeah I know I'm wrong
Forty five minutes later, there he was still going strong

These are just some thoughts that we think everyday but don't say
These are just some thoughts that we think everyday but don't say

Took my son to the mall, said ""Pick whatever shoes you want""
Headed towards them high ass Jordans, ""You like these?""
""Please say you don't"" ""Yeah, Daddy, these the ones""
""Try 'em on, see if you fit 'em"" ""Yeah they fit"" ""How much are they?"" ""Oh my god"" ""Okay, let's get 'em""
I see my partner braggin' like he had Obama clout
""This fool is lyin', he just got kicked out his mama house""
Wife been naggin' all day, askin' questions, tryin' to crowd
""Damn she gettin' on my nerves"" Wait, did I say that out loud?
Brought me out a plate of food, would've trashed it if I could
She said ""Do you like it?"" ""No"" ""Huh? Oh yeah, it's good""
Headed to my 9 to 5, money clean, no need to rob
""Morning, sir, ready to get to work"" ""Damn I hate this job""
Dude sellin' burnt CDs, comin' at me like I want 'em
""What you got?"" ""Promise if he pull mine out I'm swangin' on 'im""

Tension,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Trap is set and you the mouse, freely walking through your house
Relationship on the edge, barely talking to your spouse
Whole damn town is mad everybody down to blast
Vast majority upset and agger people bound to clash
Loud talk draped around, tried but can't escape the sound
Son getting older now he thinking he can take you down
Bucking up and feeling fat, now you got to deal with that
I knew this day would come man, I don't wanna have to kill this cat
Plus you wanna get your boss, he won't even let you talk
Mind on the edge now, slightest thing will set you off
Been around the block so don't treat me like a first-nighter
Walking down the street, white lady grips her purse tighter
Even though I paid my dues, man the devil hate to lose
Police got four or five tools that they can't wait to use
Racist ways coming out, shooting spraying tasing joking
Used to hide you when they beat you, now they whip you in the open. Tension

When I'm rolling through the hood I feel tension
When I step into my house I feel tension
As I'm walking down the street I feel tension
When I see the police I feel

Before I hit the corner I can already tell it's jumping
Loud music heavy bumping everybody selling something
Every-night a new disciple cheer the devil boo the bible
Prison waits for five-year-olds whose lives will soon go through the cycle
Running up and bang doors, blood baths paint floors
Shady women make you claim and raise babies that ain't yours
Close cats and drugs are life, somebody might bust tonight
Wife don't trust the husband, husband don't trust the wife
Cutting throats to climb the ladder, that'll make your wallet fatter
Daughter in the strip-club with rappers throwing dollars at her
Shots exploding through you should've did what you was told to do
Now you decomposing in a suit with loved ones standing over you
No sanity coz we lost it, stressing got the world exhausted
Government be tryin' to toss it, knowing they the ones who caused it
Every action is a part of dysfunctional thought-disorder
Daily friction in the family, father son mother daughter. Tension


Tension and apprehension as I pass through a suburban dimension
My neck feels the tightness of a lynching
Grinding male, walking through the hood with your mind in hell
The anxiety you feel your first time in jail
Tension, standing face to face with the main goon
One dude with both his baby-mamas in the same room
Finding out the one you trusted that's who busted ya
Two rival hustlers competing for street customers
Making a couple o' adjustments trying to keep others from touching ya
When life is thrusting shock suffering at your jugular
Heartless guys, see the ego gathers where the caucus lies
Fathers of the dark despise then lawyers rise and organize
All around, everybody's fighting in this sport of blood
Nothing more intense than when you got to stand before the judge
Freedom on the line, it's a everyday part of life
We cutting through it but it's hard to slice, we need a sharper knife. Tension",https://genius.com/K-rino-tension-lyrics
Talkin’ to Me,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"Ay K, psst, say K? I know you hear me man
I know you hear me man, K? C'mon man wassup?

I was sitting in my living room mapping out a plan
Strategizing on how to get a million in my hand
Man, right then and there something shot spark through me
I thought I heard my TV remote talk to me
He said, ""What's the deal, man? Why you straining out ya brain?""
You should chill for a minute, don't you wanna watch the game?""
I said, ""Yeah"". He said, ""Cool, pick me up and start flipping
Through the channels"", then my pants said, ""Hold up K, you tripping?""
You know you need to sit down and finish these rhymes
We're pressed for time, you about to miss your deadline
My rap book cosigned and said, ""Let's do it""
The stereo said, ""Nah, let's listen to some music""
The TV was down with the remote coming strong
Moaning and groaning, telling me to turn it on
Got me stressing cuz I know I need to finish up this song
I hear all these different voices yet I'm all alone

I don't know what's wrong with me
Man, I don't know what to say
Inanimate objects be talking to me everyday
Man, I think I'm gon' crazy cuz it just won't go away
Inanimate objects be talking to me everyday

I stood indecisively listening to the sounds
The bed said, ""Forget about them, just come lay down
You haven't been sleeping, this is where you need to be""
The television said, ""Yeah, while you lay, you can look at me""
I got a lot of work to do so no I won't listen
Soon as I sat down I heard a voice from the kitchen
I opened the refrigerator, who said what they said?
It was a pretty piece of fish, man I thought you was dead?
He said, ""Yeah, physically, but mentally you know wassup""
Stop debating with me K get a skillet and heat me up
I said, ""Man, I got work to do"" this is not a joke
Right then I heard my pistol say, ""Wassup homie you broke?
If you looking for a way to get some paper out the blue
Pick me up let's hit the streets, man, I know something we can do""
As I thought about the money, I was smiling at my strap
My mama picture looked at me and said ""Boy don't get slapped""


I said forget this I'm a work on some lyrics
My people need me, my stomach was screaming ""Feed me!""
A book was saying ""Read me!"" the phone started talking
It said, ""Why don't you call Sharell
The girl you met in Taco Bell"", I said, ""Well, what the hell""
When I grabbed the phone I noticed the TV was getting jealous
Said, ""You always on the phone, why don't you tell it what you tell us""
These stuff is calling me, my possession are out to get me
The computer said, ""Why don't you come spend a few hours with me?""
Then all once chaos and confusion started sparking
At the same time everything in the room started talking
They said, ""K-Rino you'll eventually have to face us""
My shoes said, ""We're tired, it's time for you to replace us""
See this is what's it's like man when you try to grind
And out of distraction visiting and taking over your mind
My homie came to my house sweating and choking
He said, ""My weed been talking to me, K I need to stop smoking""",https://genius.com/K-rino-talkin-to-me-lyrics
Steppin’ Up,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Sending this one out to the stepdads all around the world
The ones who came in and took all the responsibility
We salute you, man

You raise another man’s children, a matter of fact
It’s time to give every stepdad a pat on the back
Fell in love with the woman who was doing it alone
And you took care of her children like they was your own
Took the pressure off of her once you made up your mind
Food, clothes, pocket change, bills paid on time
Didn’t stop ‘cause you took their mother’s hand as your wife
You understood the importance of a man in their life
You didn’t mind ‘cause it was just the right thing to do
Now you love them the same as if they came from you
Had a few negative people all up in your biz
Like, “Why you getting with that girl if she got all them kids?”
Man, tell them folks to “Shut up!”, your purpose is known
The backbone that came along and made the family strong
Don’t let them discourage your efforts, you ain’t did nothing wrong
It’s time to recognize y’all and build you up in this song

So if nobody ever told you, thank you for stepping up
You rode in like a soldier, thank you for stepping up
The situation never fazed them, thank you for stepping up
Wasn’t yours but you raised them, thank you for stepping up
If nobody ever told you, 
thank you for stepping up
You rode in like a soldier, 
thank you for stepping up
Right on time when they need you, 
thank you for stepping up
Stayed with you didn’t leave you, 
thank you for stepping up

These days the average family is so unbalanced
Not many men are willing to take on that challenge
Lot of women got children but their real dad failed them
And they afraid that they gon’ scare a man off when they tell him
But a good man will separate the real and the fake
And whatever responsibility he’s willing to take
Pick them up from school, take them out when she need a break
Cook the food and hold the house down if she running late
If she got a son teach him what’s right and what’s not
Take him to the court with you, help him work on his shot
When he’s stepping out of line, he gon’ pull him in check
Teach him discipline, work ethic, manhood and respect
And if you got girls you don’t have to sit and be nervous
He trustworthy around your daughters, not sick and perverted
That’s a real man, the kind you better stick by hard
He the answer to your prayers, sister—sent by God

So if nobody ever told you, thank you for stepping up
You rode in like a soldier, thank you for stepping up
The situation never fazed them, thank you for stepping up
Wasn’t yours but you raised them, thank you for stepping up
If nobody ever told you, 
thank you for stepping up
You rode in like a soldier, 
thank you for stepping up
Right on time when they need you, 
thank you for stepping up
Stayed with you didn’t leave you, 
thank you for stepping up

You committed from the start and stuck with it for years
Even if he got his own, he treat hers like his
Sometimes they don’t like the stepfather, of course
Especially if their real daddy and their momma’s divorced
So they think you’re trying to take the biological's place
You gotta deal with the resentment from the child and the hate
But them seeing how you treat their mother changes their mind
And they eventually begin to except you in time
Some brothers met women with babies that was younger than 2
And been around so long you the only father they knew
You did everything that a true father should do
And when they got grown they still love and appreciate you
You deserve credit for being a gift from above
You didn’t do it for recognition, you did it for love
So youngsters in this situation be thankful and glad
And take the ‘step’ off the title and just call him your dad

So if nobody ever told you, thank you for stepping up
You rode in like a soldier, thank you for stepping up
The situation never fazed them, thank you for stepping up
Wasn’t yours but you raised them, thank you for stepping up
If nobody ever told you, 
thank you for stepping up
You rode in like a soldier, 
thank you for stepping up
Right on time when they need you, 
thank you for stepping up
Stayed with you didn’t leave you, 
thank you for stepping up",https://genius.com/K-rino-steppin-up-lyrics
Who Am I,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"(*talking*)
Yeah, nobody's perfect uh
Who am I

Ain't no commrottery, envy and jealousy dividing me
And rose the killer exposed, the after world side of me
Those I probably, confided and lied inside of me
For years, constantly evaluated me improperly
I teach game, like people taught it to me
My personality might not be, what you thought it could be
See it's easy to walk with me, when it's sunny and warm
But how many people gon stay down, through the cold and the storm
Am I perfect, I'll be the first to tell you I ain't
Just because I try to kick knowledge, don't make me a saint
Now who am I, I'm not the man you think you know
I'm trying to get up out the quicksand, 'fore I sink too low
I'm educated by the streets man, I done took my class
Trying to maintain, but the rap game done whooped my ass
The only part of me you know, is what I show you
But internally family and friends, can't even fathom what I go through

Now who am I, only a man just like you
I wrestle with myself, to figure out what I must do
Fuck knocking on a do', I'm trying to bust right through
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you
Now who am I, only a man just like you
I'm still struggling, ain't no telling what I just might do
Fuck knocking on a do', I'm trying to bust right through
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you

They say it helps to open up, it makes the soul feel good
Soon as you do it, people spread your bidness all through the hood
Living without love made hatred, the main thang that I thought of
And I done did a lot of things in the past, that I ain't proud of
I don't give women the respect, they deserve
I never hit one with my hands, but I've abused em with words
Many days I would, write lyrics to raise my hood
But I'm certain that my bad side, outweighs my good
I'm getting so tired of thinking, till my mind won't run
I'm getting tired of people telling me, that my time gon come
Maybe I suffer, cause of temptation I never resisted
Maybe my time already came, and I ain't know it and missed it
It ain't wise to share your dreams, with everybody know why
Cause even close friends, will wish negative thoughts in the sky
And when I see a arrogant ho, I squeeze his lid
I run with the thugs and the sinners, like Jesus did


God gives heaven to me, and other than he there never will be
One who can definitely say he knows who I am, better than me
Two things take place, when struggling starts
It either brings you closer together, or further apart
If I leave nothing behind, after the graveyard got me
Y'all gon mourn two or three weeks, then forget all about me
You out of sight you out of mind, once your heartbeat quit
And you can never be remembered, if you ain't did shit
Give you my last if I got it, ain't no greed in my bones
Last of my bloodline, I never had a seed of my own
I feel depression, cause it wasn't my intention to see
The next generation be born, with no extension of me
But hopefully, I can keep living on this earth through
The parts of my life that I write down, and give birth to
I ain't fraud but see, being right is hard to be
Excuse my evil side, just focus on the God in me

Now who am I, only a man just like you
I chase money, ain't no telling what I just might be
I get aggravated commit sins, and lust like you
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you
Now who am I, only a man just like you
I wrestle with myself, to figure out what I must do
Fuck knocking on a do', I'm trying to bust right through
So don't put me on no pedestal, I'm just like you
(*talking*)
Yeah homie, I'm working on myself
Just like you working on yourself man, you know
We gotta minister to eachother man, and try to pull eachother up
So uh when you see me, don't look at me as being no better than you are man
Cause it might be something that you can give me, that I don't have
So remember I'm just like you, yeah feel that",https://genius.com/K-rino-who-am-i-lyrics

Cross the line and get'cha face broke it's simple and plain
Twenty years and I ain't changed my intentions the same
So you can't talk about the game unless you mention my name

Yeah, it's certain people in this world you can't talk too
Some don't understand until they get they chest walked through
A pot-holes in they backs once the mack pops
I can't be destroyed I'm like a airplane's black box
Question is who's willing to be a sacrifice?
So rappers won't have to pay the price in the afterlife
Evacuate the premises; we ain't goin ask ya twice
Walk into a room cracking heads, no more acting nice
I stand hard and let em swang came too far to bend it
Plus I never needed? viagrace? at a soldered spin is
I'm rock-solid, brand new day the same ma-genders
I'm mobbed with F.O.I., street hustlers and gangbangers
The bridge is burn, the relationships beyond the groovement
Devils in power try'na execute the conscience movement
But if they try, get'cha heat and bring the thunder down
Since day one the realest music been the underground


You can't write me out a history, go read your lesson
My essence is too deeply imbedded in the past and the present
They want to keep this real music off the station good
Less bars, fake radio, cats from coming in the hood (kill em)

I'm leading corpses inside of this corporate machine
Commercial, radio ain't try'na resurrected the dead
So kill em all and bring the program direct it's head

No more meat, no more going through the proper channels
Keep stunning, it'll be your time to take some lead

You don't control by destiny I got mine in my hand
Shoutout to Dre, I wish ya homie I'm try'na get banned


Gravity's stunt on me better hope he last
Five lasers I blast with no ski-mask
Enter the suffering the end won't be fast
Murder your future and put'cha present in the past
Hoping he calm will K-Rino side trippin
It's bottom it'll get it poppin like grease and fried chicken
Undetectable bombs up in your ride diggin
The unmistakable sound of a soul five kickin
Don't be around and see em becoming you like Witted
Unless you gonna be a follower, follow the right leader
Ya still the grand dragon, show ya hand bragging
Ninety percent of rappers who riding on band-wagons
Wetting objects a man getting in your prophets
Quick the foil up when they threaten in ya pockets
Acting like you got no remorse for life
How you goin exit get pumped by corporate types?
You a fraud, living a lie and a facade
I'm under the control of no man regard
What's wrong when ya put'cha opportunities on
You really gone, anybody try'na do it alone
Not a problems that you can so honorable to stand
And the people at the shows you can't count on ya hand
Done with no love when a solid hitted fan
Spoken to spoke out right follow hit a fan
You was arrogant man, never been courted
With no respect of those who came before you
We can see it an evil side is disagreeable
Now people use your shirt to write in yo vehicles
Agree the main rights so ya mind will be tight
Stop try'na be like fools who try'na be like
Everybody who looking for a creative handout
Try'na stand in it's time to stand out",https://genius.com/K-rino-mention-my-name-lyrics

Spit fire, get weak, hustle, get lazy, it's kinda strange
But when it comes to me, I rock it the same, ain't nothing changed

Yeah, I tear rappers at the seams
I'll turn into a beam of atomic steam and melt you into cream
At a chance session I gave an advanced lesson
One glance ripped him to chips, so I dipped him in ranch dressing
We some sick men that split chins by spitting stick pins
The more I listen I see you full of it like chitlins
Man you know I said slanderous words, so you were scared
Like a rapper exposed on what they do in bed by Superhead
You can be on Neptune chilling, you still ain't out of K range
Styles in my X-Y-Z brain are dismantling your A-game
Your thoughts got misdirected, disrespected
Like a fat chick trying to hide out undetected in a room of anorexics
I'm set with awesome verbs that toss and serve
You like a misplaced dictionary, you at a loss for words
Said you could wreck me, see that's when I tag 'em
See you deceiving yourself, just like a fool with three inches wearing a magnum

I seen 'em come and go, jump on, fall off, get hot and cold
Make money, go broke, come out being real then sell they soul
Spit fire, get weak, hustle, get lazy, it's kinda strange
But when it comes to me, I rock it the same, ain't nothing changed

K-Rino losing to you in front of my rap fans
Is like the chance of a legless man receiving a lap dance
Crushing me is impossible partner, so why try?
That's like a three foot tall man tryna give me a high five
Fool, you ain't a star, your whole act is fraud
You couldn't be third string water boy on a practice squad
Man my flow massive, can't be beaten by low tactics
I crack bastards and bump you off faster than Proactiv
A two page quote with the speed of Usain Bolt
A pair of rhymes simultaneously through a two lane throat
The style you tried ain't no comparison to what I do
You threw up cause your vomit was embarrassed to be inside you

I seen 'em come and go, jump on, fall off, get hot and cold
Make money, go broke, come out being real then sell they soul
Spit fire, get weak, hustle, get lazy, it's kinda strange
But when it comes to me, I rock it the same, ain't nothing changed

Studied my wordplay and still nobody can reach this
I'll drop a twenty CD set, fifty songs on each disc
The pessimist who subjected your family to high pestilence
I'll give you the answer days before you tell me what the question is
You ain't safe in the cypher the way K eat
You don't belong like Hennessy at a damn AA meet
Them boring phrases you say deep, you couldn't pay me to speak
They play your shit at daycare centers to put babies to sleep
You got a less than retarded mind, I'll stop your shine
You like a box of cordless phones: you ain't got no lines
Fumes come out me, I open you up like a house key
Years after you die you'll still have nightmares about me
You ain't worthy of a bad contract so never mind you
Quit trying dude, you could suffer hearing loss, I wouldn't sign you
And if you forget about my talent I'll find you
Blow out ya brains and put a new one in your head just to remind you

I seen 'em come and go, jump on, fall off, get hot and cold
Make money, go broke, come out being real then sell they soul
Spit fire, get weak, hustle, get lazy, it's kinda strange
But when it comes to me, I rock it the same, ain't nothing changed",https://genius.com/K-rino-aint-nothin-changed-lyrics
Dem Laws,Solitary Confinement,2009.0,"""Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century""

How come y'all like to bother people on the black folk side of town
We can't even throw a block party without y'all tricks coming around
Everyday all they wanna do is hit you hard
What you looking for? I don't sip no bar
Ripping up seats in my brand new car
Damn, man, y'all taking this shit too far
Preposterous, just cause of who I am I get harassed
I just ask ya for ya badge number and damn you wanna blast
Tryna shatter me and break me like a hammer to some glass
Then slam you on the grass, even with that camera on the dash
Mr. Gram of potent hash, my homegirl Pamela had stashed
Flunked an exam from ghetto class a first day amateur could pass
He was mad because we had bang and was jamming it on blast
I should have ran cause I don't think his fat ass stamina could last
They might follow from your door to Mexico
Hope your gun accidentally go off and shoots you through your own ass like Plaxico
In 59 pieces of your vest will blow
These police giving took-out everyday, keep harassing, you'll be the next to go

""Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century""

These pigs used to wanna peel you. ""What you mean used to? They still do""
Make no mistake cause you living the ghetto these police is out to kill you
The whole department's racist, pull you over in the darkest places
When they walk upon you pull your piece and let it spark in their faces
Go to the courthouse, everyday the same replay
Satan in the form of the cops, the judge and the DA
The truth is most black people are lacking info
They never knew about the Willie Lynch Letter or Jim Crow
They want you dead or locked up so they keep coming hard
Bloodshed, they never bored, they'll shoot you in your mama's yard
We having a party, we done sewed up the whole block
What's the occasion? A racist cop just got his ass popped
Yay! Some of y'all might think this just a song
But this gon' keep on happening till y'all learn to leave us alone
The next stunt will make the whole hood go crazy
What kind of coward will use a taser on an old lady?

""Dem laws is tryna lock us up for the whole century""

Fuck Dem Laws (Fuck 'em) Tryna lock a nigga for a whole century
Put a nigga in jail and don't give a damn about what he plead
They'll take your cash, strip your ass, finger print and take your belt
Make you bent over and cough, goddamn I ain't got nothing else
First of all I'm in this bitch and I really don't even suppose to be
I was at the club chilling and two motherfuckers lied on me
Now I'm fighting the case, pin a lawyer and I still got bills on my back
I got caught up in some bullshit, real talk, nigga I do this
I suppose I should write my judge a long letter
And tell her I ain't coming back and she owe me 50 stacks
And my daddy always told me, ""Never-never get scared, nigga
Look 'em in their eyes, stand strong, you a man, nigga""
So fuck it, two tears in the bucket
All of the DA's, prosecutors and judge can suck it
Can't water cask for fucking killer
Ready to murk, every five-o nigga, for reala

Strong Game,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Come on, haha haha ha
What is this? Strong game
Strong game, strong game, strong game
Let's go

I got that strong game, better not catch you rolling the wrong lane
I'm so long, man, that I name drop my own name
Mob boss, silence folks, lift ya like a pot of dope
Style kaleidoscope, boy you shady as a college coach
To get your whole crew swept 'cause you slept
Me, I'm smooth enough to stand on one foot and two-step
I might hit ya with this scripture then I ain't gon' worry with ya
This game I'ma take it over like a blurry picture
The lyric-stealer convicter, my dope curriculum, who could pass?
Stupid lad, you in a English class tryna do the math
Super bad, show you how the old school do their ass
Run up on a pack of young rappers and  their ass
Leaving heathen rappers believing teaching with perfect meaning
Satan can't possess me, I spit a verse and convert the demon
We the same but we different, listen fast
In a skill race I'm never last and you never last
I'm just tryna have loot, rappin' for the grassroots
I'll break my foot up in ya ass with a glass boot
I'm great indeed but it seem like they ain't takin' heed
Fakers breed, forget your hairline, I make your face recede
My game is strong, been that way since I came along
Now my brain is warm, you want beef, I got an angus for 'em
Beat ya from sideways, forward or reverse
Construct my house and build the second floor before the first
You're not yet at the number of pages I blessed
The people trust me like I was the process
It's like a belt when my sequences are felt
So unguardable, I started playing defense on myself
Got a all around shine that'll make a man blind
Advanced mind, I'll email you from a landline
Wouldn't go see you for three bucks, all of your beats suck
Me I'm in the streets, doing donuts in a Brink's truck
Rappers reluctant to speak much, posting that weak stuff
But I think deep enough to make the West and East touch
Shadow be clutch, K is the bigger threat while you quick to flex
I be knowing what you 'bout to say like predictive text
They get depressed when I raise to the next stage
Social media has created the instant mess-age
Everybody gossiping, poppin' off on they ex page
Using it to display ignorantly expressed ways
I label you secondary, I'm primary
Phones still ringing, I stay booked like libraries
Remember these clever similes and metaphors
They ready for war, boys is lower than credit scores
It'll be easy defeating this punk
Kill your career faster than a black celebrity meeting with Trump
I go to new lengths, my days is spent tryna pursue rent
The blueprint, I charge $50 for my two cents
Watch your mouth, I am not your seed
Boy please, how you the GOAT and you ain't got no cheese?
I make 'em  while I'm mobbin' for bread
Spit with no beat and people still bobbin' their head
And it's amazing how I keep winning like Nick Saban
I'm brazen, playing dirty as if I quit bathing
Unsurpassable battler, my mic hand shakes like a rattler
So when I rap, I get madder than Jim Adler
Hoping I let you slide for your ignorant trash
But see I'm like a ball hog, I'll never give you a pass
You talkin' big from a distance but I knew you was the type to runnin'
When I'm in your face, you wanna leave like a psycho comin'",https://genius.com/K-rino-strong-game-lyrics
My Girlfriend’s Boyfriend,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"What a crazy year
Ha ha ha ha
Don't pay no attention to me man
I just be thinking stuff
Maybe I'm just a lil' paranoid but I

I wonder what it's like be my girlfriend's boyfriend
I'm certain that with him she never acts so annoying
Straight drama with me, but a angel with her side dude
Does she sit with him and vent about the things that I do
Layin' on his lap for some sympathy, does she cry too?
When I think about it, it's kinda crazy in my view
Never showing attitude with him, that's what I thought bra
Now he's benefiting from everything I taught her
He thinkin' he got him an innocent little rose
But the sinister demented within her ain't been exposed
You ain't even been around her long enough to hear her mouth ring
Must be nice to not have to beg her to keep the house clean
Stop running the streets, stop being at this and that club
Five years with her I ain't never got a back rub
All I ever do is sit up hoping that noise end
Wonder what's it like to be my girlfriend's boyfriend

I wonder what's it like to be my girlfriend's boyfriend
Everything cool, no fighting, no arguing, no going hard
'Cause words are blood boiling
All I ever did was sit back hopin' the war ends
Wonder what's it like to be my girlfriend's boyfriend
Everything cool, no fighting, no arguing, no going hard
'Cause words are blood boiling
All I ever wanted to do was make the war end

I guess I gotta let you know I'm surprised
She no longer looks at me with that glow in her eyes
I'ma tell ya how to know it's getin' bad though bro (listen)
When no matter what you do she don't get mad know more
You tell her you about to leave, she just told you to go
She gettin' all dressed up just to go to the store
I guess one day we gon' square it off I assume
Now when the phone rings she grab it and walk out the room
But when she come back she smiling, nothing left to see
Now she on the internet looking up dinner recipes (what)
All this time I thought I was givin the best of me
Now we can even talk without a referee
She coming home with new gifts and things
When she on Facebook and I walk in she switch the screen
3 A.M. whisperin' on the phone, I straight swore
She was talking to Jake, but not that dude at State Farm
Come on

I wonder what's it like to be my girlfriend's boyfriend
Everything cool, no fighting, no arguing, no going hard
'Cause words are blood boiling
All I ever did was sit back hopin' the war ends
Wonder what's it like to be my girlfriend's boyfriend
Everything cool, no fighting, no arguing, no going hard
'Cause words are blood boiling
All I ever wanted to do was make the war end

I guess I gotta bounce back like a rubber band
I'm at the crib, jam and toast to the other man
I'm like whatever, if she having her fun, let her
I'm sittin' here thinking what I've could've done better
Now I gotta man up but it's scary though
And all I'm tryna say if it's over just let me know
Gettin' dumped, uh-huh, I know how that feel
'Cause the things that you won't do another cat will
My phone rung, man, it's her, I ain't believing that
I'm saying ""hello, hello"" but ain't nobody speaking back
Heard a little mumbling, hold up what was that sound?
Real deep voice talking smooth in the background
Then I heard her breathing all passionate
Now I realized that she called me by accident
Hung it up quick before they went all in
Now I know what it's like to be my girlfriend's boyfriend

Well, I see what it is now
I guess I'll go on in here and eat these lil' Fig Newtons I got in the kitchen, man
Call it a night

Choose Ya Weapon,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"The depths of my Black Book equals an ocean
Strong verbal aggressor with the pacifist notion
Plans I devise to uprise and lift
Scams I despise corrupt lives and riff
Never inept, never slept, never need a gun
Followers fake because I'm making their leader run
Deep on the topic but never posed as a prophet
Concepts kick through common sense, so I drop it
Misunderstood cause I'm far from generic
Categorised as lethal legend of a lyric
You should abide to the rule that apply to
Your crew as I guide with side one and side two
But even with that, these suckers constantly ride me
Flipping my LP in search of a Side 3
'90 is through, I'm crushing you and your tiny scores
Slapped you through '93, be there to catch you in '94
Thoughts in my head backed up like traffic
Rap book plastic, memory photographic
The unachievable to me is none believable
Cause what can't be achieved by K is non conceivable
Able to reach by reality or blind faith
Be it concrete, abstract or a mind state
Total separation of thoughts avoid collisions
Mental incisions create sub-divisions
Of my brain which allowed me to demonstrate the know how
Busting through a wack life crew like a snow plough
Mic is a sword, rhythm rap book my shield
While you're sweating to hold nine yards, trick 'em down field
Never letting my head get boosted
The whole damn album, K and Dope produced it
I take a malnourished beat and feed it
Break out the ice cream and milk, I need it
Kick

War on the microphone, choose your weapon ah
War on the microphone, choose your weapon ah
War on the microphone, choose your weapon ah

Five element's life, health, strength, mind and deepness
Memorise what I emphasise, don't sweep this
Under the rug cause it'll lump up
Vocal combinations translated into two words: Jump Up
Information I'm consuming is looming
In me cause ain't enough room in the brain of a normal human
Thoughts bionic, twice as potent as gin and tonic
Psychological booms are sonic, brain tumours are chronic
The administrator, hit a later, proper waiter flow
Call K the bloodstream contaminator
Pay the cost of dissing while I flex my dialects
Equivalent to ten train wrecks in emcees necks
Lyrical touches expose your two equipments, such as
Wheelchairs, respirators, IVs and crutches
Definition I'm the main black you aimed at
Sent a thousand suckers, not one of them came back
All opposition alluded me, excluded me
From rhyming activity thinking they executed me
But K is the prodigy giving punks a lobotomy
Once received an apology from a bullet that shot at me
I'm breaking up pieces, high priest of a thesis
Voice range releases, death rate increases
Feel a diss, the realist swings with a killer fist
Never missed when pissed, mercenary ventriloquist
No re-enactment it's actual battery
Glad to be the highest majesty of a tragedy
Poetically socialised, mobilised, I'm noble wise
Double my size, I'll visualise through a thousand eyes
Give me room to stick, you'll be who I'm soon to pick
Sign language communicating bulletproof lunatic
Artillery room stocked with weaponry
Those who step at me are stabbed to death with mental telepathy
You face the ace lyrical high speed chase
Erase one who fabricates, corruptiveness I embrace
The free worded overexerted, overruler of verdicts
Suckers flirted and found out that lyrics hurted
Yo, any game is a fair game
Tie me up and drop me in a live volcano from an airplane
Yo, and I’ll live to untangle, return to strangle
And square off the Bermuda Triangle
Yo, vocalism creates a prism
Tactician of demolition, breaker of ambition
Title snatcher conflict, catcher K-Rino is a cat
Certain attack, you want your tongue, I’ll mail it back

War on the microphone, choose your weapon ah
War on the microphone, choose your weapon ah

Them picking an axe, them picking a stick and they hit 47
But me weapon is me tongue, me critical radical lyrical gun
Make a verse with one million and make critical styles
K-Rino me I'm the Father and me Black Book the child
I'm bringing the dominant lyrical legacy
Making the melodramatic vocalists bite the dust man
It's critical quick to call man",https://genius.com/K-rino-choose-ya-weapon-lyrics
Amnesia,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"I don't know where I'm at or who I am, I'm being asked
If I recognize certain places and faces, scriptures and diagrams
Evaluations to see where my mind is
They said I'll understand in due time but I don't know what time is
They bring a woman in to visit me
And she descriptively begins to give to me vivid periods of my history
I'm trying to figure out who this could be
A mystery it all persist to be, right now I don't even exist to me
She kisses me like she been missing me
Then instantly the doctor gives her paper with twenty words on a list to me
For hours he tried to empower me
And out of the twenty, nineteen I couldn't place but one was jumping out at me
I don't feel crazy, I'm very sane
I'm trying to gain recollection, the doctor matches pictures up to every name
I try to concentrate to remember but nothing comes
I overheard the doctor tell the same lady I'm suffering from Amnesia

My world, ain't the same
Don't know who I am, I don't know my name
Can't remember my life, I can't remember my ways
Can't remember my nights, I can't remember my days

Now, they bring me to a different bed and hooked me up to a machine
That gave his thoughts when they strapped it to your head
Was I a righteous man or evil dude, they judged my feelings
To certain words based on how fast the needle moves
My reactions would diversify, the words they said sparked emotion
Some made me laugh and others made me cry
The needle jumped out at a crazy pace and when he said
The word from the list that he gave me, I saw the lady's face
They brought a young child in
Who began to shed tears until he looked into my eyes and started smiling
Like he was happy that he found me, something was familiar about the feeling
When he wrapped his arms around me, listen
Something is coming back, I'm reminiscing
A distant memory of me and this child but there was somebody missing
Where was this other person at, part of this puzzle could be deciphered
If something could bring that person back
It's no mirrors in this room I'm at, to prove this fact
They handed me a picture of myself and I asked em who is that
I start to drag like I'm going mad
It was something making me feel hatred for this picture even though I had
Amnesia
(Hook x2)

I tore the picture up and then I screamed
The frustration of not knowing nothing of nobody was just too extreme
Hopes that my memory could be redeemed
I'm still struggling with the one word that seemed to outshine the other 19
They strapped me down like a wild man, the lady walked back in the room
With another female who held the child's hand
When I felt that presence it calmed me, but as they swarmed me
The calm became a storm cause what they sung alarmed me
I heard the hate they spoke with optics blurred
Telling me the reason I forgot them and myself was I forgot the word
Right then I felt it like a gust of wind
A voice said wake up, I heard clapping and I was on a stage with 2 other men
Opened my eyes and realized, G
A hypnotist had hypnotized another man and at the same time hypnotized me
He said raise your arm and hold it up
The other hypnotized man was the Dr and in my hand the list was folded up
I opened it wondering what can it be
It was the 19 words from the fantasy, the list consists of friends and family
Yeah my mother wife and son is who those people was
And the one word from the list that seemed to stand out was the word 'Love'
Suppressed in my subconscience mind, 
amnesia in this case
Is when love is in you but you forget to show it all the time
Now back to normal, he's converting me
Said I wouldn't recall a thing, went back to my seat
And told Dope, ""I told you it wouldn't work on me""

Highs and Lows,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"Man we on a roller coaster for real...
First they take you real high
Then they bring you real low
Everyday is a challenge, gotta find that balance
Gotta deal with it though
High electronic devices and food prices
Media manufacturer paranoia of ISIS
Ignorance every dose, very few people's hopes
Millions of folks cause of pills and dope that they smoke
High flood waters and wild fire flames
Light bill, gas bill any other you name
Blood pressure, illiteracy world wide destruction
Hospital bills plus political corruption
United States of Americas deficit amount
The military war budget the casualty body count
Black defendants and foolish concerns over what's trending
Dependence materialistic frivolous spending
Stress and poverty and the rate of angers velocity
Religious mockery frustration and animosity
What else is real high? Injustice and evil
The incarceration rated the black and the poor people
Low
The bars on your phone battery
The amount of people who care for you
A poor mans salary
Unity in the hood, as lowest I ever seen
What else? Hell, intelligence levels of self esteem
Love and loyalty, the desire to end hate
Concerns for healthy living, nutritional intake
The need to help others, the heart to start giving
What's even lower than that is respect for our Women
Knowledge and understanding
Loyalty to your fam
Children that wanna learn, teachers who give a damn
The number of police officers to defend you
The amount of help of a person that's less fortunate than you
Low is the quantity of groceries in our kitchen
And low is the quality of our living conditions
Low blows and led them to claiming our bread and it's so low this worlds got us hanging our head
This is the way it should be
High expectations morals and high decency
Higher thoughts traveling on a super high frequency
Higher Education each day that goes by
High Heavenly attributes from the Most High
High status minus the stress sickness and strife
No medial job descriptions, high positions in life
Number one so everything else comes after you
Traveling the planet flying at a high altitude
Low crime and no crime no lies to tell ya
Low ignorance equals a low chance of failure
Never feeling low it's enough love to go around
Nobody being low class or acting low down
Low moments was hard but they never broke me
When it comes to life relax and keep it low key
Stay high on life even if you hit some low notes cause for true growth you gotta experience both",https://genius.com/K-rino-highs-and-lows-lyrics
T.B.E.,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"A lot of discussion about this topic
It's going on right now, so let me clarify
Who's the best ever?
Hahaha

Who's the best rapper ever?
Many people debate long
First thing you have to determine is what it's based on
Is it setting a cultural tone, or making great songs?
But this is a subject most people evaluate wrong
Can one artist ever be held?
One method that never fails is the deceptive spell that is reflected by record sales
Many went platinum but hell there's other factors that tell how a cat can prevail even when he's not rapping as well
As an artist who isn't handed an exorbitant chance
A big budget with an advance and a guarding marketed plan
That targets the fans from near and the farthest of lands and places the largest audience in the palm of his hands
It's so much involved that it's impossible to try and solve the topic forever stalled and perpetual dialogue
Plus there's a section of those with unquestionable flows who got silent followers eventhough they're lesser exposed so WHO'S THE BEST EVER?

Every year I've been hearing the talk about who's career is the most surpierior
But what's never made clear is the qualifying criteria
Some lyrically sever, some write stories that's clever
You have to consider different rap categories and errors
Talking and sharing, arguments fans often having, get lost because they talk different styles cross comparing
A top 40 pop chart top and commercialized
Rappers different from the type who can lyrically murdered guys
Solo artists and groups been around since the youth of the movement
Early contributions were lost and the music's evolution
Many originals who helped root the institutions are victims of noninclusion cause time cruelly consumed em
So being an innovator of is not a component
Cause media is known to uplift those to hot at the moment
National magazines only put who's popular on it
We watch and condone it, take what they do, copy and clone it

Rap gets infinite play
Thousands of artists be spittin' a day
To proclaim a single best, there's no definitive way
You can span a terrain, poll every fan in the game and the answer would never land on a unanimous name
Multiple evidence to why certain Rappers we hold in reverence
Could be cultural relevance or just personal preference
Millions'll listen just through the diaspora or broken down? in the continents, countries, states, cities and little towns
I straight up confess, it could take decades to assess
Who be labeled the greatest? Many Rappers phrases are Blessed
So I stray from the mess and let the rest debate and contest, cause most people don't know the difference between favorite and best
Some people are geographically biased beyond length
Where an artist is born and raised, shapes his content
And it's thousands of unknown true masters of words
So The Best Ever could be a rapper you never heard",https://genius.com/K-rino-tbe-lyrics
Release It,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Can I take a second?
To speak to you through me
Cause I would love for you
To speak to me through yourself
But that's what we gotta do
Release it
Now

Give me a second and let me vent a little
I promise I won't get mushy or sentimental
I know this ride is temporary like I was in a rental
Any resemblence to your life is just coincidental
A real person will I be the true one?
Grey hairs keep coming, everyday I spot and new one
See when I was younger I was bad and wild
Now that I'm older I kinda wish I woulda had a child
I gotta be strong for others when they having trials
So even when I'm feeling low, depressed or sad I smile
And I ain't giving up so cancel that
Used to only talk to myself but now I answer back
Peep the game on how the devil do
He try to get you for all your spiritual revenue
Pushing you to be misguided and misdirected
New problems popping up just like an instant message

Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Confession is medicine for the soul my friend

Let's take a journey through my mental maze, I'm the guide
One time I quit rapping and started working nine to five
Satisfied with being broke no longer 'bout my wealth
Started to question who I was began to doubt myself
Reduced the mediocrity so I drew the conclusion
That doing music was a true convoluted illusion
The foolish thought my gift was useless seems stupid but proven
Failure to try to learn the truth is the root of confusion
A voice spoke to me in anger asking, ""What you doing?""
You should be moving towards your goal, how come you not pursuing?
You supposed to mash, fight the past, hustle like yo dad
Get off ya ass and do it fast' I said alright my bad
I started mashing hard and turning back was never mentioned
Been self-controlled and independent ever since then
My dream I was wasting it cause I was scared of chasing it
Having fear ain't the problem the problem's never facing it

Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Confession is medicine for the soul my friend

My woman curses me deservingly
Which discourages and worries me because we're not communicating verbally
And even though she means the world to me
It now nervously occurs to me that she currently might not be the girl for me
Am I flawed in my actions? Obviously
I know my own philosophy is filled with double standards and hypocrisy
But despite this dichotomy I strive to be
Real with those who real with me, and try to be the best person that I can be
My greatest quality is self-motivation
I'm the product of the wildest streets and that's the side of me I show the nation
I seen it all I've been defenseless, afraid
But at a early age I grew out of my sensitive stage
Now I'm grown and I'm still standing strong nothing's scaring me
If you gotta cry, go ahead and cry tears are therapy
I promise whatever you going through will be done in time
Keeping it in ain't never good, say what's on your mind

Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Release it, let it go, it ain't good to hold it in
Confession is medicine for the soul my friend",https://genius.com/K-rino-release-it-lyrics

Oh you ain't gonna tell me where he at...
That's cool, let me show you how to deal with this

First you find out where he hangs out then hide out
Find a spot post up wait for him to slide out
If he rollin by himself catch him before he ride out
Come behind him with the heat and put it right by his mouth
Do you kill him? Not now, just act like we are
Swing a crowbar until you hear that crack in his jaw
Cover his head and toss him in the back of a car
So he can't recall or try to track what he saw
Make sure he's unconscious before your found with him
Transfer him to the trunk and drive around the town with him
Then take him to the house where you can pull in the garage
Because you don't want to be seen and this eliminates the odds
So once you got him inside let the games begin
Pick that crowbar up again and start beatin on his shins
Make him know the definition of true wig splitter
Make him cry like he made your sister cry when he hit her

See that's how you do that's how you do it
You ain't gotta bring the police or no judges into it
He was putting his hands on her man and everybody knew it
Just focus on his head and run that bat right through it... See

I know you ain't gonna let this ride pause man, comma
This dude done moved in and put his hands on your momma
You ever heard that old phrase death before dishonor
This fool must of smoked some superman marijuana
But little do he know he about to meet a bad destiny
Go to mommas house and find out where she keep that extra key
Murder mode, fast forward can't nobody pause it
Wait until you know they gone and hide inside the closet
3 hours... 4 hours, yeah I know that's sorrta strange
Stay in there the whole time that's gonna make you more deranged
You don't want your mom to know she would just try stopping you
You can handle this alone or bring a friend it's optional
Bro this dude done hit your mom missed me with that boring logic
Wait 'til he lay on the bed and strike him with a foreign object
Tie him up beat his face in kill his pride
Put one of your momma's dresses on him drag him outside
Then take him to the hood and let the streets get up in him
With a sign on his chest that say I love hittin' women
Then go back in the house talk to momma and console her
And simple explain to her her relationship is over
Hey!

See that's how you do that's how you do it
You ain't gotta bring the police or no judges into it
He was putting his hands on her man and everybody knew it
Just focus on his head and run that bat right through it
See that's how you do that's how you do it
You ain't gotta bring the police or no judges into it
He was putting his hands on her man and everybody knew it
Just focus on his head and run that bat right through it... See...

Your daughters so intelligent you filled her up with knowledge
Felt real proud when you sent her off to college
When she was at home you would walk her in and walk her out
Now she messin with this dude that she don't like to talk about
Now they at the same school... how the hell that happen?
Every time you call he in the background yappin'... cussin
But when you try to warn her nothings getting through
She actin like she scared so you ask her is he hittin' you
Fool snatched the phone even cussed you out on one account
Heres what you do... show up at the campus unannounced
Roll up on your daughter, man I knew it got a black eye
We got something real special planned out for that guy
First I would call the cops, hold up I know what your feelin'
Not on him on myself cause it's about to be a killin'
Walk up in his face what up youngster you remember me
I'm Daddy ain't no violence yet but there's fixin' be

Hey hey what's up dude, what's up what you doin' here
Naw you know what it is... what you talkin bout what you talkin' bout...
Did you enjoy givin' my daughter that black eye... what you talkin' bout man...
Well we're gonna see how much you like this
Come here hey hey hold him snipe... put the thing... put the thing on his head man
Alright pull around back... naw naw naw it's to late you're the one who did it...
You know you're the one who did it hahahaha... uh huh
We gonna see how you like this bro
HA yeah, your beatin' days is over... matter fact all of your days are over

Folks going through things the same way you are
Maybe if we pull together on some of this stuff
We can fix it a little faster
Maybe

Yesterday I woke up and choked up
Thinking 'bout life's cold touch that holds us back
And then provokes us to lose focus
And broke us from the great wisdom we soaked up
Cheap clothes, car repos' and street foes
Mailman bringing bills he can keep those
Grocery store's full banned pig feet bro
No matter how hungry I get, I'll never eat those
Man at the intersection begging for ends
Seen that fool three hours later, he was driving a Benz
Nothing discreet, the whole world's full of lies and deceit
I had homies turn on me like I was a street
Seen my old partner on the block and asked him, ""What's happenin' man?""
Knew that he was struggling when he answered, 'Oh, I can't complain'
They lied when they said it's hard but it's fair
I see the hard part daily but the fair is very rare, so understand

So many trials may come, don't turn around and run
When all is said and done, guess I'm not the only one
Some people say they love you, they take advantage of you
When all is said done, know you're not the only one

Going through some things tryna make it through the cycle
You are not the only one there's millions more like you
A lot of cats are going through it, you just can't see his baggage
Lots of women dealing with abortions or a miscarriage
Disparage, emotional damage is substantial
Our problem's spiritual and mental, not financial
Swing on your enemies no matter what the size of them
It ain't that I don't have problems, I'm just good at disguising them
Calm, cool, collected on the outside is my daily face
But in my head all hell is breaking loose and taking place
Sitting in the grease, it's hot, popping and sizzling
Can't make it through the storm if you faint when it starts drizzling
Unexpected expenses, my money started fizzling
Man, oh well, I guess it is what it is again
Trials are like a video game, let me show you
When you take a loss, hit the reset and start it over, see


I hope God put a little sense up in your head
I hope you stop hustling before you end up dead
Hope we make it to the good life that we heard about
I hope you and your baby daddy work it out
No respect for each other, man y'all say whatever
Raise your child fool, y'all ain't gotta stay together
Things are different from the days you used to lay together
No need to hate each other, when it's over pray for better
I used to feel like I was going through it all the time
But other people's problems made me thank the Lord for mine
My design, plenty hatred not a lot of love
Steady getting punched in the face with life's boxing gloves
To every family who lost someone to suicide
Or any other reason why someone you knew had died
Maybe our suffering is to humble and remove our pride
Depending on each other helps us make it through this ride",https://genius.com/K-rino-not-the-only-one-lyrics
Gotta Get Better,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"Things gotta get better (Things gotta get better)
We struggle everyday (We struggle everyday)
To find a solution (To find a solution)
And make a better way (And make a better way)

The other night, I was watching snapped on TV
It was a repeat, but I was knee-deep in a storyline thinking that this could be me
My foot up in that same shoe, what do you do
To cope with the fact that not many of your dreams ever came true
You try to look beyond the surface
You hope and pray that God kept you from the frontline and the limelight for a greater purpose
Morbid scars man and blinded from far
Am I the only one who sees how sick minded we are?
They say forgive and forget is the way we should live
But I've been burned so many times that I forgot how to forgive
What you think is cool ain't cool homie, start living wise
Come out of your trance, pull up your pants, look civilized
We identify with dirt, we can't even spell hope
Our condition is why these youngsters prostitute and sell dope
But through it all, I'm still down with 'em I'll never impeach 'em
And everytime I get a chance to chop it up with 'em, I teach 'em
 x2

This past year I've learned that most people's love for you only stems (From what?)
From you being a shoulder, and what you can do for them
But when the doing's done and there's no more to give the friendship's through
Trying your best not to deny them, you end up denying you
So what must I do to rid myself of those who are untrue
One's who seek only for self and when exposed start acting new
While I was helping you, my own problems multiplied and grew
Who can the counselor speak to when he needs to be counseled to?
So I speak to God and vent-out my frustrations and my rages
And he answers me directly through the scriptures in his pages
And I argue with myself while guilt and pain funnel through me
And I'm trying to break the trend of hurting people closest to me
I ain't trying to please the world yeah I wouldn't mind being rich
But I ain't laughin' when it ain't funny or scratchin' when it don't itch
Wise words from a wise man and I never forgot
I'd rather be hated for who I am than be loved for who I'm not
 x2

Lord can I talk to you for a minute I'm kinda trippin'
I know I've been outta line lately, fallin' off and slippin'
But um, I wanna thank you God for helpin' me through it all
I know I'll slip again but I pray that you'll never let me fall
Please forgive me for acts I've carried out places I've been
Or having the nerve to ask for a blessing five minutes after I sin
Please guide me to obedience, cause I know that you demand that
I'm blessed, I know my life could be worse and I understand that
But it's like I'm still strugglin' and I'm gettin' bitter and hateful
And when people sufferin', me asking for things seems ungrateful
I just wanna feed my family, barely getting by is unnerving
And only you know the real me and we both know I'm undeservin'
When you start itching with flames help me get out of that range
Remove the urge for me to go left and push my heart to change
And when I'm face to face with temptation help me to be strong
And please don't let me stop doin' right cause others are did me wrong",https://genius.com/K-rino-gotta-get-better-lyrics

Told them people from the top, ain't no way that I'mma stop
Haters find it hard to get through to me like my numbers blocked
The way these swag boys act I ain't surprised at that
Watch me kill a beat, double back and revive the track
Why you mad at me, partner? I'm just describin' facts
Best line I heard you say is ""Would you like some fries with that?""
I'm in your crib 'cus somebody but the hit out
He kicked his own door down from the inside tryin' to get out
Dead kittens laying everywhere who let that pet out?
Rappers is dry heavin', no more blood left to spit out

Practice hard before the fight, now it's time for war tonight
Want his girlfriend in the battle, but took his mama she's more my type
These fellas so soft, I don't even need my fist to fight 'em
Your songs sound like you let your little sister write 'em
Do what you got to do, and I'mma put a stop to you
These boys is walkin' around souped up like they got the flu
I don't care about the drank or the strippers or the weed up in your limo
I'm a underground CEO with my own label I don't need to send no demo
Drop a real short passage that be way above average
All these silly rabbits rapping 'bout they drug habits
And I heard your track was booboo, that ain't new news
Your single been on YouTube for 11 months, with only 22 views
10 from you, 7 from your lil' partner who mixed it
And the other 5 from a few dudes who accidentally clicked it

I saw your pages you dot your eyes with smiley faces
My words are symmetrically embedded with no edits
And to my credit I can repeat what you say before you said it
This industries pathetic, full of hateful games
I want cash I ain't tryin' to wear your record label chain
It'd be different if you paid us good and took us to the moon
Gimme my bread I don't need you to send no hookers to my room
You can keep your drugs fam, I ain't judgin' I ain't hatin'
I'm just sayin' once that high wear off them bills gon' still be waitin'

In the daytime you thuggin', chasin' profits and ends
But every night, you hangin' out with your androgynous friends

When they hear me rap they go ""Ooh, hol' up, rewind, what'd he say?""

Strip Down,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Woo!
It's almost about that time
Man, let's see what's going on (police sirens)
They out there tonight
That's why I'm staying inside, ha ha
Man what's taking this girl so long?
She shoulda been here
Uh-oh there she go
Pulling in the driveway
Ay, what's up?
Yeah, hey you remember what we talked about, huh
Still goin do it, huh
Don't get scared
I got'chu
Come on

Come inside relax your mind if your guards wanna come down just let em
You got too many layers on you baby girl it's time to shut em
No need for shyness it's our secret come on let me peep it
That you can keep it I'm just try'na see what's underneath it
Strip down yeah take all of that outside hatred off
And all the pain of past relationships girl take that off
I start to wonder what new dimension could you be from
The more that comes off you the more attractive you become
Just free yourself from all the drama and the craziness
And baby yes undress from all that daily stress
Don't be self-conscious I just wanna help reveal you
But the best way I can feel you is if you show me the real you
The one's who mind prisms interstate of effortlisms 
Not the one that's putting up those mental defense skepticisms
And as I look at you I see you're physically define
But I'm not try'na strip your body down I'm try'na strip your mind

Strip down queen, come and take that pressure off
Don't be reserved open up let me undress your thoughts
You got the good parts covered up with years of hurt and strive
Throw that on the floor expose yourself to me tonight

It was cool that we have build enough unity
The point where the revealing of her true nudity beautifully included me
I used to be the dude who would use a maneuver foolishy
And ruthlessly persue women until they moved elousively
And then I met you, and knew that there was more too
A woman in the
When you walked into my door your mind was fully closed
Now I need you to disrobed until your fully exposed
Take your time, let it slip off of you bit by bit
You got a wall around you I'm a get rid of that brick by brick
Let's set the music what we do will be exclusive
Not to be intrusive but to remove it is therapeutic
You can do it, I know your whole life you been through it
This conversation were having is fiuld man I knew it
That madness that'chu wearing I need to see it unfasten
Underneath that hurtful fabric what's the woman that I imagine
Come on


Strip down with low self-esteem move away from that
Your natural eyes are beautiful you don't need no colored-contacts
You make the planet turn, we both got a lot to learn
You ain't got no perm but I still love your hair I'm not concerned
Self-doubt emotional scars you just can't take no more
Why you wearing make-up you ain't got no flaws to make up for?
I'm a listen to your problems burn every bad item up
Take off that piece that said ""your skintone wasn't light enough""
No emotional clothes let's get colder than the north pole
Once you parked with those I'm a give you a whole new wardrobe
There she go, look at her she so attractive too me
Look in the mirror, what'chu witnessing is natural beauty",https://genius.com/K-rino-strip-down-lyrics
Meant To Be (Not),Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Oh, man
It's like the hardest thing I've ever had  to do
I can't keep going through this man
I mean, I can't rationalize the situation, just because man
I just got to tell her man
I got to do what I got to do man
Think about the kids man, they got to be in my life man

It seems like we starting to go to war more than average
I feel like I should file for divorce before the marriage
Hate even overrode Quran and Bible significance
I guess that we'll just call it irreconcilable differences
You was like a wish from a magic lamp I dreamed about
But now it's just a nightmare, and I wanna cuss that genie out
No more pillow talk, all we do is scream and shout
Both our words is like poison travelling the intravenous route
At first you couldn't separate us, now it's separate beds
Used to think as one, but now we're back to separate heads
Thought it was fate for me to live that life of make believe
I used to love coming home, now I can't wait to leave
A place once was filled with love now has a vacancy
I'd rather break away than keep living unfaithfully
And Yo, don't get it twisted, this woman was great to me
But now we no longer relate and we both got to face it G

Best of friends, now we're like the worst enemies
We started leaning towards shady and slick tendencies
And I guess that we'll get over it eventually
Sometimes you got to realize it's just not meant to be
Best of friends, now we're like the worst enemies
We started leaning towards shady and slick tendencies
And I guess that we'll get over it eventually
Sometimes you got to realize it's just not meant to be

See, my first test, ask for nothing you'll get everything
Would you love me if I worked the drive-through at Dairy Queen?
Probably not, it seems now you only cherish green
And your demeanor crossed over to that rare extreme
Still hard to let her go despite all the scrutiny
But this being the news and since what time has proved conclusively
How should I do it, give it to her straight and truthfully?
Or should I use that old excuse or speech of 'It's not you, it's me'?
What if I'm wrong, I know neither of us plan to suffer
If we try, maybe there's still some love we can discover
She's a God-loving woman and a champion mother
But for her to try to wear my pants is real manly of her
You know what makes it tougher? Is when your family love her
How can we lay together if we can't stand each other
I had to leave, 'cause it was too much that just can't be covered
I grabbed my keys and did a car dash like (Randy's brother?)

Best of friends, now we're like the worst enemies
We started leaning towards shady and slick tendencies
And I guess that we'll get over it eventually
Sometimes you got to realize it's just not meant to be
Best of friends, now we're like the worst enemies
We started leaning towards shady and slick tendencies
And I guess that we'll get over it eventually
Sometimes you got to realize it's just not meant to be

I came back to tell her we would never merge for ever
Had to step out for a while and get my words together
She pulled a few questionable moves, but my dirt was clever
So as far as men go she's really deserving better
Well I guess we'll both be alone very soon
The sun is gone and there's a dark cloud in every room
Situations more frustrating with every moon
She'll be good, lost love's only a temporary wound
Right? Well at least that's what I'm gonna tell her
I hope that she'll buy this BS that I'ma sell her
Not proud and yet another heart I got to leave in chalk
I grabbed her hand, looked in her eyes and said we need to talk
She shook her head, yes and confirmed entirely
Sat at the kitchen table, looked back at me and said I agree
She said I'm breaking-up with you, this is no longer real
The door bell rang, it was a man, She said ""K this Phil""

Phil?
Like Philip?
What the hell?
You brought him to the house?
Oh my goodness.. It really is over!

Best of friends, now we're like the worst enemies
We started leaning towards shady and slick tendencies

We be in a big rush to do
Nothing
Trying to get to something that
Ain't even there
It's best to fall back sometime man and
Enjoy it for what it is
Watch

Another lonely night, I guess I see it out
Must be a party that nobody told me about
I'm looking at the clock, it's 20 minutes after 9
Frustrated, trying to find some way to pass the time
My telephone haven't rang all day long
Checked the dial tone just to make sure that it still on
Too late to take a walk, that's a crazy choice
Cut on the GPS just to hear a lady's voice
Then sat and listened to a third of my catalogue
It's times like this I wish I had a dog
Maybe I'll watch a game, got happy but not for long
Flipping channels, nothing but news and golf is on

Another lonely night
Nobody home but me
Sitting here all alone
Tried but I just can't sleep
Staring at the walls
Talked to them but they don't talk back
So wait until the new day comes
This is where I belong (oh yeah)

Another lonely night, another night alone
Maybe I'll put a beat on, and try to write a song
It's real quiet in my hood, I ain't hearing nothing
My upstairs neighbor and his wife ain't even fussing
This one female I been ducking for a year flat
Finally called her up, she said, ""I'm busy, can I hit you back?""
Wow! That's when I knew I was in trouble
I done ran through a whole book of crossword puzzles
Feeling lost alone, like a child in a foster home
Times like this man I wish that Bob Ross was on
I'm getting frustrated, I guess I asked for it
Turn on the radio, hell nah, I ain't that bored (never)
I need action like a film director
I'm at the point where I will talk to a bill collector
I haven't spoken to nobody in a minute bro
Can't even go to shoot no ball because the gym is closed

Another lonely night
Nobody home but me
Sitting here all alone
Tried but I just can't sleep
Staring at the walls
Talked to them but they don't talk back
So wait until the new day comes
This is where I belong (oh yeah)

Wish I could go to sleep, it's 3:59
Feel like I watched the same show about 50 times
Yeah the night was slow, just like the night before
But you know what, on the cool, I kind of like it though
(like it though)
Yeah, I kind of like it though
(I like it though)
I kind of like it though

I can get used to this

Line for Line,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"(*talking*)
Just walk slowly behind me, do not break the line
If you break the line, you will be decapitated

I cover many miles of land, by scanning my brain on it
Stand on a beach and barely glance, and counted every grain on it
I can't pops the pressure made, every vein pop
In a storm different forms of me, come in every rain drop
I decline stacking lines, you couldn't give me your rhymes
I see signs of future times, by reading embryo minds
I summon you execution, grown man or grown woman
The psychic that traveled back, and predicted his own coming
New borns and ninety year old, paranoid false rhymers
Memorize my most complex verses, with all finals
Take a verse I've never heard, mix the lyrics you sworn
Take all two hundred words, and put em back in their original form
Like a jigsaw, but yet I do it twice as fast
Slice your mask, the static goes up like the price of gas
I multiply till I'm everywhere, now I'm a main stay
A million different women, gave birth to me all in the same day

Line for line, compared to me you lyrically blind
Line for line, whether written down or straight out the mind
Line for line, one of these 16's or seven and a nine
Line for line, so blind you for it paranormal design

Since way back in the days, from K you heard songs
I write like I was the opposite of left, and the word wrong
I stay the same, but still I keep coming with new trends
You couldn't change me if I was a twenty, and you had two tens
I stun and compress, multiple elements to one
Initiated into the rap game, by pressing my tongue against the sun
I'm making my route, and breaking your clout
Taking you out, with ten strips of duct tape on my mouth
The topic that rock it, from my esophagus was cognitive
Innorogative, even my negativity is positive
Made part holes, by swinging elbows so be wise
A step below hell, the place where Satan goes when he dies
I sever feet with heat deep, and speak of your ever meet
This ain't no birthday party fool, my 16's are never sweet
Wanted to stop me but couldn't, cause I caught you first
I'll dig a clothes hanger in your brain, and abort your verse


Own language I'm feeding, leading to bloody journal reading
Split personality fighting, was the reason for eternal bleeding
The cataclysm, scientists gravitate to my wisdom
Born with a built in, entertainial navigational system
Swallow radioactive lights, and comet media rights
My next two albums already leaked, on futuristic web sites
Words exile style pirates, abolish intolerance
My silence, contains a thousand different methods of violence
My mind games, make it impossible to your non-pain
Verbal octane get a headache, I gave you a migrane
I grow brain, hit warp speed in the slow lane drink propane
Dry your existence out, like a whole century with no rain
Cast out evil, from my cerebral cathedral
Relieve you from human existence, then re-conceive you
I'm so influential, over the people
That if I tell em five plus five is twelve, and you say it's ten they won't believe you",https://genius.com/K-rino-line-for-line-lyrics

I blow over possessed rappers like preacher men do
But instead of an exorcism I'll be putting the demons up in you
You fade the black with no coming back half-human half-bomb attack with a full map of my brain tract in the Almanac
Once I devise your demise, you'll never rise up, I'm a dream
Traveler, so the only way to see me is with your eyes shut
The frequency sailor, interplanetary emailer
Professional carbon monoxide poison inhaler
Entered your head and studied words that you could have read
And I intercepted any murderous lyrics that you would have said

This is Open Thought Surgery
The verses He dispersed and purposely murdered unmercifully
No one is personally worse than me
The atoms that burst in me feed the Earth, the Universe verbally nursing me

I'm the Son of Sam, the ambulance driver saw me and ran
The lyrical vampire who was filmed by your phantom cameraman
Your life is non-recoupable, nothing else I can do for you
I transform from superhuman to marsupial
I speak seventeen conniptions, witnesses gave descriptions
Of non-existent fictitious K-Rino ghost depictions
I ain't seeking love, the action that I'm speaking of caused the weeping of 10 million and left the whole atmosphere leaking blood
Shife on the mic like a devious wife
I won't kill you, I'll just abduct you and hide you in a previous life
I clone hearts when the Twilight Zone starts, I'll imbalance your
Talents and make you allergic to your own thoughts
I stop time, walk in a school room and shot rhymes
Got nine murder cases for popping minds on suicide hotline
And lyrically I'm denouncing men, my head be pounding when
Ancient rap spirits be bouncing in for counseling

This is Open Thought Surgery
The verses He dispersed and purposely murdered unmercifully
No one is personally worse than me
The atoms that burst in me feed the Earth, the Universe verbally nursing me

Listen, the predicament I leave men in was written in pen
They name me valedictorian in schools that I didn't attend
I regurgitate repeatedly at the thought of you, I'll stalk you for life so no matter where you live I already live next door to you
They say I'm sick, I guess that's sort of true, body dissections made sure every family member received a part of you
Ten strains of fluid in my veins were unnameable
What's in my brain will make the self explanatory unexplainable
I'm hard and morbid, dissolving four MCs by putting them all in a boiling cauldron till the world stops revolving
A zone is what I'm stepping in, a body cast is what I left them in, I made a deaf man hear but when he heard you flow he went deaf again
You better make your mortuary reservations
My string of rap murders made a serial killer hand in his resignation
I'm unleashing verbal pestilage
My weaponous method is vocal death manifested through text messages",https://genius.com/K-rino-open-thought-surgery-lyrics
Universal Author,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Just come on in with me
You gotta think about this
You gotta address this
There's no accident

With the overloaded of gifts he bestowed me
Thankful for the mind of the universal author who composed me
In the fold of his protective mode he holds me
Chose me to dwell in his abode as if he owed me
But know he's just gracious and holy
Responsible soley, and out of a dead state, he rose me
Told me too banish the old me
And let the sun cloth me until my roots grow deep at the bold sea
His words and actions are factual
The uncommon is common, and the supernatural is natural
The food is not the start of things the tree is
The process is repeated, the only reason we are is cause he is

Before it becomes physical it's first of thought
Every individual's a work of art
They know he never had to rehearse the part
Nothing that no one else can cause the universe to start

Out of thinking can't compete with his deepness
He feature of every creature born with his own distinct uniqueness
The definition of all know expound my existence
Before my mom knew he formed characteristics
His mind penetrated through time
The infinite song of lives writer who never duplicated a line
The quintessence of every essence
But out of ignorance we question the effectiveness of his methods
You're brain is what he communicates through
And never forsakes you, and then when you sleep at night he takes you
Then later brings you back and awakes you
Let him create you right on your mental chalk board till he elevates you


He study real hard to comprehend
The universal author, who be gunmen with one pen
Of your type you are the only model
The only living copy of your own real life personal novel
And from the very start he can write them
Even when your lights dim you have the capacity to be like him
So even through high stress, believe in progress
You have to master the reason in process
He's touchable like a material thing
He has spirit, but he's not a spiritual being
Not three, not two, one father is true
He's the author of himself and the author of you",https://genius.com/K-rino-universal-author-lyrics
Translation,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"Man, I ain't stupid
Know what y'all mean
When y'all be saying that stuff on TV

Some of the things that they do in America's absurd
Racists and media got a lot of slick code words
Not everybody is able to peep out and discern 'em
So in order for you to recognize you first gotta learn 'em
When you understand the language it's easy to figure
See when they use the word thug, they really saying nigga
Got they hands on the button and they ready to push 'em
When they say terrorists all they really saying is Muslim
They get the air and start testing 'em out
Border patrol simply means keep the Mexicans out
Probation for a murder that don't seem to be right
Troubled teen with affluenza, oh that means that he white
When cops say stop resisting and you not even moving
That's an excuse to justify the brutal tactics they using
News media bias that ain't keeping us quiet
A black peaceful protest gets described as a riot

See we ain't gotta take that though
Can't fool me with your language I'ma break that code
Time to learn what they mean cuz you can't make them love ya
Don't know what they really saying, let me translate it for ya
Bust it up
See we ain't gotta take that though
Can't fool me with your language I'ma break that code
Time to learn what they mean cuz you can't make them love ya
Don't know what they really saying, let me translate it for ya

It's obvious whats happening when you check the comparison
Disagree with US policy, you anti-American
Listen close, to speak facts is to insult
If your organization don't cater to them it's a cult
The condition of the country, blame it all on the hood
Blacks who do crime are no good, white's misunderstood
If you challenge Jewish lies, well that's antisemitism
The word hate is used to describe criticism
Influential insinuations loaded and coded
Disagree with gay lifestyle means you homophobic
Yeah I know it, can't wait to see what happens with this
Investigation of a killer cop means slap on the wrist
We know we ain't have a chance in the first place with 'em
Speaking against discrimination is reverse racism
We hearin' 'em say it everyday but we ain't knowing it
Bring democracy to a country, that means overthrowing it

See we ain't gotta take that though
Can't fool me with your language I'ma break that code
Time to learn what they mean cuz you can't make them love ya
Don't know what they really saying, let me translate it for ya
Bust it up
See we ain't gotta take that though
Can't fool me with your language I'ma break that code
Time to learn what they mean cuz you can't make them love ya
Don't know what they really saying, let me translate it for ya

When they say be grateful, that means to shut up and behave
These days inmates the new word for slave
What about slick talking politicians, remember them?
Democrat and republican are actually synonyms
When they telling you they building, they really destroying
Killings enjoyment, vaccine means poison
Am I tripping or paranoid? It may be me
A slow learner means your child got ADD
So they dope him daily and tell you he crazy
If youre poor and unemployed, oh that means that you're lazy
Gotta watch 'em, cuz their skills are greater than average
If I happen to have a fight, then I'm aggressive and savage
They say police are failing, they out for a killing
Translate suspect, that's a black dude chilling
We just wanna talk to you means they probably blast
""May I help you?"" in the store means I'm watching your ass

See we ain't gotta take that though
Can't fool me with your language I'ma break that code
Time to learn what they mean cuz you can't make them love ya
Don't know what they really saying, let me translate it for ya
Bust it up
See we ain't gotta take that though

No Complaints,Mind Vision,2019.0,"I can't deny the most high I seen to many signs
Blessings seem to come on time right when I'm in a bind
Bad luck does not exist it's only on your mind
Can't whine about your problems if you are not willing to grind
No disputing strong trees come from deep rooting
The only way out of a shooting slump is keep shooting
Everyday my thoughts are rebooting so keep your hatred
Not trying be all face to face with that my peace is sacred
People will try to take it discredit and judge your actions
Some days I lay up in a tub of my dissatisfaction
They laughed at you and you automatically felt defeat (Why?)
Don't let no bodies doubt be stronger then your self-belief
People with greed show behavior that you can't believe
Don't feed your fruit to those who wasn't there to help you plant the seed
Unless they can contribute to your skill homie
And see your vision like you do and help you build on it
(Chorus)
It's not over mayne, (over mayne)
I've got a whole lot on my shoulders mayne, (my shoulders mayne)
Knock me off my game, hell no you can't, (HELL NO! you can't)
Despite my problems I got no complaints
Inside and out the world been whooping me
Not being scared is what it took to be, (took to be what)
Straight up soldiers in these crooked streets (uh)
Can't blame nobody till I look at me, (gotta look at me)
(Verse 2)
""If God is real he wouldn't bring these problems in my house""
When I hear that my question be: ""What God you talkin' about?""
'Cause there's a God who has supreme power no if's or maybe's
Then there's a smaller God who you see in the mirror daily
And that's the one who dropped you in the grease remember
We don't acknowledge what we do to cause our own dilemmas
So we accumulate new set of problems and new foes
You blame the most high for the bad relationships you chose
And when it's time to prove your fate you start lying and rambling
Some people only go to church because the choir be jamming
You showing no spiritual growth just a petty example
Praying for things that you ain't mentally ready to handle
What if you did hit that million dollar lick, surprise me
Would you have the discipline to utilize it wisely?
Sometimes you think you got the world but that's the time you fall
And when you think you got nothing you realize you got it all
(Chorus)
It's not over mayne, (over mayne)
I've got a whole lot on my shoulders mayne, (my shoulders mayne)
Knock me off my game, hell no you can't, (HELL NO! you can't)
Despite my problems I got no complaints
Inside and out the world been whooping me
Not being scared is what it took to be, (took to be what?)
Straight up soldiers in these crooked streets (uh)
Can't blame nobody till I look at me, (gotta look at me)
(Verse 3)
You see what others have and feel you should have had it first
You want to match his possessions but you won't match his work
Was hurting for that cash so you resorted back to dirt
They want it fast so they steal a car, snatch a purse
Some people are ruined and you got a problem being you
Somebody's doing time for something they ain't even do
You got your freedom dude but you not understanding this
Which means what ever stress you have you got a chance to fix
So keep in mind there's some folks having the hardest time
Somebody in the grocery line just got their card declined
And gratitude displays hate in any way you say it
A young lady just lost her child but your baby made it
Relax the patience for the payment but it ain't no rush
Some folks would love to have the life you seem to hate so much
You got a deep mind that's loaded with multiple uses
I'm practicing making daily improvements no excuses
(Chorus)
It's not over mayne, (over mayne)
I've got a whole lot on my shoulders mayne, (my shoulders mayne)
Knock me off my game, hell no you can't, (HELL NO! you can't)
Despite my problems I got no complaints
Inside and out the world been whooping me
Not being scared is what it took to be, (took to be what?)
Straight up soldiers in these crooked streets (uh)
Can't blame nobody till I look at me, (gotta look at me)",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-complaints-lyrics
Pantheon,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Come inside the pantheon
Come inside the pantheon

Over great depths I side step, I expanded my mental biceps
By doing five million rhyme exercise reps
When I'm confronted I lose it, the truth is I concluded
Compared to me perfection needed improvement
See they found the remnants of a man inside a torched van
Terrorized him so bad, after murking him his corpse ran
I post numbers that would please the average sports fan
My smallest thought strand is larger than Otis Thorpe's hand
Now I know just what my shrink means, technology so extreme
I don't need to touch my phone I got a think-screen
Once you see me dementia starts sinking in
Thorns develop in your eyelids, you'll never blink again
The coalition starts swarming ya
The blood and mucus comes once the first thorn is torn through your cornea
The mic metal melts off the reverse suicide killer
Who somehow still murks you after I bump myself off

So come into the Pantheon
Understand, my cranium's a Pantheon
Come into the Pantheon
My cranium's a Pantheon
(Go ahead)

I swing a rhyming belt, to think like me your mind will melt
I'm greater than the greatest of all time because I'm time itself
A mathematically phenomenal when gunning you
I promise you I can pick a number between one and two
Let's talk about my great brain, its frame grows like 'weight gain'
I'll stand in the lane and take a charge for a freight train
You might not want to say my name if you hate pain
I make wind from flames and use the same wind to create rain
My tongue's a bed razor and bristles that release blazing hot missiles
Equal in heat to Capsaicin Crystals
I channel my inner Rambo and handle you with mechanical ammo that will dismantle a man down to the Nano
Then I elevate, lyrically telestrate, quickly regenerate my clever traits
And come back to decimate like Leatherface
Murdering earthlings, prolific word king
As my pen moves with the speed of a Hummingbird's wing

So come into the Pantheon
Understand, my cranium's a Pantheon
Come into the Pantheon
My cranium's a Pantheon
(Go ahead)

They opened me and found a golden key
Right below my left shoulder is a kaleidoscope that holds the globe where oceans be
I'm scary type, I'll be breaking every mic
I'm so great that I can chase you on a stationary bike
Understand I don't bang but I'm dangerous in a raw scuffle
Always keep my hood up as if I was having car trouble
K is cool but my alter-ego's not as nice
Even when I'm mixed up I'm cold as fire and hot as ice
Could out-think a top scholar as a vegetable
See better blind than you could with x-ray spectacles
My head grows at a rate man won't understand
And expands wide enough to snap an equator size headband
Fragment scatter out and on the moon they soon land
Run my fist through your stomach and pulled back a maroon hand
My rap skill is great, points I cleverly score
187 on 2 rappers that's a 374

So come into the Pantheon
Understand, my cranium's a Pantheon
Come into the Pantheon
My cranium's a Pantheon

Why Ya Wanna Hate?,No Mercy,1999.0,"I don't brag about cars and I don't brag about clothes
I don't call women tramps, sluts, bitches or hoes
I don't sell out, kiss ass or ball like a kid
But I bet the radio would bump my shit if I did
You see, I'm standing deep up in your face today
The realest lyricist dropping atomic verses till you waste away
Suckers are tame when I spit the game
Aggravated narrator, metamorphosise into a human flame
Battles intense, never straddle the fence
The radio hating me cause I chose knowledge over nonsense
It's K-Rino in case you don't recognize the tone
I terrorize your zone while my foe dies alone
I do this well while y'all scared to fail
Putting a 100 different fools on your shit to try to make it sell
Killers I'm drafting, cutting snitches in half when
Agitated I'm smashing, do it sound like I'm laughing?
At random, dropping miscellaneous destruction
Causing opponents to suffer spontaneous combustion
Fraud rapper found dead, bucked by the song capper
His tombstone read, ""He fucked with the wrong rapper""

So why y'all wanna hate
When you know that I'ma wreck these fools straight up out the gate
Why you wanna hate
When you know that I'm gonna do them boys twenty times straight?

This magazine wrote they fifty best rappers ever, but brother
That list don't mean shit if I ain't on that motherfucker
Not conceited, I'm straight up convinced that I can rip
My brain emptying verses like killers emptying clips
When he slips, he plummets, 90 feet down to the hole
Blacker than triple darkness, drama, a 100 fold
Shocking electric currents invading the hater's chest
Mad lyrical bullets penetrating the hater's vest
Virtually impossible to analyse the level
Some of these fools' actions be equivalent to the Devil
I'm ripping, clicking that's it, he ripping busting your shit
The wacker these motherfuckers rap the more love that they get
I come straight out my folder with my old school speech
50 rhymes for 10 punks, I crack 'em 5 times each
Close your eyes and make a wish, open 'em up when you're through
But if I'm standing in your face that mean the shit ain't come true
So tell me

So why y'all wanna hate
When you know that I'ma wreck these fools straight up out the gate
Why you wanna hate
When you know that I'm gonna do them boys twenty times straight?

Can I make this situation better before it get tight?
Can I do this motherfucker without taking his life?
Can I get myself in line? Can I just have a sign?
Can I go 24 hours without thinking 'bout dying?
Should I go and bust this faker for the lies that he told?
Should I act like I ain't tripping, then just let it unfold?
Should I check 'em if he bumping, when I know that he fraud?
Can I try to please the people without turning on God?
See I just need me 5 grand so I can turn it to 10
Once I get that 10 grand, then I'm gon' flip it again
If I ever touch that million, they gon' think that I'm through
But them haters gonna be stressing once I turn it to 2
I said them haters gonna be stressing once I turn it to 2
Them haters gonna be stressing once I turn it to 2
Them haters gonna be stressing once I turn it to 2
Them haters gonna be stressing, let them boys know Screw",https://genius.com/K-rino-why-ya-wanna-hate-lyrics
The Revelation,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"A old sage cornered me and adorned me with wisdom in enormous quantities
The next morning he returned and anointed me with clairvoyancy
My carnage couldn’t be harnessed, I bit through steel armory
A cloud of smoke floats where your anatomy stood formerly
When you think about how many rhymes that I have
It makes scientists wonder just how many minds that I have
A deadly scorpion was in my hand but don’t be alarmed
He wasn’t there to do me harm, he was just reading my palm
Volcanic spores coat my throat through every difficult quote
I see the entire galaxy in my peripheral scope
Look in my pupils as I torture you with stinging replies
Use the reflection of yourself to see the fear in your own eyes
Slice your wrists when this omen approaches, my flow is
Loaded with lightning voltage that jolts you like nitrogen narcosis
Your vocab needs practice
I spit words that are harder to pronounce than ingredients on the back of the average food package
Prophecies and tales of distortion
Epic displays of powerful wordplay that reach Herculean proportions
You’re sick like the man who dies and tries to leave with his wealth
When approaching K-Rino, caution proceeds with itself
You get slain in the chambers of pain and sorrow
I stand before you in the present day reminiscing over tomorrow
You’re smitten with autism when bitten
I’m sittin’ over the constellation Orion, memorizing the unwritten
Spittin’ regurgitation for hours without quitting
The giant serpent that was hidden in the womb of a small kitten
Every molecule in existence my mental reflects
I rise and elevate to a point where planets look like specks
In a coma I’m nasty, my own rap pamphlets harass me
Styles harder to do than a blindfolded angioplasty
My impetuous skills are credited to the beneficent
You couldn’t write like K-Rino if you was a forgery specialist
The intricacies of my mental degrees
The raw insidious literary esteem that causes pencils to bleed
I speak black widow, mantis and killer bee
Made one language from all three
And spoke it while I spit a deadly soliloquy
So notice I keep my coldest weapon loaded
So saving his throat is hopeless
‘cause I wrote his eulogy over his epiglottis
Gave him my wickedest read
I only did it because the audience had never witnessed the atmosphere bleed
See I don’t pillage the dictionary to get new words in coherence
To try to give my vocabulary a supernatural appearance
Before we battle, they better clone me ‘cause when I start for you
I’ma be the only person who can pull myself off of you
I graze in a field of thought waves in a grammar maze
Every twenty-seven days I bathe in gamma rays
I breathe poetic wisdom, life granted to men
Like sunlight striking the equator causing the planet to spin
You panic within, in a ceramic bin I hand him his chin
I had amnesia and laryngitis and I still managed to win
I was a spark of light and no force was great enough to create and shape me
So I willed my own parents into existence so they could make me",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-revelation-lyrics
Crhyme Scene,The Maven,2013.0,"I don't know if I'm choking or laughing ahahahahahah
Send your people out!
Send them out!

I'm not concerned with what an Uzi does, I'll leave you in a pool of blood
Like throwing a live shark inside your Jacuzzi tub
They know I'm sick so they just quit, you've got some Toy 'R' Us spit
My verbal thrust kicks could make a bus split
I'm parasitic microfilaria
After tearing the flesh from your bone I show up at another battle wearing ya
My kill 
The scene was so grizzly, cops was asking people if they saw which way the bear went
Strike with permanent 
empowerment
As I slide my body lit between the half inch slits of your air vent
I don't move weight, I smuggle straps
But I do cover maps and pop caps like the air pockets on bubble wraps
My quotes leave approaches with broke knees
Hold them up like trophies and let them soak until they curdle up like goat cheese
MCs matching what I spoke, please?
Telekinetically pulling up oak trees and turning ignitions with no keys

My skill is blinding, really it's a mind thing
Drop a rhyme scheme and make the booth look like a Chryme Scene
Spine tingling verses to show you I'm King
The liquid substance that he regurgitated was lime green

I wrote soliloquies at false heed
My flow seeds grow in your dome piece and cause avalanche nosebleeds
I fly up and push the Sun higher, when I race I wait 'til I'm tired
Lay down on my back and still run right by ya
I'm splashing flames on an average brain
Cut him up on a plane, his slash remains came later on a baggage claim
I speak through a male meter
I feed off aortic vowel walls, of lousy readers like a 

The back flipping rap acrobat
I'll rap for eternity plus 10 additional centuries after that
The pen I'm grabbing, it strikes perpetually accurate
Extracting the yolk out of an egg without cracking it
The institution's most extreme patient
Concentrations so great that I reconstruct a body after cremation
Heathens nurse from my weakened verse
I plant lyric sheets in dirt that burrow deep and burst, disperse and eat the Earth

My skill is blinding, really it's a mind thing
Drop a rhyme scheme and make the booth look like a Chryme Scene
Spine tingling verses to show you I'm King
The liquid substance that he regurgitated was lime green

Connect the dots while I surge you like a breakfast spot
Make your throat swell up so big that your neck just pops
Once I lock you in my thoughts you won't escape my head
The victim bled so much my yellow tape was red

My skill is blinding, really it's a mind thing
Drop a rhyme scheme and make the booth look like a Chryme Scene
Spine tingling verses to show you I'm King
The liquid substance that he regurgitated was lime green",https://genius.com/K-rino-crhyme-scene-lyrics
The Burden Robe,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"There was a man who woke up one day with his heart absent of love
So he went to search for the answer of why that really was
All attempts to learn on his own would eventually fail him
Asked his mother and his father but neither one would ever tell him
He was not young, he was not old, he had been here for a while
And trouble had built up inside of him since he was a child
He met a guy who then told him, even though he didn't know him
And informed him of an old man with the understanding to show him
His inner demons was starting to eat right through him and defeat him
So he quickly made preparations to locate him and meet him
He was already questioning whether or not he would believe him
So he just thought to himself I guess I'll find out when I see him

So much trouble on my shoulders now, every day a new weight
I should've been a better man but now I think is too late
I have to pull my mind back from the darkness to a true place of light, before this burden overtakes me

He showed up a the man's home, hoping he wasn't a faker
He walked up to the door and checked the address on the paper
He was kind of apprehensive because they told him to come alone
And as he lifted his hands to knock the door just opened up on its own
And the old man appeared and said, ""How may I assist you?""
He said I heard that you can lift my burdens. He said, ""It's true""
He called him closer grabbed him by the shoulder, gripped it tight
And in his mind he now could vision every aspect of his life
Then he stepped into the light, the garment he wore was exposed
It was a robe that looked as though it was five centuries old
He said, ""If you put this on then your children will fall below you""
He said 'I don't have any children' He said, 'Yes you do I'll show you'


The old man said this robe I'm wearing, is no regular robe
It exposes past emotions and reasons never been told
When you were five years old you were Parsimonious indeed
And that Selfish mind married Lust and gave birth to Greed
Then Greed grew up to gain much, but was a lonely one
Till he met Hate who gave birth to Pain their only son
And Pain consummated with Envy from night time till the morn
And two more children Disloyalty and then Murder were born
And you fathered them all and let each of these spirits drown you
And Love, Trust and Compassion were not allowed to be around you
So now you stand before me crying imploring for help
Asking me to lift the sadness you inflicted on yourself
Then the old man took the robe off and his heart began to soften
The stress erased from his face and his grey began to darken
Then he placed it on the man's back and the man began to lose it
It was uncomfortable, heavy and impossible to remove it
The old man said I wore this for fifty years, it wasn't easy
But you coming to see me took it off my back and freed me
So to wipe out the regret and hurt you feel there's only one way
You'll have to wear this robe till someone like you finds you one day

There's a lesson in this, for all of us
The things we do stay with us for years
Till we cleanse them from our internal self
In other words get them demons out your heart man",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-burden-robe-lyrics
Death Of A Politician,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"You got your face too close to miss, if you feel you're supposed to diss
Get a dose of this verbal explosiveness
I'll post a list, kill the most when pissed
Swing a closed fist till nothing but ghost exist
See I’m brown skin and they found ten
Prejudiced dead men, blood’s what they drowned in
Rounding up all they asses like they did us
Whoop ‘em and hide them away like they hid us
Damn, I should have had a V8 so I could see straight
Into the Devil’s eyes and relate before I create
Destruction, corruption, positive, negativity so stay up
I start downtown and work my way up
With judges coming with racial grudges
Throw my body in jail but my brain never budges
‘Cause it’s mandatory that I never lose position
‘Death of a Politician’

Death of a Politician, Death of a Politician
All fingers pointed to South Park Coalition
Death of a Politician, Death of a Politician
All fingers pointed to South Park Coalition

Scaling a rough twelve stories high
With a glass cutter and a nine strapped to my thigh
Taking care of business, on assignment with the mission
Searching through the files of a global politician
No more petitions or bitching ‘cause you won’t listen
From miles away you hear my missiles start whistling
Lay your ass down, back down, face up
The South Park version of you getting your ass laced up
Any sudden moves and I’m cutting off your thumb
Blood pours, hand goes numb, it’s now dumb with no function
Conjunction junction, Dope-E’s up to something
Terrorist attack, your attack malfunction
Ya suckers, everything you tell the public is a lie
Suckers, you set the system up for my people to die
Ya suckers, punk, that’s why I’m dissing
Revolutions start and your ass come up missing

Death of a Politician, Death of a Politician
All fingers pointed to South Park Coalition
Death of a Politician, Death of a Politician
All fingers pointed to South Park Coalition

It all starts with a hidden threat, I’m getting set to hit and jet
But first I watch him sit and sweat
Because it’s been highly publicized
That at the next press conference a city official dies
I send notes and notes of evil quotes
Pictures of black hands around racist throats
Pictures of black families living in poverty
Regular reasons related to riots and robbery
Yo, use protection when checking my section
‘Cause once I catch him, there’ll be no election
‘Cause just like a crooked preacher who wrecks his fate
You’re passed to brothers like a fucking collection plate
So, here’s the game plan, it’s tight so listen
All of a sudden your five-year-old is missing
So meet me at the railroad track
And bring eighty grand if you want the little bastard back
I knew he wouldn’t come alone
So I had Dope-E behind a building, aiming his chrome
And when he crosses, I’ll end my mission
Dead cop, dead child, ‘Death of a Politician’

Death of a Politician, Death of a Politician
All fingers pointed to South Park Coalition
Death of a Politician, Death of a Politician
All fingers pointed to South Park Coalition

Rain and holocaust tear opponent down
Direct result when I’m in concert throwing down
Power fist in the air raised high
The Devil steps up, you swing it down on the eye
And there’s no need for you to rush the stage
I cock my rhyme back and bust my gauge
Minimum wage, another term for slave
Recaptivate our land and put the Devil in his cage
Rage and anger
To the white man’s god who they say lay in the manger
In the nine trade, the government’s in danger
Caught in middle white lies, ‘cause state of story changes

War In South Park,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Yo, there was a war in South Park
Two o'clock in the daytime the sky was dark
No joke, I'm running through black smoke and dirt
Saw Point Blank on MLK looking hurt, he said..

Dope fiend set me up
Now I'm backtracking myself to see where I done fucked up
At, K-Rino, get the gat for me
I don't think I got the nuts, I want you to dispose of me

Blank, you better think before your life crumbles
What you want me to tell Nip? (On a fear, no trouble)
Aight, man, let's get this shit straight
What tool should I use?

I prefer the .38 to the dome cause to bad dreams I'm prone
I'm tired of this world, Lord I'm ready to come home
I can't handle it, I'm so afraid I might damage it
So I drop to my knees and use it to my advantage
K, it's funny to think I was making a lot of money
Fell in love with dollar signs and I guess it growed on me
But in reality I fucked up a lot of minds
Destroyed braincells, now I'm losing mine
I'm on the edge and I'm 'bout to jump off
So I'mma sacrifice myself and take it as a loss
It was was hard to choose but I chose the bullet
K, you supposed to be my nigga, now pull it 

Yo, so I bailed out and my pace sped
Running full speed while my chest and my face bled
Death Busy didn't know exactly
Who I was cause he charged me with his gun pointed at me
Saying:

Boy, what the fuck is wrong with you K, thrusting up on me like that?
But aiyo, take this TV, Eyque's parked in the back
Boy you be flipping on all the shit
We'll have so much shit I'll have an entertainment centre in my bathroom
I heard explosions, screams and shootings
We ran here for ammo, saw keyboard pianos and ended up looting
Perfect timing like Rain Man and my main man
Came up with a game plan to steal that van, you coming or what, man?

So we ran to a shack, ten brothers broke us down with a sneak attack
From trying to fight them off, I felt a bone of my fist cracked
They tied us to some dynamite, I thought we would lose out
Till Murder1 came and blew the fuse out

Murder One fear no danger
My main lady, the 380 taking out motherfuckers
Hanging in South Park car watch me and Guess
Some young punk pulled a gun to Guess' chest
(Then what happened?) I remember I was packing
I felt like Clint Eastwood but smiling while I'm capping
Yo, you know how the story goes
Money, women, cars, booming system, ______ and foes
See, like trouble follow me
Another funeral, another brother made history
A cop came and accidental
A gunshot, I looked up, it was A.C. Chill

Gunfire, gun smoke, motherfucker's neck broke
But I be fucking face he choke
In South Park it gets dark, I find a sharp dart
So I stuck it in a fool's heart
Cause they tried to blow my hood up
But as fast as they step up I gotta light their ass up
And that was why and still why
I had to let motherfuckers live, now I gotta let them die
Because it's my responsibility
To shoot a motherfucker in the face if he fuck with me
A.C.'s the name you should remember
Cause I can make it hot as fuck, middle of December

So we jumped on the back of A.C. Chill's truck
Riding full speed and both of the wheels stuck
Time to pack up, load the Mac up
Went to Hiram Clarke and scooped Greek for some back-up

The only one drafted from hard hitting Hiram Clarke
Strapped, under my arm is a rabies infested shark
Jumped in the truck, now we headed back to South Park
It's up to me to keep this shit from spreading to Hiram Clarke
Made out a plan to stop every man in cold blood
Cop in a ____ stand drowning in the rhyme blood
Riding down Reed Road, that's when we seen them coming, shit
Nothing but lip syncers, we slaughtered their ass quick
Synchronized my watch to see how fast I can be, quick
To go against the Greek they got the mind of a flea tick
Try by the mic and die by the mic says it all
My last words with eighty gats pointed at me, ""Fuck y'all!"" 

K.O. was knocking out suckers
Nip was jumping off buildings clothes-hanging motherfuckers
I told them both to run fast
The terrorists showed up with both their faces in one mask
Grimm and Egypt-E showed up
They rode up in their ride, hit the breaks and it blowed up
Some suckers tried to get some
Here come The Beholder, I told him to bring the bomb

K-Rino, you know I got 'em
So let's beat 'em down and drop them cause I don't give a fuck about 'em
As I stalk the streets of South Park
I'm ripping rappers apart cause dead men don't talk
You up against a bad guy who's up to no good
And this man wears a hood
So when I step up, step back
Cause I'm fully prepared to go all out cause I'm all that

I ran over to a phone to call C-Rock
Stepped in the booth, tried to break but the door was locked
Yo, and the place filled with gas, Ganksta Nip broke the glass
And pulled me out before it choked my ass

What's up, K? What's up with you?
The seven serial psychopath South Park psycho to the rescue
You aight? Wake it up
And just for that I finna start fucking the country up
Piece by piece, a limb by limb
The night is dim, to live chances are very slim
Ganksta Nip, the Lord of Darkness
Now I lay me down to sleep in my holy South Parkness",https://genius.com/K-rino-war-in-south-park-lyrics
Razor Sharp,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"Once the lyrics hit you, they split you into pixels
I reconfigure and mix you beyond any possibility to fix you
I play innocent but I'll rip you
And no one will believe the vicious pit bull got swallowed by a
Shih tzu
It wouldn't pay to respond to K
I'm waiting on a day one of these sissy rappers come on stage in lingerie
Cause that's the moment I'ma bomb and spray in such a monstrous way
Your conscious state will look Pompeii on a normal day
On the floor is where your arm will lay, detached after ___ fray
And now with one remaining how is he gonna pray?
My name brings the exact same thing
As dopamine in the brain mezzanines of cocaine fiends
See I'm 8.2 massive when I'm passive
And crafted to run past your fastest speed if my max mass molasses

But all the jealously fellas be levelling at me is sold separately
I find and lease a hundred styles a week
I'm obviously deep because I watch over my own body while I sleep!
CDs are rare commodities, I'm ending rivalries
By squashing so called MC prodigies to cottage cheese
Take over your head life meth do, there's absolutely no rescue
From the depths of my intellectual cesspool
The exit prove too retched to get through
I can help you recollect respective life events when I've never met you
I'm raw when dissing but they hardly listen
Send a search party wishing to find you and now the search party's missing
Your heart I'm hitting first causing it to burst
My applausable work lets me move forward in reverse
It will take a while for me to break and smile
Plus I'm making hateful styles  that hurt like an Incredible Hulk flagrant foul

Only in the Hood,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Only in the hood, only in the hood
Only in the hood, only in the hood

Only in the hood, come see it in person
5 cars in the yard man, one of them working
At night it can get truely, rowdy and unruly
Can’t go to the store without some dude tryna sell you a movie
One day in 3rd ward, what I saw made me pause
A 10 speed with a baby seat hooked on the handlebars
And even at a funeral, they still couldn’t get past it
Buried their homeboy and put a swinger on his casket
Tripping in the wrong hood is gonna be hard to leave out
Mess around and catch your pastor coming out the weed house
Lights got turned off but we still getting it in though
'Cause my neighbor let me run an extension cord up through his window
These girls got it locked down, hustle game crazy
3 dudes paying child support on the same baby
Boyfriend/girlfriend, met and fell in love
Got married and had their wedding in the after-hours club
Where?

Only in the hood, only in the hood
If you never been around it then this won't be understood
Gotta keep it G for my partners and homegirls
Born and bred since a youngster, wouldn't trade it for the world
Only in the, only in the, only in the hood
Only in the, only in the, only in the hood
Only in the, only in the, only in the hood
If you never been around it then this won't be understood

Wholesale hustling, listen I’ll say it louder
At the intersection selling fake persons and washing powder
Bought this dude a chicken basket, he was hungry, let him tell it
Soon as he got it, he in the parking lot tryna sell it
See everybody’s hustling, everybody got a stunt
10 year old children talking about, “Let me hit the blunt”
Girl ain’t even got a license but she still gonna make it pop
Doing hair in her apartment like she own her own shop
Now, you don’t think that it’s real? Homie you might get killed
10 o'clock at night, baby outside on the big wheel
Gotta watch these fellas 'cause they real funny, trust me
Tryna sell a sick 10 year old pimp like he a puppy
This boy ain't even crazy but he faking for a check
He got a tattoo of a pistol and a drink cup on his neck
Baby girl worked a month out of the year, she ain't concerned
Claimed some kids that wasn’t hers and got a fire rack tax return

Only in the, only in the, only in the hood
If you never been around it then this won't be understood

Now let me bring this to the light, you know that you ain’t right
Spraying that black stuff on your hair to make your hairline look tight
We ain’t have no real jerseys when we played our opponents
Just a plain white t-shirt with the numbers drawn on it
Little mama had a fight up at the club, she got it cracking
Picked her hair up off the ground took it home and sewn it back it
Dinner time in the hood, everybody in the spot ate
Gas turned off, we cooked the whole me on a hot plate
Don’t worry about that check fam, somebody gon’ cash it
Doing ghetto gymnastics on a dirty ass mattress
Still selling cool cups, music’s still screwed up
Old school dudes slanging weed out the food truck
Everybody in the hood, packed up in the church
I just wish for one Sunday that the air condition worked
And when it’s said and done, through the drama, through it all
We don’t trip and we ain't scared and we still don't like the laws

Swag Killer,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Swag? Haha! Here we go

Snatch 'em up and let's throw 'em in trunks
Everywhere I turn my head dudes is lookin' like punks
You keep wearing all them tight shirts, your chest might crack
Listen fool; grown men ain't supposed to dress like that
And what's up with them stockings that you trynna wear?
Got strong ass pretty boy dyin' his hair
They say there ain't no men that teach boys, they fadin' out quick
I hope you didn't have a daddy, cause if so he need his ass kicked!
I'm in the spot, hoping to see mics breakin'
Then you jump up on the stage with all that bouncin' and shakin'
This might be the wildest thing there ever was in the world
I seen a rapper twerking one time and it wasn't a girl
Just accept your manhood fool, your life could improve
You a 32 year old dude with lights on your shoes
And if I tell him move around he got the right to refuse
But they gonna see me charged with offing him that night on the news

Cause I'm the Swag killer
The Swag-the Swag killer
I'm the Swag killer, the Swag the Swag killer
I'm the rapper tap killer, add body bag zilla!

I'll run you off the block, weather it's your fault or not
You need to get a 3X man, your shirt look like a halter top
Yeah man, I know we supposed to be brothers
But on your album cover, why y'all stand so close to each other?
I might roll up to your residence, kick in the doors
Thought I was in your little sister's room, turned out it was yours
I'm ready to come and show you what my whole team 'bout
Grab a pair of grip pliers and snatch your nose ring out
They could probably swim across that blood river you made
I'mma shave that relaxer off your head and give you a fade
You a star, so you in the photo-shoots with photographers
I ain't never seen gangster rappers use choreographers
You're corny and you're basic, plus your image is childish
Makes me wanna beat the hell out of you and your stylist
Police can't even save you when I'm doing my damage
Ring the grease out of your hair then go fry me a fish sandwich

Cause I'm the Swag killer
The Swag-the Swag killer
I'm the Swag killer, the Swag the Swag killer
I'm the rapper tap killer, add body bag zilla!

You in Hollywood with no local or out of town fans
Ain't nobody at the shows but you and the sound man
Now you standin' hear explainin', trying not to get crushed
But we can't have this conversation 'til you wipe off that blush
See I've been blessed with realness, tried and hood-tested
And you should be arrested for them pictures in your press kick
Not the one to be messed with, cause I'm much worse
Your clothing line ain't nothing but a dozen airbrushed shirts
I'mma burn your wardrobe from your socks to your collar
How you gonna make it rain and try to go pick up your own dollars?
Lookin' like a clown matters if you get paid stacks
Climbing out of a limousine wearing them 9th grade slacks
In front of masses, I'm teaching daily Swag-less classes
Silly asses walking around with no lens in they glasses
I got a surprise for all these feminine guys
Run up on stage and snap them contacts out 'ya eyes

Uh!
Y'all should of knew this day was coming
We bout to get back G wit' it in H-Town, man
And all around the world
(Chorus)
I'm so confused
I can't tell the chicks from the dudes
I'm confused
I can't tell the chicks from the dudes
I'm so confused
I can't tell the dudes from the chicks
'Cause they walking around the city wearing the same outfits

Man, I thought you was a thug, certified wig splitter
Now you with your girlfriend picking dresses all griller
If you call yourself a gangster you might wanna reconsider
Purchasing that pink shirt with them studs and that glitter
Females is getting hard while dudes is getting soft
While he tryna let his hair grow she cutting hers off
If you think you looking fly well that's your interpretation
Meanwhile that tight shirt is cutting off your circulation
You so fly that it's scary, I can't say it no clearer
In the bathroom with your wife fighting over the mirror
Y'all have switched up the game for real
Tell me what's the biz
Don't no women want a man who think he's cuter then she is
Fools taking bubble bath with aroma therapy candles
And if I see another dude wearing some sissified sandals
Talking bout they so comfortable, the air keeps the heat off
I'm a catch 'em by himself ambush 'em and chop his feet off
(Chorus)

These cats sweeter than glaze, man I hope it's just a phase
It didn't even reach this stage back in the El DeBarge days
I done let it ride too long so now they gots to pay
How you gangster and you smelling like feminine body spray
Man, I'm tired of all these pretty rappers bragging about swagger
I'm a tag you with a jab that'll make a bull stagger
If the sun hit ya process your hair will probably melt
I can't believe you came around here wearing that superhero belt
I can't see you fitted like this masculine I'm maybe blind
Plus I thought jheri curls went out of style in 89
Do you dress like this to meet a girl and get on your jock
I like Michael Jackson too but ain't no glitter on my socks
For this punk trend to end, I just gotta hope and plead
Boy you're high maintenance like a janitor smoking weed
Born to lead 'cause I'm bred from a gangster ass breed
Straight up OG, product of a gangster ass seed
(Chorus)

Real G's are becoming extinct like polar bears
These boys be wearing clothes a lotta women wouldn't wear
You was a Rasta mon, dreaded up blowing in the air
Now your whole hair is relaxed telling people it's baby hair
Man, I know a lot of streets you better never walk on
This dude is in the club with canary scarf on
With them flamboyant jeans looking like they from the 80s
Cell phone rung, his ringtone was ""All My Single Ladies""
Your shirt is lime green, your shoes is suspect
Your face is moisturized, your hair passing your neck
Nothing wrong with getting fly, but nah, not like these folks
'I'm Forever' t-shirts, sweats, Nikes and black Loc's
Where you get them shades from?
Man, you elegant as a swan
At the Chinese nail salon getting your feet done
Some of y'all need gangster rehabbing and pimp slaps

They tryna channel negativity through you, yeah
They mad 'cause you're doing good
So don't give 'em no energy
Come on

To artificial entities, I give no energy
I move transcendently, to kill is the remedy
Every time you striving, they setting out to stain you
The ultimate aim of their presence is to drain you
Poisoning your dreams, planting doubt in the brain of you
To try to make you feel like your goals are unattainable
They concentrate on your short-comings and try to surface 'em
Then they judge your life like they're living the perfect one
Hypocritical is the only label that fits you
They privately slander then smile when they with you
They stone you and never have a dollar they can loan you
Same ones that crown you, be the ones to dethrone you
The way a man or woman can hate on a friend
Is the only thing that real people can't comprehend?
Heart's rusty, I always prove that you can trust me
They must be out to persecute me unjustly
It hits like a venomous bullet that never miss us
They slip in your ear with slick sinister whispers
In all that's a part of it, your spirit's absorbing it
They rob you of ideas and act like they thought of it
They take minds and bruise 'em, it's deep envy that rules them
The truth is that energy that you're giving 'em fuels them
So when they have nothing to turn out, they burn out
Hater block and got 'em in trans like they was shurned out
Hell would you let somebody tell you
That you could never excel when everything they ever did fall through?
We dwell in positive elements
And deposit intelligence and never judge you for past closeted skeletons
Hate I don't need it, I can't see it or read it
You can bring that bacon to me, but I'm not gon' eat it
You can beat it, these heathens made it hard to keep achieving
To win the ring you gotta start grinding in pre-season
But while you're grinding don't nag about timing
And remember it's a thin line between venting and whining
That's it, I hope it's sinking in as I'm spitting it
'Cause if God got something for you who stop you from getting it
No energy

Don't give 'em no energy mayne

What up Melo, what up Chucky?

Two Sides to the Story,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"(K-Rino)
The last thing that I've remembered I was reading a book
I was standing in the corner store just waiting in line
Woke up laying on the gurney disoriented and shook
A young gangsta walked in the door holding a nine
Five shadows stood over me one read me the rules
He left one worker in the closet bound and gag
The other four dispersed then started grabbing surgical tools
He told the cashier to clear the rack and fill up the bag
I felt heavily sedated but still I was scared
He was driving a black Coop parked out front of the place
Wanted to talk but my ability to speak was impaired
He did a double take and came back when he looked at my face
A laser lacerated my skull but I felt no pain
He ran out and smashed the gas like he was trying to break it
A tube drained and extract the chemicals from my brain
I untie the dude and bailed out just happy to make it
Out-of-body experience my conscience withdrew
The cops showed up my mind still be playing the images
I'm watching them operate on me from an overhead view
They questioned me before I was able to exit the premises
Seconds later I was home still feeling an anesthesia
Of course yo boy didn't say nothing though they question me well
I don't know what they did but I was weakened by the procedure
Besides that they had masks on so it was nothing to tell
Somebody's beating on my front door it's my girl in a rage
When I went back to the hood I ain't mention the heist
Crying asking me where I been cuz she ain't seen me in days
The boys had already found out the previous night
I gave her a roll of tissue and said ""What's your issue?""
I got a call on my house phone a block number at noon
""What the hell you mean days? I just hung out with you!""
They said ""I know you talked to the laws, man I'll get with you soon.""
As we debated I felt weaker so she sat beside me
Before I could explain they hung the phone up quick
She said ""We talked last Tuesday K, today is Friday.""
Now I'm a target in my own hood for no reason I'm sick
I said ""Yeah, Tuesday the 25th is the date""
Well if it's war then I guess it's gon be war that's the biz
But when I checked my calendar it said Friday the 28th
The worse part was not knowing who the enemy is
I sent her home still trying to account for the lost time
I withdrew from everybody even family and friends
The experience I had instantly cross my mind
I'm trusting no man or woman the paranoia kicks in
Later that night I went to sleep and one or two hours in
I'm tripping hard staying up all night stressed out
I found myself in the process of being abducted again
Jumping every time I hear a strange sound in the house
They repeated the same process and entered my head
Should I move? Change my number? I don't know what to do
But this time somehow I heard every word that they said
My mama let me know that they been calling her house too
One of them said ""This is the last session."" and typed in a code
Could this be real, or this somebody joking or bluffing?
And inserted a blue microscopic cranial probe
If I could just let them know that I ain't tell the police nothing
As I struggled to talk the monitor started blinking
One week after the robbery I'm just chilling at home
And on the screen was printed out every word I was thinking
Scared to put my people in this so I'm mobbing alone
I thought ""Why?"" as my body laid in stabilization
Somebody knocked on my front door so I looked through the blinds
One of them said ""We need your brain waves to produce our nation.""
Whatever gon happened I'm ready for it now is the time
""Our civilization's endangered that's why we have you here""
I snatched the door open but didn't recognize this man
""We been abducting you on and all for the last two years.""
He was with two dudes one of them had some gloves on his hands
""We duplicated your whole mind the entire infinite tree.""
I said ""Let me tell you what happened, and please refrain...""
""Our people breathe thru intellect not physical intimacy.""
""If yall gon take me out at least give me a chance to explain.""
I said ""Man if I could save a whole planet then let it be.""
They said, ""It's nothin to explain, homie, we already know.""
""Especially if their mental propensity is like me.""
""It's all good, I'm the young G that robbed the store.""
They emerged from the shadows a princess and a prince
And even though you couldn't see my face you still didn't rat
They sent me back home that second and I ain't heard from them since
We used the cash to flip a bigger lick here's ten G's black..
Hook 2x
Now if you heard every thing I said and you still confused
About the direction I was going and the style that I used

He cast a rhyme so asinine
I blasted in his anatomical mass in a particle spread to fast to find
My words seem to cause internal eczema
Every night I dream a different vindictive anathema
Master of range in a extra concepts kept on a hanger
Your remain up in a catacomb of a subterranean chamber
The raps I read carry parasitic flees
That burrow beneath the flesh of emcees lay eggs and hatch and rebreed
I'm the solar light that illuminates softer than lunar
In others words my minds the Sun, the Moon's the mind of the consumer
You're gossiping you're incompetent, blueprints are stopping
It's like a theory of the big bang of a posterous hypothesis
Rapid words have cased with soft veered verbs in case we missed
You see me collects dust like the bible in the home of a atheist
The syllable scientist, look what my mind has done
The skill of organizing three words just to rhyme with one
See you can trace my deep metaphysics back to the late 80s
When I speak the moisture I see the high trade Hades
My organs are made of brass so it's nothing to drink gas
I throw a flame and asteroid at you and tell you to think fast
Thoughts snatched within like a feminine who was snatched from the masculine
I'm in ya medicine cabinet injecting headaches into your aspirin
If it's true you gotta lose before you learn how to win
Then I pass without taking a class and you taking it again
My strenuous creative process, regiments and grind
Continuous lines compressed in badder measurements of time
I'll test you on every style once and all in nuances
Only the best responses get scholarships to my conscious
My university ain't what you picture it to be
Because it takes a whole millennium just to get your degree
Your final exam takes place in a parallelogram
Where even the meeble fetuses know who the hell I am
I'll imprison you between blindness and sight
In between gravity and space and between darkness and light
In between non-existence and conception
In between death and reincarnation, between real and reflection
Elation and depression, breathing and being breathless
Between hydrogen and two counts of oxygen with no wetness
In between a beast and humanity
In between the sane mind and insanity, self-hatred and vanity
In between consciousness and dreaming
In between the X and Y chromosomes of a futuristic being
In between righteousness and sin
And a million other dimensions that are impossible for a man to be placed in

If we on the same team how come you tackling me?
No need to answer, that was rhetorical, telling historical (lies) sick from the thought of you why, actions are horrible
Pop your sister and brother then cover it up

See some of y'all ain't gonna move till your ass gets hit
Some of y'all ain't gonna move till your ass gets hit

Come with that wack talk, you get packed off the asphalt
Ma, this year I had to cut a lot of cats out
Firecracker ass in the mouth, ready to blast out
You ain't down, we're snatching that fake poppa mask off
And it's sad man, you don't wanna know where my cash ranks
My tolerance is low like the average ghetto gas tanks
And they already said the violence in the music is influencing you to shoot em, you might as well do it
Get you, apprehend you, take you down to the jail
All of a sudden now you dangling in your cell
Check it, the whole world hate this is country we in
So if you join the army we probably won't see you again
I'm with the gangsters, the NOI and my Mexican pals
Ain't nobody paying attention to Jesse and Al
Same puppets that was calling for the National Guard
To mob through ya hood and snatch your ass out your yard


See, the body cam didn't save Sam
The racist pig didn't give a damn, pulled his gun and blam blam
Shot him in the head, tried to speed away but DOA
Then the other pigs came and asked the cop was he OK
See, that's the kind of dirty ass stuff we see today
What can you tell his family, far be it for me to say
We can pray, protest, hoping these people pay
But the judges are gonna exonerate him either way
You tripping over rap beefs and caught up in fashion
And who's smashing the Kardashian, the art of distraction
Where the drink, where the 'dro at, big talking and flashing
But when some real shit happen you never part of the action
When they hear you bragging about ya past swingers, they laughing
Cause they own the same property you sitting in trapping
Kill your enemy, don't love him, best lesson I ever had
And when a dirty cop get his blasted, I'm never sad",https://genius.com/K-rino-talk-like-this-lyrics
I Ain’t Bitter,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"I'm good

Let me set the record straight and I'ma speak it precisely
When it comes to writing G it ain't nobody like me
Not many in history can wreck on a beat
Think deep and teach and still connect with the streets
I'm that dude they never let spit and this is a fact
'Cause I'm known for gettin' on tracks and peelin' em back
Melt em like plastic 'cause see I bring heat to their asses
Half sleep when I listen to them weak mic passes
Bet the world sayin, ""Damn, that's the best they got?""
""They never put you on them songs"", Hell nah they'd better not
When I finish with the booth it's a thousand degrees
They can't breath, they be even scared to spit when I leave
I'm on another plane, none of 'em can go past that
Million dollar rappers scared of a broke ass cat
That's how dirty that my murderous words be
I don't blame 'em, if I wasn't me I'd be nervous too if I heard me

They say they never heard of me, I know they lyin' so quit
'Cause I can hear my damn style every time they spit it
I'm the prime example of how to climb the mantle
And trample minds 'til your lifeline is cancelled
Most emcees are overrated and some of 'em weak
I'm an inhabitant of levels that none of 'em can reach
Y'all better see, it's obvious there'll probably never be
A novelist who can write plots and describe 'em as cleverly
But most of the rappers now be coonin' for deals
I heard ten year olds that got more complex skills
They the kind that nobody would remember in time
It's like they building these rappers on an assembly line
Copyin' others ain't mandatory, clown, it's a choice
They imitate 'em from their clothes to the sound of their voice
Stealing from me and walking around like I ain't able to spot it
If you gonna jack at least be real enough to say where ya got it
Please

Every year it's like the arrogance seems to increase
I exceeded your catalog with a single release
I'm a mercenary, I'll never be rapping like them
You the guy that people ask ""What ever happened to him?""
Y'all need to learn how this whole Houston thing went down
It don't matter if you was born here or from outta town
Let me make it real clear so you simps can adjust
Your little write ups ain't complete if you ain't mentioning us
Your documentaries, your books about H-Town talent
If S.P.C ain't in it then the shit ain't valid
We shuttin' down the inside and outside field
You tryna tell me I can't live in the house I built
We gonna ban ya from the city or leave ya gushing
So don't fake when ya see me just keep on pushing
I ain't living in the past off of quotes that I said
But my first album is still over most of ya heads",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-aint-bitter-lyrics
Suicide Note,Ten Year Run (1993-2003)  (Compilation),2003.0,"To whom it may concern, I apologize for everything I've done
And all the trouble that I caused, all my humanistic flaws
And the problems I've probably put all my people through
Inner peace was unattainable, the pain was unexplainable
Too deep for you, I'm sitting here wearing a suit never been worn
Blaming myself for world problems, wishing I'd never been born
In a state of deep depression, for my soul ain't no lifting
Flashing back about life about moves I would have made different
I heard it said that taking your own life is selfish
And never dealt with what I dealt with, struggle to felt this helpless
It's my life, so I choose whether to cancel or save
But on the other hand what right do I have to take something that God gave
I'm pretty sure there's some people in the grave that died young
That would love to still be in the game with breath inside lung
But I'm sorry to disappoint them huh but in all modesty
I'm about to terminate my policy and end this odyssey

How shall I kill me, let me count the ways
I've been devising and contemplating murder methods for days
Should I take a bottle of pills, drift off and never wake up
Thrust myself from a bridge and break up my bodily make up
Should I prop my back against the wall and pop my gat
To forcefully extract exploding brain material or visit Doctor Jack
To get a lethal dose of arsenic, injected in my heart, causing it
To pause when high poison gets off in it
But then again another killing plan that I'm feeling, man
Is to rope my neck then stand on a chair then dangle from the ceiling fan
Or take some gas since expiration is fast, heads thrown
But now I'm about to make my own future the past tense
So I'ma write this note and leave this Earth
But by the time y'all read this I can see that tryna save me' will be needless
'Cause yesterday I felt terrific, but the world is wealth addicted
Injected depressive thoughts, now my wounds are self-inflicted

In my room, my mind made up, no chance for survival
Past suicidal, on my bed is a Quran and a Bible
But it's too dark to read 'cause all I've got is a candle lit
I can't handle it, phone been ringing all night but I ain't answered it
Huh, I got my Sam Cooke CD on
About to satisfy all the snakes and hypocrits who wanna see me gone
That's when I turn the TV on
And I noticed the needy woman living on the streets with 2 children, without a home
Watching the news, I see a lady breaking down
For a chalk line on the ground where her sons body was found
Eliminated by a bullet from a cops gun
I'm witnessing wars where bombs killed inoccent people when they drop one
And folks appreciate life for what it is
And little kids laughing just made me realsie I wanna live
Now I'm grateful for my life and every breath I ever took
Now I can fold this letter up and place it in my Black Book",https://genius.com/K-rino-suicide-note-lyrics
It Don’t Matter,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"What up, queen. I just wanna let you know to not ever let nobody bring you down. No matter what your condition is, where you at in your life, what happened to you or what you goin’ through, what they said you couldn’t be, people callin’ you out your name, the only thing that’s important is how God sees you. Remember that

It don’t matter what other people think of you
It don’t matter the situations you’ve been through
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna give you love, it’s not my place to judge
It don’t matter, what you got or what you have
It don’t matter, the things you did in your past
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna show you some love, it’s not my place to judge

You have a crown, whether small or packin’ some extra pounds
Whether dark skinned, light skinned, , yellow or brown
How you keep holding it down is still so hard to believe
Natural hair, long hair, short perm, dreads or weave
So many diverse versions of a queen that it’s striking
You could be working a 9-to-5 or straight house-wifing
Single mother, married, one deep or not ready to settle
Living in a simple home, mansion, apartment, the ghetto
All of you are equally special so your worth should be known
Young or grown, a few stretch marks or you’re perfectly toned
Stomach kinda rough ‘cause that c-section left scars
Don’t let that ever take away from how special you are
There’s no other, you a wife, daughter, sister or mother
You might show a little body or you keep it all covered
To later be discovered by that real man of your dreams
Who’s appreciating the honor to stand with a queen

It don’t matter what other people think of you
It don’t matter the situations you’ve been through
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna give you love, it’s not my place to judge
It don’t matter, what you got or what you have
It don’t matter, the things you did in your past
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna show you some love, it’s not my place to judge

Outspoken or quiet, tall, curvy or slim
Six pack, a little belly fat, top heavy or trim
Personality outgoing or you shy and composed
Plain Jane wardrobe, a lot of colorful clothes
Straight, long or wide nose, matters the actual case
Whether you love to wear makeup or your natural face
Got a degree or GED or you just dropped out early
Played sports and got dirty or just straight up girlie
We ain’t worthy and it’s extra if she cold in that kitchen
Some grind behind the scenes, others love the attention
Birthmarks, freckles or moles or dimples in both cheeks
Characteristics from the creator that make you unique
Don’t be ashamed just because you’re not pictured the same
As another or you don’t have a particular frame
You’ve been to jail and never did time and life and of course
Domestically abused, single, separated, divorced

It don’t matter what other people think of you
It don’t matter the situations you’ve been through
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna give you love, it’s not my place to judge
It don’t matter, what you got or what you have
It don’t matter, the things you did in your past
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna show you some love, it’s not my place to judge

Got violated by a stranger and can’t even discuss it
A lot of sistas been molested by a man that they trusted
No babies, a bunch of babies, life was hopeless and hard
Drug abuse, custody wars, deep emotional scars
Mistakes made, second and third chances at love
Might have had it easy in life, might have danced at the club
It don’t matter ‘cause your presence is the greatest to me
See you can still become the queen you was created to be
A lot of people pass judgement, too unable to see
That the creator views you in the most sacred degree
They beat you up verbally and left your thoughts affected
Disrespected you because your skin was dark complected, or light
But understand you’re an exceptional woman
Overcame a health challenge or still suffering from it
When you ‘bout to fall, she got to be the person you call
Every variation of you gave birth to us all

It don’t matter what other people think of you
It don’t matter the situations you’ve been through
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna give you love, it’s not my place to judge
It don’t matter, what you got or what you have
It don’t matter, the things you did in your past
It don’t matter, I just wanna be with you up
Just wanna show you some love, it’s not my place to judge",https://genius.com/K-rino-it-dont-matter-lyrics
Drive, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"They ask how I keep growing, and why I'm still flowing
And what is my motivation and why I keep going
And when will I start slipping, how many years longer
And how after 30 plus, I seem to get stronger
Talent is God given, but laziness can trickle it
The skill I was born with, the desire to triple it
Meticulous craft work, never passing up one step
The sick ability to keep manufacturing concepts
Pushing the envelope, chancing and being risky
Striving to write what's never been written in history
Unseen extreme hard hours of practice
Touching the masses of all age demographics
Making my place when it's said and done, undebateable
Conquering every continent, staying relatable
Mind full of bullets, I'm shooting em' all off
First rapper to never slip or never fall off

That's drive, drive, drive
Drive drive drive drive
For as long as I'm alive live
Live, live, live, live
I'll never lose my

When I sit down and write, I'm focused and I'm determined
As long as you keep learning the flames keep burning
Can't expect to be elite if my product is weak
Sometimes I dream of sick lines and wake up out of my sleep
I want to stay in bed, but I got bars to submit
I stagger to my book and write em' down before I forget
Gotta dig deeper and deeper when I'm designing
'Cause there's another writer somewhere putting the time in
Infinitely climbing, not minding to suffer
So if he's up to 5am writing I'm up ‘til 6
I gotta make sure my raps are the best
Fell asleep with my folder, beat playing, collapsed on my desk
If I think it, I say it, to the wind I throw caution
Forcing my thoughts to extreme points of exhaustion
Deep from inside, what's keeping the flame alive
Is taking pride in mine and never losing my drive

That's drive, drive, drive
Drive drive drive drive
For as long as I'm alive live
Live, live, live, live
I'll never lose my

I got a voice in my head that keeps me on balance
And it's been with me ever since I took on the challenge
From day one it said, If you're serious I'll show ya
The difference between being great and mediocre
And greatness ain't easy, it's hard being creative
Do you wanna imitate or be lyrically innovative?
Being passionate about it and clever is a win win
And the goal is to dominate, never to blend in
Will you quit ‘cause people don't wanna hear no realism?
When they say they don't like you, can you handle the criticism?
Do you lack the ferocity to masticate every track up
When you do become great will you get complacent and slack up
I said that I'm determined and I'll always remain to be
I'll never cheat the game by disrespecting it's sanctity
While others violate it shamelessly
I'll do my best to never disappoint the people if I'm the artist they came to see

That's drive, drive, drive
Drive drive drive drive
For as long as I'm alive live
Live, live, live, live
I'll never lose my",https://genius.com/K-rino-drive-lyrics
Can’t Get It Off,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"Man, I hate when I feel like this
Rising above emotion to the thinking of God, yo

I got a cloud floating over me
Lately I’ve been noticing my total vibe and energy ain’t where it’s supposed to be
Always in a dry mood
Can’t seem to recapture my stride, dude, no matter how many times I try to
I once felt similar
I don’t wanna do nothin’ but shoot ball, come home and listen to the Minister
The skies look sinister
It’s like I’m inside of a storm with the calm sitting outside the perimeter
Anxieties I can’t release ‘em
My dreams dangling a foot in front of me but somehow I can’t reach ‘em
I’m gettin’ kinda frustrated
Don’t you hate it when you gotta come up off some money when you just made it
Like damn, what do this mean?
It’s like things gettin’ more messed up the more brother try to fix things
I’m just tryna warn you
I’m at a point where not being happy feels normal

I can’t get it off
It’s like a hundred pound weight strapped to me
Can’t run and can’t walk
I can’t get it off
Straight jackin’, feet shackled with some duct tape covering my mouth
I’m just tryna be a grown man, grown man
I’m just tryna be a grown man, a grown man, yeah

Now my spirit ain’t broken, just not a lot of words spoken
I’m walkin’ ‘round goin’ through the motions
Nighttime approachin’
I’m overdosing on peace as it soaks in, silence is my close friend
I’m blocking out the deep hurt
Wish I could put my life in reverse ‘cause I’m wearing regret like a t-shirt
Wish I had a precursor to see first
But even with these quirks, I’m knowin’ that my issue could be worse
Anger level rising, I’m tryna get over the hump
But I’m coming up short as a fire hydrant
I’m listening to wise men
But if you don't apply what they’re advising, results shouldn’t be surprising
I’m seeing things plainly
I wish I could point the finger at somebody else but I gotta blame me
And shaking off this mess now
A waste of time like tryna wipe a tattoo off with a wet towel

I can’t get it off
It’s like a hundred pound weight strapped to me
Can’t run and can’t walk
I can’t get it off
Straight jackin’, feet shackled with some duct tape covering my mouth
I’m just tryna be a grown man, grown man
I’m just tryna be a grown man, a grown man, yeah

I just wanna stay in bed
Bad intentions in my head, and I ain’t even takin’ no meds
It took a minute to add it
I had to fall into some madness just to appreciate how good I had it
Folks smiling and laughing, bro
You see ‘em at the job and at the store but how many of ‘em are really happy though
False status and matrimony
I keep going even when I’m lonely
‘cause I got people depending on me
Another thing that ails me —
If I wasn’t myself and came to me for some advice, what would I tell me?
I been tryna convince ya
The same people that oughta be in your corner are the ones rootin’ against ya
It’s comin’ off kinda hateful
But do I really wanna share what I built up with somebody who ain’t grateful?
Lettin’ dead weight stop me
I gotta be the one to look out for myself if ain’t nobody else got me

I can’t get it off
It’s like a hundred pound weight strapped to me
Can’t run and can’t walk
I can’t get it off
Straight jackin’, feet shackled with some duct tape covering my mouth
I’m just tryna be a grown man, grown man
I’m just tryna be a grown man, a grown man, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-cant-get-it-off-lyrics
Stars Without Stages,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Teach you something real valuable today, man

See they never been on TV or radio either
All they ever did was take care of you, love you and feed ya
Teach ya how to make it through this life and what life means
Punch the clock and keep the bills paid, same routine
You ain't never seen a star if you haven't seen mothers
They don't get to be on movie screens or magazine covers
They just go about their day working their regular grind
No award ceremonies and they never get shine
We chase celebrities and power 'cause it's clout that we seek
But can your favorite rapper stretch ten dollars out through a week?
Gotta judge her off her hardwork instead of her looks
And when you went to jail who was putting bread on your books?
She don't have a million Twitter followers and no hits
Only you and your sister or your brother, that's it
You supposed to take the pressure off of them and let 'em be free
To quote KD, mama's the real MVP

The real star is your parents, not a singer or rapper
Not a sports athlete, politician or actor
It ain't 'bout having lit social media pages
'cause real superstars don't perform on stages
The real star is your parents, not a singer or rapper
Not a sports athlete, politician or actor
It ain't 'bout having lit social media pages
'cause real superstars don't perform on stages

Picture waking every morning ten or twenty years straight
Showing up consistently to work a job that you hate
Week after week cost of living don't come cheap
Providing for a whole family, sometimes one deep
Paparazzi don't chase them, no pictures get took
Ain't no award show for mama for the meals that she cooks
Catching buses just to get around, no new cars
No interviews on big talk shows for working two jobs
Don't complain about your parents, youngsta, leave them be
When daddy leave the house, we ain't seeing TMZ
He developed your growth, watched and looked over you closely
Bought that car when you graduated, where's his trophy?
Even when you grown we still rely on their help
He gave some classic whoopings, they need to retire his belt
And hang it from the ceiling in your house, a sign of respect
Because that's one of many things they use to keep us in check

The real star is your parents, not a singer or rapper
Not a sports athlete, politician or actor
It ain't 'bout having lit social media pages
'cause real superstars don't perform on stages
The real star is your parents, not a singer or rapper
Not a sports athlete, politician or actor
It ain't 'bout having lit social media pages
'cause real superstars don't perform on stages

Forget fights, footage and , we don't need that title
Record somebody paying a light bill, make that go viral
Once you realize the things they do, it's hard to believe it
Grandparents need awards for lifetime achievements
We should live for mom and dad for all the hell we give 'em
Next time you see a struggling parent, take a selfie with 'em
Who been supporting you and staying down with ya?
These the ones you need to run to and ask for a picture
She don't need a lot of applause coming at her because
She's a star in reality, you like reality stars
But what's crazy they the source of whatever you do
Every attribute that you got they gave it to you
They ain't walking no red carpet, ain't no big tour bus
Not performing in front of twenty thousand people, just us
You love to be around celebrities, gazing and staring
You want a real autograph, go get one from your parents

The real star is your parents, not a singer or rapper
Not a sports athlete, politician or actor
It ain't 'bout having lit social media pages
'cause real superstars don't perform on stages
The real star is your parents, not a singer or rapper
Not a sports athlete, politician or actor

Sick For No Reason,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"*COUGHING*
I don't know what's wrong with me man
I don't know doc I... *COUGHING*
I been feeling like this all my life

They know I keep fire breathing till the people start leaving
Got your congregation beating I get mad and even
Cause I'm sick for no reason, sick for no reason
Sick for no reason, sick for no reason

I don't drink Moscato or play the lotto
I be the 'Desperado' on a quest to mob and murder El Diablo
I hope and wish you overdose on stupid and approach this
I'll squish you till you look like floating residue in a soap dish
While you still breathe they'll grieve you
My hand gripped to be weak and feeble and from it the jaws of life couldn't free you
You see you better learn the ropes fast before I hide you like a dope-stash
And they find you in remote grass with ya throat slashed
Retarded school is where they'll put dude
I stuck my shoes through twenty fools last Tuesday and I was in a good mood
Smack ya just for tryna look rude
Then I grind you up into an unrecognisable pile of human ______
A million quotes spawned from one singular proton
Spacecraft speed in a slow run, pistol whip you with no gun
I hate 'em all, how could they possibly love me
They wanna probably shove me in a CD-ROM and dub three copies of me


Forgive me if I hadn't played the set but some guy had made a bet
That I couldn't take one steel plate and create a jet
I'm fast as a wild rabbit, the elaborate style magnet
With the 79 mile-high mental file cabinet
Soon as your solo drop, I'm a switch ya head out with a komodo's top
Literally real life version of Photoshop
Shake ya till you bust like a soda pop
The bowls I throw knock buildings over like King Kong doing a Robocop
I terrorize you through the year, remove your ear as a souvenir
Dudes listen to my music wearing scuba gear
The greatest books from top to bottom I read
Sometimes I even wear my skull on the outside of my head
How many portals can you fly through?
My IQ pass right by you I ride on sky-high Frisbees that I threw (woo)
See you don't wanna see the rap reaper with grim features
Reach for your bottom teeth and pull 'em out like gym bleachers


If you live too far to see me live
You can catch my 3D homicides next Friday check the Martian TV guide
Too crazy to be denied my pen is morbid
Rapper's DNA deposits found on every garment in my linen closet
Turn the heat up, let's see how high his fever run
I'm yet to meet a dude like me, hell I ain't even one
My physics is throwed, my flows in his soul
Is like putting a killer whale into a goldfish bowl
Now we must fight, your lyrical pistol don't even bust right
Mine can shoot from 900 miles and strike a dust mite
Attack cartilage when sparks hit from the cartridge
My bottom jaw is a sharp ridge, one ton Draw Bridge
We the lifelong grudge men who love wins
My verse recorded cleanly with the mic not even plugged in
I gain facts and attack you with snaps that make the brain crack
Pull insane acts like strapping wack rapfold into train tracks",https://genius.com/K-rino-sick-for-no-reason-lyrics
Never Born,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"""I hate this world. Sometimes I wish that I was never born.""

Imagine if my existence hadn't been endeavored yet
Imagine if my parents were strangers and never met
Or even if they did, from that path they could've strayed
And decided to go somewhere else the day that I was made
Or maybe they still played it out completely but instead, another semen head that I was racing beat me to the egg
And not being the first one to notice or be the worst one and Mama ended up birthing a totally different person with a weaker mind
Think of how hard it would be to last
Suppose that he was still a rap artist, but he was trash
Nothing that I did would ever be done, righteous or bad and no one would care because you can't miss what you never had
Sad when I hit my lowest and all sympathy died, and success was like a cab that wouldn't give me a ride
How altered would the route be if no one knew about me?
And would my family and friends be better off without me?

If I was never born how different would it be?
Would people feel the loss of somebody they'd never see?
And directly be affected good or negatively?
Or another dude was walking this road rather than me
If I was never born would things be the same way?
Or would my absence cause others to go astray?
The exclusion of K from life's continual numbers
Since I'm here, since I'll never find out, I just wonder

My non-existence in the world might triple the threat, and might misdirect the whole universe's ripple effect
The world's portrait, minus me, would be differently painted
People I've introduced might have never been acquainted
There's no way to explain it, or acknowledge it or fill it
The people that I talked out of doing wrong might've did it
The lives I effected would possibly be destroyed
Or maybe God would send somebody else to fill the void
But on the flip side, what about the bad deeds?
The evil seeds I planted that grew at fast speeds
The things that I was doin' that left some lives ruined, might not have happened if they hadn't fell under my influence
Was me being here worth it?
I defeated my purpose
The worse part is knowing that I can never reverse it
Now my self signification got me facin' frustration
The contemplation that I might be a wasted creation

If I was never born how different would it be?
Would people feel the loss of somebody they'd never see?
And directly be affected good or negatively?
Or another dude was walking this road rather than me
If I was never born would things be the same way?
Or would my absence cause others to go astray?
The exclusion of K from life's continual numbers
Since I'm here, since I'll never find out, I just wonder

Cause even if you feel like you was born out of season, don't sit around believin' that you're here for no reason
If the planets know around the Sun, they have to rotate
You should know you have a purpose, it's just yours to locate
Find yourself, cultivate your talents, God will support it
The womb is not the only place that life can be aborted
Your dream died in your head the second that you thought it, cause you didn't have the fate to act on it and get it started
So depressed and suicidal, feeling hopeless and left out
Life ain't a supermarket stop trying to check yourself out
There's a lesson in each struggle if you look deep and explore it
A wise person uses setbacks to move forward
If you was never born, that would be a disaster
No love, no accomplishments and no laughter
And did you ever wonder, maybe your present pain could've been blocked by a friend of love, one who never came

If I was never born how different would it be?
Would people feel the loss of somebody they'd never see?
And directly be affected good or negatively?
Or another dude was walking this road rather than me
If I was never born would things be the same way?
Or would my absence cause others to go astray?
The exclusion of K from life's continual numbers
Since I'm here, since I'll never find out, I just wonder",https://genius.com/K-rino-never-born-lyrics
The Struggle Made Me Great,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Yeah, you know it's like everything that you went through served a purpose to make you into what you are
If you understand you embrace it
Greatness is there for everybody, if you're willing to chase it
Let's go

I climbed a lot of mountains, I walked a lot of roads
I had a open window, that open window closed
I used to dream of blowing up, touring, rocking shows
The more you starve for accolades, the more the hunger grows
I fell in love with writing raps, so I took my chance
Had people trying to kill my dream, they said it wouldn't last
And some were just concerned about me, told me go to school
Said just in case this don't work out, find something else to do
But I was never down with that, I practiced every day
I chose to go all out and let the chips fall where they may
I kept doing my thing and wash the doubtful seeds away
'Cause making a Plan B would mean I didn't believe in A

The struggle made me great, the struggle made me great
I hurdled every obstacle and covered every base
I went from being broke to getting love in every state
Depended on my strength and faith when others couldn't wait
The struggle made me great, the struggle made me great
I hurdled every obstacle and covered every base
I went from being broke to getting love in every state
Depended on my strength and faith when others couldn't wait

I went the Chitlin' Circuit, I pushed and built my buzz
I was too young and underage, still getting in clubs
Going to war in other hoods, tryna get a name
But when I look back on it now I had to be insane
'Cause my city was wild and I was living in the midst
But God protects the humble soul and ignorance is bliss
And plus I had my eyes on something I'd wanted for years
Can't win unless your motivation's greater than your fears
You gotta take this serious, it's not something you play with
Plus if you want the prize then the pain becomes the payment
Hateful words stated and some came out my own mouth
Got tired of doors slamming on me, so I built my own house
The fighting and the grind is priceless in my mind
I appreciate it now, but didn't like it at the time
Scared to chase the finish line when it's right there for you to see
But if you're wise you let the BS push you where you need to be
Confidence was big until you let the doubters shrink it
You heard you couldn't win so many times you start to think it
That's when you start to feel like negativity's the norm
Don't be alarmed 'cause motivation comes in many forms

The struggle made me great, the struggle made me great
I hurdled every obstacle and covered every base
I went from being broke to getting love in every state
Depended on my strength and faith when others couldn't wait
The struggle made me great, the struggle made me great
I hurdled every obstacle and covered every base
I went from being broke to getting love in every state
Depended on my strength and faith when others couldn't wait

Trying to break our behavior, with statements that I gave ya
And hopes that I can take your mind from Satan to the savior
You gonna lose a lot of homies, right now you stressed and lonely
The more painful the road, the stronger the testimony
See I only eat the realness and regurgitate the phony
To everyone who ever spent a dollar with your homie
Just know that I got love for each supporter that cares
Asking me for autographs when I should be asking for theirs
See even slow progression is a lesson not to quit
And rejection can become the biggest blessing that you get
And the message that work ethic is a preface is legit
So is success predestined is the question I submit
See don't minimize your purpose, 'cos your dreams are yet to flourish
And it's real easy for me to tell you not to get discouraged
My words are just a help, not to put you below myself
Because I struggle with the same problems as everybody else

The struggle made me great, the struggle made me great
I hurdled every obstacle and covered every base
I went from being broke to getting love in every state
Depended on my strength and faith when others couldn't wait
The struggle made me great, the struggle made me great
I hurdled every obstacle and covered every base
I went from being broke to getting love in every state
Depended on my strength and faith when others couldn't wait",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-struggle-made-me-great-lyrics
My Bike,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"Another tragic story

I rode my bike to the store ‘cause I like to explore
Had some coupons in my pocket so the price would be lower
Yesterday was cool, today is twice as nice as before
I pedaled through a bunch of cars and pulled up right to the door
After I rolled through the lot, about to go in the spot
I heard somebody call my name out (“K-Rino!”) so I stopped
It was a fellow from the hood back in the day I had known
“What’s goin’ on?”
“I’m ‘bout to grab some food to cook later on”
My bike had entered his optics, I was just finna lock it
He said, “No need to chain it up, I’ll be outside, I can watch it”
I was like, “I don’t know, I came a mighty long way”
Was hesitant and apprehensive but I still said ok
Now as I waited in line, panic played in my mind
I’m tryna hurry but the cashier was takin’ the time
Why is this taking so long? I finally paid and got on
But sure enough, when I came out, my bicycle was gone

I’m feeling like the sky is falling
The sky is falling
Yeah, it’s falling
They stole my bike so now I’m walking
Now I’m walking
Yeah, I’m walking
My homies laughing when I’m calling
I feel like squabbin’
It’s so appalling
I’m posting pictures of it often
Looking and stalking
I’m goin’ all in
Yeah

I guess he had it all planned, I ran as fast as I can
Standing, looking stupid with this grocery bag in my hand
I hate this world that we live, it’s all take and no give
Plus on top of that, I still had to walk to the crib
My bike was wonderfully stacks, that’s right, in front of me, Jack
Why’d I trust this bummy cat, I’m such a dummy for that
Where’s all the thoughts and the prayers, it’s like nobody cares
I’m searching everybody, pushing little kids off of theirs
Man, I done flipped my persona, bro, I’m trippin’ so I’ma
Run back in the house before this little boy go get his mama
Label me as confused, I ain’t seein’ no clues
I’m ready to call a press conference, this should be on the news
Some say it’s only a bike, how come you feelin’ so sad?
I told ‘em, “Y’all don’t understand all of the moments we had”
And I’m not gettin’ no closer, now police comin’ over
Reward posters said ‘Last seen in front of Kroger’

I’m feeling like the sky is falling
The sky is falling
Yeah, it’s falling
They stole my bike so now I’m walking
Now I’m walking
Yeah, I’m walking
My homies laughing when I’m calling
I feel like squabbin’
It’s so appalling
I’m posting pictures of it often
Looking and stalking
I’m goin’ all in

I miss each part of it most, this shattered all of my hopes
It had reflectors all around and tennis balls in the spokes
This guy done took what I had, I wanna whoop him so bad
They gon’ have to surgically remove my foot from his
Ask
 me if I care what you think, my sanity’s on the brink
I’m psychologically affected now, I might need a shrink
From sunlight ’til it’s dark, I’m searching backwards and forth
I checked every pawn shop from South Park to the north
It ain’t no sleepin’ or nappin’ I can’t eat like I’m fastin’
I told the officer what happened and he couldn’t stop laughing
Guess I’m now on my own ‘cause it’s officially gone
My only memory is a screensaver picture on my phone
Now who could do such a thing? They had to be outta hell
Some say go buy another one, Academy got a sale
Man, I’m fixin’ to lose it, can’t even listen to music
Now I’m lookin’ at this stupid chain, wishin’ I used it

I’m feeling like the sky is falling
The sky is falling
Yeah, it’s falling
They stole my bike so now I’m walking
Now I’m walking
Yeah, I’m walking
My homies laughing when I’m calling
I feel like squabbin’
It’s so appalling
I’m posting pictures of it often
Looking and stalking
I’m goin’ all in

Finish Moves,Alien Baby,2011.0,"This is lyrical MMA
Microphone Murder Association
To my homie Big Sniper, to my homie Point Plank
To my partner Gangsta NIP, to my homie Rapper K
What's up to Murder One, that boy 50 in the building
My partner DBX, Eye Q, Tech
The whole SPC

You see I'm known to make my enemies pack up
When I start to act up, your back-up's back up will need back up
I pppow these bars out
Kick you through a 3 foot wide goal post from 270, 000 yards out
I'm tryna leave your head flat when I rap
Like anatomies after an accidental bungee cord snap
You didn't see me last year? Oh well
I spent 2010 vacationing in 2012
See on a scale of one to ten for me a 9 comes through
Add your skill with mine, that would give us a 9.2
Baby styles don't rattle me
Beating me in battles is impossible like going to Sunday school on Saturday
Thread by thread I'm unravelling men
I'm writing verses with a 9 foot javelin pen
I bought a bottle of Patron, I'll admit it
But I didn't get it to drink, I bought it to shatter your dome with it

The 5 o'clock news is where I'm sending fools
How can you survive when I apply my verbal finish moves?
Wipe out his mind before he ever saw my image
You can't stop me when I'm done 'cause when I'm done you'll be finished

Might want to show up early, you don't want to miss the damage
My advantage is dissing, so I guess I'm at a disadvantage
See, I'll choke you out with a single hand
And then rip the top part of your head off like a Pringles can
There's certain words you should never release
Like a dude asking a dude if he wear boxers or briefs
I brought a missile to my last fight
And a military nerve gas, so what you doing here with a stick and a flashlight?
See, every soldier in my troop is cold
I'll show you what the future holds when I get back from the 2015 Super Bowl
I blew the planet up 3 times last month from rapping
I clicked ""undo"", that's why y'all never knew it happened
How can you think clear and hear things
If I make you wear a pair of 80 pound barbell earrings?
See, what I said blew up om his head, straight break him and split his bread
I got the green light even when it's red

The 5 o'clock news is where I'm sending fools
How can you survive when I apply my verbal finish moves?
Wipe out his mind before he ever saw my image
You can't stop me when I'm done 'cause when I'm done you'll be finished

What I exert made every minute hurt
You went from putting in the work to putting on a skinny shirt and a tennis skirt
See, H-Town, that's the city that I'm repping
You got a weapon in your trunk? I got a trunk on my weapon
Where the casualties are kept after failing the first try out
Use my mic like a machete and slice a piece of the sky out
You like to play, I got something that make you stop grinning
I keep never losing and you keep on not winning
See, when it's on I'm not the dude you want to rub wrong
I'm so rough I murder rappers with my love songs
South Park is the essence of a thug zone
After my shows there's nothing left, the whole club's gone!
Your skills are so little, microscopes couldn't spot them
You ain't even at the top part of the bottom
Respect me is what an inferior's supposed to do
I break spirits like I was snapping a ghost in two

The 5 o'clock news is where I'm sending fools
How can you survive when I apply my verbal finish moves?
Wipe out his mind before he ever saw my image
You can't stop me when I'm done 'cause when I'm done you'll be finished
The 5 o'clock news is where I'm sending fools
How can you survive when I apply my verbal finish moves?

Murder in the Booth,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"Start a confusion with bars that I’m using, my thought is proven
Art of illusion, jump in a pool without the water moving
Die if you try to maneuver, violent diatribe shooter
The loser gotta smoke a cyanide hookah
You knew that my vocal fluid was super
My older music is newer than any music that you can do in the future
They wanna view as I’m schooling this doofus
But see the truth of the matter is their fools are comparing Lucifer to 
The subjects are rushing in with no supplements
By the time you finish buffering, my conscious already published another ten
Suffocate the wind of these puppet men
Coupled with uppercuts, two to the face like a double chin
I love it when I visit the future and then some of the past
I can see my reflection when I’m not in front of a glass
The human power tool, my senses have now improved
I can sit in a loud room and hear the clouds over 

It’s murder in the booth, it’s murder in the booth
I’m the killer that’s on the loose, killer that’s on the loose
Loadin’ up on top of the roof, loadin’ up on the roof
‘bout to put my weapon to use, ‘bout to put that thing to use
It’s murder in the booth, it’s murder in the booth
I’m the killer that’s on the loose, killer that’s on the loose
Loadin’ up on top of the roof, loadin’ up on the roof
‘bout to put my weapon to use, ‘bout to put that thing to use

I’m not on a regular rap grid, I can snap and decap wigs
And mentally interact with arachnids
Pushed him from behind and he backslid
My focus so exact, I wrote this on a roller coaster undistracted
I’m rare and I bleed ya and keep meat slabs in the freezer
Could barely complete this song ‘cause my pen was having a seizure
I lead you to quick slaughter though I could spit harder
The kickstarter, every time I read the books get smarter
I calculate that nobody would pay for what you have to say
You couldn’t be a ghost writer if you passed away
I respond with metaphorical rainstorms
Plus I knew what you was thinkin’ before your brain formed
I’m trackin’ and smashin’ up your paragraphical structure
Mix happiness with your pain so you laugh as you suffer
I’m the friendliest stranger entangled in envy and anger
My head is a chamber that came with a twenty disc changer

It’s murder in the booth, it’s murder in the booth
I’m the killer that’s on the loose, killer that’s on the loose
Loadin’ up on top of the roof, loadin’ up on the roof
‘bout to put my weapon to use, ‘bout to put that thing to use
It’s murder in the booth, it’s murder in the booth
I’m the killer that’s on the loose, killer that’s on the loose
Loadin’ up on top of the roof, loadin’ up on the roof
‘bout to put my weapon to use, ‘bout to put that thing to use

Control the game while laying in bed
So much light coming from my mind, I wear a lamp shade on my head
In the secretest skill, I’m never tellin’ that
Nobody knows where I’m dwellin’ at because I hid my house under my welcome mat
Don’t need a gun, just let the beat run
I count from a thousand backwards scrambling numbers and won’t repeat one
Beat you for months just because you seek a response
Hear fifty people clearly even if they’re speaking at once
No hiding, even no lying, I’m beating you coldly
I go to your site and post people eating emojis
If a volcano reached its heat summit, I wouldn’t feel one degree if I was ‘sleep eleven feet from it
People with weak stomachs might vomit if they try and step
They threw me in the lions den and the lions left
Human explosive, watch the shrapnel that flew up
Strap myself to you but it only blows you up

It’s murder in the booth, it’s murder in the booth
I’m the killer that’s on the loose, killer that’s on the loose
Loadin’ up on top of the roof, loadin’ up on the roof
‘bout to put my weapon to use, ‘bout to put that thing to use
It’s murder in the booth, it’s murder in the booth
I’m the killer that’s on the loose, killer that’s on the loose
Loadin’ up on top of the roof, loadin’ up on the roof

Fightin’ the Force,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"I wrestle with a force in the nighttime
I felt like I was slipping out my right mind
An image that I couldn’t seem to wipe out
He’s waiting every time I turn the lights out
Constantly attacking while I’m sleeping and he won’t rest
I’m paralyzed, trapped inside my own flesh
Tryna think of something I can do to make him slow down
I’m screaming but my mouth is making no sound
Maybe if I calm down, I can try to break free
I know it’s over if I let him take me
Suspended animation and I couldn’t even stand up
My wrists stuck together like I’m handcuffed
Begging for the morning, it’s the only time that I’m free
His presence automatically would blind me
Panicking and nervous, got me shaking and it’s no lie
And the crazy part is I don’t even know why

I’m afraid to go to sleep with forces hanging over me
I’m swinging ‘bows and wrestling while in my mind I’m questioning why
Who is this guy?
Coming every night?
Making me fight?

If I don’t make it out of this, I will sink
I couldn’t say a word but I could still blink
Had to find a reason to get out of his control soon
A dark shadow covered up the whole room
Then it flew down from the ceiling and the bed dropped
It put me in a full nelson headlock
Tried to fight it back but I didn’t last too long
I couldn’t get away ‘cause it was too strong
Then he lifted me and threw me up against a stone wall
I’m wishin’ I could yell or make a phone call
Tryna think it out and tryin’ not to make a wrong move
That’s when I heard a deep voice say, “I own you”
Couldn’t deal with the punishment I was absorbing, the external and internal torment
Wonder if I’ll ever make it back to a calm state
‘cause it’s been happenin’ every night for ‘bout a month straight

I’m afraid to go to sleep with forces hanging over me
I’m swinging ‘bows and wrestling while in my mind I’m questioning why
Who is this guy?
Coming every night?
Making me fight?

The next night, I was tryna clear my mind out
I came up with an idea to find out what was terrorizing me and causing all these head wounds
I put a video recorder in my bedroom
Felt myself gettin’ sleepy so I took my clothes off
Then I hit record right before I dozed off
Fought through the night again ’til I felt the sunrise
But this time I’ma see him with my own eyes
I was real anxious when I woke up the next day
I picked up the recorder and I pressed play
Couldn’t wait to see the entity when it rose up
I watched about an hour then it showed up
Now I get to finally see who could this brother be
He picked the pillow up and tried to smother me
Fought my way out and took a breath for recovery
He looked in the camera, that’s when I saw it was another me
All of these nights I been fighting in this hell-house
It was me against me tryna take myself out
Why was this evil clone here? What’s he gonna do?
Then a voice in my head said, “The evil one is you
I’m the righteous side of you, you chose to go a lower route
So I come every night to fight your wickedness and choke it out
If you want me to unlock the greatness, I’d be glad to
I just need you to submit and let me kill the bad you”

I’m afraid to go to sleep with forces hanging over me
I’m swinging ‘bows and wrestling while in my mind I’m questioning why

Only One Me,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"Y'all need a break you dummies ain't seeing straight
The only thing that I'm not great at is not being great
Listen, being real can cost you a lot but it's free to hate
Feel like I live in a bakery now 'cause all I see is cake
You wanna work? Hit me up you can afford me I'm cheap
I'm magical, a 5 minute tape can record me for weeks
Plus I'm similar to the ocean, they explored me I'm deep
The most interesting man in the world bored me to sleep
Quick on the draw, when I'm pulling up out my mic I'm not a slow aimer
Blast the meat from your cranial frame, now it's a no brainer
I love to spit, you on some other shit that'll get yo cousin hit I'm hot to pick my CD you need an oven mitt
Don't mention K-Rino please stay in your own lane
Steve Harvey Rappers y'all be callin' out the wrong name
You got a crown I'ma snatch it like a rebound
I'm so cold that I even miss myself when I leave town

It's whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
A whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
It's a whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
A whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me

It's only one of me, yup it's only one of me
Line em' up and I'ma wipe out any chump in front of me
It's only one of me, yup it's only one of me
Line em up and I'ma wipe out any chump in front of me

I guess that you could write in your other life
But you messing with me is just like trying to cut a tree down with butter knife
Listenin' to K-Rino is like you being fed drugs
Uh huh, yeah it does, these boys bitin' like bed bugs
I get the mic and start dumping they'll never see me coming
I'm so rough, I made nothing from nothing leave me somethin'
All it takes is some straightening to get these fellas right
Come to your show and run through you like a yellow light
Once I escape it'll take a second for you to break
You such a fraud that even Bigfoot said you was fake
These dudes bowing and they scared to stand up I swing so abrupt that I made a headless man duck
There's nobody you can think up like K-Rino so don't compare me
I wear a mic on my hip in public like open carry
Hypnotic robotic melodic fully loaded warrior
You couldn't write the way that I write if I wrote it for ya

It's whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
A whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
It's a whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
A whole Lotta y'all but it's only one me
Now tell em'
It's only one of me, yup it's only one of me
Line em' up and I'ma wipe out any chump in front of me
It's only one of me, yup it's only one of me
Line em up and I'ma wipe out any chump in front of me

See what I'm sayin' right now is right now to me
But won't be right now to you until you hear me sayin' it on the CD
Which is right now, but not the same as when I first spit it
'cause my now is then and your now is right now, you get it?
I might run up in the place and start breaking his face
The only thing that you perfect at is making mistakes
I was blasting the Savage Pros in my amateur days
I got pictures of me I took before cameras were made
Sling blade, got a rap complain against you I can't wait to file it
I'm smiling like a dude that just found Bill Gates' wallet
Your lines are old I'm tellin' you they won't work for long
You need to put them ancient verses in a nursing home
So now you whine about what happened to you
No excuses like when a rude person step on your shoe
I stay bringing it, a choir of rhyming angels I'm singing with

The Wrong Thang,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"Yeah, laws took my homeboy Q to jail mayn
Racist bastards for real, never believe them fools
Playing with em mayn, no love for the police
The Mayor the Governor, the President
None of em, racist bastards

We ain't no motherfucking slaves or no damn cotton pickers
God made man but the devil made niggas
I'm fed up with apologizing and sympathizing
If you ready soldier up partner let's start a uprising
You trying to love your enemy then fuck the words you speak
Who the hell you think taught your ass to turn the other cheek
Ain't no trust, load cock aim at they sweater and bust
These racist bastards treat they damn dogs better than us
The police ain't shit they shoot and man handle ya
Every few years a black man gets beat down on camera
Then we act shocked and surprised start bitching and protest
But it's a thousand ass whoopings a day that they don't catch
They said Satan would deceive men, he ain't no atheist
His own self is the God that his racist ass believes in
I saw a sell out and I spilled him
I killed him when I caught him masturbating to a picture of Paris Hilton

Scared to make change, focused on the wrong thang
Keep playing this game, and motherfuckers gon hang
Tied up in chains, don't even know your own name
Line up your aim, and take him out from long range

They lock you up and then they let you
Out with a felony so you can't a job now you at home and your woman don't respect you
The pressure kicks in, you get back on the block
And get popped caught up in a cycle, now you right back on lock
That's the plan, to make you stop acting right
A man works off rational thought and reason, a beast is controlled by appetite
Now you a animal, you smell flesh and swarm it
See somebody else with some shit that you want, you strong arm it
Black people scared to speak out
If they gave us reparations, we'll give that shit back to the white man before the week out
Yeah I see you with your tight grill
Twenty thousand dollars worth of diamonds in your mouth and can't pay your light bill
We some backwards ass folks
Hard-headed stupid ass people, satisfied with struggling and being broke
It ain't no other way to figure it
How you gon expect a child to learn a damn thang if his own parents is ignorant


Iraq done had a million soldiers there
Years done passed they said it's all done, if so why the fuck they still over there
If you young and black they'll have you
Fuck the armed forces, don't sign up for that shit and don't let em draft you
The death and injury is certain
Soldiers risking they life for crumbs while others are getting rich working for Haliburton
The news ain't giving up the whole game
Boys is getting maimed, flamed with artillery disfigured and coming up lain
United States home of the snitches and snakes
Fuck the so-called holidays all them bitches is fake
Thanksgiving, Easter, it's all some bullshit to me
And God condemns the Christmas tree at Jeremiah 10, 3
So read your book fool and don't swallow these lies
You wanna see into a man's soul just follow his eyes
And scary uncle tom hoes, I leave this on ya

Permanently stay determined to burn em' with every sermon
See my words be up where the birds be verbally free
And undeterred to speak on whatever concepts that serve me
They wanna brain-cuff a king and bring pain and suffering
Any time a angel starts to fly they try to cut it's wings
Look at all these slaves with they fractured arms up and slings
After being vigorously snatched up by the puppet strings
They can't tempt me I'm a turn down whatever they show me
K's the man rebellious slaves that'll never say Toby
Youse a hooker and ya pimp left ya powerless
Telling you how and what to write and how to dress
No more enslavement cause I'm beyond emancipation
Shaped in God's form, by him no other's hands creation
We crack Adams or Leeches who try to track your talents
We leave the children behind and kidnap the parents
The vultures who holding the prophets is outta control
Violence explodes instantly when you try to get bold
Got a big hole that resides in your soul
Forget diamonds and gold you better off sliding down the pole
In a glance you went from twenty-thousand ball parked fans in the stance
To greeting costumers wearing Wal-Mart pants

Never selling they soul or bowing down to catch a couple grand
Last time that I checked I was a man but unlike some of y'all
Never ran from someone who breathe the same, knowing they too can fall
These niggas out here prostituting for radio play
Gay is what that is to let them vanish your freedom away
Freedom of speech, look at what happened with me for speaking out
I still to fight the battle for those in need reaching out (c'mon)
C-community is they veins and the streets is part of they wrist
The truth is within the heart and the soldiers come with the rest
Now I'm riding in this car on the way to face with Collide (I'm ready)
Even if I lose it all get what's inside the trunk can fly
And I bet they'll remember me, one of the only ones who's self made (Trae)

My vessel is like a fortress fear ain't allowed in it
Cause I'm self made, self paid, no chains can hold me

Flip Side of Reality,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"I'm in a heavy metal vibe in a rage
But since I don't use a guitar, I slam and burn bodies on stage
I shout and spit at these doubting tricks because they counterfeit
I'll swallow dusk speck and knock a ton of dust up out of it
I hold my folder overhead until my shoulders burn
I'll show you what I learned when I get back from the point of no return
My bars be loaded with palsy
My phone works in reverse, so I'll hang up in your face before you call me
Set you in the depths of this medley
Once I lock you in my head G, you'll never leave again like a dead tree
They look at me and say this guy's scary
While you wearing a tiny backpack on books, I carry a library
I stand calm through the chaos and violence
And the only thing that breaks my concentration is silence
Only classic lines rise from my lid
Sometimes I think I wish I thought of that and then I realize that I did

My hand is faster than the eyes, so blink quick
I'm so naturally instinctive that I swing fists before my brain thinks it
The anarchist who ran farthest through the grand darkness
My flow scorches a man's carcass like a pan's sausage
I spark mystical thoughts that rise about the hardest
Raw enough to hide your car inside its own glove compartment
The trained shogun, so approach me real slow son
'Cause I don't even trust the dude who told me to trust no-one
When it leaves my mouth, it doesn't take a strong amount
One ounce of what I douse is like a glass of Kool Aid at Jim Jones' house
You see he's frail, I'm harder than a seashell
With deep spells that let me snatch DNA samples from emails
You're shell-shocked when the spell drops
I almost went to jail for putting a bag of ricin in my own mailbox
You specialise in phrase adoption, I display self-made concoctions
Plus I break scales when I weigh my options

My head spins forwards and backwards on an antenna-like axis
Then I practice writing raps that cause anaphylaxis
The lead professor, I go deeper in each semester
The beat infector, specially trained continent reconnector
My genius stripes been earned, the wisest men learned
At my feet Einstein couldn't have made it as my intern
Verbal infern, no pity or concern
I run circles around you full speed until I melt you with the wind burn
Then send vocals out this world until the Moon is warmer
Walking through metal detectors with a suit of armor
The true performer, writing volumes on a single pad
And to your life, your subtraction is the only thing I'll add
My mind glides like a high-tech design ride
Plus I saw you clear as day from my blind side
I made a big mistake, you're not the guy I meant to help
Disconnected my body parts just to reinvent myself",https://genius.com/K-rino-flip-side-of-reality-lyrics
No Mercy,No Mercy,1999.0,"I ain't no wrestler but I'll body slam MCs with a flow
My clique be running shit like the NWO
No mercy in this rap game I've come with the blade
Fuck some clippers, lyrics sharp enough to tighten your fade
We can trade brains a month just to see who can wreck it
Mines so powerful your fucking head'll bust the first second
I possess syllabic cyanide so rappers dissolve
In the weakest part of my wisdom universes evolve
See I blast into the future, location exact
I'm bringing rhymes from the year 2028 back
Scientists couldn't resist the hypnotism of K
Words travel killing MCs seven planets away
Of the sinister motherfuckers, I'm the chief of the panel
Attacking like atoms cracking where my anger was channelled
You was running but I didn't move and still won the race
Push your head in the cassette and fast forward your face

You motherfuckers better learn my name
Ain't no mercy when you step up in this damn Rap game
All you weak hoes sound the same
It ain't no mercy when you check your basic ass up in the game

Many tried, we can have this battle in or outside
If you rhymed first and died before my turn I wouldn't let you slide
'Cause before they put your ass in the ground
I'll stand over your damn body busting rhymes to win the fucking round
Quick to initiate some bad luck
I got seven personalities and all of 'em is agg as fuck
Lyric addicted so I'll never quit
I'll give you credit though you kinda good, on second thought, ""Man, fuck that shit""
I'll break you in a million parts with my thesis
Then shatter each one of those million broken parts into a million pieces
Just like sports but I got other reasons
I hold the record for the most rappers fucked up in one season
If I don't warn my opponent he's subject to run
See all I said was mic check he said, ""fuck it you won""
Doubled my skills miles per hour so my thoughts improve
Making me counteract before you make your first move

You motherfuckers better learn my name
Ain't no mercy when you step up in this damn Rap game
All you weak hoes sound the same
It ain't no mercy when you check your basic ass up in the game

I'm in South Park Coalition bound
S.P.C. till they put me in the ground
I'm in South Park Coalition bound
S.P.C. till they put me in the ground

You can't handle the hell I make while I verbally telestrate
Scholars wonder how I persist to go deeper yet elevate
Honestly, physically, mentally no rappers astonish me
In a room one thousand images of K, now which one is me?
In a zone too powerful to withstand it alone
Your panic was shown, I swing microphones turning planets to stone
Vanished and gone to oblivion, never energized
The only way I'll let you win is if the winner dies
Instrumental fiending to blast like a gun slug
My radio was still bumping while it was unplugged
No battery, miraculous scripture composer excel higher
Injecting countless kilograms of Hell fire
Hallucinate the points where you're doubting reality
Rappers be scrap to me emphatically shattered anatomies
Understand I'm busting like a harpoon
I was born in South Park but I ain't talking about that cartoon
No Mercy

You motherfuckers better learn my name
Ain't no mercy when you step up in this damn Rap game
All you weak hoes sound the same
It ain't no mercy when you check your basic ass up in the game

I'm in South Park Coalition bound

Verbal Execution,Danger Zone,1995,"One of these right hooks damages ya spinal system
Bring me the most powerful minds, I’ll twist ‘em
Like Eastwood, I’m gunning but I’m making a list of scholars
Choking necks so I’ll leave with 'A Fistful of Collars'
Dollars after the jacking, hollers after attacking
Mental capacity is lacking
Nothing will see your word drowning
Spirits surrounding and ninety thousand lyrics were found in
And pounding them with verbal boulders
Ten black folders, a million mad marching Muslim soldiers
Sacrifices, jack devices, attacks all twices
Hard to stop when this lyric hacks and slices
Throats stronger than Conan
Rhyme like a blizzard so I’m called the Abominable Flowman
Never lie, status as a legend is verified
Receive resurrection I’m the Devil and terrify
Pouncing a man, even a woman I’m trouncing her
And boy there’s a mystical mass murderer councillor
Stood in the mirror, look deep for protection
But dimensions from other mirrors murdered my reflection

The Verbal Executioner
K-Rino is the Verbal Executioner
K-Rino is the Verbal Executioner
K-Rino is the Verbal Executioner

Telepathy lets me levitate, reveal then revelate
Body stays down, brain elevates
Mercenary mad missile aimer
A game of Russian Roulette killed him with nothing in the chamber
But shot him up, as far as rhymes go you ain’t got enough
To burn me, the center of the Sun ain’t hot enough
Picture me, the pinnacle of lyrical wizardry
So advanced that my mental  future is history
So, all you get is a free jab
Verses I beat ‘em with left his vocab in the rehab
Yo, after the battle I had his tongue sterilized
He walked away but his shadow was paralyzed
Pain will leave the punishment permanent
Cause of death, doctors from other planets couldn’t determine it
Life loss was all he was managing
Stick-and-move tactics damaged him ‘cause my body kept vanishing
And vanishing, rhyming in French, Greek and Spanish and
Latin, any MC that steps up I’ll flatten him with
Dynamite, for tryna fight back you ain’t coming right
Yo, vocal assassin, competition gon’ die tonight


Confessions of a rhyme killer, you hear me and hate
Words of power, wack styles deteriorate
My weak opponent annoyed me
Pulled out his pistol but the bullets just curved to avoid me
I once had to write a page in two minutes
I’m so dope time stood still and waited 'til I was finished
I’m the Dragon, Enter me
Physically I’m here but mentally in the womb for a century
Developing power in the cerebellum
Destruction is automatic, in conflicts somebody better tell ‘em
Terrible temperamental catastrophe, terminal torture flurry
Your opponents worry, biters evacuate in a hurry
Horrible, hideous, horrendous, vocally tremendous
Standing firm with Allah to defend us
Bite a verse, I’ll punch you in the face and bloody it
Universe, I’ll bust in outer space and study it
Planet after planet, K-Rino it’s accrued as the meanest
Nobody seen us when we tortured MCs on Venus
Travel light years, my styles still work for me
Mainly here to mix up my massacre on Mercury
Skip the Moon, genius is for planets, I left doom
I resume by following the greatest on Neptune
Mental karate followed up with verbal judo
Is what I use when I punish the powers of Pluto
Years of rhyme war damaged my thought pattern
Causing me to almost lose when I fought Saturn
Brain rejuvenation made my actions heinous
One verse destroyed Jupiter and Uranus
The Executioner, horrible planet defender
Mars heard what I’d done and they just surrendered
Now I’m on Earth in Vietnam stage
Pen is filled with gas, write on a nuclear bomb page",https://genius.com/K-rino-verbal-execution-lyrics
Abnormal,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"I use a vain tube and drain you, leave a painful stain through
To the angle it came through, flames grew and left a birth rain out in plain view
The verbal threat they ain't heard of yet, no telling how wet your shirt'll get
Decapitate you and empty out your turtleneck
My obsession to be great sparks earthquakes
Irate the judge after the battle 'cause I wasn't satisfied winning first place
I feed on atoms and molecules and operate on fools
Who don't follow rules with the same ancient tools that the scholars use
We can let our thoughts wrestle
Ya chest'll bust and after all they'll find is a verse nestled in a gutted vessel
I supernaturally tackle dreams, stood alone and shackle teens
And by 19 I sprouted pterodactyl wings
The toxins locked in my doctrine chop skin like a crock spin
And mock men until they drop like stock options
Kill paragraphs with orgasmic compounds
I'm not Jesus but I fed multitudes with four verbs and one noun
Wow, you susceptible to unaffectable
Methods that skips steps and fast forwards the inevitable
Triggers on weapons pull till your naked's full
Of unacceptable geometrical wounds that are non-correctable
My skill pinnacle amounts to the highest number math can count to
Which is infinite and all I let was an ounce through
I throw a turbulent word at ya
Unearthing ya with circular inertia that's certain to murder the perjurer

Abnormal, we bomb your ear with abnormal wordplay
Until the drum will click at your brain like a survey
It hit your hypothalamus after the third day
And stimulate you with an obscene absurd way

I defeated the speed of his reading with a _____ conceitedness
That enters pregnant wombs and switches the fetuses
I start fiending for carrageenans and ejaculate the rarest semen
Each phrase that I'm dreaming has a pair of meanings
In each meaning has seven interpretations
And all seven interpretations come with eleven explanations
Filled with multiple situations and parables that telepathically carry you
Through the depths of my mental geographical map for you
To dissect and decipher for one rhyme
I have to write a thousand word pieces to accurately define every one line
Extract Fahrenheit from sunlight
And live the life for ten 100 year old individuals all in one night
My Para-digits sparks a collision with Doppler precision
With eyes closed, I still got binocular vision
I hate they ever recorded ya, my voice is a orchestra
That tortures ya until a halo sits to the north of ya
The vociferous G who explicitly disconnects your ethnicity
And baptises you in a pool of electricity
My words are prescribed for sick MCs like medicine
My side effects include legions that burn skin and melt skeletons
And swollen tongues, collapsed lungs, germs that breed and start traveling
And pack the bloodstream with non-retractable pathogens
I'm blasting feminine and masculine and pillaging the illegit
With tyrannous polysyllabic killer spit
Force your spirit to divorce ya
My brain tissue gets damaged then it's rebreeded by atmospheric moisture
You see my face in your speculum, vertebrate have collected 'em
Then the next second I'm recycling your requiem

Abnormal, we bomb your ear with abnormal wordplay
Until the drum will click at your brain like a survey
It hit your hypothalamus after the third day
And stimulate you with an obscene absurd way

Listen Up, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"So you want me to tell you about the place called America, right?
It’s a very very evil place
So many atrocities have been committed by this nation
And the poor people suffer because of the evil evil dragon
Let me tell you
Ha ha ha, oh you don’t believe me?

It’s a population divided over multiple topics
We go through the process, hoping that voting can stop it
Systemic poverty, economics holding us hostage
The rich controlling and watching while they choke us for profits
Deflection is the tool they use to alter the movement
False conclusions like racism is just an illusion
The American flag—blacks don’t believe in that hype
‘Cause we see stars every time we get beat with them stripes
You plotting like hell every time we try to prevail
Now you scared ‘cause people waking up out of the spell
They tell the black man forget what was done to him
They say that just to hide the fact that what was done to blacks was done up under them
See we been picked to be the victims
So begging the system to treat us equal with them is a contradiction
Go and listen to John Ehrlichman who worked for Nixon
Said the war on drugs was meant to lock blacks up and restrict them

Listen up, I’ma tell ya what they won’t tell ya
Slap ya with the raw truth even if it scare ya
We gotta soldier up and go through the heat
How can you wake up when you don’t even know that ya sleep?
Listen up, I’ma tell ya what they won’t tell ya
Slap ya with the raw truth even if it scare ya
We gotta soldier up and go through the heat
How can you wake up when you don’t even know that ya sleep?

“Let’s Make America Great Again”
A coded phrase by racist hateful men who blame the poor citizens for the state it’s in
But we on top of that, got ‘em covered like calamine
Holding up a power fist yelling, “Free Palestine”
We focus on shining and chase showbiz
We know every rapper and actor but don’t know what Jim Crow is
And black people, why you praising the Clintons
When they responsible for jailing you and raising your sentence?
But you sellin’ ya little dope ‘cause you live in the slums
But even in the drug industry, they give you the crumbs
The government decided it then they created this environment
Supplying it, then punish you for selling it or buying it
And I admit that we don’t help our situation
When we contribute knowingly through voluntary participation
Some of us still chase integration but that’s what caused the evisceration
You racist but say you a Christian nation

Listen up, I’ma tell ya what they won’t tell ya
Slap ya with the raw truth even if it scare ya
We gotta soldier up and go through the heat
How can you wake up when you don’t even know that ya sleep?
Listen up, I’ma tell ya what they won’t tell ya
Slap ya with the raw truth even if it scare ya
We gotta soldier up and go through the heat
How can you wake up when you don’t even know that ya sleep?

You lost and you don’t see that what you backing is false
How many blacks been bumped off under the flag and the cross?
For years we’ve been advised about the prison business enterprise
In Michigan they lied ‘bout the water, committed Flinticide
We fight the beast and the ratchet police
From slavery up to now we get attacked in the streets
You can’t compare the Holocaust to the blacks you mistreat
Because in no time, the Jews was right back on their feet
But see in our case, justice wasn’t properly handled
Opportunities blocked even when we go through the channels
Got some rotten politicians who pretended to help
40 million blacks owning 1% of the wealth
You made ‘em rich and as long as they above you, you trapped
You think they love you ‘cause you can dunk or ‘cause you can rap?
So we stay connected to those who deceived and betrayed us
I wish we loved us the way we love the people who hate us

Listen up, I’ma tell ya what they won’t tell ya
Slap ya with the raw truth even if it scare ya
We gotta soldier up and go through the heat
How can you wake up when you don’t even know that ya sleep?
Listen up, I’ma tell ya what they won’t tell ya
Slap ya with the raw truth even if it scare ya
We gotta soldier up and go through the heat
How can you wake up when you don’t even know that ya sleep?",https://genius.com/K-rino-listen-up-lyrics
Speak It,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Don’t be scared to
Talk your dreams into reality, man
How?

Give birth and materialize things in person
Gotta do some inner searching, get up and put the work in
We spend too much time in hope and wish mode
Lamenting over things that we want, never trying to work to get those
Looking at the possessions of others
If you had your own fruit, you wouldn’t sit around questioning another’s
Your lack of productivity is negligence
Some of us lay around as if we’re waiting on a guaranteed inheritance
Man, let me tell you how a goal should be, reached
See it in your mind, form a plan then execute it totally
Oh, and a quick disclaimer, let me say this first
You might have to fail a few times throughout the years before you make it work
Doubtful energy, go to war with yours
If the formula that you drew up was flawed then go back to the drawing board
And know that frustration and doubt is understandable
But keep pushing your plan until your goal is fully tangible

Speak it into existence, conceiving the futuristic
Seek it with true persistence, believe that it’s realistic
Never doubt it a second, go after it, be aggressive
Whatever you visualize, don’t stop until you possess it
Speak it into existence, conceiving the futuristic
Seek it with true persistence, believe that it’s realistic
Never doubt it a second, go after it, be aggressive
Whatever you visualize, don’t stop until you possess it

If you’re hungry you get up and eat
Thirsty, you get up and drink
But when it’s time to do it big, why is it so tough to think?
Why is it so difficult to make a move and see your dreams?
You don’t have a problem putting faith in little easy things
Time to hit that righteous monster lick, not the minor stunts
Time to swing for that homerun and stop tryna bunt
Quittin’ ain’t the answer to your setbacks, we’re all adults
Small minded people live their lives getting small results
Take what you got and do your best, it’s all a start
You’ll be screaming, “Won’t he do it?” Then when he don’t, you fall apart
It was you that shoulda did it, gotta take that step
Part of having faith in god is having faith in yourself
Listen, write your thoughts out, talk then do ‘em
You gotta put those words out there then walk into ‘em
You were destined to be a giant inside the womb
We say be and it is, homie, kun faya kun, yeah

Speak it into existence, conceiving the futuristic
Seek it with true persistence, believe that it’s realistic
Never doubt it a second, go after it, be aggressive
Whatever you visualize, don’t stop until you possess it
Speak it into existence, conceiving the futuristic
Seek it with true persistence, believe that it’s realistic
Never doubt it a second, go after it, be aggressive
Whatever you visualize, don’t stop until you possess it

Speak it into existence, right now you deserve
To fully comprehend the true power of words
The courage to make it happen right now should emerge
Fight the fear inside, overcome that cowardly surge
The same energy you use for your anger and beef
Needs to be redirected at positive things you can reach
Erase people from your circle when they cast they doubt
If you’re sleepy just keep on working ’til you pass straight out
Now you mashing the gas real hard, got off the sofa
Eventually you start noticing your goal getting closer
Steady work brings progress, success is next
But never be satisfied, start a new project
It’s nothing better than that feeling of starting with nothing
Then what you had in your head is there all of a sudden
If you have a brain, you’re in a position to build
Skill plus a strong will equals mission fulfilled, you got to

Speak it into existence, conceiving the futuristic
Seek it with true persistence, believe that it’s realistic
Never doubt it a second, go after it, be aggressive
Whatever you visualize, don’t stop until you possess it
Speak it into existence, conceiving the futuristic
Seek it with true persistence, believe that it’s realistic
Never doubt it a second, go after it, be aggressive
Whatever you visualize, don’t stop until you possess it",https://genius.com/K-rino-speak-it-lyrics
Adrenaline Rush, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Whatever you name, whatever they possess, I encompass it all
It doesn’t matter who, there’s nothing they do that I can’t do
Listen

My wrath is known to land sharper than a javelin thrown
Half my dome is larger than the average home
I got these rappers ‘noyed, plus I slapped this boy
In the chin with a 2 mile trapezoid-shaped asteroid
Iron walls can’t seize through
Grab you and your friend and squeeze you into each other and Siamese you
A human skull versus a diesel
The masterpieces I paint levitate so I've never needed an easel
Some days I flip to the left, black
I kept leaving messages on my phone, but I’m afraid to call myself back
The whole game on my damn shoulder
Ram you like a Land Rover then hide your corpse inside my spam folder
If it’s garbage, I won’t hear it, sometimes I have the wrong spirit
Lose my head and start killing my own lyrics
Beyond your essence, I rocked ya

I slice and stab, ignite the lab with lightening fast adrenaline

They say practice makes perfection
Well that I question ‘cause you’ll never reach, it matters how many sessions you invest in
Every minor success is a blessing, every failure is a lesson
The shoes of greatness are stepped in by the best men
But let’s talk about the way we throttle
MCs with crazy 
novels
 sicker than an 85 pound lady model
And you don’t wanna get unlawful
‘cause I’ma set if off and let a shark chew up and severe your metacarpals
The annular grammar rambler with enough writing stamina
To compare my pamphlets to Britannica
Bars that bite, touch you and grand rush
Grip so tight the jaws of life couldn’t cut you out of my hand clutch
Never contrite when I’m fighting
But if I ever need a knife, I’ll write my name and slice you with the hyphen
Sick and throwed, it’s over when I switch in that mode
When I photobomb, whoever’s in the picture explodes

Because I’m hard, I’m mean, I’m raw, I’m clean
I’m agg, I’m throwed, your darkest dream and all between
I’m nice, I’m mad and twice as bad
I slice and stab, ignite the lab with lightening fast adrenaline

One swing of my hand oughta make taller men stand shorter
Grandfather of manslaughter, reverse avalanche starter
Artificial fictional bars fraud as a half quarter
In war I just laugh harder, y’all runnin’ like bath water
I’m part of the sovereign universal majestic order
Paid homage to passed martyrs who worked for the Blessed Father
Respected in every sort of new genre, impressive author
Got  the art, perfected thoughts in my weapon parlor–tell ‘em
The puzzle pieces of another thesis cover streets with leaflets
As I utter speeches from the upper reaches
I smother three fifths of others’ 
And learn the sequence, uncovered secrets that others sleep with
Steady improving how I do things, powers I’m using
Lets me wear a straightjacket and tie my shoestrings
You loot rings while I dispute kings and shoot tubular beams
That bring soothing while angels upon my roof sing

Because I’m hard, I’m mean, I’m raw, I’m clean
I’m agg, I’m throwed, your darkest dream and all between
I’m nice, I’m mad and twice as bad
I slice and stab, ignite the lab with lightening fast adrenaline",https://genius.com/K-rino-adrenaline-rush-lyrics
Secret War,Mind Vision,2019.0,"For those who don't know what's being done
It's time for me to tell you exactly what's being done
But more importantly, who's the one doing it
And at the same time, tell you a little bit about what they do
And how they try to turn us into that
Let's go, let's go

This is the new normal, everyone's too carnal
When the strong becomes suppressed effects are too harmful
Who are the life-altering pushers of this type of madness?
Black men are glad to put a dress on as a rite of passage
The self-degrading path to cash deeply impacts your mental
The consequential aftermath of this ain't accidental
So senseless we don't even see our own divinity
Defenseless against this war on our masculinity
Who benefits from the bending of our tendencies?
To dominate any of this enemies industries
It's bigger than money and material favors, black
And status in this world 'cos he already gave us that
He baited you with things to alter your behavior track
And make distractions to keep you from claiming greatness back
Covered our eyes so with him we won't break our ties
And never realize that it's in our hands the power lies

We're casualties in a secret war
No, no, no no, no no, no no
Every minute it's just feeling like they keep killing us even more
No, no, no no, no no, no no
They stacking the bodies up like they keeping score
No, no, no no, no no, no no
And every sign that they're showing us daily we ignore
No, no, no no, no no, no no

The fall of the original is scriptural
So now you see us visible before the world carrying out their rituals
The route consists of sex on many casting couches
Luciferian messages encrypted in their outfits
The contract writers who hire you require this
And fly you through the cycle of the Zionist entitlements
Top Rabbis and pedophile Jews
Get their values from the Babylonian Talmud
They don't live by the Torah, they live by these rules
Sex trafficking, raping babies younger than preschool
These principles are used in their control of entertainment
And applied to many who have a desire to be famous
So they pay rappers and actors who are chasing after dreams
Then present you as a girl on the front of a magazine
Now the plan has been employed, leaving manhood void
So in the eyes of black boys the male image is destroyed

We're casualties in a secret war
No, no, no no, no no, no no
Every minute it's just feeling like they keep killing us even more
No, no, no no, no no, no no
They stacking the bodies up like they keeping score
No, no, no no, no no, no no
And every sign that they're showing us daily we ignore
No, no, no no, no no, no no

See, rap music is buried in a feminized era
Experimental chemicals like Depo-Provera
Are used scientifically as a medical weapon
To shift our testosterone levels into recession
They lie and twist the truth plus they're able to comatose it
And scientific proof is still labeled as homophobic
So now you stand afraid to say what's in ya
'Cos you know speaking against the gay agenda may offend the paper spenders
The great pretenders push abomination
This song was made to conjure conversation, not for hate and condemnation
When you love people you handle them with patience
'Cos it's not OK to blame the uneducated for Satan's machinations
The scheme against the black family smoked us
The hood is broke and hopeless and self respect is no longer the focus
But truth can end the hypnosis though some damage has been done
But how can you fight a war if you don't even know you in one

We're casualties in a secret war
No, no, no no, no no, no no
Every minute it's just feeling like they keep killing us even more
No, no, no no, no no, no no
They stacking the bodies up like they keeping score
No, no, no no, no no, no no

Blow up overnight? Boy, hey man the game don't work like that for real
There's a lot to this game that you don't understand. I've been in this game a long time

You ain't ready, you ain't ready

This game ain't what you think it is dude, it's so deep
You ready to grind all day and night and get no sleep?
Push from the ground up to make your city proud
Rock the stage with only 10 or 12 people in the crowd
Stay true and do things that other artists wouldn't even do
Deal with family members and friends who don't believe you
Practice with all your might to make your lyrics tight
Work on one verse a whole night just to get it right
All the ups and the downs, the frustration and the stressing
Bad promo investments, long studio sessions
You ready for them tough shows and hating crowd tripping?
What about when the mic goes out or your CD starts skipping?
Jealous and lazy rappers in your clique mad because you hot
Holding the group back because they ain't got the drive you got
How you gon' to feel when it goes to happiness to not fun
Tryna hustle CDs and nobody will buy one

You think you ready for this grind boy? (You ain't ready)
Ready to put all that time boy? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
You think you ready for the game fool? (He ain't ready)
The disappointments and pain fool? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV

What's gon' happen when you dropped the best song you ever made?
And the DJ tell you, you got to pay him to get it played
When you getting a few shows and you still ain't ahead
And 30 club promoters tryna cheat you out your bread
Are you mentally prepared for what you plan on pursuing?
Are you strong enough to handle if the crowd starts booing?
This ain't a joke, sooner than later you'll realize
You're putting yourself out there for the world to criticize
Can you handle the pressure that comes with being an artist?
Reading internet comments about how your album is garbage
You ready to hit the road for two months to push a record?
Signing a contract before you let your lawyer check it?
Cats bootlegging your CD's at the hood corner stores
Somebody with no talent getting rich off yours
Are you ready for that deal that's going to get you some juice
And not even owning the songs that you wrote and produced

You think you ready for this grind boy? (You ain't ready)
Ready to put all that time boy? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
You think you ready for the game fool? (He ain't ready)
The disappointments and pain fool? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV

Are you ready for that quick fame that comes up on you?
Fans who love you one year, but next year turn on you
All them blood sucking friends tryna use and leech ya
People hitting you up wanting free shows and features
When the hood tell you you capping and you no longer down
Can you not cheat on your woman when there's groupies around?
When your label tells you you're too hard, you're too strong
Are you ready to sell your soul to make so some satanic songs?
What you gon' do when you're tired and fans approach you
Are you ready to take pictures and sign thousands of posters
Take you a seat, this game was born in the streets
It ain't soft and sweet, can you handle drama and beef?
What's gon' happen when there's no more cars and no more blinging?
When the girls stop screaming and the phone stops ringing
You ready for this lifestyle or just blowing smoke
Selling a million records and still being broke

You think you ready for this grind boy? (You ain't ready)
Ready to put all that time boy? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV
You think you ready for the game fool? (He ain't ready)
The disappointments and pain fool? (Hell naw!)
You think the game is all pretty and sweet
It ain't nothing like that fake sh' you see on TV",https://genius.com/K-rino-you-think-you-ready-lyrics
Street Corner Flows,The Hit List,2004.0,"Uh-huh uh-huh, uh man
I'm mad, I'm mad uh

I say, people be wondering who the best is
Look at that boy I just battled and then go ask him where his chest is
I smash fools 'cause I'm Jurassic
They gon' have to bury your body and your ass in two separate caskets
Shock resistant heat starter
A threat to take a bath with plugged up electric appliances in the water
My rhymes are like crack, against the law
Young players get took to jail just for having K inside the car
I make a time machine and blast off
Go to the future, catch your grandkids rapping and bump they ass off
MCs get hooked when I rain on ‘em
These rappers take my rhymes to motel rooms and run a train on 'em
Call me the style metamorphian
Subject to evolve into a bionic bullet releasing scorpion
Got to impress you when I'm in the square
If my rhymes ain't rough enough, I might just vanish into thin air

Y'all don't wanna run up on K-Rino
Keep that mainstream shit, I'm bringing street corner flow
Lyrical manslaughter, no time for game playing
Round after round bucking 'em down, so what you saying?

I kick a thousand with none wack
Understand virgins listen to my words and get pregnant on contact
Swallowed by flows, now you feeling doubt
My rhymes like cancel pack and sick killer bees eating your stomach out
No matter what city or state
Wreck any rapper breathing, lose - I got a trick of pot of boiling water straight
You either die now or die later
I slap a hater, G and I put that on your old lady vibrator
Got more ingredients than gumbo
You bring them rhymes up in the paint, I bet I swat 'em like Mutumbo
I might inflict lyrics that kill fast
And Ms. Cleo couldn't predict how many times these hands gon' touch your ass
No need to call me, I'm the best at this
See all I got to do is scare people thoughts to check my messages
You could be asleep, I'll still get with you though
I'll take a nap, meet you in your own dream and come and get you hoe

Y'all don't wanna run up on K-Rino
Keep that mainstream shit, I'm bringing street corner flow
Lyrical manslaughter, no time for game playing
Round after round bucking 'em down, so what you saying?

They can't identify the gifted ace
I fake ‘em out because I wake up every morning with a different face
I snatch punks and hit the kill switch
Fuck a picture on a milk carton, they gon' find his ass inside that bitch
It ain't no use for you to try and hide
It's South Park Russian roulette player, take turns inhaling cyanide
I'm gunning fools down at high noon
My promotion's so strong, I got posters and shit all on the Moon
You wanna run up on a thought spinner
They'll show the highlights of me dogging these silly rappers on SportsCenter
Roaches be dying from the way I spit
My rhyme's so dangerous you got to wear a rubber when you play my shit

Y'all don't wanna run up on K-Rino
Keep that mainstream shit, I'm bringing street corner flow
Lyrical manslaughter, no time for game playing
Round after round bucking 'em down, so what you saying?

Y'all don't wanna run up on K-Rino

Feel My Flow,No Mercy,1999.0,"Oh I, I think I betta let y'all know
Them fools should have let me go
So now they gots to feel my flow
K-Rino, K-Rino

My motives are magnetic, let 'em affect their cerebellum
Persecutors suffer the verses impact before I spit 'em
Radioactively contaminate MCs saying they cracked us
Shift rhymes and reverse click and say 'em backwards
I punish a faker for years before I let up
The referee could count for 2 months, he ain't gonna get up
I'm trained well, my every brain cell contains Hell
Flames dwell inside of my cranium, hear my name bell
Kill a verb known to recite irresistible words
By day I'm K-Rino, by night an invisible bird
Incredible artistic rap scientifical mission
Displaying futuristic x-ray peripheral vision
Yet blindly searching for styles to undermine me
Plant lyrics in the ground, add water and grow a rhyme tree
Nerves split unauthorized verse reading forbidden
Witness the folder where the ancient rap secrets are hidden
My Black Book details accounts of the collars I bruised
Poetic scriptural arrangement left scholars confused
Unsolved mysteries so average lyricists doubt me
If I can't think my book will create the rhymes without me
Styles like punches so let's step in a ring and quote 'em
My battles large enough to let Don King promote 'em
Rapped in my past life, made coroners miss it
Dug the casket up a week later, my body was missing

Oh I, I think I betta let y'all know
Them fools should have let me go
So now they gots to feel my flow
K-Rino, K-Rino

Rapidly my knowledge reaching new planes
Doctors x-rayed my skull and discovered that I had 2 brains
Respect the man checking in wrecking land
Imagine murder millenniums within a 5-second span
I yell out through my full reign and strike slaying
You sell out like a Bull's game with Mike playing
They blowing taps when I start the creation of raps
Victims are crushed by extreme gravitation collapse
I see the flatline, I hear no responses and flee
Rhyme sleeping gas, everybody unconscious but me
I deciphered astrological rhyme codes
The main subject of deep experimental mind probes, yo
Words like brass knuckles left that head knotted
Waking up at night to catch my Black Book floating over my body
My verses hypnotize 'em, MCs be laying down
Screamin like they fallin off a building but they on the ground
Talented battlists, professor game shower, the main flower
My rhymes melted opponents like a flame thrower
Breathing the fire on the mic vocals burning the stage
Lyrical genius reading books without turning the page
Convert to ghost form, the agg ways seem to worsen
Saying my name on Tuesday makes me appear in person
Wrote it and flowed it, activate greater vocal aerobics
Scanning your microscopic brain got me claustrophobic
Pillage your rep, never step where the pressure was kept
Telescope placed in my conscious to measure the depth
You want to kill me that's cool I know it's true
But when you do I'm coming back as a bullet to murder you

Oh I, I think I betta let y'all know
Them fools should have let me go
So now they gots to feel my flow

When You Hate To Love,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Yeah
Sometimes we gotta go hear mayne
I hope this should help somebody

She was perfect growing up angelic beyond clean
High school vailed Victorian prom queen
Met a fella got took fast dreams of polish
Introduce her the drugs, sophomore year in college
Dropped out back in the hood the streets sweep her
Momma let her back in the house thought she could help her
The summer seemed crazy but trusting her seemed dumber
As soon as she went to sleep started stealing cash from her
Gone three or four days straight no sunshine
Selling what was left of her body for one dime
Told her mother she was rehabbing but she was lying
Whenever she came around she burned her each time
One night she was walking the street roaching for bread
They raped beat her up real bad left her for dead
Stumbled to her mother's house once more this time she said
""I love you but you can't come in I'll pray for you"" and shut the door

Sometimes you hate to love
Cause it's such a confusing thing
How can something that's made for us
Turn around and cause us pain
Sometimes the greatest love
Is the kind that hurts the most
But when it seems it's far away
That's the time it's really close

This young boy had it all not many youngsters had more
Was raised up receiving whatever he asked for
The pride of his father big plans they both had
Roaming him to be a star athlete just like dad
He was on the right path the dream realization
By twelve grade recruited by every school in the nation
He was Spalding arrogant felt the world was his Playstation
Went to jail first time after a street altercation
His daddy came and bailed him straight out, jelly he worked it
Knew it had to be a misunderstanding his son's perfect
But the opposite of perfect they started to see signs
Then the next six months he got arrested three times
Daddy saved him from a big drug charge just throwed incur
But the robbery him and his boys pulled off was the last straw
Heart-broken when he got that call
His son crying on the phone, his father said ""It's time you're on your own""


The next story is the deepest of all it gets harder
A single mother living alone with a young daughter
A new dude comes into the picture and bring author
Become the perfect man a provider and step-father
But when the mother left him alone the worst happened
He would do thing to this child no one ever imagined
Defenseless against this and robbed her for incidents
Permanent scars lifelong night marriage remembrance
Inside her, nothing would ever be like thing were
Never told a soul scared that her mother would blame her
Cause he told that in daily more reserve she became
The mood of the household started to feel strange
Mother's intuition kicked in she discovered what it was
Found an under gourmet in the clothes hamper spotted with blood
Ran in her daughter's room demanded answers at once
The child broke down and told her ""what's been happening for months? ""
Left her feeling like she fell unprotected child from home
When the man returned home, the police was waiting for him
Gave up the love she thought that she had but meanwhile
She got a painfully attempt to repair her broken child",https://genius.com/K-rino-when-you-hate-to-love-lyrics
Tied In,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes

Yo, this brother was a perpetrator, petty crime-ass trick
Hanging with the clique but riding much dick
Quick to get kicked in the face over jack
So he left the pack to try to sell his own crack
Started in the hood, made a couple of G's
That's when the true soldiers came and put his shit on freeze
Cashed out the minute that he pedalled his last rock
Make one more cent in that spot, get his ass dropped
So he thought, ""Nah, this ain't gonna work""
Got his nuts out the dirt, then he called his brother Bert
Bert had the hook-ups, the bank, the guns and the clip
The hoes, the grip and fiends on his tip
In my opinionation the high capper blows in
When he walks trough a door that locks when you close it
But that's coinciding with slanging and riding
It was dope that was guiding a life he was tied in, kick it

Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes

Yo, my boy was paid, now the game was clear
Made more money in an hour than you'd make in a year
Fear was no factor, ain't nobody gonna hit ya
When ya walking with thirty more motherfuckers with ya
Knocking out brothers in a club parking lot
Many freaks got slapped and many perpetrators got shot
He had the game down packed, so cold in his mind
That Bert would let him run the show from time to time
And that's when the boy got lazy
Too much power made his ass go crazy
Bert went out of town just to make one drop
But hoping he'd meet a cop, oh boy set up the new shop
And that shit was wack life
Bank they made, he got paid but took his cut like a jackknife
Two grand a day he was hiding
It's like suicide in the life he was tied in, kick it

Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes
Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes

Yeah, he's making all the dough
And to top it all off he was fucking Bert's main hoe
So when he came back he was pissed
And the crew had wrote the new kid's name on a death list
His scared face provoked a threat
He was the only motherfucker in the room who broke a sweat
No ass kissing, no reminiscing
Just explain how the fuck 17 grand was missing
Grabbed his gun and tried to pull it out
Slick-ass trick that he was boning that night, she took his bullets out
Click, click, they sucked him up, bucked him up
To make a long story short, man they fucked him up
Strapped his ass behind a Mack truck
Making it worse, they hit reverse and cold backed up
Over his chest and all blood is what he lied in
His stupid ass died in a life he was tied in, kick it

Money, hoes, cars, clothes
Living in the Park that's the way shit goes

Living in the Park that's the way shit goes",https://genius.com/K-rino-tied-in-lyrics
Intervention,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"I woke up around noon to a strange situation
Heard voices in my house having a full conversation
I peeked down the hallway with nervous hesitation
And since I live alone, what could be the explanation?
It sounded like an argument, a glarin' dispute
I saw a man with a notepad wearing a suit
Time to face the fear and get to this hysterious route
That's when I seen him lookin' like preparin' to shoot
It was disorderly
The mental shock kicked in horribly
One acted deplorably, another spoke cordially
Started to notice something as they sat me down forcefully
I was being scolded and reprimanded by four of me
One of 'em was so aggravated that I could feel it
Said ""You got a lot of deep down issues you need to deal with""
Airin' everything out today was the intention
It was me against me, they were doing an intervention
Like

Please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth
Need you to please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth

The first me was like ""Now K, you know we love you
I mean us, you know what I mean but because you
Been holdin' in a lot of internal stresses and drama
Each one of us represents a part of your persona
I asked him, ""Which part are you?"" As I sat tight
He said, ""I'm every failure you ever suffered in your life
All the way from childhood up to last October
Which created a depression that you haven't gotten over""
The next me was volatile and said, ""I don't blame you""
Cussin' and goin' off, I said ""Who are you?"" He said ""Anger
And all the situations you never got off your chest
Got repressed 'cause you kept it in and you never expressed""
Was he justified bein' this bad? He might be
He was actin' like he wanted to fight, but fight me
The third one was quiet and passive and sayin' nothing
The guy in the suit was me too, mediating the discussion
Like...

Please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth
Need you to please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth

As they all talked one by one, stating the facts
I realized each of them symbolized what held me back
The depression from my failures made me negative
And the anger that I had made it difficult to forgive
The quiet and timid me finally spoke and I was swept up
Said he was born out of the times I didn't step up
Aspects of me that circumstances would breed
They hated being around me and all wanted to leave
They lived in me for years, experiencing the pain
It was time to eradicate them, that's the reason they came
I explained to 'em all, ""I'm not perfect or fake
And I take full weight for every single mistake""
As I talked I could see they were starting to understand it
And slowly each one of them then started to vanish
Then it became clear as the man in the suit dimmed
That I was the one doing the intervention on them
Like..

Please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth
Need you to please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth
Please intervene, no doubt
Got a lot of things that I need worked out
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
It's a cold, cold world
Like
Please intervene, no doubt (It's a cold, cold world)
Got a lot of things that I need worked out (It's a cold, cold world)
Now I'm here sitting down on this couch (It's a cold, cold world)
Listenin' to everybody run they mouth (It's a cold, cold world)",https://genius.com/K-rino-intervention-lyrics

K-Rino, SPC
Underground network
Fearless

For what it's worth, they fake like the Earth they shake
I'm blowing bastards out like candles on a birthday cake
Leave my foes in the red, scared because I rose from the dead
I got a plant that generates flows, it grows in my head
I got enemies plotting my murder, opposing in line
I cause threatening epidemics by exposing the line
I’ve been chosen to find a concept that explodes in the mind
A rhyme waiting in 2009, frozen in time
My main woman got a .45 and a knife in her purse
I’ll take it to ya death and make you live ya life in reverse
God's blessing, I hold back from adolescence to old
Ya life’s payment is overdue, I’m repossessing your soul
The lesson was told, so I let the drama unfold
And stuff 79 cadavers in a 20 inch hole
When it’s over I write a verse to celebrate what I done
I’m scared one day I’ll accidentally elevate to the Sun

It’s madness
These'll fools never comprehend
It’s madness
My words can kill a hundred men

I speak violent tones that snap collar bones
Smother your voice till your holler's gone and all that you can conjure up is a silent moan
I’m a delusional depiction, a mirage
A pictureless collage dressed In ghostly camouflage
You seem animate with this dream programmer
I’m an extre show slammer with supreme flow grammar
The man with the logic, yet I’m still damaging topics
I can make my molecules merge with inanimate objects
I stand exactly behind the man that plans to gat me
I hold conversations with the Moon and it speaks back at me
My thoughts soar, still I explore the ocean’s floor
My diary had my life wrote in it before I bought it from the store
To make contintents nervous was my assumed purpose
I deliver disasters on silver platters like room service
Cause comatose conditions when the rough parts hit ya
I’ll blow out my own brain so I can share my thoughts with ya
(Haha hold up, hold up mayne, you gotta give me that last line again mayne
I can’t let you bring this hook in just yet, K)
I said something ‘bout I’ll split ya
I’ll blow out my own brain so I can share my thoughts with ya

It’s madness
These fools never comprehend
It’s madness
My words can kill a hundred men

If you diss me, I’m gonna ride
I’m a live version of a nightmare being trapped at a high tide homicide personified
I reduce rookies to fumes when the lyrical gun booms
And I locked up a million wack rappers in one room
When I close the doors, the temperature soears
It’s burning like microwave horns, radiation exposed to unclosed pores
And the louder the threats, no sweat, the louder my laughter get
I’ll turn into some letters and hide inside the alphabet
And when I see you, I’ma probably swarm
And make myself spell into words that inflict bodily harm
I killed fakes with speeches that flow 'til they filled lakes
I’m a blender, vocally smashing brains to milkshakes

It’s madness
These fools never comprehend
It’s madness
My words can kill a hundred men",https://genius.com/K-rino-madness-lyrics
Time To Grow Up,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"What's the science? I wasn't gonna say nothing but now it's time
Grown people functioning with teenager minds
If you think it's cool little do you know
Your room still looking like it did twenty years ago
When you talk about coming up fast, we just ignore you
Your baby brother and sister done moved out before you
You still at home cranking up drama
Sneaking a thirty-year old woman in talking about ""Shh, don't wake my momma""
Got the nerve to try to have some animosity
Bumping heads with her cause you feeling like she don't respect your privacy
How could you even have the nerve to say that?
The water bill was twelve dollars a month and you couldn't even pay that
Your future we goin pray for it (that's a shame)
It's bad enough to write your name on the juice but it's worse when you ain't pay for it
So pick ya draws off the floor you're full grown H
Your son is eighteen and he already got his own place

You ain't a youngster no more stop try'na flash back
Still living in the past cause your present ain't jack
It's time to face facts, grow up and meet trials
Understand you too old to be living like a child

Hold up mama now you out of order
You forty-three why you going clubbing with'cha twenty-year old daughter?
To see it was embarrassing and flat-out silly
She said ""Don't we look like twins?"" I said ""Not really""
She's on the floor with her young cat popping and ticking
You screaming out ""What y'all know about that funky chicken?"" (Oh my goodness)
When the song got fast she moved slow as molasses
Gyrating and shaking all four of her asses
Man she need to chill, she's getting phone numbers and making bills
In the bathroom try'na buy some pills
Her drink consumption heightened, and that's when the night got exciting
Walked out the club man and momma fighting
She split them tight pants, them three young kicks didn't stand a chance
Mama old but she still got them hands (woo)
She went straight to jail and called her daughter, the bailer had to borrow
Got out drunk asking ""Where we going tomorrow?""

You ain't a youngster no more stop try'na flash back
Still living in the past cause your present ain't jack
It's time to face facts, grow up and meet trials
Understand you too old to be living like a child

Please tell me why dude
You thirty-three and yo mama's car is still riding by your old high school
How you going take a lady out and you ain't got a quarter?
Your dinner budget is Ramen noodles and a bottle of water
And something else that makes me mad enough to throw blows
Women who dress they four-year-old daughters in old clothes
Say what'cha wanna say
Girl you got kids, why the hell is you on MySpace posing in some lingerie?
Your homeboys is at work you on the corner mane
How you goin wait until you thirty-eight to join a gang?
She got the words 'freak' tatted on her ass cheek
Don't try to act like that's old, you got that last week
I can't believe you still as wild
It's crazy when ya youngest baby is the same age as your grandchild
Dude on the phone faking a call
Catching the bus every weekend just to bullet teenagers at the mall

You ain't a youngster no more stop try'na flash back
Still living in the past cause your present ain't jack
It's time to face facts, grow up and meet trials
Understand you too old to be living like a child",https://genius.com/K-rino-time-to-grow-up-lyrics
Transcendent,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?
Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?

Yeah
What does it mean to be transcendent?
It simply means any error that ever existed you can stand in it
I am the man who brings color to the bland image
Determined to make originality a pandemic
How do you do it? Place yourself in every known time
To accomplish this you have to think beyond your own mind
The real truth with the gifts the creator deals you
And while you live, choose to make music that will outlive you
Hard to compare you, it’s a spiritual battle
What you unravel alters the course individuals travel
Straight blessed with high levels of excellence sustained
And the standards that you established, that precedent remains
Not afraid to be original, style standing alone
They don’t wait to see what others are doing, they set the tone
Socially, politically, athletically fashion the music
The greats don’t follow trends, they give birth to movements

Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?
Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?

What does it mean to be transcendent?
Never placing yourself in a box, the intention is to expand limits
Having that gift that they call vision
When they play your songs, you, your children and your grandchildren can all listen
For every topic there’s a record they can play
Your voice being heard somewhere every second of the day
Your impactful words have people affected in a way
That their behavior patterns change and they reflect on what you say, and
Everyday other will listen they’ll discover you
And fall in love with you, scholars and college students study you
Though not necessarily famous or smartest, your works exalted
And immortalized by painters and artists
And triggering every emotional feeling on the spectrum
Intercepting the world’s pressures, hoping to redirect ‘em
And what you give ‘em, you nice, raising religion
And pays homage to the God who placed you in that position
So tell me

Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?
Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?

Critics malign you and no single category defines you
Your mind unleashes future new breeds coming behind you
With bills steadily faded or outdated, you’ll never be
Your words are medicine and your music will serve as therapy
And the only common rule is that you did it how you wanna do
They all respond to you, people from every country honor you
And some won’t understand and abandon you but the true won’t
They remember all the words to your songs, even when you don’t
They appreciate the value and back you with no issue
They roll with you forever, evolve and grow with you
You never fade with unlimited homage being paid
The talent that comes away for the message to be conveyed
Many people being saved, you speakin’ out on what matters
Ascending the the stratosphere of legendary status
Everybody wants to meet you, accomplishments go unequaled
And the greatest thing about you is you did it for the people, man

Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?
Will the history of your life be written down?
Will they speak of you a hundred years from now?
Will what you do stay relevant and eternally last?
Will you make your own way or just follow the same path?",https://genius.com/K-rino-transcendent-lyrics

Pathetic methods get shredded up by a billion pellets
To pass my easiest class you need a million credits
The ever living sick reverend with unreal genetics
Slap you off of stretcher then go kill the medic
Trap you in high degree raps
'cause if my height was based on intellectual deepness the sea would be at my kneecaps
Some say I'm basic but when there's hatred my style is crazy
Crazy like placing a pregnant lady inside the baby
You can't describe the way we controlling the climate daily
Like an unplugged radio, it won't work when you try to play me
Your life will end if you ever glance at my mic again
And when I'm writing I'm guarded by 20 trifling rifle men
The war driven bar wiz
Lock you up and make you do 10 hard years before I tell you what the charge is
Beyond Atlantis, forming rants that can jump from the canvas
Encompass planets with incomparable quantum mechanics

Leave your whole empire flat with no time to fire back
Aggressive inspired raps embedded like tyre tracks
You ask if I'm the highest, there's no need to inquire that
Your spine I'll be flying that, my mind is an iron trap

I'm resubmitting these to those who don't believe what's written
I got so much depth that you don't even perceive the hidden
Way up to D-E-P-T-H in the previous line
Strategically phrasing it out in my devious mind
I made this blend with my favorite pen, your chin I'll cave in
With a Matrix spin, the ref labeled it a flagrant 10
You never seen a realer rap demeanor, don't drink Aquafina
The black hyena with a body snatching vacuum cleaner
You done came in the cipher wrong,  in the cyclone type of zone
Leave the mic alone before I silence you like the letter X in the word Xylophone
My status rules classical battle patterns embarass you
Tearing the rarest dudes wearing a pair of Franco Harris shoes
My numbers astound with a thunderous sound
I make flood waters originate from under the ground
I put you in a trapezius sleeper hold
Cadaver dogs you'll need for those 3 below catalogs 

Leave your whole empire flat with no time to fire back
Aggressive inspired raps embedded like tyre tracks
You ask if I'm the highest, there's no need to inquire that
Your spine I'll be flying that, my mind is an iron trap

Of course I'm kind of morbid, when I rip spines they forfeit
My mind stretches so far you can zip line across it
A library of nifty tapes I quickly make
You could start reading the list today and by the time you finish you'll be 68
I'll end it with my infamous imprints
Severely injured by the tempest that exist in my intellectual template
Your life's a waste a taste just like rice cakes
I make the mic break just like the ankles of sumo wrestlers on ice skates
Once I choose ya you're an automatic loser
Just like a fool in a staring contest versus Medusa
Before you try what I'ma drop
You'd rather shower in the fluid from a stopped car in the summer when it's running hot
I stand and think 'til all cowards extinct
Got a thermos that stays full no matter how much I drink
Nothing inadvertent my power's certain
Keeping working my nerves and get a hurting red squirting all over your 

Leave your whole empire flat with no time to fire back
Aggressive inspired raps embedded like tyre tracks
You ask if I'm the highest, there's no need to inquire that
Your spine I'll be flying that, my mind is an iron trap",https://genius.com/K-rino-enter-the-iron-trap-lyrics
Firing Squad,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"Them killers I’m send ‘em, murder coming with ‘em
Sixteen deadly venoms  when I hit ‘em
Twenty ni**as die when I loose-leaf and pen ‘em
Spirits die too when I Bruce Lee and end ‘em
My firing squad hard, ya ni**as we don’t 
Your body get burnt, charred, you’re screaming “Oh Lord”
Hit ‘em with the cannon, they existed no more
Nuclear bombs, no ceiling, no floors
Body count more when the horror 
More than the , f*ck a folklore
F*ck a front door, blood we want more
Half the world dance ’til I want a encore
You ni**as ain’t ready, my  heavy
Burst like confetti when I swing my machete
Then I’ma let ‘em loose, a hundred mad yetis
And level mo’ sh*t than a New Orleans levee

Everybody know my mind so gone
It’s known every line so strong
People wanna know why I grind so long
Dammit, I’m a shooter with a blindfold on
Tryna beef with me, these emcees ain’t even on my frequency
SPC killers are increasingly more beastly
Wannabe Gs wouldn’t last one week with me
When I turn my mic on and shocked on it
When I’m through speaking a beat, got knots on it
I’m dropping soul pain, it’s hot in your brain
I snatch your collarbone off like a gold chain
I smoke lots of fellas like mozzarella
Whether killin’ a instrumental or it’s a cappella
You're not better plus your whole block is yellow
By the way, his wife’s a widow, I forgot to tell her
The things my pen do I teach in ten schools
Harder than a drunk dude tryna do a spin move
Every month, day, hour and minute I improve
You brand new to having some hype, I been cool
I’m starving and looking at you with a Ginsu
But ten fools talking sh*t on a menu
I set bombs off to explode in a venue
And sick rhyme serial killers on kin too

I destroy you on that pool table, teach you not to ever step
I’m a legend in this game, only preceded by my rep
I got style, I got skills, but that don’t even tell half the story
Usually I’m not one to brag, those that know me do it for me
Like a silent assassin, I just let my game talk
Playing at a high level, way before I learned to walk
If you gotta challenge me, you might as well just sell your soul
Make that  do what I want, just like I had a remote control
People always asking, “How you learn to shoot that way?”
I just make it look easy, but it ain’t easy, player, like Rapper K
Really it’s just a gift from God, and if I’m gonna keep it real
I have to say I learned from the best, RIP AC Chill

SPC mo’ still on the scene
Chucky the Killer, murder one, come like sniper
K-Rino, Ganksta N-I-P and   their team
That’s the firing squad, we got them F16s
I f*ck with my team tough, I stay on the scene rough
Kill a motherf*cker tryna call my bluff
I’m too much to be touched, I splash his ab quick
My heart won’t tip when I walk in this b*tch
I’m not programmed for all that bullsh*t
I shotty him quick and I call it quits
With that lyrical venom, I’m about to hit ‘em and split ‘em
Kill ‘em and get ‘em every time I step up and I deliver this flow
You just don’t know, Chuck go and do that though
Pull up on the scene, I’m in SPC mode
And I rep that  and by the G code I fire the stilo

Line ‘em up, time to face it, firing squad - can’t escape it
My culture - can’t erase it, my blackism - I embrace it
I can’t fake it, I can’t let ‘em make it, I can’t let ‘em slide
Lynch my brothers, rape my sisters, no, I can’t let that ride
I got pride, I’m fired up, I’m wired, flames up in my eyes
They be killing us in the street, some are sixteen, genocide
Mr. Cap of the SPC squad, penalizing corruption
Seventy-five rifles trained on ‘em, waiting for instructions
Destruction in my wake, my spirit you can’t break
My third eye awake, we marching the earthquake
When the 50 KR break, every chain be loaded and cocked
I’ll be there when the smoke clear, watch them all drop, ‘igga

This gon’ be a slaughterhouse, yeah I can see it now
Your future in the palm of my hands, you ‘bout to die now
Ain’t no retracting your infraction, it’s a cold case
Put me in front of the judge, I got stone face
Shells in my shotgun too, plus they 
Ni**as shooting out the back of the trunk, in moving cars
You don’t want none of these problems, ni**a, I promise
You gon’ end up like the late Christopher Wallace
You can take it up with the Lord, he oughta clear it out
After I murder your flesh, I take your spirit out
K called the firing squad and I’m the serg
When B-1 get at Nard, then discharge

Air them clowns, lay ‘em down
Pioneer blazing, flaming crown
The return of the felon, aiming rounds
Devils get to running when the God’s in town
A time to kill, graze the field
The walking dead turn to talking heads
I’m the risen son from the hidden one
The forbidden gun come to end your run (good riddance)
We are splitting like the Red Sea deadly
Steadily on the grind, ancestors on my mind
After dress ‘em one time, nothing lesser than a nine
No pressure when I’m shooting off the rib ‘cause I’m snoozing
Moving for the kill for real
It’s the thrill of the kill that’ll seal the deal
Grip the grain of the heat like a steering wheel
Got your faith through Hades or The Pearly Gates, wait
No mistake who you’re listening to
It’s too late when death get to whistling through
It’s too late when your face in that firing squad
Your time is up, best believe we firing, God
Meet the lord of the perfect 
Who want war with the force of that 
Breathe the verse and the earth will crack, I tell ya
It gets no worse than that

Warning: , this how I attack this track
Murder One  leaving suckers on they back
When drama comes, I set it off, this Southside killer
When I bust a round, you’ll gyrate on like a Jackson video Thriller
I’m the wrong rasta man to be f*ckin’ with
I’m the wrong rasta man to be f*ckin’ with
I’m the wrong rasta man, you’ll have wife and kids
And I’m the right motherf*cker that won’t let ya live
Dangerous, notorious, loving every minute of it
Inflicting pain, loved ones crying, soon they get over it
It’s a dirty game, it’s a game that we all chose to play
And you hear my heater whistle, when I start to spray

 what I really wanna be
And if I’m gonna be a G with a key, break free from the scene
Get away, got away clean
With a Robitussin with a Sprite with a codeine got a ni**a on lean
Back in the days I was rocking the braid
Now these days it be rocking the fade with a piece and chain still gripping the grain
Still  but a damn thing change
 thug thing, gotta get paid
Want twenty-twos just so I’ma sling some blades
Gotta hit the lye, gotta break the  off on the spot with a Cadillac Escalade
Got a  in the back, then  back
Two Tec twenty-twos in a black backpack
Wanted countless stacks, you ni**as ‘bout to jack
Y’all punk motherf*ckers ain’t f*ck with that
Hit his ass for a knot to the fade with a cocaine rock to the fiends on the block
Got 2014 like I say I win, double up again, ni**a, f*ck the cop
Mashin’ them h*es and I smash the gas
Take two or three puffs, ni**a, dump the ash
Let a ni**a know f*ck the motherf*ckin’ po-po
South Park ni**as ain’t scared to blast

I was creeping in the streets when I got the message about some drive-away K
I grabbed my forty-five, then bust a u, and texted I was on my way
Thinking about how I’ma kill these fools
And all the things that they mama would say
When I Instagrammed they photo, put it on Facebook with his head slumped kinda this way
We retaliate, my street coulda been 
I got beef, how you motherf*ckers’ salad taste?
Plus I’m , f*ck what he had to say
Don’t reply to me, you jump fly with me
Your hood status don’t apply to me
Inside of me resides a beast
Leaving a bloody trail of emcees as far as the eye can see
With binocular vision, you will put yourself in a awkward position
Them  DBX is a top competition
Beware the Coalition but y’all did not listen
It’s not my intention if y’all to come up missing
From your home or workplace
Shouldn’t have f*cked with K-Rino in the first place
Worse case scenario, you in a hearse face up
Them  DBX ready to bust

So what I ain’t on a invite, still crash that b*tch at midnight
What’s beef? Soon as you see his ass, it’s on site
Respect is earned, not given, don’t cost nothin’ to be a real ni**a
Money don’t make you a gangsta, no matter who you surround yourself with
When adjust your presence in the room, start gaining attention
That’s when you work that motherf*cker, sh*t get interesting
You get to see who’s who and what’s what
Then go in sweating and that p*ssy start opening up

Open your eyes, ni**a, I been here since the crack years
But damn it seem like ni**as done f*ck with me ‘cause I’m too real
Expecting me to fold as a whole but it’s no real
It’s only right for me to add it up and make the sh*t clear
I’m talking to you, old b*tch-ass, no-career-ass
Ni**as think they got ahead, but they still in fear-ass
How could you look me in the eyes of man
And say you love me when the knife is in my back as I stand?
But yet I’m everything you ni**as wanna be
Everything you h*es wanna see, I meant that
And everything you ni**as try to do I do it better ‘cause I kick ass
So no more Mr. Nice, minus ain’t the life
 get ya killed, I’m firing ‘em up like it’s a drill and Rino paid the price

You about to witness some rapping and dome clapping
I’m leaving these suckers gasping, yeah I’m about that action
Too trill you can’t clone, my melanin too strong
Y’all got me up in my zone by talking on two phones
Don’t let that suit and tie fool ya, yeah I did politics
Before that, I was posted up with nicks
And CDs by bloodliner’s Nubian kush
Warrior, emperor, take the mic off the hook
I got ‘em shook, or maybe it’s the way that I floss
Paid dues in this game, it don’t matter the cost
South Park Coalition, they was the first crew
Southside representing, my ni**a, that’s what it do

Leaders don’t follow, they live to see tomorrow
When you beg, bum and borrow, it shows your words are hollow
Liars, snakes, snitches, users, moochers fall hard
They face the firing squad, oh my god
Don’t call ‘em now, it’s much too late
You didn’t change your ways so just accept your fate
SPC be the clique, we put heads to bed
I know you shook, the shadow of your soul is shaking scared
Perspiration, anxiety, today your ass gon’ learn
P*ssy is a doorknob so we all gon’ get a turn
Erotic, psychotic describes my mental system
South Park juggernaut, GT Hoodizm

Not tryna cap, but you ain’t been where I been, fool
I got more killers in my circle than the pen do
They say that orange the new black, I say no thank ya
I’m ‘bout my bread, keeping it business, the new gangsta
Stay on the grind, getting it the slow or the fast way
So many hefty bags, you might think it’s trash day
Stay strapped, ready to spray if yo ass play
So where your body fall, that’s where your body lay
Southside South Park is where we all from
Ain’t nobody saying sh*t when them laws come
Bust a snitch in the mouth and leave his jaws numb
And don’t start no sh*t ‘cause it’s gon’ be some

Son of  , I’m used to hearing them shots, boy
I’m used to seeing them cops on a ni**a ass, yes they hot boy
Better watch out for them scheming ni**as and them roaching h*e ‘cause they plotting, boy
I’ma treat none of these ratchet b*tches like classy chicks ‘cause they rotten, boy
The power to tour, collecting my dollars from crumbs
Inhaling my flowers in lumps, I came straight outta the slums
I want it all hundreds and ones and when I die, that’s for my son
My son, my son, say when I die, that’s for my son
Uh, young  raised by the streets, had to blaze flame to the beat
Dedication every time I write, I leave my blood stains on the sheets
 still f*cking up to eat, no hesitation, I ain’t got a thing
Mind gone, think I need a shrink
They watching me and can’t even blink

Blow it inside of ‘em, kill ‘em, I body ‘em
There ain’t no finding ‘em, I’m there reminding ‘em
I get your b*tch to blow me like 
I got no time for your sh*t, you ain’t hot enough
Taking a break from the bake getting cake
You ain’t gotta eat red meat to know it’s a steak
I’m so cold on the flow, my shoes turn into skates
Icy the user like me, now they hate
What’s up with these ni**as? Motherf*ck they 
Stacking your figures and  these b*tches
I’m nice on religion, but I pray to God
Pray that it keep me away from the frauds
Spin around  that’s the squad
Had to see what they made of, they so hard
And drop the sound, they done turn it into a job
We cleaning up shop, you are now unemployed

Allow me to hop on the track
Allow me to put real music on the map
Allow me to kill any beat ‘cause I won’t be defeated
I’m heated, believe it’s a fact
So now that I have your attention, I think I should mention that I am not feeling you ni**as
Instead I’ma get on a beat and continue to eat, steady proving I’m killing you ni**as
With that being said, I’m constantly getting that bread
Focused on staying ahead, no longer misled
Planning my future instead, don’t really care ‘bout the Feds
You heard what I said, I won’t be affected by negativity, instead I’ma grind
Building a empire for me and mine’s
So call it p-o-p, I hold it down

No pain, no gain
Stimulate your mind like cocaine
Better get in line like Usain
Wanna face the squad - that’s insane
I’ma get up in they mind, they ain’t stopping me
They can have a million guns aim at ‘em at me
I’ma run on the track ’til my feet bleed
They better phone home like E.T
Out of site, out of mind, I stay in the hood, I ain’t hard to find
Trump and Hillary are out of line, they finna get hit better 
I ain’t playing no games, I’m just telling the truth
Snapping they seals like I’m chasing the loot
Red rum so watch out
I’m squeeze on the trigger ’til they all out
Line ‘em up, one by one, I’ma hit ‘em with a verse, I don’t need a gun
Split wigs and pierce flesh, I’m down to get dirty but I stay fresh
Unleashing all the darkness, squad nonstop and cock it
Knowledge keeps the progress, Firing Squad in process

Six degrees of separation, we just need a separate nation
I’ma call it revolution, you can call it revelation
Spend it how you wanna spend it, plus put something funky in it
In this thing to show my naked ass and I’m a donkey with it
Coalition soldier, bruh, we’ll destroy and fold ya, bruh
The revolution won’t be televised, that’s what they told us, huh?
A million brothers stand with me, knowledge born organically
Oh say, yeah I can see how Uncle Sam don’t f*ck with me
The devil planned it all along, they want all the races gone
Smiling with them faces on, b*tch, f*ck you and that racist song
Here your twenty-one gun salute, b*tch, them twenty-one guns for you
Twenty-one guns they stop my flow and reckless tag gon’ come for you",https://genius.com/K-rino-firing-squad-lyrics

Damn, boy you should all be ashamed of yourselves, man
Well, I don’t even know what to say
I don’t even know what to say
I don’t even know what to say, hey

Well Gramma done passed away, everybody grieving
Family gathered ‘round the house but ain’t nobody leaving
People lingering around, hovering like vultures
Tryna see what they can get and what Granny left over
See this the time to show respect, but it’s clear them children not
Already up in the room, going through her jewelry box
Going through the closet, gettin’ clothes, they done shook the spot
One of them done took the ring, the other one done took the watch
Unplugging the television that you ‘bout to go and sell
Been there since she bought the house, man that TV old as hell
Sad to say her kids was trifling, it was hard, man she tried
Two of ‘em was in their 40s, still livin’ there when she died
Now they arguing ‘bout the house and the life insurance cash
In three months all of ‘em broke, won’t nobody cut the grass
Gramma woulda been ashamed to see this with their greedy asses
Still lost the house ‘cause they was too stupid to pay the taxes

Ain’t nothing but some family fools
Nothing but some family fools
Breaking all the family rules
If you guilty then you standing accused
Ain’t nothing but some family fools
Nothing but some family fools
Breaking all the family rules
If you guilty then you standing accused

Everybody was crying when Daddy laid it down
Now they all fighting and Daddy is barely in the ground
What he did for his family to make it was indisputable
But now these stupid fools is getting into it at the funeral
All that drama and stress, no wonder he dead
Plus everybody knew about that bread up under his bed
Brothers and sisters bickering, turning to enemies quick
Fussing ‘bout who helped him the most when he was struggling and sick
Roaching for everything, some people just have no chill
Now all hell is breaking loose ‘cause Daddy had no will
And Mama been gone but he had a girlfriend in his life
And now she beefing with the kids ‘cause she the common law wife
And it been years since one of the children and pops even spoke
And now he coming back trying to get some bread ‘cause he broke
And the daughter shady as hell, plus the youngest one smoke
Y’all never cared about that man, boy - this family’s a joke

Ain’t nothing but some family fools
Nothing but some family fools
Breaking all the family rules
If you guilty then you standing accused
Ain’t nothing but some family fools
Nothing but some family fools
Breaking all the family rules
If you guilty then you standing accused

Mama still alive but she doesn’t have much longer
This the time where the family’s supposed to get stronger
Come together in a crisis and handle the obstacle
And make sure that her last days are happy as possible
But instead everybody’s greed got to be fed
Y’all standing over Mama, fussing ‘bout her hospital bed
You after everything she own before her casket is closed
Tryna make her sign some papers with some tubes in her nose
She being handled in a manner that she didn’t deserve
But it’s alright because she knew it so she threw ‘em a curve
She already had a will made, already on file
The bad seeds getting jealous of the one good child
And that’s the one who she left all possessions and cash
‘Cause if the others woulda got it, they’d of tricked it off fast
Don’t wanna build like your mother did, work and achieve
So when your time finally come, you won’t have nothing to leave
You know why?

Ain’t nothing but some family fools

Til We Get It Right,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"It took a long time to get this condition
We ain’t gon’ flip it overnight

I guess the cops gon’ keep busting, wonder why we don’t trust ‘em
The savage law makers and wolves having discussions
A gun in our pocket, they lock us up once we shot it
Convicting us for dope but they’ll never say how we got it
My gangsters aggravated so bodies lay on the pavement
You hate it but you won’t admit this is what you created
And as long as we stay in the hood you ignore the damage
But soon as we come in the suburbs, it’s time to panic
My Gs out here starving, they grind, push and they scuffle
If you can’t fix his problems, how can you tell him don’t hustle?
You say these thugs ain’t got no fathers if they don’t listen
That’s mostly ‘cause your system put many of ‘em in prison
You seen him and his children and wiped him out of the photo
And broke the family up so the mama raising him solo
And it’s crazy how the cycle continues for generations
What’s even worse it won’t ever change ’til we awakened
Come on

But we gon’ keep pushing ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep working ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep trying ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep teaching ’til they see the light

In life you got to get your reps in until your weight shift
Yo Laura Ingraham, won’t you shut up and go get a facelift?
You talk about Durant and LeBron like you so good
But the question is how much money did you give to the hood?
What you donate to inner city youth? Where is your package?
I know the answer already, I’m just being sarcastic
I guess that you accomplished the mission with one mention
‘cause dissing someone greater than you gave you attention
I’m wishing I could show all my homies out here surviving
It ain’t about the shoes that you wearing or what you’re driving
It ain’t about your Instagram followers and flashing
It ain’t about the check, it’s what you do after you cash it
With what we ‘bout to be facing, there’s no time to be wasting
It’s bad math if you spending more cash than you making
Tricking off what you could have been flipping’s a stupid look
Don’t be jealous when you see people eating, learn how to cook

But we gon’ keep pushing ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep working ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep trying ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep teaching ’til they see the light

To my youngsters in the streets, y’all tripping and acting crazy
Y’all shooting at each other, not caring about these babies
Your gun gave you courage so now you around here flexing
Innocent bystanders getting caught up in yo plexin’
Terrorizing your section with no sense of direction
You reckless, you supposed to provide the hood with protection
The need to have money is in you like an infection
So now you in prison learning a fifty year lesson
And for what? Got heated and ran straight to the trunk
All because you wanted to prove you wasn’t no punk
Took somebody’s child from the world, life gone quick
Nothing wrong with fighting but you fighting for the wrong shit
I hope one day you will realize
The stuff I see us doing brings tears to my eyes
Almost every night it’s some youngster they light up with the strap
They laid the plan out, you falling right up in the trap
Now..

But we gon’ keep pushing ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep working ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep trying ’til we get it right
We gon’ keep teaching ’til they see the light",https://genius.com/K-rino-til-we-get-it-right-lyrics
Smoke,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019.0,"I pull from the waist then jug my mic through your face
I was spotted in space, challenging light to a race
When my CD drops, my fans cut right to the chase
Too hype to remove the plastic, they just bite through the case
My horrible smoke, you don’t want no part of that revoke
So beyond dope that I could give a heart attack a stroke
My house is a boat full of magic artifacts that float
My starter pack consists of a full almanac of quotes
It’s incumbent of me to cause something to bleed
I keep two hundred and three different mics under my sleeve
Some wonder indeed why I have zero number of seeds
‘Cause I’m yet to find an equally twisted woman to breed
The mic supremist, adjective and noun extremist
Me falling off just means that I would slip down to genius
Among the greatest who did it I’m listed
You wouldn’t make the top five if only you and four other rappers existed

Boy, I got that smoke, I got that smoke
You ready for ‘em to hang, then I got that rope
Bring it down, young fella, you are not that dope
Don’t make me reach my hand way back and chop that throat
Boy, I got that smoke, I got that smoke
You ready for ‘em to hang, then I got that rope
Bring it down, young fella, you are not that dope
Don’t make me reach my hand way back and chop that throat

He’s chasing me really quickly but never will he get me
Piss me off, I’ll put your child in timeout until he’s 50
On the war trail, I compose and stack more mail
Lyrical crossover so nasty the backboard fell
I’m tight clutching the mic but still subject to fight
Plus I murdered pressure right after it busted the pipe
My position’s locked in and I stand with it
I wasn’t passing you the torch, I was tryna burn your hand with it
I write words for the love that start purging for blood
If you lose, you gotta take a nap submerged in a tub
I was bad but now I think worse
I had a staring contest with a man on a picture and the picture blinked first
I don’t have to talk when I’m full of hateful aggression
I’ll cuss your whole family out with a facial expression
Snatch your life before you snatch mine
When you expire, I’ll sneak in the hospital and sign my name on your flat line

Boy, I got that smoke, I got that smoke
You ready for ‘em to hang, then I got that rope
Bring it down, young fella, you are not that dope
Don’t make me reach my hand way back and chop that throat
Boy, I got that smoke, I got that smoke
You ready for ‘em to hang, then I got that rope
Bring it down, young fella, you are not that dope
Don’t make me reach my hand way back and chop that throat

When a pen is around, my acumen drops down
Leave your head swole, big as the jack in the box clown
I’m under the understanding you're planning to reprimand me
Backhand you and knock your bloodline to a whole different family
I’m fast and cunning, so much life-force blasting from me
I took CPR and resuscitated the practice dummy
Rap armageddon, K is not the one to threaten
Started wrecking and made it so hot that the Sun was sweating
If I stay in front of your house, you’ll never come out again
My standard's so high I gave myself an one out of ten
It’s all about the win, follow me closely
If you lose, you a loser, we don’t give out no participation trophies
I wanted to get amnesia so I self-induced it
To get the feel of the first time hearing my music
Make every enemy resign with SPC on his mind
I’m so precise the clocks and watches look at me for the time

Boy, I got that smoke, I got that smoke
You ready for ‘em to hang, then I got that rope
Bring it down, young fella, you are not that dope
Don’t make me reach my hand way back and chop that throat
Boy, I got that smoke, I got that smoke
You ready for ‘em to hang, then I got that rope
Bring it down, young fella, you are not that dope
Don’t make me reach my hand way back and chop that throat",https://genius.com/K-rino-smoke-lyrics
Turn the Light Out,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"Aiyo we do this for real
Ain't no grand standing
We ain't tryna showboat
Cats who showboat leave the spot with no throat
Boss on the beat, come on

Sickest to ever do it, no ifs, buts or maybes
Came before my time like a premature baby
Passing your sight level by mashing the right pedal
They thought I had a grill but it was chewed up mic metal
I'm thresher than rain water, you ain't ready for a dose of this
Catalog longer than a fat dude's grocery list
Still I'm never changing up, your career's flaming up
Like a winter coat in mid-July, you need to hang it up
Once my enemy starts pretending he hard
I get madder than Kanye when he don't win an award
When my throat starts clearing watch them killer lyrics start appearing
Dirty labels tryna sign me like I'm hard at hearing
The known rebel, for ordinary I won't settle
I'm so clever I can't even reach my own level
Original bars, I'm sick like I'm out of meds
I heard you paying for your lines like a powder head

Turn the lights out on 'em, turn the lights out on 'em
Anybody think they rough on the mic, I want 'em
If he ever raise up and try to fight back with me
I'ma make sure they see you getting mic slapped quickly",https://genius.com/K-rino-turn-the-light-out-lyrics
Hood Rules,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"Yeah
Hood curriculum

We bust you like lead blocks, pinpoint like red dots
Start taking aim, nothing to the body only head shots
Grind hard and move weight, all work at a fixed rate
Jack a fool today then tomorrow sell him a mixtape
Our paper's roll like bowl game, the more love the more pain
Hustlers on a highway with a trunk load full of cocaine
We leave you at a standstill, hit you like an anvil
Acting like you gangster when you not can get a man killed
We hit up without knowing, every tooth in ya mouth gone
Got love for all my hood chicks from Hallistock to South Lawn
Come down with ya price man, we ain't gonna say it twice man
My hood holds the records for most cats murdered in dice games
Whether rich man or poor man, I never feared no man
My foe ran, I chased him down and trapped him with my slow hand
And every street's a fast street, thirteen year-olds blast heat
And every five or ten minutes a hater gets his ass beat

If they disrespect the hood rules knock them down fast
One thing and we don't like is people playing with our cash
If you scared to ride say that, gangsters don't play that
Wherever you pull a stunt is where ya body gonna lay at

You better get your pride up before them killers ride up
You walk inside your crib and find your whole family tied up
Them boys is on the down low, speaking with they close friends
And the average girl done messed around with more women than most men
We stack loot like Plywood from your hood to my hood
I hate to see my people broke I'd help 'em all if I could
You hungry, get your head right and then go and get your bread straight
Anybody in your clique who ain't about paper is dead weight
Snitching will get you head black, attack and blow your wig back
You parked your car at night off in the projects, shouldn'ta did that
And hustle is a chess game, better make the right move
And boys committing more crimes in the daylight than the night fool
If Plan A don't work out, I'll push it up to Plan Z
The only language I speak is money in my hand, G
And never trust nobody man the whole game is wicked
Boys selling out quick as two dollar Super Bowl tickets


I'm from the city where they glorify bullshit like codeine
Half the dudes I grew up with either sell dope or dope-fiends
But it's to fight and who got partners better bring the right ones
When it comes to cop sometimes the black ones be worse than the white ones
Had a deal to pump your bread up, they jacked you when y'all met up
The chick you was in love with was the one that had you set up
And long after you bail out, I'm staying on my mail route
And still gon' hold it down for every soldier in the jailhouse
Man these streets won't let you pass, rob you fast without a mask
Leave your ass on the side of the road like a motherfucking car that ran out of gas
Boys get on you like a rash, keep your dough and look for cash
Went to the room with a prostitute then fell asleep and she beat you and took your stash
If you keep it one hundred I'll promise it's all good fool
Whatever town you live in you better learn these hood rules
And hope you suck the knowledge up, the shife don't even try it
'Cause by the time you learn the game is too late to apply it",https://genius.com/K-rino-hood-rules-lyrics
No Let Up,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"I'm the most dangerous dude, that you ever heard on a track
Like Grits on Al Green, I threw a hot pot of words on your back
You can't guard me one on one, I lose control when you battle me
Do a lyrical crossover, and make you sprain your mentality
I cave your chest in and enslave ya, as a favor
You could be an important voice message, and I still wouldn't save ya
If a cap was peeled way back in the gap, who did it
I'm not a pimp but I'll cut one's hand off, and slap you with it
They lose because I bruise, any response they use
You ain't street, you all on the stage doing Beyonce moves
Your intellect I disconnect, till you confused in the head
You need to give your girl a microphone, and let her use it in bed
If you cap at me, gravity's coming rapidly
I couldn't see myself losing, if I was looking in a mirror rapping and battling me
The words I sung, I brung em with clout
I'll bloody your tongue, and ram a tampon in your mouth

You ain't ever heard a writer, that can bust like me
La-la-la-la-la
If you dream that I was killing you, I just might be
La-la-la-la-la
I can't let up on these cowards, so I elevate on every c.d
La-la-la-la-la
I got unlimited methods, I could murder lies of M.C
La-la-la-la-la

I hate doing second verses, after one what's left
The first one usually be so hard, I'm scared to follow myself
First thing, how could you think that you could bless the mic
You out of line like two dudes that showed up at the club, together dressed alike
You thought you had hands, and tried to fight death
Didn't throw your left right, so now all you have is your right left
And female rappers, I murder two with mad paragraphs
When I'm finished, your menstrol cycle's the only flow you gon have
Your skill ain't cutting it, so now you trying to do my flow
You got me so bored, that I'm feeling just like a 2-by-4
Can't overcome me, so you might as well follow me
I violate you like a damn baseball player, do the steroid policy
We ain't gotta trade sixteen's, I'm so far past ya
I'll let you spit a 36, I'll spit a four and still smash ya
Cutting your vocal cords, or throw your entire approach off
I'll take you out the game, like a player who pissed the coach off


I'm worse than weed, so if you on paper don't do cake
Boys flunking drug tests, with P.O.'s found traces of my word play in they U-A
The last time, people came to see you emcee
They was asking for they money back, and they had got in free
It's like this, when you spit I heard doubt
The only way that you could write hard rhymes, is if you spell both those words out
I refuse to lose, my statements bruise and hurt crews
Your words don't go together, like football socks and church shoes
You get three wishes, I'll appear and take a bum out
Ain't no lamp I'm a hood genie, you gotta rub a forty ounce bottle to make me come out
My status high, you can't reverse mine
I'll let you practice two years I'll quit for two years, still end your career with my worst rhyme
You want my spot, you been watching too much T.V
I'm like the letter A, before you can come to B you gotta C me uh
I ain't concerned, with them verses you spit
I could sit on a toilet hear you rap, and I still wouldn't give a shit",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-let-up-lyrics
Last Days,The Hit List,2004,"Welcome, this is your boy Psycho NIP, SPC
And we’re in the last days
You should be listening to K-Rino
And let me tell you why
He’s a minister of ministries and you know what goes on in the streets
So if he tell you it’s the last days,  it is the last days

God made man in his own image after his likeness
To be an earthly reflection of his righteous preciseness
He brought something out of nothing, my word is my bond
And the creation of man and the Universe corresponds
The one Sun controls the nine planets
The 1 and the 9 makes up a 19, the math is real simple once you understand it
The one brain controls the nine systems of the man’s anatomy
Connecting our anatomy to the galaxy
See what I’m saying might sound worthless so let me come back to the surface
‘cause Like the Moon my thoughts used to be where the Earth is
But I got lifted and elevated to a state
Where I could kill word giants with math and science
If you want your instance to continue beyond physical life, then you
Must become a venue for God’s spirit to live up in you
That’s when you find yourself standing
On a plane where you constantly are sinning, level after level, never landing
We in the last days

The last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the present, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prism, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prison, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
The last days, the last days

If God is with me who can be against me?
And since we sinning immensely, death is close and can’t no atheist convince me
See the time we living in is real crucial
We standing in the Valley of Decision and ain’t none of the ground neutral
You holler, “Dear Lord”, but yet you fear man when you should fear God
But remember Jesus returned packing a sword, dripping blood
So while we out he rapping ‘bout cars, the slurp, the jewellery, the weed
The world is suffering from war, hatred and greed
Huh and bomb threats got you sweating
Feeling threatened ‘cause we getting closer to the war of Armageddon
Where the canvas is damaged and burnt up from New York to Los Angeles
Glances at death for each man the scandalous evangelist
To make it all simple and plain
Farrakhan’s the man we need to listen to, no matter what religion that you claim
And the scriptures make it clear
That with war tanks around Jerusalem, the end is near, that time is here
We in the last days

The last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the present, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prism, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prison, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
The last days, the last days

Some people get confused when they’re watching the news
But the time can be recognised through the scriptures if we can decipher the clues
The last ten years went quick, notice the time acceleration
America’s the mystery Babylon spoken of in Revelation
Now me standing at the front door of the judgement, man
Where the fire was prophesized and like in the past when the floods came
And the powers of the world be promoting sin and we loving it
And the dragon mentioned in the Bible represents the government
So flashback to the Book of Genesis 15 to 13
Where God speaks to Abram about returning to the sea
And the seed would be a stranger in a land that’s not theirs
And they will serve and be afflicted for 400 years
After which time God would judge that nation and theat man
That seed was the black people and America was the land
Now we stand in the belly of the beast
Where wars in the Holy Land won’t cease and boys get raped by catholic priests
Where murders and drug use is at an increase
Disease and unusual weather patterns, no justice, no peace
North against the South, West versus the East
‘cause when the seals got broken, all Hell was released
We in the last days

The last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the present, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prism, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prison, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
The last days, the last days",https://genius.com/K-rino-last-days-lyrics

How Many Rhymes,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"The amount of dirt from the Earth vegetation grows from
The amount of ash that the mythical Phoenix rose from
The number of miles that cover each ring around Saturn
The total number of galaxies, atoms, and star patterns
Each tear newborns cry, the allergens in the sky
Atmospheric particles of matter not visible to the eye
The mysteries of life that to humans are unclear
The amount of time a man blinks his eyes in one year
Every brain cell combined in 10 geniuses minds
Every hundreth of a second that exists in a lifetime
Each crystal of beach sand
The individual strands of hair on each man
The life lines on each hand
Surgical lacerations
People with Playstations
The total amount of technological innovations
The number of each living souls dreams and aspirations
The amount of cells released in one semen ejaculation
Unjustify the rest, the hearts in the chest
Seven times the complete quantity of skin pores on the flesh
Lint on the rug, the ounces of water in a mammoth flood
However many times a forensic scientist examines blood
The amount of cash needed after a natural disaster
The amount of blades of grass in a 100th acre pasture
How many rhymes?
3 times the faces of Asia
The amount of water produced by a melting glacier
The total off every bar and every line of battle
The quantity of every drop of rain that fell in Seattle
Each moment of time, each grain of human momentum
Every book written, every page, and every word in em
The sum of the world's wonders, the total of all numbers
The complete volume of heat in a thousand combined summers
The magnitude of power of every living being's aura
The amount of brimstone that fell in Sodom and Gomorrah
The total amount of leaves on all trees
The number of faces of a daily basis that every man sees
The bricks in every building that's ever been designed
10 times the number of each rapper that ever wrote a rhyme
All the wealth of every generous man or woman can give
Seven times the amount of years that Methuselah lived
10 times the amount of marijuana in every spliff
And almost more than the amount of cocaine that Bush sniffed
The amount of info on every Internet search
Every dollar in every collection plate in every search
Inches from the ground to the peak of a rainbow's arch
Twice the amount of brother's at the Million Man March
The number of bullets ever to exert from a gun
The amount of miles of distance from the Earth to the Sun
The articles of clothing and threads in all garments
The number of snitches on a daily who talk to informants

The total of cell phone calls made in one day
Every musical note played and every song ever made
And the total amount of child support money ever paid",https://genius.com/K-rino-how-many-rhymes-lyrics
S.P.C.,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Let me tell you the story of one of the greatest rap cliques of all time
Let me tell you how it went

1987 was the year
When I first came up with the plan and idea
To round up some certified Sterling High G’s
And formulate a group of sick killer MCs
It started with me then G.T. and Preppy J
Easy T, C-Rock, DBX and Rapper K
We was murdering any local or out of town crew
And my homie DJ Screw was in the crowd too
Couldn’t tame us, nah we wasn’t rich, wasn’t famous
The clique was growing quick but what shall I name it?
Whatever it was, had to stand out, had to be good
Had to be something with South Park, that was my hood
Now it’s understood, after the name, then the respect
Way back then there wasn’t even 10 of us yet
I was slipping through a book, when it caught my attention
When I just happened to look and see the word “Coalition”
Now

Later on that same year, it's true when I say
A storm was brewing at a school 10 minutes away
Tryna rap back then was like swimming with the sharks
Jones High had the hardest MCs in South Park
Elite killers like Klondike Kat and Ganksta N-I-P
A.C. Chill, K-Rock Death and Murder One, Rip
The tension was building up, we was talking a lot of trash
It was just a matter of time before me and N-I-P clashed
Had to settle the beef, who's the better MC?
But I wasn't coming to him and he wasn't coming to me
So in school, let one day we met up half way
At the famous battleground on Bellfort and M.L.K
His soldiers and my soldiers both ready to go to war
People said that it was the sickest battle they ever saw
In the end it was a draw, both of us was spitting sick
After that the Jones rappers was now part of the clique
Called

Now we 20 deep, merking anybody we see
And Rapper K. introduced me to the homie Dope-E
A lyricist and a producer, every talent was strong
Had equipment at his house so we started creating songs
And Deuce Twice, Egypt-E was his other 2 troops
So my 1989 I was a part of the group
K.O. was singing hooks, now we deep in our ranks
And it was over once we brought in Grimm and Point Blank
PSK, Ruff Eyque, Tech and X-Man
Greek, Rhyme Felon, Street Military and Killa Klan
Brain Dead, Mr. Cap, Shadow Mob all day
Justice Allah, K-Water and my sister Cl'che
Can't forget my brother Big Sniper and the 2G
Wolf Town in the UK, affiliates overseas
200 albums and millions of records sold combined
30 years, first clique in the South still on the grind
Who?

Wanna shoutout to the whole South Park Coalition
I can't name all of y'all but y'all know it's love
Y'all did this, we started this up man
Shoutout to the homie 20 to Life
My boy Father Time
What up Chucky? I see ya",https://genius.com/K-rino-spc-lyrics
Everlasting Life,No Mercy,1999.0,"Everlasting life from womb of a black woman
Show respect every time that you see that sister coming
Everlasting life from womb of a black woman
Show respect every time that you see that sister coming

Don't you forget, where you came from
She brought you in the world, fed you, led you onto the right road, she the same one
That put up with you through the whole picture
The one that hid you in the closet when them fool's came to get you
Day by day, struggling hard with this world, going at it
Tryna fix it so her son can have it better than she had it
Nine months on the inside, the realm of protection
End result, birth establishing the eternal connection
He can kill a hundred men, be in the pen or hold the ___
Lose his friends, all his ends and mama still gon' come and see him
She might hug you, she might just cuss you out and make you melt
Real love is when she bust you with that belt
Black Goddess, giver of life, but if you buck her she gon' cut ya
But you'll still be quick to murder anybody if they touch your mother
All civilization, infinite power they summon
Every great man that ever lived came up out a woman
You got...

Everlasting life
The life that she give you
And the love unconditionally
(You got)
Everlasting life
The life that she give you
And the love that is unconditionally
Cause ain't nobody down for ya like your mama is

Girl, you been there from the dirt but I took you for granted
Why you ain't left me a long time ago, I can't understand it
See I done lied, you done cried, but you swallowed your pride
Even at times she caught me cheating, she was hurt, but she let it slide
Know all my business, but you know she ain't telling
Struggle with me if I'm stressing, why my album ain't selling
No reversing real lady, never once heard her curse
Mentally our thoughts connect, like we was the same person
Straight saying she'll be with me, if them fools ever bust me
Her brother fouled up when he see me and her daddy don't trust me
I should of known that, done broke up two or three times and gone back
No matter where we roam at, we both know where home at
Yo, she down with me, never tryna be fast
And thread the reaches out her purse and straight give me her last
If I pop up on the late night, I ain't gotta run game
No questions asked, she just happy that I came
Understand you got...

Everlasting life
The life that she give you
And the love that's unconditionally
(Know that you got)
Everlasting life
The life that she give you
And the love that's unconditionally
Tell me that you loving, loving life

Call a lady out her name like it ain't no big deal
But let 'em disrespect your mama, you be ready to kill
Y'all don't always see eye to eye and nah she ain't perfect
But she give a cause for given you your life so it worth it
If your beating on your black queen, that's promise for the kill
If you run out while she's pregnant you's a sucker for real
If you sell some crack to her, you gon' die real slow
You gon' suffer if you take her while she telling you no
See tears of pain during labor, while she pushing you loose
But tears of joy after witnessing the life she produced
And then you put your hands on the one that bring forth life
If you so hard, slap the police like you slap on your wife
Cause you got...

Everlasting life
The life that she give you
And the love unconditionally
(unconditional love, unconditional love)
You got

The life that she give you
And the love that is unconditionally

Three Weeks Later,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019.0,"Guess sometimes you just… gotta try to move on, man, ya know?
It was only three weeks later
It was only three weeks later
I was at the park, just doing my thing
I was on the slide, she was on the swing
Looking at the squirrels, playing by the bush
She was slowing down, I gave her a push
We started to talk, we started to laugh
Took her on a date, I brought her to the lab
Conversation good, her body had me shook
She told me she sings, I put her on a hook
Man, if we were young, I would take her to the prom
It was getting deep, I let her meet my mom
I let her meet my dad, I let her meet my dog
Hanging every single day, man, we did it all
Just two people living life, going everywhere
My homeboys teasing but I didn't care
We were free, we were happy, no drama, no fussin’
Lovin' the vibe and real spiritual discussions
Can't explain her ways with any one phrase
Feels like a year, it’s only been twenty-one days
Anytime I needed her around, she would come
I'm laying in my bed, thinking she could be the one, I'm
Spending all my time with this new lady I knew
We might run away together, have a baby or two
I was just about to run my fingers right through her hair
And then I…
Hold up, wait
Is that my bike over there?
I took off running and left the lady still sitting down
Thinking this is my only shot of my bike gettin' found
The individual who had it was right across the street, parked at a food truck about to get something to eat and I'm like ‘heck no'
Time to make him give me my respect, bro
And if he flex, I'ma switch him over to the necro
All this time, I've been upset, catching the metro
So this is one of those situations I couldn’t let go
The guy saw me and it scared him half to death
Didn’t even take the food that he had ordered, he just left
Obviously couldn't catch him so I stood, looking silly
As he rolled off, laughing at me, poppin’ a wheelie
Like ‘Wow, what do I do now?' I guess it seems
That I'm gonna have to reacquire it through other means
And oh yeah, it's another point that should be brought to light
There’s a couple things that I didn't tell you ‘bout this bike
It was souped up secretly in a lab beneath us
Equipped with newly installed technological features
The 's complete with a forcefield around the chair
Three hundred miles an hour max speed, ground to air
The tires couldn't be penetrated with spikes or razors
The handlebars converted to weapons that shot lasers
An impressive lethal specimen disguised as a relic
And it used nitrocellulose rocket fuel to propel it
I wondered if he knew what this bike was capable of
At that moment, I saw him again, hovering above
Yeah he knows, but how could he have ever figured that?
Never mind, all I wanna do right now is get it back
Started searching, covering little ground ‘cause I was walking
Everywhere I went I saw all the havoc that he was causing
Destroying property, robbin', terrorizing the people
Using his super bike for the emphasizing of evil
So now, it's time to resort to a different method
To send a message that his efforts would be intercepted
His step was smooth, this machine was incomparable
But he never knew about the duplicates, see there were two
When the first one was built, the manufacturer hastened
To make a second version of it just for this occasion
In the event that it's stolen after I receive it
The second one would be activated to go and retrieve it
I traveled to the underground cave, knowin' it's risky
The builder of the bike was at least a hundred and sixty
The crazy part is that he still looked healthy and young
He pulled a sword on me and shouted, “What have you done?
Fool, you were the only person who knew what was possessed in this
So letting it get taken was stupid, reckless and negligent”
I said, “Yes I been wrestling ever since questioning whether to step again into your presence and tell you, Your Excellenc-y”
But to him, none of this was a secret though
He already knew that this had happened three weeks ago
After scolding me for eight hours, covering facts
He gave me the second bike and said, “Bring the other one back”
I said, “Yes sir, but first can we get something established?”
He just mushed my face and said not to return until you have it
The instructions were enclosed in a pill that gave clarity
Soon as you swallow it, you'll know its functions automatically
The cave's ceiling he didn't remove it
The advanced jet propulsion unit rocketed me straight through it
An astrophysics mechanism in its power source carried me straight to it through a magnetic force
In the original model, a chip case was placed
So in minutes, me and the criminal stood face to face
The war started, instantly missiles flying around
We were in the sky, thousands of feet above the ground
He flew behind a cloud, barely escaping my gamma
I saw his image form on a thermographic camera
A stealth device on my bike was 
He pressed a button on his handlebars, releasing a net
He started to pull me in with a ray but I  it
My bike generated heat elements and dissolved it
I calculated and planned a strategy then looked around
Deactivated his antigravity then took him down
He deactivated mine at the same time maybe
But a parachute released and I floated down safely
Unfortunately for him, he died on impact but
Magically, although the bike crashed, it was intact, in fact
I got a chance to look at his face some more
And discovered it wasn't even the guy from the store
‘cause he walked up explaining that there had been a deception
Told me the guy had taken the bike soon as I left him
And kept him in a state of non-cognitive cerebrum
Once I beat him, the spell broke and automatically freed him
Now staring at the face of the one who tried to deceive me
If I tell you who it was, you wouldn't even believe me
But I know what you're thinking, but nah, it ain't him, or is it?",https://genius.com/K-rino-three-weeks-later-lyrics
One On One,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"Yeah
Look around you boy
All your homies are gone
Yeah they was standing right there but they gone
I don't know what happen to em
Ha, ha, one minute they was standing there the next minute they were gone
There was about two hundred of em
So now it's just me and you
One on one

Let's have a one on one contest in front of the masses
To see who can snatch whose spirit from the body the fastest
Rhymes miraculously put off unbelievable stunts
Like a bullet that hits eleven parts in your body at once
I give you hell with unmatchable skills that I pervell with
Infect ya brain cells with an idiopathic element
Words orbit the earth causing our position to forfeit
Rappers commit suicide for my conscience by jumping off it
Appalled by these frauds who be breaking through the cored
Mighty weapons I show to y'all aim and unloaded em all
Y'all not hearing me con-clearly be the theory of conspiracy
You like a transvestite, you ain't what'chu appear to be
Lyrically athletic, I jump with a beat's put
A millipede with human legs to the Jordan on each foot
Less spark come in my mind, you won't make it too far
You get lost like anorexic titties in a double D bra

I can release ten-thousand folks for every line spoke
With a slammer that blaze horizontally large in my throat
In a savage bout you drop when we lyrically jab it out
The backwards magician who pulls a head out of a rabbit's mouth
I stay in motion when I pause, stop perfection in my laws
I bit down hard, and lock the hemisphere inside my jaws
My dilating bars are impossible to copy
One verbal drop of me can over fertilize the whole hobby
Ya skill was money mine would be the same as Bill Gate's
Yours would be equalled to the wages of a waitress
The true condition only the doctor and nurse knows
Ya greatest work would make the bottom of the list of my worse flows
I'd greased you with a speech till I leave my brand on
And defeat you like I cut off them thangs you stand on
So your fifty-thousand miles in the air one hand strong
Snatch the earth from under you, so it's nothing to land on

You might as well oblige, by the time you apologize
My guys be on your insides already fully canonized
I considered it a crime to try to confront in mind
I got more killer lines than a jail cafeteria at lunch time
Hope that rhyme you set against me wasn't supposed to offend
Your career is like the letter M real close to the N (yeah)
You approach me just stop bragging broaching and win
Until I spit a tighter way to write off most of your kin
I find pages ripped out of my folder for cover to cover (what's up)
My old rhymes and my new rhymes keep battling each other
I put the planet on pause when I wanna conserve energy
Cosmic enteritis listening to me on bending knee inventively
Won't wait to kill ya offspring after you breathe
I'll cut to the chase and abort your ability to conceive
Me being less than the greatest you don't truthfully believe
Sentence you to never breathe and no reprieve will be received",https://genius.com/K-rino-one-on-one-lyrics
Creator of Life,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Acknowledge the Creator
Allah the communicator, original stater
Of the word, verbally with an eternal speech
Breather of life into every and each
Make into then break into the South Park attitude
If a brother helps another, I react to his gratitude
As for the Father, He saw the act and recorded the deed
So if you're ever in need, you get rewarded
Some take the time to commit the crime
But after the crime you submit the time
That's what you think, cause you'll get it
No not acquitted, convicted cause you did it
And that which is done that is devilish as downcast
An automatic method to make you lose ground fast
Praise His name and hold up the light
The positive glow He ignites to shine bright
Cause He is the Creator


Each physical element of every man in every land
Was derived from His powerful hand
The construction of the Universe
Dating from the first man to the moment of this lyrical outburst
From every concept derived from my brain
I maintain the fact that I verbally train
Gained the strength from my years on the Earth
Some of it learned, some of it implanted at birth
Everybody's all on the neighborhood game
It's all the same parts of one city with different names
Caught in the South Park, hard fought Third Ward
Fifth Ward dist', it don't matter who's the hardest
If you support your hood, it's cool
Do it with pride but dissing others is the reason so many have died
But K-Rino will ignite every branch
Increasing the chance of a H-Town avalanche
Me and the Creator


I got to make myself do work in His name
Never in life perpetrate my game
Too many try to front and fake they quote
I'm trying my best not to miss the boat
I'm kind of confused, it's time to choose
How can I win this race if I'm running in the Devil's shoes?
I ain't a gangster or a pimp
But negativity however is hard to exempt
Yo, I gotta make my brain strong
Live my life right that I might live long
I need to know the material things mildew and mold
Cars get old, brothers die over gold
Clothes don't make the man, man makes the clothes
Allah makes the man, in a circle time goes
Time to realise that alone I'm defenseless
To live without Him is senseless

Point Number 12,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"Shout out to the God
The wise scientist convened
And decided that it was time for the new God to come up on the scene
The book said he come from the east
To seek and save the lost sheep, crush Satan and bring universal peace
Born in the holy land, known as the great son of man
Now it's time to make the planet understand
His name was Farad Mohammed
And the council of the twenty-four scientist his father came from it
He came through to put in work
His purpose was planned out by his father years before his birth
He instantly took him under his wing
Travelled around reading the great books of wisdom from the king
His existence divinely inspired
And even as a child saw himself pushing the wicked in the fire
Studying and reading, becoming the all-seeing
Eventually reaching the level of supreme being
Some people are disagreeing and leaning to the devil's way of thinking and believing, not understanding the meaning
He saw the universe and he scanned it as he mastered the atmosphere, weighed the water and measured the planets
Calculated the distance between them and made atoms spilt in which planets in the galaxy were inhabited
Measured how many miles the universe spans
Knew the history of every people and who's the first man
Every race, every nation, every tribe
Forty-two years of study makes him more than qualified to preside
To unlearn minds is kinda hard
How a man born in eighteen seventy-seven can be the God
The physical form always change
And from the beginning in many vessels that essence was contained
The energy and power remain
But the God of today and him that created the earth ain't the same
God said he was coming this time
So to move among the people his make-up had to specially designed
The black man was last in line
Fresh out of slavery yet still confined to the white supremacist mind
Self-hate no self-love
So in nineteen-thirty he came to Detroit to teach us who he was
A buzz sparked up from his activity, made us react vividly
Teaching on black liberty, gave us exact history
Atoms where cracked instantly, we are descendants of the creator, the facsimile
Satan attacked wickedly, casted his whack trickery
But Farad has showed Elijah where we was at scripturally
And was beyond this, and what was to come next
He put the words of the bible in today's context
Destruction of America, the wiles that work above them
Aircrafts you call UFOs and the purpose of them
And who the real devil is
Where hell and where heaven is
The identity of the lamb breaking the seven seals
Right through the revelation, notice this is not a game
Mater atomic creation, that's how he got his name

All I Keep Thinkin’ Bout,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you the type of girl
You that type of girl
You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you that type of girl
You that type of girl

All I keep thinking ‘bout is how you always run to me
Conversation constantly, loving each other’s company
You promised me nothing but understanding and honesty
There’s no anomaly that you’re the only one I wanna see
Never thought I’d meet the type of female in my life, man
Who would have my back and always say and do the right things
Supporting my dreams, even get my jokes and all that
You know when to come at me, you know when to fall back
Hit you on the phone and don't catch you, I know you'll call back
Even catered to me when I'm acting like a spoiled brat
Like minds attract, I need a compatible person
It feels good to have a chick who don't bother me when I'm working
And it's on whenever I come home and
Get hit by that aroma coming out the kitchen strong then
She feed me like a king, fix me up and leave me served
Knowing once I wind down after that, the night is hers

You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you the type of girl
You that type of girl
You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you that type of girl
You that type of girl

Let me get this straight, you wanna watch the game with me?
Never change around your friends, always act the same with me
If I’m rich or if I’m broke, I know she gon’ remain with me
If I ever robbed a bank, she’ll probably take the blame with me
But for real, it’s crazy after all of this time
I finally got that perfect girl I used to see in my mind
After years I started feeling like you was a myth
On some Easter Bunny shh, as if you didn’t exist
You understand how to let me play my role as a man
When I don’t think that I can do it, you let me know that I can
To get the happiness I got, most dudes would beg for the chance
And you don’t never ever try to stick to your leg in my pants
You never wear them tight outfits where you’re mostly exposed
No short skirts, you always got on some appropriate clothes
Don’t have to tell ‘em you respect me ‘cause you show ‘em you do
A hundred people in the room, I don’t see no one but you
You see…

You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you the type of girl
You that type of girl
You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you that type of girl
You that type of girl

No accusations when I’m out all night, tryna record
See I could talk to you for hours and I would never get bored
Thanking the Lord, you so silly and you always making a brother laugh
This is what they mean when they call their woman their other half
Let me run your bubble bath, wash your back, rub your calf
Never thought I’d see myself walking that happy couple path
Unlike the past ones, I’m feeling you deeply
It’s like you somehow magically know how to treat me
If it’s gon’ be like this forever then my days will be bright
I wanna shake your mom and daddy’s hand for raising you right
So now I’m telling all my homeboys that she might be the one
I gotta make sure I ain’t the fool who mess it up being dumb
I’m glad to chill any place my lady be at
Waking up next to my best friend, how crazy is that?
The things I heard the old people say, finally had meaning
Then I woke up, looked to my side and she was gone, I was dreaming
Damn

You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick
Take no shit, you the type of girl
You that type of girl
You that type of girl, no hype and super bad chick
Damn real afro but black queen, super thick

Hold On,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Say, get on up.. Get up
Come on.. We got work to do
Come on, get up

She brought a baby in this world, nobody to help her
The dude that went half on it with her straight left her
Her heart wasn't broken cause she really didn't want him
And even contemplated filing child support on him
But instead she was like, ""Nah, it's cool let him leave
I'ma make sure that my baby got everything he need""
New clothes, new toys, plenty love, yeah she did it
And she ain't need the Government, no welfare to get it
Got a job, didn't pay her much, still she was on it
Waiting for the bus at 6:30 in the morning
She was tired everyday, still focused on the grind
But every now and then she didn't make it on time
Came home, had to take care and feed him, barely sleeping
Hustling every week tryna get people to keep him
Then they called her in the office, ""We gotta' let you go""
She was 'bout to break down but I'm hear to let you know

(You gotta.. hold.. hold on.. hold on)
When life is heavy and them pitfalls hit you
And it's feeling like it ain't nobody on your team with ya
(You'll be all.. alright.. alright..)
Pull your inner strength out and bring the problem to an end
You gotta deal with what it is instead of what it could've been

Now she back to square one, but not looking for a hand out
A child she gotta feed and her money just ran out
Still had ambition, despite her condition
Some shady cats hit her with some crazy propositions
And normally she'd pay no attention or even listen
But the bread was fast, plus it was good, so it was tempting
But every time she saw her child it rapidly passed
Thoughts of that embarrassment brought back reality fast
And as for the few little crumbs that she had stashed
A couple days at the most that barely would last
Never knew her dad, he living but dead in her eyes
And beef with Momma eventually made 'em break ties
Haven't spoke to her in months, now she's really all alone
Pressure building up, rent due, money all gone
No friends she can lean on, struggling everyday
Now it's looking like that night life might be her only way

(You gotta.. hold.. hold on.. hold on)
When life is heavy and them pitfalls hit you
And it's feeling like it ain't nobody on your team with ya
(You'll be all.. alright.. alright..)
Pull your inner strength out and bring the problem to an end
You gotta deal with what it is instead of what it could've been

Now she on her last leg, done ran out of options
Contemplating putting her baby up for adoption
Crying every night, whole world out of order
With no man and no family members to support her
Now she's sitting on the bed, baby in her arms rocking
Tryna keep it quiet while the rent man was knocking
He was looking for his money, it was over and she knew it
And what she had to do to stay, she didn't want to do it
So she looked at a photograph, reached out to grab it
Cried as she carried it to the medicine cabinet
Stared in the mirror, opened up the pill bottle
And once she swallows all of them, darkness will follow
And right before she gave up the pain was uncovered
The picture that she held in her hand was her mother
Then the phone rang, a familiar voice said I saw you
Last night in a dream my daughter you need me so where are you?

(You gotta.. hold.. hold on.. hold on)
When life is heavy and them pitfalls hit you
And it's feeling like it ain't nobody on your team with ya
(You'll be all.. alright.. alright..)
Pull your inner strength out and bring the problem to an end
You gotta deal with what it is instead of what it could've been

Hold on, hold on
You'll beeeeeeee, alright.. alright..
See some brighter days (x3)
You just gotta' hold on.. hold on",https://genius.com/K-rino-hold-on-lyrics
Tired,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"I'm chilling at the crib, kicking back and feeling lazy
My girl was in the living room, my phone was ringing crazy
It rang a couple of more times, the animosity grew
(Why don't you go answer your phone) Girl I ain't tripping I'm with you
(Hell naw what you got to hide) What girl I'm grown
I ain't hiding nothing, damn I should of unplugged that phone
As I head towards the room, I get a uncomfortable notion
I know that this a female, I'm moving in slow motion
Man I hope this Greek or Murder One, 'cause drama I don't want it
I got a 1932 phone, with no caller I.D. on it
Ain't no sneaking to unplug it, she gon go off if she find me
When I walked over to answer it, she just stood there right behind me
Hello (Hey baby) Ay ay ay what's up homie
(I was hoping I could see you, I was feeling kinda lonely)
That's what's up dog (Dog why you talking to me like that)
Ah it ain't nothing, ay I tell you what man I'm-I'ma call you right back

I'm so tired of lying and chasing temptation
Creating fabrications just to fix a situation
I tell one lie and keep a standby partner I could call up
A second lie to cover the first one up and a third to clean 'em all up

Now when I hung up, my girl gave me a real funny look
She didn't notice that I put the phone, halfway back on the hook
I asked her for a glass of juice, thinking that was a close call
When she walked into the kitchen, I snatched the cord out of the wall
She came back with the juice, we just laid across the bed
She was quiet, but I could sense she had suspicions in her head
I cleaned it up, did what I had to do to suit her
I knocked her down she fell asleep, I jumped on the computer
It's one o'clock A.M., I'm tired about to turn it in bro
I see some bright car lights shine through my living room window
What the hell? I peeped outside, I'm bout to get chopped up
The girl who called me earlier, done messed around and popped up
Before she knock I slip outside to keep from getting busted
I gotta maker her move around, ain't no time to discuss it
She asking why she can't come in, how come I'm blocking the door off
I could see it in her face, she getting loud and ready to go off
It's bad enough she popped up, and I really wanna check her
Told her my grandma was her from out of town, and I ain't wanna disrespect her
My girl woke up and came outside, when she heard the voices echo
Next thing you know I'm in my draws, cussing out Joey Grecko


I'm face to face with two women, I been smashing and kissing
There's a logical explanation for all of this, if y'all would listen
One was ready to fight, the other was ready to start capping
But in a unexpected twist something very strange happened
They started talking, the plex turned off
The one that popped up, went to her car hopped in and burnt off
My girl went back to bed like everything was alright
But I ain't go to sleep for one second, I stayed up all night
I'm knowing, they got something up they sleeve
Next morning when she woke up, I couldn't wait for her to leave
I acted like I had somewhere to go and drove off separate
Then followed her to IHOP, where she met old girl for breakfast
I wished that I could hear what they was saying, but I wasn't able
Next thing you know two dudes came in and sat down at the table
I know both of these fools, now they plan done been uncovered
They done cut me loose and introduced they brothers to each other
That's cool yeah they got me, I was wrong and I can't condone that
I got more little mamas I could call but hold up man where my phone at
She had switched my phone with hers, knowing I would try to watch her
Looked right at me held my phone up, sent a text message saying ""Got ya""",https://genius.com/K-rino-tired-lyrics
Goin’ To Da Clinic,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Yo, K-Rino finna kick that low-down shit, off this static-ass track. Some of y'all listenin' to this song right now burnt and won't do shit about it. So it's up to me to drop that ice cream and milk on y'all stupid ass. Cause y'all won't do it. Well South Park has to go to the clinic

My mind is in the gutter, rolling down Calhoun
Me and Murder One finna pick up a gal soon
I shouldn't fuck with these dope fiend prostitutes
But at 3 in the morning they be kind of cute
So we picked one up by the 
Snatched the little chickenhead up and then drove straight
The whole ride was just swallows, hollers
Hit it so good, heiffer gave me five dollars
Realized I shouldn't move so fast
Cause she played Burger King and flame broiled my ass
Went to the bathroom, I must be dreaming this
Hand grenade, butcher knife, hot grease steaming piss
The girl looked good when I done it
Saw the freak the next day and I almost vomit
My meat is hot and I ain't smiling
Stick my dick in a bun you could sell it at Coney Island

So now I got to go to the clinic
I got to go to the clinic
I got to go to the clinic
And get my dang-a-lang fixed

My next door neighbour done growed up
The thighs, the headlights, the booty done blowed up
She can't never have a steady man
Because she hotter than the barbecue sauce at Timmy Chan
And you the one that gotta feel silly
Cause you stuck your cracker in the wrong bowl of chilli
She can get robbed and wouldn't care
Cause if they say, ""Stick 'em up!"", she'll put her legs in the air
Tryna hideout and keep to yourself, being low-key
Tryna diss me, I bet you won't go pee
Check the toilet for a minute
Piss was hot enough to fry five skillets of chicken in it
Not getting cured is a drastic act
You'll be walking 'round the hood with your shit in a plastic sack
Be careful when you D her
I heard the crabs on her cat even caught gonorrhoea

So now you to go to the clinic
You got to go to the clinic
You got to go to the clinic
And get your dang-a-lang fixed

Once met a freak who could burn like gas
She could give you gonorrhoea just by hugging your ass
Goes to the clinic once a month like a career
Been burnt so many times her penicillin said, ""You again?""
Last time she went they made her get out
Doctor got mad and quit and said, ""You figure this shit out""
""I keep rubber, she can't burn through those""
Cos, you better bring about twelve of them hoes
Because yo, she ain't got no self-respect
Everybody ought to keep their health in check
Because the Big A will fold your ass
And I'll be at the graveyard saying, ""I told your ass""

That uh you should have went to the clinic
You should have went to the clinic
You should have went to the clinic
And got your dang-a-lang fixed",https://genius.com/K-rino-goin-to-da-clinic-lyrics

You get swung on like baseballs or trees in the jungle
We lie we steal, smoke weed we rob we kill
Put diamonds in our grill, and pop X pills
Have sex for scrill, move weight for big faced bills

We pushing cocaine with no containment

If somebody saying they do, that mean they probably don't
And a clean ride, will get you any gal that you want

It's enough liquor on the ground, to get the cement drunk

And boys is dropping mo' underground tapes, than Bin Laden
And down the street, it's a dude that's grinding
With a trunk full of work, and the laws is behind him
And cats blaze, see his T smoke hays
Half the females either dyking, or they go both ways
And everybody, want drugs and sex
Some got new cars, and living in the damn projects
(on my side), you better learn to fight
Bullets burn and bite, it might be your turn tonight
If it's plex between me and you, might witness division
It's competition in the G-code, it's like a religion
We buy and sell, the females are fine as hell
And on the cool, half of them done did time in jail

Kill ’Em,K-Rino,1998,"K-Rino advance, trap a sabre
He pimped my verses so intense he sucked a passion mark on the paper
No one is parallel in power the precise rhymer
Multiple mind master mathematical mountain climber
I penetrate the concrete with laser beams
Extreme punish your team, I’m walking in letting the razor swing
Shots I’m never missing, know you’re hating when you’re dissing
Explicit displays, audience be suffocating when they listen
Twenty foot beeper, ancient spirit secret keeper
Nobody deeper, Grim Reaper died and murdered verses on your paper
Managed to duck my left hook but it gnawed your strength
Able to strangle a rapper with a cordless mic
It’s agony, doses in panic, accepting psychiatrists
Nagging me, diagnosis manic depressive poisonous
Mental medicine is fatal ________ I boast
So lethal is my style that it can kill a ghost


Dangerous, dominant, death and mental death blows are what I’m giving
Wicked coroner performing autopsies on the living
I’m driving my diabolical forces so come and get ‘em
Had him so scared the perpetrator blurred before I hit him
Got with him, K for kicking, all for rhymes wise
Intellectual flow, can I lose? Last two letters, NO
Poetic sorcerer, each line is a gram
I wrote my hardest lyrics sleeping with a cast on my hand
Warp speed traveller, you realise rapidly ain’t no stopping me
I need to watch my back, now I’m so sick my back be watching me
You wish you had what you see is K scientist
Conducting lab experiments to duplicate my DNA
Phonetic expert teacher of mind power
Overload two hundred thousand rhymes I memorise an hour
Narrate ____ been sharp enough to cut a knife
Probably said this rhyme a year ago although I wrote it in another life


Coast to coast, unconscious listeners, eyes closed, I still read ya
Thought wave alterations through microsurgical procedures
Some analyse my style by rewinding me
Multiple personalities spitted at once, all of a sudden there’s nine of me
I’ma tryna be vocally superior but it’s blinding me
Webster’s Dictionary has three thousand pages defining me
Resurrect brains, initiate stinging physical pain
Fire rain third degree acidic and visible flame
My foe must go, mental crucifixion, they die from slow
Hard karate blow, label my style Taekwondo
Lyrically, many consider me full of energy
I’m running through at least 22 infinities mentally
Miscellaneous styles universally gain approval
Coalition scientist specialise in brain removal
Defying laws of physics, heavily trained rhymes
Able to move at light speed and slow motion at the same time",https://genius.com/K-rino-kill-em-lyrics
The Cleansing Room,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Listen. it all started on a rainy night around noon
I woke up and found myself trapped in a locked and sound room
First I thought that I was there alone but didn't anymore
'Cause I noticed 5 other people sitting on the floor
I was confused and scared, anxiety in my head
'Cause I knew the night before I was lying sleep in my bed
So the question was how did I arrive tell me quickly
And more importantly who were the other 5 dwelling with me
Their real identities I would come to discover each
One man was a doctor, the other one was a priest
A politician, teacher and a cop were the other three
But the room now consisted of six because of me
We were all nervous what was the purpose of this endeavor
None of us had ever met yet we were all here together
We were yelling loud, banging on the wall tryna crush it
Then a voice over the intercom strongly interrupted

You are in the cleansing room
You are in the cleansing room
There will be a cleansing soon
Leading to impending doom
You are in the cleansing room
You are in the cleansing room
There will be a cleansing soon
Leading to impending doom

We all jumped in horror because his tone was horrid
And with authority he told the doctor to come forward
He said do you know why you are here? And he replied
That he didn't, so the voice began to ruthlessly describe
All the times that his patients were told intentional lies
And guided to the grave with medicines he prescribed
You've ended many lives people died prematurely
'Cause love of money drove you to practice your craft poorly
Then he called out the teacher, told her everywhere that you went
You knowingly would teach false history to your students
You stayed silent as every moral fiber decayed
Afraid to challenge power, just content with being paid
Mr politician your evil ways have never switched
Oppressive policies made for the benefit of the rich
And he spoke to the cop who just had to be stopped
For the racial hate harassment and black people he shot

You are in the cleansing room
You are in the cleansing room
There will be a cleansing soon
Leading to impending doom
You are in the cleansing room
You are in the cleansing room
There will be a cleansing soon
Leading to impending doom

There was deep regret, the voice told the priest he's next
He said, ""You prey on little boys like a beast for sex
You're supposed to lead them to God 'til each is blessed
But you destroyed lives and left and increased defect""
The stage was set, who was this voracious threat
But what was crazy he hadn't even engaged me yet
The rest were crying with fear, the defiance was clear
Nervously I said, ""Excuse me sir, but am I here""
He said, ""You make songs that potentially can influence
You can bring the people to truth or you can bring them to ruins
The decision is up to you, what will you do with your voice
I hope that what you witnessed here will help you render your choice""
That's when the doctor started throwing up his body declined
The teacher's mental state diminished, she started losing her mind
A bullet shot through the wall I was frozen with shock
It went right through the politician's head and murdered the cop
He gurgled and dropped, from the top a flame was released
And I don't even want to speak on what became of the priest
Right then I knew I couldn't misuse my gifts in these streets
The door opened the voice said, ""Yes, you get it now, go in peace""

You are in the cleansing room
You are in the cleansing room
There will be a cleansing soon
Leading to impending doom
You are in the cleansing room
You are in the cleansing room
There will be a cleansing soon
Leading to impending doom",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-cleansing-room-lyrics
The Day of the Storm Intro,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Look outside, Understand
This is the time that you been hearing about all your life
The time where the Old World is destroyed
And the New World is ushered in
Not the New World Order or God's kingdom
No more slave makers
Mo more oil thirsty governments
No more world bankers
No more biological and chemical warmongers living among us
The storm is coming, It's 'the Day of the Storm'
Look outside
Question:
Can your weapons stop a hurricane?
Can your bombs stop an earthquake?
'The Day of the Storm'
Watch It

Judgement from the omnipotent One
Master Fard Muhammad was predicted to come
Crafts in the sky, everybody seeing the lights
Storms executed by the MagD and the Christ
Despite the signs, Shaitan extended his crimes
Will you fall with the Devil at the end of his time?
This is it U.S.A. now suffering plagues
Last days better line yourself up with it's ways
Time to pull the cover off of His invisible plan
Heavy injustice carried on the original man
Still we trying to ascend and climb the divine rope
America hates blacks and Muslims and I'm both
They wiping out civilizations
Truth is, America's the real terrorist nation
While the dirty slave master stays thundering mad
You better make sure your good deeds outnumber your bad, uruh",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-day-of-the-storm-intro-lyrics
Talkin’ Loud,Time Traveler,2006,"I ain't no gangster, but on the mic I make boys bail
They run up in my set tripping, I check 'em like voicemail
Records dropping no promotion, but they manage to sell
My folks want 'em worse, than boys want naked pictures in jail
I leave you swoll up in a corner, with a ice bag on ya
You so brand new, you still got the price tag on ya
You wanna be me, the flow murdering three deep sprayer
It'll never work, like putting a 8 track in a c.d. player
I don't bar these Hollywood cats, it's all about me
You can't see me, like a blocked number on a caller I.D
You got a entourage, trust me you could still get smacked
On songs bragging bout pistols, that your homeboys pack
I'm frustrated and I'm broke, but I'm keeping the faith
I wrote my own name on a list, of the people I hate
And I don't rehabilitate devils, I kill 'em and skate
I ain't gon waste my time, trying to make a snake fall straight

You must not know, who I am mayn
(I can see it, when I look in your eyes)
Talking loud, but you ain't saying a damn thang
(up in the neighborhood, telling them lies)
When I'm through, you gon remember my damn name
(when I heard the shit, I wasn't surprised)
In my hood, we get it popping like champagne
(You fools, bout to make my temperature rise yeah)

So many niggas wolf about they boxing game, but then get knocked out
And be the first one back to the car, before the gunman could squeeze some shots out
Why they always mean mugging, looking like they gon bring some drama
Hoping the shit hit the fan they run to mama, and the tears smear they eye liner
With they cute ass, but not me I'm quick to knock niggas out and shoot fast
Garunteed to knock out socks when I handle the rock, and give a nigga hoop flash
And if you ain't one deep, fuck around and put hands on your whole group ass
Then see how many weak rhymes, your ass can get bruised up and toothless
I'll do this to a nigga, I'll do this to a bitch
Long as it's done on pen and paper, to help the person that's saying he get rich
But in real life I caught cases, for stitching boys faces up real right
And I never earned a dollar for it, but they locked Z-Ro up real tight
I don't pull my pistol out, unless I'mma empty that bitch
If you don't wanna get hate sent back to ya, nigga don't send me that shit
And if I say I'm coming to get ya, you might as well go on and pack up
This is permanent punishment, everytime they act up


Rolling through the hood, with my young homie Z-Ro
The K-I-N-G, of the G-H-E double T-O
Showing animosity, at every faker we know
Boys who run they suckers, get shot like a free throw

South Park Coalition, and the Screwed Up Click
Serving bar is like the law, so lace your shoes up bitch
But won't be no evading arrest, this arrest is for the cardiac
Nigga these grown man guns by X-Box, y'all still fucking with Atari gats

They steady popping in, like prostitute panties you drop again
I know lot's of men gossiping, so much they need oxygen
What we do to cappers man, the laws can't even equal
We'll be on your ass, harder than the child support people

And in case you fellas forgot, it's H-Town for life
Taking over the rap game, disrespect us we'll lay down your line
Depending on where you is on the hit list, you can lay down tonight
So make arrangements for this vacation, and enjoy the flight",https://genius.com/K-rino-talkin-loud-lyrics
Maybe It’s You,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"You got too much crazy to weave through, can’t nobody please you
What could be the reason every dude you get with leaves you?
Tell me what’s a man to do, when you so tyrannical
Oh I forgot, you too strong, these men out here can’t handle you
You too much woman for ‘em, I heard it all, every lame phrase
All of your relationships from day one end the same way
But it never clicks why you get cut loose and eliminated
It’s cause of your attitude, you say they intimidated
Get your understanding right ‘cause you don’t know what's up at all
A man won’t respect you, talk to dude like he a puppy dog
It’s all about you, if it’s not, you flip out really fast
Then can’t understand when he burn out on your silly ass
You have to dominate, you snappy with a lively mouth
Need to learn the order, girl, don’t make me pull that Bible out
You never think about fixing up your failures
Different people, same results, same complaints so what that tell ya?
Maybe it’s you

You walk around all mad like
Everybody you know done did you bad
Attitude on blaze, need to act your age
Blaming everybody else for your jacked up ways, hey
Your name bad in these streets
Same problem, same beef with everybody you meet, now
Take a minute and just give it some thought
No matter how it jumps off, it ain’t never yo fault

I know this ain’t a word but you a terrible conversator
Every controversy, bro, you the common denominator
You done ran off all your boys and every lady you dating
And the only explanation you can give is they hatin’
You never wrong, every story you gon’ put a spin on
Plus you lost every job that you’ve ever been on
From you most people separate, you got a lot of reckless traits
Women hesitate, you hardly ever get a second date
Your mind is funny, G, honestly you too blind to see
You say we ain’t on your level, I say we ain’t tryna be
In your mind you good so why get rid of your past?
It’s sad ‘cause you don’t have no real friends that’ll get on yo ass
Most women move around or find a dude stronger than you
You try to blame every female for the wrong that you do
You say that she the problem, if it was just her I could see
But you done said the same thing ‘bout the last twenty-three
Maybe it’s you

You walk around all mad like
Everybody you know done did you bad
Attitude on blaze, need to act your age
Blaming everybody else for your jacked up ways, hey
Your name bad in these streets
Same problem, same beef with everybody you meet, now
Take a minute and just give it some thought
No matter how it jumps off, it ain’t never yo fault

When you walk up, I’m leaving, Bill
Ain’t no time for me to chill
I’ma just go on and keep it real
You ain’t got no people skills
Blind, clueless, self-centered
No retreat, no surrender
You think everyone you know is here just to push your agenda
I don’t want nothing to do wit'cha
People that went to school wit’cha
Ain’t nobody really cool wit’cha
Don’t nobody really fool wit’cha
Too bossy, that’s a fact
Disrespectful, all of that
And even though your family love you, they’ve been slowly falling back
See my woman gon’ respect me
I’ma gon’ let you know directly
Stupid lines like this upset me
You knew how it was when you met me
And dudes be wanting handouts because they soft and lazy
Plus I don’t like the ignorant ways that you talk to ladies
When somebody let you know about yourself, you layin’ back
You don’t even get it, you like, “Why people keep saying that?”
Won’t nobody stay ‘cause your attitude won’t go away
You the one that got the mental issues so I say
Maybe it’s you

You walk around all mad like
Everybody you know done did you bad
Attitude on blaze, need to act your age
Blaming everybody else for your jacked up ways, hey
Your name bad in these streets
Same problem, same beef with everybody you meet, now
Take a minute and just give it some thought
No matter how it jumps off, it ain’t never yo fault

I gotta keep it pimping, I’m straight up telling you
You talking down on me, when it was really you
So how to change your ways, don’t wanna take the blame
You talkin’ out your lips, you flipped another script
You’re out here playing games, I’m playing games for keeps
I’m dropping platinum tracks, I’m ‘bout to hit these streets
I’m giving you the game, ‘cause I’m the real deal
You know you perpetrating, you never keep it real",https://genius.com/K-rino-maybe-its-you-lyrics
Witness,K-Rino,1998,"Is killing a sin? Is it?
If it is let our Lord be my Judge
If I'm above the laws of man , am I above the law of God?
I did what I had to do and now I gotta suffer the consequence

I heard a loud gun shot, who was it? I don’t really know
All I saw was this Cadillac creeping real slow
They popped him at McGregor park and left him bleeding on a bench
Saw a brother rolling of wearing some locs and a black trench
Hopped in the ‘Lac right around 12 o’clock
Realised that I had saw the whole murder so he stopped
Called me over to his window, pulled out the Glock
Threw me in the back seat, the windows rolled up, the doors locked
He said, “I know you saw this murder that just took place
So I can’t let you make it ‘cause I know you saw my face
But I got one little proposal that might save you g
I can kill you now or you can come and work for me”
He saw me thinking so he paused and then removed his locs
Look in his eyes I realised he wasn’t telling jokes
I pictured money, cars and women then my mind went
“Damn! What’s my first assignment?”

Shoot ‘em down, shoot ‘em down, committing murder for the cash
Place his body in the ground, friend or foe, I got to blast
Gunfire all around, yo, this ain’t personal, it’s business
I’m busting everybody family member and the witness

We started rolling down a dark street and took a left
I’m having flashes of that fool who just got shot to death
Flipped to his mansion where all my fear would soon decrease
Gave me a strap then they sent me for a new three-piece
Spent several hours in his office running down the game
Gave me a map, a brand new pager and a list of names
And plus a picture of my victim, kind of looked familiar
“I know this sucker, what’s the deal, he tried to kill ya?”
He said, “Don’t ever ask me questions, just end the man
Complete the job by 12 o’clock, it’s good for twenty grand”
I understand, within a week I’m quick to strike a foe
I’m pulling moves that make Al Capone look like a ho
Vision a man that went shife in during his life and done
Some shit that brought about the murder of his wife and son
I came up in the village, witnessed all them gangster hits
Needed to lick so I pulled my gun and cocked it quick
A killer’s life, it gets rougher when these busting men
Multiple massacre murders and human suffering
Obligated to bring life lost without a conscience
Funeral service is arranged over some nonsense


Received a call, got a name, a victim, time to spill him
His family member’s at my feet begging me not kill him
Seven months deep, organised crime, no love in mind
The man I had to drop was in a wheelchair and blind
His wife was crying he lost a bet tryna work his way up
But he was thirty G’s behind and it was time to pay up
I never missed a hit, I had a perfect record, check it
Done witness body shot up, burned and left in ditches naked
But for some reason, man I’m feeling kind of bad about this one
I always take my hits, so damn it wouldn’t hurt to miss one
I let him ride, “But what about that thirty thousand, black”
I say he gave it back and paid the boss right out my stack
Knew from the start that in this game I couldn’t have a heart
All of the tactics I was taught, somehow I came up short
I told a man about my plan I thought I’d left him gunless
The door flew open, I heard a voice say, “Man, you shouldn’t have done this”
It was the boss, he was testing me to see if I
Was true to him, but since I sold out it was time to die
I understood and knew the consequence of going left
Multiple gunshots to the body brought about my death

Yeah, another spine chiller from the mind killer
Get with it
I can get with it
I can get with it
I can get with it (fading)",https://genius.com/K-rino-witness-lyrics
Strangle Hold,80 Minute Eternity,2013.0,"Don’t worship me, I ain’t the Lord
I’m a flaming sword with vocal cords that can strangle a St. Bernard
I make sure when it rains it pours
Start language wars until the fluid in your brain is forced to stain the floors
My art is bold yet it’s sort of cold
Bite your face like crocodiles doing  at the waterhole
And once your camp is raided, bodies are laminated
Maybe I’ll kiss your ring once your hand is amputated
There’s morphine in my bar schemes
I slept for fourteen seconds and had twenty-five eleven part dreams
I got styles in all mixtures
Bury you in the sheet rock behind family pictures in the wall fixtures
The rap stat  attack minds
And black your vital signs until your flatline flat-lines
K-Rino the great highness teaching at the finest school where students get murdered for making a A-minus

When I swing every emcee ducks
I’m the opposite of a menage a trois ‘cause I don’t give three f*cks
Greatness cannot be rushed
When you breathe what I concede you heave of battery acid reflux
I’m lancing you like a panther’s tooth
Catch you in your dancing suit, slice you into chunks and sell cans of you
My pens are like poisonous syringes
I go on war binges and launch missiles like bars from my jaw hinges
Words I mention tend to dismember appendages
Enter his temple then spit ’til his memory hemorrhages
And when these rappers call, I’ma nap ‘em all
And need a paragraph-sniffing cadaver dog to find your dead catalog
I’m flaming men if they ever mention my name again
I claim I been through twenty thousand pens like Chamberlain
Don’t believe I’m a trip, come and see a few clips
I rip unreadable scripts that make vehicles flip

I bring to fruition atom-splitting cataclysms
The anachronism with backwards vision and mad animal mannerisms
Candles glisten as phantoms listen
I channel out a random mission, dismantling this  planet systems
My monograph’s a clad  madness
That smash physical masses to bacterial fragments
My written enigmas are unsolvable
I swept the crowd off their feet once they saw me sweep your feet off of you
As for your flow, half a million folks heard the 
So no records were sold, meaning you went negative gold
I was dropping new styles in school child
By 22, I was removing  and puttin’ ‘em on a frozen food aisle
I got a  in my head, infrared pencil lead
What I said in November left December dead
Me and my black-suited ruthless pals
Boost morale by spewing paragraphs that hit like  root canals",https://genius.com/K-rino-strangle-hold-lyrics

I Ain’t No Gangsta,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"I'm at my house just chilling and I get a call on my cell
It was my potna that I roll with, he was mad as hell
I said man just calm down I tried to talk it out with him
He said this dude jumped on his sister and he bout to go get him
I rounded up everybody so we can go in deep
He ain't goin be hard to find cause I know where he sleep
I said you know I'm down with'cha fool just tell me the plan
Cause if it was my sister, I know I'd take the law in my hand
But on the cool I know you pissed off and ya ready to peel him
But if I roll you got promise me we ain't gonna kill em
I got a family to support man and I'm all that they got
He said I ain't goin make no promises you coming or not
I said yeah, meet me ten minutes and I be on my way
I met him right there at 6-10 at M.L.K
I thought the clique would be there, but I ain't seen none of them
That when he told me what nobody riding but me and him
Damn!

I ain't no gangsta, but sometimes I fuck around with em 
I was looking at the news and what I saw wasn't good
The police had shot another youngster right in my hood
I shook my head in disbelief that this could happen again
That this time it was close to home cause it was one of my friends
I started tripping when I found out, they went and they got him
They tasered him, plus he had on handcuffs when they shot him
Five bullets to his back and not one to the chest
And then them crackers lied and said 'he was resisting arrested'
My phone ring my potna ask if I was watching the news
The whole hood had strapped up, ready to get these fools
I was ready to retaliate for real I ain't lying
Espically when I saw his momma on that TV crying
When I hit the block I couldn't believe the seen I was scoppin'
I ain't never seen that many guns just out in the open
Hit the police station, when the thoughts of attackin'
The games changes when they see they ain't the only ones packin'
Yeah

I ain't no gangsta, but sometimes I fuck around with em 

I went to the club with my potna just to kick it and laugh
We ain't plan on staying long by the hour, hour and a half
Somebody was shooting a video, the camera crew was fliming (fosho)
We just posted up against the wall just checking out women
My boy went to the bar to grab a drink and thangs was fine
I see him hollering at a female but I ain't pay him no mind
Next thang you know some fool yelled and pushed through the line
And bust my boy across the head, with a bottle of wine (man hol'up)
Do you think that should we just leave and swallow our pride?
The dude who did it, and his potna's quickly bailed outside
I looked across the club and seen my homie from the Dead End
Knew he was crazy, and he wasn't even a week out the pen
He said you know the code in the game, say the word in our click (yeah)
But you can't come back to the hood without handling these tricks
We hit the parking lot and start chopping without no warning
You wanna know what happen to em, read the paper in the morning
YEAH!

I ain't no gangsta, but sometimes I fuck around with em 
But every homeboy that I roll with, they know that I'll get down with em",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-aint-no-gangsta-lyrics
Wicked Land,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Before your mug turns, execution of slug perms
Thugs yearn for the status in money that drugs earn
Boys love searn, mission to stay above worms
For the bread, chicks stay on they knees like rug burns
We don't tell jokes, better boat when ya smell smoke
We illiterate hustlers we can't even spell broke
Youngstas sell dope and contribute to jail growth
Snitches tell folks who working ending up in twelve votes
Killas rush through, barricades that touch you
Bullets crush you and persecute before bust you
You'll be sub-earthly, went to court and the judge search me
They don't love mercy; cops are racist and blood thirsty
They submit plans, hustlers get around like wristbands
You ain't gotta pay a hit man seventy-six grand
In a big chance you better be slick with quick hands
And try'na never sell a stand by the fan where the ship lands

From the time the sunrise they devise no good
If you a G then I know I just described yo hood
If you not better watch where your drive or stand
Or mess around and make a wrong turn in the wicked land

When the war grows, more soul get foreclosed
Cats are hard nose; killas stay armed like torsos
Cars blow, up in into spark modes of charcoal
Narks roll through and beat up youngsta's on dark roads
Crammin try and grab thieves framing you finding scaps
Cadavers on slabs being an examined in crime labs (yeah)
And every picture the portraits a mad man
Torturous bad man with corpses in trash cans
Boy you Mr. Clean, plus you greener than Listerine
You ain't live to see the wicked extremes the pistol brings
Houses fit for kings, bosses who have you kissing rings
Explicit things the victims be hoping that it's a dream
But as sure as I'm rapping, this ain't no tourist attraction
The impurest of actions crafted by hooded assassins
A mob target, they'll spark it in his apartment
Wife and daughter get home they'll be walking the red carpet

From the time the sunrise they devise no good
If you a G then I know I just described yo hood
If you not better watch where your drive or stand
Or mess around and make a wrong turn in the wicked land

We take hearts, and vacation in Saint Barts
Breaking bank faults, we so wicked we shank thoughts
See we fire straps, ammo try'na to frier cams
Iron claps on the crying rath wearing wire taps
Straight raw foes, high weapons inside clothes
Can't describe those, three shots but five holes
Chasing pesos fools auction in they souls
Try'na make doe, we got judges on payrolls
Got the cerve famous, specializing in bird maintenance
We serve daily stellify ducking the surveillance
Pink shirt rippers, the enemy hersh flippers
Better work with us, tricks try'na converse strippers
Worldwide anthems, we too rugged to ride fathoms
Haters dying, cramping, killers hiding inside mansions
Then a slaughter move, you ain't leaving you outta dude
Will expose the intestinal fortitude part of you, yeah

Almost,Time Traveler,2006,"*gunshots*
Yeah, I'm bout to introduce
Potential tragedy *laughs in the background*
This song goes out to every man who
Ever been on the edge
And wanted to jump
But didn't....listen

I almost murdered my girlfriend this morning
This whole relationship has been very disappointing
We argued last night for 3 hours straight
What used to be unconditional love is now straight hate
Disrespect my manhood, I can't let her
I told her the type of dude that I was when I first met her
We clicked from day 1 and out the gate we had love
But the love we had at first turned to bad blood
More fussing and fighting and less communication
Led to a potential domestic situation
Was never satisfied with my choice of occupation
Gave no motivation, doubted my determination
Threats to put me out of her house were the worst case
Especially since I ain't wanna move in in the first place
Said she'd never throw it in my face but she was lyin'
I'm trying, but she ain't knowing she was this close to dyin'

I almost murdered my girlfriend
I almost murdered my girlfriend
I almost murdered my girlfriend this morning
Im tired of living in this hell
I'd rather be sitting in a jail cell
I almost murdered my girlfriend

I almost murdered my girlfriend this morning 
At least 3 or 4 times I gave her fair warning
Unemployed, waiting for my money to improve
She was paying the bills so she started putting power moves
Telling me I ain't a man, I'm sorry and I'm lazy
Talking to me in ways she never did and it's crazy
Never mentioned the time when she didn't have a dime
I grinded for her and two kids that wasn't even mine
Now the tables done turned and my pockets are clean
I started seeing her true colors and that color was green
You either love me or you don't love me, ain't no in-between
Using your money as a weapon on my self esteem
Telling your friends all our problems you cried and lied
If you gon' put em in our business and these terrible signs
While they telling you what their husbands and boyfriends do
You on the phone complaining about what I ain't doing for you
That's why..


She lay down and fell asleep without making the bed up
I'm fed up, her dirty friends pumping her head up
I ain't tripping on making love cuz even when we do
I'm trying to do my best to visualize any woman but you
But im sure you do the same thing too
Our problems ain't nothing new
Good times are far and few
You ask for my advice but when I hand it you drop it quick
Like you just wanna know what I'ma say so you can do the opposite
Years ago I should've quit you, you swung at me
I grabbed your hand, you told the police that I hit you
Official, theres too many problems we couldn't get through
Plus some issues with this one dude you refused to admit to
You wanna know a man? Study and see
Don't judge what he is today, try to see what he could be
I didn't kill her, I spared her life
But the next night I woke up and caught her standing over me with a knife",https://genius.com/K-rino-almost-lyrics
Zero Gravity,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"Keep going up, keep going up
Lets see if we can do it, man, let’s see, watch

Tramp MCs, I turn into amputees, you ramming these fantasies
While I’m making cameras freeze, rapping in amber knees
Electricity couldn’t stand with me
So light spurts randomly land on my hand when I write and service lamps for me
Instantly my pen or my pencil be overcome with the propensity
To spin for three hours, building up energy
Infantries are crushed by the density
What interests me is relentlessly practicing tying my shoes mentally
My altitude and vision is exceptional
I can see every section through my special multidirectional spectacles
I keep intestinals as collectibles, plus the damage is irreparable
Then once I wreck you right there’s nothing left of you
In each place of my conscious state I freebase
And walk around with half of deep space inside a briefcase
I outrace these snakes in three shakes
And breeze past MC fakes easy wearing a concrete-based knee brace
The massive wrath of me in its totality is packed with accuracy
And rap daggers that's flabbergasted your faculty
The rap he had for me was a travesty
And actually it’s sad ‘cause he was not the first to never see the last of me
My monograph’s forcasted bombastically
The one man staff that had the pain that he was in screaming in agony
I'm manufacturing sadness happily and mind-lifting gravity
While sipping on a gasoline daiquiri
Powerful tracks compacted with hours of facts
Defied logic when I snatched myself up out of a hat
You won’t win, incompetent men I’m stomping again
I didn’t drown in the quicksand, it sunk in my skin
I can straight create a verse ’til the paper hurts
Everyday eliminate the time you wake just to purposely make you late for work
I’m blasting this guy with a classic reply
My flames are strange, you don’t feel ‘em burn ’til after you die
We had to be fast in my PE class
Our feet had speed blast that we used to play overseas freeze tag
I crash into accidents, smashed ribs
Don’t exit tracks all at once, I’m dropping lead vocals, backs and ad-libs
I’m opening wounds and smokin' ya goons
My pictures don’t hang on the wall, they float in the room
I rest and summon my best 'til your lung is compressed
Dressed in a built-in bulletproof vest up under my flesh
The red rum will quickly come and leak from thee
And even if I wasn’t who I was, I would practice ’til I become me
Come in my office and talk with the grand exalted
My brain  seven story walk-in closet
My greatest flow is to come, twenty rolled into one
Vocals I run are cold enough to make it snow on the Sun
The mic’s gravity snatches me like magnets attracting me
My cameras be bright enough to illuminate galaxies
I force clowns to wrap up in corpse shrouds
My voice is loud enough to stand on my porch and be heard on the Oort cloud
My sound growled ’til the whole town bowed
The crowds don’t gather around me, I gather around crowds
My stats be like that of a great athlete
Put me on a pitch black street with a pack of crack fiends hoping to jack me
Or the backseat of a runaway taxi full of rats with bad teeth
Tryna attack me and it still wouldn’t distract me
I deliver a rap then I’ll give you a slap
Across your cap, that’s so exact it makes your fibula snap
See I respond to ya by puncturing your cornea
Abnormal mental formulas confusing like dreaming you got insomnia
These rotten vipers want a title shot, it’s not every night I jot
But I’m more creative than a lot of y’all with writer’s block
My seven senses  uplifted
So gifted that even my repetition is different
I  around the Earth great
My elevator goes straight to the ninth floor without passing the first eight
I lit up the whole night with a speck of light
And set records by having fans recite complex lines that I’m yet to write
Facing K, that’s disintegration
I’ll chase your next life back to this one and then I switch ‘em, backwards reincarnation
I’m breaking great time barrier records
By magically living 700 minutes per second
Talent heaven sent so I’m evicting the evil resident
I travel at F-111 speed when I’m hesitant
Spoke ferocious opuses at horrible doses
Post hypnotic suggestions before the hypnosis
I provide a dope vocal kaleidoscope, you hopelessly choke when I tie the rope
Even when I’m sleeping, I’m wide awoke
I hold a slew of new poems, dude
I wrote a few to show and prove so I’m underhandedly overthrowing you
I’m not a model, you volatile, I throttle
So hostile I make painkillers holler through the bottle
Can’t topple my knowledge if daily you swallowed you a novel
I’m philosophical but I don’t follow Aristotle
Please don’t be on the street when the heat come
23 vehicles rolling up with me at the wheel of each one
I leap from thought with a deep plunge
I pick out your weak lung and run a straw through it like a Capri Sun
Peep the secretive mystique, he writes albums in his sleep
He completed at least eleven this week
His little scheme was negated
‘cause I had already premeditated the plans to the plan that he premeditated
Standing on a lyrical landscape
Jumping from outer space feet first, hoping to pancake a man’s face
Plus my handshakes make hands break, crumble like bran flakes
It only takes 3 shots to kill your fanbase",https://genius.com/K-rino-zero-gravity-lyrics
Differences,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"There’s a difference between feeling good and being healthy
There’s a difference between being rich and being wealthy
Just ‘cause you lend me a hand doesn’t mean you wanted to do it
Wishing for something ain’t the same as working to pursue it
Never mislead yourself about want and need
Determination to succeed gets mistaken for greed
Just because something’s inactive doesn’t mean it’s useless
And being ignorant is not the same as stupid
It’s a difference between valid reasons why and excuses
And randomly hitting notes can’t be confused with music
What’s the distinction between a real friend and a homie?
And being alone doesn’t mean a person is lonely
A threat and a warning, being lazy or dormant
Is being a snitch the same thing as an informant?
Being nosy is not the same as being suspicious
It’s something missing ‘cause you misconstruing prayers and wishes

Every word has significance
That’s a fact
But you’ll be alright once you learn to understand the differences
We place a lot of false emphasis
But you’ll be alright once you learn to understand the differences
Words are only confusing, if we lack the comprehension and we don’t know what we using
Words are only confusing, if we lack the comprehension and we don’t know what we using

Paying the mortgage is not the same as just paying rent
There’s a difference between happiness and being content
It’s division, givin’ is not the same as lending
What about money? Question is are you investing or spending
Being in a hurry is different from being in a rush
Natural physical attraction is different from lust
The misunderstandings are clear, too often we hear
Many times in life, we confuse caution with fear
Once again a smile doesn’t mean a person’s sincere
And of course a job ain’t necessarily a career
The strongest is not always the biggest opponent
And in business an advance is not the same as a bonus
Still working doesn’t mean still relevant
Commonsense differs from intelligence and speculation’s not evidence
A valuable asset or a frivolous purchase
Don’t misinterpret admiration of a person that’s worshipped

Every word has significance
That’s a fact
But you’ll be alright once you learn to understand the differences
We place a lot of false emphasis
But you’ll be alright once you learn to understand the differences
Words are only confusing, if we lack the comprehension and we don’t know what we using
Words are only confusing, if we lack the comprehension and we don’t know what we using

There’s a difference between someone you don’t know and a stranger
Trouble and danger, don’t confuse being upset with anger
Two distinct definitions of life and living
Some lack the recognition of knowing a dream from a vision
Observing and slowing learning, or straight being taught
A well formulated idea or simply a thought
Don’t have to be aware of your presence just ‘cause I’m near you
Me staying out of your way doesn’t mean that I fear you
There’s a difference between somebody hearing and listening
Battle and war, pain and hurt, abuse and discipline
Being nice and gullible, believing and knowing
Reading and studying, giving a demonstration and showing
Patterned after or imitated, disliked or hated
Asking for help and begging, being family and related
Religious and spiritual, adult age and grown
And just because you have a house doesn’t mean it’s a home

Every word has significance
That’s a fact
But you’ll be alright once you learn to understand the differences
We place a lot of false emphasis
But you’ll be alright once you learn to understand the differences
Words are only confusing, if we lack the comprehension and we don’t know what we using
Words are only confusing, if we lack the comprehension and we don’t know what we using",https://genius.com/K-rino-differences-lyrics
Remember,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Remember
In everyone you see is an illusion
Cloud of smoke
C'mon
You are a cloud as well
It's all about how long the smoke last

There was a lady who had lost a husband and she was stressing
Mentally second guessing and questioning God's blessings
In her eyes for that man the sun would set and rise
Two years into the marriage met an un-timing demise
Depression multiplies from everything she had gone through
Stop working then became isolated and mournful
Before I go further into this I gotta warn you
She now about to take a trip into the paranormal
Laying in the room tears falling in volumes
A voice from the corner said ""what is your problem?
The pain is hard to shake maybe that's true
But our love is infinite"" she said 'baby is that you? '
""Yes and I'm kinda upset at my wife
Why are you acting like you dead when you still have life?
She said 'I'm missing you' told her ""I know that'cha sad
But be glad God let us have the moments we had""

Remember
The times we had
I know that
Your heart is sad
Don't worry
About how things seem to be
I want you to be glad
When you think of me

Young fella going crazy try'na achieve peace
He had just lost his oldest brother to these streets
The man hadn't been into the ground for two months
He decided to go wild and pull a few stunts
Outside the store, ready to take a chance
Before he walked in he felt something grab his hand
He didn't see anyone he dropped his drink
Heard his brother speak saying ""stop and think
Why are you tripping put that pistol down?
Don't you know that's the reason I'm no long around? ""
He said 'I'm hurt bro, you not being hear disappoints me'
""I understand that but keep it up and you'll join me""
'Why'd you have to leave? ' ""I was foolish now I'm done
How you think mama would feel if she lost another son?
You gotta chance to see things out of the seed
Go home and change your life bro, be better than me""


C'mon, yeah life is cold
His momma passed away when he was twelve years old
Shooked off the relatives and foster homes
By sixteen suicidal thoughts was strong
Out of his real mind plotting was skill
Took a bottle and said, 'I'm a bout to swallow these pills'
About to take his own self out in round one
Heard a soft voice say ""put the bottle down, son
You don't need too letting grief defeat you
I love you; I never intended to leave you""
'Yeah but you still did anyhow'
She said ""Yes, so it's time to be a grown man now
You never had a father in ya life but I thought you would be strong enough to utilize what I taught you""
'Ok momma what'chu want me to do? '
""Live and give life to others like I gave it to you""",https://genius.com/K-rino-remember-lyrics
Flowers,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Life is fragile man
But we can't play around being too big to look somebody that we love in the eyes and say hey man, i love you bro, i love you sis'
Its time we snatching people up left & right
So you got something on your heart to say man
Give the folk their flowers right now man, yeah right right now
Let's go

Check on your people if you love 'em then you need to show it
How come we wait for them to die before we let them know it?
The most important thing to say to 'em we never say
Took them for granted 'cause you're used to seeing them everyday
Neglecting calls so communication went astray
Might not be doing it on purpose, life got in the way
You're saying to yourself it's cool I'll catch them later on
And then you find out that they're gone now that chance is blown
Man... So now your feelings come rushing in
Wishing to hear their voice or for their hand to touch again
It's troubling dealing with that kind of suffering
You had time but with them never enough to spend
So now you're at the funeral full of regret and tearful
Wasting your time talking to them now because they can't hear you
The loving words that they gave you you didn't give them back
The fact that you didn't tell them, you gotta live with that

Give them flowers while they still can smell 'em
If there is a certain way inside your heart you feel then tell them
Never hesitate to say it, do it when you can
Don't put no flowers on no casket, put 'em in their hand

You didn't speak and now the grief is tearing you to pieces
So now we printing t-shirts and doing balloon releases
Candlelight vigils and murals for a painful reason
But never gave that kind of attention when they were breathing
Don't get me wrong, I know the life should be celebrated
But we be waiting too late for them to appreciate it
Now you regret that you didn't tell 'em or send a message
The words that you never express when they were in your presence
We beef with people and relationships are often ruined
Friends and family, we might go years without talking to 'em
Reconciling is something we ought to start pursuing
Our hearts are moving opposite of what the thoughts are doing
So now a heavy load of guilt is landing on you
Go tell ya partners you love 'em while they're standing on two
Ego and hesitation got you in a blind mind
Until you see that R.I.P 
flooding their timeline

Give them flowers while they still can smell 'em
If there is a certain way inside your heart you feel then tell them
Never hesitate to say it, do it when you can
Don't put no flowers on no casket, put 'em in their hand",https://genius.com/K-rino-flowers-lyrics
I Miss,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Let's go back
You can come with me
Cause we all got a place in the past
That we like to go sometimes
I'm a share ya mines

When life was real simple man I miss those days
When it wasn't all about bills and tryna get paid
Free as a young bird, remember that great age
When all you had to do was go to school and make the grades
My momma brought me every new toy that came out
And we all congregated at my grandmother's house
And when she tell ya 'stop running in and out' that's what she mean
And the only job you had was too keep your room clean
But soon things got deeper developed romances
And getting phone numbers and slow dragging at dances
And your partners roll with ya right or wrong, clean or dirty
If you curfew was at 10 you beg for 10: 30
You was considered cool if your game ran smooth
And dude got ranked outta the schools for fake name brand shoes
And it was always funny as long as it's not you
Even through the tough times ungrateful I got through

When we was young and the only thing we did was laugh and play
(Laugh and play)
Making music hanging out in the hood just to pass the day
(Just to pass the day, c'mon)
We didn't always have a lot of money but that's ok
Cause we was cool just as long as our hands had a place to lay
(Guess what)
I miss those times

My first talent shows and my high school crushes
Liking the girls so much I would catch 2 buses
But the times spend with em is well worth the odyssey
And the goodnight kiss was just like hitting the lottery
Coming back around your homeboys high-capping
And lying like a dog when they ask ya what happened
My homies in my hood is where I got my skill from
When it was my turn to swing I was nervous but still swung
Connected to those memories constantly gilding through me
I miss Saturday morning cartoons and karate movies
And rapping on the street corners battling everyday
With MC Ice, GT, Preppy J, and Rapper K
Who win at playing football? I love those times
And hanging out with Guy, Mark, Hopie, Michael, and Brian
And walking Sterling hallways I always miss
So let's get Metter green 84 through 86

When we was young and the only thing we did was laugh and play
(Laugh and play)
Making music hanging out in the hood just to pass the day
(Just to pass the day, c'mon)
We didn't always have a lot of money but that's ok
Cause we was cool just as long as our hands had a place to lay
(Guess what)
I miss those times

I miss Club Boomerang, hanging and chillin' out
And mobbing on Roseneath at LV's house
The whole crew was chillin' my spot was the headquarters
And not the kind of place you want your sister or your daughter
Me and Z, KO, and A.C. Chill remember this?
Having video games wars on Sega Genesis
Shooting ball at McGregor Park back when it was poppin'
When X-Men had the rock, nobody could stop em
And me and Ganksta NIP we stayed in battle mode
And me and Tech DBX and Q was on the road
Young Felon and Brain-dead, we hung like that
And my homie Murder One, Wreek and Klondike Kat
And Dope-E and Point Blank and PSK
I thought them days would last forever now they gone away
Cause everybody got families now and green to stack
Still I wish I could rewind the tape and bring it back, c'mon

When we was young and the only thing we did was laugh and play
(Laugh and play)
Making music hanging out in the hood just to pass the day

We didn't always have a lot of money but that's ok

Word Mastery,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"Yeah
Y'all bout to witness word mastery
K-Water in the building, D-1 in the building
Ya boy K-Rino
This how we goin' to do
We operate on a high plane
Y'all boys crashed-landed years ago
So check the flow
Listen
I'm warning ya
With two bars I'm vocally embalming ya
When it comes to harming ya I got seventy different formulas
Torment ya with a punch that left my whole right arm in ya
On a twenty thousand mile land strip I still corner ya
I granulate em in a powered form when I'm done with em
Correspond with warm sun rays and become one with them
My substances is trusted I saw the mic and I lust it
I'll spit a verse that'll rupture your bicuspid and bust it
My exhibitions is giving the victims and repetition
With a clarity of a television with high definition
I'll crack you, at rasta member tabernacle
Hover and cover you with a verbal wing span of a pterodactyl
Wickedly wreck styles with vocal projectiles
That affect you and leave piles of organs that stretch miles
An emergency ensued (yeah) every word would be approved
And when you lose at a verse that I use is every surgically removed
I interrogate rap bandits and narrate parables
And burn ya outer flesh til your skin is unwearable
Your ghost in a gallow, your chances are narrow
You can't see me in battle my tongue cast the eighty mile shadow (yeah)
Your ask for the truth, I'm a give you actual proof
The top of my head slides back like a retractable roof
Your flow is awful; to the logical articles I'm impartial
You broke the law and got your whole committee court marshaled

You witnessing word mastery skill at his highest
It don't matter if you home or not it ain't wise to try this
Have of em got deals but I doubt they hit
Boy don't ever fix ya mouth and say the south can't spit
YEAH!
I'll eventually get in ya head, conduct symphonies when ya dead
An unseen entity that pins ya to ya bed
I minimize your stare, the pilot who flies the craft
My slightest cerebral vibration's malfunction a seismograph
I blast those critics with astro-physics
A trillion square my word total past those digits
Never been frivolous, the clever verb biberist word deliver
Who murdered every insurgent an ignorant co-conspirator
The sober lyricist, who achieves advancements without weed enhancement
With seventeen angels who proofread my pamphlets
They dropping me, tender posits of quantum technology
The cosmic brainstorms that defy meteorology
For my thoughts I make no apologies (uh-uh)
As I speak knowledge and teach you the difference between astronomy and astrology (ha)
I impede you and cut you so bad with what I read you
That a hundred stab wound victims couldn't out bleed you",https://genius.com/K-rino-word-mastery-lyrics
Make A Move,Danger Zone,1995,"I’m the keeper of the chamber, MCs confronted with danger
I increase the pain by magnifying 600 levels of anger
What was he that would choose me?
Comprehend a thousand trigonometry equations couldn’t confuse me
Student said, “Teacher, teach me the skills”, I show him
Taught him my powers, then he challenged me, so I blowed him
Not into criming ‘cause rhyming is a clever racket
I love my Black Book like Fonzy love that leather jacket
Don’t wanna battle one MC, I’d have took on three
I’m so intelligent I got phonics hooked on me
Extracurricular vernacular reign supreme
The hieroglyphic scientifical sorcerer king
When K-Rino is in the zone, I do what I like
I might just quit for seven years and come back like Mike
Better than ever with new styles that have never been done
Verses directly from the year 3001

So make a move if you feel like you wanna test
The microphone is a gun aiming at your chest
So make a move if you feel like you wanna test
The microphone is a gun aiming at your chest

Yo, I got your head in the guillotine
Whip the mic across his neck in this rough radical rhyme scene
My words are poison, my thoughts nonconsumable
Pass the Gun save the Roses for his funeral
You wanna test me on that mic you can sing a rap
But if you step up to me wrong you better bring a strap
MCs run up on the ground and kick a rap I hate
So I state vocals to make bodies evaporate
You're weak as water, that's why I'm blowing you out
Water’s H2O but for you we’ll take the 2 out
Travel to the deepest of the infinite chambers of skill
Laid in a pool of piranha just to test my will
He had to get some backup for the rhymes I shot
Came back with thirty MCs, I laughed and said, “That’s all you got?”
Boy if you cross me, I promise I’m coming to see ya
Float like a butterfly but sting like gonorrhoea
When I’m writing I picture rage
Thoughts take action, it’s so agg that the words jump off the page
Be rapper microphone magician and heed the fist
Who have I, bitch? You got three hours, I’ll read the list

So make a move if you feel like you wanna test
The microphone is a gun aiming at your chest
So make a move if you feel like you wanna test
The microphone is a gun aiming at your chest

Don’t make a move, if you do bring your gun
Me know them have to shoot me ‘cause them scared one on one
Me float like a spirit through the park in the night
Then lock down them haters with the verse that me write

I’m tired of playing with these suckers on that mic, I’m ready to hurt
And start to slaying all these brothers I don’t like by putting in work
You got one more thing to say about my skills before I stress
Or this tongue gon’ sing today and bust a hole up in his chest
See I try to be cool with wack MCs but still they play me though
Now I gotta be cruel then show them they can’t step to K-Rino
If we spit some, I fold 'em 'cause my vocal blast don’t bluff
Wanna get some? Don’t hold them, let him run his ass on up
I’m so real on that mic I don’t need to pack
Calgon took him away but I snatched his ass right back
MCs, y’all ain’t on that level to bang with me
Boy, you could be my nuts and you still couldn’t hang with me
‘Cause I got the skills them sucker punks I’m housing
I got brothers by the hundreds, murder weapons by the thousands
Plus I’m deeper than any rapper in the Solar System
Hands I smould him with, blame it on the brass knucks I swoll’ them with
‘Cause err, if you jump you’ll land in this world and die
Like all the suckers that I crack that sterling high
So let’s square off like some gunslingers
But I’m so quick I pull my gun turn around and snatch your gun with one finger

So make a move if you feel like you wanna test
The microphone is a gun aiming at your chest
So make a move if you feel like you wanna test
The microphone is a gun aiming at your chest",https://genius.com/K-rino-make-a-move-lyrics
Under The Radar,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"K-Rino and Dougie D
They can't see us

See I'm known but unknown before now and after
You ain't never heard of me but I'm your partner's favorite rapper
See tryna locate me on VH1
Is like tryna find a ice cube in the heart of the Sun
You won't find me on billboard or a radio track
I'm hood platinum I went wood but never got a plaque
I stay coming after you, commercial rap a neck grappler
Chitlin' Circuit underground railroad traveler
How many artists can thrive on raw skills
And travel the planet selling out shows with no deal?
My circle got Blacks, Whites, Latinos and Asians
Who represented for K-Rino on many occasions
The ghetto grinder, real rhymer, the bread finder
Who murders the stage and embarrasses the headliner
Y'all music is garbage, the mainstream is doomed
You ain't gotta acknowledge me but you gon' know I'm in the room

We be travelling under the radar, and under the line
But over yo head, same time start spraying
Leaven em wet, that's why we a threat
Breaking the rules that y'all set

Look into the hourglass, living through this every time
Spitting numbers of rawest and the realest rhymes and I
Under the radar, under the ground
Where a muthafucka what'cha stay 'bound but hell naw, shit
And who had boys in the club with they clothes paint
... dancing with hoes right?
And that's the type of shit they put on the radio
I ain't hating bro, this is some real shit need to be heard fo
Now how you overlook at making these challenges you could learn something
Power minds in his work and you buying that you heard from em
It comes afraid of this ghetto gospel
Tried to give you people knowledge, keep muthafuckers wanna try to hide it from it
And naw dawg, that Dougie D see he fight
Dougie come in the hood out the trunk to keep these streets right
And naw dawg, that Dougie D see he fight
Dougie up in the hood out the trunk to keep these streets right

We be travelling under the radar, and under the line
But over yo head, same time start spraying
Leaven em wet, that's why we a threat
Breaking the rules that y'all set

Picture me stepping into a meeting with label excecs
Flanked by a ruthless attorney and two ex-convicts
Digesting all the BS they tried to hand cam
Across the table telling me what I can and can't say
Saying that I'm oughta dumb-down to be on the label
Picture me getting agg, losing it and flipping the table
Scaring the Hell out of the staff and shaking them older guys
Being asked to leave before authorities are notified
A conspiracy to make us ignorant is being drilled
Name travelling the wire, blackballed for being real
Fools presenting me with nonsense with hopes are bending me
Over, tryna rape and take my industry virginity
But I'ma street mash and no spins but found grand's
With ten dollar a pop hand to hand sound scans
Written, produced, arranged, composed and financed by K
So when you see me you seeing the head man

We be travelling under the radar, and under the line
But over yo head, same time start spraying
Leaven em wet, that's why we a threat
Breaking the rules that y'all set",https://genius.com/K-rino-under-the-radar-lyrics
Drownin’ in Blood,No Mercy,1999.0,"Gotta get a few things off my chest
Understand the race is not to the swift
But the one that can endure to the end
The prophet of man, the game, the whole world
Haha and lose his soul
So let me roll

Came in this world with a loaded gun dead in my mouth
I stuck my hand off in some shit that I couldn't wash off
I need a brother, not a nigga 'cause a nigga be fraud
I be striving tryna make these haters give me my card
I never cried over no bullshit, you weak if you do
‘Cause there’s always somebody that struggling harder than you
See back in ‘92, I would have laughed like it was a joke
If you’d of told me that by ‘99 I'd still be broke
But being broke has kept me motivated, able to strive
I witness motherfuckers die around me tryna survive
Brainstorming when I'm pissed off, style switch in a rhyme
Infinite levels of deepness ‘cause I'm rich in the mind
Them snakes fucked up my last tape but still it was good
But them bitches better not ever step one foot in my hood
I ain't ashamed to say it's hatred, so envision the flood
I can't wait to see you motherfuckers drowning in blood

I can't wait to see you hoes drowning in blood
Drowning in blood, drowning in blood
Leaving all my foes face down in the mud
Drowning in blood, drowning in blood

Fools live life defiant
Claiming their computers are Y2K compliant, shit
Picture darkness like power lines cut down
Starting a famine ‘cause America is shut down
Motherfuckers running wild and killing for a taste
So called technology ineffective, so millions go to waste
Yo, Benjamin’s ain't jack, you work years to get 'em
Now they worthless, you could even take a shit and wipe your ass with 'em
Some say my life is like Jekyll and Hyde
I'm cool in the world but on my tape it's straight homicide
It's like a war, deep inside the mind where murders are fast
I'm like an aggravated hurricane inside of a glass
But when I overcome this World War I'll still need help
‘Cause once I beat them hoes I still got to fight with myself
I ain't ashamed to say it's hatred, so envision the flood
I can't wait to see you motherfuckers drowning in blood

I can't wait to see you hoes drowning in blood
Drowning in blood, drowning in blood
Leaving all my foes face down in the mud
Drowning in blood, drowning in blood

10 times 10 equal a 100 ways to peel 'em
I listen to these rappers but I still don't feel 'em
Jacking cars, rims and jewellery all on your hand
Ign'ant ass motherfuckers need to rap about buying some land
Something to build on, something that’s true
Something to live on, that shit you buying is living on you
You got a tight ride, you ain't in the wrong
But your kids don't wanna live up in no car when you gone
You need a legacy, a foundation, something that’s clear
So a 100 years from now people will know you was here
I heard your album, it was jamming but your words lacked powers
Need to think beyond the hood because the world is ours
Raise your mind level, how much shit can one fool smoke up?
The planet got broke up when the sleeping giant woke up
If you hate me, I hate you, I got love if you down
I hope we all can touch a billion so them haters can drown

I can't wait to see you hoes drowning in blood
Drowning in blood, drowning in blood
Leaving all my foes face down in the mud
Drowning in blood, drowning in blood",https://genius.com/K-rino-drownin-in-blood-lyrics
Astral Projection,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Tonight I'll practice astral projection
Step out on myself and grasp introspection
Traveling in a supernatural direction
On a fast path to master perfection
I laid in the bath and tried to rest easy
Felt the energy inside my flesh leave me
The theory that I was using was now proven
I looked down at it, my body was not moving
I wasn't using or substance abusing
I could have been hallucinating, but it was soothing
I've landed in a land that was out of man's vision
Into the grand interest I made the transition
I elevated to another level in my feelings
Then I levitated steadily and floated through the ceiling
I was looking at the city as I'm  above it
I didn't know what I was doing but it's crazy 'cause I love it

So now I'm floating through the sky
Looking at my body from a place so high
Relaxing as I fly
Can't use nothing but my mind
Then go through space and time
To this earthly shell of mine
I'm no longer confined
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

I was merely trying to test out the theory
I spoke clearly yet nobody could hear me
I'm cruising like me and the planet Earth's exclusive
Totally aware, I'm conscious and lucid
It's catalyst, needed a concrete analysis
And I was sure that it was not sleep paralysis
Lathered with happiness after seeing that it was adequate
Gleeful and adamant as I repeated the pattern with
Total control, relaxation as I fade in
To a state of new vibrations I bathe in
It durably covered me with the security
And assuredly wiped out every impurity
I was able to see, no longer enslaved in the grief
My spirit was overtaken by a wave of relief
I could feel my anatomy when it started to heal
Which revealed you got to destroy in order to build

So now I'm floating through the sky
Looking at my body from a place so high
Relaxing as I fly
Can't use nothing but my mind
Then go through space and time
To this earthly shell of mine
I'm no longer confined
(yeah, yeah, yeah)

The rough water I navigated was now steady
To re-enter the body I exited I was ready
Carefully I was trekking in a downwards trajectory
But panicked a second because my body was rejecting me
The deafening pressure level negatively affected me
So did I beg into this travel method unethically?
Had it gotten the best of me and unexpectedly set me an effigy
For disrespectfully letting my essence leave?
I was in awe at the place that I saw
Now I'm crying at my soul as it faces the floor
The pervasive allure I was chasing before
Was no longer a priority case anymore
I couldn't get through, feeling like an incompetent fool
To consolidate the two was all I wanted to do
Then I got a sign word that I was hoping to find
Stop trying to enter the body and go through the mind

So now I'm floating through the sky
Looking at my body from a place so high
Relaxing as I fly
Can't use nothing but my mind
Then go through space and time
To this earthly shell of mine
I'm no longer confined

Wish I Could Smile,Universal Curriculum (The Big Seven #1),2016.0,"Everybody know how much hate this world brung out
I guess that’s why babies be screaming when they come out
Minute after minute, struggle can’t take one off
The days is even dark, somebody musta pissed the Sun off
Now, how the hell am I supposed to smile at that?
Never understood how boys be cheesing when their pockets flat
Can’t help slackers, gotta cut the love off
Hanging ‘round broke people, broke thoughts rubbed off
I don’t do nothing for the sound of applause
The only thing I truly own can be found in my drawers
Frustration and aggravation, what’s the number one cause?
Inside of fake homies, haters, baby-mamas and laws
My own problem, I can’t iron it out
So now I’m crying every night on my psychiatrist’s couch
Going in, thinking ‘bout my dead partners and I teared up
Life is so cold, I watch the news to get cheered up

I wish I could smile, baby
Ninety percent of the time, I usually don’t give a fuck
I’m cool but everybody around me so fucked up
I say I wish I could smile, baby
Life is a bitch then you die
Maybe then me and my people can smile

Y’all already know it’s been hard and sometimes I wanted to die
And since I never been too much of a man to cry
Many days with a face full of water
Stressing like I wonder if my daughter’s really my daughter
Bitchass IRS done froze all of my bank accounts
Keith Harris, I’ma whoop your ass for that, just giving you something to think about
Tampering with evidence and misdemeanor possessions
State troopers treated a nigga like they saw me with a weapon
Attorney general so greedy, they like, “We need mo’
That’s all you got, Mr. McVey? Ain’t you a CEO?”
It might be easy for you to smile, but you ain’t me
Been on probation since February, but I still ain’t free
2Pac said you gotta find a way to smile through the bullshit
Otherwise, every ten seconds, you’ll be like, “This some bullshit”
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn’t blessed, I’d probably try to blow my brains out
Smile

I wish I could smile, baby
Ninety percent of the time, I usually don’t give a fuck
I’m cool but everybody around me so fucked up
I say I wish I could smile, baby
Life is a bitch then you die
Maybe then me and my people can smile

You niggas rather see me frowning than smiling and getting it
But I been had the world on my shoulders, I’m a soldier, God is my witness
Better know the street life will turn you out
But if you a street nigga, that 9-to-5 might burn you out
So you thinking of a better way to get cash, dodging the feds and the dope pad
I-10 with a chicken and a dough stack  as the world turns slow, I move fast
X on my back and the penitentiary on my heels
Got me weaving through these snakes, ready to bust the steel, peel at will
That’s real, so why in the fuck would I trust y’all haters?
Y’all ain’t ‘bout that gangsta shit, you can put my name on some paper
Ain’t no loyalty in you, ain’t no rules that you play by
It’s cutthroat on everybody for the fame and the stay fly
Is you serious? I thank God for the mind that he gave me
To help me navigate the street life and to slip these shadies
Klondike Kat gon’ keep them snakes back ‘cause they hatin’ is crazy
But I’ma stay forever real until they dirt and they grave me, that’s why I smile",https://genius.com/K-rino-wish-i-could-smile-lyrics
Plantation Rebellion,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"I'm on the front line cause I'm a soldier watched closely by the vultures
Seeking to find my culture, had a good run now your time is over
How long can America Stand? Bucks carried out like savages man
Born with no character and claimed you discovered inhabited land
No reason why you should care, truth get told and you look scared
Ask the Indians who are spared, save your life and you took there
Came out the cave they prayed for us, they prayed on us
Obeying the ways of wicked wig wearing slave owners
The persecution frequent, this dirty ship is sinking
You must be drinking if your thinking I got love for Lincoln
History can prove what Honest Abe was thinking of you
Go read his writing then tell me if you thinks he loves you
310 years later and under masters feet
Emancipated but we still got our asses beat
Dragged in streets but we kept on swimming in the hate
The spent a hundred more years tryna integrate

Check the time and what must be done is on a crucial
America is broke the slave is no longer useful
They want you dead and want nothing you bring to 'em
They tryna cut you loose so why you trying to cling to 'em
They mistreat but you still do everything through 'em
You ain't gonna do nothing but protest and sing to 'em
Dance and entertain and show your bling bling to 'em
Good slaves stay no matter how dirty the King do 'em
Don't understand that you better become a fast learner
In February how come they don't mention Nat Turner
That all we knew was savagery, yo that's a fallacy
Make sure you know your facts before you try to challenge me
Study the history, no lies are coming out of me
What's the reason why the slave was not allowed to read?
They acted cowardly because they knew your power, G
You need to know it take them shackles off and follow me

Quit viewing them as God, stop begging for a job
Let's make our presence known, stop murdering your own
Fight to put down the drugs, learn about who we was
Better yet who we are, descendants of Allah
They still lynching, where you think all the dope is from
They still lynching, they just traded in the ropes for guns
Selling debt in many forms waiting for us to buy it
They still lynching they rig up laws and justify it
Yo what's up with all the water and with the air you breathe?
He cut you loose years ago, how come you scared to leave?
How come you think you equal? You feel like life is great
How come you call yourself Americans despite the hate?
You fell for the tricks, fell for that pack of lies
How come whenever they do something sick you act surprised
Disillusioned cause he lets you wear them suits and ties
Marry his daughter, wear his name but when he shoots you die

Me coming to get ya
Me coming to get ya (gun shot)
(Verse One)
I'm so damn depressed
In South Park, nights are fear, days are stress
Brothers telling me to watch out for my ass
Living where cops and dope fiends attack fast
Yo, wearing gold one Sunday
Punks threatened to gun me, took my shit from me
I know how complicated the game get
Thinking to myself, ""I'm finna roll with the same shit""
So my job days are finished
Why work a week for some shit that I can get in five minutes?
Me and K.O. start to roll in
Got to the point where a hard look left a punk's face swollen
Brothers scared when I pass through
They just don't know, I'm scared of they ass too
So how could I give a positive response
Your negativity created a monster
(Hook 4X)
Me coming to get ya
Me coming to get ya (gun shot)
(Verse Two)
I'm so damn depressed
Met this girl, fell in love with no second guess
Things seem right for the first time
But them quiet ass hoes are the worst kind
Thinking of the things I bought her ass
(She was a freak?) Damn straight, I caught her ass
With a punk I hate, wasn't no hiding 'im
On a water bed at a hotel riding him, yo
Now my next girl paying for my ex-girl' mistake
Cause I'm thinking they all fake
Birthday and Christmas, they came every day to me
Broke hoes got nothing to say to me
I gave her the game and she stuck with it
What's yours is mine and what's mine, don't fuck with it
Females who want a positive response
Your negativity created a monster

Me coming to get ya
Me coming to get ya (gun shot)
(Verse Three)
I'm so damn depressed
My brother is dead with bullet wounds in his chest
I asked this girl what kid to hit, what punk's lid to split
Stop crying and tell me who did the shit
She pointed at this trick in a blue shirt
I looked around, noticed some of my crew hurt
Realize there's nothing I can do, no matter how much I wanted
Cause this blue shirt had a badge on it
(point blank range, point blank range)
BOOM! It bust a cap and now I'm laying guts, spraying
Wasn't through yet, me and K.O
Shot another round, foot to the flo', time to go
Went home, thinking of blood spill, drowned my guilt
In some ice cream and milk and sat back and built
A bomb outta some shit that MacGyver would use
Went to the grid substation and lit the fuse
Death Row, my mother and father see
That I'm finna die but that really don't bother me
It don't matter that I'm young and ain't seen nothing
And all the shit I had in life don't mean nothing
""Oh say can you see,"" America beating the shit outta me

But they don't do it how we do it
So in order for you to qualify for your G card
You gotta be certified
Shoutout to Klondike Kat

We pulled up five deep in the dark Lincoln
Shut the party down like ya momma when she start drinking
I'm bare-hugging the game it ain't no getting lose
I'll leave ya sickle a gallon in a two-month old chitlin juice
If I aim I'm goin hit'cha
My shots are like ya wife when ya leave home for work I won't miss ya
Some of my actions ain't psychologically sensible
I'm invincible; my office is where they send the principal
Your girl is trippin dude and honestly you should check her
Cause right now she's on my woo-woo-woody woodpecker
You play with us ya leave and you'll be on the bus deceived
And when you see me you should apologize to me just for breathing
I put the game down heavy like Petey Wheatstraw
You're strong enough to flip a grown elephant off a see-saw
Bill your juices up to try me it goes to be in a hospital hooked on spiritual IV

I know they hate that we this live, cause we straight certified
Many tried and got they whole mind state murderlized
We was mashing out the gate and you was late to arrive
Like walking in a eight-O-clock meeting at eight thirty-five

Uh, I know they goin hate though
King of the ghetto what they call me I'm the new Nate Dogg
Disrespected with the media they just can't wait though
Not try'na spend it up I'm try'na make ya face break though
They mad at me cause I be shining that ho
I'm like cracked nails on the south board I'm grinding that ho
Signature ink linking through the check I'm signing that ho
And all these golf balls lil daddy, yeah the diamonds that low
I'm winning to die for mine
So if I catch you by yoself you better get quick up with'cha hind that I am with mine
Z-Ro is a rolling stone
And the day I make my handy might kick up and at least pussy is my new home
I'm feeling so Pimp C right now call me Ro Chad

In the strip club I become richer cause all I do is throw cash
 I'm a whip yo ass so fast


I tell em I am Kaza the stand that I'm certified
Worm sharper than the spikes of a porcupine
And I don't do too much talking I just hold the nines
Chiropractor bullets send em through em let em ark ya spine

A.R's, neck and lavish your life's a catastrophe
Back to the factory, running manufactory
Polo type, FDA's a proof satisfactory
Ammunition gang mothafucka with'cha guns hide
S.P.A. niggas south 
The school street fighting now I'm looking like Plunge guy

I Dare You, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Jump up in the ring with the god, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the god, I dare you
Do it, you kill yourself when you try to kill me
Jump up in the ring with the god, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the god, I dare you
You kill yourself when you try to kill me

When God knock you to the floor, ain't no counting
He wearing some boxing gloves that look like mountains
Showing you who he is, we right on the brink, black
You feel like you winning, He just letting you think that
See, the Devil is rebellious and defiant today
You think we care about what a stupid scientist say?
God planted the seed in me that I ride with any day
He don't need me fighting for Him but I try to anyway
He give you the blessing but you doubting him still
I can’t wait until the atheists find out that He real
You can still believe what you want, say what you feel
That’s the beauty of the God, he gave you free will
So what happens is they reject Him so we know what the pattern is
But since you laugh at Him, watch Him strangle you with your arrogance
Now you trapped in His big storm, hoping the rain ends
Feeble brain men fighting a battle that they can’t win

Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Do it, you kill yourself when you try to kill me
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
You kill yourself when you try to kill me

I go nowhere without the God, that’s my rule
I say a prayer before I make a move, that’s my fuel
Any book with true wisdom in it, that’s my tool
I go to the mosque for the teachings, that’s my school
I can’t speak for you or what other people do
But before you even use your mouth to slander Him, you need to think it through
Studying research ’til you understand it plain
People are trained to be afraid of what they can’t explain
From a lie that rejection was stemmed
It’s a fact that we’re a total reflection of Him
You got the nerve to deceive the people, hoping that we doubt
He conceived everything you breathe in and breathe out, fool
You doing what a wicked person would do
The truth is you don’t want us to stop worshipping you
But it’s over, this ain’t a movie, these storms are real
You getting killed, I don’t care how many bombs you build
So go ‘head

Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Do it, you kill yourself when you try to kill me
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
You kill yourself when you try to kill me

You tryna run us out of our own house
Biggest bully on the planet ‘bout to get stomped out
Don’t fall for the deception, the lying and tricking
Man plans and Allah plans who you picking
Wanna challenge who created you, now it’s too late for you
This ain’t the kind of fight that you can order on pay-per-view
A killer snowstorm or a massive earthquake or two
Drying up your lane and economically breaking you
So keep tracking us, stealing and jacking us
I talk a lot of smack because I know who’s backing us
It ain’t no saving you, your mind is gone
A law causes you to walk around with blinders on
His enemies don’t believe He’s inclined to fight
He just laying in the cut until it’s time to strike
You disregard His law ‘cause you feel you above it
But how come anytime you do us wrong, a town gets flooded?
So go ‘head

Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Do it, you kill yourself when you try to kill me
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
Your time is running out quick, feel me?
Jump up in the ring with the God, I dare you
You kill yourself when you try to kill me",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-dare-you-lyrics
Anything That Moves,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Yeah
Once again...
You have entered the zone of no return...
Close ya eyes...

Nobody wanted to challenge me when the time came
I cocked aim and blow the pictures out ya mind frame
I like to gash, strike a match, burn 'em fast
I studied and learned the blast back in that Turner class
Got a weapon that spits bass of sulfuric acid
No time for caskets 'cause the massacre's too massive
Duck when I lay a verse down (yeah)
They call my opponent's McGradys 'cause they never make it out the first round
I stay composed when the gun blows
I fix supposed to be notorious head honchos and put em in nun clothes
You can't conspire to retire me, remove me from society
No force to put it off you have to hire me's (me's)
I'm a science bred anaconda piranha
The snake head removal with the Osama persona
Provoking me and never been wise I know you want to
And like borrowing some draws there's somethings you just don't do

Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
I'm a dismantle his frame with every weapon I can use
Got tools that do it smooth no traces or clues
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
I'm a dismantle his frame with every weapon I can use
Got tools that do it smooth no traces or clues

When you keep trying to be hard in spite of my warnings
The results are never pretty like yo wife in the morning
You be acting all fragile and feminine I'm the gutta type
I love myself so much I was still me in another life (that's right)
At high noon I'm a hit'cha with the loudest boom
You still on the surface I'm out of space like a crowded room
I travel on an aircraft plus in my gauge
I don't cuss you out from the road I got sky range
Let me say that it ain't never wise to bother K (never)
I execute ya first born son on Father's Day
Disintegrate ya address and lack of love I have for you was never ending
So I guess I could care less
You want the mic, I can't pass it to a hater (uh)
A belt ain't big enough; I'll whoop ya ass with the equator
Slice at a fast pace like it's a neck slashing race
Plus I'm meaner than the lady in a check cashing place

Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
I'm a dismantle his frame with every weapon I can use
Got tools that do it smooth no traces or clues
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
I'm a dismantle his frame with every weapon I can use
Got tools that do it smooth no traces or clues

It's a stupid move to fool with me in any situation
That's like choosing a life sentence over one day of probation (fool)
I'm focused (yeah) I take him out the minute he blink
I be sipping on nuclear atomic energy drinks
The second I laid eyes on the mic is when the wall broke
And when the smoke cleared it revealed miles of more smoke
You fraud, you don't wanna face this mob
You went from being hard to working on a waitress job
Came around tryna get taught to flow and be dope
You wanna learn try this new song I'll show you the ropes
You vain rappers are main the actors
I'll zap ya to another world like making Mxyzptlk recite his name backwards
Me and you are like crust, but different ways I'll summit (uh-huh)
Me I'll stay around bread and you get cut off from it
I pass a Rodger happily
I got a twin who was magically born twenty-seven years after me

Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
I'm a dismantle his frame with every weapon I can use
Got tools that do it smooth no traces or clues
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves
Don't spare nobody kill anything that moves

Fuel to the Fire,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"Aight, y'all keep on doin' it, that's cool, it's cool, watch

They stalked and they haunted you (yeah), America
Couldn’t count the people that they killed if they wanted to
Massacre after massacre
Blowin’ up and gassin’ the poor nations, chemically attackin’ ya
War after war, gotta wipe out more
Dirty sh*t being planned behind White House doors
Now the gas has been lit, soon you gon’ have to submit
See I don’t think y’all understand that these bastards are sick
This fake American Dream y’all really need to dump
Who’d you rather get sh*tted on by, Hillary or Trump?
They’ll justify a lie without mentioning why
Everybody’s pissed off, racial tension is high
When we fight back, they horns will stick out fast
And get mad ‘cause we don’t laugh when they kick our ass
Everyday you in the streets tryna break our youth
You like to call truth hate because you hate the truth

Ferguson set it off, now let it burn
Baton Rouge upon fire, let it burn
Babylon  on fire, let it burn
 fire the wicked ones, them gonna learn
Dallas upon fire, let it burn
 upon fire, let it burn
North Carolina, we on fire, let it burn
 fire the wicked ones, them gonna learn

Since yo dumbass is so scared that ISIS gon’ strike
Blame your own damn country for givin’ ‘em life
It’s too much other shit to worry ‘bout whenever you’re black
The last thing on our mind is a terror attack
We gotta worry ‘bout gettin’ jacked by two mean cops
The prospect of gettin’ shot during a routine stop
Bein’ targeted and dropped in a system that’s rotten
Gettin’ dope planted on us, locked up and forgotten
Why choose from two snakes with the voltage of half
That’s like being asked if you wanna be shot or stabbed
A disadvantaged spot, everyday a brand new plot
If the devil will fight God, then what chance you got?
They created the world crisis, left millions lifeless
Attempted to steal the birthright of the righteous
You on borrowed time now, the world being eclipsed
You wanna live, keep Farrakhan’s name off your lips

Ferguson set it off, now let it burn
Baton Rouge upon fire, let it burn
Babylon  on fire, let it burn
 fire the wicked ones, them gonna learn
Dallas upon fire, let it burn
 upon fire, let it burn
North Carolina, we on fire, let it burn
 fire the wicked ones, them gonna learn

Set it ablaze
Babylon embedded in flames
Kept us as slaves, accelerated the end of your days
Setting the stage for the war of armageddon
Can’t find my weapon that’s gonna help ‘em to prevail against the Lord of Heaven
Warn a reverend about the ultimate disaster
Grab a  cadaver over the molten magma
The smoke’ll choke the pastor, he coughing up a lung
Chastised for the thousand lies that’s bouncing off his tongue
And now it has begun, and how do you plan to run
When the Lord cracks an atom and harness the energy of the sun?
 payload
Ignited a living volcano, mouth kill away low,  is fatal
But now exists the power shift, the gods equipped
To power-lift the populace in a lava pit that’s bottomless
And we riding in a , all the tricks and politics
And you’re riding on a rocket ship, speeding to the apocalypse
Drown in the abyss, pulled below by the undertow
If it’s one to fold  thunder roll through your bungalow
Then the trumpet blow and them other  darken the sky
And y’all realize, y’all finna fry, schools on fire

Last Pair of Drawz,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"If they never hated me before, you gonna hate me now

You see I think it's time to beat the preacher's ass
Cause he lied and said we free at last
If you mad you don't have to listen
Let's see how many riding with me after this one
On TV you a gangster with lots of loot
But you're fans don't know that you're a prostitute
""I'm a G, I'm a G"", man cut it out
You in the office bent over getting gutted out
Hye, you better not talk about them gay people
Or them wicked Jews and they evil
They don't care about your money or your fame
One anti-Semitic claim, they'll run your ass right out the game
Every week I see a different fool going out
A woman can't blow up unless they hoe her out
Phony homies tryna fake their position
I hate a roach and I ain't talking about the ones in the kitchen
Now listen

I'm about to tear my last pear of draws
I'm about to tear my last pear of draws
I'm about to tear my last pear of draws
I'm about to tear my last pear of draws
They gonna get you if you riding they gonna get you if you chilling
They gonna get you either way so you might as well kill em man

I'm still out here getting it man, that's the real shocker
Tryna get rich like  peel doctor
The politicians ain't no different, they still tripping
Passing dirty laws, having orgies, coke sniffing
I still blame the Bush family for the country sinking fast
Somebody need to run an iron across their wrinkly ass
Meanwhile the whole hood is afflicted
And a child support cheque is like a lottery ticket
Now your 2 year old son is booty popping, what's the root?
And his silly ass mama talking bout, ""Look he's so cute""
It's bad enough you got that kind of madness in your mind
But you want the world to see it so you post it online
And his dumbass daddy old as hell, still trappin'
If you would have been around him then it probably wouldn't have happened
Wannabee king of the city until you got caught
Now you in the jail cell calling the white man, ""Boss""


A lot's happened since the last time we spoke
Let me officially announce I went broke
What I'm hearing in the music is like something's polluted
We all messed up in the head, present company included
Some of these dudes got some ways that I just don't get
Married a stripper now you mad at her cause she won't quit
You were soft so you came off in your bread real quick
But she ain't ever viewed you as nothing but being a trick
All the people seem to care about is drugs and clothes
I asked my partner why he go to church, he said, ""For the hoes""
Anything goes in this sick world, whatever you're liking
Dope selling, car jacking, pill popping and dyking
Government for the lying ass pervert clowns
Coward cops will beat an handicapped man to the ground
You still tryna emigrate with these devilish hicks
America, the most racist country to ever exist",https://genius.com/K-rino-last-pair-of-drawz-lyrics
How Can I,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"*Lean Sippa repeatedly sings 'How can I' in the background just as K-Rino asks the same question*

How can I be righteous in a unrighteous hood
Where it seems like evil forces got more strength than good?
When I'm tryna push my way through the door just to survive
But the rest of the world is pushing me back from the other side?
How can I evolve and develop into completeness?
How long can I look strong when really I'm at my weakest?
When will I take responsibility as an advisor
And start helping my young G's instead of being a criticizer?
How can I keep smiling when inside I'm 'bout to break-up?
How many times will we get railroaded before we wake-up?
When every time I try to advance something is stopping me
Tryna break the same cycle of failure and mediocrity
How can I stay focused and keep on my game face
When no matter how hard I work I'm still sitting in the same place?
Make me understand how can my life not be stressful
When the people who pull stunts and do dirt is more successful?

Here I stand before the world, my inner thoughts exposed
I'm like a time bomb ticking, I'm about to explode
I'm still holding on tight, tryna stay on my post
No matter how you think you understand, you don't come close

Let me tell you about my struggles man, life is like a hard road
I remember Daddy used to tell me, ""Life is like a hard road""
Focus on what's important and lighten your cargo
And do all you can today and plan for tomorrow
And disappointment happens so just face the facts
You move up one space and get pushed two spaces back
I see the two-car garage and house on the seashore
But the road has potholes and a sign that says 'detour'
Every time I turn around, ain't nothin' but trouble, man
Then I try to turn around, it's nothing but struggle, man
Won't somebody tell me, how is it possible
Crossing the landmine field with barbedwire and obstacles
And everybody taking shots, snitch niggas faking out
Bullshit niggas live and OGs are taken out
So how can I make it, email me if y'all know
Now I know what Daddy means, life is like a hard road

Here I stand before the world, my inner thoughts exposed
I'm like a time bomb ticking, I'm about to explode
I'm still holding on tight, tryna stay on my post
No matter how you think you understand, you don't come close

Act they down and they sell you out, that's how most do ya
Sometimes it's easier to talk to strangers than those who close to ya
How can a girl ever trust a man and love one later
When every man she ever met mistreated her and betrayed her?
How can I leave a bad situation and overlook one
When the person you're in that situation with thinks it's a good one?
If I don't keep people around me, it's like problems stay on me
The more time I spend alone, they more they seem to weigh on me
I got people I gotta reach, bread I need to be making
And I don't eat swine, so I ain't bringing home no bacon
We gotta bring enough sum home to guarantee we eat
And try to shield our seeds from being victims of the street
My checks is coming late and I ain't finding that funny
And the month is always lasting longer than the money
Sometimes everyday conflict can trigger your doubt
Life is odyssey, it's your job to figure it out

Here I stand before the world, my inner thoughts exposed
I'm like a time bomb ticking, I'm about to explode
I'm still holding on tight, tryna stay on my post
No matter how you think you understand, you don't come close",https://genius.com/K-rino-how-can-i-lyrics
Look Around You,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"Open your eyes
See the world for what it really is

I gotta deal with this lying and perpetrating, stressing and straining
I succeed in procrastinating, point fingers and blaming
The temptation of women, lust, and the failure to fight it
Getting doors slammed in my face and still smiling despite it
Learning how to check my ego and accepting correction
The hope of accomplishment mixed with the fear of rejection
The struggle to make my own knowledge reach its eliteness
Wanna cry but holding back to show no signs of my weakness
The good and the evil that clash in constant defiance
That live inside of me joined in a unholy alliance
Supposed to be patnas who ain’t never down when you need ‘em
The thin line that sits between incarceration and freedom
The ways we praise things and disrespect one another
Showing more love to our cars than we show to each other
The deep spiritual famine that we rarely examine
Damaging thought mismanagement the hand of Satan’s programming

So look around you, put some knowledge into your dome
Stop making everybody else rich and go get your own
Quit stressing over the salt that individuals drop
Don’t be trippin’ when people talk about your trip when they stop
Look around you, put some knowledge into your dome
Stop making everybody else rich and go get your own
Quit stressing over the salt that individuals drop
Don’t be trippin’ when people talk about your trip when they stop

Against our own people, we quick to let cappin’ ensue
Don’t care about nobody’s problems ’til it happen to you
The genocidal antics, evil commandments that run rampant
The devilish pamphlets handed to man on every campus
Envious mental condition that lacks religion
The disproportional percentages of blacks in prison
You won’t show up for a protest, you’ll hide like cowards
But you’ll wait in line to see a concert for two hours
In our community, the Arabs and Chinese got stores
Getting rich off of your black dollar but fool, where yours?
Out here hustling, risking, doing time in the tank
Hundred and fifty dollar shoes on and not a dime in the bank
Some people you only see when they wanna borrow some paper
And then they come up missing when it’s time to return the favor
Matters if we roll legit, the profiling won’t cease
White people feel safe, we tense up when we see the police

So look around you, put some knowledge into your dome
Stop making everybody else rich and go get your own
Quit stressing over the salt that individuals drop
Don’t be trippin’ when people talk about your trip when they stop
Look around you, put some knowledge into your dome
Stop making everybody else rich and go get your own
Quit stressing over the salt that individuals drop
Don’t be trippin’ when people talk about your trip when they stop

Full scheming and back-dooring, talking but never showing
Tryna bring you down with ‘em ‘cause they ain’t got nothing going
Tryna poison your dreams with hate and manipulation
Blatant statements that  spirit-raping your motivation
Grew up never trusting and got accustomed to scuffling
Don’t let nobody tell you you’ll never amount to nothing
If invalid men with sinful intentions slander you endless
If you let words destroy you, then you was weak to begin with
Got problems, survive ‘em, quit judging others and guide ‘em
Need to stop looking at people and start looking inside ‘em
Why you crying over somebody that’s being untrue?
Stressing over a person who ain’t even thinking about you
We make seeds then we break up, our families ain’t building
How you gon’ let a judge decide what’s best for your children
Can you overcome and progress? That’s the true test
I avoid the stress and strap on my hater-proof vest

So look around you, put some knowledge into your dome
Stop making everybody else rich and go get your own
Quit stressing over the salt that individuals drop
Don’t be trippin’ when people talk about your trip when they stop
Look around you, put some knowledge into your dome
Stop making everybody else rich and go get your own
Quit stressing over the salt that individuals drop

I'll pack a tablet like it's a strap
I'll split my tounge in half and concurrently snap
On two different cats with two different raps
Think a second and picture that
Your spine will be so quickly snatched
Your sacroiliac will crack before it hits the mat
Not to deny that I'm a popular guy
See you can lease this ass kicking with an option to buy
To your weak innocuous try I'll never drop a reply
I'm so lofty and high, my house sits on top of the sky
Bars injected in your temple made your opticals fry
If they rush you to emergency the doctor would cry
Every line you ever spoke was a preposterous lie
We'll battle by the ocean loser gotta watch till it's dry
Are you noticing the load my folders shouldering
So much control woven into my notes
That my vocals could train a Doberman
I seek victims bind 'em and twist 'em
Blast the fragments out of your mind in an instant
Then force you to go find 'em and fix 'em

Garbage man of the game I'm the trash taker
Pen and pad chaser, bulletproof glass breaker
I never panic till I'm down to my last paper
They diagnose me with a bad case of Agg Nature

Picture my teeth with a spleen loving emcee in between
I'm so evil and mean that I'll smother a breathing machine
Bleed your cerebrum and free you from every reason to dream
Sweep thru the scene with white jeans on and leave with 'em clean The simple and senseless attempted to mimic my template
As I stand on no paper lines balancing like a gymnast
I mix lemon with 56 venoms
But when I'm really pissed I challenge rappers to pillow fights with bricks in 'em
I break time barrier planes that they don't know about mayne
I caught a 5 o'clock train before the 4 o'clock came
My tightest binge you might just spend your life deciphering
I come home every night at 10 and walk-in on my writing pens fighting again
I take humbrege when you throw them fake punches
Strengthen my tounge reflexes by dodging snake lunges Decapitation the moment my opponent bowed
I'm standing on it proud walkin thru the crowd
Shrouded in ammonia clouds

Garbage man of the game I'm the trash taker
Pen and pad chaser, bulletproof glass breaker
I never panic till I'm down to my last paper
They diagnose me with a bad case of Agg Nature

I was writing and over heated my mind
The whole room caught fire, but I wouldn't leave till I completed the line
I'll say a long page so crazy and aggravated that by the time you played it
All the way thru your youngest baby is graduated
Some think that I'm a boring guy they say I'm 6'4
But my thought supply measures at 1800 stories high
I'm standing taller than the Andes
With countless dialects that come in handy
So even the ants can understand me
I'll take to the sky in haste detonate ya entire base
My pet fish don't like the water they swim in the fireplace
Leave liars in dire straits cause I only admire greats
My titles are Formaldehyde laced, so come and try a taste
When the beat is on I do things I don't even condone
The voices in my head be begging me to leave them alone
It's known that once my targets selected no punches are miss directed
Every knuckle on my fist got another fist connected

Garbage man of the game I'm the trash taker
Pen and pad chaser, bulletproof glass breaker
I never panic till I'm down to my last paper

With My Own Eyes,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"I'ma let you know right now
These are not bedtime stories
Just a little somethin' somethin'
That ya boy been through
Check it

I was gettin' dressed to head to the mosque one Sunday
When the sound of two shots took that attention from me
I thought now maybe I'm mistaking the sound
Must've been a couple of two-by-fours hittin' the ground
When I walked out I found it was what it was seemin'
Heard the sound of other residents yellin' and screaming
People frantically running, everybody was scared
I'm like what happened? My neighbors started pointing up stairs
And somebody had got shot, the place was unsettled
Blood had ran down all the way to the ground level
The 911 lady said they was comin' soon
Told me get a towel and apply pressure to the wounds
So I ran upstairs not really knowin' what for
Had to squeeze in the house 'cause he was blockin' the door
Layin' face down, not moving, I touched him on the shoulder
When the paramedics got there it was already over, man

Just a few little thrown off things that I seen with my own eyes
(Seen with my own eyes)
Everything that I'm saying really happened
And I promise that it's no lie (Promise it ain't no lie)
Just a few little thrown off things that I seen with my own eyes
(Seen it with my own eyes, man)
Everything that I'm saying really happened
And I promise that it's no lie (Ha)

When I was young I had a friend named Jo-Jo my Ace
He used to say that he was born with a veil over his face
Didn't know that that meant, had no reason to doubt him
But there was always something paranormal about him
We used to watch karate movies, then put on our shoes
Go outside later on and try to copy the moves
He could do them all, somersaults, roundhouse kicks
He was clever and could do slick and magical tricks
One day he said he had a gift and would prove it in time
Told us he could make things move by using his mind
We all laughed and he said he would prove it's legit
He put a pencil half and half on a four foot brick
Stared at it for a minute as we gathered in tight
Shifted his hands and when he did the pencil moved to the right
We all went crazy said it was a trick or the wind
So he put his hands behind his back and did it again, man

Just a few little thrown off things that I seen with my own eyes
(Seen with my own eyes)
Everything that I'm saying really happened
And I promise that it's no lie (Promise it ain't no lie)
Just a few little thrown off things that I seen with my own eyes
(Seen it with my own eyes, man)
Everything that I'm saying really happened
And I promise that it's no lie (Ha)

One night when I came home from getting some food
My place sister was outside arguing with a dude
I was like it ain't my business so I walked on straight
But then the fussing got louder and started to escalate
Took the groceries to my door, put the bags on the ground
I came back in peace tryin' to calm homeboy down
He was still going off hard running his trap
He started talking crazy to me and that's when I snapped
Walked up on him, knock him out cold was the plan
About two seconds later the altercation began
Then he pulled out a pistol, he done probably got me
I grabbed the gun hand and turned it away from my body
Took my other arm and slammed him to the asphalt
When we hit the ground somehow the pistol went off
My sister screamed and L.V. ran out to help
I walked away 'cause the damn fool blasted himself

Just a few little thrown off things that I seen with my own eyes
(Seen with my own eyes)
Everything that I'm saying really happened
And I promise that it's no lie (Promise it ain't no lie)
Just a few little thrown off things that I seen with my own eyes
(Seen it with my own eyes, man)

Wreck Time,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"Hey get up! Wake up!
Y'all know what time it is
4 A.M. every day we do this man it's wreck time
Don't make me pull this rip out, get up!
Hey you in the corner, I see ya over there tryna hide, get up!
You didn't hide yesterday when you was pulling that same stunt
Line up! It's wreck time

I squeeze on 'em till the strap got a bloody maroon trigger
I don't pour salt on the wound, I just make the wound bigger
By means of verbal discipline, too many to list them
I liquefy, replace your bloodstream, then poison your system
The pain and suffering's perpetual, my mic cuts ya eye
I leave ya barely alive but not sick enough to die
Swoop down like a bird of pray then pick him up and fly
You could have the speed of thought, you ain't quick enough to try
When they talk about the greatest don't nobody ride with ya
Like a cameraman in a photo shoot, you ain't in the picture
If you better than me, I still wouldn't end by assault
I spit for years until you finally dive and win by default
My mic flow is like mixing in fire with nitroglycerin
So magnificent you burn metabolism just by listening
Carry out all of my schemes no matter the means
I'll beat your head in while you're sleeping just to shatter your dreams

It's wreck time, wreck time, tell em it's wreck time
Hard South Park rhymes severs ya neck line
It's wreck time, wreck time, better respect mine
Kill a south side rhymes, bust like a TEC-9

The more the pressure applied the harder you better strive
If you got tight metaphors then I must have metafives
The first opponent tried and now he don't even look alive
The second one did like a professional swimmer and took a dive
Before I can empty a verbal clip in 'em (What he do?)
He slit his own throat just to deny me the satisfaction of ripping him
I sing and leave you grip hard with a quick raw stream
Dangling with ya neck knotted inside a guitar string
I breathe into you, leak degrees of typhoid fever
You couldn't hide from me in a reproductive seed of an Amoeba
Challenge K-Rino, yeah you be a fool to pursuit this
Even ya own partners ask ya, ""Man, you sure you wanna do this?""
I spit artistic sickness, you drifted from the zone of the gifted
And got whipped because you rebelled like you was 
The most complex  scene, basic when I'm done
You undefeated bringing 0, watch me replace it with a one

It's wreck time, wreck time, tell em it's wreck time
Hard South Park rhymes severs ya neck line
It's wreck time, wreck time, better respect mine
Kill a south side rhymes, bust like a TEC-9

The sword fighter, the general with cynical material
No milk I use biohazardous chemicals in my cereal
Actually you gotta spontaneously combust to flatter me
You shorten bars up like a cell phone with a low battery
I shine until I blind you like potent reflectors
My rapid moving vocals are picked up by motion detectors
I'm the depth broker, the heartless antagonistic provoker
The transcender of all spirits, the hologram choker
I pin novels and hyperbaric bulletproof fiberglass
And somehow physically kill a rapper, through a cyber cast
You couldn't rise higher than me on a track
If you was on a trampoline in space and I had a mountain strapped to my back
The messianic figure of rap and can't nobody stop 'em
K-Rino could be an unclosed bottle you couldn't top me
I execrate ya throat and leave my opponents with asthma
Forget money, let's battle for organs and blood plasma

It's wreck time, wreck time, tell em it's wreck time
Hard South Park rhymes severs ya neck line
It's wreck time, wreck time, better respect mine
Kill a south side rhymes, bust like a TEC-9",https://genius.com/K-rino-wreck-time-lyrics
Panoramic,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"Workout time again
On Point Studio
We just up in here, me and Snipe, man
We gon’ workout a little bit, for this Makin’ Enemies project
Spit some rhymes for my homies and like that kind of stuff

I’m puttin’ panoramic cameras out so I can scan and scout
The planet and channel out the man endowed in me and his spouse
I live in a ceramic house that I damage substantially when I’m spoutin’ high powered showers of sledge hammers out
My anger and manic bouts are tantamount
I can’t account nothing prior to me
Landing here via Trans-Atlantic route
A man of clout yet my sanity stands in doubt
‘cause I ran throughout the land, feeding ferocious animals hand-to-mouth
Powerful numbers left these cowards to wonder
Calendar date scrambler, New Year’s is now in the summer
I’m in the big leagues, you diss me and I’ma blitz you with quick speed
And rip you like that pissed tiger did the partner of Siegfried
See you don’t want it with none of us
I’ma bust ’til the contents of your stomach’s crushed and lookin’ just like sonic slush
Impossible shots I hit
Five mic passes equal five assists when I get hot as Peja Stojaković
Yeah, hand me that water, man
Like I say we just in here working out
Puttin’ a little something together, man
K-Rino, Big Snipe in the building, man
Let me load up with this second verse real quick, y’all
Watch

I practice stomping out weak circles
And fifty pound ankle weights leaping vertical over five feet hurdles
See me defying logic, that’s a easy one
Picture AR-15 rifle bullets releasing from a BB gun
And when these weapons emerge, you’ll understand I’m better with words
Swatting your head like a Federer serve
You’re flatulent and dense so I’ve been coming at you since
I can fake throwing a jab and make a statue flinch
When I’m running it, no one can accomplish it
I’m the wondrous flame that keeps becoming lit with no candlestick under it
There’s no chance of imagining or matching my acumen
For tapping into deep areas average men ain’t rappin’ in
Verses be worded thoroughly, it might take an eternity
To interpret and determine literal from hyperbole
After these third degree burns that he first received he learned to be courteous
Still I imperviously charged him a service fee, whoo
Now I’m tryna figure out what I’ma eat tonight
All this rappin’ made me hungry, man
Gotta get some nourishment in my body
‘cause if I collapse on the mic, won’t be no third verse
But I’m just playin’, here it go, check it

Enlist artillery in my facility
The skill in me makes building something silly really a mental impossibility
I will agree to kill a spots 
I’m fast and agile so call me by my new name, Veloci-gility
The streets lookin’, that’s why I keep pushin’
Don’t need a bat, I had a blood skeetin’ and gushin’ from beatin’ you with a seat cushion
Completely still yet I steady creep
Lyrical anesthesia settles deep so you pass out while you already ‘sleep
Kill again when big hand meets little hand
Catch you standing in between two other dudes and eliminate the middle man
You cats is playin’, you oughta be ashamed for this
For falling out the game as quick and decades later I remain this dangerous
I blink my eyes and I’m energized
A hundred percent of me flies out even when I only give twenty-five
Climbing the highest stairway
Smoke mics like cigarettes and mash ‘em out in a cat’s face like it’s an ashtray
Like it’s an ashtray, haha
Boys be asking me a lot of questions, mane
Some I be wanna answer, some I don’t be wanna answer
But I will say this
I love spittin’ these lyrics for y’all
And I’ll leave it at that
Let’s go home",https://genius.com/K-rino-panoramic-lyrics
Ready to Ride,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"4, 3, 2, 1, ah!
Where my keys at?
Let's go all the way in

I'm the breeder of much needed magnificent readings
I make it rain by throwing loose change the strippers be bleeding
Got the full intelligence of 22 grown men
You can mute me and I'm still louder than you on ten
You couldn't bump me off with ten rifles
You in the final stage of being washed up I guess that means you in the spin cycle
Don't ever ask me if I'm ready man I'm clearly down
My demeanour so agg that you can hear me frown
These rappers wanna knock me off feet
But I'm taking em out every night before I sleep like they was false teeth
I'm lyrically wild, I thought that I was senile
Cause I got a different number every time that I hit redial
Riding down your street trashing the beat
I'm one deep driving the car from the passenger seat
See I don't play, I'm all about biz
I eat hundred dollar bills cause I like to put my money where my mouth is

I'm ready to ride
(All you sucker cover sissies tryna rap)
Don't make me ride
(The word mercenary gotta stay strapped)
No you can't hide
(Swinging on em with a Superman slap)
Don't make me ride
(The word mercenary gotta stay strapped)
Ah Ha!

Last of all you ain't worth discussing
Normally I start by saying 'first of all' but I can't see you being first at nothing
Build the vocal monument then put my book in it
My verses are hot enough to smoke you till you look tinted
I'm seeking war with you, a quick loss is calling you
I sleep on watered down toilet paper sheets without falling through
I searched through the daylight until I found night
I sink my teeth into the beat, call it a sound bite
An underwater fortress is where I record this
I don't use the mic, I rap into the blade of a swordfish
Once and for all I making negative respondents fall
Phone battle holocaust ten thousand rapper conference call
Flammable tongue mass with a lightening effect
I could have two left feet and still kick you RIGHT in your neck
Schooling you is what I beautifully do
I'll blackout and then record so when I hear my songs they new to me too


You harmless as a daffodil, I attack and kill
I'm in the mood for fast food I want a 7-piece wack rapper meal
When I get adamant they tell me that I have to chill
Assassin lyrical the is K-Rino, backwards skill
You can't prevail cause you fraud on the large scale
Like a homeless chap claiming he having a garage sale
For years straight I'm moving at a great rate
You at the crib working out with a shake weight
You faking tough get ya vocal communication up
We was talking face to face and he was breaking up
Don't need blunts to complete verbal elite stunts
My calandar got 365 days in each month
I'll race through time and space like a TV chase
Every two-thousand units I pop out of the CD case
I'm the underground hydrochloric acid fire
Quieten baby rappers with hundred pound pacifiers",https://genius.com/K-rino-ready-to-ride-lyrics
Spit Sumthin,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"I stay focused, life’s all about balance
Success breeds  ‘cause God gave me this talent
I never rode the bench, I always been a starter
And overtime gon’ cost you more than four quarters
Big mouths I slap shut and slap nuts I vanquish
Flap them lips too much you’ll leave using sign language
Call me king ‘cause I wreck ‘em, polish ‘em with my septum
Trap ‘em when I catch ‘em, put motion sensors in they rectum
And then I send ‘em through so they can roam the blue
And you bet not call the police ‘cause every step you take I’ll be watching you
I’ll be watching you, I swear every step you take I’ll be watching you

Sick militant flow,  like a carbine
Explicit with the lyrics, watch me blow like a time bomb
Soldier of fortune, no time for the outcome
SPC, where the hell Sniper come from?
H-Town, baby, no love for you busters
Regime too raw, that’s why they don’t love us
The Mexican patna reppin’ SPC
Nobody in the game doing it like me
I’m surrounded by history, a legend in the making
K-Rino said homie that it’s mine for the taking
Can’t mess with the warriors, I’m bringing the pain
Snipe with the beast, militant mind-frame

Rapper K is the answer to the question of who is it
Got the call from the , flip my tongue like a lizard
Had no choice but to react when I first heard this track
Started jottin’ down lines in the back of the Lac
Contemplating to myself, now where should I begin?
I’m headed to the lab, my phone rings, it’s K again
Said, “I’m giving you a heads-up, you better bring your A-game
‘cause GT just killed it and Sniper wasn’t playin’
I arrived at the lab and heard this sh*t, he wasn’t frontin’
Now I’m standing at the mic, I’m ‘bout to spit something
I’m ‘bout to shine, ‘bout to go for mine
I only got twelve lines, ah sh*t, I’m outta time

Cool game, 
Not only hood, they internationally know my name
Cl’ Che but you can call me Ms West
The only rap chick in South Park in the library history chest
SPC, SUC, you can run across me, legendary emcee
Every word in my lyrics done paid dues
Google me, baby, under the keyword “She’s a ”
They hittin’ me from Germany saying, “Cl’ Che’s cool”
They can’t speak English but they rappin’ every word I put in Pro Tools
Spit something or just repeat this, “She’s a  little mama and she’s a bad chick

Just as is Anakin Skywalker before transforming to Darth Vader
My pen takes the form of a lightsaber
We touching the paper, my thoughts condense from vapors
My neighbors savor the flavor like babies pacing in front of a pit filled with alligators
When calibrating my brain, can’t remain unanimated
I allocated a heavy dose of pain, it’s navigated
Straight to your mainframe through the main vein
You strain in vain to maintain but can’t contain
The flame the God rained down with love for Abel but disdain for Cain
Who he labeled a murderer of his brother, which was unstable and deranged
But now we gang-bang and slang ‘caine

I’m a South Park assassin that’s sicker than straw fakers
Walk-ins are , take upon all takers
 God bless you and your mama
When f*ckin’ with Murder, you end up with multiple head trauma
I talk the talk, walk the walk
So ease on down the road  end up in chalk
I have no preference who I devour, man
Me with a hundred round clip make it easy to shower man
Now whoever thought Murder One was a rowdy man
A everyday cat that runs with a rowdy clan
South Park Coalition is the name of this rowdy band
Murder One  and I’m outie man

I spot moon rocks with my optics
Got subatomic harpoons and deadly monsoons in my pocket
I pause and start morphing
Inner body experience where I enter your body and crush organs
I think 'til the floor spins
I'm still bombing after the war ends, endorphins so strong they make swords bend
Live and execute a rough lyrics prolific shooter
In the womb receiving visions from my physics tutor
Once the beat ignites, no more MCs in sight
I'm from a planet where midgets are seven feet in height
I don't let cowards speak plus my powers deep
Work for nine years in a row and recharge on a hour's sleep

Officer Cartwheel, officer Cooper
Tuck your tails in when you see us on street, if not, we shoot ya
On your way to hell ‘cause heaven you never made it
Walk around in your shell ‘cause your soul’s been desecrated
Don’t slouch, keep my pistol in perfect pouch
Hit you when you in your Snuggie, sittin’ on your curvy couch
Rhymes blow up, scar you in legions
Twisted metal travels to equatorial regions
Retaliation got a lot of remedies
One by one your family members erased like Kennedys
I’m a rapper slash producer slash terrorist
Slash illuminati grow from ear to ear, I’m the scariest

Out a playa know his mama planted the truth in me
And grew up so big ’til it popped, now it’s loose in me
Mind frame brain ain’t the same that it used to be
I rather live life than chase women and jewelry
Spit game came with a heavenly layer
 beware,  be everywhere
It ain’t no playin’ with you, busters, I will shoot in the air
But instead of spittin’ some bullets, I’ma spit you a prayer
Dear God, let ‘em ride, give ‘em where to survive
Leave ’em alive, even if he wishing I died
And dear God, let ‘em ride even if we collide
‘cause I know even when I’m wrong, I want you on my side
And that’s 

Spittin’ at you fools, 
Kick down doors, go and stage 
Seek the truth, gain self-knowledge
Educate yourself, as well as go college
Spit from the mind, spit to the beat
Spit from the heart, spit for those raised on the streets
Words transcribe onto paper without thinking
Some think they’re on top but I see ‘em sinking
I’m a spitter, old school tagger
Flows still sharp like a sharpened dagger
Climb the ladder from the gutter to the stage
Now I spit something just to earn my wage

It’s the return of 
Class of ’89, bloodline SPC
I’m a lyrical train-wreck, spot-rocker, 

Slam dunk kind of flow
Shattered the glass in South Park but I was on the court in Tokyo
Half man, half silverback
Half of my opponent hanging out my mouth
I got an anaconda’s digestive tract
Assassin’s Creed  hard when I spit
But  so hard  and jumped on my d*ck
 rare breed of the SPC seed
 signing out live from , yo

Uh, full block say goodbye when I spit something
That’s for ni**as left , we burn and get to dumpin’
That’s for ni**as thinking they chick won’t leave ‘cause a ni**a rich
But when , she got hooked on the bigger fish
I’m like the old school Wu, all about cream
Getting to the  been like sippin’ on lean
Gotta spit something, bringing out the  team
Got enough drive for two and a half men, call me Charlie Green
I’m in the streets with that thing, I gotta get it right
You can dodge for so long like Eddie, my chopper Scary Spice
I leave the  like a college grad 
What I spit, ni**as catching bullets like a young Jerry Rice

Point Blank, the Southside OG
They know the real so they still keep they eyes on me
You might not see me on BET or things of that nature
Can’t get no play when ni**as at the radio station hate ya
One thing they can’t take from me is the streets
A lot of these pussies can’t be found in the streets
Yeah, like  I’m all over
Call me AI when I hit the state-line and I crossover
I represent Texas like Vince, a boss like Prince, you can check my prints
You might see me in the club with some Lords and Bloods
Got a sherm flow motherf*ckin’ enjoy the drugs
Wanna get high with the Blankster? F*ck that
The door closed, all you b*tch ni**as and you fake h*es
South Park Coalition, that’s us
Remember that when you start talkin’ ‘bout Houston and don’t mention us

I’m suffering, my heart is in pain
I’m a madman ‘cause the whole world is insane
I read scriptures ‘cause decisions come too hard
Money, cash, currency — which is our true god?
Good or bad, right or wrong, life’s a seesaw
Sometimes the straight and narrow path has a detour
My mind clicks like a snare with a mob kick
Ideas spark like a high hat constant
The city breeze, the streets are a part of me
Danger don’t bother me, there’s ice water in my arteries
I mean-mug a alligator like he did something
Stared a cobra eye to eye, dared him to spit something

 spit hot lava disperse
Rough like  tryna quench a thirst
Must release a verse among the first
Clicked up fools puttin’ up in a hearse
Pressure bust pipes where the sh*t done burst
These fools right here are the worst
Claim your turf, we claim the earth
Hardest clique b*tch from the birth
Only curse is spittin’ the truth
Call the laws when in the booth
Soft ass h*es pray to live
This track missing one thing, AC Chill

Ni**as always ask me why I kick this psycho sh*t
I got a axe with ten blades that I might go get
If I explain it to you, ni**a, then you will get hit
Tell your mama it’s a black dress she needs to go get
When it sticks in, that motherf*cker makes me proud
Spray blood so thick and far it looks like a cloud
And I love ‘em so much that I named all ten
But I won’t say they names ’til they all go in and come out
The brains left  for stains
And that’s the reason why I gave ‘em ten different names
Like Becky, Robert, Kevin, Michael and Drew
Keisha, , K-Rino, you name the last two uh

It all started
In the kitchen with a mission, tryna beat the competition
Treat it like a job so I can retire with a pension
Hit the block with a , four oz’s in my pocket
I’m outta control, you just can’t stop me
J. Water in this b*tch and I’m spittin’ on the mic
And I promise that I can do it all night
Yeah motherf*ckin’ ni**as, SPC
When you lookin’ for that white girl, come see me
I’m a beast in these streets, monster in this motherf*ckin’ game
When they call me, I let them bullets rain
No matter the consequences, I’m still here
Sippin’ syrup, smoking’ herb in the atmosphere, yeah, hahh

I politick when it come to spit these rhymes
Boy talkin’ about my rep, man, ‘cause they ain’t got a style like mine
I’m the new generation, I got the remedy to rep
No disabilities, only the ability to snap
I'll take words and abstract, you can call me analyst
Boy talkin’ ‘bout they gon’ run when they peters can’t even spit sh*t
Ni**as like the way I rip this, my tongue I flip it
Yeah they like the way I spit it

See, how many times have we done this, man?
How many clique songs have you heard over the years from the South Park Coalition?
All the way down, slipped into a coma murder script
Name on a bullet, the original South Park Coalition
This what we do, man
So all the rappers around the world, y’all keep on makin’ y’all clique songs, man
Let’s keep this thing going, we can keep throwing
Keepin’ that work in, mash on these tricks, yeah, haha, that’s it, it ain’t enough room in this booth for all us",https://genius.com/K-rino-spit-sumthin-lyrics
Thought Drones,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"Yeah, watch as I magically take a trap beat and pile MC bodies on the scrap heap

Understand I didn’t come here to debate you
I came to run a saber straight through your rib cage, poke a lung then deflate you
By saying this, you might think that I hate you
But if you knew the way I slew the last 28 dudes, you’d be grateful
I’ll show the children how I wrote a million, unloaded skill
Then made his frame collapse straight down like an imploded building
My raw skills cause you to need heart pills
Your thoughts are far from real like sawing off all your limbs and doing a cartwheel
My mode shifts, I step hard ’til the road splits
Drove to the summer solstice with a whole army of ghosts clenched in my closed fist
Might clown around with a roundhouse counter-style from a mounted file
Plus every time I do a pushup the earth goes down a mile
The atoms race through dark matter space
They calibrate every bar that I make while coordinating my database
My set of rules is never contestable
Able to view the next 200 decades ahead of you through my spectacles
My talents leak out by the gallons
I walk skyscrapers at night as a challenge while sleeping still keeping my balance
I’m hard to drop like a bad habit
Leave two of my tablets in a room alone, they’ll produce songs faster than jackrabbits
I’m ruling men with a fast moving pen
I used to be cool with the Super Friends until I became one of Lex Luthor’s men
Ruthless when I’m mad my front tooth extends
I was the hooligan in the new suit fashion from cougar skin
I’m the true decider, deep as a scuba diver
Of 10,000 arrivers, only two survivors, just me and my Uber driver
Mysterious plowers put fear in a coward
I can shave my face and grow a full beard in a hour
Ain’t no nappin’ when these thoughts are travelin’
It’s sounding like a cavalry with 20,000 horses galloping
I got no time for restin’ and grapplin’
All that’s happening is rappers’ next of kin gettin’ visited by the chaplain
When I create at my normal rate, concepts congregate
Down in my conscious state and songs take seconds to formulate
Every day is tough, I rip thousands of sheets of paper up
For every line I say, it’s a hundred that didn’t make the cut
Not too genteel to leave men killed
Super vision instilled because my contact lenses resemble windshields
My concentration’s never been greater
I’m composing ten papers on a freezing thin glacier without a windbreaker
Squeeze the life from whoever speaks of me
Each race, color and creed I see, I don’t discriminate, I leak ‘em equally
It’s not in me to weep and be timid
My vehicle I’m sleepin’ in, even when it goes a hundred over the speed limit
At the age of two, they knew I was a crazy dude
My vapors move through trachea tubes and chew organs ’til they mushy as baby food
My skill roots are hard to trace, my thoughts move faster than cars that race
Even when I’m thinking at a jogger’s pace
I move about with no way of screening me
Whether land, water or greenery, I can easily blend into the scenery
My dumb foes evacuate when I unload
They run so rapidly when I compose, their feet sound like a drum roll
I’m like Flash so when I slash ya
If you call 911, I’ll be the cat that answers posing as the dispatcher
So no one’s coming to provide protection
Many personalities, when I look in the mirror I see five reflections
They started questioning my mental health
Meanwhile I was in a belt of clouds, Facetiming my 60 year old self
Undressing you with the naked truth, after I wreck a crew
Detectives test my mic hand for gunshot residue
Circle you like an Andean condor
Then I spun your house around until your backyard was sitting at your front door
Defying physics ’til the class learns
K-Rino inventor of the 360 degree half turn
No saving me because I’m too disturbed
Shell casings falling out my mouth as I aim at rappers and shoot my words",https://genius.com/K-rino-thought-drones-lyrics
Real Out Here,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"Man, things ain't changed out here, just different people occupyin’ the same spots, meanwhile, people sittin' in them high seats, not seemin' to care, c’mon

Listen it's real out here, nothing becoming easy
What's the deal out here, people be acting greazy
Been a long while since we had a good hot dinner
We chasin' money but that money went as fast as a sprinter
It's gettin' wild in these streets, they say that we crazy
But y'all the ones building the prisons to lock up our babies
Tough to get ahead when somebody's pressing us back
You created the ghetto, man, how you expect us to act?
He got a pistol on him plus in his truck a machine gun
Hard to learn to be a man if I never seen one
Daddy locked up, yeah, they sent them people to get him
Now it won’t be long ’til his son is in there with him
No groceries in the house so he out here prowlin'
How I’ma concentrate in class if my stomach is growlin'?
No strategy, waitin' for the problems to pass
Hard to play outside around broken bottles and glass, listen

It's real out here
What’chu know about it?
I said it's real out here
Y'all ain't livin' this
Y'all don't care ‘bout how we feel out here
Never have, never will
All these years and we still out here
Still out here, c'mon

Plot and plan when the sun's out and move at night
They got dropped in this grease, they ain't choose this life
Hard as hell tryna make a way beyond odds
You see thugs when you look at ‘em, I see young gods
You see criminals and drug dealers headed for jail
I see poor people tryna fight they way out of hell
Dirty projects full of roaches, maybe some rats
You know how hard it is tryna raise a baby in that?
Any hopes, any dreams get canceled fast
Y'all mad ‘cause baby girl flippin' stamps for cash
You say they hustlin' the system to produce a 
But y'all complaining ‘bout a situation you created
Enemies necessary to obtain some loot
Dice game on the court, kids can't even hoop
It ain't nothin' to hear some gunshots flyin' around
Picture a five year old seein' a dead guy on the ground
Watch it

It's real out here
What'chu know about it?
I said it's real out here
Y'all ain't livin' this
Y'all don't care ‘bout how we feel out here
Never have, never will
All these years and we still out here
Still out here, c'mon

Stress on the mind, ain't too many beautiful times
Twenty-nine cars ridin' in the funeral line
Mama's packed in the county tryna see loved ones
Broken hearted parents burying they teenage son
Over nonsense somebody we know gets killed
And if the streets don't get you then the police will
Catching cases on a daily basis, stressed with life
CPS snatching our children left and right
Hood fights every night, tension live on stage
Opioids in the hood now, this ain't no phase
Never had nothing so he pullin' moves and stunts
‘cause he wanted to have some name-brand shoes just once
And half the school teachers talkin' out the side of they neck
They don't care about the children, they just gettin' a check
And most people that can help us be turnin' they back
Until you see it in your neighborhood, then you react, listen

It's real out here
What'chu know about it?
I said it's real out here
Y'all ain't livin' this
Y'all don't care ‘bout how we feel out here
Never have, never will
All these years and we still out here
Still out here, c'mon",https://genius.com/K-rino-real-out-here-lyrics
Homeboys,The Hit List,2004.0,"Yeah, what's up?
We gon' talk about friends, you know what I'm saying?
If you been dealing with this, we gon' try to win this thing
Everybody goes through struggles, you know what I'm saying?
But uh it's how you deal with it that proves if you a real partner or not
So I'ma lay out a few examples, let y'all know how it go

Is you my homeboy or is you bumping your gums?
Would you stay down 'til we come up or sellout over crumbs?
When it's time to go to war and y'all about to get jumped
Would you stand there with him toe to toe or run like a punk?
If your partner went to jail and had to do about eight
Would you carry the weight and make sure that his family was straight?
If y'all came up on a lick so cool, the Feds couldn't stop it
Would you fake him out or keep it real and split up the profit?
If I make a move and win, would you study my lesson
Or would you start stressing, throwing salt and cursing my blessing?
You could chunk your partner one grand, you might give him two
But when you get down and he come up, would he do it for you?
If you meet a fine woman but she likin' ya friend
Are you the type to player hate or would you put ya boy in?
If you buddy's girlfriend was tryna give you some play
Would you pass up on that chance or would you smash that day?

Are you my homeboy or is you out to get me?
Yeah, you talking hot shit but are you really down with me?
Smiling in my face, walking round big chested
All that hard talk is sounding real good 'til you're tested
Yeah, you say on my team
All the while I get the vibe that you really tryna scheme
Some keep it real, some players straight bumping
Time will tell on a fraud, if it's real show me something

If I was out there pulling moves, gettin' way out of line
Would you check your boy and get him straight or let me run blind?
Keep in mind conditions cause folks to change over time
What you looking for might be something you don't wanna find
You can always name a couple that was real from the start
But after a while start developing some plex in their heart
If it was somethin real throwed off concerning your friend
Would you sit him down and let him know or just hold it in?
Envy coming from within, that's how it all begins
On the cool you loving when I lose and hating when I win
I'm knowing only a few gonna respect this shit
But I spit it 'cause I mentally detect this shit
I dissect fakers who front and try to check my shit
Analyze the situation and perfect my shit
If I got a new car would you smile when you inspect my shit
Or in your mind would you be hoping that I wreck my shit?

Are you my homeboy or is you out to get me?
Yeah, you talk that hot shit but are you really down with me?
Smiling in my face, walking round big chested
All that hard talk is sounding real good 'til you're tested
Yeah, you say on my team
All the while I get the vibe that you really tryna scheme
Some keep it real, some players straight bumping
Time will tell on a fraud, if it's real show me something

Never selling your boys out and coming through in the clutch
Splitting what you got with your partner even when it ain't that much
Caught up in some deep heat but still you don't dessert him
Telling him something real even when the truth gon' hurt him
Quick to help a friend without capping about what you gave
Keeping everything in the family and take his secrets to the grave
No roof over his head, you let him chill out at your place
Never say nothing behind his back you won't say to his face
Giving up the game now it's passed along to you
Reading all the snakes, haters and cakes up out the crew
The police looking for him and you hide 'em in the cut
'Cause real partners never let no drama split 'em up for real

Yeah, K-rino keeping it real
We all we got, you know what I'm saying?
Us and God so we gotta stick together out here, ain't no love
So we gotta love each other you feel me?

Are you my homeboy or is you out to get me?
Yeah, you talk that hot shit but are you really down with me?
Smiling in my face, walking round big chested
All that hard talk is sounding real good 'til you're tested
Yeah, you say on my team
All the while I get the vibe that you really tryna scheme
Some keep it real, some players straight bumping
Time will tell on a fraud, if it's real show me something",https://genius.com/K-rino-homeboys-lyrics
Is This You,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"Is this you, you cowardly punk
Let your gums bump then ran and got your homeboys jump
Did u steal a automobile somebody else had
And when someone got you for it, had a nerve to get mad
Do you borrow people's stuff and walk it through your doors
And keep it so long you start thinking it's yours
For days and for weeks and for months in fact
Then you get a attitude when they ask for it back
Is this you, in the brand new clothes
While your baby's in a diaper with some crusted up snot in his nose
Did you set a bad example to corrupt your seed
Teaching your little daughter how to roll your weed
Is this you, a straight G in the daylight
But at night you a undercover transvestite
That ain't right, females for services they will trade
Layin' up with dudes to get your cellphone bill paid
Is this you, livin' to hustle and do dirt
Four cars in you front-yard and none of 'em work
Is this you girl, pullin' groupie moves you don't have to
Backstage tryna have sex with the rapper
Is this you with your triflin' ass
Your partna gave you a ride across town and you ain't give him no gas
Would you rather go steal and rob
Or lay around the house and get high instead of finding a job
Are you the female who won't stand on her own two
Filed child-support 'cause baby-daddy didn't want you
Say dude, do you chase cheap thrills
Blowing you check at the strip-club instead of paying your bills
Let me know if I'm dissecting you wrong
Taking care of three kids that ain't yours but neglecting your own
Is this you, your underarms kicking like karate
Got four different dudes' names tatted on your body

(Hey) Is this you, dirty and low down and wicked
Sold your baby's toys for some concert tickets
Are you weak, are you sick, are you crazy, are you blind?
How the hell you gettin' bullied online and you're twenty-nine
Do you think you're still young and cute
Pot-belly and stretch-marks tryna do a nude photo-shoot
Do you walk around ignant and proud
Ain't got no class, comin' in quiet rooms talking out loud
Is you attitude and cheap ways just getting worse
Sneaking out before they take up the collection at church
Is this you, speaking on subjects you don't know
Are you the one who beat your children in the grocery store
Hey girl, do you roast to get whatever you can find
Do you shave you real eyebrows and draw black lines
Would you keep it real and tell me what I'm saying is true
Or do you act like nothing that I said applies to you",https://genius.com/K-rino-is-this-you-lyrics
Take Yo Mind,The Other Side (Mixtape),2008,"I rap back reaching the past, and snatch actual facts
Automatically manufacturing unspeakable acts
I'm a lyrical blunt, everybody's taking a drag
Plus I'm the only man that carries a earthquake in a bag
Rappers suffer the pain, my mic cause a jugular vain
They did surgery on my right knee and discovered a brain
I can see you without looking and hear you without listening
Kill you without touching you, organs and limbs missing
I was a seven-foot embryo, defying all logic
I don't grow I shrink, when I'm ninety-five I'll be microscopic
I make participles dangle, you hang when I strangle
My prophecies complex like isosceles triangles
My scholastic theses are masterpieces
That leads to tropical spastic paraparesis
I manhandle the intangible, I drop annual rap instruction manuals
You don't make sense like a vegetarian cannibal

I want you to understand
(Yeah, understand boy)
That I came to take your mind
(It's my brain, ain't nothing you can do fool, feel it)
I want you to understand
(It belong to me)
That I came to take your mind
(Ain't nothing you can do homie, raise up off it, come here)

Me fraudulent? Please, I'm sabotaging MCs
Become one with the oxygen, camouflaged in the breeze
I got people locked in a secret spot on my abstract thought
But the deeper plot will drop verses that will tamper with the equinox
Verses I send bring earth to a end
Impregnated my girlfriend, she gave birth to a pen
Two-thousand and four and I'm still housing your crew
When will I lose, say it to you backwards (four-thousand and two)
They locked me up with a thousand books, it didn't suffice
I came out two hours later, had read all of them twice
I'm a vessel of skill, I might launch a missile at will
My DNA stands for Don't Need A pistol to kill
Do you believe in alien abduction, is it a stunt?
Well I do, hell, I abducted three or four last month
Roll up in a tinted black car screaming ""Allah Akbar""


I dissect anatomies and leave them scattered in clinics
I go get them and reassemble them in a matter of minutes
A spectacular finish reenacted with accurate penance
Multiple lyrical combinations packed in a sentence
Every moment precise, I like to pull my chrome in a heist
Put your dome in some ice and insert a small homing device
You can't leak with these deep idiosyncrasies
Boy I drink degrees so everytime I think you freeze
It's the lyrical surge, the mental and physical merge
You see a blank page but I'm seeing invisible words
My black book travels alone, people think it's alive
I do shows, sometimes it's at the club before I arrive
The degenerate that diminishes winning percentages
My road trips consist of interplanetary scrimmages
A K-Rino clone ain't something that I'm tryna condone
I'm indescribable, my mind got a mind of its own",https://genius.com/K-rino-take-yo-mind-lyrics
Last Letter,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
High as a muthafucka now I feel better

Hey it's subliminal
Lyrical killer I'm Senekal
Out of my mind it's sort of bitch is a criminal
I'm so better thinking my private
I murder rappers like addictions to survive in the ghetto
Emergence from the catago my mind in the zone
Quick descriptions carry weight like they invading stones
Intoxicated by the music beat it's getting me high
Spittin' words like interventions as I'm closing my eyes
Nowadays rappers fake they ain't making no sense
Sniper Lenno throwing up the definition of sick
With no surprise no deny the kid is playing with fire
Picks emotion with these haters they be living a lie
Acknowledge when you see me they calling me the truth
Imprisoned to the booth so I spit it for the youth
A rebel without a cause I'll die for the glory
Harrow clinic images will tell the whole story

I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
Slanging to me nigga you ain't no enemy
Murder these rappers is what the beast that he telling me
I'm alone contemplating writing my last letter
A pen and a pad makes me feel better

I sit at home meditating to session my situation
One deep concentrating in total isolation
Thinking of my enemies my heart starts racing
Easily penetrating through all the hate and I'm facing
I wrote a long letter to myself and proceeded
To tear it up because I was too afraid to read it
My appetite calling my name, I gotta feed it
I'm giving myself therapy no counseling needed
I'm bout to go insane with blood walling in my vanes
Head pounding from a twenty ton migraine
People beating on my room door try'na check on me
Sinister recurring nightmares resurrected on me
What do you do when the world try'na test ya
When ya fulfill or when ya crack under the pressure
I don't even know who I am memory fails me
Maybe you can open my last letter and tell me

I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
High as a muthafucka now I feel better
Slanging to me nigga you ain't no enemy
Murder these rappers is what the beast that he telling me
I'm alone contemplating writing my last letter
A pen and a pad makes me feel better

I'm alone in the dark writing my last letter
Cause the life that I lead I feel like getting no better
Try'na maintain and toughen out the weather
I'm good and holding back tears scared of no man
But it's hard that I feel so I'm screaming for help
But it's like my yell fall on deaf ears
This is happiness I'm chasing but if I catch it
Can I stand tall and face it, used to feel yearn
So I can't take it alone in the dark
Listening to my heart, my brain has a shorty
It keeps telling me nigga go straight for they heart
And murder these rappers they just fish in the sea
You the great white shark, so I turn the bottle up to drown that kayotic thoughts
Cause he ripping me apart
I'm struggling to maintain but he driving me insane
Leave me alone get the fuck outta my brain!


Ha ha!
I was laying on my palled, drinking mount of a jalice
Forming a strategy a premeditated malice
Contemplating the worst and fighting with two decisions
Imprisoned by three de-hologram visions
My tongue be blow torch in em and flaming them brauns
I respond by spinning off nine demean spuns
I de-failure in faith to your knee cosmetic trims
Amputate your legs and chop off your prosthetic limbs
I'm a killer without a mask but I ain't on a TV
Look directly in that camera cause I wanted em to see me
I was uh, hold up, I just need a moment
Cause I just saw the bodies of my next ten opponents
Doctors wanna copy me and snatch talent out of me
The surgical procedure was not before properly
I'm obviously not normal half crazy I gotta be
World on my shoulders I got a planet on top of me",https://genius.com/K-rino-last-letter-lyrics
When the Bombs Drop,The Day of the Storm,2011.0,"Empty out'cha pockets put it down
Spread it all on the ground
Time to gimme what'cha owe me right now
None of y'all better make a sound
Better hope ya not around
When the mountain making bombs drop down

My children, my children, what is this I'm hearing?
These racist police got my people out here disappearing
The ghetto is offended, they killed the fourth amendment
They targeting the Latinos and African descendants
I was recently selected as underground superintendent
I'm not signed to a label I sell music independent
And I'm still try'na stack and break bread with my Kindred
The enemy attempted to seek and murder our women
When a wise man gives you some guidance you got to use it
What Farrakhan is saying is true, if not disprove it
The foolish, make mockery and lie because they clueless
Just keep on slandering and time will tell what the real truth is
Now soon you'll get a chance to witness what that will do
A big Bill Basinski and Bill Gates are out to kill you
Sneak up on them demons and crash the tea party
Then it's wrong at 3: 39 but was gone by 3: 40, so


When the first one fell I grabbed my shield and lit one up
See we all living hell I must prevail my fist is clutched
We been mistreated and these demons keep on sucker-punchin'
But when the time comes my mind run so I keep on dumpin'
I know it's ugly, when we plottin' revenge
On another buster when he puts his hands on my sisters and shed some tears from my mother
Somebody better get em for I touch em
Cops don't listen, gotta get em tell em, karma here it comes
And you can run, but'chu can't hide when he's drop that bomb
What lake am I Shalom in the form from Children of the Corn
He bleeds from thorns, and hides from fakes and cakes and snakes in ways to break within
Again my system creeps, ejected by enemies
R.I.P. and I really do hope one day that I see ya
Cause when the bombs come and they can all run
You can't escape what a way you was fake you're all done
Cause when the bombs come and they can all run


I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened up and read it, it said ""we know you gettin' paid
Empty out'cha pockets and give us what'cha owed to us
Money, keys, and wallets slap your whole family belongs to us
Anything you say or do, will be held against you
Ain't no runnin from the man can't no weapon protect you
I ain't scared don't mind their threats, I'm a military minded vet
SPC the click we rising against the oppression trick
Money on my mind so these verses staying loaded
My pen is like a detonator C4 explosive
Deadly when I'm in the booth, pull a pistol better shoot
Sniper lose his mind blow his brains out like a Dormant Crew
In the streets they hatin' me, say what I want, do what I please
Speak against the forces that be, I'm an anomaly
Do you understand the situation created by the nation?
It's preparation to avoid annihilation",https://genius.com/K-rino-when-the-bombs-drop-lyrics
If You’s A Ho,K-Rino,1998,"I'm sick of these dope fiend rapping ass suckers
Sick of these materialistic motherfuckers
Bragging on their clothes and shit, their hoes and shit
When K-Rino throws a fit my foes will get
Fucked. When I roll up, hold up your hands, black
All that you said, it’s too late for you to hop on my sack
It’s highly likely that I will diss you for that rhyme you spit
Somebody wipe me with some tissue (Why?) ‘Cause I’m the shit
I grab the mic and clear my throat to show you who I am
Once kicked a rhyme so hard I heard a baby holler, “Damn!”
Graphic, malicious grill crasher, you could steel my Black Book
Break my neck, cut out my tongue and I’ll still smash ya
Challenge your fear but you disappear
These suckers biting on my verse just like Tyson on Holyfields ear
Bring the drama fool, I promise I’ma bump your ass
All I can do is tell your family where I dumped your ass

‘If You’s a Ho’ let us know
But if you wanna flow like some killers, grab the mic and let’s go
‘If You’s a Ho’ let us know
But if you wanna flow like some killers, grab the mic and let’s go

K-Rino the king, I rough you up with some fast reading
Rhymes cramped his stomach up like a period and left his ass bleeding
You ignorant rappers need to quit
All you talk about is smoking weed, fucking women, shooting guns, the same shit
I’ll break your whole day down
You stepped at 12 o’clock, bumped his gums at 1, by 2 his ass was on the ground
Riding my bone like some rims
Hoping that these nuts melt in his mouth like M&M's
You feel like you can flow but if you stepped to K-Rino
I’ma wreck your basic style and hope your family at the show
Yo, this ain’t no time for faking ‘cause a lot of rappers thought enough
But I bet this shoe fit up your ass if I kick hard enough
Fruit cake ass rhymes couldn’t win against my granny
So you’ll know I’ll send you home in nothing but some damn panties
Take your money, take your nuts, your title, then I’ll break your neck clean
I’ll even take that girl that you were fucking in that wet dream
Boy it’s me and you


I’ll make them shiver, I’ll rank your monkey ass up the river
And you ain’t got to come pick these raps up ‘cause I deliver
Like dominoes, lyrics by the slice
If ain’t there in thirty minutes then I’ll bust your ass for half price
I got the potential to kill many
But you be hanging round me, all up on my nuts like you was Lil’ Penny
Ghetto tactics I employ, seek and destroy
Jab him, 
put him in a Boston crab
 and stab him, y’all better get this boy
Torture your weak mind for tryna play K
Try me and I pimp you on the mic like Sweet Daddy be doing JJ
Fake reciters, I be cracking plenty of ‘em
Matters how many of ‘em, bring 5, bring 10, fuck bring 20 of ‘em
Yo, we’ll go some rounds if the fool's able
But I break you like A.C. Chill or Rapper K on the pool table
Call my shot before I drop it, 
chalk my microphone up
Punk ass rapper in the corner pocket",https://genius.com/K-rino-if-yous-a-ho-lyrics
Crucified,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"Yeah, one time for ya mind
They tryna hang ya boy from a cross in this rap game
I got nails in my wrist

Now it's time for me to say goodbye to you
Forget a drive-by, I get inside a car and drive through you
You can live across the water, I ain't tripping I'll fly to you
Incoherent, you don't know if you dead or alive do you?
Whoever said I wasn't one of the coldest lyricist, screw you
Whatever the so-called greatest can do fool, I can do too
Most great lyricists are real repetitions, that's too true
Rap the same way on every song, every album, that's boo-boo
I'm a lyrically scientific philosophical guru
A master lyricist with the spirit to Shaka Zulu
I don't fly over your head on every paragraph to woo you
I rather consistently conceptualize and relate to you
Don't sweat these fake critics that speak on you like they knew you
Don't let nobody dictate your style, young homie do you
The same fool that's rapping about running the bullet through you
Is a {?] ballerina wearing a florescent pink tutu
While you stealing ideas and got people wanting to sue you
We was with you girl in the motel room, running a choo-choo
And she ain't tryna leave till every member of my crew through
And all these years you thought she was sweet, innocent who knew?
To try to pick one best rapper is stupid to attempt do to
Like a fool who stepping in shit, putting they foot inside a new shoe
You was mentally stagnant and your audience outgrew you
I paid a hundred bucks just to come to your show just to boo you

They wanna check and try me, try to musify me
But when I hit 'em blindly, they be screaming why me
No respect, deny me, unaware that I'll be
Lyrically the coldest, you doubted? Reply and see

Under the radar, underdog, under appreciated
Underground, misunderstood and underrated
My natural love and passion for writing became jaded
I gave 'em intelligence but to garbage they gravitated
To the uninterested lame and I cried and narrated
To the multitude that hated, I maneuvered and navigated
They be hoping that I sell out and become integrated
To this non-symmetrical imbalanced industry they created
People ask me all the time, ""K, how come you never made it?""
It's because in lollipop world I never participated
When you hear my words I want you to think and be elevated
How can my diamonds and my cars help your life get situated?
You ain't saying shit in your songs, that's why your light faded
Two weeks after they dropped that trash it was outdated
Went platinum, turned your back on the hood, you violated
If you don't show love to your fans, then you need to be castrated
You fell off and went broke embarrassed and degraded
Your career was like an illusion that you hallucinated
From day one in the game, on thin ice you skated
And when you finally fell through the community celebrated

They wanna check and try me, try to musify me
But when I hit 'em blindly, they be screaming why me
No respect, deny me, unaware that I'll be
Lyrically the coldest, you doubted? Reply and see",https://genius.com/K-rino-crucified-lyrics
Shoot to Kill,No Mercy,1999.0,"Yo, Seven, you down to rip ‘em?
Hell yeah
Then show your skill
How you want this shit to go?
Man, it don’t matter, shoot to kill
Handle the mic like you be handling the steel
How you want this shit to go?
Man, it don’t matter, shoot to kill

Spot rocking with stigmata, I guess it’s the gift
Heal the crippled when I rip the freestyle on a metro lip
Quick to go to war ‘cause I don’t  your mama and them
Take your wife and your  daughter and beat your ass with a bicycle rim
And when you know it, you went out like a hoe
Talking like, “”  Nigga, you got D-Boed, you got Ramboed
And your cousins wouldn’t even help ‘cause I was in fucking up-mode
Tsk tsk, I see dead people
Like emcee died when he bit my rhyme and didn’t know the flow was lethal
They tried to kill me by giving me cancer (You can’t get rid of that)
Shit, if DB came on and then rocked a verse, then cancer gave me back
Vision my wisdom but you scared to look
I’m hieroglyphics in the sonic bible, the Quran and K-Rino’s Book
You can be deaf and dumb and it wouldn’t change shit
Plug up my ears, rip out my tongue and  your ass in sign language, bitch

Felony, you down to rip ‘em?

Yo it don’t matter, shoot to kill
Handle the mic like you be handling the steel
Man, how you want this shit to go?
Yo, it don’t matter, shoot to kill

When I lock and load, I make blocks explode
Lyrical C4, the plastics, fuck the Glocks you hold
I was told once before never kick a man when he’s down
I hate to tell you, what better time to serve a hater with rounds
Lace him with pounds of ammo, shake that snake out the ground
Have him regretting, crossing state lines, sliding his ass in H-Town
Can’t hit the breaks now, I see you don’t like the way the 40 cal sound
Scared to death, got your face down, feeling like out of place now
My nigga listen, my rhymes are like illegal prescriptions
So codeine and Sprite mix it cold, pharmaceutical 
Skill-dropping is like pill-popping, numbs your brain into submission
Only to awake to a headache, just in time to hear the slugs whistling
The Rhyme Felon, bid you farewell, only time can tell
I inhale and breathe life, refreshing off minds that’s stale
No stopping these top pedigree from the dirty streets out the cell
I shoot to kill from a Coupe de Ville, translating your heaven into hell

K-Rino, you down to wreck ‘em?
Hell yeah
Then show your skill
How you want this shit to go?

Handle the mic like you be gripping the steel
How you want this shit to go?
It don’t matter, shoot to kill

Yo, straight out the gutter, stomach cutter, at will I slice
Decapitate a crew and made their heads roll like dice
Lyrics inserted, cops alerted, I’ll blast at foes
Don’t want the preacher throwing up, leave the casket closed
Punish my victims then inflcit them with pain and stress
Another radical recital ignites your chest
Beating a sucker motherfucker for calling me fake
How many blows to the nose can one man take?
I got to pop ya just to stop ya from dissing my clique
Breaking your ass with a blast or blow so quick
Making you frown with a round, you duck and wish
Man I’m so down I could drown a fucking fish
Unleash the vocals, every local can feel the sting
Took off my vest, shot up my chest, didn’t feel a thing
You see me stepping with the rep and the mic I thrash
Since you don’t like me get this Nike up out your ass

Unless you’re into stroking and licking on armed dicks

Eat hoe ass louse, yeah they still after me
But they can’t catch, not today
And then five ass niggas want me locked away
I’ma bring it to the light and it sparks in the dark
When this  catch your , it’s gon’ rip it apart
Now uh, who gots the feeling for a thrilling killing?
I promise it to be chilling when this nigga stop living
I’m giving slugs to mugs then he stripped in 
Payback's a motherfucker when you dripped in blood
The last time I came, rushed the loot and still
But this time to gain, it’s to shoot and kill

You down to wreck ‘em?

Trust that I murder first

Handle the mic like you handle the steel
Well can I use your new bazooka?
It don’t matter, shoot to kill

You ain’t said nothing
Whenever I’m busting, I shoot to kill
I use to chill but now I got to execute the deal
The juice is real, a hundred percent freshly squeezed
SPC’s best emcees, it’s best you leave
Because we fucking up the game for you niggas that’s rapping fame
Tryna make a name, DBX is taking aim
No warning shots ‘cause I ain’t tryna wound ‘em or injure ‘em
Helpless is how I render ‘em
Dead is how I remember ‘em
I’ll  ya, in ’99, I use a Ruger
So dammit, Eyque, how the fuck you load this bazooka?

You call ‘em up for help today, they show up yesterday
Right or wrong, they got your back and they ain’t never cappin’
They see you fightin’, they start fightin’, they don’t even know what happened
See these the ones that you can hit up when you need to borrow
They’ll be down with me if this rap thing play out tomorrow
They’ll roll up with you when it’s time to air some drama out
You know you real if you can bring ‘em to your mama’s house
Some of ‘em I’ve been knowin’ since I was a little dude
Acting a fool, see we was cool way back in middle school
I gots to give my family props, I can’t drop it plainer
No matter what they in your corner like a boxing trainer
They never acted brand new and never tried to clown
Never pushed up on my woman if I’m out of town
They hear somebody talkin’ ‘bout you, they gon’ check ‘em fast
And when it’s on, they comin’ full blast, no questions asked
Check this out

This for my day 1’s, my day 1’s
These my people that been rockin’ with me if I had some paper or I made none
When it comes to friends, the tougher the better
Get in trouble, struggle or bubble, together, man, it’s whatever
These my day 1’s, my day 1’s
These my people that been rockin’ with me if I had some paper or I made none
When it comes to friends, the tougher the better
Get in trouble, struggle or bubble, together, man, it’s whatever

Might not see my homies everyday but still the same
Years in the game, they can call you by your real name
We hood-certified, crazy how the struggle made us
We get into it then be right back cool a hour later
If money made then we be at that table, breaking bread
They got me if I ever need a place to lay my head
Or if I’m stranded and I call ‘em, they come pick me up
Shoe on the other foot, they know that they can hit me up
And even if we bumping heads, I still know they got me
They stay the same, they don’t switch up to impress nobody
Respect both ways ‘cause all of us been payin’ dues
Ain’t never jealous when you comin’ up or makin’ moves
You got a real one in your circle, better say your prayers
Can whoop, feed and discipline my kids like they was theirs
When friends show you they worthy of trust, that’s when it’s earned
They show you love without lookin’ for nothing in return
You ‘bout to learn

This for my day 1’s, my day 1’s
These my people that been rockin’ with me if I had some paper or I made none
When it comes to friends, the tougher the better
Get in trouble, struggle or bubble, together, man, it’s whatever
These my day 1’s, my day 1’s
These my people that been rockin’ with me if I had some paper or I made none
When it comes to friends, the tougher the better
Get in trouble, struggle or bubble, together, man, it’s whatever

Everybody wanna hang out when you blowin’ cash
But you find out who’s really with you when it’s goin’ bad
It’s only certain cats I trust in life to never play me
Friendship ain’t endin’ over shady dudes or shady ladies
Been through some crazy situations that was hell to witness
They know the dirt you did but they don’t ever tell your business
The evil people show they true colors with hearts deceiving
Start talkin’ bad about ya the second y’all start to beefin’
We used to catch the bus long before they heard of us
Years in the game, we got ten, twenty, thirty plus
It ain’t too many you can trust whether right or wrong
Not everyone can take that pressure once them lights come on
It’s good to know that through it all I know just who to call
Runnin’ the streets, studio sessions and shootin’ ball
Not just my boys, I got some homegirls, salute to y’all
See once I know you real, I’ll help you out, run through a wall
So tell ‘em all

This for my day 1’s, my day 1’s
These my people that been rockin’ with me if I had some paper or I made none
When it comes to friends, the tougher the better
Get in trouble, struggle or bubble, together, man, it’s whatever
These my day 1’s, my day 1’s
These my people that been rockin’ with me if I had some paper or I made none
When it comes to friends, the tougher the better
Get in trouble, struggle or bubble, together, man, it’s whatever

See, real homies are hard to find, yours and mine, don’t disregard the signs, see they with ya regardless, minus the fraudness, I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout them snakes, man, I’m talkin’ ‘bout the one you can hit at 4 in the morning, whatever’s goin’ on, they poppin’ up, they ridin’ wit’cha, day 1’s, male and female, day 1’s, just make sure you one too",https://genius.com/K-rino-my-day-1s-lyrics
Already Answered,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"Tell me if you feel this

Sometimes you don’t have a clue ‘bout how you gon’ make it through
All you know is when the smoke clears, you usually do
Before the stressin’ and depression and the panic is mixed
You look up and notice the issue is already fixed
Then be like ‘Wow,’ be like ‘How?,’ feeling shocked and amazed
But why you reacting that way? Don’t you remember you prayed?
You asked the creator to help you through the difficult days
But walked away still not believing the path had been laid
You think because you can’t handle it, the problem’s irreparable
But in the Most High’s eyes, that thought’s unacceptable
I’ve seen it for years, it could bring me to tears
Meanings are clear, God laughs at the things that we fear
When we believe, He’ll start pouring the gifts out freely
Smashing obstacles to show you that impossible’s easy
You pacing and freaking out like the game is over
Disregarding everything that he plainly showed ya

That prayer you prayed, it’s already answered
That call you made is already answered
Want Him to make a way, you gotta make one too
If you believe in Him it ain’t nothing you can’t get through
Even you
That prayer you prayed, it’s already answered
That call you made is already answered
Want Him to make a way, you gotta make one too
If you believe in Him it ain’t nothing you can’t get through

You ever been totally broke when the rent was due?
Then seemingly out of the blue, it got sent to you?
We don’t believe in no magic, just the sowing of seeds
Virtuous deeds reap blessings in the moment of need
We push the panic button then start complaining instead
When things are not going our way, we start hanging our head
You don’t know what faith is about so you sit and you pout instead of praying first then working to figure it out
Living in doubt pushes you further away from success
You stop believing in yourself and start to bathe in distress
Our ways are out of touch, we be doing too much
Have you forgot how many times He came through in the clutch?
But see you in a rush, your image of blessings are backwards
You expect ‘em next day like a FedEx package
Coincidences, imaginary luck is fraud
‘cause when you give luck the credit, you insultin’ God

That prayer you prayed, it’s already answered
That call you made is already answered
Want Him to make a way, you gotta make one too
If you believe in Him it ain’t nothing you can’t get through
Even you
That prayer you prayed, it’s already answered
That call you made is already answered
Want Him to make a way, you gotta make one too
If you believe in Him it ain’t nothing you can’t get through

We don’t understand His power, that’s why we wonder
He already answered your call before you dialed His number
Disbelief still occupying space in your mind
If you don’t think He’s gonna help you, why you wasting your time?
You’re too lazy to grind, gotta put your foot in the dirt
You want the payoff, but you don’t wanna put in the work
Don’t let ‘em tell you that your mission can’t come to fruition
Not even prison can stop or hinder someone with a vision
Give people what you wanna get, preference with that
When you be a blessing to others, God blesses you back
It ain’t about who’s the best dressed or first in the church
Helping people causes karma to work in reverse
Some people looking for God but don’t know where to find Him
Don’t be doing good deeds with bad motives behind them
I’m a fool still striving, still lost, but I give
I’m not telling you what I heard, I’m telling you what I live

That prayer you prayed, it’s already answered
That call you made is already answered
Want Him to make a way, you gotta make one too
If you believe in Him it ain’t nothing you can’t get through
Even you
That prayer you prayed, it’s already answered
That call you made is already answered
Want Him to make a way, you gotta make one too
If you believe in Him it ain’t nothing you can’t get through",https://genius.com/K-rino-already-answered-lyrics
Wreckin’ Um,Danger Zone,1995,"I’m Wreckin’ Um, all you suckers that tried to diss me
I’m Wreckin’ Um, all you hoes that wouldn’t kiss me
I’m Wreckin’ Um, punks who shot the bullets but they missed me
I’m Wreckin’ Um, in your face is where my fist be
I’m Wreckin’ Um, all you suckers that tried to diss me
I’m Wreckin’ Um, all you hoes that wouldn’t kiss me
I’m Wreckin’ Um, punks who shot the bullets but you missed me
I’m Wreckin’ Um, check it out

Dope verses I’m pumping them, your rhymes ain’t shit so I’m dumping them
Had a fight one on one, sucker swore I was jumping him
Yeah you started quick, but I came and jumped ahead of you fast
Talk so much shit you ought to wipe your mouth instead of your ass
I’m here to punish, this is torture not a jolly course
You bit my rhymes until your damn teeth caught a charley horse
I kicked a funny rhyme and all the suckers laughed at me
Jordan retired ‘cause he heard the Rockets drafted me
No matter how you try, no matter how you try you bust
Allah has giving me a mentally eternal thrust
If I get broke enough, I'll swoop down like a heaven breeze
Catch ya businessman and jack his ass for selling Gs
You brought a bunch of nonsense but me bringing this
A gun or knife or stick, I’ll break a pipe by swinging fist
If it ain’t nothing but talk I might not throw a lick
But if you know shit is real I’ll drop your ho ass quick
So I’ma kick another frantic volcanic
Never known to panic, rough rhyme mechanic
Women can’t stand it ‘cause I’ve never been romantic
Your rhyme's the Titanic, I’m an iceberg in the Atlantic
*Interlude*

Ocean causing a commotion
Erosion detonator and poisonous potion, venomous chest explosion
Swoll him up, stomach punches'll fold him up
My Black Book will slap his ass to death while I hold him up
Yo, you tried to roll but your tire stuck, think you’re dope, try your luck
Boy, I rolled through hell in a fire truck
So if there’s a chance you think I might not be checking ‘em
Ask your mama 'bout me fool, because I’m Wreckin’ Um

Now I’m down with Islam you wanna know how it’s learning me
How long can I flow? Double forever multiplied with eternity
Skills have increased, students came and I taught my flocks
Styles puzzled the genius, confused the unorthodox
Here’s your death papers, trick, sign them
To picture me pissed off, imagine every World War, combine them
Rewind them, combine them again and rewind them
I’m above, below, in front of his face and behind him
So MCs I’ma ruin your fucking route
Rhymes like a curved one pitch, struck em out
Shooting precise, seven shots bucked 10 to 3
Power so deep the black hole got sucked into me
You say I’m great ‘cause I’ve downed so many foes
I ought to join a circus ‘cause I’ve clowned so many hoes
But either way I kick the styles that break your bones
Shattering domes, hitting and splitting your chromosomes
Jack me, I never need a sucker to back me
I break in, suckers break out as if they had acne
So intellectual I think past scholars
So cool I sold a fifty cent piece for thirty dollars
Yo, intellectually advanced when I flow
You should know, I plug a mic in your ass and get HBO
So sucker jock me, all of my foes do it
Fell so deep in love with the mic that I proposed to it
Somebody dissed me, so yo if you did it go get it bro
I’m busting up your face like Riddick Bowe
I got them hands so I might ding ding ya fast
You can bring a damn bee, I’ll sting his ass
Fuck the Devil, I’m quick to diss a hippy
I’ll beat your ass from California to Mississippi
I’ma moon ya with some rough drama soon
But since we right here by your crib, go get my draws out your mama' room",https://genius.com/K-rino-wreckin-um-lyrics
The Follow-up Session,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"La da da da da da
Um, Ms Wilson, you can go ‘head and send the next patient in now, thank you
Mr. K, wow, didn’t expect to see you here
I know
Your follow-up session with me was scheduled years ago
I tried calling you a few times, it made me wonder
Yeah I know, I ignored your phone calls and changed my number
Why?
I had to do some soul-searching pretty fast
Plus that hundred an hour you charge was kicking my ass
The more I thought about it, the more I started to hate you
But I was starting to feel we were on the verge of a breakthrough
Ha, I made due over that period of time
Plus I’m sure you had cases more serious than mine
So I fell back, planning to abandon any help
And any problems that I had I tried to handle ‘em myself
Hmm, so how’d that work out for you, going off the grid?
It didn’t work, I wouldn’t be back in your office if it did
Well I’m glad you finally made a new appointment so let’s load up
Appointment? I ain’t got no damn appointment, I just showed up
Oh really?
Yeah really, do you have any objection?
Well, last time you pulled a gun so I guess I’ll make an exception
I apologize for that, doc, I’m really not that type, I was going through a turbulent period in my life, I had woman problems, money problems, professional struggles, plus spiritual internal warfare, I was in trouble
Are you still making music?  Well yeah, I’m still tryin’
How’s it going?
Lots of people listening, not too many buying
Out of millions of people who could possibly consume it?
Man, my last album probably sold five hundred units
That’s all?
You tryna be funny?
No, no, I’m just surprised, if you want to, we can change the subject
Yeah, that would be wise
Well, please answer this without any malice or hatred - what would you say right now is the biggest challenge you’re facing?
Well, it’s hard for me to find any peace, balance or patience, and as the calendar’s racing, I feel my talent is wasting, this repetitious redundancy ain’t arousing to me, I wish I could go to sleep and make it be 2003, I be feeling like some kind of force is blocking me in life plus recently some trifling bastard got me for my bike so now I’m pissed, ready to wipe somebody out
Hey calm down, this aggressiveness I’ve found appears to be going around, a lot of my clients seem to be under that same spell, matter of fact, lately I’ve been quite aggravated as well
You, doc?
Yes, I just haven’t dealt with it directly, see, seven months ago, my wife of twenty years left me, we’re going through a nasty divorce and having clashes ‘cause she’s tryna take my children and half of my damn practice
Whoa, whoa, doc, yo, you ok?
I’m fine, hear me out
Ok, why don’t I sit in your chair and you lay on the couch, truth be told, I just came in here to get me a little therapy, but maybe I should leave because right now you’re kinda scaring me
No, you can’t leave, sorry, I just feel broken and used, I just need to talk to somebody, K
Aight, man, cool, what happened?
She set me up and played me like a damn fool, she cheated and ran away with my buddy from grad school
That’s strong, so what’chu gonna do? Here, man, take this pillow
I was wondering if you knew someone that I could pay to kill her
Hell naw, say bro, now I’m really about to go
I have the whole thing planned out, no one would ever know
Excuse me, ma’am, (yes) please come and get this man, he in here stressin’
(I’m just a receptionist, sir, I don’t interfere with sessions)
Ok, well I’m out, and I’m sorry for what you went through, and I’m charging five g’s to keep this session confidential
Man, fool done lost his mind, tryna get me jammed up, hell no, not the kid, not the kid",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-follow-up-session-lyrics
Everythang Is Great,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"Livin’ good, no cappin’ is real
Still got a lot of money left after the bills
Get your own , homie, don’t hate on me
I went from a young no-name to straight OG
Walking ‘round well fed ‘cause the streets supply me
You ain’t gotta watch your back if you ain’t cheat nobody
Lay low, keep your mouth closed, folks is jealous
Can’t nobody talk your business unless you tell it
Got my own, I ain’t one of these thirsty people
Self-made entrepreneur, my work is legal
If I see you doing good, I’ma clap that up
If you reach your hand out, I’ma dap that up
It’s all love, everything I got I’m glad to get
Can’t be walkin’ ‘round all the time mad and shit
Keep people with bad energy from hanging around
‘cause if they ain’t liftin’ you up then they bringin’ you down
Tell ‘em

Uh
Everythang is great
Move around, you ain’t gotta entertain the hate
I’m ready now, I ain’t come up in this game to wait
No complaining, I’m staying in my lane, I’m straight
They don’t like that
Everythang is great
Move around, you ain’t gotta entertain the hate
I’m ready now, I ain’t come up in this game to wait
No complaining, I’m staying in my lane, I’m straight

God first, never put a lot of trust in men
Gotta know what you’re doing, can’t just pretend
Might slip every now and then and bust your chin
Sometimes you gotta take a loss just to win
Can’t promise you in life that a tear won’t drop
Can’t forget about my homeboy still on lock
Some of ‘em are comin’ home soon, some of ‘em not
And I’m prayin’ for the ones still workin’ the block
Don’t let nobody disrespect you, ignore ‘em and go
If homeboy ain’t actin’ right, baby, show him the door
If lil mama ain’t rockin’ wit’cha, go and let ‘em make it
Sometimes you gotta face it and take it back to the basics
Don’t hit the panic button, stay calm and steady
If you takin’ care of your babies, you done won already
I’m makin’ my own change, can’t fall in the game
‘cause everyday I hear the moneybags callin’ my name so tell ‘em

Uh
Everythang is great
Move around, you ain’t gotta entertain the hate
I’m ready now, I ain’t come up in this game to wait
No complaining, I’m staying in my lane, I’m straight
They don’t like that
Everythang is great
Move around, you ain’t gotta entertain the hate
I’m ready now, I ain’t come up in this game to wait
No complaining, I’m staying in my lane, I’m straight

I’m too cool for the BS’ing, I ain’t with that stressing
If it’s something you praying for, I hope you get that blessing
Even if your money low and you been struggling a while
Happiness is free, it don’t cost nothing to smile
To somebody, even if you don’t feel right
You might keep somebody else from flippin’ out that night
Pickin’ up another person ain’t wrong to do
Be strong for the ones who ain’t as strong as you
In life, you can make what you need from it appear
I compete with myself ‘cause I’m the only one that I fear
Got a message for the haters who been breaking the rules
The only thing I love more than winning is making you lose
If we let the fake win, then the real won’t grow
You gotta rep for your partners who ain’t here no more
Don’t be wasting your time living with them negative vibes
Have fun on this trip, you only get one ride so tell ‘em

Uh
Everythang is great
Move around, you ain’t gotta entertain the hate
I’m ready now, I ain’t come up in this game to wait
No complaining, I’m staying in my lane, I’m straight
They don’t like that
Everythang is great
Move around, you ain’t gotta entertain the hate
I’m ready now, I ain’t come up in this game to wait
No complaining, I’m staying in my lane, I’m straight",https://genius.com/K-rino-everythang-is-great-lyrics
Square the Game Off,No Mercy,1999.0,"My phone rung, 11 o'clock, I'm feeling tight
It's that girl that I gave my number at the store the other night
""What's up?"" ""What you doing?"", ""I'm just watching TV""
""Why don't you come over to my crib and you can watch it with me?""
""Now who you stay with?"", ""I got my own apartment and ride""
""Well man, write down the directions I be chilling outside""
Sure enough, twenty minutes later, time to escape
I got my toothbrush, my rubbers and my Dolemite tape
On the way there, ""Hold up, where your husband or man?""
""Boy I'm single, I do what I want"", ""Aight, don't be playing""
When I got there, I kicked back like I was in charge
Hit the shower, then I let her give my back a massage
I'm almost about to stick her on the living room floor
Till I hear knock, ""Who is that at the door?""
""Oh shit that's my boyfriend, I thought he was gone
If he catch you in this motherfucker it's gon' be on""
""It's gon' be on?"" I peeped outside this fool ain't alone
He got three more homies out there with 'em, ""Hand me the phone""
""Who you calling?"", ""I'm calling DBX and Eyque
Man I knew that I would get in trouble fooling with you""
This fool screamed out, he coming in the door to kill me
Counted 1, counted 2, kicked it down on 3
Now I'm standing in the living room holding a bat
But I still ain't got no win, cause he was holding a gat
Now I'm telling and explaining, feeling just like a fool
Tryna figure out a way to steal his ass on the cool
Then she squared him off, cussed him out and told me to stay
She said, ""I was about to dump your sorry ass anyway""
This fool click, he got more agg and said, ""You a lie""
If I leave this motherfucker everybody gon' die
Man why do I have to sit up and try
To justify what somebody put me in being fly?
When my boys came 20 deep, I knew I was fine
And them 3 fools that he was with started changing their mind
""Baby, grab your phone book, find K and scratch my name off
It's too late, you should of squared the damn game off""

Square the game off, why take a chance?
All you gotta do is just tell me in advance
Square the game off, ain't no need to lie
Keep it on the real, that way don't nobody die

I was chilling at MacGregor park, minding my own
My boy Bomber kicking back on the cellular phone
I see Mack, D.D., Cliff, White Mike, Richard and Ray
Punch, Ellis, Bo and Polo, shit I'm ready to play
Drug and Wind pick me up, my shot was all right
I'm gon' win big by four or five and call it a night
But there's this girl on the sideline checking me out
Uh oh, let me go and see what this is about
I ain't even have no haircut and I'm dressed real cheap
But I was knocking down them motherfucking jumpers from deep
She said, ""I like the way you shoot the ball, do you ever miss?""
""It really ain't nothing to it baby, it all in the wrist""
""When it come to ball players I can never resist""
Hmm, pulled out the pen and paper, ""Write your number on this""
Right then, here some fool come straight agging a fit
One of the hoopers that I just beat, that's who she was with
Aw shit, now analyze how ignorant he act
He about 6'8"" 240, I ain't tryna see that
He stood madder than a pit bull, 'bout ready to swing
But his partner that he rolled wit had seen the whole thing
Straight told him what she did tried to make his boy see
Here she come, ""Who you gon' believe, that nigga or me?
Boo I love you, so anything he say, I don't care
How I look tryna do that when you right over there""
Now girl you good, so while the boy was tryna think
I left but when I looked back, she gave me a wink
Man it's over, so my hidden assassins took their aim off
It's dangerous when somebody don't square the game off

Square the game off, why take a chance?
All you gotta do is just tell me in advance
Square the game off, ain't no need to lie
Keep it on the real, that way don't nobody die

Won't nobody die
Won't nobody die
Won't nobody die
Won't nobody die",https://genius.com/K-rino-square-the-game-off-lyrics
Sometimes,80 Minute Eternity,2012,"Straight up before you came in all she had was lame men
Repeated the same trend of scheming and gaming
You helped her surpass this, made all of it past tense
Rescued her from bad biz, then showed her what class is
Turned her into your queen, took care of her offspring
Ignoring her past although you knew that was a hard thing
Every day and night black, pushed her towards the right track
Disrespect and no affection, you kept her despite that
Slowly now the whole truth, you being exposed to
Problems that you go through, she never consoled you
Quick to label her ex fast, from you she just gets cash
The only man who ever cared gets treated like wet trash
Look at how you treat her man, you keep thinking she can change
Years later she ain't change, through it all he remain
Unappreciated but it's you I have to question
Destined for misery due to a bad investment


Baby girl is on the wrong end of the stick again
A history of of unfortunate trends when picking men
All her life the great relationships she's visioning
But she locker her heart but then scorpions kept slipping in
Now it's another one who get her disillusioned
Talk smooth, bamboozled and fooled her until he moved in
And then his horns came out, she couldn't handle that
He let you pack him on his back, what kind of man is that?
Paying the bills while his efforts are invisible
He living good, meanwhile your life is miserable
You say ""I'm trying to make it work, we got a child together""
Yeah, but it don't make no sense to raise a child in violent weather
You could do way better, you deserve some peace boo
Wasted all that time with a bum that was beneath you
You need a dude who knows how to treat you, and complete you
You gripping on a hand full of nothing, this cat is see through

Sometimes it's better just to let them go
Straighten things in life that you can get to know
Move on into another episode
You better move on, and be strong
Be strong get up and kick them to the curb
You did wrong, was that the lesson you deserved?
Don't let nobody hurt, or bring you down with words
Don't let them bring you down with words, yeaah!

Frustrated with being under appreciated
Can't let them take you for granted even if we're related
Fakers with evil faces, your love is received with hatred
Most of them devious people, ego inebriated
You given them everything really though it's useless
Big difference between being in love and being stupid
A good person been getting wounded, still hoping and wishing on it
Sometimes unconditional love needs a condition on it
You stay around and suffer, that's a mistake
Don't be a part time option to a full time snake
In the end you say ""Something beats nothing"" well that's crazy
Better to be alone than stay with somebody who hurts you daily
Thought you couldn't find nobody else, that's the part you got wrong
Time can't heal a wound, until you put your watch out
Clinging to a fool who using and misdirecting you
You don't care about yourself, how can you expect them to?

Sometimes it's better just to let them go
Straighten things in life that you can get to know
Move on into another episode
Be strong get up and kick them to the curb
You did wrong, was that the lesson you deserved?
Don't let nobody hurt, or bring you down with words
Nobody, nobody bring you down!
Don't let them bring you down
Just keep your head up

(STU: What's going on?)
D-1: You remember the girl you hooked me up with, right?
(STU: The one with the big-)
D-1: Yea, the one with a sister man (Uhu) Why you didn't tell me your girl was crazy dog
(STU: She crazy?)
D-1: Man, let me tell you something man, this is the second time this month she done put my tires on flash, busted out my car windows, call my phone all crazy, showing up in a nigga's (?) and shit, man I don't appreciate that dog. I'm feeling I'mma get a restraining order on this, for real

Crazy women the kind who set your clothes on fire
The ones that bust your car windows out and slash your tires
When it's peaceful she be bored but when it's drama she love it
The one who talk loud and cuss to make a scene out in public
No matter what you try to do for, it ain't no pleasing
First she cool then she pissed off for no damn reason
You in your car check your rear-view, she trailing behind you
She'll blow everybody phone up that you know till she find you
It be seeming like she drunk man but really she's sober
The kind that start cussing the laws out when y'all getting pulled over
Chill your girl but on the cool you kinda scared on the low
Might see a chick that she don't even know and go ""I hate that ho""
The kind who argue all night and always think she right
The type to run up and swag on a dude you wouldn't even fight
She got a case she on probation and still won't quit
The type to come up to your job tripping and starting some shit
And even if she in the wrong, she want you to side with her
And got three or four crazy home girls that arrive with her
Try and leave her, she'll sabotage your whole situation
Go online and dig up all your personal information
Accusing you of things you didn't do to start drama
The kind of chick that bet. not ever introduce to your mama
If you try to break up with her but you married with kids
She goin call your wife and tell her everything that y'all did
She'll infiltrate your stash and bleed your cash
And if you mess around and get her pregnant, debts your ass
But you keep on coming back to her, through all of the plex
Cause everybody know that's crazy woman got the best sex
Yeah

Burning your clothes, nigga you ain't have nothing but some three dollar t-shirts and some over the counter Air-Force Sevens
Not Air-Force Ones, Air-Force Sevens. And about the sex, you have to be talking about mine, cause I got a hundred ninety nine dollar dildo that will make you go gay. And while you bumping your goin see your partners, tell 'em this, I took your head triple platinum in a week's time
BooBoo K.T., I holler

Crazy dude so in love he throwed off in the dome
Hiding in the bushes waiting on your ass to get home
He handcuffing, everything that you doing he wanna know
Going to jail is routine like a trip to the corner store
And even if the cops around you, you don't feel protected
If he don't threaten you at least once a day you feel neglected
The type of dude to fight your daddy and ain't scared of the laws
That'll pop up at your front door with a robe and some drawz
You see him walk the streets daily, but he gone in the mind
Kind you wake up and just find standing over you crying
The kind you couldn't run away from if you move to Iraq
And that restraining order you filed on  him don't mean jack
Fatal attraction to the third power you wish you could leave
He'll go agg. and physically drag you out the club by your weave
All kinds of criminal history and dirt in his folder
The ones that threaten to kill they-self, when you tell him it's over
Told you he loved you the first day that y'all started talking
Always accusing you of looking at other dudes when y'all walking
Twenty-five eight he constantly around your ass
Changing number and move two times still found your ass
Writing crazy letters begging you in every sentence
Left you twenty-five voicemails in fifteen minutes
He real jealous, any trust he tried to show you is phony
And always thinking you sneaking around town with one of his homies
He knows street fighting, Tae-bo, kung-fu and karate
And if he catch you out of line, he goin kill everybody
But you keep on coming back, despite what momma said
Cause he be tearing your little ass up when he gets you in bed",https://genius.com/K-rino-crazy-lyrics
The Canvas,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008.0,"Aah!
Man naw that's not goin get it man
Gotta come better than this
My head is killing me mayne
AAHHH!

Gazing at this blank page channeling my deep cerebral phase
My mind slowly reaches the ninth stage
Boom! Now I've capture it
The paragraphical map is scrambled in my inner-cranial labyrinth
I'm focused let's go after it
I moved in carefully the canvas stares at me with apathy
And as I struggle it sarcastically talks back to me
Frustration pops in the strain out of classical
Concoction is pain staking but failure's not an option
A spark the size of a quark
Try to take shape and develop into what becomes an embryonic thought
My endorphins releases it and starts chasing it
My cerebellum embraces it but I hasten over-anxiousness just erases it
A split second away from delivering
Was at the edge of my mental but quickly back flip it to the River of Oblivion
I'm almost nauseous why should I be cautious
When all this inanimate garbage is under my auspice
The vision within the smooth black pen
But when the concept begins something pushes it back in
All the inspiration ceases a sharp pain increases
Scattered fragments of a thesis but my mind won't release it
Fighting something not typical to fight with
Stare at the page all night till my sight quit my occipital might split
So scandalous as the virgin canvas
With no regard for the man who try the channel his deepest start to romance it

The Canvas
With great works of art rest
Where created inspiration is made manifest
Philosophies and dreams executed by the hand
Before it's send out to man this is where it all began

(The canvas) as fast as the Atlantic
Where the righteous and the rancid ideas of man sit
The organic And the outlandish
The 3 way connection between my thoughts page and the pen that I brandished
I wrote a line I felt from within (yeah)
The page regurgitated back in the form of a flame that melted my pen
I replace it with one I figured was greater
The first acceptable line finally hits the paper several hours later
I was tired but couldn't rest till I'm thru
The canvas spoke to me again and calmly asked, ""Is that best you can do? ""
I said ""Fool, I got a message for you, (ha ha)
How you gon disrespect my work and all of this time I've invested in you? ""
It said, ""You're full of intellectual wealth
You started this so now you gotta live up to the standard you set for yourself
The unparallel creations the times the innovations
The mixture of real life situations and useful information.""
I asked ""Why do you care? "" it replied
""How can you lyrically stimulate people's minds if you and I don't coincide?
Besides the fact I'm being protective of you
Would you wanna have something written on your body that's not reflective of you? ""
Had to agree that it's perspective was true
So in a second or two I brainstormed and intellectually grew
It was torture and my thoughts were exhausted
I didn't draw a mountain side or a wild orchid but a literary portrait
And what I wrote the page no wonder denounced it
My mind pushed and gave birth to a verse that weigh 3 tons and seven ounces
I asked, ""How do you like it"" It said, ""I love it! ""
Now I know my page will only accept words that are worthy of it

Ooh, look at it! It's so beautiful! So beautiful! What shall we name it?

The Basketball Song,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Nah cos, it's my next, I told my boy to come get me
You popped three uptown but fuck it, you can run with me
Stepped on the floor knew I had to withstand beef
Check them up dog, hold up, get your man chief
He took him out and made a move and drove through
To the hole he stole one and he stole two
Went for three should have tried to assist
Wanted to shoot, fucked around and missed
Drove his ass to the hole like a truck
Brothers on the side tried to front like my shot was luck
The sucker holding me was being a ho
He pissed me off I lit his ass for three in a row
What's the count now, nine to nine, cool
Look where your foot at trick, you're behind fool
Foul my ass, you ain't holding that call up
Nah you can't have that bullshit, man ball up
Had the game but you throwed your card away
I started taking they ass like Hardaway
You got the ball trick, take me, you got a clear lane
You took a shot, smack, get that shit of here
We going to twelve, it's eleven up
Twenty footers  like 7Up
I hope that you a good sport
Cause I'm jacking game, get your ass off the court",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-basketball-song-lyrics
We Don’t Expect,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"Fifteen generations
Born, raise, die
Born, raise, die
Born, raise, die
Into a slave condition
But yet we survive

Understand we don't expect you to care
'Cause usually when we get caught up it's a  dare
Got our whole community lost in the depths of despair
You even tricked some of us to think your methods were fair
We walk around with house shoes on and nets on our hair
People don't wanna get to know you and if they let you, it's rare
Hard to reach us even with a positive message to share
We be like ""don't even speak on my name unless it's a prayer""
And it's so hard, we even feelin' like you prayin' is fraud
'Cause if you hate us, they ain't no tellin' what you sayin' to God
We need to trust in those and our own, and stay on our own
How many hours out of each day do we play on our phones
We need attention so bad we be on Facebook cheesin'
Tell everybody where we 'bout to go, what time we leavin'
What we eatin', who we want to fight, and who boyfriend cheatin'
But in the streets it ain't no friends and police do the deletin'

The blood and the lies
And the tears and the pain
The struggle in our eyes
That the years couldn't tame
Generations done died
And still it remains
And it ain't no surprise
That you feel it's a game
So don't blame your evil on me
I know your mad
But we ain't blind no more
You want us gone
But we ain't gonna leave
We ain't goin' nowhere, never

Understand we don't expect you to care
I'm tellin' my people with no nuts to get you a pair
We suffer blindness
Everything wrong we fall in-line with
Its more important things then who some ball player done signed with
Lies told with no appearance of proof
You call the truth hate, 'cause you hate hearin' the truth
And Martin Luther King died when he truly spoke up
They ain't kill him 'cause he had a dream it's 'cause he woke up
And if you thinkin' the systems with you, you got life twisted
If I'm the one who put your car on flat then why would I fix it?
The ghetto been blitz with a sick condition systemic
And made ignorance spread faster than a damn epidemic
Don't ever imitate or mimic nothin' them fools doin'
Quit thinkin' that when they say ""we,"" that, that includes you
See you won't be shocked at all by all the killin' and hatin'
When you understand the nature of the person you facin'

The blood and the lies
And the tears and the pain
The struggle in our eyes
That the years couldn't tame
Generations done died
And still it remains
And it ain't no surprise
That you feel it's a game
So don't blame your evil on me
I know your mad
But we ain't blind no more
You want us gone
But we ain't gonna leave
We ain't goin' nowhere, never

Understand we don't expect you to care
Even as sharecroppers we never received our share
They made promises to ex-slaves while shakin' their hands
And jacked the Indians for two-billions acres of land
A truly free person we was never able to be
Why would they ever want to pay you when the labor was free
We learned after bein' tricked by a biblical half whip
Now I know that ain't Jesus, that's a picture or Brad Pitt
Yeah, yeah
Like I said, we don't expect you to care
How could you when you deliberately infected the air
You up in court innocent, but they don't pay it no mind
How come your own lawyer tryna persuade you to sign
Sympathy for dead blacks, y'all don't take it that far
You cry harder when a damn dog get hit by a car
They ain't gon' ever help you remove that horrible scar
Because unlike us, them demons know who you really are

When you think about all that we survied
Being put into hulls of ships and sailing across the Atlantic
And then surviving that
And being auctioned off, being breeded like animals
Broke family broken up, and then spendin' our lives on a plantation
Listen to me well
Not for three days
Not for three weeks
Not for three hours, or three months, or three years
But for three-hundred years",https://genius.com/K-rino-we-dont-expect-lyrics

Loaded, loaded like a sawed off
I’m loaded like a 12 gauge
Bodies hit the ground once I hit the stage
Loaded, been in the game and I still rip
No matter how many verses I spit I keep a full clip

Can’t fathom the paranormal phrases I flow
When I sleep, my mind writes words on the inside of my eyes, bro
Your head just entered in my swing zone
I infiltrate cell phones
And download anthrax into your ringtone
Me being human was just a rumor
My mother was a thought wave
And my father was a deadly cancerous brain tumor
My syllables pack agility
At any moment, I’ll willingly redevelop the theory of relativity
Without rolling, I’ll win at dice
Telepathically send advice, revert time and then live the same minute twice
Expose electricity to greater shock
I’ll make time skip from 7 to 9 ‘cause I mentally wiped out 8 o’clock
You couldn’t see me from three feet
I massacre sweet, burn you like a cd and then put your murder on repeat
Vocally aim shots ’til brains rot
I knock rappers off different mountain tops
But their bodies drop in the same spot
I’m

I’m loaded like a 12 gauge
Bodies hit the ground once I hit the stage
Loaded, been in the game and I still rip
No matter how many verses I spit I keep a full clip

I reveal with Imhotep’s architectural skill
My intellectual will is real
For me planets only take seconds to build
He wanted The Wizard so I paid him an anonymous visit
I’m calm in a blizzard with a bite like a mad monitor lizard
Eradicate foes with expedience
Recipe poison , they die immediately after reading the ingredients
My syndicate spits with infinite wit
With a specific hit, I make birth certificates insignificant
I frequently become frequency
No mind was made equally
Secretly five minutes of sleep is like a week to me
To battle me is a fallacy
My chemicals naturally unravel and actually cause  allergies
My gradual mastery of my mental capacity
 fasten rapidly into a paragraph cardiomyopathy
I use your carcass for feeding vultures
I’m rebreeding cultures, love to insult ya with  bleeding ulcers

Loaded, loaded like a sawed off
I’m loaded like a 12 gauge
Bodies hit the ground once I hit the stage
Loaded, been in the game and I still rip
No matter how many verses I spit I keep a full clip
I’m loaded, loaded like a sawed off
I’m loaded like a 12 gauge
Bodies hit the ground once I hit the stage
Loaded, been in the game and I still rip
No matter how many verses I spit I keep a full clip

I’m the wildest aggressor, style abolisher, your knowledge is lesser
The scholar tester, at age 2, I taught college professors
Release minerals like the sun do
Twilight zones I run through, we can exchange chromosomes and I’ll become you
No pimp flow, just endless increments of info
Though I  slow, me and a jet plane clocked in identical tempo
My aptitude literally slapped a dude
Unbearable flesh, burning biohazardous chemicals is what my rap exudes
I damage DNA daily and leave genetics scarred
If you’re broke and need a vocal assassination, I take credit cards
Pathetic odds are your chances
I exercise skills that disrespect guys
My voice ejects Colombian neckties
Against me,  voted a million to one that you’re left mad
And the one vote that you got, that came from me because I felt bad
I keep clicking like when the pistol jams
My missile slams like rams, I perform mental exams on sacrificial lambs

Hood Politics,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Wow, it’s gettin’ real crazy out here
Everywhere we look we see crime, poverty, drug-sellin’ and drug-usin’, prostitution, homelessness
We caught up in some true hood politics

Just because they smile and laughin' when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you
Who created hood politics?
Who orchestrates these hood politics?

How long will we continue to live in this condition?
Most of us are livin' in a place where love is missin'
Negligence and dependin' on government assistance
Wishin' for a lick that we can hit, it’s nothing different
Hard to get some money so you almost out of luck now
Had to pull a stunt and got a felony, you stuck now
Did some time in prison, it was rough when you got busted
Couldn’t find no work when you got out, went back to hustlin'
You was still on paper so right back in jail you landed
You followed the formula exactly how they planned it
Locked you in a cell and then they held you like a hostage
‘cause prison is a industry and niggas are the profit
Actin' like they care but secretly, we gettin’ laughed at
How did our hood get tore up? We don’t even ask that
Lookin' for a way to make people open their eyes up
Others makin' laws to guarantee we never rise up

Just because they smile and laughin' when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you
Who created hood politics?
Hey trill, sing it with me, baby, c'mon
Just because they smile and laughin' when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you
Who created hood politics?
Who orchestrates these hood politics?

We be buyin'  when we can’t even afford it
Money runnin' through our hands but somehow we the poorest
Consumin' and not dealin', the cycle’s never-endin'
Not focused on businesses or land, too busy spendin'
How did we become this unproductive is the question
Tennis shoes and jewelry more important than investin’
Took your human rights away, run in your house and blast you
Now we out here beggin’ for somethin’ that should be natural
We don’t own no property so gradually they come slow
Buyin' up the hood and buildin' high-rises and condos
You’ve been out here all your life but this is not your own crib
Too expensive for your ass to stay so where you gon’ live?
Everywhere we seem to look it ain’t nothin' but bad news
Every corner, every block, they poison us with fast food
Always in a bad mood, hate and pressure runs us
That’s why we on dope and every night we hearin’ guns bust

Just because they smile and laughin' when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you
Who created hood politics?
Hey trill, sing it with me, baby, c'mon
Just because they smile and laughin' when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you
Who created hood politics?
Who orchestrates these hood politics?

Politicians seeking office off of selfish reasons
They only come around the hood when it’s election season
Show up at your church looking for votes because they leeching
Soon as they get in, they disappear and you can’t reach ‘em
They legislating every law, they make this like a trap though
Black ones sell us off for higher status on some cash flow
Rewired, I think it’s so that wrong is made to feel right
Silly videos that take our focus off of real life
Broke our manhood, now they shoot us and arrest us
Living off our women, now our women don’t respect us
No one to protect us, ain’t no hope around me
How can he feed his family when he locked up in the county?
Baby mama, baby daddy fightin’ on a daily
Prescription drugs got the people out here going crazy
Purposely they keep us broke and always under stress, man
All because they treating us like pieces in a chess game

Just because they smile and laughin' when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you
Who created hood politics?
Hey trill, sing it with me, baby, c'mon
Just because they smile and laughing when they passin’ through
What’s up?
It don’t mean that they won’t kill you

Every hood in every city
I love the hood
Without the hood, who would I be?

I was raised in the dead end, The Park is my hood
Esperanza, King’s Gate, Orleans, Summer Wood
Made mistakes, had breaks, some bad, some good
And I can think of plenty things that I would change if I could
Born broke, came up out the gates stressing a lot
It be so bad it’s hard to focus on the blessing ya got
Blind leading the blind, reason I’m deceiving the mind
Wish I could take the best years of my life and freeze ‘em in time
Friends faking, not there for I remain so low
We dying so fast I don’t hardly feel the pain no more
And when it’s your turn, don’t fear ‘cause we all must go

Respect mama and daddy, matters what they've done
Make peace with them who gave you life, your blessing'll come
Boys plexing over north, south, west and east
And our ancestors that died can’t even rest in peace
It’s like they gave their life for nothing ‘cause we throwed it away
Just to kill each other, talk down and get blowed everyday
In the hood, roaching and poor hustling, trying to bleed
And when you’re gone from this world, what you gon’ leave to your seed?

The Wizard,Family Bizness (Mixtape),2004.0,"K-Rino, I'm tryna learn how to see with my mind closed and my eyes closed
I'm tryna learn how to see with everything closed
So when I can't open it in public
I can still see, check it out

One rhyme locks 'em in jail, boxing in Hell and sending rappers smallpox in the mail
And throwing punches that make oxygen swell
The fourth quarter will determine whose talent is harder
Slaughter victims in order while drinking a gallon of water
My task see who I can make die fast
Bury the hate and carry the weight of the world on one of my eyelashes
Huh, the flow arena ain't a soft thing
I married the Grim Reaper's daughter and had a half-dead half-living offspring
Smothered a dude mind suffocation 
From his throat doctors removed a fully inflated inner tube
Soul and body separation, gas inhalation
Bowels wasting, now your habitation is your own defecation
And it's ironic the Hell raiser that's never been demonic
I'm dropping more shit then a 300lb man getting a colonic
Nuclear bombers the wicked pharmacist armed with enormous skill
Let's play in a pool of sharks and see who remains the calmest

When he rhyme he change forms most times it's a lizard
K-Rino the ultimate lyricist we call him the Wizard
When he rhyme he switch bodies clinging to your spirit
The Black Book is the magic wand, wicked spells from the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
The Wizard, the Wizard, don't be fucking with the Wizard

My self esteem overcame your lame decapitating scheme
My neck was redeemed after breaking the blade on a guillotine
A rapid eye movement stopper, cancelling your dream
Im leaving threatening messages on my own answering machine
Hear my voice and it rakes, people sleeping in spain from the noise that it makes
Hanging in jungles trading venom with poisonous snakes
My words burn heated your head like a perm
I was murdering rappers like you when I was just a sperm
Your style is drafted while mine was brain crafted from God tactics
Subtracting active wackness with acrobatical rap back flips
You need nursing im bursting a verse when I heard cursing
Duplicate my body twice and start speaking in third person
I'm impossible to hit, start breaking your cycle quick
Defeating me is like a blind man tryna tackle Michael Vick
Turn the sound up, have a paroxysm and frown up
Reverse the game and make the rain travel from the ground up

We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
The Wizard, the Wizard, don't be fucking with the Wizard

In the beginning I had one Black Book, nothing more
But see one day I slammed it on the ground and it split into 4
See im greata then Montezuma, my name can cause a tumor
I was spotted on a mountain top studying scriptures with a puma
I smashed a golden calf with a staff and taught heightened math
My paragraph is sharp enough to slice light in half
Intestines blow when I face you bro
Magnetic flow, evil enough to scare the wetness from H2O
Rhyme dispersal is done without rehearsal
I rap against my own self like M.J. in that commercial
I drop fire like a space craft when it launches
Once it's started, I throw punches that leave planets unconscious

Big Z: You supposed to kick that rhyme about them cars

I was laying in the crib, aggravated and kind of bored
Picked up the phone, called this freak named Honda Accord
The kind of girl you can dog out and make her follow
She used to fuck with my homeboy named Monte Carlo
He used to be a pimp back in '84
With his clique: K-Rino, Trans-Am and Bronco
Shit got kind of deep so my boy went straight
But had to shoot this motherfucker named Z-28
Over this trick, that's when their clique ganged up quick
Went to Park Avenue and pulled a shife ass lick
Caught my homie Trans-Am and took all his goods
Then they slit his damn tires and left him dead in some woods
Now everybody know these hoes' grave is dug
Went and got the scoop from this dope fiend named Bug
Just give the boy some crack and he'll snitch like a ho
""Who killed my boy?"" He said, ""Yo it was Cutlass and 5.0""
Damn, now we all hyped and pissed
Ten detonators, a thousand units of explosives can’t get with this
Face crack and watch your back because we all packing
It's time to do some motherfucking Car Jackin'

If you run up you’re getting done up
If you run up you’re getting done up
If you run up you’re getting done up
So when you see us make sure you got your gun up

Hooked up with Samurai '98 and 6-4
Monte Carlo was the leader, so he said
""Anybody look like Cutlass or 5.0 just leave 'em dead""
On seconds thought Jack, drop that, bring him back”
Take all their dope, then get a rope and we gon’ hang 'em, Black
I know they're tricks, so let’s do 'em for their ladies
Go kidnap them hoes they love, Corvette and Mercedes
6-4 was a damn fool, Samurai packed a knife
98 can't go a week without taking a life
Yo, we knew if we wanted to get 'em back
We had to deal with BMW, Sidekick and Cadillac
See Cadillac used to pimp but when his status rose
Monte Carlo stepped in and took all his hoes
So taking these two gon’ be an easy play
We just fucked them, bucked them, dropped they ass off on MLK
Yo, he gave them both a letter that said our clique was better
Got questioned by a damn cop named Beretta
But he came up short because his evidence was lacking
It’s time to do some motherfucking Car Jackin'


""Who call the cops?"" Monte Carlo said and grabbed his razor
He took a grand to the police chief, his name was Blazer
Came to find out a snitch named Hyundai
Saw us when we picked them hoes up last Monday
Yo, we heard that Cutlass had 
organised a coalition
They caught my homie Jag and fucked up his transmission
They pumping us off fast, the cops just found a body
Watch the news, they came to find they killed my partner Maserati, damn
It's time, I'm tired of this, no more of this shit
6-4 said we moving too slow, I'm ready to fast forward that shit
Move 5.0 if we can't catch you, we gon' see your mom
Sent a message to him by this gangster ho named GL Storm
They sent the lady named Lexus, we ran game on her
Took the message she had then ran a train on her
She told us 5.0 went and hired a killer
A big old cocky motherfucker named eighteen-wheeler
We squared off in a field and we outlasted 'em
Cutlass was nuts and ran but Monte Carlo blasted him
5.0 and Cadillac they got it worst
The last car that they saw was the motherfucking hearse

On every journey, seem like the farther I go, the farther I am from where I'm tryna be
So maybe I'm going in the wrong direction
So I gotta set 'em straight in the 9-8
Yeah we gonna do it like this

15 rounds and the gloves to match
A lotta these fools keep dying for scratch
All I wanna do is get paid for good
But too many haters rolling through my hood

It's like, I'm tryna get from point A to point B
Motherfucking feds still watching me
I'm still on paper from my last lick
Rough street life got me pumped up to blast quick
2 o'clock on the block, I'm pulled over, damn it
I red light a mile back, the cop said I ran it
I ain't a slave to the grave, I just had to send him
Six shooter in my lap, I put five in him
The heat iron heat defeats novacane
To degrees where even death can't stop the pain
Gain momentum when the heat started dumpin in him
And then I'ma bit 'im like a snake when I'm pumping venom
The murderistic, realistic
Let my fist get deeper in his grill cuz I'm twisted
I'ma show you, all the dirt that K-Rino do
""Duck!"" You see the type of shit I gots to go through?
I'm trippin'

15 rounds and the gloves to match
A lotta these fools keep dying for scratch
All I wanna do is get paid for good
But too many haters rollin through my hood

It's like, I stepped in the mosque back in '92
Got the real scoop on the red, white, and blue
It provided me with deep thoughts to rap about
Ain't no choir 'cause it ain't shit to clap about
I had a dream I was in a shootout one night
Fool started cockin' up 'cause they was scared to fight
I tried to run but my feet couldn't handle the test
I felt a sharp pain blast right through my chest
I hit the ground tryna fight for what I had left
I felt the essence of my life removin' itself
My homeboy standing over me, cryin' and shit
I'm losing focus in my eyes, going blind and shit
I raised up, wooo, damn it was only a dream
Trippin over how realistic a vision could seem
Was I really about to be received by the dirt?
How come I woke up with that bloodstain on my shirt?
Trippin'

15 rounds and the gloves to match
A lotta these fools keep dying for scratch
All I wanna do is get paid for good
But too many haters rolling through my hood
(Knowledge)

In 1555 they put us on a ship
Thousands of miles across the water, that's a long trip
Strip the knowledge itself, devils flip the script
Rip the shirt off my back and commence to whip
Murder to he or she who fought for the right to be free
Raping the sister while they hung the brother from a tree
Burning the body of the victim to ash and dust
And at the same time teaching religion to us
Emancipation proclamation, they let us go
Only to make conditions worse than they was befo'
'Cause even though our asses are no longer in chains
They wrapped the motherfuckers smooth around our brains
Poverty stricken conditions lead to criminal shit
""We're equal now""...got your ass subliminal shit
If your great granddaddy could come from the past
And hear you bumpin' that bullshit he'd slam yo ass
'Cause just imagine how our first ancestors felt
Being deceived back in Africa, sold and dealt
They had to pay with their life for us to walk today
400 years later still ain't left point A

Shattered Innocence,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"May every child who goes astray
Eventually find their way, one day
Let's go

A happy man and wife, life worth while
Married two years then they had their first child
He was so excited though it was not a boy
His little princess soon became his pride and joy
Believed in family, that was his universe
She was brought up knowing God, raised in the church
She was sheltered by her father's safe ways
Elementary school to middle school straight A's
Couldn't tell it all this is just a summary
Everybody talked about how great she's gonna be
And she was on that path but no too far along
Now she at school seeing things she never saw at home
Class mates wild, starting trouble up
The other girls wearing skirts, she was covered up
Curious thoughts in mind she tryna walk the line
But now she wondering what she been missing all this time

Once it's gone all you can do is reminisce
Broken pieces of a young life shattered innocence
Before and after, then and now no resemblance
Hope and pray you never have to echo these sentiments

A change was happening slowly but who could tell
Tired of following the rules, started to rebel
She not the same girl her grades dropping off
Talking back, attitudes, mouth popping off
Her mama getting scared, what should we do then?
She at the school running with a clique of new friends
She they checked the room and saw a bigger threat
Found some weed and a half a pack of cigarettes
Tried to talk to her, she wasn't listening
So daddy implemented some physical discipline
Back to the old school, he put that belt on her
No abuse but he left a couple of welts on her
She told her home chick, ""I need to move quick
I done grew sick of this, my daddy too strict""
Tripping from A to Z, that ain't the way to be
Her friend said, ""I got the remedy, come stay with me""


Been out the house a month, her new life was deep
She went from school everyday to maybe twice a week
No more curfew now she can go wherever
He friend's mama real cool they all smoke together
Happy that she was free, no longer in solitude
Wild and rude, having sex with a college dude
That life didn't play around man, it took her early
Seventeen but them drugs got her looking thirty
But she so naive she don't regret her deeds
Her parents feeling like they never should've let leave
Now five months later the wounds are opened more
Happened to run into her father in the grocery store
Right at that moment then he saw his world end
She said, ""Daddy, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend""
He wondered long as he painfully drove home
""How could I do everything right and it still goes wrong""",https://genius.com/K-rino-shattered-innocence-lyrics
Administrative Leave,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"Now one little, two little, three crooked cops
Four little, five little, six got shot
Seven little, eight put nine in a box
Two shots a piece now that's eighteen mops
Time to clean my floors with some Mop & Glo
Got the homies from the streets and we shot some more
When the war pops off better shoot that burner
You can call me Brother Nip or you can say Nip Turner
Either one it doesn't matter cause they both some killers
Gangsta Nip came through and bought us both some pillars
Two crooked cops heads homie they inside
If you scared of the war homie stay inside
Hey, duck around the corner better hide your face
If you sprinkle some sugar it'll hide the taste
Administrative leaves, sometimes they have perks
Six months of pay for only one days work

They got a license to murder us
I hear 'em trying to explain it but not one word I trust
You get to go home to your family you wicked coward
We gotta go to the graveyard to visit ours
You finally popped you one
To you that seems to be funny
Your reward was a vacation with some free money
And in they mind they agree they can shoot any nigga they see
Cause they know that all that's coming is administrative leave

Even when the camera clearly shows that they did it
Mystically, magically somehow they get away with it
Kill somebody, get suspended, then get paid with it
Probably bought some dope and let the DA hit it
I can see 'em all plotting, planning, acting bad
And in the aftermath they all go in the back and laugh
A brother dead we can see that writing on the wall
And in most cases ain't no inditement at all
Then they try to tell that lie about the cops ain't racist
And if they do charge 'em usually they drop the cases
Protected by their homeboy judges who known to mob
Two or three weeks later right back on the job
Bucking, jacking, robbing, beating people up, no ducking, no dodging
Causing conflict then getting slapped on the wrist by the lowdown tricks in charge
And don't no peace come to the family of the person that they wipe out
They be still around there doing what they do living their life out

They got a license to murder us
I hear 'em trying to explain it but not one word I trust
You get to go home to your family you wicked coward
We gotta go to the graveyard to visit ours
You finally popped you one
To you that seems to be funny
Your reward was a vacation with some free money
And in they mind they agree they can shoot any nigga they see
Cause they know that all that's coming is administrative leave

Alright, check this out
I ain't gonna do no third verse on this one
What I'mma do right now man is put something on blast real quick
See, everybody knows the names of all the victims that got killed by dirty racist police
But don't nobody seem to know the names of the police officers and the faces of the ones who did it
So right about now I'mma go down the line and call 'em all out one by one based on the person they killed
Let's go
Alton Sterling was killed by a cop named Blane Salamoni
Tamir Rice was killed by Timothy Loehmann
Mike Brown was killed by that devil Darren Wilson
Eric Garner was killed by Daniel Pantaleo
Walter Scott murdered by Michael Slager
Oscar Grant was killed by Johannes Mehserle
Philando Castile was killed by Jeronimo Yanez
Samuel DuBose was killed by Ray Tensing
Trayvon Martin of course was killed by George Zimmerman
Sandra Bland was set up to be killed by  Brian Encinia
Rekia Boyd, Dante Servin is the one who killed her
He got cleared of all charges
Terence Crutcher was murdered by Betty Shelby
John Crawford killed by Sean Williams
Jonathan Ferrell killed by Randall Kerrick
And Aiyana Jones was murdered by Joseph Weekly
Listen, right about now all these names I mentioned
Find their pictures
Put 'em on social media man
Let everybody become familiar with their faces
So we'll know them when they're walking down the street
Cause right now they're just living their life comfortably
Feeling like they got away with murder
So that's your assignment
We ain't taking this no more
It's justice or else

Let's get it

Children of the Concrete,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Down went K-O, no time to lag
Last month he rode a bus now he rolling a jag
He picked me up around 6:15
He had just paid a fiend some green to get his shit cleaned
Got in the back with a smile on my face
Couldn't help but notice twenty five grand in a briefcase
Went to another dope spot, then we ran
Weapon in hand, made another grand, paid his clan
See I'll be jocking my boy cos he's striving
A freak in the car giving him head while we driving
Runnin' straight came never ever skimming
Seventeen years old straight pimping grown women
We hit the crib about 6:45
Watching the news, hearing about some punks that died
Found out they was the brothers from our street
They got beat now they 'Children of the Concrete'

Kill or be killed, kill or be killed
Kill or be killed, kill or be killed
Kill or be killed, kill or be killed
Kill or be killed, kill or be killed

Got there at 7 o'clock on the dot
After hearing the word three of my homeboys had got shot
Stepped in the place a cop on the case found
Ten dead brothers on the floor laying face down
In South Park don't nothing get squashed
Let's see how many brothers been popped at the car wash
Next thing you know I hear a round off gun shots, aw shit
These motherfuckers hit the curb for another hit
Jumped on the side of a house quick as a mouse
Realized I had my shit in a pouch, so I snatched it out
All of a sudden the shooting just ceased
Two girls standing by got stuck plus two police
I felt kind of bad that they got the props
I ain't gonna front, I was glad that they shot the cops
I stepped out feeling nervous and scared
Almost pissed on myself when I saw that K.O. was dead
I started crying cos I knew that was it
My first mind said, ""Let it slide,"" second mind said, ""Bullshit""
So when I catch 'em, school out and no retreat
Obsolete, 'Children of the Concrete'


Six months later K-Rino is ruling the scene
So fucking clean I don't touch nothing but green
I live in a condo out there on the rich side
Ain't been to the hood since K.O. died
I stepped in a club, well rested, uncontested
Gaming on hoes I used to mess with
Within minutes I had to put a sucker under
Punk got mad cos his momma had my beeper number
2 o'clock I get an ass invitation
Saw the dudes who popped my boy by the gas station
I pull the trigger with no pity
Now they selling six-packs of cold punkass at Fool City
At ten minutes after two there was three left
By 2:15, weren't nobody but me left
So now I'm riding the dick of a court appointed lawyer
For tryna be a fucking warrior
They boxed me up for a year then I made parole
Cops confiscated my shit now I'm snatching your gold
Then I sell it so I can score me some quick crack
Get fat and reaccumulate my shit back
Within a month I was back in the park
But had brothers slanging for me in 5th Ward and Honclark
But smoking moes had me froze cos I'm robbing my foes
Steeling clothes from them hoes while the money grows
Jumped a freak till she left with a swoll neck
Fucked her once and made her give me her whole check
Went to a spot two tricks had a dime, they were splitting it
They talked my stupid ass into hitting it
In three months my car was sold
Dead as a pole and didn't give a damn about gold
I used to be out in South Park dropping hoes
Now I'm out there holding up Stop & Go's",https://genius.com/K-rino-children-of-the-concrete-lyrics
Lord of the Worlds,No Mercy,1999.0,"How deep can a lesson get knowing eternal existence is definite?
Self-created lord of the worlds, ever-beneficent
Breaking the code, travel to the spiritual mold
My brain represents an atom when it cracks and explodes
Number 19, the sign, the ultimate signature
Triggered the galaxies, we mathematicaly figured the
Equation of its own universal creations
Formed from the same nation, the first generation's
Extinction of its mind with divine intentions
Wisdom ranging beyond man's comprehension
The plan, invented righteousness and spiritual wealth
Took the best part of his being, created his second self
The woman, the life giver, greater value than gold
One god behind the zero increases you tenfold
Life developing duality, so all could last
Created masculine and feminine and blades of grass
Actual fact is how we operate, no time to assume
The darkness of His universe corresponds with the womb
The same struggled process that brought about His own birth
Is the same we had to go through being born to the Earth
Standing alone in the space nobody witnessed the blast
Mastery overy creation makes him the first and the last
All things under submission so it follows its course
Knowledge filters down eternally but God is the source
Check it out

A fool listens to ignorance and swallows the hate
While I tackle a subject that the scholars debate
Wallace Fard Muhammad, 19 letters involved
One-nine, sign of Allah, that equation is solved
Over it are 19 says the book so be warned
74 Surah. 30 and 1st, Holy Quran
Break it down, 7.4.30, no games
Seventh month, fourth day, 1930 he came
The real son of man, Christ, the crusher, the sin-wrecker
Came alone from Arabia, holy city of Mecca
It's odd how some fools diss Master Fard
But you can always tell a tree by its fruit, praise the Lord
Raised up a messenger, despite all the plottin'
The honorable Elijah Muhammad first begotten
Departed but left one to finish the marathon (Who?)
Farrakhan, holding the spiritual baton
You can take it or leave it, truth is hard, understand
Told you two tapes ago that God is a man
Lord I need a hand to help me to my feet
Last days we living in, watch Allah bring the heat

Thick and Thin,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"This song right here
It's not for the ones who didn't make it
It's for the ones who did, I salute y'all, man
It ain't easy
To start on a journey, then no matter what happens y'all still remain
So again, salute

Met each other, made plans, fell in love, built families
Peace, war, struggle, pain, years later still standing
Had a lot of ups and downs, good and bad, off and on
Breaking up, making up, hurtful words, talking strong
Never lost ya passion or your internal hope
And no matter how tough it got you still held onto that rope
When most people slipped on the slope but jumped from the boat
Y'all foundation never broke and still today remain close
It's always good in the beginning, understanding and patience
But see when feelings start raising so do expectations
Had to learn each other's ways and make the proper adjustments
Kinda scared knowing everyone is not for the trusting
Haters hating from the sideline but y'all ain't listen
Family members, friends in ya business causing division
Arguments and disagreements, they was real but got fixed
So when we see 'em years later they be still in the mix so

Through the years, through the pain, through the drama, through the hard dates
Through the fights and arguments they with you always
Through the outside talking and the messy friends
Guess what? (What?)
Y'all stayed together through thick and thin (yeah)
Stayed together through thick and thin (stayed together)
Stayed together through thick and thin (I see ya)
Y'all still together through thick and thin
Huh

It’s hard to find somebody loyal who won’t ever flip or change up
The one who stayed down when financial problems came up
You was out of work but they took up the slack with nothin’ said
Never threw it in your face or held it over your head
When you don’t have your life in order, that’s a problem for some
They just see you for who you are and not who you can become
That word love, good to have someone who knows what it means
Stayed on your team when all you had was just your clothes and a dream
When help was needed, they’ll be on the way to save each other
Each one of you done did some dirt and still forgave each other
Got a connection so the jealous one’ll see y’all split
Got certain looks and inside jokes that just y’all get
Had some dysfunctional moments, yeah, you know it’s the truth
But any problems that you ever had stayed under that roof
A lot of folks didn’t approve of y’all relationship status
But long as y’all know what it is, people’s opinions don’t matter so

Through the years, through the pain, through the drama, through the hard dates
Through the fights and arguments they with you always
Through the outside talking and the messy friends
Guess what? (What?)
Y'all stayed together through thick and thin (yeah)
Stayed together through thick and thin (stayed together)
Stayed together through thick and thin (I see ya)
Y'all still together through thick and thin
Huh

They catch you before you can land, Superwoman, Superman
Been through all a few could stand
Might’ve even threw some hands
You don’t even know what keeps it going
What the hell is it?
Other baby mamas, other baby daddies, jail visits
All kinds of situations, AM to the PM
Sneakin’, checkin’ phones, side pieces in they DMs
The child they mighta had with someone else don’t even like you
The crazy ex who just won’t let ‘em go and tried to fight you
But you holdin’ on to claim that
Rollin’ on the same track
Got a crib, lived together, moved out, came back
Tore each other’s hearts out, attitude, smart mouths
Cussed each other out so many times that y’all done lost count
Had it worse, had it better, got two or three kids together
Fightin’, y’all ain’t trippin’, when it comes to that one, it’s whatever
From the outside lookin’ in, people wonder how y’all last
All of they relationships be playin’ out, that’s why they mad

Through the years, through the pain, through the drama, through the hard dates
Through the fights and arguments they with you always
Through the outside talking and the messy friends
Guess what? (What?)

Yo, K-Rino the rectangular hyper-
Active genius, creator of the rectangular cipher
South Park liver, ass-whooping giver
Lyrics cold enough to make a fucking snowman shiver
I don't listen to country soft rock or heavy metal
Rap motherfuckers I take to unimaginable levels
The abductor of fools ridiculous rhyme raper
Confiscating repossessed spirits, sell 'em hoes for paper
If push comes to shove that shove gon' lead to shooting
MCs die like old ass trees I'm uprooting
A contest I suggest not you get split
I battle 5 million sperm in the womb, so you ain't shit
All that you can do is hate me, your girl can only ride me
I got a microscopic scientist living inside me who guides me
I'm old school to the fullest fool, beatboxing and cuts
Walking internet, so log on K and download these nuts

K-Rino is the motherfucking heat branga
Hard-ass bomb dropper rough beat banger
To yo woman I'm that motherfucking meat a slanga
Hands up if you don't give a fuck, feel what I'm saying?

My skills are genetic, respected atomic bomber
Training started at 6 months of age by battling my momma
She taught me well (yeah) and every now and then I shook her
She was hard to beat but by the age of 5 I finally took her
Man, I'm tripping but still ripping
Subtract the whole by adding hands to heads multiplying an ass whipping
You're roasting me, knowing you ain't nowhere close to me
The organ relocator putting lungs were kidneys supposed to be
Reverse your parts, I put your lips below your waist
Give your mouth a shitty taste and glue your asshole to your face
I rise above petty shit and take a leak on it
Fuck a love song, I play a Dolomite tape and smash the freak on it
So hopefully you might get the flow for me
You're sweet as potpourri, openly wrecking motherfuckers vocally
You came at me rhyme after rhyme after rhyme
But like Jordan you brought your ass back one too many times

K-Rino is the motherfucking heat branga
Hard-ass bomb dropper rough beat banger
To yo woman I'm that motherfucking meat a slanga
Hands up if you don't give a fuck, feel what I'm saying?

Stand in your midst, I'm transparent you wonder were I went
Calculus tricking, the metric chemistry experiment
Allows me to vanish, I'm the wrong man to pick out
Lose my mind, bust in the courtroom moonwalkin' with my dick out
No, for sure, K-Rino go hard, I crush one
Like liquor, I'm pouring lyrics out my book before I bust one
Yeah that’s for all the homies that ain't here to witness
The wizard cerebrally scaring these assholes shitless
Let's battle for cash, but if you're broke I'll take amps
Lamps, credit cards, firstborns and food stamps
Man you're worse than 700 rude tramps with mood cramps
Recruit rappers then run they asses through lyrical boot camps
Disaster, man fuck living happily ever after
Retire my rap jersey and hang my mic from the rafters
I'm always in a cop's scope
Like wrestling, landing knee first on bastards from off the top rope

K-Rino is the motherfucking heat branga
Hard-ass bomb dropper rough beat banger
To yo woman I'm that motherfucking meat a slanga
Hands up if you don't give a fuck, feel what I'm saying?

I run up on the stage with urgency
And let my sack hang like skin after a bypass surgery
My arsenal is not accessible
You hate to see me like a fella picking his nose in the car next to you
I’m old school down to the bone
I still hit the booth and read my lines off the paper, not from the phone
I’m not tryna say that your way is wrong
But if somehow your cell crash or it lock up, your lyrics is gone
It’s well known, can’t trick me with them lies, please save it, mane
Before I make your face vanish like I’m David Blaine
What kind of locs you got on, K? Them say they lame
Sound like the stuff you wrote came out a newborn baby’s brain
Better hope I show mercy on your ratchet soul
I’m so cold I snatch the donut and kidnap the hole
I make you feel the impact of the blast
Now you’re salty like the top part of a daiquiri glass
I might bust your gut open and tell you what you ate for dinner
You made a bad transformation like Caitlyn Jenner
You anywhere close to K-Rino, trick please
Ripping MCs, beat knocking like Kenny Smith’s knees
If we jump you, nobody better try and help
So versatile I do a clique song by myself
I’m acting like I don’t hear ya ‘cause I don’t speak to haters
But make me mad, I beat your ass with a sweet potato
When I win, ain’t no friends, I’ma brag instead
And rub it in like cocoa butter on ashy legs
Dinnertime, no beef just pass the bread
I got hair growing inside my head, backwards dreads
Mine against yours, my verse’ll prevail
‘Cause I’ma beat ya to the punch like I was thirsty as hell
Yeah you could of been a legend, you was live in the street
But you peaked early like cheating at hide-and-go-seek
When I pop off, fans on your bandwagon hopped off
Rappers have lost touch like their fingers was chopped off
Quiet as kept, I’ma ghost him when he step
I’m ‘bout to lose it like a team down by 20 with a minute left
Shooting slugs at K ain’t smart, cuz
Like having a baby-mama that’s a child support judge
You wanna act like you standing in knowledge knee-deep
You a fake scholar, you don’t study, you just retweet
Gotta talk straight in case he don’t take hints
Created clever statements until confusion made sense
I’m the true leader; perfect—I don’t need a proofreader
‘Cause I’m tight like ya mama squeezed in a two-seater
Try to jump fly with me, I’ma stand up and jump flier
You gon’ see more foul play than an umpire
I work the late shift when I get the pad and write
I’m not a morning person so like that singer, I’m Gladys Knight
You kept talking and I told ya you should have stopped then
Now you in this mess and can’t get out like you was blocked in
You thought I wouldn’t show, now your face is looking twisted
‘Cause I’ma smoke you all day like I was cooking brisket
I hear your lines and can’t believe that you said this
Sound like you bought ‘em from a teenager on Craigslist
Listening to you, it’s obvious that you fraud as hell
Like dudes who snitch on a regular, it ain’t hard to tell
Row for weeks, I’ma a beast with a spoken piece
I’ma ruin you for life like a broken lease
You just an actor, y’all posing like you really hustle
Thought your name with Dave ‘cause all I ever see you with is Buster’s

I wakeup everyday with a newfound spirit
So every single word that I say I gotta live it

Yeah, I had a hard day yesterday
I saw the streets take another homie’s breath away
I’m on the couch letting slow sad records play
I’m blessed to say God got me so I never stray
Hey, they tryna tamper with my understanding
Frustration is my new companion
I just can’t seem to shake the way it treks through me
I go to sleep and wake up, it’s laying next to me
I’m like a hamster on a wheel ‘bout to flame out
I’m running hard, running fast in the same spot
I get dejected sometimes and go in hurt mode
‘cause my rewards ain’t equaling my workload
Your boy be strategizing all day
I get it rough, even my crumbs come the hard way
I’m self-counseling with music and some ball-play
All the time working on a mission I can parlay

I got a dream and a plan just to make it come together
 if I want my life better
A hard road ahead but I gotta keep going
No matter what’s said, ain’t no weaknesses showing
I’ve seen a lot of friends where my pictures got thinner
The losses that I had taught me how to be a winner
I wakeup everyday with a newfound spirit
So every single word that I say I gotta live it

Self-resentment and regret, those are my opponents
Don’t ya hate when people interrupt your quiet moments
They think that something’s wrong with ya tryna go for help
No offense but you don’t know me better than I know myself
I sit stoic in my focus tryna regrow it
So if I tell you that I’m good, just take my word for it
The things I’m dealing with currently, y’all do not know it
Been in the basement too long, it’s time to top-floor it
Every now and then I question if it pays to fight
I’m starting to wonder to myself, ‘Man, are the haters right?’
‘cause I’ve been waiting in despite, working day and night
It’s seeming like the success of chasing ain’t taking flight
But it’s aight ‘cause you got power over what’s destined
You can’t control what already happened, only the present
Throughout my life one thing has become evident
If you accept the lesson then the hurt becomes medicine

I got a dream and a plan just to make it come together
 if I want my life better
A hard road ahead but I gotta keep going
No matter what’s said, ain’t no weaknesses showing
I’ve seen a lot of friends where my pictures got thinner
The losses that I had taught me how to be a winner
I wakeup everyday with a newfound spirit
So every single word that I say I gotta live it

Nah, no matter what your disappointments be
Rejuvenate and start over the next morning free
Your dude left and you ain’t even get a letter from him
Let it go and just know that something better’s coming
Yeah, I know you goin’ through a rough season
But God takes people out your life for a reason
Realize you didn’t need him
You’re free now, get happy, take a minute and breathe in
Yo brother, you hurtin’? Feelin’ the blues strong?
You sittin’ home feelin’ crushed because she moved on
See it’s a time to begin and a time to fade
See you can’t make nobody want you once they mind is made
But tomorrow’s a brand new day nevertheless
Just remember loneliness is better than stress
Tough it out and you’ll see your life status improve
I’m thankful just to see the dates on my calendar move

I got a dream and a plan just to make it come together
 if I want my life better
A hard road ahead but I gotta keep going
No matter what’s said, ain’t no weaknesses showing
I’ve seen a lot of friends where my pictures got thinner
The losses that I had taught me how to be a winner
I wakeup everyday with a newfound spirit
So every single word that I say I gotta live it",https://genius.com/K-rino-new-found-spirit-lyrics
Two Roads,Danger Zone,1995.0,"It ain't but two roads that you can take
When you doing dirt to get the money that you make
I ain't gon' knock you for tryna get your mail
But all the true gangsters is dead or in jail
See boy, you's a fool, 15 years old
Thinking you gonna stack you up a killer bank roll
You used to have to scrape, now your crib is straight laid out
Started selling dope cause them crew cups done played out
The homeboys told ya but you didn't learn a thing
An OG even took you up under his wing
He said, ""The dope game is like a basketball team
Everybody got a role, we can't all be a king""
You got some kingpins, you got the little Gs
Some people sell rocks, while others move keys
You work your way up and now you're making all the bread
But you might meet the Feds or some bullets to your head
'Cause it ain't but two roads

The game is sweet but sometimes it's sour
High cappers getting bumped off by the hour
You take the high road, you take the low
You'll end up dead but you'll be on Death Row

I got a friend who started struggling, hit some hard times
Never been the type to indulge in petty crimes
Anywhere you saw him, most likely you could find me
I graduated 1989, he came behind me
But when he graduated, he started getting nervous
Mama said, ""You gots to get a job or join the service""
He thought to himself, ""Should I push up on KFC
Or join the army and be all I can never be""
Then he remembered that his partner said, ""Holla
At me any time you wanna make a quick dollar""
He kicked my boy down with a small lick to start with
Said that he would stop when he moved in his apartment
And get himself a ride, but yo, something happened
He started making bank, pulling freaks and high capping
He got to acting shife and people's dope he started taking
Now he's in the grave 'cause he crossed that Jamaican
It ain't but two roads

The game is sweet but sometimes it's sour
High cappers getting bumped off by the hour
You take the high road, you take the low
You'll end up dead but you'll be on Death Row

I ain't but two roads that you can take
One is the jail house, the other's the grave

Whatever happened to the days when a brother used to scrap with hands, and when it's over gave each other dap
Ain't no such thing as a one on one right?
A one on one is now a gun on gun fight
You had to get your strap and blast 'em in the chest man
'Cause your pride couldn't accept the fact he had the best hands
Now what's up with that? How we gon' stand?
Killing a man over a women, killing a women because she took your man
It's not that, it's some dope that's where her mind is
Time is running out, so really the bottom line is
That smokers gon' smoke and gangsters gon' shoot
But you can't kill a tree by cutting the branch, you gots to get the root
And that be the media on TV
Tryna blame the blacks for all the problems that they see
Yo, the politicians, you know we can't trust
‘Cause guess who they making all them new laws up for
Yeah, I see you blind but you can see
I'ma tell you just like L.V. told me
You got to cherish old folks and kids too
‘Cause you can teach the kids and old folks can teach you about them roads

The game is sweet but sometimes it's sour
High cappers getting bumped off by the hour
You take the high road, you take the low
You'll end up dead but you'll be on Death Row

I ain't but Two Roads that you can take
One is the jail house, the other's the grave
No I don't wanna see my people dying
No I don't wanna see you crying
Things are gonna get better
We need pull ourself together, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-two-roads-lyrics
Caught in the Cross (South Park Shit),K-Rino,1998,"I was born in the land of the shiest
The place where motherfuckers steal a piece of bubblegum and get life
Cops shoot to kill, they don’t love me
Kick the door down, asking questions but my mama lied for me
Had a partner who was selling bad crack
I’m staying at his crib around the time when the killers tried to pay him back
Busted in, charging fools up, tried to get him
I ain’t never sold no dope but I’m in it ‘cause I’m wit' him
He ain’t there, so I’m knowing that it’s doom
His little brother sleeping in the room, never woke up all you heard was BOOM
Is this the final stage for me?
I’m witnessing his son facing a pistol for the first time at the age of three
“Woah, please player let us make it
All I got it 20 dollars and a pack of gunpowder, take it”
But they ain’t faking and a flash shot proceeded
Finally made the front page but I didn’t live to read it

Welcome to the place where the killers hang
Shoot a motherfucker like it ain’t no thang
Brothers selling dope, suckers running game
Cops hating black folk and taking aim

I’m on the metro ain’t got no ride so I’m standing in heat
Warm up pants, hood out, Nikes on my feet
My homie rode up asked me which way I’m going
Told me to hop inside, “What up fool, you still flowing?”
We shot the breeze, laid back chilling in the drop
He said, “Hold up, wanna rush? I need to make a stop”
I said, “It’s cool” so we head to other side of town
My boy got out, gave me the keys, said, ""Turn the car around""
I’m sitting down about five or ten minutes passed
He ran out wearing a mask screaming, “Hit the gas!”
I’m tearing ass at the same time, tryna think
I seen some cats, damn this motherfucker robbed a bank
I was shaking, he was laughing when he looked at me
Said, “Wait inhaling, boy” and quickly broke me off a G
That’s when the HPD blasting so we blasting back
He met the graveyard but I’m meeting twenty flat


Can I touch ‘em with some South Park shit?
Can I hit ya with some South Park Shit?
Can I touch ‘em with some South Park shit?

Yo, I got this partner, he said he needed to talk to me
He knew this spot where some fools was dropping off a ki
Gat plus ski mask equals paid, fuck what you heard
We touching everybody taking money and the bird
“But I can’t pull this shit alone”, that’s what he said
""I need a back-up, somebody with a level head""
I owed this boy some scratch and he gon’ bump me if he get me
Let’s make the come up K-Rino and split it 50-50”
I said it’s risky, we might not make it through that shit
All of a sudden I heard a voice say, “Hey, let’s do that shit
“Man, that’s a car plus a crib fool, comprehend”
Gave him my answer in three quick words, “Count me in”
We pulled a move, jacked it smooth, came and locked the doors
While counting the money something said, “What if all this was yours
You got the gun”. I said “Yeah, but I can’t buck him
He put me down, he hooked me up.” The voice said, “Man, fuck him”
So I just thought about the situation, what to do
I didn’t know that his conscious was howling at him too
Telling him to do the same damn thing to me
He pulled the strap and beat me for the money and the ki
Damn


Now this is for the brother that got blasted with the pump
This is for that baby they found inside the dump
This is for the fool that straight clicked and lost his mind
This is for that sucker that got shot up thirty times
This is for the youngster that some police beat to death
This is for the girl that was depressed and killed herself
This is for the sister at the club acting wild
This is for that sucker that ran out on his child
This is for the neighbourhood that’s overcome with sin
This is for that killer doing life inside the pen
This is for that trick that stabbed his homey in the back
This is for that child whose mama strung out on that crack
This is for that sister that be setting brothers up
This is for the government because they been corrupt
This is for them perpetrators acting like they rough
This is for that.. fuck that shit man that’s enough",https://genius.com/K-rino-caught-in-the-cross-south-park-shit-lyrics
Don’t Know Why,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Hey, what's up, you ain't made nothin' to eat?
Hell no, I ain't cook nothin' for you!
Man, that's what I'm talkin' about right there, man
See, that's your problem, you always talkin' 'bout somethin'
Been workin' all day, can't even get a meal
Work?
I don't know why I even deal with you, man, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, you right, I don't even know why I deal with you either. I'd be fine by myself
Well you ain't lyin', I been doin' bad since I met you
You ain't the only one

Girl, I don't know why I'm still fucking with you
Man, I coulda been knocking down somebody new
I ain't the best lookin' dude but I catch women like the flu
Conversation, rumination, shit that's how I pulled you
I taught you class, common sense and mindstate reversal
When I met you you had some dukes on at choir rehearsal
And normally when you're low-down my mother'll bust ya
It was throwed off 'cause your momma told me not to trust ya
You ain't shit, dissing me, trickingyour money and scores
You talkin' about mommas, fool, you still living with yours
When I left you started stalking me, dressing in black
How you gon' sneak up on somebody in that ragged-ass 'Lac?
Talkin' about you struggling now, you wasn't shit to begin
To tell the truth, I only talked to you to get to your friend
Seem like every time I look around you begging again
Don't even call my name unless you got some money to spend, fool

I don't know why, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why, I let you stay in my life
I don't know why, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why, I let you stay in my life

I don't know why I'm still fuckin' with you
After all these years, I thought your little thing would of grew
Popping that bedroom talk, I should of knew it was fraud
You came in two minutes, it took you ten to get it on hard
You come home tripping, wanna argue and fight
But I ain't gonna argue witha ya, I'ma put them laws in your life
And you ain't getting none, so you can get your ass out the room
If you was the last man on Earth, I'd take my ass to the Moon
You ain't no angel, little mama, you fake
I saw you pulling out your titties on a beach party tape
You don't work, you stay begging like a bum with a cup
And you can't make a bowl of cereal without fucking that up
For real, being with you is just like doin' a bid
You kept accusing' me of knocking down your friends so I did
Going through my shit, finding old pictures I hid
You filed child support on me and we ain't got no kids

I don't know why, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why, I let you stay in my life
I don't know why, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why, I let you stay in my life

I tell you what, why don't you pack your bags and go and move out?
Ain't that some shit? How you gonna kick me out my own damn house?
My bad, just tryna make sure that you're still on your game
Like when we fucking, I fake orgasms and scream out your name?
If we was married, you would try to take half 'cause you hustling
If you had something, how can I take half of nothing?
When I left here there was three rubbers, I know this for sure
And I ain't been here since, there's one left, where them other two go?
I used them motherfucker as a matter of fact
I left it there 'cause I ain't think your ignant ass could subtract
Before I wake up to you every day I'd rather go blind
And if you ask me, you been on your cycle since '99
You need a case of Viagra boy so save that drama
You in the club old enough to be everybody in there' mama
And you lie too much, nothing that you saying is true
I love you, yeah, you know I love your stanking ass too, for real

I don't know why, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why, I let you stay in my life
I don't know why, I don't know why
Ooh, I don't know why, I let you stay in my life",https://genius.com/K-rino-dont-know-why-lyrics
Sharp Angles,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"I cut you like sharp angles, mutilated your frame
I unveil change that strangle the thoughts in your brain
The second that you aim, I’ll cover you in flames
And bring you to shame, increasing and doubling the pain
Cut you like sharp angles, mutilated your frame
I unveil change that strangle the thoughts in your brain
The second that you aim, I’ll cover you in flames
And bring you to shame, increasing and doubling the pain

You caught a jab when you ran in my slaughter path
Each thought I draft is harder to understand than a Arabic autograph
Swing with every part I have
Reverse your body chemistry and make you freeze to death
In a boiling hot water bath
Cast tsunami’s wrath if I have to
Make you announce your retirement twenty seconds after they draft you
The reason why men only use ten percent of their brain
Is 'cause within mine, everyone’s ninety percent is contained
I conjure images that frighten apparitions off my premises
Equivalent to a judge ‘cause I issue out death sentences
I hang with hallucinogenic menaces
Who produce infinite corpse-scented appendages that hemorrhage ’til the line finishes
Ran ‘em scared, the artist you thought was the man is dead
I swing hard enough to leave whips on you if I beat you with a strand of thread
Rap homicides beyond imagination
My method for eradication of a migraine headache is decapitation
The number of patients equal too many for tabulation
They’ll have to link two calculators up just to complete the equation
I’m extreme, my holocaust range is stretching
So far that the next scene is continued on a next screen
When I wanna be left alone, I angrily set the tone
Train my larynx to soak in ammonia and methadone
On the microphone, you need a chaperone
When it comes to spitting, you need to do what your girl did to you and leave rap alone

I cut you like sharp angles, mutilated your frame
I unveil change that strangle the thoughts in your brain
The second that you aim, I’ll cover you in flames
And bring you to shame, increasing and doubling the pain

I’m the warlock, the phantom that haunts your thought canyon
The mic’s my only war companion like a sword of D’Artagnan
I see nothing but you, my vision’s in tunnel mode
A remote controlled probe implodes your frontal lobe
Hit you with heart tasers, biting is audacious
Like dipping your head in hot grease and bobbing for sharp razors
I shred you into bodily confetti
They’ll find a sample of your DNA inside every beast of the Serengeti
I’ll rule with a rod of iron, the source of raw fire
Boss of a empire, I floss with barb wire
I slaughter and cast them into the gas of my audio chasm
Until my audio has ‘em in a full cardio spasm
My article depth is nautical, sparks that embark from my right metacarpal
Could set fire to a colossal bed of charcoal
Emcee rifler, cosmic media right stifler
The alternate universe entity code decipherer
The founder, the one-man school of shark surrounder
My counterpart was left with no parts left to counter
With a myriad of skill, I drill you and kill you with
Futuristic technology man is not familiar with
I’ve sparred with those 
With my mic as a Moses rod, they were all exposed as fraud
I cause body juice afflictions with proper use addiction
And double cross you like I was issuing two crucifixions

I cut you like sharp angles, mutilated your frame
I unveil change that strangle the thoughts in your brain
The second that you aim, I’ll cover you in flames
And bring you to shame, increasing and doubling the pain
Cut you like sharp angles, mutilated your frame
I unveil change that strangle the thoughts in your brain
The second that you aim, I’ll cover you in flames
And bring you to shame, increasing and doubling the pain",https://genius.com/K-rino-sharp-angles-lyrics
Sleepin’ On Train Tracks,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Ooh wee
Mommy, I wanna be like him when I grow up

I came back to flame that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks

Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks
I came back to flame that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks
Brain’s flat, explain that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks

When it comes to true spitters, no human can do better
I spell twenty different words using only two letters
You say that you solid, but can you survive through murder?
I’ll make you take orders from me just like a drive thru worker
My need for busting tracks proceeds up to the max
I’m so hyper that I have to take speed just to relax
I’m not swinging with my fists but I’m hittin’
Sometimes the beat just stops ‘cause it’s even tryna listen to what I’m spittin’, you know
No one can match my working load, every minute a verse explodes
Pen so fertile they tried to put it on birth control
The roaches came out then flamed out
I’ll put twenty thousand lame doubters on house arrest in the same house
I got volumes of unlimited evolving
This version of K-Rino is the most primitive installment
I strike and bruise, you wrong as two right shoes
I slice dudes with fighting tools and that’s usually when I’m in a nice mood

My eminence as a writer is still a must to see
When adrenaline gets excited it gets a rush of me
The writin’ fight trainer, consummate mic flamer, precise aimer
Able to maintain the water in a rice strainer
My specialty is treachery, they charged me with seventy felonies for selling these deadly heavenly melodies
Hell’a freeze over before I fail to please
Settle discrepancies so evil you’ll think that Thelma and Louise was helping me
No photo ops, listen, Xerox couldn’t copy this
Plus when I drop, they be feelin’ me like stop and frisk
Got that eternal green light so there’s no stopping this
So sit and watch what I can do to a track like opposites
I pinwheel ten fills and then kill for real
Have it raining steel, one drop shatters your windshield
And by the time the juices that ooze from your brain were through
My Uber had came and we cruised away grooving to Kool And The Gang

I came back to flame that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks
Brain’s flat, explain that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks
I came back to flame that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks
Brain’s flat, explain that
Playin’ with me is like sleeping on train tracks

Many years ago I got married to fresh flows
I got on one knee and proposed and carried my folder over the threshold
I see so far into the distance, G
That to me, three hundred years from this instance be lookin’ like ancient history
He said I’m out to kill his career, but I never tried
‘cause it’s impossible to kill something that’s not alive
There’s no random rhyme
I don’t like to write regular standard lines
I’m the kind of dude to dap you up then switch your hand with mine
Doper than most of his associates
I wrote a note to my own self that told me my poetry’s inappropriate
Insulted, I wrote back with vulgarness
And then several letters later, I concluded it was batter for us both to quit
Pen is loaded with oceans of cobra spit
The swollest lyricists get broken wrists for their bogus attempts of holding it
Connect your phrases to a respirator
Mine’s are born on blessed paper
Raisin’ up daily on an infinite escalator

I came back to flame that

What’s Your Purpose,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"Y'all gonna learn where your bread is buttered

Do we even need you? All you ever do is show your greed, fool
Why you bleed the people who feed you?
Many crowds you done weaved through
All the love you received yet you refuse to view them as an equal
From you they not gettin' no love, with you when you rose up
Now you see 'em an abruptly turn your nose up
They support you, you like ""so what"", in the club you post up
No regard for the people who purchase yo stuff
Arrogance inhabits such minds, do you not remember tough times
On the bus line, treacherous up climbs?
See initially you started cool, but broke true artists rules
And from the heart of you humility is far removed
Stupid men lookin' down on us 'cause of the shoes you in
You don't seem to comprehend what your success is rooted in
Let this play, who'll appreciate what I say
Just remember that God giveth and God taketh away

So what's your purpose, you climb that latter
But a day is comin' real soon when yo name is not gon' matter
Out of sight, out of mind, nobody bringin' you up
And now the same people you never love is stringin' you up
So what you sayin', K? Lets just kill him and get it over with
Hell yeah! Lets just kill him and get it over with
Hell yeah! Lets just kill him and get it over with
Right now, alright we got you

Hey, mister gangster rapper
I heard you spittin' about your Glock be rippin'
Say you run the streets why we don't see you when them cops is trippin'?
When it's time to stand up for the hood you real slow to speak
Always talk about pimping but you look like the hoe to me
You still trna claim you on the block but we don't see you here
You don't come back until you lose it all then you reappear
You ain't giving nothin' back but fakenss, you supposed to lift us
But you blowing 10 or 20 racks a month on dope and strippers
Our community goin' crazy and we tryna save it
But you won't show up for a cause unless you gettin' a payment
Don't wanna be around your people, I see what it is
A lot of y'all ain't have a hit in probably twenty years
Yet you still walking 'round like you hot with cash
Need to be glad somebody still notices your washed up ass
When you had a good, nose matched to the sky
We ain't forgot the way you actin' when yo status was high

So what's your purpose, you climb that latter
But a day is comin' real soon when yo name is not gon' matter
Out of sight, out of mind, nobody bringin' you up
And now the same people you never love is stringin' you up
So what you sayin', K? Lets just kill him and get it over with
Hell yeah! Lets just kill him and get it over with
Hell yeah! Lets just kill him and get it over with
Right now, alright we got you

You a blind fool, ain't nobody tryna find you
You 39 still thinkin' somebody gon' sign you
Years behind the time still trapped in the cycle
Old as hell, dressing like your nephew in high school
Business an art, you're not to confuse it
I never knew that everybody had a price until I got into music
Didn't believe it, I thought that you was truly a skill
It's real sad what some people would do for a deal
These labels'll milk you dry then wait for your son
You diss your fans but you kiss ass at Radio One
Writin' songs 'bout the pistols you ready to use
And how you whoop a hatin' dude yet you scared of the Jews
For sellin' out, its cost will leave you merked in the box
All these black coon entertainers working for fox
Real soon you gon' wished you would've showed your people love
'Cause we ain't looking for a autograph, we lookin' for blood

So what's your purpose, you climb that latter
But a day is comin' real soon when yo name is not gon' matter
Out of sight, out of mind, nobody bringin' you up
And now the same people you never love is stringin' you up

Longevity,Deprogrammed,2014.0,"See you in a million years
Longevity
I see you in a million years, that is if you still here

Say, some of y'all just are arriving
So I'm obligated to familiarize you with where I've been
Subscribing to the sacrifice is usually the problem
Surviving and even thriving in the game that's so conniving
The first thing that you should do, is make sure you
Study the history of artists who came before you
Their successes, their failures
See, there's a lesson in every message they tell you, don't let the stresses derail you
The next phase essentially is finding your identity in the industry
Be patient cause it don't happen instantly
It takes a lot of long nights
Make sure that when you song write, the words correspond with your own life
Then you might appeal to all ages
You gotta maintain the same flame when the game evolves and changes
You can last or be a one-hit wonder
Make the choice between being a sprinter or a marathon runner

Longevity, it ain't about what people seeing now
It's about how long will you be around
Never mind what you just made
Will you be relevant in a decade? Longevity
The game will chew you up and spit you out
Don't be that cat that folks forget about
Not everybody in this game is meant
Try not to be the dude who came and went

Definition of longevity
Means that folks will be steadily bumping you heavily even when you 70
Establish an eternal legacy, artistic equity
But long careers is what the average artist never see
Mastery of musical gospel
You don't want to be that hot dude today and next year people forgot you
The gift that God gave you keep feeding it
Increasing your deepness by reading and challenging your level and exceeding it
Accomplishments you had, gotta put those in the past
Never being satisfied with what you did last
No relaxing or chilling even after the checks cash
The only thing that matters right now is the next task
When they say your new project's your best, get mad
Then go back in the lab and surpass yourself fast
The key is to reap your skill and still keep it real
You last forever when you drop music that people feel

Longevity, it ain't about what people seeing now
It's about how long will you be around
Never mind what you just made
Will you be relevant in a decade? Longevity
The game will chew you up and spit you out
Don't be that cat that folks forget about
Not everybody in this game is meant
Try not to be the dude who came and went

Claiming the real state that you can drive in the earth
Do insert yourself and multiply your body at work
When you're writing to save people with intelligent flows
The more you connect with them man your relevance grows
Yeah we want cash, but it's bigger than having some ends
You gotta be able to see past the fads and the trends
In the conversations of greats I'ma consistently be
I want my fans' grandchildren to be listening to me
From my new music all the way to back in the days
And in my old age let them wheel me out on the stage
I want my hand to write every great creation it can
I thank God for the many generations I span
Last but not least, you doing good business, you maintain
Lifting one shoe out the game, quick as having a bad name
If you tough enough to fight through the failures you get stronger
Be the people what you want them to be, you'll stay longer

Longevity, it ain't about what people seeing no
It's about how long will you be around
Never mind what you just made
Will you be relevant in a decade? Longevity
The game will chew you up and spit you out
Don't be that cat that folks forget about
Not everybody in this game is meant
Try not to be the dude who came and went",https://genius.com/K-rino-longevity-lyrics
Both of Y’all,Mightier Than the Sword,2018.0,"From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
You can blame it on her, you can blame it on him but nah
From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
It’s both of y’all
Both of y’all

You say you gave her everything, bent over backwards
But you forgot to mention that time you slapped her
She put you on child support ‘cause you dismissed her
But you forgot to mention you was knockin’ down a sista
You got mad at him, said you was leavin’
You only hooked up with him ‘cause he was the weed man
You told him you was in love and you shared his vision
You got with his best friend when he went to prison

From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
You can blame it on her, you can blame it on him but nah
From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
It’s both of y’all
Both of y’all

You mad ‘cause your woman told her friends you lazy
You ain’t work since 2013? You crazy?
Now she won’t let you see your little son, that’s cold now
You only gave him money twice and he nine years old now
You told your man no matter what you’d accept it
But the second that he got laid off you left it
You told everything that was said in private
Did something to his ride so he couldn’t drive it

From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
You can blame it on her, you can blame it on him but nah
From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
It’s both of y’all
Both of y’all

You see the bills on the table but you won’t pay one
You been stealing money out her purse since day one
Poppin’ up at her door, straight messin’ the mood up
In the kitchen, eatin’ all them children food up
Baby-girl always gettin’ mad for nothing
On a date, straight catchin’ attitudes and cussin’
You had a good dude who was showin’ ya love now
But ya kicked him to the curb ‘cause ya wanted a thug now
You told your girlfriend your ex wasn’t  right
She went through your phone and saw that you texted last night
Naked pictures all in your inbox, that’s absurd
Read every single message ‘cause she found your password
Your friends tellin’ you how to run your relationship
Hopin’ y’all break up ‘cause they can’t wait to build
You told that man that baby was his though
The DNA said 0.0%, no!

From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
You can blame it on her, you can blame it on him but nah
From what I see it’s both of y’all
Yeah it’s both of y’all
It’s both of y’all

Ya’ll Can’t,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Yeah, I want all y'all to line up, I'll tell y'all something
Stepping to me like y'all can get some
Teach you motherfuckers a lesson, uh
This how we do it in South Park and H-Town
Let me tell y'all something, man

Y'all can't fuck with Point Blank and DBX
A.C. Chill, can't forget about J-Flex
Rhyme Felon, Murder One and K.O
Ganksta NIP, Klondike Kat, PSK and K-Rino, uh
Y'all can't fuck with Dope-E and Ruff Eyque
Texas Tech, Greek and Catch-22
Street Military, X-Man and Egypt-E
Brain Dead, Rapper K, Ice Lord and T.P
Y'all can't fuck with Lame Bang and C-Rock
20-2-Life, D-One and Big Doc
Aftermath, Soul Provider and Big D
Grym Shadow, Ikeman, Volero, Se7en and G.T
Y'all can't fuck with K-Water, Victor Slick
Shadow Mob, all the Screwed Up Clique
Big Tyme Records, Wicked Crickett and Kuwait
Before you step you better ave your shit straight

Man, I'm a time traveler, I might be in the past looking
We got new technology, I'll email you an ass whooping
I stand up and call a man's bluff
Amputated his arm but still managed to put him in some handcuffs
A rapper thought he had me killed
I came out of the casket blasting 'cause I left him 20 shots in my will
Getting steel, you must not be in your right mind
You need to let your wife rhyme while you sit at home looking at Lifetime
I fucked your grandmother's daughter
You ought to try giving your rhymes by aerial, flows might get harder
When I speak, let it be known you up that creek without a paddle
Man, picture me shadowboxing with another motherfucker's shadow
You wanted to follow me, so let's go
Your ass couldn't bus a rhyme if you put one on the metro
Fool you so weak it's hard to sum up
You could be on your back with a freak riding you and you still couldn't come up

Y'all can't fuck with a sharp killer with a strong mind
That'll make you draw out your own chalk line
Don't give a damn about how many partners you bring
Me and my Black Book by itself, that's a two man game
Y'all can't fuck with ammunition that won't miss you
And I ain't got to make an underground to diss you
The header banger, weak ass MC hanger
Rip a show and leave with your old lady if you bring her, fool

Ain't no escape from your tragic fate
You locked your doors, thought you was safe but I was hiding in your chest plate
You want my skill but you ain't there yet
Feel like I'll never lose my nuts but if I do I've got a spare set
Words I lease 'em, while victories I increase 'em
In my bed, it's me, your girl and my folder having a threesome
I get tipped u like tricks do dancers at strip clubs
His mouth's slick 'cause I ripped off the part where his lip was
I plant the best seed, whenever I read the rest heave
Sink my teeth in lady MCs and breast feed until their chests bleed
I invented and represented a forensic rhyme clinic
Fool, your life is like a cellphone and you just used up all your minutes
See I'm a psychic and I don't play ho
I slapped your ass before you spoke 'cause I knew what you was about to say, ho
There words you say ain't effecting K
Your rhymes turn me off worse than your lady wearing her negligee

Y'all can't fuck with a flow that'll slap your face south
Swing at your mouth and knock the taste out
The Southsider that never bored shit
Eliminating frauds and still dropping that hard shit

Knocked up your girl and left her perm bent
The baby came out of her hair so that tells you where the sperm went
Smashing scary men, I'm mashing every win
My alter ego beat the hell out of your imaginary friend
When I blend my style send a shock wave to your dome, sinner
Treat your girl like a bank and deposit my bone in her
Uncovering, opening gashes in cerebellums, I'm loving
You got as much chance against me as a Popsicle in an oven
Man, I'm tired of all of y'all showboating and high capping
You spit so much shit I thought your asshole was rapping
In the game you came soft so I'm squaring the game off
I might not be off the chain but I'll snatch your chain off
I'm the only one you'll see in the crowd
I'm already underground so when I die bury me in a cloud
My skill's sharper, battle my words like old vodka
Flows tighter than some size 2 panties on Nicki Parker

Y'all can't fuck with the South Park Coalition
One rhyme against a tonne of ammunition, ho
I blast tricks with agg words, fuck a gun
Got your old lady bobbing her head in more ways than one
Y'all can't fuck with a flow that will leave your head swimming
Turning dikes back into real women
Coming with skill while you coming like hoes

Misery Loves Company,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Boy, I done told y'all, stop lettin' them old sad miserable people drain your power, let's get 'em

If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
‘cause misery loves company
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
But not me

It’s like they know you tryna win
So they wanna put you in that messed up box that they already in
Sit around all day and they just watch your every move
Instagram, Facebook, got ‘em all running hot, peep the things you do
I told you when you got dreams, guard ‘em and freeze your mouth
‘cause you got people who listen just to plant seeds of doubt
What you give them and what they give you never evens out
You seek to travel the world and they never leave the house
The same people who say they with you but they quick to lie
They don’t want you to put in work, they’d rather get you high
They take your mind off of your mission through their own volition
‘cause they feel better when they pull you down to their position
Externally they play it off inside, they hate your thoughts
Be cautious of artificial smiles and fake support
Secretly evil in their hearts, envy plays its part
They plan to set fire to your plan the day it starts
Listen, you wanna know why?

If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
‘cause misery loves company
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
But not me

Sad stories out of their mouths is a habitual sound
They say they down with you but every time they with you they down
When they single, they want you to be single, homie, that’s wrong
See some lonely people just don’t like being lonely alone
Whether morning, noon or evening, when they call you they grieving
Negativity weighs on you when that’s all you receiving
Gotta break away from ‘em fast, get free at last
It’s like the only thing that makes ‘em happy is being sad
And it’s been goin’ on from the first moment they known you
Every single day they phone you just to dump their problems on you
Most of it is fake depression, I’m stressin’, it gotta chill
Got me counseling these cats like I’m the ghetto Dr. Phil
I ain't tryna bathe in dirty water, hers or his
Complainin’ ‘bout the same problems for the last ten years
Hard to rock with your view on life ‘cause it’s so jaded
Leanin’ on my shoulder so hard that it’s dislocated
You know why?

If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
‘cause misery loves company
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
But not me

If I come to your home and you startin’ to pout then I’m gone
How come you always call me when the game is ‘bout to come on?
Yo, you don’t have any happiness but you can’t take mine
I done sent you the voicemail twenty-eight straight times
You left twenty-eight messages all heated and stressed
I listened to the first two then I deleted the rest
You’re steady whining, expecting me to sit through it all
I can’t give you my energy, you need to get you a dog
I don’t get too involved ‘cause it’s never fixed or resolved
Notice you hear them out, but they don’t ever listen to y’all
You try to cheer ‘em up, it don’t work, every moment is low
You try to get ‘em to hang out with you, but they don’t wanna go
When you say “oh” and then dip, they question your friendship
It’s crazy how lazy ungrateful women and men flip
You can’t lay around all the time and smoke like them
They want you frustrated, depressed, hopeless and broke like them
You know why?

If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
‘cause misery loves company
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
If they ain’t happy, they don’t want you to be
But not me",https://genius.com/K-rino-misery-loves-company-lyrics
Lookin’ At You,Alien Baby,2011.0,"I got my eyes on you at all times

K-Rino is looking at you
Everyday I'm looking at you
You can't see me but I'm looking at you
Everyday I'm looking at you
(Tell me what'cha see)
I see you when ya hating and ya scheming okay
I see what'chu be thinking when ya dreaming all day
Wishing you can penetrate my matrix hell no
I tie em up and let em watch me count my mail slow

Whoo! Ya never see me no money no deal
Murdering rappers in the streets like road kill
Had a dream I was killing you it was so real
I heat em up in two minutes like oatmeal
Half-robot half-alien mammal
Slakin up the hustle (the huts soft?) a camel
Talkin to animals on my CD panel
Slap your teeth out from a 3D channel
Hit 'em up with two lines and need the whole place shook
How the hell you goin bang on Facebook?
Check the message I'll promise it will send shocks
I left 25 shots in ya inbox
Running after money the cellular sun hit me
Even go get it back in one jiffy
Sell em with his homies with regular come and get me
But didn't know I carry a nuclear bomb with me
Plus if I can read you'll probably never get it out of me
I don't need Twitter to make the world follow me
Gotta see a dollar cause I'm allergic to poverty
When I see a nigga I try to hit it like the lottery
Slow down I need a breather (whoo)
I'm a G he's a diva
You say that K ain't moving platinum units you ain't either
Everytime I hear you rhyme I feel like I'm in Toyland
You not hard you need to give up rap and join a boy band
You need all sorts of meds
Challenged and lost his bread
Stay commercial I stay underground like a ostrich's head

K-Rino is looking at you
Everyday I'm looking at you
You can't see me but I'm looking at you
Everyday I'm looking at you
(Tell me what'cha see)
I see you when ya hating and ya scheming okay
I see what'chu be thinking when ya dreaming all day
Wishing you can penetrate my matrix hell no
I tie em up and let em watch me count my mail slow

Let me tell you how the whole thing happen
Thirteen songs back you removed the plastic wrap from the album prepared to hear me rapping
You let the songs play all the way checked out each one, you love 'em
Even rewind at certain lines to check the genius of 'em
You bought your copy from the store I hope you like it G
And I remember you you bought yours off the streets from me
And what's up dude yeah you been down for years support consistent
You ordered yours for me online that's real man thanks for listening
But something's wrong I feel some tingling in my spidey senses
Some of y'all are listening to this under false pretenses
I don't see my album cover, I don't understand
I see a burned CD with my name written out by hand
Now what's the deal man you ain't paid for that you shouldn't have it
Don't act surprised or try to lie fool I'm looking right at it
You stole my music them the kind of moves I can't condone
And you right there don't burn this for your partner, tell him buy his own

K-Rino is looking at you
Everyday I'm looking at you
You can't see me but I'm looking at you
Everyday I'm looking at you
(Tell me what'cha see)
I see you when ya hating and ya scheming okay
I see what'chu be thinking when ya dreaming all day
Wishing you can penetrate my matrix hell no
I tie em up and let em watch me count my mail slow

Ain't nobody live as me (live as me)
I run up and invade you like privacy (privacy)
Mess with me at two fifty nine and see (wassup)
I guarantee that you won't be alive at three
I'm in your phone line stopping your connection
I'll be in the mirror right behind your reflection (that's me)
When you start to panic I'll evaporate and vanish
But not before the permanent psychological damage
My third eye pictures the infinite forecast
I see right through your body as if it was made of glass
I see you when I'm sleeping in the dark in a blindfold
And you don't see this invisible weapon that I hold

I Got 5 On It (Economic Blueprint),UnKnown,2013.0,"I got 5 on it, brothers, sisters, family
I got 5 on it, help your nation to be free
I got 5 on it, time to build our unity
I got 5 on it, freedom, justice and equality

No cash, so broke it ain't funny, black
Everybody wondering where the money at
Looking to the government, you should be done with that
Cause this economy is dead, no coming back
We can be free tomorrow, we just don't know it
Been here for centuries and got nothing to show for it
We chase paper, even hustle on the low for it
Muhammad got a program, we need to go for it
Simple solution to wipe every expense away
All you gotta do is save 5 cents a day
No, I didn't say 5 dollars or five 20's
Or 500, I said a nickel or 5 pennies
That's all it takes to get this thing cracking
Asking for jobs is played out, that ain't happening
Before the fall of America hit ya
Invest in your own future, it's a whole nation with ya


See, Farrakhan said it's time to live independent
No more ignorance and frivolous spending
Religious lines, our unity should be transcended
You tryna cling to a world whose life's fast ending
Following stupidly, no more excuses, G
The truth be, if you're poor it's cause you choose to be
We can do it and create our own reparations
Preparation for separation, no trepidations
We gotta stop blowing money in this hell zone
24 inch rims and two cellphones
Cigarettes and liquor, clothes and petty jewels
Video games and 200 dollar tennis shoes
Fast food, drugs, movies and tattoos
We don't own nothing but big debt and bad moods
A trillion dollars we working with, that's power, black
You telling me we can't take some nickels out of that?


Now let me break it down to you real sweet
A nickel a day equals 35 cents a week
Multiplied by 52 weeks with nothing spent
Means in one year, that's 18 dollars and 20 cents
Per person, so now let's go to the next stage
It's 16 million of us earning a wage
Multiply that by the 18.20 we saved
365 days, $290 million made
A nation established, ours where everybody paid
Independent, no more begging for financial aid
Owning land and our own resources to trade
And from only 5 cents, that foundation was laid
Now everybody got a chance to advance
Legitimate school, somewhere to live 
and farm land
And that's real freedom for the original man
No more knocking on Master's door, sticking out your hand",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-got-5-on-it-economic-blueprint-lyrics
Somethin’ On My Mind,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"War'll start when I spit lyrical martial arts
They sought their thoughts and approach me with cautious hearts
Feel this, hello God, it's me again
Asking you to forgive my transgressions
Thanking you for all you do, not just for me but for your whole Universe
So with that being said, it's K-Rino again
AKA the Black Hole, AKA the Thought Breeder
AKA the Octagon, know in some planets as the Mind Killer
Sent here to dwell amongst mortal men with concrete thoughts
And raise nations with the depth of my lyrical translations
For those who misunderstand me, this is my MO
Love come natural but when it's hate that's in my direction
It's returned back to sender tenfold with no affection
So feel that, here I go

It's time for me to put these bars in line, time to make fools respect my grind
I'ma bore your skull and disect your mind, which one of you cakes is next in line
I'ma wreck you tricks without even trying, slit my wrists without even dying
I'ma pass by  what the fuck you signing, hit your ass with the first thing I can find
Oh and lately I've been receiving hate, hope you fools don't believe in fate
I'ma suffocate him 'til the hethen shake and leave your whole state not breathing straight
Reverse the game and make your mind go left, make you write a verse and diss your own self
If I swing I bet you couldn't stand one lick, I bounce you like a  doing Air One tricks
Time for K to teach class today, blast your ass until you pass away
There was mass array but I was still kind of mad because I wish I could have took him out a faster way
Everyday I spray until your pubic split, like a freeway cross me and you get hit
He was wiped out quick that he wasn't even knowing, he was bruised up and we was on the telephone flowing

Something on my mind, thinking all the time
Keeping it real with every line, staying on my grind
I got something on my mind, thinking all the time
Keeping it real with every line, staying on my grin

Oh, you want a verse, how much loot you wanna chuck, on the mic you can't get non like a monk
He ran for his gun, I laughed at the punk, I got a whole penitentiary sitting in my trunk
Fake MCs got the criminal pissed, only hoes do a subliminal diss
You wanna write some shit but won't call a name out, scared to let them know who you talking about
I'ma listen to your words distinctively and mob on your ass if you think it's me
I'm so confident on the mic in fact, that if you beat me boy I'll smoke some crack
I'ma finna kill the calamity, come and study the man I'll be, examine me
Wanna slander my family and damage me when your favorite MC came up jamming me, boy

Something on my mind, thinking all the time
Keeping it real with every line, staying on my grind
I got something on my mind, thinking all the time
Keeping it real with every line, staying on my grin

You can see my picture, I'm standing froze, next time you see it I'm in a different pose
Wearing different clothes I delete my foes, one of my pages contains 10 different flows
Cut you in half like a deck of cards, when the blood rush my whole body get on hard
You wanna flow with the master, the answer's no, wouldn't put you on track boy if you was a ho
When I talk, I scare the Laws and wear your ass out like a pair of draws
I'm beating MCs down with a whooping rope, you couldn't out rock me if you was cooking dope
My mind holds the capacity to massacre man like Butch Cassidy
The faster he run, the better his head roll from the clothesline move when passes me
Watch K-Rino expose the way the dude flows, win or lose ain't scared to take a few blows
Radio, I got nothing to say to you hoes, it's messed up rappers got to pay to do shows
When I come I'ma hit him in the grill, if he bring homboys I'ma get him in with the steel
Reveal my game until I make the whole world feel us, South Park Coalition the definition of skills

Something on my mind, thinking all the time
Keeping it real with every line, staying on my grind
I got something on my mind, thinking all the time
Keeping it real with every line, staying on my grind",https://genius.com/K-rino-somethin-on-my-mind-lyrics
Never Give A Freak,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Yo, huh. I gotta come agg this time. They ain't hear me last time, yo. But if it don't apply to you, don't get offended. Don't come in my face wid it. Check it out. Give it up, hoes

Never give a freak your money
Never give a freak your last
Never ever let yourself get beat down
For a nasty piece of dried up ass, yo

Uh, this freak tried to crack my plate
Let her keep my car in August, didn't see it till May
Pulled up in the yard, I was having a fit
Cause she had a dope fiend cold drivin' my shit
Yo, I would have fought but then I said, ""No
I'd rather live for a woman than die for a ho""
Yo, I used to kick her down with half my checks
But now she's so broke she wearin' used Kotex
I stepped up cool and ran them both off the street
Saw two or three used rubbers in my back seat
Went back inside the crib, phone rung one time
Some trick had a baby and it's mine, now lets see who's lyin'
This motherfucker better have my look
Or either that he better be born with a Black Book
But when I saw him I said, ""Please!""
She must have fucked Bruce Lee cause it was half Chinese, yo
Now she's tryna get herself a fat paycheck
You looking for a settlement ho, have a wedding, shit
She had the nerve to try to take me to court
But I won so now the trick pay me daddy support, so


Think it's a joke, oh yeah you gon' laugh scrub
Until she drain your pocket out like a bathtub
My ex gal was so bad, that just to get cash
She'd make me break a damn nickel in half
Nap ya straight and knock fake, I'll give and take
Bank of love won't hesitate to donate, yo
She couldn't tell you the meaning of true love
Cause her and her mamma used to dance at the Q Club
The game you're playin' is an old sport
Tryin' to play K you'll get ran like whole court
You can check every freak I molest
And find dried-up ice cream and milk on they chest, yo
Asked for money, it alarmed me
Bought free clothes and take yo' ass to the salvation army
I attacked her in a frenzy
Hit that ass in '88, didn't nut till last Wednesday
Heifers catch bad mood cramps
Whatever you do, don't lay a finger on her food stamps
Because you might get your face stroked
Ain't no fun bein' in love when you're broke

Break it down for me

To me freaks are like chicken, on breast and thighs I'll feast
Four girls with two titties each, shit that's a eight piece
K-Rino is not a pimp or a mack
But put some speakers on my jock it could pass for a 'Lac
Yo, I knew this trick who liked to have fun
Scum bum that had a baby every year since '81
Skin was soft I used to love to feel her face
Titties so big one could fill up a pillow case
She was a rookie but now she's a pro
She could show you some shit that Bo don't even know
Yo, she got some kids but yo don't blame 'em
Blame it on the eight or nine daddies who don't claim 'em
Try to play a brother for his tens and twenties
So he cold DDT'd her ass in front of Denny's
Now she got a new man I know he ain't sour
But how the fuck y'all living off two dollars a hour?
Yo, pitch black is how you spending your nights
Wear new clothes but sitting in the crib with no lights
Tryna play me like a fiddle

Knockin’ Heads Off,Deeper Elevation,2012.0,"So much hood in my DNA, I gotta give one for every hood around the world
We gone bump this one all around the planet. They ain't gonna be able to stand it. Come on

Listen to me now, I stay chasing and lick hard
If you owe me I take cash, jewellery and wick cards
Walking pneumonia flow man I got sick bars
Hook my brain up to a TV you might get Mars
I run perfect, and never will I short circuit
Why would I bring sexy back when I'm the one who murked it
Every time I hit the scene it's straight gasoline
My mind is tripping I got issues like a magazine
I be knowing what you 'bout to say before it's spoken
No holes barred I go in like the door was open
K-Rino I'm still homiciding any beat
Still got love on any street, still wet from 20 feet
S.P.C. you ain't seen my whole staff yet
Got right jabbed and stretched long as a giraffe's neck
My last set made two slabs and a cab wreck
I ain't got it all I'm playing with half of a half deck

So watch that swanging hand, we knocking heads off
Weaving through these streets trying to knock some bread off
We ain't saying nothing, you tipping the feds off
My word play is like letting a round of lead off

I hear them talking, but they ain't said much
Best believe you talking down, or you will get touched
This is music homeboy, yeah we living forreal
Having Sniper on the beat like we flashing the steel
Come on. It's one reload today
Straight to the grave when I'm pumping the gauge
Lyrics can kill, showing no mercy fortunately tough when I'm all in a rage
Lock an load is my way of life
Pay the price, and I earn my stripes
Spending with ease
I'm cool with the words
M-16 with a 3 round burst, better disperse
I ain't playing no games
Keep the game lit 'till I burst into flames
Hit em' in the high, hit em' in the low
Every other rapper is stupid, so we know they name
I ride with the killas, known gorillas
On top of the game, and we out for scrilla
Short fuse, and I'm about to blow
With the pistol in yo mouth, what you scared for?
One day you here, one day you gone
It's 25 years still holding strong
We H-Town, Houstone. By your city in Screwston
S.P.C. we the first click
S.P.C. we done changed the game
S.P.C. we ain't going no where
Murder's the case, and we to blame

So watch that swanging hand, we knocking heads off
Weaving through these streets trying to knock some bread off
We ain't saying nothing, you tipping the feds off
My word play is like letting a round of lead off

Head to head, mic murders done without a witness
Watch me shut the game down like it went out of business
I might get upset, but I'm never mad
If you had one of my bad days
It would be the best day you ever had
Ain't no surprise I'm still riding with the most high
And those guys with the bean pies, and the bow ties
You couldn't win with three hundred and eighty four tries
The bread maker head baker, watch my dough rise
Man please my talents, you wish you had these
My skills keep you from elevating like bad knees
I stay moving with precision loading flow clips
Meanwhile y'all slipping like tennis shoes with no grip
Before you think of rushing in, you better wait my friend
Weapons extend even my two by fours are eight by tens
So now I guess it's time to mash out
If you rolling through my hood
Please don't pull your cash out

So watch that swanging hand, we knocking heads off
Weaving through these streets trying to knock some bread off
We ain't saying nothing, you tipping the feds off
My word play is like letting a round of lead off

Yeah, for my gangstas, for my hustlers
Everybody out there trying to get it the right way, God's people. Shout out to the homie Clip-D, R.I.P. to my brother AC Chill

You came in the game with intentions of fame
They gave you some paperwork they never meant to explain
Ignored those before you who went through the same
Showed you the slave sheet and then you penned in your name
With no representation, you got no protection
No voice or translation to stop the deception
But that was the motive, the moment that they wrote it
Knowing cars and jewelry is all that you notice
At first you was bangin’ and underground famous
But due to the arrangement, your art starts changin’
The hard fought painstakin' flames in your language
You’re far from the same that you initially came with
All lost in the moment quick
Your likeness and your music are both under new ownership
But when you fall, you're no longer a guest here
They'll drop you and sign another one like you next year

The label CEO is talentless
He's only enamored with the construction of financial imbalances
90/10 split means the pay is low
Only a snake would justify this disproportionate ratio
Rappers are hoein' for Lyor Cohen
And other Jews who represent themselves to be all knowin'
If it was up to them, artists wouldn't get one dime
Made millions off of rap and never spit one line
Who controls entertainment and makes it a weapon?
Sumner Redstone, Michael Eisner and  Levin
, dictators of all communication
Own the record labels, media and tv stations
Interscope, Universal, Turner, CNN
MCA, MTV, all belong to these men
CBS, ABC and NBC too
Are run by those who worship money so they exploit you, c'mon

Our music is being bled, the integrity's dead
Top rappers gave up self-respect for bread
But you don't care about the culture ‘cause you got yours
But what you think they say about you behind locked doors?
Yeah, you can blame the artist for negative songs
But who's the puppet-master that's lettin' these records get on?
They only sign you today if you buffoonish and foolish
And when they do this, the hood starts to mirror the music
Heavily influence whatever they rappin' we do it
And it was planned by an enemy who already knew it
Why we only hear about dope, jewelry and hoes?
Why you think all of these rappers wearing female clothes?
It's on us to separate, then break that phase
A lot of ‘em that's in the door got raped both ways
If they can keep you in a daze, turned up and lit
It'll stop you from exposing their corruptive shit

Gaze into my eyes all you see is dead people
I wear my stripes like a bulletproof sweater
Live my life and pray to God he help me change for the better
I run from nobody and a fear no evil
Gaze into my eyes all you see is dead people
Kill all the toughness in the street and collide
I hold my nuts into my body and my spirit divide

I'm old school, handle my business alone
See, I was here before you came and I'll be here before you gone
Tryna pimp me and win, men and women tempt me to sin
Let's murder each warden in every state pen, empty a pen
I peer in the do', bust shots and leave men on the flo'
These days it's hard to know which is your friend or your foe
Contemplating my final fate since I was 7 or 8
How come people are scared to die if they claim Heaven awaits?
I start chasing and run until I find my place in the Sun
Fear nothing or no one even if your facing a gun
You fear the unknown but life is more scary than death
The way people dying, when I go I'll have to bury myself
I'ma bang on a fraud, maintain then remain to be hard
Until my spiritual essence returns back to the God
Until then, when you all witness I bring power instead
And I don't pray for me enemy unless I pray for his head

I run from nobody and a fear no evil
Gaze into my eyes all you see is dead people
I wear my stripes like a bulletproof sweater
Live my life and pray to God he help me change for the better

Come on Down,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"(*talking*)
Yeah Chalie Boy, K-Rino let's get em

I'll drag you 'cross the water, from Houston to Israel
I'm a seven course gourmet feast, you a kid's meal
Take a sledge hammer, and damage the frame of your Caddy
Embarrass you, and make your own kids ashamed of they daddy
The people asking you questions, you answering none
Out of the trunk, selling mo' junk than Sanford and Son
You thought testing was a smart move, now you feel dumb
Like the Texans stupid ass, for not drafting Vince Young

You opened the door so here I come gunning, no time for no battlers
Me and the Time Traveler rattle ya, with a perammeter
Batter ya boy let's chatter yuh, leave you for scavengers
Adding you to the long list, of dismissed wanna-be challengers
Haven't ya realized yet, all that talk make me aggressive
Dig in your chest bring the broad out you, like some kind of decongestive
Material imperial mind, your flow is reposessive
It ain't the fact that you're whack black, I'm just very impressive mayn

Come on down, to Texas partna
Tight flows, or anything you need we got ya
Serving you, Southern hospitality proper
But know this, you step out of line we drop ya

The chorus and rap singing, a Don is
Verbally I astonish, get you hooked on my phonics
K-Rino spitting that plain flame, I soulfully punish
You trapped in a web's game, and into the eyes of who's punint
Locked down we run it, hands down no question
6'4 with a 5'5, wild child mic molesting
Bark like Mr. Smith, bite like Wesson
Professor ay step up, and get taught a top flight lesson

I laugh at ya, K-Rino the paragraph smasher
Catch you eating, snatch the food off your plate and won't even ask ya
If we bet who raps can outlast, you'll be a cash passer
One of the first, still one of the last of the ass thrashers
I'm down with Chalie Boy, if he call me I'm in his corner
Twenty thousand yards away, take off sprinting and run up on ya
I vacation in my own hood, keep the Bahammas
We got mo' flows, than a welfare office got baby mamas


I break a microphone is half, like the leg of Joe Theisman
If words was rushing yards, I would probably win the Heisman
Me temp is rising, your chance of survival is barely breathing
You telling lies with your hands on the bible, you damn heathen
I verbally, and verbally capture ya
Hit your car simultaneously, word slapping the driver and the passenger
You talking like a pimp, but you steady tricking homes
I be on your gal all night long, like a Cricket phone

Etching my name in history books, walking amongst legends
A part of a coalition, Texas ghetto street reverends
Chargers the game like Tomlinson, send you packing like Levans
Have you struggling to survive, like James and Florida Evans
Darkness about to set in, prepare for the on start
Shaking like a child fooling with a pit, just got his arm caught
You weak I ain't say that, that's what your mom thought
You bring a threat to me, like them nuclear bombs Sadaam brought none",https://genius.com/K-rino-come-on-down-lyrics
Stories From the Black Book Intro,Stories From the Black Book,1993,"Once upon a time in another dimension better known as the South Park Zone
There lived a strange motherfucker who loved to be alone
When it came to the rhymes he had never been a sucker
Just a twisted ice cream and milk eating motherfucker
Never been a mack or a gangster doing bullshit crimes
Though he's been known to kick some rough yet nasty-ass rhymes
Concerned with the negative ways of his town
Yet determined to keep that old South Park shit around
Yo, knocking the world off again and again and again and again
Words digging deep enough to give your asshole a twin
Will there ever be peace in this land of ice cream?
Or am I just a character in somebody's fucked up dream?",https://genius.com/K-rino-stories-from-the-black-book-intro-lyrics
President K.,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008.0,"Were standing here live in front of Wings N Wings here in Third Ward
Where local rapper K-Rhino will be holding a press (K-Rino man!) conference to announce his candidacy for
President of the United States
Let's go in and see what he has to say

""K-Rino if you were president, what would you do?""
I'd make a national holiday and dedicate it to Screw
Throw a major concert at my inaugural speech
And block parties at the Whitehouse every two or three weeks
Do the same thing on the inside whenever the winter comes
And spray South Park Coalition on top of the Pentagon
I'm a beautify these ghettos and clean up the streets
""What's your campaign slogan?"" You don't hustle, you don't eat!
I won't need no secret service just my gangsta committee
""Who's gonna be your first lady?"" I'll have one in every city
I ain't gonna have no vice-president, I'm a run it without him
""And what about Osama Bin Laden?"" (hahah) what about him?
All the homeboys on lock well I might as well tell
I'm a let the inmates out and put the police in jail
And boys won't have to sell dope no more they'll get what they need
And please no more questions asking if umma legalize weed

I'm bout to be the president straight out the hood
Ain't no fronting or no lying if I say it it's good
I'm a get this thang popping like it's supposed to be
You wanna G up in the Whitehouse then vote for me

""Can you address the deficit?"" Huh, well how can I say it?
I ain't the one who built it up, so don't expect me to pay it
""What if the economy slips down and we hit hard times?""
I'm a take this suit off hit the streets and get on my grind
And I suggest y'all do the same be glad I told it to y'all scrubs
I ain't gonna change, I'm a still be at the hole in the Wall Club
""What about this picture of you scene at a known strip joint?""
Let me see that, yeah that's me aight, okay what's your point?
I'm a meet with Middle East Leaders till all the problems get cleared
Give them ten of my albums they'll give us oil for the next ten years
Meet with Congress, in a white T warm-ups and tennis
And pull up to the U.N. and slab bumping on twenties
We in the Whitehouse mobbing laying on silk and satin
And members of my Cabinet in the oval office playing Madden
Address the nation with a girl on stage holding a gage
And still got pictures of fine women on my MySpace page


""Is there a plan for the homeless situation in effect?""
Yeah, every Payday we gonna take a dollar from everybody's check
So if a million people got jobs and the city is beat
We can put the homeless on feet that's a million a week
Before I go on any further, I'd just like to state
That I apologize for slapping my opponent in last week's debate
But he was running ya boy hot, try'na bring up my vices
And asking me about unemployment taxes and gas prices
I'm a straighten all that out man, just give me some time
I'm a be the first president with his own clothing line
I'm a wipe out welfare, and put it under the dirt
If you can run the streets then party, your lazy ass can work
And any beef between nations, this is what'll be done
We'll let the leaders of both countries fight, one on one
So vote for ya boy, and we gonna make love not war
I can be no worse than these bastards we done had so far

I'm bout to be...",https://genius.com/K-rino-president-k-lyrics
Triflin’, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Woah, we gon’ send this one out to all the people who ain’t doing nothing with their life, haha
You know who you are
You laying around right now doing nothing listening to this song
Eating somebody else’s food

Ain’t got no goals in life, you just sit on your stairs
Don’t even wash your clothes, won’t even comb your hair
Not tryna help yourself, that’s how you wanna live
But you’re still unemployed, living at your mama’s crib
You told your son you broke, man you’s an evil dude
But you just left Poppa Doughs—paid for five people’s food
You got your income tax but never checked your bills
Went to the mall and spent two thirds on clothes, the rest on pills
Your partner loaned you money, but you ain’t grateful, black
When you got on your feet, you never paid him back
You say that you a soldier, but you ain’t got no honour
You got 4 babies now, ran out on all their mamas
Don’t even got no car, damn sure don’t own no house
Your woman working hard, you at home on her couch
Homeboy, you 35 but roaching like you 2
You’ll beat your woman up punk but you won’t fight no dude

Because you trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling
So what?
Let me tell you about these women out here

Your homegirl lost her man, you told her let him go
As soon as they broke up, you was knocking at his door
You say your money big, but girl you broke indeed
Don't even like that dude, just tryna smoke his weed
Your man work hard as hell, best dude you've ever seen
You lay around all day, never cooking, never clean
Then you bring your girls around and gossip all night long
Then when he leave your ass, you acting like he did you wrong
Ain't got no etiquette, girl you're so rude and loud
At the grocery store wearing them shorts with your whole booty out
You got on Section 8 when you was young and fit
But now you 42 and fat and you still on that shit
You let dudes in your house even when your kid's around
You told them fix some noodles, close that door and lay back down
Somehow your hair stay done, I know but I won't tell
Your children looking like they homeless but you're clean as hell

Because you trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling

You say that you a thug, you say you run these streets
But you ain't never did no work, partner—you young and weak
You like to bully people because you're soft and dumb
You're scared to used your hands, partner you'd rather use your gun
Little mama you need a job, but you won't trip ‘bout that
You base your life on how them women don't love and Hip Hop act
You lie about going to school plus you pretend you work
You at the dollar store sneaking items in your purse
Dude all on Instagram, you fools don't even think
Posting them pictures of your pistols, drugs, weed and drink
Won't teach your kids to read and homie that's absurd
But when them nasty songs come on they singing every word
See you be lying, steeling, scheming, you's a triple threat
Walked in your door at 4am smelling like stripper sweat
Ain't got no bank account but acting like a boss
You got that brand new iPhone but yet your lights is off

Because you trifling, you so you so trifling
You so-you so trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling
You so you so trifling, you so you so trifling",https://genius.com/K-rino-triflin-lyrics
Perfect Union,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Your strength is your beauty
Your beauty is my weakness
I'm inhaling your calm to exhale the journey of my dreams
The flight upon which I sore shall sow so carry me beneath your wings
Stretch me wide across the open fields, plant memories inside of me
Cropper our thoughts in unionism, harvest our future
Through many obstacles I stand
An infinite bond we maintain and a gap we connect

They were raised as friends bonded since the age of ten
The truest form of admiration they were stationed in
Where feelings died and fakes pretend they would break the trend
Become one being and unmistakable sacred blend
This was so authentic years later no break or bend
Showed appreciation with the garments he draped her in
Communicating for these statements just to make her grin
It never gets old each day a new first date begins
They took some losses had to cut loose a few hatin friends
Confusing but losing is part of what it takes to win
Love making, neither one of them had partaking in
Stood on a mental foundation the rest was paper thin
The carnal mind degenerates and then migrates to sin
Believed in love that inner faith was never tapering
His homies telling the man 'it's great don't hesitate your in'
But this one's worth the wait and God blessed his patient men

I'm perfect union lust from the beginning
Time will strengthen love that's never ending
Growing building fearing no pretending
We were made for us
Praying still discovering and learning
Will be here and us no longer turning
Vibing laughing flames forever burning
We were made for us

Nothing sparks greater emotion like that first romance
Picture two people separated by circumstance
To get her back into his world he said he'd search the lands
To relocate her and re-pursue her was worth the chance
She moved away and every single day he thirst the glance
Miles of distance had interrupted his perfect plans
Instead of getting down to the root of why he cursed the branch
The end result left him feeling just like a worthless man
It hurts to think he never take her down to the church and stand
Before the creator say vows person to person and
Finally consummating danced at universal dance
Conceive children who conceived and give birth to grands
He let love go and love re-sprouted like surface plants
Thought he was dreaming when he saw her, mind you murse than trans
His sweat glands overreact when she inserts her hands
The cultivation of thoughts make god's unearths advance

I'm perfect union lust from the beginning
Time will strengthen love that's never ending
Growing building fearing no pretending
We were made for us
Praying still discovering and learning
Will be here and us no longer turning
Vibing laughing flames forever burning
We were made for us

I was on a fast-pace collision course with nothing solid and reach
But with you I found peace
In you I know what a best friend is I know what a soul mate is
And you I found peace
You have abundants of knowledge with a heart of a champion
And a brain to match you
Know me in and out and not scared to check me and put me back on track
I call you my better half, I do the math
Your everything and more what a man can ask for
Your my queen
We've been friends for over 21 years and that's really knowing each other
Thirty draws each other flaws and who steals all the damn covers
But I love her always
Willing to help out others for my two sons who have no biological bond
Yet bonded with her as their mother
Though were young with nowhere near restless
Our love is bigger than just Houston Texas
It's your conversation your personality that makes you such a blessing
I love you
My girl's a ride or die woman from corporate woman to freak show
Know everything about me from my account numbers to pin codes
Sex ain't love and money don't mean success
You can be paid but what's the point if there's no one to share it with
It takes God, patient, trust, hard work, sacrifice, respect her all the key
No need to dip and dap, I love what I have
When your love is pure and your conscience is free
When your love is pure and your conscience is free
When your love is pure and your conscience is free
I love you my queen",https://genius.com/K-rino-perfect-union-lyrics
One Foot In,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Man I know I coulda been better, still could be
It's just that... when you out here man, it's about making money, not excuses
One day I plan on being able to be aight

Listen it's hard, you might not wanna receive this from me
I wanna leave the streets but I ain't tryna leave this money
Born with a silver spoon, shit, boy, you got me laughing
I'da been happy if the spoon I had was made out of plastic
Now I'm grinding, society completely denied me
Couple of tattoos on my face, man, these people won't hire me
Lawmakers doing plenty dirt, lying and cheating
You made this plate so now you wanna lock us up just for eating
And deep inside I know it's wrong, I won't say that it's not
But even still I say a prayer before I step on the block
And keep my head upon a swivel, see that's normal for us
We living in hell so you best to look to heaven for trust
Even my girl be stunting on me when this money surroundin'
Seem like I come up short everytime I ask her to count it
Taking chances with my freedom just to make me some change
Young money-getter feeling like I'm trapped in the game

I know I need to slow it down (I know I need to slow it down)
I know I need to get on now
But I still got one foot in (one foot in)
I still got one foot in (promise, man, I'm tryin')
I know I need to go another route (need to go another route)
See it's hard for me to get out now, that's why I still got one foot in (yeah)
I still got one foot in
Yeah

Riding 'round strapped, aggravated, gun in my lap
Got two strikes up on my head, the next one it's a wrap
And everyday I visualize myself locked in the joint
Sometimes I think and wonder how I even got to this point
I could've did something different with my life if I chose
But seen the older G's showing off they jewelry and clothes
And had to have it, not listening to my mama or preacher
The only time I went to school was when I'm serving my teacher
For this money ain't no telling how I'm liable to play
On top of that I just found out I got a child on the way
So now it's really on, nine months later he here
And me not being in his life's the only thing that I fear
I gotta flip this thing around and I eventually will
But other than moving this work I never learned no skills
So what's my option? 'cause mentally I'm tired of this grind
But still my actions don't line up to what's inside of my mind
You see

I know I need to slow it down (I know I need to slow it down)
I know I need to get on now
But I still got one foot in (one foot in)
I still got one foot in (promise, man, I'm tryin')
I know I need to go another route (need to go another route)
See it's hard for me to get out now, that's why I still got one foot in (yeah)
I still got one foot in
Yeah

I started tryna think of other ways to bring ends through
But when my money started falling off my friends did too
I thought about going to school and picking up on a trade
But see my son and baby mama they need money today
And plus my conscious started messing with me, stressing my nerves
Because I'm seeing what this dope doing to people I serve
And now the light is on in my head, clear is my vision
I done seen plenty of my partners dead or living in prison
And I'ma travel down that same road if I don't release
And leave my child with no guidance in these treacherous streets
That fast money's an illusion, and we all gon' learn
But when you livin' day to day it's hard to think long-term
And if you tell a young cat to stop hustlin' for bread
Make sure you got another option you can give them instead
Because if not, they'll just turn around and laugh in ya face
And they'll resort to what they know just to survive in this place
You see

I know I need to slow it down (I know I need to slow it down)
I know I need to get on now
But I still got one foot in (one foot in)
I still got one foot in (promise, man, I'm trying)
I know I need to go another route (need to go another route)
See it's hard for me to get out now, that's why I still got one foot in (yeah)

I got pimped by a freak now I'm broke to my name
I got pimped by a freak cause I had no game
I got pimped by a freak who took all my loot
I got treated like a motherfucking prostitute

Yo, I was a special kind of fool
She went to class on a brother so I dropped out of pimp school
I was like a Ready Teller, giving cash
Jack me off and made a twenty dollar bill shoot out my ass
Yo, her name was Cynthia Tucker
She had two kids, she couldn't read, but she was finer than a motherfucker
I get paid Friday, trick Saturday, we bust it Sunday
I'm running around broke and starving like Al Bundy
Her wardrobe was uncanny
Hundred dollar shoes, hundred dollar bra, hundred dollar silk panties
It was never nothing left for me
300 dollars worth of shit on a five-dollar heiffer, G
(K-Rino, I want a leather purse)
""Ain't nothing but a thing, just let me get my ends together first""
Woo, I'm broke again
I gots to find a Nation woman when I get right
'Cause back then I got pimped

I went to jail back in 1990 for sellin' dope
(Did you think your gal would mess around while you was in the pen?) Nope
That's what a lot of brothers think (Yeah)
Soon as the judge handed me my time, that bitch was at my bank
There was no doubt about it
I had an American Express card, that ho wouldn't leave home without it (Damn)
Sittin' in a cell, mad as hell, cause I was livin' fast
She told me she would wait, in two weeks she was givin' ass
My homies told me 'bout that line of dudes outside my do'
Just like the corner store, except they called it Pop-N-Go
While Rapper K was doin' hard time in the slammer
She was fuckin' two or three brothers on video camera
She sent me one picture, oooh, she's lookin' fine as hell
Another inmate had that same picture in his cell (Damn)
I couldn't let that shit get to me
But damn, how could it be? The bitch pimped the pimp of pimpology

See, you can't ever let a bitch know you're satisfied, you understand? Cause if a bitch live in an apartment, you used to a townhouse. The bitch live in a townhouse, you used to a condo. The bitch live in a condo, you used to a high house. The bitch live in a high house, I'm used to a two-story. The bitch live in a two-story, I'm used to a mansion. The bitch live in a mansion, I'm used to a motherfuckin' castle",https://genius.com/K-rino-i-got-pimped-lyrics
Lyrical Behavior,K-Rino,1998.0,"Time set, count down the massacre, design a new threat
Load a lyric in a pistol and play Rhyming Roulette
Opposition crucifixion, voice arose from the deep
Battle ten lyrical scholars, beat ‘em all in my sleep
Brain evolving like the Universe, words come with a spark
Pitch black room, I’m meditating, writing rhymes in the dark
Merciless interpretations, scriptures moving in motion
Volcanic vocalism, sparking flames beneath the ocean
Each line's scolding, pour it in my head and let my mind hold it
Time told it, ran across the freeway blindfolded
Cause suspicion, men jump and boast, I stopped your mission
Fatal decision, fought my own ghost for competition
Out of Body Experience, Mind Controlling it
Picture my pencil, writing down words without me holding it
South Park’ll run you through the ringer
It be more fighting everyday inside my hood than on Jerry Springer",https://genius.com/K-rino-lyrical-behavior-lyrics
The Long Run,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"Some of y'all boys got expiration dates
Starting to smell a little bit
G's like us, we in it for the long run
Last forever, watch

Now what happens in the hood, stays in the hood
Unless a few snitches make their way through the hood
It's G code homie all day in the hood
Never ever ever spoken but it's always understood
We like it laid back, old school in the deck
Cats ride around still blasting cassettes
Better watch your back partner when you cashing your cheque
When you see them goons coming boy your ass better check
Packing automatic weapons that will make your head spin
They got love for me from the North to the Dead End
All the women be complaining there's too many scared men
My hand itching bad time to put some bread in
Better miss me with that game because I ain't a dough tricker
Hustle through the day just to make it go quicker
I'm the solo mic ripper, I ain't sipping no liquor
I'm the one who flows sicker, River Oats dope kicker

'Cause we in it for the long run, for the long run
We chasing after paper till we can't see the Sun
Keep your eyes open in my neighborhood
I'm knocking the game down you can have it when I'm done

Worldwide respected for my ghetto work ethic
Barely get to sleep because my schedule's too hectic
The laws do us bad when we out in those streets
I guess that's why police rhymes with no peace
I move quickly can't let these bops get me
But I still take my time like I brought my watch with me
I spit it for the hood I ain't like them pop sissies
You's a damn liar if you say I ain't in the top 50
People still talking and denouncing where I'm from
Tell me why my name keep bouncing off your tongue
'Cause you know that you ain't ever brought an ounce of what I've brung
Just three or four more months of counseling and I'm done
I know the game good, I don't need to try to coach me
As long as you showing love, it's cool to approach me
Make your money work for you study game closely
75 will get you 150 worth of groceries

'Cause we in it for the long run, for the long run
We chasing after paper 'till we can't see the Sun
Keep your eyes open in my neighborhood
I'm knocking the game down you can have it when I'm done

I'm tired of being broke, I need green like that gecko
Pockets so empty, if I scream it'll echo
Talking about swag but you living with your mama
We don't tolerate dudes walking around in pajamas
G's bar none, I'm delivering your issue
I came by myself, you had your whole clique with you
Ran through them boys like some wet toilet tissue
Then ran them off the corner like a one man militia
We building up stacks and them cats can't match it
We picking up speed and them rats can't catch it
Babies in the store all dirty in the basket
It ought to be against the law to be so damn ratchet
Huh and I ain't tripping on swangers
I'm tripping on the judge downtown trying to hang us
I meant it when I first said, I ain't never stranded
Got a place to lay my head in every city on the planet

Cause we in it for the long run, for the long run
We chasing after paper 'till we can't see the sun
Keep your eyes open in my neighborhood
I'm knocking the game down you can have it when I'm done",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-long-run-lyrics
Steering Wheel,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"It’s a thin line, decide who you’re choosing to keep close
Who do you follow and who do you leave? Most
People indeed may wanna see you succeed
Though that just may be some people evil, it don’t
It’s those who schemin’ and actin’ like they need you and say
“Follow me this way,” take heed before they lead you astray
Beware of snakes tryna take away the things that you’ve made
Deceiving and speaking behind the fake smile on they face
Too many cases of our young men and women falling victim and losing sight of they vision
Listening to fake friends and gettin’ in all kind of predicaments
Including but not limited to sex, drugs, dearth and imprisonment
Discipline it can take to keep the right people around you
Who make sure you steer straight down the pathway
Far and away from the dark ‘cause er'body around you ain’t always got your best interests at heart

A bunch of  nothing that you hear is real
Your own folks turn on you like a steering wheel
Envious and jealous is how they appear to feel
Backstabbed you yesterday, today they in your grill

Cutthroats and turncoats, fake partners who flip the tables
And traitors that forsake us are only some of the labels
Lifelong bond friendships gettin’ broken like leases
Loyalty shattered to pieces when the heat level increases
What lesson does it teach us?
To each his own but when he condone speaking on me in the wrong way I’m speechless
You worked together, did some dirt together
But the minute y’all get jammed up, you’re looking at a stress, they be the first to sever
Mouse poison like pesticide
Same guy that you would ride forever with today you hardly recognize
Gotta hide from fake affiliates with Fed ties
And females cut ya loose when your bread dies
An actress, she killin’ Katharine Hepburn
No signal, out the blue just made a left turn
They try to hang a dark cloud over a man’s head
Nobody knows ya when you’re down and out like Sam said

A bunch of  nothing that you hear is real
Your own folks turn on you like a steering wheel
Envious and jealous is how they appear to feel
Backstabbed you yesterday, today they in your grill

I ain’t feelin’ these marks
‘cause they hate and despise
They camouflage their jealousy but it shows in they eyes
A fake smile is a frown when turned upside down
And they quick to be talking down when you’re not around but they cowards
And ain’t no love for these fake ass ni**as and I’m tellin’ ya
Don’t surround yourself with these cake ass ni**as
Get your shine on, get your grind on and them h*es gon’ 
Steady puffin’ on good kush ’til you’re blessed and your mind gone
But stay real, never turn fake on real patnas
‘cause when you in trouble, they come on the double, and it’s for sure that they got ya
But one thing about a real ni**a, when you cross them, you lost them
So speak your words wisely and make moves with precaution
 games for the youngsters and the children to play
And what’s so real about life, you can always have it your way
So you might be fooling the world but you ain’t fooling yo self
And hatin’ on a real playa just might be bad for your health so steer right

A bunch of  nothing that you hear is real
Your own folks turn on you like a steering wheel
Envious and jealous is how they appear to feel
Backstabbed you yesterday, today they in your grill

If you need me, I gotcha, call me, I’m there in a jiffy
Hit me, I promise you got a problem, I handle it swiftly
And you won’t owe me for nothing homie, just do me the same
And be down for whatever in this dirty dubious game
I got the streets sowed, dope game on lock
Gangbangers respect me, and h*es they gon’ flock
Haters they gon’ hate but mane, I hope not
When this sh*t go down, my ni**a, I show-stop
Yo you speak with a forked tongue and ulterior motives
Hold up, I betcha I can’t tell ya better than I can show ya
I can walk with ya, talk with ya, ride with ya, jive with ya
Walk to your , when you get back, you’ll be a lot richer
F*ck it, I know you wanna do the right thing
But let me gon’ tuck ya up under my right wing
Or you can drive with your  hand and take control
(Ya trust me, don’t ya?) ni**a, do you or (sell your soul)

A bunch of  nothing that you hear is real
Your own folks turn on you like a steering wheel
Envious and jealous is how they appear to feel
Backstabbed you yesterday, today they in your grill",https://genius.com/K-rino-steering-wheel-lyrics

I couldn't think about it
How can I help
Better the situation looking through a pair of angry eyes
Ready to face the nation
I'm not a mental patient
I have a little patience
I always considered that I have to have consideration
If I ever plan to over exceed expectations
I saw  with no hesitation
Then walked away with no explanation
I got to become better
Woke up, had a revelation
Forget the reputation
Building up stronger relations
Like an underground 
Deeper conversations
Startin' at the bottom, repairing the foundation
It's some poor people down here who need our motivation
Then clean out the big house
Startin' with the legislation
You should be non-biased with your rules and regulations
Now why you waitin' so long to givin' that compensation
You should punish yourself, that's a total violation

When will it get better?
All the time we keep askin' when
The day we stop hurtin' each other, I'm imaginin'
'Cause that's the only way we gonna regain what we had again
I wonder what's gon' make us stop all of the senseless merkin'
'Cause preacher's sermons, mamma's tears, and rap records ain't workin'
You think a youngster ready to go shoot up his rivals turf
Gon' sit around and let you tell him 'bout a Bible verse
Bein' straight up with him, that's the way to reach him greater
After we show him a better way, we can teach him later
You think they wanna hear you judge 'em, that'll end quick
'Specially when you the one who failed him to begin with
But you can't fight the whole world
Some fights you gotta leave 'em (listen)
Want you to think before you snap and lose you life or freedom (listen)
Don't be who they say you are, 'cause they ain't loved you ever
The anger that you got in you, use it to make you better

If we stop livin' this way, then this world will get better
Food for the hungry and a home for those who need shelter
No evil, no greed, no loss, no government, live free
No violence, no racism, or getting killed by police
No poison in the air, just beautiful skies
No television, all they do it just feed us a bunch of lies
No , no problem, no , or disease
A better economy so no one can live in poverty
A world with no social media, where we teach our kid
Where we cherish each moment and don't let valuable time slip
Work together and restore the world, the hatred just ignore
It's time we must poor love in to these empty lost souls
That's our goal

I'm loyal with my fam because we thicker then blood
So when you fall and can't get up, that's when I'm pickin' you up
God protect me from the hatred, give me wisdom, and trust
You see, humanity's about race, and my religion is love
Pain and heartache ain't forever so I work through the trouble
We gotta make the world better, lets encourage each other
See, your visions distorted, that's why you think we opponents
It's a big disappointment to see the spirit is dormant
Too many dreamers nowadays, we gotta wake up and talk

This ain't what ya want

Man I’m simple, if I eat and hit one cash lick that’s a good night
And I promise I can’t even tell you what a Maybach look like
I’ll break you and your kinfolks, you basement, bro, I’m tenth flo’
I tried to jam your album but I dozed off on the intro
It’s on when them punks come along
Show up and send ‘em running home
They say if you ain’t got no enemies, you doin’ something wrong
We ain’t friends, you the one that tried to claim my ends
I was single, now I’m dating this new chick, her name’s Revenge
We coming out swinging, H Town we grinding hard
James Harden of the game, watch the homie ball
I keep it blazing, ain’t nobody on my level
95 in a 65, petal to the metal
I’m on the block, keep it sizzling, I’m phenomenal
Jack of all trades, I ain’t scared of the impossible
My flows be nautical, these verses steady bombing you
Wrecking every beat, spittin’ hard like a llama do

I said losing ain’t a option, and winning is a must
Any time that they got close, we left ‘em spinning in the dust
Calm down, calm down, you know them losses don’t fit us
Calm down, calm down, come get some of this bread with us
I said losing ain’t a option, and winning is a must
Any time that they got close, we left ‘em spinning in the dust
Calm down, calm down, you know them losses don’t fit us
Calm down, calm down, relax and get this bread with us

I don’t get mad if they hate me, I tell them fellas get on
Everywhere I go I be smelling that jealous cologne
Undisputed veteran status plus I’m better than average
They ravage through my book like pill heads in medicine cabinets
Tell your man to man, I still hustle my units hand to hand
And f*ck Waller County police for murdering Sandra Bland
Time for payback, them cowards be whispering, “K, don’t say that”
Me and the SPC go way back like a Isley Brother 8-track
Yeah we all in, no hesitation, I dive in
All gas and no brakes, losing ain’t no option, no option
I’ma kill the beat and I’ma kill the flow
It’s the SPC, I’ma let ‘em know
Got my finger on the trigger on the 9mm
Hollow tips motherf*cker, I’ma let them go
They hatin’ on my paper, hatin’ on my grind
Even in my Harris County orange I’ma shine
They can lock up my body but not my mind
All corruption gets exposed, only a matter of time

I said losing ain’t a option, and winning is a must
Any time that they got close, we left ‘em spinning in the dust
Calm down, calm down, you know them losses don’t fit us
Calm down, calm down, come get some of this bread with us

Any time that they got close, we left ‘em spinning in the dust
Calm down, calm down, you know them losses don’t fit us
Calm down, calm down, relax and get this bread with us

Dudes be talkin’ ‘bout how they ballin’ and drippin’ with ice
They tell you money ain’t a object, ’til you give ‘em your price
Then they start shiftin’ and twitchin’ like they itchin’ from lice
Talkin’ ‘bout “Let me check with my people, I’ll hit you tonight”
You know them fools lie, them classic like an old school ride
Sometimes I wish yo mama woulda got her tubes tied
I push down on the gas and never slow up
I wanna be five again so I can wish to be just like me when I grow up
K yo, these fools be so phony and sensitive I ain’t buyin’ it
Cue the violence, they ‘bout to make me get violent
And I be serious, it’s real when it comes to music
All this bullsh*t on the radio make me wanna lose it
And I ain’t playin’ games, I tell it like it is
The best of the best, representing for the Mexicans
Iller than most, yeah we iller than you
We only play the game to win, we don’t ever play to lose

I said losing ain’t a option, and winning is a must
Any time that they got close, we left ‘em spinning in the dust

Stop Resisting,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Yeah man
Sittin’ here tryna figure out
Why law enforcement
Keep on decidin’ they wanna kill black people, man
It’s startin’ to get to me
Check this out

Police killing black people never ended, they still do
The second they pulled you over, they intended to kill you
Marked for the flamin’, even with no talk or complainin’
Provocation and escalation is a part of the trainin’
They start with the game and even when you offer your name and identification they aim and sparks get to raining
Or stomped to the pavement, to them it’s just all entertainment
No probable cause, forced in armed bars and restrainin’
We look at the cycle but will the crooked be liable?
It’s posted on every social site, the footage is viral
Comments from every race and political rivals
Provide views based on what side they subscribe to
The racists showin' up on every post with imaginary quotes
And those of hypothetical scenarios
They be like, ‘Maybe he did this or did that’
But wait, I got a maybe for your maybe he was black

You got your hands in the air, they like, “Stop resisting”
Hogtied on your stomach, they like, “Stop resisting”
Been shot twenty times, they like, “Stop resisting”
Tryna tell ‘em but the evil ass cops ain’t listening
Got your hands in the air, they like, “Stop resisting”
Hogtied on your stomach, they like, “Stop resisting”
Been shot twenty times, they like, “Stop resisting”
Tryna tell ‘em but the evil ass cops ain’t listening

They be like
Keep your hands where I can see ‘em, show me your ID
Why you movin’ around? You tryna pull a weapon on me?
See you just lookin’ for a reason you can blow me to pieces
How I’m supposed to get my license out? Telekinesis?
Cops treat blacks differently, won’t none of ‘em say
How the hell you feelin’ threatened when I’m runnin’ away?
Then you cap ‘em and stun, listen, you the adamant one
He’ll cuff you then accuse you of grabbin’ his gun
It’s a part of procedure made up in order to bleed ya
Don’t believe the garbage the police department’ll feed ya
Investigations that leave us despising the system
And the media instantly criminalizes the victim
‘He jaywalked in ’03, he had weed in his house
One night he got drunk and accidentally peed on his couch’
They look for anything they can find to cover the fact
That he got murdered by a racist swine who don’t like blacks

You got your hands in the air, they like, “Stop resisting”
Hogtied on your stomach, they like, “Stop resisting”
Been shot twenty times, they like, “Stop resisting”
Tryna tell ‘em but the evil ass cops ain’t listening
Got your hands in the air, they like, “Stop resisting”
Hogtied on your stomach, they like, “Stop resisting”
Been shot twenty times, they like, “Stop resisting”
Tryna tell ‘em but the evil ass cops ain’t listening

You try to say 'I know my rights,' they’ll laugh at you
Police chief said he did what he had to do
Gotta watch the coon police who passin’ through
‘cause black cops whoopin’ black people asses too
Innocent people everyday get sadly arrested
You approached the car already mad and aggressive
You ain’t enforcin’ the law, only intimidation
Tryna turn the hood back into the slave plantation
White ladies call the cops on us every evening
‘Uh, yes, there’s a black guy at a bus stop breathing'
Can’t barbecue, can’t take a nap ‘round them
Can’t sell water, can’t cut the grass or swim
You see ‘em on television and they’re backin’ the statements
I ain’t crackin’ jokes, all of these are actual cases
Media know it’s a lie but they still gon’ play it
You could already be dead and they still gon’ say it

You got your hands in the air, they like, “Stop resisting”
Hogtied on your stomach, they like, “Stop resisting”
Been shot twenty times, they like, “Stop resisting”
Tryna tell ‘em but the evil ass cops ain’t listening
Got your hands in the air, they like, “Stop resisting”

Blast On Um

I heard your album and although it's far from brilliant
I'ma give you a ten out of a possible million
Beating K-Rino, wassup, who jumping on that?
A damn midget got a better chance of dunking on Shaq
These counterfeiters getting slain by vernacular
Daily I'm producing more bars than a soap manufacturer
Put me on the mic I win wars
Fuck over you like I was having sex with my wife in apartment upstairs from yours
They goin hunt for you like Red October
I stood on the same side of the street for five weeks, cause I ain't wanna crossover
You say you make hits, H-I-T-S let's see
Put the S in front of the H, that's what it sound like to me
You took a catastrophical L and it's time to pay up
And I ain't got to dunk I'll break the backboard doing a layup
And you don't pay me what you owe me
And I ain't whooping with a switch, I'll beat his ass with the whole tree

Blast On Um
Forget his wife and his kids
Just verbally execute him for that shit that he did
And blast on um, uh
Just think homicide
Even after he apologize you don't let it slide
Blast on um, yeah
Before he could blink
I'll poison your mind and make you sick whenever you think
Blast on um
Hit 'em with dangerous words
That run for miles cause they contain a flight range of a bird

We look at you as trash (yeah)
You're an imitation of the rapper who is imitating the one-hit wonder from last year
I can't believe that these fools done built up the gumption
Your rhymes softer than a fool with erectile dysfunction
The last rhyme I heard you say (wassup) I just couldn't follow it
My stomach cramped up when you said it because I'm wack-flows intolerant
The truest, fool you got sliced up and you knew it
Your style is so basic and easy a caveman wouldn't do it
Stop lying, your whole persona's built off part of mine
A bootlegger heard your shit and said ""this is where I draw the line""
You been trying to analyze me like you K's psychiatrist
You must want a foot in yo ass like a gay podiatrist
See my rap's a Venus Flytrap, I unfold
And catapult your soul across the spiritual threshold
Till they know you faker than a dildo
I call you ""30 seconds"" cause you the commercial shit that interrupts the real show

Got damn! Look what you made me do, muthafucka. I told yo ass to shut the fuck up and guess what's coming to ya! But nah, you wanna open up yo MUTHAFUCKING MOUTH! So I'ma stick this pitbull on ya. K-Rino where you at?


The only way that you can drop a tight CD, you clown
Is if you pick one of mine up and let it fall to the ground
Don't get mad because your mind can't follow me
That's like expecting a '92 cellular to have iPhone technology
Hit you with every deadly word I know, insert a murder flow
That staggers you worse that a wino in vertigo
When you step into my zone it gets hot
You in the wrong space like an able-bodied person parked in a handicapped spot
Now when I see you, I ain't talking a paint in your lame ass
Like a college student and a fifth grader we ain't in the same class
Like a young trick in love, I'm turning the game out
The best case scenario is if you blow your brains out
They call me the paper stacker, with a trunk full of ends
They call you a pain in the ass like a punk and a pen
And when K-Rino places you in interrogation
You get took out like bad kidneys in transplant patients",https://genius.com/K-rino-blast-on-um-lyrics

Address this one more time
I hope we get it together
But in the meantime
Might as well ride on em
You know somebody like this look out

They say misery loves company that's true information
I think we all in need of deep psychiatric evaluation
Word's hateful, lethal, envious and deceitful
Why do we go out of our way just to impress other people?
I done figured out the cause but I can't find the remedy
Gotta fight my own people just to get to the enemy
Lies and fake ways ran off consecutive
And ten things come out then mouth then nine of em are negative
Won't they happy till they use you up and bleed you to ruin
The fool with nothing try to tell you what you need to be doing
Instigators, peace breakers, no matter they speed
I keep my distance like a track-runner with a two lap lead
It's an answer for these so-called G's who block beef
Got slanderous words in they mouth then they got teeth
All yo hating ain't got nothing to me
You couldn't bring me down if you was a fireman and I was stuck in a tree

Your Transparent
And I'm a bring the truth to ya
Even with my eyes closed I can see right through ya
Same ones hanging with'cha same ones that'll do ya
We was down from the junk last like I never knew ya

I ain't never been a dude you could easily gas up
(Anything you need I got'cha) shut your lying ass up!
Ya whole game is manipulation lying and using
So artificial and fraud you've becoming translucent
Testing my cool but fool I'm destine to prove
Ninety percent of y'all is faker than a wrestling move
When snakes come in my grass try'na drop they trash
Like a stalker on the internet I'd block they ass
You wanna know why you broke, cause you scared to hustle
You comfortable being poor and never lifting a muscle
Fool you got something to say to me come take the stand
If you know that you don't like me, man don't shake my hand
Don't ask me for my number, don't say it's all love
When last week you high-capped, when I saw you at the club
Now I catch you in my hood all of a sudden we cool
You rubbed alot of people wrong I ain't goin stop till I prule

You're Transparent
And I'm a bring the truth to ya
Even with my eyes close I can see right through ya
Same ones hanging with ya same ones that'll do ya
We was down from the junk last like I never knew ya

What you got don't fascinate me so get off the gas
I ain't never been impressed by another man's cash
You sitting on a high hill looking down low
The same cats that helped you win, you don't know em no more
You're a lose your respect and the streets done degrade you
When you disconnect yourself from the people that made you
Portraying a false image, you don't even believe
You underwent character change that you don't even precede
When you was going through your problems, I was there through the heat
But when I told you mine you took my business all over the street
To the clique or the game you was never devoted
Any good you ever did had ulterior motives
I see through you like a window like an unzipped zipper
I see through you like some bitch had panty-hose on a stripper
I see through you like a doctor operating on a patient
Like a glass door in X-ray vision so stop faking

The Transparent
And I'm a bring the truth to ya
Even with my eyes close I can see right through ya
Same ones hanging with'cha same ones that'll do ya

Straight from the creator
And manifests when we put its mind on display
Any time of the day
As long as I’m in alignment with my assignment, then I’ma find me a way

From the god we were born
His thoughts elevated beyond, he perfected and replicated his form
And it was painful, the pitch black darkness of the universe just a womb that he came through
And after the crafting of himself had enacted
He wanted duality so his help was extracted
In fact the female was exactly what he needed to initiate the human genetic tract like that
To the present and actual time
Physically designed out of his supernatural mind
Your blood is like the water that exists in the seas
Your bones are like stones and your flesh are the leaves
You’re initially given the key to bein’ free
From the moment you receive permission to even breathe
The power and energy that god wants you to see
It’s easily accessible to both you and me

We got divine DNA
Straight from the creator
And manifests when we put its mind on display
Any time of the day
As long as I’m in alignment with my assignment, then I’ma find me a way

First was the word, that’s what we were taught
But before the word forms there has to be a thought
The path that we were brought was rapidly abort
Our chances of properly mastering the course
A hard battle to fight, it’s more that I can write
‘cause it dates back to that first atom of life
Seventy-six trillion years is what we read
To the beginning we’re led, we were still in his head
The essence that never dies that ties and guides us
Everything living in him lives inside us
We were called out of our lost brain and came forth
Unique strands originating from the same source like that
Grateful he would choose to bless me
And connect me with perpetual ancestry
Part of a legacy, connected genetically
Though every one of us is an individual recipe

We got divine DNA
Straight from the creator
And manifests when we put its mind on display
Any time of the day
As long as I’m in alignment with my assignment, then I’ma find me a way

He lays out for us a righteous itinerary
But this world functions on the contrary
Placed in the mind to go against our nature
By devilish ways and the iniquity that shaped us
The world makes us self-hating patrons
So god’s ways now have a depraved replacement
Used to be wide awoke, now we sleep a lot
And everything that we ever once was we forgot
So it’s tough to imagine and hard to surmise
That we are the wise ones who put the stars in the skies
All science and technology, this is a fact
So when you think you’re a nobody think about that

We got divine DNA
Straight from the creator
And manifests when we put its mind on display
Any time of the day
As long as I’m in alignment with my assignment, then I’ma find me a way",https://genius.com/K-rino-divine-dna-lyrics
Follow Me,The Hit List,2004,"Murderism defines the flow
Who me? Murder One designs the intro
K-Rino with the killer flow for those that don't know

I said follow me, follow me
If you want to see a lyrical murderer
Follow me, follow me
If you want to see an SPC murderer

I own a rifle that shoots arsenic mixed with Nyquil
My mental is so eventful that what I write will leave the pencil on its menstrual cycle
Whoever's next, I take your concepts out of context
And with one flex thrust 'em into an intergalactic apartment complex
I bring pestilence to your residence
My lyrics are used by central intelligence agencies to assassinate presidents
To battle me many be placing bids
But when I flow and then it's their turn, they pass just like Jason Kidd
It ain't no grasping these fast men, rhyme headaches left me gasping
Therefore, I swallow dictionaries just like aspirin
I separate your composite by each component
The instrumental urinated once it found out I'd be rapping on it
Open your mind and let the master in
I'm faster than bastards in track and field, don't need water, pass me a glass of wind
The known crook who left his own shook
Ripping at random and practicing at home by memorizing a phone book

I said follow me, follow me
If you want to see a lyrical murderer
Follow me, follow me
If you want to see an SPC murderer

I got lyrical Call Waiting in my brain design
So I might click over to another rhyme on another line in my other mind
And discover I'm a supreme poet, planets bleed when this brother rhyme
And I give birth to millions of minutes just by making love to time
When I presenting this, I'm scientific like photosynthesis
You meant to diss, show your jugulars where I place most of my emphasis
I turn and give someone they burned their wisdom
I represent eternalism, the fatal masochist passing his bloody journalism
My thinking surpasses celestial
Arresting you by placing you in an extraterrestrial murder vestibule
I swing the mic and chop bodies like lumber
I been putting work in, my total ends resembles a social security number
When I go to bed with a female she has to wear a vest (Why?)
'Cause if she don't she'll end up dead with a verse carved across her chest
It's hell to tell when I'm ringing your bell
I pull simulated variations of generations out of a singular cell

I said follow me, follow me
If you want to see a lyrical murderer
Follow me, follow me
If you want to see an SPC murderer

You could be a thousand miles away and want to challenge K, so snatch the green
Just to get to you I'll send my body through a fax machine
Crack your team, the skin melts when blasted by the acid beam
Smother brains with cellophane, make flames by pissing gasoline
Hit the stage and then inflict the page until it's sick with rage
Engage and body change till I dissolve into my liquid stage
Go inside myself, study my molecules and clear a blemish
Master laws of physics then trade places with my mirror image
Been on Earth since time began so ain't nobody old as me
Built your style off mine and got the nerve to think you cold as me
Flying through the sky and coming down with bows that weigh a ton
Wrestlers come off top ropes, K-Rino be jumping off the Sun
Draining 'em and like the laws I'm locking up and chaining 'em
Opponents drown while swimming in my Mediterranean cranium
Real telekinesis I'm displaying when I spit a rhyme
Inject my spirit into 15 million bodies at a time

I said follow me, follow me
If you want to see a lyrical murderer
Follow me, follow me
If you want to see an SPC murderer",https://genius.com/K-rino-follow-me-lyrics

Graphic details, pictures images
Vividly well-spoken to slaughter my nemesis
Turned to Genesis, while you riding a see-saw
And back to Ezekiel and using what he saw
Me on the wheel just standing still
The god of this site shit you know the deal
I'm a scientist that's the reason you study me
But there's another level once you come meet the other me!
The  brain stay sharp as a pencil
I learn to make miracles with kitchen utensils
A fork or a spoon I'm a serial killer
I'm good with a knife but I love the scissors
Make ya lungs collapse and all that good shit
So who the fuck you think, roast a Chucky for bush wick?

Yeah, you put your head on the line where you decided to tell
Now you gotta a nice price on it like you was on sell
You know the streets is real the youth the targets
Hate growing 'cause the Black president is in office
Fool the devil situation been sinking in failing
If you ride with the Tea Party you stupid like Sarah Palin
Playing and wasting time while you under the knife
Put the blunt down for a second man and think about life
You say it ain't racist when a brother gets beat and they tape it
Showing to the world in court and still manage to escape it
They want you in they jails (uh) stop putting yourself in 'em
A worldwide genocidal-plot and y'all helping him
Once the head spin it'll certainly hurt a bit
We the victims of a four-hundred fifty year murder hit
See they want your birthright; they took our rights at birth
It's the undercover auction how much is your life worth?

Same nigga that did it standing there when they popped ya, yeah
Most all cowards, don't know how to act

And it's always consequence dealing with a bunch of currency
Your best man can be the one to shove a knife in ya
Or a bitch mad at'cha, tryna get back at'cha

Everytime,Lightning Language (The 4-Piece #1),2019,"Everytime they call ya, they want something
They hit ya ‘til your cash is flat
Nothing left to add to that

I’ma be real with it, I don’t see how you still kick it
They don’t see you as a friend, they see you as a meal ticket
When they call, you already know they ‘bout to go live
They either need some money, a place to stay or a ride
Soon as you answer the phone, they ready to mash ya
Especially when they start with “Man, I sure hate to ask ya”
And then they start beggin’ hard as hell
You said you didn’t wanna ask, fool, I can’t tell
You straight roachin’, man, don’t act like you wasn’t
You ain’t said how ya been, how your mama doin’ or nothing
You just went in, dropping that sad story in fact
All that's missin’ is a violin playin’ in the back
What’s real crazy, you ain’t heard from this cat in so long
That you ain’t recognize the number when it came on your phone
You took a chance, now you’re dealing with something you didn’t plan
And now you’re mad at yourself, saying, “I knew I shouldn’t'a answered ‘cause

Everytime they call ya, they want something
They bleed ya ‘til your cash is flat
Nothing else to add to that
Everytime they call ya, they want something
They bleed ya ‘til your cash is flat
Ain’t nothing else to add to that

Whenever they hit you now, you duckin’
They leave a message sayin’, “Boy, you should a hard man to get in touch with”
Yeah you right, I can’t rock with you, brotha
‘cause I ain’t takin’ care of you, homie, I’m not your mother
They’ll pop up at your crib, yeah they just that raw
Got you hiding in your house like you duckin’ the law
They’ll ask you for anything you got under the sun
Talkin’ ‘bout “Let me use your car, I need to make a few runs”
Boy, I almost told you something, man, this ain’t no bluff
People with nothing have no problems tearing up yo stuff
And when you ask about your money and them giving it back
They be like, “That was months ago, you still trippin’ on that?”
Don’t let ‘em come up, they get so fly that it ain’t even funny
“Man, you blowin’ up my phone over that punk ass money?”
See you was cryin’ when you borrowed it, I’m tellin’ your secret
You sure right, since it’s like that, you’re good, you can keep it
It’s like

Everytime they call ya, they want something
They bleed ya ‘til your cash is flat
Nothing else to add to that
Everytime they call ya, they want something
They bleed ya ‘til your cash is flat
Ain’t nothing else to add to that

Stop lettin’ ‘em put your bank account to regular use
I hate when people use their children as a begging excuse
“I gotta get junior some school clothes and don’t know how”
You got two hundred dollar tennis shoes on right now
It’s like they know that they a roach and they just tryna provoke
You ain’t heard from ‘em since the last time they was broke
He asked for some gas money, yeah I showed him some love
But it wasn’t to go to work, he tryna go to the club
It’s a bum at the corner store that’s always after me
I paid him so much it’s like I got him on salary
Any users that I ever knew I left them dudes
You owe me, why you asking me to help you move?
You got the messy kind, let me know if this type fit 'em
They start beefin' and expect you to come fight with 'em
No sir, no ma'am, you hopin' they leave you alone
And when you block 'em, they just call you from a whole other phone because

Everytime they call ya, they want something
They bleed ya ‘til your cash is flat
Nothing else to add to that

They bleed ya ‘til your cash is flat

Light Speed Circle,UnKnown,2012.0,"Man, they been chasing me for a thousand years, man
But they'll never catch me
I'm in a light speed circle, yeah, go!
Uh, Messiahs, K-Rino, South Park Coalition
The light speed circle, here we go

You can't astound me, my words cover the county
I’m seeing angelic beings hover around me
Fools thought that I was out of the game until they found me
Levitating in cement shoes, they couldn't drown me
Through osmosis I travel the cosmose
Take out the unidentified object that flies closes
No escape, I get ya and whoever's working for ya
Have people in other solar systems searching for ya
They call me the gladiator eradicator
Been here from the start I'm eternity's narrarator
Cloned a man 15 times before I kill one
Murder them all and let the cops guess who's the real one
Slugs you might feel one
I'm the epitome, the manifestation of murder Nilson
I transform into rip mode
Soon as the clip load, I detonate 75 zip codes
Change my name to Orpheus
Civilizations obliterate during my minds metamorphosis
My thinking is synonymous with ominous promises
Trained by a thousand year old astronomus
I grew another brain stem
My skill doubled so I called the astronomus back and trained him
Nobody went hard as we went we sent fools to cement
Your body parts fell out of a 
Secular rhyme recognition
To infect your mind's vision, 
I built a molecular time mechanism
Now you feel the final sword
His back collapsed due to immediate removal of his spinal cord
Paralyzed but still felt this
Skeleton extraction left his shoulder sitting on his pelvis
Close encounters of the worst kind
Two armageddons, nuclear holocaust took place in the first line

Light speed circle, got me running
Light speed circle, got me in a
Light speed circle, got me running
Light speed circle, got me in a

2000 years later, man
They still tryna catch me

I made a covenant with an alien government
So the Earth is the planet that my mother went
I looked outside and got frightened
It was grey for a week because night and day was fighting
I get a 
scope
 ’cause I ain't the one to hope
Murder my enemies, put his remains in an envelope
That'll keep his body warm
Though I didn't cremate him he was still in full body form
Ostracize men verbally
Surgically murder mercilessly at inertia level hyperbole 
Causing urgency rappers throwing up nervously
Currently I neglect life and death's emergency purposely
I'm here my attack was clear
Started December 31 and had a backwards year
Minus your whole staff with a 
lack of fear
I'm outside taking a bath in the atmosphere
Blaze your throat I wrote an outrageous quote
My rhymes so elevated that the pages float
I tighten up like wrenches
In this game I’m a ruler so they call me 12 inches
They knew I been a threat yeah
My Black Book contains more information than the internet
I'm the noise ejector with poison nectar
It's K-Rino the voice collector
The FBI couldn't knab it
I had a whole book written on a microscopic tablet
Removing oxygen from your whole populace
My normal vision equivalent to binoculars
It well known I’ve outflown birds
My flow is so deep I found myself stealing my own words
Would i ride on ‘em? Yeah buddy
My automatic spits so many rounds, it left the air bloody

Light speed circle, got me running
Light speed circle, got me in a
Light speed circle, got me running
Light speed circle, got me in a

OK, woo, that was close
Who's that?
Oh, I seen something back on Mars man
But they ain't catching me
I'm too fast for ‘em, come on

My enemy lied
I had funeral arrangements set up before he even died
My shots be coming with kamikaze velocity
I been anointed to engineer rhyme prophecy
While these punks is posing news flexing
I'm putting organs in the frozen food section
I detonated your retina, my silhouette threatens ya
While I stepped in the gas chambers wetting ya
Infect the mic with electrolytes of record heights
Thought capacity holds infinite megabytes
The single hand triple teamer
I punish the schemer with emphysema the human jet streamer
I'm on top with no one allowed rappers bowed
Because they knew that my words produce funnel clouds
I outplayed the plan, you laid the man
A slave was made to swallow 21 hand grenades
What I speak don’t come cheap
I run solo invading the whole city run deep
I had a battle with a sun beast
I put a crease in his sternum when I unleashed one piece
My interior is superior
I'm a blade wielder cutting you in a critical area
Helping you see better like glasses do
I’m the bridge to the other side every ghost passes through
Masses knew when I’m landing skill
That I'm equipped to kill, I'm as fast as you when I'm standing still
See I'm a warlock with a magic wand
See now you want the business end of a tragic bond
See everything ain't what it seems
My sleep consists of 18 murderers simultaneous dreams
Ain't no escape when you go shife
I'll be chilling in the future waiting to take ya life

Light speed circle, got me runnin
Light speed circle, got me in a
Light speed circle, got me runnin

More Than Ever,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"Ay, can't nobody be superman or superwoman all the time, man, you need some help

Life is hard enough with a team
So tryna handle problems by yourself’s a different thing
It seems like things pop off at the strangest times
You thought about calling for help but then you changed your mind
Friends and family let you know it’s always room to ride
No one to reach out ‘cause your logic got consumed with pride
Told yo homie you was good, he looked and said, “You sho?”
You hit your mama with that same lie, see even mama know
You used to be the one who helped others when they was down
Now you ashamed to let them know yo plane done switched around
You feel like if you tell ‘em your weakness might be exposed
You on the verge of losing hope and no one even knows
There’s nothing wrong with being lifted up by your fam
Sometimes Robin helped Batman get up out a jam
Quit actin’ rough like you don’t need no one to back you up
Because the time gon’ come when real life gon’ jack you up
So listen bro

You can’t make it in this world alone
Alone, lone, lone, lone
We all need somebody we can depend on
No matter how you think you in control
Contro-o-o-ol
It’s always something we can’t handle or we fail to know

See, for the record
With your thoughts it’s cool to be overprotective
But different opinions tend to provide different perspectives
You ain’t gotta tell the whole planet your business, be selective
Only council with wise ones who advise positive methods, see
When you fall the road back can be a long one
Yeah I know it, you supposed to be the strong one
And through the loss and through the drama whatever
You the one who usually holding the family together, yeah
So now you seein’ yo safety net fall through
When folks needed a place to stay and some money, they called you
Now you need somebody to confide in and talk to
But it’s hard to do ‘cause you used to it being all you
I know you got a friend on who you can directly depend
Stop blockin’ ‘em out fam, you got to let people in
You bein’ the one to guide others through issues in they life
So since it’s your turn, it’s time for you to take your own advice

You can’t make it in this world alone
Alone, lone, lone, lone
We all need somebody we can depend on
No matter how you think you in control
Contro-o-o-ol
It’s always something we can’t handle or we fail to know

Man
You pushin’ hard to get your stuff fixed
You tryna build a house, but you ain’t got enough bricks
It’s never no time, not enough hours in the day
And now that you overloaded, your energy is MIA
See one deep all the time should never be the plan
Understand even a solo singer need a band
See you can interact and still be a leader, man
But let somebody help you carry that load and free your hand
Lonely living is a hard pill to swallow, dude
And every now and then we all need some solitude
But don’t let it be the good folks you try to get rid of
Real patnas offer you insight you might not’ve considered
That’s a scenario some people ain’t comfortable with
Might be missing blessings and gifts that God wants you to get
You need a lifeboat when things start sinking
See you standing on the brink ‘cause regardless of what you thinking

You can’t make it in this world alone
Alone, lone, lone, lone
We all need somebody we can depend on
No matter how you think you in control

Now What,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"If you going through this
This for you
Just think about it real deep

When we were together
Never thought two'd become three
So, now what? Is it over?
This I can't believe

I got a phone call the other night
Information that would transform a brother's life
Off the Richter, whole vibe seem suspect
My girl was on the phone, sounding like she was upset
What the matter? What's the deal?
What's the problem? Keep it real, you can tell me how you feel
She said, ""Well, I haven't been feeling great
My friend that comes to visit once a month's a little late
I said, ""Relax till we get it straight, the jury's still out
All we can do is chill and wait till we deliberate""
She said, ""What about this nausea and throwing up?""
The more she spoke the more the odds kept going up
Now I'm tryna get my mind right
Visions of that night now 20/20 in hindsight
Fear, doubt and confusion 
Stranded in the unknown aftermath of a heated moment


We only got five months worth of date time
Started thinking about rumours I'd heard through the grapevine
Do I really know her like I thought? Peace I can't find
What if this a hustle and this baby really ain't mine
Huh, better call my old man up
First thing he said, ""If it's yours, you better stand up""
I called mama cause crazy I was about to go
She said, ""Don't worry until you find out for sho""
Maybe this is a blessing that God's showing you""
Mama said, ""If you stressing, imagine what she's going through
If she is be a man, try to clear the air""
""OK, let me call her, better yet I'm going over there""
Showed up with an EPT, she took it out the box
I stepped in the other room cause I wasn't about to watch
Both of us stressing, anxious with a nervous heart
Showed the stick to me, plus sign in the circle part


We both sat down, contemplating what to do
I told her it up to her, she told me, ""It's up to you""
Now we arguing, our volume starting to increase
She ain't have a job and I'm barely making my ends meet
And now the frustration, words got hostile
How do I know you've only been with me and this is my child
When I said that, I seen the hurt in her eyes show
She started to cry, I saw hope start to die slow
I knew I shouldn't have took it there, that's when I started crying
Lying if I say, ""Abortion never crossed my mind""
Then my life's mission came to me like a vision
I'm being selfish, I need to make the right decision
For all three of us, troubles come, we fight back
Deadbeat and negligent, I could never be like that
We stayed up discussing it till the break of day
Decided to have my child and trust in God to make a way

Holding on, gotta be strong
Holding on, is it over?",https://genius.com/K-rino-now-what-lyrics
Keep It Simple,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"I think you're trying way too hard to be somebody else
Really young brother, just be yourself
It's always good to listen but you can't follow everybody
And your not going to be able to trust anybody
You gotta be headstrong 'cause the weak get ate
Put their ass on a hook and use them as bait
Don't get caught up in the grind, that ain't where you wanna be
Talk just talk unless it's right in front of me
Yeah you gotta beware, always beware
'cause these bitches not loyal, these bitches don't care
Do me a favor, put your P sign in the air
Bloods and Crips tonight, we gonna do it together
'Cause I know blacks kill more blacks than cops do
So while we killing each other, they killing us too
We just gotta be a little more smart
And if you wanna work that much hard

Don't get out of character to hold no bread

Hit List,The Hit List,2004,"Oh
Big Ron the don
In here with the leader of the SPC and the general
Know what I'm talking about?
A hit list
They just going down the line
Marking off mark ass niggas that be lying
Know what I'm talking about?
Ain't never had a fight in they life

So many copycats, six feet deep is where they laying
I won't even mention murders done by Timothy McVeigh
Bodies float in the river, that's the reason you quiver
Cut your liver to the point to where the insects shiver
And tell me that they don't want none, they tell me they full
They say they gained 10 pounds each from 2 dead bulls
SPC roundup, we ready to ride
The wire cutters, they wouldn't stop until my arms got tired
See I'm a real psychopath, I come to set things straight
And John Gacy wasn't tripping off the people he ate
See if you biting on my rap style you bound to get beat
To add another dead corpse to the freezer full of meat
And bags of ligaments, he passed away in the mud
The doctors called me just to tell me that they ran out of blood
And that they need much more, cause Nip has skills
That's just some psycho shit I think about doing for real

It take years for my words to kick in, it’s true
Lines I kicked in ’92, got fools today now going, “Wooooo!”
I spark a rhyme curse at 9 tonight
He stole my book then read a verse and now he blind for life
Understand my voice is powerful, you never hit gate
I train it by swallowing gas with Everclear straight
Elevate, I’m like a rap and running back I’m so cold
Rushed for 2000 rhymes last year, went to the floorboard
See my eyes, look at them deeper, now you’re starting to strain
I bring trauma to rappers, causing heart attacks in the brain
It’s death, so I delete the rules then murder the rep
You experience me throwing right jabs with my left
Marvelous specimen, mind over matter, master quantum leaping
No panic, I’m in the midst of violent earthquakes and sleeping
Deep in meditative process, my verses are many
You think you got more flow than K and NIP, whatever, bet 20 fool

You on my hit list and I don’t ball ya
I’ve been waiting to violate ya the first time I saw ya
Commit the murder real slow and prolong the pain
And swing till the blood pours out like the rain

You see it's nothing but murder inside the mind of a psych
Sick ass thoughts makes me vision pints of blood in the Sprite
Pop the top, drink some, if you really ready
See if you get the machete, then I'll go eat the spaghetti
Eminem, he going to get fucked off, cause I can't stand him
It's nothing but executions in my memorandum
SPC is nothing but a knife in fact
Switch up and change my voice white boy, can you do that?
I'm your idol, don't front, you know I'm the man
They'll find you slapped up and wrapped up in two stolen vans
Cut up in bits and pieces till I make him my word
I tried to make him something plural, like a noun or a verb
Something like D-I-T-C-H is a ditch
And if I wasn't a psychopath white boy my voice wouldn't switch
AKs with 50 round clips is my ammunition
Get crunk and your body parts will come up missing

I crack at 'em with rap patterns, the phantasm that left instrumentals with track spasms
The force of my intercourse is like infinite orgasms
In fact I'm a black fist master slashing a sword past him
Murder with both hands, I go agger than Dave Banner
Infected your whole sect in an ambidextrous manner
Electrical manuscript, I leave rappers with head shots
Could be paraplegic but still put you in a figure-4 leglock
Soldiers watch for the red dot, try me
'cause be slashing, behind me, it's Red Rum and I'm coming
Strong enough to impregnate a dead woman
I drop a scary infection and cancel every connection
You'll be the first man to receive a cesarean section
Go deeper than an extreme marine biologist
Vocabulary so big a tyrannosaurus esophagus couldn't swallow this
K-Rino the seed, 90 ropes couldn't tie me
Most of my victims died happy, just honored to be murdered by me

You on my hit list and I don’t ball ya
I’ve been waiting to violate ya the first time I saw ya
Commit the murder real slow and prolong the pain
And swing till the blood pours out like the rain",https://genius.com/K-rino-hit-list-lyrics
Somewhere,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Just want to let you know that
Even though things might be going good for you
There’s somebody out there somewhere that’s going through it
We can’t never forget that
Where we learn to recognize it where we see it
Maybe we can stop somebody from goin’ over the edge
Check it

Somewhere, there’s a family living in its house
Two months behind on the rent, about to get kicked out
A homeless man laying in pain under the freeway, sick, tired and weak ‘cause he hasn’t eaten in three days
Somewhere, a child is in school about to clap back because his clothes are old so he gets roasted and laughed at
The innocence of a young girl has been corrupted because she just was molested by somebody she trusted
Somewhere, out there, a scared pregnant girl is about to abort a child that could possibly save the world
It’s a man on the edge now, back against the wall with a pistol to his head getting ready to end it all
Somewhere it’s a dude in his room on a computer, searching for guns, 'bout to be the next mass shooter
A young girl is living happily today but listen
Tomorrow she gon’ be on the news, reported missing

Somewhere
A lot of pain, a lot of problems, a lot of people in the hole
Somewhere
A lot of folks going through it in life, losing control
Somewhere
It’s a hard road, ain’t too many good people left
Somewhere
Don’t let the weight take you down, grab a hold of yourself, man

Somewhere, a woman is in love with a loser
Giving money and sex to a ruthless, abusive user
There’s a young fella running these streets, robbing to get green
Not knowing in a year from now he gon’ be serving fifteen
Somewhere, a black dude’s hanging out this evening
And a white lady’s calling the cops on him for no reason
A deceitful preacher is preaching being evil and leechin’, while speaking deep in the pockets of the people he’s reaching
Somewhere, there’s a person with a broke heart and a hurt mind, influenced easily, about to try dope for the first time
A group of government devils who take greed and step far, or in a room as we speak now planning the next war
Somewhere, somebody’s making moves in the streets
But folks don’t even know he a snitch for the police
It’s a lazy dude, savage as hell, doing some dirt, smashing his wife’s best friend when she go to work

Somewhere
A lot of pain, a lot of problems, a lot of people in the hole
Somewhere
A lot of folks going through it in life, losing control
Somewhere
It’s a hard road, ain’t too many good people left
Somewhere
Don’t let the weight take you down, grab a hold of yourself, man
But on the flip side…

Somewhere, somebody is broke and struggling hard
And they just got a phone call saying they got the job
It’s a woman who been hurt many times to the extreme
And God just blessed her to meet the man of her dreams
Somewhere a doctor told you you wouldn’t survive
That was twenty years ago, the doctor dead, you still alive
Somebody was adopted at birth and mentally suffered, and finally got to meet their biological mother
Now somewhere, a young G done got up out the game, turned his life around, now he helping others do the same
It’s amazing, somebody got pulled over this morning
And the cop ain’t even trip, he let him drive off with a warning
Somewhere, one of these neighborhood ghetto children became a entrepreneur, man, and now he’s worth millions
A proud mother’s out there sheddin’ some happy tears
And it’s a couple celebrating being married for fifty years

Somewhere
A lot of pain, a lot of problems, a lot of people in the hole
Somewhere
A lot of folks going through it in life, losing control
Somewhere
It’s a hard road, ain’t too many good people left
Somewhere
Don’t let the weight take you down, grab a hold of yourself, man",https://genius.com/K-rino-somewhere-lyrics
Raised in the Dead End,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"Yeah, your boy K-Rino man
I got love, for everybody
But I'ma tell y'all, a little something
'Bout where I come from, listen

I was raised in the Dead End, the Park is my hood
K-Rino, South Park Coalition
I was raised in the Dead End, the Park is my hood
It don't matter where you from, if you real it's all good
I was raised in the Dead End, the Park is my hood
K-Rino, South Park Coalition
I was raised in the Dead End, the Park is my hood
Esperad's or King Scape, Orleans Summerwood

I represent one of the realest hoods, that you'll see
Where we sleep an hour a day and hustle for 23
When it's plex we don't get mad, we just get even
And if paper ain't on your mind, you must not be breathing
We ain't tripping spring, fall, summer, winter we grind
And police, be hating 99 percent of the time
You can find what you need, pills weed or powder
And bring your girl around these players, you might leave without her
If it's some dirt to get done, we done already did it
In whatever way it can get got, that's how we gon' get it
Matter fact was in the back, but we earn the lead
We learned how to throw them things before we learned to read
Don't slip or you could lose a ride that you just got
Might get cussed out by a little mama posted up at the bus stop
We'll click up but we don't mind standing alone
And don't come here on vacation cause you might not make it home


You got a pistol and you broke, all you need is a mask
Got a car some conversation, then it's easy to smash
Grind for 26-9, chunking G's in a stash
You come around here acting hard, we put them beads on your ass
Used to skip school to pick up street knowledge from Gs
Making millions, without diplomas or college degrees
Everyday some gunfire penetrated the air
You might get set up by the same chick, that braided your hair
If you know about some dirt, then you bet not tell it
The whole hood is like a Flea Market, you need it we sell it
Put a stunt behind some paper, you might get hid
If we don't know you when you come around, you might get slid
Young hustlers tryna get it, cooking work in the kitchen
And if the police is your partners, then you must be snitching
95 percent of my hood ain't no punk
Can buy some clothes or CDs and some weed out the same trunk


Every man for his self, don't expect no favors
The dope dealer and the preacher might be next door neighbors
It ain't hard to get swallowed up, your girl'll get jacked
One day she innocent and the next day she working the track
You ain't got no real stripes if you bringing in mail
And you ain't sending in no paper to your homies in jail
They say you ain't promised tomorrow, it's worse where I'm from
If it's twelve o'clock, you ain't promised 12:01
We ain't tripping on your money, we ain't tripping on your ride
We ain't tryna knock your hustle, we ain't plexing with your side
We ain't hating on your come up, we just tryna make our own
And ain't gon' let no out-of-towners disrespect us in our zone
Run the streets all night, bust without no warning
Hit the club, the after hours and then church the next morning
Haters dissing our region like we some newcomers
If you don't likes us then you leave us, stop tryna eat from us",https://genius.com/K-rino-raised-in-the-dead-end-lyrics
Raise Up,Danger Zone,1995,"Definition of a god, originator
Initiator of the Universe, some triple darkness came the first
Life travelled for a distance
Out of the womb did the dark gods spark into existence
Everything else was sparkless
Knowing this Allah came up and went to war with the darkness
Called things into existence using sound
Formed the planets and the Sun to revolve around
Flashing back before anything else appears
Allah studied himself for six trillion years
Blacker than black no denying that natural fact
Know that the essence every colour comes from is black
Man created in the image of God through birth
Made to dwell for a thousand years each on Earth
Don’t take heed to the message you might just miss
Know that the nature of a God is righteousness

Black man, it’s time to Raise Up
People in the Park, it’s time to Raise Up
People in the Ward, it’s time to Raise Up
K-Rino will drop the knowledge and kick the rough

God appeared in the person of Master Fard
Mohammed, this fact might be hard to comprehend
He came like a thief in the night
Not a comet, pumping the infinite knowledge in the brain Islamic
Teachings black man, original sounds erratic
Math is Islam and Islam is mathematics
I got potential but I use only part of my brain
God possesses power high on an infinite plain
The true reality of God, some tend to fear it
I know you don’t wanna hear it but he ain’t no spirit
I’ll go through it watch me do it, I’ll flow like fluid
God is a man and the scriptures bare witness to it
They say he walks and talks and eats and grieves and touches
Spirits only float, I give examples of such as ghosts
Man is in the image of God, like you
If he’s the spirit wouldn’t you be a spirit to
Yo, a spirit is a ‘It’ not a ‘He’ or a ‘She’
It’s time to 86 the tricknology
You’ve been exposed to a fraud
But here’s the definition of a god

Black man, it’s time to Raise Up
People in the Park, it’s time to Raise Up
Out in Sunnyside, it’s time to Raise Up
K-Rino will drop the knowledge and kick the rough
In Mo City it’s time to Raise Up
People in the Ward, it’s time to Raise Up
Brothers in the trade, it’s time to Raise Up
K-Rino will drop the knowledge and kick the rough

Step out the darkness into the light
You’re resurrected from death from blindness into the true sight
Not the physical sight, the mental vision of knowledge and self
Steady suffocating the Devil’s religion
They tried to keep prayer out of schools in this nation
Knowing that God is the creator of education
You’re demonstrating a total lack of intelligence
‘Cause the elements you taught us were irrelevant
Tapping your scriptures and try to understand
Black man is God ‘cause God is in the black man
Everywhere on the planet you find traces
So do expressing this truth make me a racist
Yo, see government and God don’t mix
The Laws of God threaten the wickedness of politics
The system tortures us with methods of the worst case
Blacks ain’t got no business in this country in the first place
So I’ma let it be known
False slave master’s teaching is about to be dethroned
By the ultimate grand lyrical legendary
Wizard resurrecting mentally from the cemetery

Black man, it’s time to Raise Up
People in the Park, it’s time to Raise Up
Out in Greens Point, it’s time to Raise Up
K-Rino will drop the knowledge and kick the rough
In Mo City it’s time to Raise Up
Out in Fourth Ward, it’s time to Raise Up
Deep in Fifth Ward, it’s time to Raise Up
K-Rino will drop the knowledge and kick the rough",https://genius.com/K-rino-raise-up-lyrics
Game For Your Daughter,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"First thing I wanna tell her is to watch these guys
Don’t get caught up when they come at you and drop these lies
First way to detect that it’s all just sex
If he tellin’ you he love you and y’all just met
If you fall for his game, you’ll regret that pain
I don’t care how good he look, you better check that brain
Keep in mind you’ll be happy ‘bout the time you took
If all he seem to talk about is how fine you look
Shut him down ‘cause what he sellin’ it ain’t what it seems
He need to be honestly interested in yo dreams
Even if he actin’ right, still watch that clown
‘cause he’ll treat ya like a angel ’til ya drawers come down
Make sure that he got goals and got him a plan
‘cause you don’t wanna spend your life with a dumb broke man
Yeah I’m tellin’ on these slick cats and puttin’ ‘em on blast
And I don’t care if yo punk ass boyfriend get mad

Don’t slip in the player trap ‘cause he tryna get with ya
And I don’t care what he tell ya, don’t send him no pictures
No shots where you bendin’ over showin’ yo ass
‘cause he gon’ show ‘em to his friends when he get back to class
And I don’t care if he got money or got him a ride
Or if he try to spend it on you, don’t let him inside
Don’t let material illusions control your moves
‘cause what you got is worth more than some clothes and shoes
Stay away from the freeloaders, they easy to spot
‘cause a sorry dude will bleed you for all that you got
Do your homework, don’t rush, make sure that it’s love
Choose wisely ‘cause you don’t wanna marry no scrub

Fast girls get snatched up and ran on through
And never ever let a man put his hands on you
Don’t think givin’ him some is gonna keep him around
‘cause these clowns’ll label you the biggest freak in the town
Oh you attracted to them thugs, tattoos and drugs
Don’t be stupid and get a crush confused with love
See he gon’ tell you to sneak out, he gon’ tell ya to skip
He gon’ try to put you in the club and get you to strip
Get you to try some dope, do a threesome, lie to the end
He gon’ go behind your back and try to smash your friend

Multiple Choice Murders,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"Aright man, here we go, it take a whole lot of heart to do this as many times as we done did it, we bringing it all together, South Park Coalition, unifying the masses, all religions and classes, multiple choice murders, meaning we choose our method of verbal homicide, then you choose the method that you prefer, we got Black Mike lacing the beat and a host of skilled emcees from every generation of the SPC, so I’ma send a shoutout to DBX, my boy Texas Tech and Street Military, we gon’ get it started, yeah

Welcome to my show, I’ll be your host
 and my guest tonight in the studio
It’s foolio, let us begin by looking at the screen with something in your life
Got hung like Saddam when you chose that mic
I’m representing the tradition of The Coalition
Shot the head off  fishing
I master Chef Hell’s Kitchen in South Park
I season emcee’s vertebrae, skilled in culinary arts
Mutilate, digest parts, seep in carbon monoxide farts
I smell pure under formaldehyde like killer sharks
Would you like to phone a friend?
Emcee’ll wait for slaughter like hogs
When I threw a  dripping in blood for the cover of Murder Dog

I’m back and fully loaded, martial law ‘round here
Kill snitches, b*tch ni**as got respect ‘round here
Give a f*ck who you is, you get did ‘round here
Crips, Bloods, gorillas, yeah your G ‘round here
 diamond bezel got pulled ‘round here
Eses, vatos, locos, Southwest ‘round here
Hot boys get cold shoulders, you make real down here
You walkin’ around scoffing like you  like them
Get your mind right, ni**a, you’s a thief I swear
It took a little time to see what size you wear
It’s real in the field, boys  be aware
Surround sound in the , guerrillas on warfare
Want all beat-bangers, on site to strike right
Don’t laugh on you ni**as ’til you ni**as get it right
Got called on a banger, we banged on the banger
Got five Gs, we show no love for the banger

Murdering mankind with frankincense and myrrh
Coalition with brethren stay intention all concur
Finishing fishermen and people in with 
 mental states that are unsure and impure
Just ring the alarm and bring physical harm
Against all weapons formed that defy the arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Try to battle I, you die, i.e. end up dead
Swore it’s the spread to plague from words said
Bodies bled with legs overextended and stretched
Like , left your dome home like overdrawn American Express
Less to bless by destroying your mutilated mess
With melatonin and melanin from the solar plex

Aight check this out man, we havin’ a little layover right now, we on our way to murder, but we had to stop off at serious injury, so strap up ‘cause the rest of this flight is nonstop, c’mon

My flows cause an explosion in the minds of the unwise
Dumb, deaf and blind fell victim to the real 9
Ether tried, told you devils in the last rhyme
Was the last time, that crooked cop, we blast nine
And even when the last nine bullets hit your flesh
Only then will they confess, believing  what a mess
And now we forced to rebuild the knowledge they killed
Terrorize the mind and put they children in the field
Then only then will they yield
Disagreeable against agreeable
You say you rule the world, we made it breathable, livable
Gods at every interval
With a team of Elohim that’s ready to get rid of you
Quick as a millisecond recorded in real time
Which makes me the first in the last of every damn rhyme
I ain’t trippin’, I’m spittin’ the facts easy
I can’t leave these lames alone, they brains need me

 to his knees,  drop him with ease
 freeze
Something for the heads 
It’s gon’ be  way beyond a misdemeanor
Impeaching you,  control-alt-deleting you
Shutting you down and restarting
 like Steve Martin
That’s the point you drove me to so now the attack is full scale
 since ’74  watch how you inhale
You already know your time was up, you tryna stall
Not realizing that those same playas are hastening your fall
I’ma show you, step to your house and overthrow you
Plant a red, black and green flag in the middle of the Oval

M-u-r-d-e-r O-n-e, multiple charge murderers
Murder One, dawg, I break haters that buck
Still though I spin verses when done I go and f*ck
Overlooked because I won’t turn the other cheek
The weak spring leaks, the hood listen when I speak
From overseas around the globe back to H-Town
 lay it down
I have four more shots out of my 16 rounder
You rather f*ck with a  than f*ck with a three hundred pounder
I’m M One, homie, now tell me what good with it
It’s a multiple choice murder and I’m so hood with it

Multiple choice murder, no ABC format
With flows that are hotter than hell’s thermostat
What was that? I know you ain’t sayin’ nothin’
Lyrical assassination once your ass get to bumpin’
It’s SPC to the end ‘cause I’m the brother from South Park
Killed you on this track, outlined you in chalk
And if you wanted , that sh*t wouldn’t be hard
I talk about that Escalade or the Jag in the yard
Yeah I’m still Rapper K, ain’t kicked a rhyme in a minute
XXL Magazine, I know you saw your boy in it
You probably tore out that page, you probably threw it away
But then your gal went back and bought it the very next day

I guess they murder mentally, physically and spiritually
But in the end there’s a penalty
My people don’t know they kin to me
But time is near so they finna be
Knowing that multiple murder will awaken the gods, finna be showin’
If on the scene mug mean and they green life finna be glowin’
But as of now most of us dead
Every Sunday praying with a cross overhead to a god that kept us enslaved
Murdered your ancestors and put the same cross on they grave
Most highest child, nothing can hurt us
You bust, we bust back, b*tch, multiple murders

Walk with me
I defy the law of averages
I’m totally against your flow like gay marriages
You think you better, put a slug on it
Wrap your ass with the extension cord, the part with the plug on it
I slap yo cap, bro
’til your naps grow from being low to a Jackson 5 afro
I saw you take off when the drama came
Credit so bad you gon’ have to put this ass-whoopin’ in yo mama name
The chances of me giving you a pardon
Are like the chances of Rush Limbaugh fit in the drawers he wore in kindergarten
Do you feel what I’m saying, man?
I finally hit the weed (What?!) Haha, y’all know I’m just playin’, man

The wrong moves will get you caught up, rest will get you set up
Snitches will get you sent up, straight up
F*ckin’ with ni**as you don’t know that’s f*ckin’ with ni**as they don’t know
Can’t nothing good come out of that
Never seen him before running up, busting his gat
Seem like he know who he after but he don’t know where he at
The big pretender got a message to send ya
Thanks for the invite, now return to sender
When you doin’ bad, ni**as try to do ya bad
When you’re gettin’ money, ni**as try to do ya ass
Smile in your face like everything gravy
All in my grill, what up, Blank, baby?

I strike tandems at random like Manson
With deadly  and all mics are abandoned
I’m Mr. Handsome and I play madams like backgammon
Give all  f*ckin’ back spasms
Split all their atoms like the damn phantoms
Hold their grandsons for ransom
I cause earth chasms when I have an orgasm
I give birth to word patterns and squirt my f*ckin’ verbs at ‘em
From the cytoplasm and this micro action
I’m relaxing in a fashion that causes the distraction with my tight flow 
Cuttin’  from ni**as of attraction
I might go into an Anglo Saxon, f*ckin’ bashing

Murdering, we got multiple licks, ultimate clique
Ya hear? Sh*t, we will alter that b*tch
So what you want in life? A gun, a knife?
Husband and wife, the real or 
It don’t matter, ma’am, I’m a batter ram
Coming through the door, watch ‘em scatter, man
Doing it for years, so sincere
We will lyricists, please don’t come near
It’s our cue, man, I thought you knew, man
My style is the way I f*ckin’ do thangs
On some gutter sh*t like your mother, b*tch
Recognize it’s not another clique

Cunning, gunning, stunning
Motherf*ckers steady busting sh*t
Trapping, capping, slapping
Ni**as steady jumping on d*ck
Kicking like a chicken, damn right I’m in this b*tch
Wanna f*ckin’ show? Watch me bring on the crunk sh*t
Think I take your back pants’ pockets and stuff with two big bricks
And push your ass off a atop a one  plaza for even thinking you can f*ck with 
The author this particular verbal catalyst
Got the motherf*ckin’ flow of the Tigris and the motherf*ckin’ Euphrates
, from here  to Haiti
High Risk be the type of motherf*cker come banging out
 fist in the air, 

 rounds, shells fall to the grounds
Never givin’ a f*ck, ni**a, I’m down
F*ck around and get caught up in this homicide
I’m tellin’ ya, b*tch, don’t  give a f*ck in a ditch
Where your b*tch ass gon’ lay
And for them ni**as that wanna test me
When you see me on the streets, I’m gon’ spray, no way
You gon’ win against a terrorist
Suicide bomb you if I have to, I don’t miss
Motherf*cker, I blow out your brains
Go to jail and admit it, tell ‘em I’m totally sane
Plead guilty, I feel that I’m the only one who can stop me
And pull the gun on the judge right before he try to pop me
But sometime, I’ma pop his ass with a 9
Millimeter Glock, yeah, f*ck one-time
I’m Dope E, if I’s the word, I put the word in ya
I’m a terrorist serving ya with multiple choice murderers

Now I’ma murder on this beat and it’s gon’ sound so neat
Only got twelve lines so ain’t no time to creep
Got skills to pay the bills so a ni**a gon’ eat
That produces enough time to blow on the sweet
I’ma bomb on you ni**as and I do it from 
Gas knock you dead on yo ass, them ni**as asleep
And y’all gon’ feel this, ain’t no time for a truce

The one who cried  then rolled his eyes like 
I let loose, break my fist in this
Don’t act like y’all don’t know that the  is in this b*tch
Coming with hot lead, won’t stop ’til I’m dead
If the Glock lock, I come out the barrel instead

Half human, half being, a seething demon
 your family, count ‘em out ’til my only reason for breathing
Research if you see a the worst
Ammunition rip through, in memory of you, pictures they put on t-shirts
I flood mine’s with rough rhymes, the bloodline’s diminishing
Travel back through time, destroying his origin and lineage
God forbid he got kids, bearing his likeness and image
‘cause I’m exacting my vengeance on anything having a resemblance
Excluding toddlers and infants, adolescents and women
The autopsies are pending, assembling the parts they are missing
I’m remorseless, brutal torture’s what I’m rendering
My body walked away and my intentions dismembered them

I ain’t wanna do it, K-Rino made me do it
 to the heart, dipped in embalming fluid
B*tch, I’m  Water menace, I murk you with the hammer
I murder your brain, put anthrax in your Tony Montana
I’m hearing killer voices, multiple murder choices
My mug made ‘em nauseous, slap that ni**a unconscious
Aka spray upon the streetlights, 
Them ni**as popped up but they ain’t livin’ thug life
This ni**a had a gun, I had a blade, man
Cut that ni**a wrist off and shot him with his own hand
I let the pump get’cha
Before I hit ya with the bumper jack
This sh*t is guerrilla murder militia

I’m leaving ni**as comatose from overdoses of hypnosis
The ni**a that come closest gon’ get roasted with my vocals
Heavily sedated when the anesthetic set in
This is a verbal assassination whether or not I grab a pen
I will divide and conquer, multiply then stomp ya
Morph into three of me, triangulate to jump ya
I’m surrounded by the leaders of the SPC
I got the force ‘cause I’m protected by the ghost of AC
One ni**a everlasting with a sniper rifle steady blasting
One for the money representing and we steady smashing
Mr. Cap 1 put it down with a four pound when I clown ya
A verbal execution when I got word from the founder

See it be multiple choice murders for the b*tches who be hatin’
 Mike Rucker, see I be murder motivate Gs
I think you want some, go run up and get it
’cause in a minute, your wig, I f*ckin’ split it
I did it, I shoot him in his neck and then I punched him in his chin
Guess you can call this sh*t an uppercut or next of kin
Don’t try to f*ck with me, you way out of your element
 b*tches, just as if I was an elephant
You smellin’ this? Yes it’s gun smoke and you inhaling this
You better get ready ‘cause quick blows I’m swinging heavily
And when I’m done, I leave your ass in South Park
‘cause a multiple choice murder don’t give a f*ck but got heart

It’s a million or more ways to die
Colombian necktie for pool of acids
Snatch faces off foes  Hannibal
Cursed birth to do dirt, I just murk h*es
It’s psychological, diabolical
I gravitate to chaotic situations to throw gasoline on fires
Bust automatics no hesitation, vegetation on cannabis
Like a sleeping giant, clique gotta be violent
Then like a killer be quiet, nine times, 99 and the silences speak
Get a life, that’s what you say to something mortal
Get a knife or a gun before these people see you 
As I flip through corn holes

I’m only motivated by multiple murders
Money and mayhem so gruesome how they found him decaying
Displaying maggots colonating in his intestines
Close range blew his brains with the Winchester
Fire follows the flame out of the barrel
Teflon through your windpipe, your chest and bone marrow
Death’ll come quick as a sparrow, bury you in a wheel barrow
Blacker than  apparel you gon’t need some pallbearers
Even though I ride for the SPC, I ain’t no gangbanger
I have that ass coming back to haunt me like a doppelgänger
Brain-dangling, even web-tangling, there’s no stranger
Do you with my bare hands, off you like that Boston Strangler
Klondike Kat gon’ open you wide, no need for stitches
I bury you’s guys, I told you you sleep with the fishes
Malicious vicious intentions, ghostly killers from different dimensions
Multiple lacerations from deadly incisions

Soldier in these streets and doin’ what I supposed to
Life in the hood like riding a rollercoaster
One day you’re on your note, next day your ass on a roaster
Ni**a tryna cut my bread, I got to toaster
And just because you see my face on a poster
Don’t ever think that I won’t pull it out my holster
Gangsta ass ni**a on a gangsta ass bass line
Out of H-Town  in the waistline
Guests stole my rhymes with no FaceTime
Like a greyhound, I’m gon’ chase mine
These ni**as out here showing off with they guns
Bust that b*tch in the chest, I bet he cough up a lung
These ni**as already know what I’m on
It’s been a few years but I can still slaughter a song",https://genius.com/K-rino-multiple-choice-murders-lyrics

Been in the system
Got somebody in there right now

If you locked up or ever been there, this is my sentiment
We riding for ya matters if you guilty or ya innocent
We goin' keep on writing this ending brand randomly
Five months or fifteen years we still family
The man in need won't let me sell you out and go phone in
Times like this is when you discover your real homies
Partnas that I barely kept on that guilt is still on me
Seeming like the world forgot you that feeling is real lonely
It ain't easy on ya mamma, you knowing that she hating listen
By the way, put my name on ya visitation list
So I can come through holla, and chop it up with'cha
I ain't been going out to much but I'm a get'cha some pictures
Yeah it seems bad right now but continue to strive
Cause we goin' tear this city up the second that you arrive
Boys is still posting up on these blocks tryna beat 'em
Honestly you ain't missing nothing but family and freedom

I'll see you when you make it back
(See you when you make it back)
I'm hoping that you knowing where the love is at
(I'm hoping that you knowing where the love is at, homie)
I'll guess I'll see you when you make it home
(Ha-ha, see you when you make it home)
Until that day try to hold on
(Keep your head up mayne, we ain't forgot about ya, yeah)

You gotta good family and a young son who loves you
He so big one day I saw him and thought he was you
I'm just playing, but on the cool homie that time flew
At least to me, but I guess I can't judge you for yo view
When you ask about your girl in the last latter you sealed
You told me to keep it straight real no matter the deal
Well the truth is it's been two years, she gotta dude and they together
Man you couldn't expected her to wait forever
And I heard that he treating her good and that she trust him
Plus you know that if he ever go left we will touch 'em
I know it probly hurts to read that but she was patient
Gotta charted to the game in circumstances situation
Use your time wisely emotions can be misleading
Conspirituality feeding your soul, praying, and reading
See yeah they got'cha flesh at the moment bit don't sweat 'em
They can only incarcerate your mental if you let em

I'll see you when you make it back
(See you when you make it back)
I'm hoping that you knowing where the love is at
(I'm hoping that you knowing where the love is at, homie)
I'll guess I'll see you when you make it home
(Ha-ha, see you when you make it home)
Until that day try to hold on
(Keep your head up mayne, we ain't forgot about ya, yeah)

We can't forget about our sisters in jail, we got'chu
Those with kids who did what they felt necessary to do
It ain't my place to speculate, throw stones or judge
Whatever it was we knowing you did it out of love
And those who broke multiple laws
Nobody talks about the number of minority women behind bars
What happen ain't none of your business, mine yours
Everybody wanna stereotype em and find flaws
But never let em say you not a queen, she say she looking rough now
But she goin' shut it down once she hit the scene
And I believe her, state jail or county it's aight
Taking classes cause she seeking something better for her life
And I notice she goin' get it cause she learn from her past
Tired of talking to her people and her children through a glass
But even if you doing time and you never coming home
Besides God you always got somebody to call on, feel it

I'll see you when you make it back
(See you when you make it back)
I'm hoping that you knowing where the love is at
(I'm hoping that you knowing where the love is at, homie)
I'll guess I'll see you when you make it home
(Ha-ha, see you when you make it home)
Until that day try to hold on
(Keep your head up mayne, we ain't forgot about ya, yeah)

Too everybody on every unit
State jail, county jail
All the political prisoners
Errbody that was falsely accused
Male or female
Whether you did it or not mayne, we ridin' with'cha
Cause we know the system is corrupt
And all they wanna do is lock us up

No Coward,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0," scared man, scared of what?
Ain't got no reason to be scared of nothin' man
Step up to the plate man, do what you gotta do man
Regardless of what's goin' on

I guess you taken me as weak
I ain't no gangster, but I came up in these streets
Yeah you big, but you can get your big ass beat
You tryna punk me, I'ma go have to hit delete
And I runnin' even if you brought your dudes
They tellin' folks you got a problem with me, cool
'Round here sayin' they gon' jump me after school
You ain't got to look for me 'cause I'ma look for you
Don't send no messages, come tell me face to face
That hard talkin' ain't gon' put me on no skates
You say you 'bout to give me work if that's the case
Then ain't no use in lettin' that action go to waste
Think I'm a punk, then alright pardner come and see
No need for arguin' if that's how it's gon' be
Ain't nothin' soft about me, it's a fact that I'm a G

People try to check you just to see where you stand
A punk is what they'll try to make you be if they can
And fightin' back mentions your degree as a man
And messy people show up just to see if you ran
Then run back to the hood so they can laugh and sling dirt
But all you got to do is show up with the mind to bring hurt
And believe me when I try to tell you that these things work
Don't be doin' a bunch of talkin', just walk up and swing first
When they underestimate ya, slap, slap, leave them served
Man I love to see a bully take a nap on the curb
Don't get caught up on no words, let 'em talk 'till they red
But if they violate your space, knock the scalp off of they head
Knock the skin off of his skull, make him do five to eight flips
Beat the hair off his body, slap the  and not his lips
They gon' see that day up in that grease when you don't run
Gotta show them they messed around and picked the wrong one

There'll be no coward
Never have never will be no coward

Turned your music up and looked the other way like you ain't see it
Didn't say nothin', no words, no kind of efforts to stopping 'em
Three old ladies defended her and you just stood their watchin' 'em
When somebody come challenge your manhood what you gonna do?
A dude just slapped your woman on the booty right in front of you
And she lookin' at you, but you let the dude move on
And got the nerve to talk crazy to her when y'all get home
That ain't real G, deep down in your heart you feelin' guilty
'Cause when it look like danger your draws start gettin' milky
You can't fight then it's okay but you can't be a coward period
If you scared call the police, I ain't sayin' a phrase, I'm serious
You a chump with a streak right down your back just like a skunk
You think your children gon' respect you if they daddy is a punk
Face your fear, trust in G.O.D, promise you'll prevail
Got to stand up like a man even if you take the L

If It Wasn’t For You,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"In these days and times
Man, I can’t put it into words
Gotta give credit where it’s due
Man, if it wasn’t for you, you know what I’d be, any of us
All praises due to Allah

I’m no different, I’m the same as a lot of men
But your hand’s the only one that I can put my problems in
I appreciate all the blessings that you be droppin’ in
And helping me out of every situation that I was in
I can’t thank you enough for being patient with
Me being evasive, complaining in my ungratefulness
The times you made a way for me when I was paperless
And all I had to do was pray for it, no need to make a wish
Then with God speed, velocity I’m blessed
An eternal amount of words could never properly express
I’m tryna overcome my slippin’ and rebellion
And wipe my slate clean of every duty that I failed in
And if I please you what men think don’t matter then
‘cause any status granted by man pales in comparison
Want you to know that forever that these are words that I’ll
Never change, signed K-Rino, your imperfect child

If it wasn’t for you, I would be a misguided soul
I appreciate the gifts that you allowed me to hold
And if I lost it all tomorrow, still you I would choose
Because if not for you, I wouldn’t’ve had possessions to lose
If it wasn’t for you, I would be a misguided soul
I appreciate the gifts that you allowed me to hold
And if I lost it all tomorrow, still you I would choose
Because if not for you, I wouldn’t’ve had possessions to lose

They say you work in mysterious ways
It ain’t mysterious, we hear you when our spirit is raised
As I travel through the darkness among these strangers
You navigated me past all the unseen dangers
And I didn’t fall short, I fell far to new depths
But I’m wise enough to know that you guided this fool’s steps
Pullin’ me up and then helpin’ me out of the trouble
A lot of people turn on you as soon as they face the struggle
But Jesus was a prophet, you made it tough for him
So if they choose not to believe in you, that’s up to them
So I submit no matter how hard it get
And I can’t lie, it’s been a lot of times I wanted to quit
I remember one day complaining ‘bout my life and its facets
‘bout how bad I was doin’ and how hard that I had it
Then you humbled me at a corner store when I passed it
Saw a homeless family walkin’, pushin’ a basket, sayin’

If it wasn’t for you, I would be a misguided soul
I appreciate the gifts that you allowed me to hold
And if I lost it all tomorrow, still you I would choose
Because if not for you, I wouldn’t’ve had possessions to lose
If it wasn’t for you, I would be a misguided soul
I appreciate the gifts that you allowed me to hold
And if I lost it all tomorrow, still you I would choose
Because if not for you, I wouldn’t’ve had possessions to lose

When I can’t confide in nobody, you willing to listen
Providing solutions to problems when answers are missing
You helped me go to war with all the ratchetness in my system
All those I’ll-never-do-it-agains if you just get me through this one
So it’s necessary I pray each and every day
Thankin’ him for a ton of things that I can never repay
You either with him or you not with him, no areas gray
A man is judged by how much his sins and charities weigh
All the times that you saved me, nothing should cause doubt
Non-coincidental last minute blessings I lost count
If living to be a thousand, I could do such
And you never do nothing else for me, you did too much
And if I never reach the level of a breakthrough star
I’m just grateful that I get to see how great you are
The world might say I’m nothing but accept that never
I look in the mirror and see the most blessed man ever

If it wasn’t for you, I would be a misguided soul
I appreciate the gifts that you allowed me to hold
And if I lost it all tomorrow, still you I would choose
Because if not for you, I wouldn’t’ve had possessions to lose
If it wasn’t for you, I would be a misguided soul
I appreciate the gifts that you allowed me to hold
And if I lost it all tomorrow, still you I would choose
Because if not for you, I wouldn’t’ve had possessions to lose",https://genius.com/K-rino-if-it-wasnt-for-you-lyrics
Boom!!!,"Musiquarium, Vol. 2",UnKnown,"Yeah, I'm in a good mood
We're gon' go in a little harder

See, I'm the farthest thing from a talkative novice
The sovereign artist, the walking thesaurus
I'm heartless so I'm gonna stomp him regardless
His esophagus is swole' like he swallowed a walrus
Every two or three hours I break four cliques
Even after he dies give him eight more licks
Busting into their houses with straight door kicks
Disfigure you like blindfolded skateboard tricks
And it's too true that K-Rino got a few screws loose
Connected to my ears a Jupiter size Bluetooth
Choked out, hands untainted too when I finish you
And when I'm through the hardest men'll pause like women do
It's not a act, I was born real
Drag you through a corn field and pull the flesh off you like a orange peel
I got you jumping and blocking like Pop Lockers
International watching a continent hopscotcher
I hear your heartbeat without using a stethoscope
I'm forever dope tying heads to a tether rope
The man that I booed said, ""Damn, he was rude""
I strike like wrong answers on Family Feud
Tryna bang with us is dangerous
Like mixing baby formula with angel dust
I'm intellectually heavy and my brain's a bus
When you walk outta your house it will be raining trucks
Apparently you don't seem to get it, whip you with a single lyric
And make the shit look like a hyena did it
It's addictive when you start to flame tracks
That's why every rapper who ever retired came back
I'm 16 levels past danger, I'm the mast stranger
With the clothes hanger baby-momma ass mangler
My tame mood change into fast anger
The same dude who locked the warden in the gas chamber
Self-abduction, the sickening process
I don't even know where I'm holding myself hostage
Wondered how I do it but no answer was there
Gagged my mouth after tying both my hands to a chair
When I preform you got every right to get alarmed
Find you and whoop your ass with a severed off midget arm
I put you so far up in the ground, it's true
That people in the lowest part of Hell can look down at you",https://genius.com/K-rino-boom-lyrics

When the hatred is masked with laughing
Every move that you make they watching it
Saying one thing but doing the opposite

I’m pissed off and my patience is short
All the heartless people circulating ‘round me, things just ain’t what I thought
This book is played, time to start a new page, caught in a maze
Never seen so many hateful ways in all of my days
Easy to read, I see this everyday
If it’s so wrong and you complain about a person’s actions, why do you stay?
You walk around at holding a cross, low and distraught
How can you hope that I find you if I don’t know that you’re lost?
Tired of only being linked to the conniving and phony
People hanging with ya all your life, disguised as your homies
They mind is sick, like a person ‘bout to die from pneumonia
Ran together, turning corners, now they riding up on ya
Plotted on by the ones you known since you was born
Best man at your wedding, now he wishing you harm
Loyalty nowhere in the mind, you don’t notice it though
They act one way when they around ya, when they leave ya, they show

Partners be telling lies, acting like they known to support
When it get real, they be on side him like a phone up in court
I’m tryna grow to where my dreams are too strong to abort
In the hood, blasting out somebody’s dome is a sport
Facing the everyday pressure of life’s stressful demands
But the stronger the mind is, the more successful your plans
Even to run a special blessings is a test for a man
Your money count is only based on where the decimal lands
Society’s double standards, I ain’t fit in ‘em
I get locked up for whoopin’ my own child but police get away with killin’ ‘em
Our history’s been ravaged and crushed
You want sympathy for your past but telling me forget what happened to us
I guess you thought we was gon’ let you walk around
Stalking us all over town
Now the whole city’s scared ‘cause you the target now
They shoot us down and never say freeze
For killing nine blacks, Dillon got a Whopper with cheese, please
That’s hypocrisy

You want inclusion in a system built for keeping you out
That’s like begging a murderer to let you sleep in his house
Messages programmed in your head, deeply embedded
So now he follow everything you said just ‘cause you said it
Believe in fairytales for years is what prevented our rise
We sent our babies to the public school to memorize lies
You wanna be up in our mix, but you don’t like us in yours
They won’t hire you on a job but you can fight in they wars
Shoutout to Harriet, they tryin’ to diminish her purpose
They wanna put her face on money that’s about to be worthless
You celebrating like them doing that is making them realer
Betraying truth for the smiles and handshakes of a killer
Hoping to win, envisioning how that mighta been

Y'all couldn't tame me, so you stain me
You set me up, so if I blow up your fucking car, don't blame me
From the city to the county to the state pen
To the middle ward with all of the great men
Charles Manson and et cetera
Malicious manipulated miraculous mass murderer
Hard luck was born around me
Social setbacks, financial depression mentally drowns me
I had a dream a cop tried to follow me
Pulled out a gun full of bullets and made him swallow three
Backup came, I shot a 50 in a clutch
Getting hit by 49, I must be losing my touch
Woke up sweating with the premonition
He's a shark and my blade's a hook, time to do some ho fishing
If I go to the White House, I'm willing to bet with no sweat
I could feel my motherfucking neck
Why work at Jack in the Box
When I can make a grand a day just by packing the rocks
Keep popping the shit you talk
I'll drive a truck in that asshole quick, then parallel park

I'm caught in a lifetime sentence, yeah prejudiced set-up
Even if I'm locked up I'll never let up
I'm mentally scarred from the punishment
Society kept me in bondage for years now it's done again
I dropped out in the tenth, never could go the length
Because the white education was never meant
Thought I was rough, now my reel I'm reading
Born with a bullet in my chest, trunk and bleeding
Nobody read me, my leader misled me
I straight up broke the damn hand that fed me
Cold killed a cop, knocked him out till his head split
Whooped him till he woke up and said, ""Man I'm dead, shit""
When he come. I'm a brass knuckle bricker bomb
Tricks in my mix getting chewed like a stick of gum
Going through ya chest like a raygun
Been the main target of a social conspiracy since day one
I ain't calm yet, you jet when my palm sweats
Cannons and bullets, firing squads and bomb threats
Wrapped in a cell block, trapped in a jail lock
Sold rock, guns cocked, the mirrors in shell shock
Shit, got two kids, a son and a daughter
But my gal lost it so she replaced a restraining order
Living life with cops steady grabbing me
The biggest mistake my momma made was having me
Walking the path quick, South Park first round draft pick
Half sick, I'm hard as a math trick
Dangerous, a brother you don't trust
The type to get a gun and just unload on a school bus
When I was ten they should have signed a document
Making me a permanent boy's home occupant
They say vote for a prez who's equipped
But why pick a captain if he can't steer the damn ship
The whole moral of these little tales
Is to display that the unnecessary bullshit still prevails
And that's wack life but you ain't gotta listen

I’m seein’ how they look at me and plottin’ on me crookedly
They watch my steps then go against the grain
Now when I come around these cats, I always hear ‘em claiming that
They got love and they hope that I succeed
But when it gets real, no reply, that’s how I know it’s all a lie
They never help you in your time of need
See haters ain’t your only foes, the worse ones be the folks you know
So trusting few is always best to do
The ones that’s glancing at your throat who tend to hold you back the most
Could be that person sleeping next to you
Now people look at you and laugh while wishing they had what you had
They do it ‘cause their self image is low
And since misery loves company, your pain is what you want from me
But no thanks, I can’t share that with you bro, so I’ma let ya know

He never thought the stress degree would creep up unexpectedly
You’re winding down, your breaths are short
You overlooked those lessons taught
These days God is testing hearts, your actions manifest your thoughts
Spend your whole life tryna catch folks slippin’
Nine times out of ten it’s crumbs you was flippin’
You ain’t never wrong, everybody else trippin’
You’re saying one thing but you’re doing something different
Your demeanor’s rude and ruthless, gettin’ through to you is useless
Your ways are not conducive so I choose to be reclusive
But just because you share disgust, another’s hopes not fair to crush
You’re heartless, you don’t care enough, my problem is I care too much
And when that happens, guess what’s next, snakes try to put your kindness to the test
Take what you give ‘em then ask for the rest, show they real colors when the matter is addressed
I can tell when a person is less than true, I don’t even have to take a second view
You the reason why they not respecting you ‘cause people only do what you let them do

Your love connection faded fast, trust and cares in the past
And over time the hatred seemed to grow
‘Cause now it’s just like shattered glass, it’s almost like they wore a mask
And now they not the one you used to know
And at first it was all fun and games ’til struggles came and people change
And now you’re like two trains on different tracks
So you start to wonder how it is, somebody that you’ve know for years
Could flip the script and stab you in yo back
And in that heat the ice will melt, you helped the cause and played yourself
And now you coming with that same excuse
No self respect and no self worth just makes the situation worse
So don’t contribute to your own abuse

Mama real too, through them I developed two kinds of love
One for that street life but the other for peace
But the two can’t live together, so inside I’m a beast
I’m mystified by the cash flow that I never seen
Partners coming up doing dirt while I’m broke living clean
Know what I mean? Picture being on the cut walking
What I thought was just my conscience on the cool was just the law talking
Telling me I need to live my life legitimate
I’m in the Mr Fiends with money tryna get a hit
I block him out, snatch the paper, pass the rock and shout
""Get off my corner"", any shiest manoeuvres, knock him out
No more school, I’m dropping out, pockets popping out
Everything new, me and the crew, yeah I’m talking about that..

Street life, hustling for a living
Street life, taking never giving

Tryna find a way to make it better
Knowing I- we’ve been doing this forever
So I’m down for whatever
The world is making it hard on me

Got to flip my game 360 degrees

Am I a hypocrite for putting dope money in church?
Through the bad I’m tryna do some good
This brother told me when you come up, open up a business in the hood
Never did ‘cause I let the streets make me hard
My mama threw up her hands and said, “Take me Lord”
When she found that sack in my room full of crack
She made me raise out the crib and said, “Don’t come back”
Didn’t faze me ‘cause I knew that the game pays me
Mama brought me in the world but the hood raised me
I’m just a teen tryna live good so understand
Caught in-between a mind of childhood and being a man
I’m losing touch bur never lost the love for the game
My partners feel me ‘cause they going through the same in that…

Street life, hustling for a living
Street life, taking never giving
All night, tryna ease the pain I’m feeling
The world is making it hard on me
Tryna find a way to make it better
Knowing I- we’ve been doing this forever
So I’m down for whatever
The world is making it hard on me

Picture all them crack pipes with nobody lighting
Picture blacks at a club and nobody fighting
Picture everybody paid with no bother
Picture all babies growing up with a father
I had to stay paid so dirt was my alternative
Went to the Mosque, they told me that I need to learn to live
Positive and never disrespect my own
How the Hell we call ourselves grown and live at home
With mama starting drama talking back and throwing a fit
You better love her while she here ‘cause when she’s gone that’s it
You’re feeling like you wanna change but the chance is slim
You got two kids now you’re tryna live your life through them
Hoping they don’t make the same mistake you made and fail
It took them years to know it’s hard to raise a son in jail
Ain’t nothing new to K-Rino, man I know all about that
We need to unite and do right and raise up out that…

Street life, hustling for a living
Street life, taking never giving
All night, tryna ease the pain I’m feeling
The world is making it hard on me
Tryna find a way to make it better
Knowing I- we’ve been doing this forever
So I’m down for whatever
The world is making it hard on me",https://genius.com/K-rino-street-life-lyrics
Life and Death,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"And seeing the multitudes, he went up on a mountain
And when he was seated the disciples came to him
Then he opened his mouth and taught them, saying
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven
Blessed are they who mourn, for they shall be comforted
Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled
Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the sons of God, yeah

When I get heated, I start swinging with my right and my left
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death
Seeking higher level wisdom to enlighten myself
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death

You can't expect people to do what you would do for them
All that you can do is keep it true and speak the truth to them
Recognize defectors on the spot and outmanoeuvre them
Understand in life you ain't got nothing to prove to them
We living in corrupt days, wicked ways and rough times
Abortion, deranged minds and 'nough crimes
When Death come he left some searching to find
Replacements are in deep space left behind
Every day I live to see for me is victory
All men are born in sin and shaped in iniquity
During dangerous time you get a sign of 'em
Understand the world is ending and you out here living life like you got 9 of 'em
Ah, I peeped the jail and I see the system is real filthy
I pray to God to bless the innocent ones and forgive the guilty
As I slip through Revelations, not many pages are left
Mental, physical and spiritual are the three stages of death

When I get heated, I start swinging with my right and my left
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death
Seeking higher level wisdom to enlighten myself
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death

I now pronounce you man and wife
You may kiss the bride now homie and begin your new standard life
Y'all visualize eternity but didn't see
It ended fast and didn't last because a marriage is 
And it's irrelevent the fact that you wasn't scared of it
No union or organisation can survive unless God is at the head of it
And the purpose of a lifelong commitment you're now defeating
What a sin, two months in and both of y'all already cheating
So in due time we find out the whole thing was fraud
Violated the vows you stated in the eyes of the Lord
And she don't wanna stay and all the love you had has gone away
But it ain't over yet 'cause now a baby is on the way
The game changes, it's all pain and no smiles
Can't let the hate y'all got for one another effect the young child
And if it got to end, at least be able to say that you tried
Instead of tryna work it out, y'all walked away and love died

When I get heated, I start swinging with my right and my left
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death
Seeking higher level wisdom to enlighten myself
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death

Now he woke up this morning with blood on his mind
Thinking about his dead partner so he loads up his .9
It's been a month since the funeral but he still ain't stopped crying
No logic in his heart because revenge got him blind
He can't see past the hate and now his own life on the line
Stepping back out on the street and looking to kill his own kind
It didn't unfold like he thought it would and he ended up dying
Now instead of one lost life, now theres two families crying
It been stated life can't be duplicated
To up a room and wait for any who assume you made it because of wealth accumulated
A lifestyle of living wild in denile
A woman smoking while she's carrying a child, you know that's genocide
He ain't no better 'cause he'll hit or raper her
And make her sell her precious body for some pretty paper
I hold my mirror up because I ain't who I seek to be
Yeah, I'm still struggling so when I speak to you, I speak to me

Tell me another one
Lord, could be another one

When I get heated, I start swinging with my right and my left
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death
Seeking higher level wisdom to enlighten myself
The only thing a man is promised is his life and his death

Do or Die,Danger Zone,1995.0,"Yo, you can give a man a brain but will he think?
I give him water like the rain but will he drink?
I hit the punk with everything but the kitchen sink
The Universe is like a chain, I'm the missing link
Every time I open up my book
I'm reading with my eyes but I use my mind to look
Seeing with my intellect I travel to the deep
My brain draws a picture even when I'm fast asleep
Sketching, like an architect, a building made of thoughts
Comprehending wisdom years before it's even taught
Talent makes the master kick a rap or even scene
The writer metamorphosize into Stephen King
Time is running out but I won't let 'em see the clock
Decipher spirit codes and the take the form of kilo rock
Conditions make me realise that niggas coming soon
Got hype in outerspace and rode around across the Moon
Vocally I'm powerful, I catapult through space
Words disintegrate aver a tonne of toxic waste
Physically as well as mathematically precise
Yesterday a psychic called and asked me for advice
K-Rino is too aerodynamically equipped
Witness a rage he stage, niggas pages ripped
Vocals I dissimulate the victim like they're slow

Takeover,Book Number 7,UnKnown,"O-R-I-G- I-N-A-T O-R
Describe K-Rino and N-I-P
Burying new jacks, beating them blue/black
I stack a rapper anatomy higher than two shacks
In the meantime K is throttling minds
Move fast you couldn't catchup if you was a bottle of Heinz
Still spitting about 24s, hoes and bitches
Man you washed up like former dirty clothes and dishes


I execute in 3D, the poltergeist in the TV
Invisible hand that slaps you when you turn off the CD
You're bye bye poppa the second you try to step to me
Tight game included, these nuts are sold separately
Systematically quick and graphically seal the fate of them
Me and Gangsta NIP beat a 188 of them
Hourly accosted with dangerous diagnostics
Took the ransom money and still murdered the hostage


We travel land that stand for the Dandy Atlantic span
Lyrical Taliban, South Park, Afghanistan
You signed a contract now you think you're fly
But you lost your damn deal before the ink could dry
I'm in the room calculating all the rap fatalities
On a three-way phone call with my other two personalities
I ain't holding back on the drama they needed

The End,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"Oh yeah
Time is up
All y’all emcees, y’all had a good run
No more time, this is it
Let me tell you
You can’t hide from the wondrous designs that my mind do
You could be in another country, I’ll reach out and clothesline you
I’m not responsible for one fool that I run through
When you come to, you’ll catch me tryna unscrew your tonsils
My open folder resembles a gun show
‘cause it unloads out of control ammo, one flow crushes the console
Red liquid I scoop out’cha like punch bowls
I was comprehending incomprehensible untold wisdom at a month old
I hold tournaments in different languages
Dangerous entanglements with me versus my brain as the main event
I like to wear a Jason mask when the mic is there
My type is rare, I’m so deranged I’ll push you up a flight of stairs
I’m using cyclone mic drones in my flight zone
When I’m around it’s so scary the dark sleeps with the lights on
I split cement, what you spit’s anemic
People bringing hands to gunfights, I’m bringing harpoons to disagreements
The next sequence will be tense
I process time so fast, a thousand years ago to me seems recent
And I release at nano-speeds, landing hands on these emcees
So when they say cheese, their teeth look like piano keys
I was conceived into 29 families and built my stamina feeding on sweet animate mammaries
Thoughts so high that they massage the sun
Emcees come to me to learn styles upon styles like I’m Olajuwon
I got some pages they can trade between ‘em
Haters in my basement steamin’, crazy, it’s been ages since their neighbors seen ‘em
Hellafied bars in this black new mic I’m breathing
Soon as I see your face, I’m going at you like I’m sneezing
My feet massively pound, so when I hit brakes, I’m smashin’ ‘em down so hard that they blast through the ground
Ideas escape from my brain’s majestic gates and transfigurate into sharp triangular geometric shapes
That race through space at a hectic pace, excavating and wrecking states, decimating the earth’s tectonic plates
The mic I hold’s a striking cobra
I might explode into a solar lightening bolt, the level right below a hyper nova
I make ‘em scatter like a pistol pop, to wipe me out there is a plot
Meanwhile I got your grandpa in a scissor lock
My analogies be passing regions where the wormhole gases be, leaping with supernatural verticality
Come after me you gotta be packed with audacity
A question mark won’t even end a sentence without asking me
Insatiable great untraceable evasive moves capable of sneaking up from behind you while I was facing you
I take various trips through great barriers while carrying a magic lariat to snatch you out your safe areas
I made ‘em take you off the respirator, persuaded the lead investigator’s case ‘cause he owed me a special favor
Come along and watch K wreck and bury everybody in the place like Sissy Spacek in Carrie
This set possesses high risk threats

Opening Statement,The Blood Doctrine,2008.0,"What up? Everytime we do this we gotta make sure we do it right
Ain't no time for playing
So I'ma shoutout to everybody that don't like me
And I hate you too believe that

I'm oblivious to punishment, rarely I show pain
I'm like heroin and crystal meth, acid and cocaine
I'm that man who's in your house waiting for you to throw the lights
Under your bed hoping to strike like that clown or poltergeist
I'm that fate you couldn't dodge, the bullet permanently lodged
The carbon monoxide that helps you kill yourself in your garage
I'm the roadblock that impede ya, who can telepathically read ya
The physician that intentionally messed up your procedure
I'm the sorcerer, the witch doctor, the medicine concocter
I'm a human octopus being, the electric eel shocker
My drug is a verbal slug that might distort blood
The wicked hand that firmly wrapped around your life support plug
I'm the ghost man who holds your existence in his hand
Perched in the neck of the hour glass, the final grain of sand
The professional who speaks words of action to the beast
I'm the priest who heard you but showed no compassion in the least
I'll forever be the lead, my breed  heavily degreed
I bring phrases that experts say can never be conceived
Those who step to me, get bladed, brainwaves cleverly invaded
I got arrays of weaponry so days of jeopardy enslaved him
For my phone because I'm always hunting new things I can grab
No time for rapping about my clothes or platinum chains that I don't have
Equipping the grain to drive and smash, selling cocaine and flexing abs
Making it rain and running tabs, I'ma spit flames and burn up last
And that's finished

I want to shoutout God/Allah
The whole South Park Coalition
What's up K.O.? What's up K-Water?
Shoutout to the N.O.I
MacGregor Park
, Alaska, Germany, France, the whole world
Shoutout to the homie Malik
All the OGs, the homies in jail
The hustlers on every block around the world
What up Z-Ro? What up Tre?

No Walls,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"No roof, no walls, no , no halls
No roof, no walls, no , no halls

Imagining having no way to get warm when it’s cold
And when it’s hot, there’s no escape from heat when temperatures grow
Feeling hopeless and depressed is just a part of the deal
And you become dependent on strangers for water and meals
Every night you’re sleeping on streets that ain’t even safe
No bathrooms available, you can’t even bathe
So you struggle through the long day with low hygiene
On top of that you barely got clothes and those not clean
People walk and drive by you, displaying their blessings
And it’s rare when any of ‘em acknowledge your presence
They just keep going, showing no regard for the poor
You’ve been there so long, they don’t even notice no more
When I see ‘em on the city streets, what does it mean to me?
The image of people suffering is part of the scenery
Watching it up close is heartbreaking without a doubt
The part of society everybody forgot about ‘cause they got

No roof, no walls, no rooms, no halls
Hope you understanding the message I’m tryna show y’all, it's
No roof, no walls, no rooms, no halls
Hope you understanding the message I’m tryna show y’all
Tell me why
People always pass me by (every single day, every single night)
’til we die
They see us and they still deny (C'mon, yeah)

Everyday morale decreases the deeper they drown
You look down on ‘em and not because they sleep on the ground
How can you think you better than the homeless women or men, when you’re a lost job away from the condition they’re in?
So in your mind, you put ‘em all in the same category
You think they’re all bums and dopeheads, you don’t know their story
Your picture is just a small part, believe it’s bigger
Some lived in big homes with families and made six figures
Served in the armed forces, got college degrees
Others with more knowledge than most people you’ll probably see
But when you look at ‘em, you see people who have no value
Not thinking that one day, the same fate might grab you
The level of misfortune, do you know the extent?
You ever seen three people living in one tent?
The smell of urine in the wind, it’s a sad display
And people laying there everyday wasting away ‘cause they got

No roof, no walls, no rooms, no halls
Hope you understanding the message I’m tryna show y’all, it's
No roof, no walls, no rooms, no halls
Hope you understanding the message I’m tryna show y’all
Tell me why
People always pass me by (every single day, every single night)
’til we die
They see us and they still deny (C'mon, yeah)

The city ain’t doin’ nothin’, they won’t take onus
Money used for everything except helping the homeless
New stadiums, buildings, it’s road construction
But the number living outside there’s no reduction
Some of ‘em have mental sicknesses and health conditions
City officials be trippin’, they won’t help, but listen
Hard to be self-sufficient and get on track
When you lose your way and nobody will help you get back
God bless you if you walkin’ down that long street
I salute the ones who been there and got back on feet
It’s kinda crazy when I see ‘em in a group or alone
Some of ‘em be in better spirits than people with homes
If you never saw it as humbling you gotta believe me
People with real struggles make you see your problems are easy
Next time you see ‘em, look at ‘em and feel their pain
And you should be ashamed if after that you still complain ‘cause they got

No roof, no walls, no rooms, no halls
Hope you understanding the message I’m tryna show y’all, it's
No roof, no walls, no rooms, no halls
Hope you understanding the message I’m tryna show y’all
Tell me why
People always pass me by (every single day, every single night)

They see us and they still deny (C'mon, yeah)",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-walls-lyrics
Anotha Rhyme,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"You wanna see me, pull your cash out
The world don’t wanna see me lash out
OD those sleeping pills, still ripped after I passed out
You optically see what a perfect verbal model be
I’m like a drug now so pharmacies wanna bottle me
If K-Rino spit it, admit it, trick, it’s gotta be wicked
I list rappers names and scratch ‘em off like lottery tickets
I’m the real wizard that Dorothy and them wanted to see
My brain temperature at birth was 203
They say I’m deeper now, that’s how strong my game got
I’m so far out there that I’m right back in the same spot
Figured it out while I dropped a stigmatism
I got a rhyme for every existed microscopic organism
I can take what y’all bringing at me
I ain’t crazy, I’m ducking ‘cause the ghost of rappers I killed was swinging at me
See my vocal cords can stop a train
I strain and pop a vein, trust me, I can drown you with a drop of rain

Here I go, I’m ‘bout to spit another rhyme
Or add flow from another time
The whole universe is in my mind
Sixteen murders in every line
Here I go, I’m ‘bout to spit another rhyme
Or add flow from another time
The whole universe is in my mind
Sixteen murders in every line

If you ever read my resume
You’ll see I’m capable of switching tomorrow out with yesterday
Your lack of skill made me crack the 
When it comes to winning, we couldn’t count on you if you was a calculator
I got dark thoughts so my mind is black
Stared at the beat for three minutes, when they played it back, my rhyme was on the track
I see the platinum pieces you collected
But fool, I’ll hook a chain up to the earth and wear a planet around my neck
Mama said never let a fool beat ya
I’m a cool preacher, you couldn’t test me if you was my school teacher
Concocting ten flows that pollute minds like putting toxin in
My touch is strong enough to leave fingerprints on oxygen
What’s the approximate number of blocks I hit?
Like Glocks, I spit buckshot, toxic shit I got a box of it
I took his life with intellectual karate
Dumped him in three feet of water and they still couldn’t find his body

Here I go, I’m ‘bout to spit another rhyme
Or add flow from another time
The whole universe is in my mind
Sixteen murders in every line
Here I go, I’m ‘bout to spit another rhyme
Or add flow from another time
The whole universe is in my mind
Sixteen murders in every line

I’ll release a rough sounding note
Tell the truth when you hear me rapping, feels like it’s a hand around your throat
The way I kill rappers is beautiful
Scare you so bad that you won’t even show up to your own funeral
Thoughts of me losing are outlandish
I wasn’t born, a artist drew me, when he finished, I walked up off the canvas
I shoot chemicals into your main vein
You could sit next to me on a flight and still wouldn’t be on the same plane
Forget the body, man, I gots to shoot hands
I make haters spread more often than a prostitute’s legs
My vocabulary burns skin and kills your nerves
Beat you with my rap book to make sure that you feel my words
I make the simple things in life seem confusing
They found out my flow was the supplement Barry Bonds was using
In this last line I’m ‘bout to spit, that’s what did it
Matter fact, the line is so cold, I ain’t gon’ even much spit it

Here I go, I’m ‘bout to spit another rhyme
Or add flow from another time
The whole universe is in my mind
Sixteen murders in every line
Here I go, I’m ‘bout to spit another rhyme

Don’t Know Nothin’,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"All she had was one son, the hood is where they come from
By the age of 14 his life became undone
Yeah he knew his real dad but he did him real bad
Never did a thing for him ever so he still mad
Longing for his true roots, putting on some new boots
Just a year ago he was on comic books and Fruit Loops
She scared of her own son, calling but he won't come
No longer her baby anymore, this cat is on one
Turn into a little goon, got to deal with him soon
Mamma coming home from work, thugs in the living room
Acting like an older G, he out of control indeed
Can't believe he was sitting on her couch rolling weed
She could smell it all on him, had to call the laws on him
Tears in her eyes, told him you take him 'cause I don't want him
Because of how wild he been, it's a wrap, dial him in
Two nights in the county, now he crying like a child again

You was all about your grips, sports so you ain't got to trip
Top student in the school about to get a scholarship
The one they love to bring up, respectful and clean cut
Never seen a teen more focused on his dream, but
Now you wanna leave school, now you wanna be cool
Peaking out the window, fascinated with them street dudes
A good chance you wasting one, tryna be what they become
You got the potential to make millions, but you chasing crumbs
Had you from the word go, all up in that world bro
Getting a little money but you worried 'bout them girls though
Education cancelled, I don't understand you
Fell in love with one the whole neighborhood done ran though
Caught her with another cat, hated to discover that
Ran up on him with a loaded gat and laid the brother flat
That's the picture he'd paint, you in love, she ain't
Moving on with her life, but he in jail so he can't

Let me teach you

Be a leader, just be a leader
Them stupid fools you following around don't see it either
See you ain't got to sell on dope, fight or do no stealing
If you not feeling what they 'bout to do just say I'm chilling
The punishment for victimizing folks is fast coming
Don't ever let nobody turn you to a crash dummy
You not the first thought or the last man, I saw too many
The ones you running with today won't be around at 20
Or maybe 25, some are lucky to see 30
And if they see it, it's because they locked up, hope you heard me
So now the choice is yours to be intelligent and worldly
Don't be foolish and think you got it figured out this early
You might not know that it's a plan and brothers are in danger
Don't mess over yourself, slow it done, channel that anger
'Cause one bad decision can destroy you when you're done
See the key to getting old is being smarter when you're young

Year Just Pass,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008,"Yeah
Look at you mayne
Still on that same thang you was on back in the days mayne
I about to beleive in them lies no more mayne
You need to go get up and do something for yourself

We like to blame the word when really we tie our own nusions
Spend ninety-five percent of the time making excuses
Everything you ever did was at a slow rate of speed
It's always somebody else's fault you didn't succeed
Carry out the same slow patterns for years in a row
If the coach ain't hate on me I could of went pro
You hate to see somebody being what'cha wish you could be
You on the coach criticizing them while lay on TV
Understand that what a gift from God we all was blessed
But best believe that talent alone don't promise success
Success comes when you ain't scared to act on a thought
The formula for winning is skill plus hustle plus heart
Your partition was never seed you stuck on freeze
Making no cheese because procrastination is a disease
What kind of man goin put his own destiny in his hand?
Instead you waiting for somebody else to give you a chance

As the years just pass
Yeah, week after week, month after month
You just sit around on yo ass
Huh, while everybody else is out there on the hunt
Homeboy you need to change yo ways
Man, stop roaching off folks and get'cha own
Still going through the same old phase
Seem like every other day you need a loan

Everything you own in life is in a dirty little pouch
Almost 30 years old and living on yo mama's couch
You better man up quick you too old to be bratty
Feeling bad about your life because you never knew your daddy
If your parents wasn't there to raise you through the situation
Don't use that as a crutch, use it as a motivation
Making something of they-self is what real soldiers do
So forgive em and try to do better than they was with you
See you been saying you goin get a job and come up with the quickness
You been saying you goin learn a trade and start your own business
You been saying you goin finish school for real and quit bluffing
Five years that went by you still saying but doing nothing
With your lack of confidence you make your own restrictions
Ain't nobody is like perfect we all walk in contradictions
And you couldn't of been came up and got you some shine
If you focus on getting yours and stop tripping on mine


When you look into the mirror homie what do you see
I paid my dues in life now they starting to pay me
Had my times to keep my mouth, my times I talked
I done balled, I done struggled, I done rolled, I done routed
Came up and fell off, I been happy, I been lonely
I done ate good for years I done starved and went hungry
I done took and I done earn, got lucky and got burned
I done pull stunts and had stunts pulled on me and return
If you got kids and still have a change for your past
You need to take your belt off and let them whoop yo ass
Cuase they young and can't comprehend what you all about
But when they old enough to understand they'll call you out
See you ain't never been a brother, not to mention a friend
You not even been a has-been cause you never been to begin
When a person like you falls I'm never surprised
A two dollar ass fool telling million dollar lies",https://genius.com/K-rino-year-just-pass-lyrics
Deth Season,The Other Side (Mixtape),2008,"Spit bars, get larger than life and get robbed
It's all about the Benjamins the ballers tip-off
Tip off of the old block
Jackers be lurking, keep your doors locked
More cops more jail, more prisoners no bail
Catch hell if you go tell
Family with you? Oh, well
No telling what niggers might do to you over dope sales
More hell in a hand basket
Death to prevail drastic
Funeral homes overcrowded the try to sell caskets
I pass and fail classes, I rap to tell bastards
Not to excel backwards
Snapp is a well grafted architect
Mellow dramatics gats you with sharper flex
Thoughts affect you in ways you can't imagine, you call it stress
It's all a test, we gotta make it pass these obstacles
Survival of the fittest, not all about what you got to prove
If I was you, I would at least listen to reason
This is the season for niggers to die, at least you still breathing

Capitalism widespread
Hospitals supply dead bodies for organ donations nigga, you heard what I said
Prison making them top dollars
Free labor, we not outta slavery yet, niggers still wanna flash and pop collars
And you ain't got to be a top scholar
That's obvious poverty-stricken hoods, ghettos niggers should even probably guess
If I was you, I would at least listen to reason
This is the season for niggers to die, at least you still breathing

Situations make my dome stress
My inner good and evil won't mesh
I'm a victim of my spirit, incarcerated in my own flesh
I'm high from wisdom, I made a wise incision
And ignorance was extracted like cataracts from eyes for vision
We fought to make sure each degree was taught
And cure diseased hearts and encourage whole nations to see with thought
Pitiful conditions once we decipher the riddled in
It's easy to win and devils get cut-off like middle men
Your deviation stunning elevation the punishment is outright alleviation
Death has no abbreviation, the rush it contains is the incredible of veins
And left carcasses drained in unedible skeletal remains
Knowledge I'm growin' that
When I ejaculate you throw it back
In fact it's like my brain was covered up with a prophylac
So minds are barren
And wise women and men are staring and glaring
Through ignorant people as if they were transparent

I murder all conformists
You can have a million followers
But if ignorance rules their mind states then they're harmless
The storm I form is calmless
Mental extremities so equipped that I can bear-hug you armless
Even in silence I speak just as loud
And expound vocals in crowds that will make their ancestors proud
We're disconnected like a unpaid phone bill
Now we abnorm, It's sad to see people die before they're born",https://genius.com/K-rino-deth-season-lyrics
Good Cop,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"Right about now man
We’re gonna show appreciation man
To the law enforcement, that’s true to their job man
All y’all ain’t bad, and we know that

I wanna recognize the good cops out on the beat
Who do they jobs the right way when patrolling the streets
We all know what the dirty cops are passionate to do
But it ain’t cool to blame the whole for the actions of a few
Big props to the ones who decide to be real
They ain’t riding around looking for somebody to kill
Out here working with the public, not causing the suffering
Not profiling and pulling people over for nothing
They don’t judge based on the side of town you’re from
When they show up they talk to you respectful and calm
The principals of the job, they carry them out fully
They ain’t joined the police force to scheme and be bullies
Several of them are my homeboys and some of them ladies
I got a lot of cop friend and ain’t none of them shady
They be working hard daily giving people they' all
Protecting folks for real, we appreciate y’all

Yeah, hey
We showing love to the cool cops (cool cops)
Nothing dirty on their minds when they cruise blocks
Trying to make the city better cause it’s too hot
Doing it the right way we giving you props (giving you props)
We hope the problems in the hood stop (please stop)
So we shouting out to good cops
Nothing dirty on their minds when they cruise blocks
Doing it the right way we giving you props

Every cop ain’t out to hurt and disrespect your pride
You were speeding that time and they let you slide
He ain’t mad at you 'cause you riding around on dubs
Much love to the cool ones that be at the club
And all the dedicated officers who puttin' in work
Trying to clean up the city, not add to the dirt
To the ones who secure us and give us support
And only use force as a true last resort
Some of the officers I met had me deeply impressed
So the transgression of some don’t speak for the rest
Don’t pull out the negative shoes as if they all fit them
I had hung out, cracked jokes and played ball with them
Any types of dispute get correctly addressed
Good cops listen to both sides before they arrest
Treating people right, they ain’t on that arrogant trash
And they don’t think they better than you cause they’re wearing a badge

Yeah, hey
We showing love to the cool cops (cool cops)
Nothing dirty on their minds when they cruise blocks
Trying to make the city better cause it’s too hot

We hope the problems in the hood stop (please stop)
So we shouting out to good cops
Nothing dirty on their minds when they cruise blocks
Doing it the right way we giving you props

Peace to the police who don’t break the rules
Who be helping the community and speaking at schools
Really honest and dedicated is the way I describe them
They don’t mind meeting with people to fix our problems
And they’re not trying to provoke you they’re not harassing
Just because they got guns they don’t jump out blasting
Black, white, Hispanic they ain’t about that madness
If you got a question for them they don’t mind you asking
When they show up on the scene they not looking to bleed you
If they gotta arrest you, they follow proper procedure
They honestly joined up to serve and protect
The key to better relations is the word respect
It’s a lot of honest officers that’s there for you
Who get overlooked because of what the bad ones do
If you calling them out too, I’ll salute you today
Keep being a good example and leading the way

Yeah, hey

Best She Could,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"Baby daddy didn't step to the plate
What you going through daily I can never relate
Super women to the third power it's so deep
Child crying all night, didn't get no sleep
Still had to go to work I respect ya completely
Multiple multi-task and you made it look easy
God is with you he'll prove it in time
How you juggle all of that without losing your mind?
Kept it together all by yourself mostly
Light bills, phone bills, rent and groceries
Thank God for you praise the lord
Had a little boy and still learned to raise him hard
A few fellas came and tried to get with ya
But they ain't want the whole package so they out of the picture
Had game but he couldn't deceive her
If a man don't want both then he can't have either
Yea
You don't have to hang your head
No help so you handled everything instead (one deep)
Single momma did the best she could
And in the end, it turned out just as good
(Listen to me now)
You don't have to hang your head
No help so you handled everything instead
(You and God)
Single momma did the best she could
And in the end, it turned out just as good
You said you learned a valuable lesson
Choosing him was a mistake but your child is a blessing
The circumstances wasn't all that cool
At first you used to hunt him down and call that fool
Saw that chump with a diamond watch life is a trip, but he won't even give you no bread for diapers and milk
In the 2 years your daughter been alive he showed you
The sorry dude dun probably dropped a hundred bucks total
Crazy, you would think that he would care
Good thing that your momma and your daddy was there
And what makes the whole thing so bad he go hard for the child him and his new girl had
Huh, that's like a slap in the face, now the other side of parent hood you have to replace
And when the child gets older the realitys sad, that you might have to here him ask the question where's my daddy? But
You don't have to hang your head

Single momma did the best she could
And in the end, it turned out just as good

You don't have to hang your head
No help so you handled everything instead
(You and God)
Single momma did the best she could
And in the end, it turned out just as good
Yeah it's true this world broke our families up
But the real truth is men ain't being man enough
Where the dudes at? It's so strange
More females than males at the little leage games
You never came around, dude that's cold
It's ashame that she had to assume that role
And even though she felt low and used
She probably wore both hats with no excuses
The way she get down you gotta respect it
Never seen her child lookin hood-out and neglected
Mistakes is made, but to judge who are we?
One is hard enough, imagine having two or three or four or five, weak cats get scared of y'all
But you made it cause God close sheltered and fed em all
Don't ever look at yourself and think somethings wrong
Keep believing and the right one will come along
You don't have to hang your head
No help so you handled everything instead (one deep)
Single momma did the best she could
And in the end, it turned out just as good

I Stay Workin’,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"I stay workin'
I stay workin’
I stay workin'

Through the frustration and tears, pushin' with no fears
Phone still ringin’ after all these years
You want it free, don't call my number, call his
But if you're talkin' ‘bout spendin' paper, I'm all ears
I told ya, it's only one, the rest is imitations
K done raised up at least two generations
My plate is full stacked up, unlimited work
I'm asking for seconds and I ain’t even finished my first
I be on the floor while you’re watching me from the bleachers
People tryna reach us, seeking concerts and features
Breadwinnin', went from not having to penny to plenty
I’m working harder now than I did back in my twenties

I stay workin'
We grinders, it ain't hard to find us
I stay workin'
We grinders, it ain’t hard to find us

Life is hard but it's harder when you stupid out here broke and don't wanna do shit
Work come before success
Grindin' come before shinin'
People gotta walk ‘fore they start ridin'
Nah, I ain't money hungry
Point Blank out here providin' for the family, in these streets collidin'
I'm talkin' ‘bove ground, that mean the ground ain't on me, nigga, that's OG official
Authentic since day one, been scrappin'
And I ain't one of these bitch ass niggas, they be slappin'
Nah, I don't hang and I don't kick it
Soon as some shit pop off, you got a room full of crickets
No money, no reason
I like my meat well done, no salt, light on the seasoning

At close range, shootin', producin' head-knockers, it go bang
We believe in gettin' that change before 
Let loose them thangs, robbin' the dark night then back to the cave, Bruce Wayne
I stay work and I'm lurkin', at your front door or the back entrance
See that  like a twenty year flat sentence
No punchin' out, I gotta eat
Crunchin' for them numbers, 
 know I'm paid like money in the bank
Either way, a nigga withdraw interest
Out all night, up early with the goons and gorillas
Now where's the stash at? Rockets blasting behind them hidden figures
Never tired, we take off after feeding, no ‘migos, just killers
And you gon' know it from the fist clique, SPC, WK, nigga

Look Inside Yourself,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"This that part of the game where we look inside ourself to see if we who we say we are

You can’t say that you got faith and then go backwards
Faith only gets strong when put into practice
When it’s hard, I can see your foundation shifting
If what you say and what you do shouldn’t be no different
And don’t be yelling, “God is good” when things is going well
Then don’t even wanna pray when you going through Hell
Everybody gets tested with trials and pain
Now you feeling all betrayed when your turn came
Never did think the creator would test you
Why not? Oh, my bad, I forgot, you special
And now you get to see what most people knew
If the prophets had to suffer, homie we do too
If you got trust in Him, he’ll see you through
But when I look at how you act, I don’t believe you do
See as long as you standing upright below the Sun
It ain’t nothing that you don’t have the power to overcome

Don’t say you a believer if you don’t mean it
You are or you’re not, ain’t no in-between and
It’s sad when people fall off and I done seen it
Matters how bad the situation, he’ll redeem it

How many times did it seem like you wouldn’t gon’ make it?
How many people attacked your spirit to break it?
How many times was your situation in question
Then out of the blue, God hit you up with a blessing?
You was doubting the whole time, negative instinct
Can’t base the Most High off the way we think
Our thoughts are usually of the primitive kind
But He thinks far beyond our limited minds
All that fairy tale teaching, we burning that trash up
Can’t pray then lay, gotta get your ass up
No time for trifling kind sitting around whining
‘Cause God only helps those who don’t mind grinding
You sitting in the house fronting like you believe
Waiting on a lick that you didn’t work to receive
When it get bad you gon’ be the first one to leave
When you lose hope in Him it’s gon’ hurt you to breathe

Don’t say you a believer if you don’t mean it
You are or you’re not, ain’t no in-between and
It’s sad when people fall off and I done seen it
Matters how bad the situation, he’ll redeem it

Things might get tight, might not go right
If you ain’t got no fight, then you ain’t got no life
Plans won’t work out no matter who you follow
‘cause if you got doubt, you getting chewed and swallowed
Family member in the hospital going to war
But you believing in the doctor’s words more than the law
You singing them church songs like you are in the spirit
But when it got real, man, you wasn’t tryna hear it
I ain’t mad though, long as you keeping the faith
‘cause the opposite of prove what you speaking is fake
Ignored your first mind ‘cause you don’t understand
So you try to take crucial matters into your own hands
Now your whole routine don’t make no sense
You got BS thought in and God coming out the bench
Your lies are standing strong but the rest of you falling
Then soon as you get jammed up, guess who you calling?

Don’t say you a believer if you don’t mean it
You are or you’re not, ain’t no in-between and
It’s sad when people fall off and I done seen it
Matters how bad the situation, he’ll redeem it",https://genius.com/K-rino-look-inside-yourself-lyrics
Life Story,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"Let me give you a little bit of
Insight
To the road your boy had to travel so far

Whoa, it all started on a Wednesday
Labor pains, hospital room then K
My grandmother named me, I was with it then
They wrapped me up and brought me home to the dead end
We growed up with love, neighborhood was fast, man
Mama made sure her son always had things
Daddy was a hustler, he did it all his life
Playing pool, poker, making bets and shooting dice
He didn’t live with us but he wasn’t far from me
First time in my life seeing large money
Kept my pockets full, fifty bucks was great then
Chillin’ in the pool hall at the age of ten
By now we in the village, I’m a overachiever
I played a little ball, coulda been a wide receiver
Life was pretty good, and every day was new
But things took a bad turn in 1982

This is just a few parts of my life story
I know I did a few things that wasn’t right for me
This is just a few parts of my life story
I know I did a few things that wasn’t right for me, I’m still learning though

I lost my grandmother, mama’s married, now it’s on
You know the drill, me and step-daddy don’t get along
Felt like a third wheel, too young to understand
Trippin’ ‘cause I’m the only child but that’s my mama’s man
But then he went to jail, pain she tried to keep it in
By then we living on Salinsky, two deep again
I met some new friends, and day and night we ran
Around eighth grade is when my rap life began
Boys would battle rap, I never heard of that
Went home and wrote a few, came back and murdered cats
Figured I must be good, wanted to prove it though
My daddy broke some bread and threw us in the studio
I’m seventeen now, first rap record made
Travelin’ and talkin’ major deals in the eleventh grade
A few mistakes were made, I went from group to group
A few years later still never seen no loot

This is just a few parts of my life story
I know I did a few things that wasn’t right for me
This is just a few parts of my life story
I know I did a few things that wasn’t right for me, I’m still learning though

I’m outta school now, still at my mama’s house
A grown man now, stepfather finally out
Music was in my blood, to them a wasted scene
They said go get a job, I’m tryna chase a dream
Although I love ‘em both, I knew I had to go
I asked my dad, “Can we try again?” He said, “Fa sho”
This time we movin’ units
So now we making chips
I’m living life rapping, struggling with relationships
Around that same time, I dropped another bomb
I visited The Nation, converted to Islam
The truth was uncovered, they snatched the tablecloth
My content changed, started scaring labels off
Went through some ups and downs, no longer concerned with fame
The hard road I traveled just helped me learn the game
And this is just a short passage to capture my life
Parts of my past but I still got some chapters to write

This is just a few parts of my life story
I know I did a few things that wasn’t right for me
This is just a few parts of my life story
I know I did a few things that wasn’t right for me, I’m still learning though",https://genius.com/K-rino-life-story-lyrics
Million Dollar Slave,Mind Vision,2019.0,"This is how the game is played, no matter how much you got, watch it

When you started out you was hard then master gave you the nod
Folks worshipped you like a god but that was just a facade
You gave the system a try so now your status is high
But your position  so how you act and comply
You came up out of the field, hoping to properly build
He showed a lot of the skill
His hustle got him a deal
But shortly after you knew this game was ratchet and cruel which made you actually lose the happiness you pursued
They peppered you with the praise, big revenue everyday
Yet telling you what to say whenever you hit the stage
When something pop in the streets, they take your option to speak
Don’t want you dropping no heat, they even watchin’ your Tweets
So if a topic arise, they pimp these popular guys
Make statements that’s not advised, they make you apologize
They keep it low,  knew they wanted to hurl
They show you their power by punking you in front of the world, you’s a

Million dollar slave, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You’s a million dollar slave, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You feelin’ comfortable ‘cause now you got the mansions and cars
You get to be at the award shows and dance with the stars
They see you fighting for a cause, now they sick of your ass
So they pickle your past instantly and dig up some trash
They’ll hold some old dirt until you force ‘em to use it
The machine builder can tear it down whenever he chooses
You were not produced to speak truth or that’s just how he views it
‘cause the use of his platforms are only for his amusement
Ain’t no protestin’ and speakin’ out, that’s not how he raised you
The price for being a good slave is the millions he pays you
Caught up in the depths of a false sense of acceptance
Never using the devil’s history as a reference
Two hundred, three hundred million, it don’t matter your worth
Soon as you think you flyin’, he gon’ slam you back to the earth
Tear you down in the media then watch the hate ensue
They’ll even make your own community turn against you, you's a

Million dollar slave, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You’s a million dollar slave, yeah, yeah, yeah

Question:
At the peak of success, can you still keep your respect?
I’ve seen ‘em put some of the biggest black people in check
You spent years signing contracts, cashing in royalties
But soon as they jam you up, you spendin’ that on lawyer fees
Or they see the people rising up with boots on the ground
So they put you on Fox News to calm the broke slaves down
You start defending everything master say or he do
But after all that sellin’ out, they cut your ass loose too
What else is new? Same formula, they constantly do it
The corporate world, sports, politics, movies and music
Your loyalty, they make you prove it on a tv show
(*Authority figure*: Do you support Minister Louis Farrakhan?)
(*Intimidated subject*: Um… no?)
’til we break free and establish our own, ain’t much coming
Knew that every dollar they ever paid you was hush money
After seeing this for years and years, by now you should know
You only get to go as high as they allow you to go ‘cause you a

Seven-thirty P.M. I'm G-ing
I turned on the TV to watch the NBA on ESPN
Got a call from KO AKA AB
He said K let's go eat at the OG ASAP
I said OK, hand me some cookies was goin eat them (ha)
My bread was kinda low so I went to the ATM
Seen my homie D and my young potna C Slim
Standing on OST arguing with his BM
I said AYE! Look out for HPD and told them be blessed
And I GO cause I ain't had time for the BS
On the way he saw my boy Lee
Gave him a CD and a ten because he told me that his tank was on E
He used to be a athlete at PV
Transferred to FSU and the STC then he shattered his knee
The MD said no NFL
Because the MRI reviled that he tore his ACL
He use to crease it had to DCB
Got torment SOB, DA send him a TVC
I shot him twenty more dollars on GP
Then I told him to stay in touch he told me that's a BET
C'mon
Yeah

Ha-ha, HA
That's one example
Lemme give you some more game
Watch this

This is not the OC, the trouble last longer than double OT
Your gonna leave a SOS just to leave, be on your P's

Try'na get from point A to point B
It's no love whether you got a GED or a PHD
The FBI try'na make us see jail
That's why we bring our A game and keep on hustling on the DL
Ghetto CEO's live in HD
It's in our DNA to grind and keep on connecting like AT&T
We'll punch an MF in the nose
When ya messing with pros it's best that you know your X's and O's
RIP to the USA
We leave haters DOA and LOL at the KKK
I SMH and holler OMG
The hood is contradictory like a AAV and that's BYOB
Pushing more drugs than CVS
Find them on MLK in the BMW OD from popping Ex

Breaking cats in these streets, that how my name rose
No pretty shirts, I hurt and murk the game in plain clothes
I’m plugged in, let me come and get my spit on
You a buddy pass rapper, you just waiting, hoping to get on
Y'all careers go flat faster than hot soda
Blow up in September, all over by October
These fellas still confused, I’m ‘bout to kill the ruse
Try to be real, you lose, fakeness got ten million views
The world don’t know you weak, allow me to reveal the news
Your name I will remove, a baby’s feet can fill your shoes
My words are like a drug, can’t take ‘em all at once
Might overdose, I gotta start you with two bars a month
The only place I follow you is to the cash spot
So pass the rock ‘cause I ain’t scared to take that last shot

I’m somewhere else with it
I’m somewhere else with it
I got this thing all figured out, you need some help with it

I wonder if I oughta break him, I’ve been contemplating it
They said that you was overrated, that’s a understatement
I’m smelling something fishy
You gotta stunt to make it
You can’t compare a couple of decades with one month of greatness
Peace to Trayvon, I’m more than just a little mad
I’m walkin’ home with a grenade inside my Skittles bag
Boom boom on yo ass, that’s my theme song
Came out the womb with a championship ring on
I’m not the average man, I came to rule the land
I would smack this fool but I ain’t tryna bruise my hand
I might get mad and pimp the game just to prove I can
In my hood they unload and load just like a moving van
I see ya actin’ like Goldy with ya fake Roley
I’m so underground that underground cats don’t even know me
I get your girlfriend’s number, think a brother lyin’?
I just need one digit, I’m so cold I guess the other nine

And I don’t give a snake dap, that’s why I left ya hanging
You make me feel postal, that’s why my skill broke you
I’m laying real vocals, guess that’s why I’m still local
You need to give back every dollar that your fans paid
You ain’t a made man, your whole image was man-made
I see ‘em plotting hard, I know they probably fraud

You not the best, all your yes men lied to you
My accidents work out better than the stuff you try to do

I’m somewhere else with it
I’m somewhere else with it
I got this thing all figured out, you need some help with it
You couldn’t pack the load
I snatched it up and left with it
They thought I brought a army, just me and myself did it
I’m somewhere else with it
I’m somewhere else with it
I got this thing all figured out, you need some help with it
Stop me I think not
Y’all know this flame hot
We got the game locked
You still in the same spot

South Park Coalition
The SPC still on it
Y’all boys too ordinary
Doin’ the same things you been doing ten, fifteen years ago
Come join me in a other world
Leave the planet for a change
Quit tryna be like everybody else
Yeah, we ain't like y’all no way",https://genius.com/K-rino-somewhere-else-lyrics
We Ain’t Forgot,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"Yeah
I know how you feel man you feel like you by yourself in the world
All the struggle you been through
And what I notice, you ain't alone, check it out
Listen

The one's that's in the county, the one's that's in the pen
The one's who passed away who we won't ever see again
Women and men who sleep beneath the underpass through all seasons
The innocent victims of the streets who died for no reason
The newborns who in the middle of the night just stopped breathing
The child whose father gave him no warning before leaving
The momma whose child was killed years later still grieving
Who had faith but circumstances made her stop believing
You got molested when you was young they raped you and they hit you
You never told nobody you grown now and that pain is still with you
The sister who was struggling with daily financial issues
As long as we got breath in our lungs we can't forget you

Don't think that we forgot about you
We pray for you every night hoping God'll pull you through
And even if in this life you don't win
No one understands that we'll be the winners in the end

We still remember your names and your faces
Blacks killed over daily basics murdered by White racists
Who caught unjust cases with mase with tribulation
We appreciates the sacrifices made for liberation
The Freedom Fighters who fought when the devil tried to condition us
The indigenous ascentors sandered politicial prisoners
The ones who took they only life when nobody would listen
The girl who got kidnapped eight months ago and still missing
The one who got shot by the cops with no consequence
Who the news mentioned one time you ain't heard about it since
The man who got railroaded thinking justice would pervail
The young homie who got beat in jail and died inside his cell
The good women who can't find a man even though she need one
Who helped everyone but when she asked for help received none
Who gave all they had till it was nothing left to give
The aborted baby who never even got a chance to live


The unknown brothers and sisters who were burn to ashes
The million of slaves who died in the middle passage
The young soldier who unjustly lost his life
The family who went to sleep without a meal last night
The young dude who finished  because he dropped out of school
The sister who getting beat on every night by a fool
The worker who grinded hard but seem to never get props
Every brother who shared blood from the hands of devil cops
The ones that started real but at the time they just dropped off
The Black sell-outs on the listed gets they heads chopped off
Every set up on the Black man, every government hit
Every person who in time for the crimes they didn't commit
All figured of racial profiling who had the laws do em
Every crooked prodocation who got a slug coming to em
All these slick corrupt devils and the money that they stole
And George Bush for every lie that his dirty ass told! (Yeah)

I wanna send much love and respect to the homie A.C. Chill

Don’t Front A Playa,K-Rino,1998,"Let me drop the game if you find your ass frozen
Don't front the player if your girlfriend chose him
I don’t give a damn if they in the bed posing
Don't front the player, don't front the player

Rule number one, don’t ever pay a crook
That’s page seventeen, paragraph eleven in the player book
It ain’t my fault that you’s a fool from the neck up
Fell in love, went to work, then gave your ho damn check up
Then came home, somebody needs to slap him in the dome
He’s a trick, called her twenty minutes late, she was gone
Straight game with her, found somebody new running that thing in her
Fool, you think she love you ‘cause she bought your ass a wing dinner
Beat down the pimp, check your dirt, initiated
Tried to run up on that brother when your woman violated
Thought you was the man but you a fool when you assumed
She left the club with a player, spent your money on the room

So I’ma drop the game if you find your ass frozen
Don't front the player if your girlfriend chose him
I don’t give a damn if they in the bed posing
Don't front the player, don't front the player
Silly ass suckers fall in love and start dozing
But don't front the player if your girlfriend chose him
I don’t give a damn if they in the bed posing
Don't front the player

These suckers making false claims, with false game
Calling black women out their name with no shame
She left your ass for big paper ‘cause she need support
Ain’t got no job but somehow she’s sporting every brand new pair of Jordan’s
She see you at the door and say, “Who is it?”
Then tell a lie and make you leave so her real man can come and visit
And when he pull up you be pulling out
You pushed back in, stepped to him and get your ass busted in the mouth
You got mad wanted to drop her
But brother, if your woman want the next man, ain’t nothing you can do to stop her
Thought you was real but you’s a fraud
Claiming you got game but your girl won’t even let you use her food stamp card
Getting steel, you tricking plenty
She game with conversation real enough to make you give her change for a penny
And after all the games she throwed at him
She took his ride and seen him standing at the bus stop and blowed at him

Somebody call 991, this boy need to see a doctor
Ain’t never been rolled before, let this bitch get on top of him
Pussy ain’t your unless you got your dick in it
If she gon’ fuck she gon’ fuck, you can’t go air well with it
Don’t be jealous when another nigga tell you he met her
And took her home, you know the deal, the same thing when you met her
So don’t be sick over that bitch and let her take you the full run
Just keep sipping the rum and let her drink the cum
A real player like me, __ that bitch up like a blunt
It’s obvious to see she’s on a dick hunt
She need to be fucking for a fee and not for free
A bloodhound bitch and I don’t need the itch
And you can keep the crabs for yourself, I don’t want no parts of it
Ain’t even gonna speak on it, if you like it I love it
Wrap that up in a Christmas gift and put a bow on it
And if anybody ask you, tell ‘em Point Blank rode it

Best Friend,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"Uh, what a real cool thing
Call her up, what’cha doin’, homie? Let’s hang
Pick me up, I’ll be outside waiting on her
Let’s ride through the hood, let’s bend a few corners
Something on my mind, I can call her on the phone
Two or three hours straight, laughing all night long
She always keeps me in a positive zone
People swearing up and down we got something goin’ on but
It ain’t even like that, fam
She my partner, my best friend, take me how I am
We two of a kind, spend a whole lot of time
She tell me ‘bout her problems, I tell her ‘bout mine
When I say we ain’t smashin’, my boys think I’m lyin’
The crazy thing about it is I ain’t even tryin’
Yeah she pretty and fine, that can never be denied
But the best thing about her is she beautiful inside so

Been around a long time, ain’t never seen nothing like this
(ain’t never seen nothing like this, mane)
All we do is hang out, just talk, don’t cuddle or kiss
She’s my best friend, ooh
He’s my best friend, ooh

A breath of fresh air from the everyday stare
I love our conversations so innocent and rare
I know you a king ‘cause you recognize a queen
You never disrespect  vibrate like a fiend
The movies, the park, the simple little talks
We have our own lives so it’s platonic that we walk
We both are very spiritual, that brings us enlight’ment
Even if we attempt it, we don’t sway from our righteousness
We don’t sway from our righteousness
You have a way of taming my lioness, yeah
I see you taming my lioness
While haters on the outside looking in ain’t buying this
It’s ok as long as we know
If we keep it one hundred together we’ll grow
Treasure moments with you, my best friend
Heaven sent so I know this will never end

Been around a long time, ain’t never seen nothing like this
(ain’t never seen nothing like this, mane)
All we do is hang out, just talk, don’t cuddle or kiss
She’s my best friend, ooh
He’s my best friend, ooh

Me and her ain’t on no mushy stuff
If I like one of her friends, she’ll hook me up
Kinda like a big brother, I be overprotective
Plus I give her good advice from a man’s perspective
We ain’t married but we together for better or worse
(Ay K, you know how…)
Girl, don’t be interruptin’ my verse (whateva)
We can talk crazy to each other, crack some jokes
I even hit her up for cash when my ass is broke
I know a lot of people won’t understand this
And assume since I’m a lady that I’m your mistress
And it’s far from the truth, there’s nothing going on
No sex, just convo, laugh and then we gone
Until the next time, we just might call or text
That’s what best friends do out of mutual respect
We know society is not good on double standards
I can’t help that my best friend is tall, dark and handsome

Been around a long time, ain’t never seen nothing like this
(ain’t never seen nothing like this, mane)
All we do is hang out, just talk, don’t cuddle or kiss
She’s my best friend, ooh
He’s my best friend, ooh",https://genius.com/K-rino-best-friend-lyrics
Same Old Same,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"I done heard at least fifty-five thousand rhymes
Everything been talked about fifty-five thousand times
Every single topic and idea that I hear
Been recycled by rappers for years back into my ears
In my estimation since I been rhyming
‘bout twenty-five thousand emcees that mentioned diamonds
No original messages, still in the cover deficit
I’m guessing it’s probably a million strip club references
Who’s the most gangsta? Who’s slanging the most product?
How many songs about all the people that you done shot up?
The streets, they run the birds and how good he flips ‘em
Infinite depictions of they vehicle descriptions
It’s only so many freaks, only so many parties
Every artist in the world done claimed they hood’s the hardest
Every concept that’s ever been written I’ma listen
Three thousand four hundred twenty-nine baby-mama disses

It’s only so many times to talk about balling and turning up
The women that you pimping and all the trees you burning up
Lying about being on top when they ain’t hot
All the rappers that’s bragging about money that they ain’t got
What they do to snitches if you catch ‘em after they tell
You wrecked the sales, or how many times you been to jail
All the things that you can do, clothes clean and brand new
How you a damn fool, how many women you ran through
Only so many times we wanna hear that same talk
How you the main boss of the game, how much your chain cost
Ten thousand records about the trap house that’s not hidden
It’s only so many times to rap about how high you gettin’
How many bottles you poppin’, how much coke you sniffin’
Every female rapper talk about they got dudes trickin’
How these other girls is jealous, yeah you got the right to spit it
But every rapper spittin’ the same subject though, aight we did it

(What about me?…)

It’s only so many times we wanna hear you speak about
Your rhyme techniques and punchlines on different beats
How mentally deep you are, every album you manage to
Constantly talk about how no rapper can handle you
It’s understandable but dammit dude, it’s gettin’ scary
Everybody ain’t tryna hear you quotin’ the dictionary
Won’t you bring it down to earth? Come up with a different phrase
I done heard you use the same type of bars ten different ways
You gon’ brag on your wordplay, you gon’ do some tongue twisting
You gon’ probably start every verse off by saying, “Listen!”
And throughout the course of your whole career, we been endorsin’ ya
But it’s only so many songs you can make about the Sorcerer
To talk down just ‘cause you don’t do it, that ain’t expansion
You throwing stones from the rooftop of your glass mansion
Don’t hate on other rappers for speaking on what they love
‘cause you do the same thing, every artist alive does

Let It Be Known,The Other Side (Mixtape),2008,"Let it be known I'm a dangerous fella
I decapitate rappers like a helicopter propeller
Like a Mafia killer unstoppable topics I sever
Drop a lyrical obstacle in cold or tropical weather
Yo, my flows carry me to places unthought of
I go to sleep inside my room but I wake up underwater
Started ripping, boys thought that I was fiending, they tripping
I was sipping lyrical liquid from a different dimension
I'm on the couch 'bout to run in your spouse
Fuck with me you might just wake up with a son in your house
Understand it I'm heated, I'm heated, I'm heated, I'm heated
I'm heated, the shit is so true I just got to repeat it, feel it
You wanna get high, I got what you need
I invented smokeable alcohol and drinkable weed
Oh yeah, sometimes I go where the savages go
I'll jack an average Joe if my cabbage is low, it's K-Rino
Fuck jail, I ain't doing no time
A twenty-year sentence to me is just a long-ass rhyme
I speak to wild animals and flip my demeanour
HaHaHa,
 that means ""fuck you"" in Hyena
Hey, I hurt ‘em with a paragraph I exposed
Killed my ex-wife for tryna take half of my flows
I’m what happens when shit talking and drama collide
We can battle at your house and let your momma decide
I got pride, I play to win, woman or man
I’d rather beat ya for free than lose to you for fifty grand
You wanna roll with K-Rino, I’m telling ya never
I wouldn’t let you kick it with me if we played soccer together
People speaking on my verses, they don’t know me, in fact
Me and these whack rappers get along like Kobe and Shaq
I spit derogatory statements till I made ‘em react
Catch his ass slipping with four killers and fade ‘em to black
The greatest rap prose, I suppose I’m bound to get chose
Bound to spit flows and execute you counterfeit hoes
It shows, you write your rhymes with a feminine touch
I got a steroided rhinoceros adrenaline rush
You can’t explain cerebral range from a heavenly plane
I can never be trained, my head contains seventy brains
They hear me shooting these lines, nobody responds
I’ll make these punk rappers walk more times than bonds",https://genius.com/K-rino-let-it-be-known-lyrics
Hand Cuffin’,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"Stop handcuffing
Stop handcuffing
Fool, you’ve been talking thirty minutes but not saying nothing
Stop handcuffing
Stop handcuffing
Fool, you’ve been talking ‘bout a hour but not saying nothing

Have y’all ever seen a dude with his gal at the mall
And he settin’ screens for her like they playing basketball?
You be tryna check her out but dude, he all in your dome
If you ain’t want nobody looking, you shoulda left her at home
Plus she wearing that little miniskirt in a public place
And her ass was smiling at me twice as hard as her face
Turned your back for a second, she still managed to beat ya
She got approached by two young playas, a dike and a preacher
Man, y’all know the main type of situation I love
Is when I see a fool with his woman holding hands at the club
I let it slide if it’s a nice club with class and no guns
But why the hell would you bring your girlfriend to ’s?
C’mon dude, think about it, man, you asking for trouble
Somebody slipped a number to her and y’all got in a scuffle
Got your ass whooped behind her, she still got out of line
She was back in there the next week but by herself this time

See I like Polo with the logo, stretched across my chest
And a bitch upon my dick and sucking the creases out of my Guess
And she gon’ suck me out of my stress
And she gon’ fuck me out of my mess
And she gon’ bring me all of my change back on a plane
In exchange for nothing less than some brains and a shot of sex
I feel like taking my fat ass dick and fucking the shit up out of her neck
Working a bitch out of her check if her trick got a connect
Hoe, you better be having what’s mine by the time I come to collect
You better respect unless your trifling ass is ready to undress
You acting like you ain’t a hoe, if so, I’m not impressed
This shit is real in the field and if you’ve never seen a meal
Then you sloppy and without me, bitch, you probably never will
It’s ill when you feel like I feel ‘bout a nothing-ass hoe that I be fucking and you be handcuffing still
My bitches hit they hustle when it’s time to pay my bill
I’m a pimp and you a simp and all that other shit can chill

Stop handcuffing
Stop handcuffing
Fool, you’ve been talking thirty minutes but not saying nothing
Stop handcuffing
Stop handcuffing
Fool, you’ve been talking ‘bout a hour but not saying nothing

Patna, when you was riding the bus, we put that bitch in a Honda
And you’s the type of nigga if you got rich, you’d put that bitch in a Hummer
I met her through a homie that fucked her who was introduced to her by his homie that fucked her at the Martin Luther King bus stop
Klondike Kat, use that hoe, pimp that hoe, she give me some licks
Went back home, sucked your dick, put you to sleep, she’s a  bitch
I can’t believe some of the shit she tells your ass over the phone
How your bitch gon’ explain them three weeks that she ain’t been home?
You supposed to mash that hoe, trash that hoe, set up a licks then take that cash
You like that hoe, wanna wife that hoe
She know that so she takes you fast
You think she’s sweet so you call her a peach
But she’s got fifteen different niggas’ nuts smeared on her seats
But that’s what you get when you fall in love and handcuff these scandalous witches

I amaze these niggas, I take these high class hoes and get my pay
Vice grip your hoe but you still can’t keep Klondike Kat’s game away

I knew she was a hoe when I met her, had to get her, yeah
I woulda fucked if she ain’t had that bitch ass nigga with her
Walking around, holding her hand like he a babysitter
But he gon’ lose that bitch today if he ain’t handling his business
Next time he see her, she’ll be kicking her heels off
In a road runner  walking up and down Hillcroft
Only time you see me with her when she breaking the bills off
Or you might catch her a little after 3 at ’s parking lot
Nigga really didn’t know he was sitting on a gold mine
It hits my big pimping but tricking the whole time
Paying rent, car notes and shit, doing hair
Help take care another nigga kids that’s supposed to be playa
Bitch keep her legs in the air and I keep her on the strip
Instead of giving that pussy away for rides and shit
Why the hell you gon’ fuck the whole block for free
When you can charge the motherfuckers and give the money to me?

Stop handcuffing
Stop handcuffing
Fool, you’ve been talking thirty minutes but not saying nothing
Stop handcuffing
Stop handcuffing

I really would appreciate that if you just listened to it
Oh, I'm sorry
My bad

DJ DJ hey what's up?
I brought you a copy of my brand new cut
I'm just a young artist tryna mash and grind
Can you put me in the mix so I can get me some shine
""Don't you see I'm real busy and I'm pressed for time
Just leave it on my desk and if I get some time
Then it's possible I could play it down the line
Or it could be tomorrow if you give me the sign""
A sign? ""Yeah fool a dollar sign
Ten to twenty thousand would suit me fine
Just leave me a number, no you can't have mine
If you serious I'll hit you up tomorrow at nine""
Man I just got through telling you I got no ends
If I had that kind of bread I wouldn't need your spins
Now I see how the game go it's all about mail
Let me get out this building before I end up in jail

I go, DJ DJ what's the deal?
It's looking like I might have to bust my steel
Shouldn't have got fly with me when I gave you my song
Now I've got to bring the bloodshed straight to your dome
Come on, DJ DJ what's the word?
I'm really not feeling no songs I heard
I'm in this rap game pushing tryna hit me some licks
What a player gotta do to get thrown in the mix

I walked in the club with my new CD
Work mode I ain't tripping, no who see me
Got my single in the pocket of my warm-up pants
Cause I'm knowing it could blow up if they give me a chance
I said DJ DJ how you been?
I'm just a young rap cat tryna win
You don't even have to play it when the club is live
It can be the last song at 1:55
He said, ""Look, let me tell you what you need to do
You get the radio to play it and I'll play it too""
I said, Nah man, what you saying can't be true
The dude at the radio station sent me to you
And anyway if you a real jock, break the song
Just play it, if it's trash then I'll leave you alone
But if the people start jamming to it show me some love
Before we drag your hating ass out of this club, c'mon

DJ DJ what's the deal?
It's looking like I might have to bust my steel
Shouldn't have got fly with me when I gave you my song

DJ DJ, wow what's this?
I tried to be professional but now I'm pissed
I really really wish you would have told the truth
Now there's twenty five goons in the DJ booth
Now you wanna talk and negotiate
If you a real DJ then you supposed to break
Being arrogant and stuck up was your mistake
When they approach you, you just turn your nose up and hate
Put my song on right now, don't start a hope
Cause ain't nobody gonna help you, you can call the Pope
Matter fact, play 'Rich Girl' by Hall & Oates
If you ain't got it, we gonna stomp you in front of all these folks
DJ's and club radios spinning these tracks
With a Synergy Mac and sucking up to industry cats
Politics and fake DJs, you know it's deceit
Payola ain't cheap, the real radio is the streets

Come on, DJ DJ what's the deal?
It's looking like I might have to bust my steel
Shouldn't have got fly with me when I gave you my song
Now I've got to bring the bloodshed straight to your dome
Tell 'em, DJ DJ what's the word?

I'm in this rap game pushing tryna hit me some licks
What a player gotta do to get thrown in the mix

Aye, we sendin' out a world wide decree to the streets
It's time to start snatchin' these DJs by they bra straps
All these fake frauds, 
Wanna be disc jocks around the world
That ain't showin' love to the streets

Trying to Find the Words, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"I was in the sto’ chillin’ not feelin’ no pressure
Paying bills at the courtesy booth inside for yester
And there she was, whoa, I hope my eyes don’t undress her
The line was so thick I had time to assess her
We had something in common off the top, I think brokeness
‘cause both of us was holding a overdue pink notice
To get this girl’s attention at this moment seems hopeless
Then I zeroed in on her with sharp and supreme focus like zoom
Process and yeah that’s a winner
And as I got closer, that’s when I saw something in her
Couldn’t look directly at her so I tried to see through her
And now it’s eating at me, I just had to speak to her
Should I smile, should I wave, should I ask her for the time?
Should I say what’s on my mind or just come up with a line?
She’s a few people behind me so I’m tryna keep my grip
And these old folks’ll kick my ass if I let her skip so

Oh my, what am I to do?
I’m contemplating when to make my move
Layin’ low, tryna keep my cool
I’m tryna find the words to say to you
Should I just go and let her know?
Should I just leave and let her go?
But ah man, she’s so beautiful
I wanna speak but I’m nervous though

I can’t take it no mo’, what I’m witnessing is glaring
Did my best to turn away but I couldn’t stop staring
I couldn’t hold my tongue and just watch her walk away
And let somebody else tell her what I know I oughta say
So I built my nerve up, in my mind I started asking
What do I have to lose, what’s the worse that could happen?
If she cappin’ I might try to play it off and start laughing
Or just go on ‘bout my business if she click and start snapping
But passing on this moment might weigh heavy on my conscience
I’ma count to three then I’ma walk up on her, man, I promise
A small waist plus a perfect face, I’m astonished
Had to tell her what was in my head, I had to be honest
The closer I got to her, the nervousness exposed
All natural like I like it plus she pretty as a rose
Counted to three, stepped right up to her, here it goes
I said, “Excuse me, beautiful, you got a booger in your nose”

Oh my, what am I to do?
I’m contemplating when to make my move
Layin’ low, tryna keep my cool
I’m tryna find the words to say to you
Should I just go and let her know?
Should I just leave and let her go?
But ah man, she’s so beautiful
I wanna speak but I’m nervous though
I’m contemplating when to make my move
I’m tryna find the words to say to you
Should I just go on and let her know

Let her go

Forty-8 Lashes,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"Yeah, just bought a brand new whip
So everybody in this room that don’t wanna get they ass tore off
I would advise you to leave right now
Every now and then we gotta make an example
So once again

I’m like the letter ‘a’ in the word drama so comprehend it
‘cause I stay in the middle of it and I always end it
I’m the sergeant, I bust and lightening-bolt my target
I would call ya trash but I don’t wanna insult my garbage
See I knew your style would be weak before you said a word
So I covered my ears to make it the worse flow I never heard
The notion of K-Rino not winning big is absurd
In a contest with three people, you couldn’t even finish third
There’s no other, I’m the microphone-in-your-jugular shover
I’m so sick you get the flu just by touching my album cover
With the swing of only one hand, you’ll see ten jabs
My voice vibrates in the cracks in cement slabs
K-Rino, my black book is my soulmate
I’ll grab Texas by the panhandle and spank you with the whole state
I never sidestep, I roll straight
My opponents hate ‘cause I get up in they grill like Colgate uh

Whip ‘em with forty-eight lashes
Cremate you with nuclear heat flashes
Then roll up your ashes
I’m still the same killer that I was last century
Run for ninety years but I’ll murder you eventually
Whip ‘em with forty-eight lashes
Cremate you with nuclear heat flashes
Then roll up your ashes
I’m still the same killer that I was last century
Run for ninety years but I’ll murder you eventually

I’m the phantom of the new opera
The true mobster that’ll booyaka a cop in a lot with two rastas
I strip marrow from bone in a bionic zone
I’m like the Incredible Hulk on human growth hormone
I speak monsoons every time I record tunes
You a paper cut, my lyrics are samurai sword wounds
Mi casa is su casa, come into mi casa
Where I lock ya in a basement and shock demons about ya
Real heat reveal
My third degree burning higher skill kill seven rappers at the fire drill
Ain’t no way for a weak Peter Pan emcee to stand
Like a dike in a pair of Dickies, you just wish you was the man
The most reliable brand, justifiable homicide hand
Verbal elements of the most maniacal strand
You clone this, you become prone to get your dome split
I need my parent’s permission to listen to my own sh*t

Whip ‘em with forty-eight lashes
Cremate you with nuclear heat flashes
Then roll up your ashes
I’m still the same killer that I was last century
Run for ninety years but I’ll murder you eventually
Whip ‘em with forty-eight lashes
Cremate you with nuclear heat flashes
Then roll up your ashes
I’m still the same killer that I was last century
Run for ninety years but I’ll murder you eventually

I stick you from ridiculous range, my curriculum strange
Like a person staring at a picture-less frame
You’ll never fathom what my words’ll do to your health
No man is wise enough to teach me so I tutor myself
Triple the sun and volcanic lava, my blast is hotter
The linguistic mass marauder, Massacre University is my alma mater
Crazier, ain’t nothing saving ya
Hot as a fool wearing a fur blazer in the summer in Saudia Arabia
I squeeze a round after I beat him down
Next time you see this clown, he’ll be in a drag queen lounge in a evening gown
Believe it or not, South Park’s the lyric-killing spot
Where bullets go in your ass just like a penicillin shot
I grab your skin and (*mouth sound*) like velcro
Playing with me is worse than getting blindsided by an escaped gorilla elbow
Rolled my words in paper weed, light ‘em and standby
It’s so potent before it hits your mouth, it gets your hand high

Whip ‘em with forty-eight lashes
Cremate you with nuclear heat flashes
Then roll up your ashes
I’m still the same killer that I was last century
Run for ninety years but I’ll murder you eventually
Whip ‘em with forty-eight lashes
Cremate you with nuclear heat flashes
Then roll up your ashes
I’m still the same killer that I was last century
Run for ninety years but I’ll murder you eventually

Conversation With God,Guest Appearances Part 4 (Compilation),2007,"Yeah, between me and you, personal conversation, don’t nobody know me like you do, let’s get real for a minute, listen

Once again I come to you with tears in my eyes
A mixture of hate and lies it took years to devise
You knew I’d do it before I done it so you wasn’t surprised
You read my mind as I justified and rationalized
Constantly kept committing sins I knew you despised
When you ignore the voice of God inside, a part of you dies
I don’t wanna be chastised and meet my demise
Like the guys who neglected to follow the path of the wise
I’m the one to whom your holy scripture applies
And with studying application, I can spiritually rise
If we meet you halfway, man, I know you’ll oblige
And show mercy on a sinner as long as he tries
I know you’re everywhere, even though I look to the skies
You’re also within, so I gotta self-analyze
So I can possibly avoid being the one victimized
By the evil actions that my inner demons comprise
I feel the day that you cast me out and break all ties
For chasing women and material things money buys
I don’t wanna be a devil in a righteous disguise
Even at my lowest point, you still answer my cries
When I get weak, your words make me feel energized
And fear no man, despite his social status or size
You never left my side, kept me through the lows and the highs
So I’ma strive ’til both our wills become synchronized

In this world, so many things are going on
It’s been going on
Ah so long
And I’m so tired
And I don’t know what to do
So can I talk to you?
Can I pray to you?
Can I conversate with you?

My neighborhood’s a mess, I must confess
I’ve been walking a thin line but knowing you I’m blessed
It’s disturbing seeing babies raising babies
Mothers raising their kids in clubs instead of 
And for the , boys smoke and carry guns
Disrespecting elders, now what’s really going on?
Crime is higher than the oil 

God, why it seem that people dying quick?
AC died,  killed, both at the age of 36
And my high school prom queen, 
The smartest guy in class,  moving bricks
The government is still getting rich
Poor getting poorer, reminding one third our world is sick
The hurricane  are still catching hell
Separate from the family with nothing but a story to tell
So I’d rather conversate with you, Lord
To answer my prayers and this is true, God
The game of strength when the fam came uneven
So I continue to help others until I stop breathing
There’s so many people in them corners
Using and bruising helping hands, give me a sign to the fronters
Running  before the world ends
And cleanse my soul of all my devious sins

In this world, so many things are going on
It’s been going on
Ah so long
And I’m so tired
And I don’t know what to do
So can I talk to you?
Can I pray to you?
Can I conversate with you?

Too much killing
I can’t take no more
I’m ready to walk out the door
Can somebody, anybody
Hear the things that I’m saying?
I’m down on my knees
That I’m praying, praying oh
Can I see you?
Can I pray to?
Will someone help me get right?
Moving on, I’m moving on
I got to go
I got to go
Goodbye",https://genius.com/K-rino-conversation-with-god-lyrics
Politricks,Time Traveler,2006,"Our ancestors saw the future, they fought and they bled
Ni**as these days can’t even see five minutes ahead
Most our people either ignorant, ass backwards or scared
Ain’t got no bread or broke because nobody broke bread
I’m seeing red, ay Bush, why don’t you change your attack?
And send your drunk ass daughters overseas to Iraq
We snatching all our people back, and when we get through
Colin Powell and Condoleeza will be listening to Screw, yeah
I’ll never let these snakes rope me in
Black folks watching the war, talkin’ ‘bout “I hope we win”
Who the hell is ‘we’? The US your enemy too
And when they finish over there, fool, they’ll be coming for you
Now roundup all the sellouts, sucka Toms and tricks
We snatching preachers out the pulpit in 2006
And anybody tryna stop K from doing my duty
I’ma leave your head flatter than a white girl’s booty, uh

We ain’t scared of your politricks

Death of a politician, 2006

White man, I can’t believe how bold you stand
You call the Mexicans illegal when you stole they land
Coulda helped us in New Orleans but too evil to try
You blew the levees up and left the black people to die
On death row, you executing while you stand saluting
Y’all murdered Stanley Williams and Frances Newton
I’m waiting inside the storm for the rapture to come
If Bin Laden blew up the buildings, why’d they capture Saddam?
Put us in poverty to spark crime and make laws feel us
Lock us up for selling something y’all invented to kill us
Jail is legalized slavery, I’m speaking the fact
And the highest percent of prison population is black
Now prisons on the stock market ‘cause it’s a industry
Killed a black mind, replaced it with white supremacy
To them you still a ni**a slave, dumb and embarrassing
But as soon as they start a war, we all Americans, nah

We ain’t scared of your politricks
We see your crooked ass politics
You want the real, come follow this

Death of a politician, 2006

Woke up from my rest and got out of bed
Put sandals on my feet, wrap a turban ‘round my head
Most high son so I live like a god do
Dope-E the name, got guns, iron rods too
Government gets away with disgusting crimes
I’m all about higher learning like Busta Rhymes
And Ice Cube, terrorist, ain’t a nice dude
You’ve grown to hate me, white boy, but I’m never like you
Bomb threats scaring you with harassing mail
Blow the catholic church up with 
Eight trillion dollar deficit, what about taxes? Every time I ask this
Mr. President won’t return my phone call or faxes
Sit around waiting on crackers, freedom never rings
My life done had more blues than BB King
South Park Coalition, we conditioned
Plus in position on top of a roof, death of a politician

We ain’t scared of your politricks
We see your crooked ass politics

Speak of the Devil,No Mercy,1999.0,"Yeah, I'm on the first bus to Jasper
I've got some unfinished business to settle off with Casper
Getting them good, we will, man of sin revealed
Murderer from the beginning, the countless number he killed
6,000 years of murder, lies and bragging
Genesis, a serpent by revelation of dragon
White philosophers stealing from the Egyptians
Devilish actions match a man now who fit the descriptions
Unrighteousness played with precision
Tamper with scriptures, then brainwashed the ignorant with his religion
Ooh, knowing the Mack D would come from the East
Babylon under judgement, US government  god increase
Calamities multiplying the misery
Devil attempting murder, no mercy, study this history
Master come, send messenger after grafted one
One man needed for job of resurrection, he drafted one
To bring the truth about the enemy that's scaring ya
Knowing that CIA stands for Crack In America

Lie teller, truth faker, born killer, the mind breaker, Devil",https://genius.com/K-rino-speak-of-the-devil-lyrics
Another One,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"See they got another one
Say, at what point are we gonna come to grips with the fact that we are targets out here, man?

Another victim of the racist police department
No gun, no weapon, this beast is heartless
You the peacekeeper, blacks on the streets is cautious
‘cause we knowin’ that they never wanted peace to start with
Nothing said, he spoke with his gun instead
Mama got a phone call, “Ma’am, your son is dead”
The officers know the truth, but they won’t admit it
Investigation conducted by the ones who did it
Listen, the facts don’t lie so your words I’m squashing
Those in denial say it’s media’s concoction
Protesting is a option but really why bother?
Another son or daughter done lost they father
They never reveal why the officers will lie
We give it a real try, comply, you still died
Know why? ‘cause he wanna reenact the hurt
No charge, let it blow over and back to work
Back to work, still livin’ that life, while a son or a daughter’s never comin' back home, and the family gotta deal with that

It’s the
Same old song
Another one is gone, gone, gone
Family left alone-lone-lone
Another one is gone, gone, gone

Cops killed Gregory Hill, the result that follows
Civil suit judge gave his family four dollars
Three for his children, one for funeral expense
Then they came back and changed that to just four cents
You see these folks don’t care ‘bout a black man’s life
You just a thug and a animal in that man’s sights
Kill him while his baby in the back seat of the car
Man, that’s raw, boy, you talk about leaving a scar
What child should see a parent get shot down flat
They could live to be 90 and wouldn’t get over that
Nightmares of those incidents stalking their sleep
And the person who murdered daddy still walkin’ the street
All that talkin’ is cheap ‘cause the system’s horrid
See, a lot of these killings don’t get recorded
Victor White committed suicide is what they attest
Handcuffed behind his back but shot his self in the chest, c’mon
See we keep makin’ mistake of thinkin’ that this system is gonna work for us when history has always shown us the opposite, man, yeah

It’s the
Same old song
Another one is gone, gone, gone
Family left alone-lone-lone
Another one is gone, gone, gone

How can they say they didn’t do it when the camera proved it
They concluded that all black people are stupid
Evidence obvious and they still don’t use it
Criminal case against police, the victims lose it
Whole lot of brothers got beat down or shot
What about the scared cops who stand around and watch?
Knew it was wrong when they put his brains all on the pavement
And you know it didn’t happen how they said in the statement
When you blast on America’s innate racism
Those with ‘em accuse you of creatin’ division
They jackin’ up our young children, doin’ ‘em dirty
Pullin’ guns on ‘em just to strike fear in ‘em early
The victim less eternal, they murdered and beat him
We know the names already, we don’t have to repeat ‘em
But the sad truth is with these wicked minds
There’s an innocent one right now that’s next in line
Sad but true, see, even when the camera show they did it, they still get acquitted, hell, they can even admit it, yo

It’s the
Same old song
Another one is gone, gone, gone
Family left alone-lone-lone
Another one is gone, gone, gone",https://genius.com/K-rino-another-one-lyrics
Then and Now,Then And Now (The 4-Piece #2),2019,"Man, I be thinkin' sometimes back when we was young, all the things we had, we thought it was like the coolest stuff, man, then times passes on and new technology brings in new stuff, it’s all good, man, let me tell ya how we did it though

I listened to long play and wax records back when I was little
Them 45s where you put that round piece in the middle
Collecting football cards from anywhere I could find them
8-tracks playing straight through ‘cause you couldn't rewind them
Catchin' whoopings with that switch, yeah, that might be me
‘member when grandma used to have that black and white tv?
A clothes hanger was the antennae, no, this ain’t a joke
We used to sit it on top of the big tv that was broke
Rotary phones, man, I ain't seen one of those in a while
Seems like the number used to take us five minutes to dial
You'd be like *brrrrrrrrrrrrrrr*, man, I wish I could show ya
And you'd be hot when you mess it up and have to start over
Gettin' poked by the loose springs comin' out of your mattress
Wearing' them tough skinned jeans with them thick knee patches
Plastic covering that good couch, better not sit there
And hot combs got the house smelling like burnt hair so yeah

Years pass and the planet keep spinnin' ‘round
A lot’s changed when I think about then and now
I love the past and the present and I mean it y’all
I'm glad I’ve been here long enough to where I've seen it all
Years pass and the planet keep spinnin' ‘round
A lot's changed when I think about then and now
I love the past and the present and I mean it y’all
I'm glad I've been here long enough to where I've seen it all

Before the world was like it is now, some of us remember
Summer days, no air condition, box fan in the window
If you was driving and your beeper started beepin' like that
You pulled over to use the payphone to call people back
Wasn't no GPS system through your cell connection
If you was lost, you had to stop and ask folks for directions
Hung your drawers on that clothesline without no thought
And back then we used to know people's phone number by heart
And if a song came on the air and you ain't purchased it yet
You could tape it off the radio, straight to cassette
After school, everybody at that arcade, man
Twenty quarters lined up on that Pac Man game
And schoolteachers could paddle you with pieces of wood
And if you had an Atari, man, you was big in the hood
Good Times and Fred Sanford, man, that sh— still funny
And food stamps used to come in books like real money so

Years pass and the planet keep spinnin' ‘round
A lot's changed when I think about then and now
I love the past and the present and I mean it y'all
I'm glad I've been here long enough to where I've seen it all
Years pass and the planet keep spinnin' ‘round
A lot's changed when I think about then and now
I love the past and the present and I mean it y'all
I'm glad I've been here long enough to where I've seen it all

If you at the mall, lookin' for a new girlfriend
Wasn't no lockin' numbers in, you better have you a pen
No computer for the DJ, just beats full of bass
It was actual turntables, they was reachin' in crates
Encyclopedias was Google searches in those days
If I had internet way back then, I'da made straight A's
VCRs to DVRs, having cable was rare
The hood looked out for the hood, people actually cared
Your homie had a busted up car, you'd straight ride in it
And if you did do some dope, you didn't take pride in it
A lot of things change over generations, it's wild
We was scared of our parents, now parents scared of the child
Even the hoop game is not the same as when I was little
What used to be a carry then is now a regular dribble
Evolution good or bad, I understand that trend because I'm not even the same person I was back then so

Years pass and the planet keep spinnin' ‘round
A lot's changed when I think about then and now
I love the past and the present and I mean it y'all
I'm glad I've been here long enough to where I've seen it all
Years pass and the planet keep spinnin' ‘round

Signz of Hate,Fear No Evil,2014.0,"Signs of hate, look for the ones that be watching your funds
They'll eventually lead to your clique and your cock and your guns
You know the type of cat that's always finding fault in your game
The one that's always tryna  in your name
Sabotaging your every move with scientific precision
Catch their eyes turn your flesh with your peripheral vison
Stay on the low 'cause I'm a threat that go from cool to illegal
Why would a fool you never met before be mad when he see you?
The broke one that's always talking down on a player that's rich
Scared of jail before he do a week the bastard will snitch
They spend half of his shit that hits at a disasterous pitch
Venomous passages inject poison and damage a clique
I insist on swinging my fist and leaving them pissed
Breaking bones inside your body that don't even exist
Whether you know me or you don't keep all that plex on the shelf
They spend more time hating on you than loving theyself, for sure

These are the signs of hate
People knocking every move that you tryna make
Always  but you know every line is fake
I push 'em off because I ain't got the time to waste
Murder I contemplate",https://genius.com/K-rino-signz-of-hate-lyrics
Tap Out,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"The  uncursable king to being versatile
Test me and get your title took like something personal
Kill ya three times, into the future I run
So the DVD of part three will drop before part one
My style complex, everything you trying to be
You couldn’t figure it out if I gave you the ‘i’ and the ’t’
I broke in your thought bank and deleted it
See my words are like minutes
Neither’s the same as the one that preceded it
If this appearance started speculation of my involvement
Each body part went to his wife in monthly installments
To try to speak my bars is insubordinate
Your tongue will dissolve like it was dropped in a toxic flammable solvent
Attack your consciousness and enthrall it
Scholars said explaining me is like a phone with no number, they can’t call it
All in all, I brawl with maximal gall
Lyrical shadowboxer who sprawled and left cracks in the wall

I make ‘em tap out
Have ‘em so mad that they wanna pull a strap out
I make ‘em tap out
Have you so mad you gon’ wanna pull a strap out

If I beat you in ’99, the level etched in your mind
I’m ten times better now
So if you reach it, you still ten levels behind
I harpoon the invisible symbol that marks you
My  so far away that the light was dark too
When you see the hovercraft, know that I’m at the helm
My thoughts stem from a source that exists beyond the mortal realm
In actuality, you’ll never reach the science in me
Until you learn how to reciprocate the sky and the sea
At the loftiest peak is where my imperial seat be
My feet be so high the universe is underneath me
You can’t beat me so you surrender completely
I sweep through galaxies barely speaking 
They should exhume my tomb in 3099
And place my rhymes in their own Smithsonian-like shrine
Call me to the square, I promise you through
A child you ain’t even conceive yet got a better chance of living than you

I make ‘em tap out
Have ‘em so mad that they wanna pull a strap out
I make ‘em tap out
Have you so mad you gon’ wanna pull a strap out

Let’s fast forward to the day I’m supposed to face your rhyme
I’ll bring a camcorder in case you think I’m spaced and blind
Feel me wrecking you entirely, won’t erase a line
Come back and show you that you lost so you won’t waste your time
My head space is a fertile intellectual oasis
Recreational planet to planted high speed chases
I walk acres of an infinite matrix in eight paces
I shift earth plates with my most basic rap statements
You in the mental basement, lackadaisical and complacent
While the thought rates of the ancient greats and mine lay adjacent
So many inimical verbal homicide cases
That me and the coroner are on a first name basis
Cranium overload, too many thoughts for your one brain
It don’t fit like seven cars parked side to side in one lane
Over you I floated with stealth
You couldn’t make the story end with you winning if you wrote it yourself

I make ‘em tap out
Have ‘em so mad that they wanna pull a strap out
I make ‘em tap out
Have you so mad you gon’ wanna pull a strap out",https://genius.com/K-rino-tap-out-lyrics
Sensitive Male,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"Ow! This next song is dedicated to all you jive turkeys
Sittin' on the toilet with your panties 'round your ankles
We call this one ""Sensitive Male""
My, my, my, my
What do we have here?
'nother one of these weak little punk ass ni**a dudes runnin' 'round here
I dedicate this to the sensitive male, let's go

Sensitive male, how come you so sad?
When things don't go your way, you get mad
Got the look of a dude, but you soft like a lady
Thirty-two, whining like a spoiled little baby
You’re weak in the mind, every minute it shows
Your heart got broke, now you say all women are h*es
Your boys went to hang out, you was shocked and stunned
And you was ‘bout to cry ‘cause they didn’t ask you to come
See people ain’t tryna vibe with that negative flow
Plus every time y’all get somewhere, you ready to go
You stay pouting and whining, bro, that’s all you do
Your girlfriend got a son, now it’s like she got two
Words hurt your feelings, you can’t handle what’s said
Grown ass man can’t even scramble a egg
I detected that you was flaky, I knew it when I saw you
I’m a dude, homie, why you gettin’ upset ‘cause I ain’t call you?

Sensitive male, sensitive guy
Actin’ like a sissy but I don’t know why
Anytime I see you, I just walk on by
I really wanna slap you, but you might cry
Sensitive male, sensitive guy
Actin’ like a sissy but I don’t know why
Anytime I see you, I just walk on by
I really wanna kick ya ass, but you might cry

Sensitive male need to go and put a slip on
You whine about things grown men shouldn’t trip on
I be laughing when you approach the scene
Quit the basketball team because the coach was mean
You don’t run your own house, it’s apparent to see
I guess your woman wear the pants while you wear the capris
These rapper ain’t no better, they be losing it fast
You was crushed ‘cause somebody said your music was trash
When you got problems with your wife, you start flippin’ and then
Called your mama, cryin’, talkin’ ‘bout “she trippin’ again
Mama, she don’t respect me, I don’t think that that’s right
Is it ok if I come and stay with you for the night?”
But mama got a life, she don’t need you up in the place
She said no and hung the damn phone up in his face
You don’t work and you don’t hit no licks
You the type to take your ball home if you don’t get picked, c’mon

Sensitive male, sensitive guy
Actin’ like a sissy but I don’t know why
Anytime I see you, I just walk on by
I really wanna slap you, but you might cry
Sensitive male, sensitive guy
Actin’ like a sissy but I don’t know why
Anytime I see you, I just walk on by
I really wanna kick ya ass, but you might cry

Ay, sensitive male, man, you softer than satin
Pissed off at your son ‘cause he beat you in Madden
You like the bride and your wife is the groom
Threw the controller on the ground and stormed out of the room
If you don’t get your way, you bail out fast
Gon’ on, ain’t nobody ‘bout to kiss yo ass
That’s why the real Gs left you alone
Insecure so you sneakin’ through your girlfriend’s phone
Say what you want, I’m just keepin’ it hood
See as long as a fool don’t touch me, I’m good
Anytime that a problem arose
Real men iron it out like wrinkled up clothes
Somebody ‘bout to leave you leakin’
You mad at your boy, talkin’ about “we’re not speakin’”
Keep bleedin’ out your ass when somebody hurt you
You gon’ be the first man to do a tampon commercial

Sensitive male, sensitive guy
Actin’ like a sissy but I don’t know why
Anytime I see you, I just walk on by
I really wanna slap you, but you might cry
Sensitive male, sensitive guy
Actin’ like a sissy but I don’t know why
Anytime I see you, I just walk on by
I really wanna kick ya ass, but you might cry, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-sensitive-male-lyrics
When I Eat,Wizard’s Ransom (The Big Seven #4),2016.0,"When I eat, my whole family eat
Peace to my partners that was with me when I ran the streets
Ain’t nothin’ easy in this jungle, understand it’s deep
Nothing is promised so you can’t take it for granted, chief
C’mon, hey

Never had a problem, showing love with what I got
See I ain’t never went without but never had a lot
In my life, I knew to stack, learned one undisputed fact
That if I had it once and lost it, I can get it back
I think about the days when my money barely lasted
When I couldn’t buy a damn three dollar chicken basket
And my homies, they was all up in the same boat
Thank God I never had to slang dope
Down with me, what’s mine is yours
Always ready when it’s time for war
Disrespect me, I’ma find your door
You gon’ feel more heat than an ironing board
If you ain’t loyal like I’m loyal, I’ma have to watch ya
Man, it ain’t nothing more trifling than a selfish partner

When I eat, my whole family eat
Peace to my partners that was with me when I ran the streets
Ain’t nothin’ easy in this jungle, understand it’s deep
Nothing is promised so you can’t take it for granted, chief
I hope y’all feel me
When I ride, my whole family ride
We coming after what belongs to us, won’t be denied
Where I’m from, paper and power’s highly emphasized
I love my folks so I’ma keep on helping them survive
Feel what I’m saying, see

If I’m your boy, I’m your boy, that means I’m riding with ya
3am you call me stranded, I’ma come and get’cha
When it’s on, I’ma stand up for ya, right or wrong
It’s ten of them and two of us, you ain’t gon’ fight alone
They try to keep us on the outside, we gon’ blast the doors
I got a plate of food and you hungry then half is yours
Or we can grind and go get anything our cash affords
You got the rock, you take the shot and I’ll just crash the boards
Too many people out for self, tryin' to fake the funk
It’s still in the same spot that they was in from jump
Turn my back on y’all—that ain’t the kind of man I am
Never forgot who helped me out when I was in a jam

When I eat, my whole family eat
Peace to my partners that was with me when I ran the streets
Ain’t nothin’ easy in this jungle, understand it’s deep
Nothing is promised so you can’t take it for granted, chief
I hope y’all feel me
When I ride, my whole family ride
We coming after what belongs to us, won’t be denied
Where I’m from, paper and power’s highly emphasized
I love my folks so I’ma keep on helping them survive
Feel what I’m saying, see

You got the kind that hang around you only when you shinin’
Soon as you take a fall and lose it all then you can’t find ‘em
They only in your presence when you doing something large
It’s a difference between your homeboys and a entourage
These be the same ones that you helped and fed a lot
But K-Rino your partner whether you got bread or not
And it’s a shame, only real soldiers have these ways
Who willing to share what’s made? Loyalty is rare these days
He came through for you but you don’t come when he in trouble
You rather sit up on that money while your people struggle
Won’t give a dime to a homeless man, you let him suffer
I got my folks covered, all of us done fed each other

When I eat, my whole family eat
Peace to my partners that was with me when I ran the streets
Ain’t nothin’ easy in this jungle, understand it’s deep
Nothing is promised so you can’t take it for granted, chief
I hope y’all feel me
When I ride, my whole family ride
We coming after what belongs to us, won’t be denied
Where I’m from, paper and power’s highly emphasized
I love my folks so I’ma keep on helping them survive
Feel what I’m saying",https://genius.com/K-rino-when-i-eat-lyrics
Watch Your Mouth,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"Here’s another one for y’all, man
All them big-mouth cats out here, man
Yeah
One, two, three, four
Let me tell ya 'bout ‘em
Always got something to say
Always got something to say
Hey
They always got something to say
Aways got something to say
Ay
You better

Watch your damn mouth
Keep saying what you saying and doing what you been doing
You about to get ran out
What you pursuing gon’ lead to your reputation getting ruined
You better watch your damn mouth
Keep on bumping your lips ‘bout people for no reason
Your luck done ran out
They leave snakes like you leaking, no longer breathing

See, y’all worse than TMZ
If you know a messy person, better leave them be
Throwing salt on your name, hard doing it strong
Got people looking at you like you in the wrong
All they been their whole life is an underachiever
If they can’t have what you got, then you won’t either
They want your car, want your house, man, woman and all
They so envious of you they even want your dog
When they see you doing bad, they swarm like rats
Some people become haters, some born like that
Somebody gon’ separate your head from that hat
Still running his mouth, man, y’all better warn that cat
When the back gets stabbed up, you holding the knife
Talking bad ‘bout a man ‘cause you after his wife
You gossiping like a girl, thinking people are playing
You laughing and giggling now but peep what I’m saying

You better watch your damn mouth
Keep saying what you saying and doing what you been doing
You about to get ran out
What you pursuing gon’ lead to your reputation getting ruined
You better watch your damn mouth
Keep on bumping your lips ‘bout people for no reason
Your luck done ran out
They leave snakes like you leaking, no longer breathing

Slander, lies, gossip, hate
Nothing they say about you is said to your face
Negative words, shady ways
Twenty-four hours, three hundred sixty-five days
Jealous friends, wicked minds
Bringing you down with anything they can find
Don’t matter black or white, red, yellow or brown
Anything they can say to tear another down

You love telling folks business, that’s what you do
What if we started telling everything we knew ‘bout you
All the people you crossed up, the friends you burned
When you keep stunting like that, in the end you learn
Worse case, your hot mouth gon’ get you erased
How much talking can you do with a fist in your face?
You doing them shady things ‘cause you blind to the game
Now you surrounded by ten killers tryna explain
These ladies got it bad too, talking that trash
Just because you a woman, you don’t get no pass
They hiding the truth behind those devilish grins
And talk bad as hell ‘bout so-called friends
Revolving ‘round drama, that’s all you about
Mad at your baby-daddy ‘cause he figured you out
Everybody you come across, you run ‘em away
So right now it’s only one thing I’m coming to say

You better watch your damn mouth
Keep saying what you saying and doing what you been doing
You about to get ran out
What you pursuing gon’ lead to your reputation getting ruined
You better watch your damn mouth
Keep on bumping your lips ‘bout people for no reason
Your luck done ran out
They leave snakes like you leaking, no longer breathing",https://genius.com/K-rino-watch-your-mouth-lyrics
Homicide Story,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Homicides take place left and right
We hear about a different murder like every night
I got a 3am phone call, frightening scared
Somebody on the other line saying Mike was dead
What the hell happened? Mike never shot no slugs
(Somebody ran up in the club did it, popped no love)
Did y’all see who it was?
(Yeah, it was clean as day
What’s so crazy he ain’t even leave the scene, he stayed)
How’d it start?
(Man, dude just walked in the place, stepped to Mike, grabbed him, started talking loud in his face)
Saying what?
(A lot of disrespectful words, it was wrong)
Nobody tried to break it up?
(Nah, they was urging it on
I was shocked thinking somebody was gonna do something
I saw two other dudes come, both of ‘em jumped in
That’s when it got ugly and things got deep
Mike started making noises and got real weak
They was showing no love, they was playing for keeps
The DJ was instigating, he kept switching the beat)
Was he in the club by his self?
(I’d say probably)
Wonder why he at the club and he ain’t know nobody
(I dunno, but it went real bad in the spot
I ain’t lying when I tell you it was sad to watch
It lasted way longer than a couple of minutes
Threw him on the floor, picked him back up and finished
Mike got a bad whoopin’, straight out, they took him)
Where the hell was security?
(They was right there looking
The whole time, I knew it was a setup, G
Everybody in the club was in on it but me
The hit was well timed, it was laid out perfect
The way they did it was smooth, it was like they rehearsed it
Two other killers kept coming with plex
They was arguing over who was gonna punish him next
Man, I wish I woulda been there before he got slid)
I’ma be honest with you, bro, it’s nothing you coulda did
These was murderers, you could tell this wasn’t new
If you’d’ve tried to jump in, they’d’ve merked you too
(Why you think I stood back? I ain’t wanna get got
I ain’t know Mike that good but I saw him a lot
Stayed out of folks’ business and never harassed
But I have seen people step to him in the past
Different places, even when his own business he mindin’
It seems like them type of dudes always find him
I feared that first dude when he opened his mouth
He pushed up on him, then he started choking him out
It was crazy how they did it though, I couldn’t believe it
He would yell certain things and the crowd would repeat it
It was loud, it was heated, he was out and defeated
These people were cheesin’ as if they were proud to receive it
I was relieved when they finally fatally slept him
He dropped hard again but this time they left him
It was wide open, plain view, showed the location
People had their phones out, filming and videotaping
Man, I couldn’t even glance at him after what happened
It was over, they walked right past me laughing
The tall guy had a shirt on, it was chilling in sight
It had the words on it “K-Rino, Killer of Mics”)
Damn, RIP Mike, we gon’ miss ya, man",https://genius.com/K-rino-homicide-story-lyrics
How To Be An M.C.,Three Weeks Later (The 4-Piece #3),2019,"Ya know, a lot of people ask me, they be like, “K, how can I be an emcee, how can I learn to rap?”

This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down
This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down

Aye, first off, let me say before we even start
Ya gotta have love for this art-form in your heart
The money part can’t be most important to y’all
You would still do it if it was no paper involved
It’s a hard hustle, don’t get in it if you're not a soldier
You have to go and study the history of the culture
Every emcee dead or alive who ever wrecked it
If you don’t know how the game began, how can you respect it?
Learn how the styles evolved throughout time
The simple and the complex ways people would rhyme
Different flow patterns, learning where certain words belong
But more importantly the content of each song
Expand your mind if you wanna be around for years
‘cause rappers with short knowledge tend to have short careers
And when a thought appears, cultivate it to the max
Stay motivated, too many artists faded and relaxed

This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down
This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down

Gotta find your identity, second order of biz
Can’t be yourself until you find out who yourself is
Formulate your own ideas, develop and write ‘em
You can listen to other rappers but don’t try to sound like ‘em
The goal is not to imitate what clowns might do
Create your own style, make them wanna sound like you
And even if the artist got skill that’s different and wild
You can learn from that talent without stealing their style
You copying hot rappers in the game, that sucks
What if they style plays out, you gotta change back up
That’s the reason why most careers burn out faster
Originality’s what you should be tryin’ to master
Can’t slack, gotta stay up and grind through the night
Redoing a line time after time ’til it’s right
Never run from the critics ‘cause the great ones don’t
And not being scared to say things that most cats won’t

This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down
This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down

There’s a lot of elements that make your rhyming elite
Delivery, voice projection, plus riding the beat
Everybody likes dope tracks but don’t confuse it
A real rapper can wreck a mic without no music
No gimmicks or marketing, it ain’t about no hype
Hell, a real rapper can get down without no mic
Your words are more important than the image and partying
Having a stage presence and controlling the audience
If you don’t wanna practice, better summon the urge
Try to speak clear as possible, don’t jumble your words
Test your skills anywhere that you can get the display
If you think that everybody gon’ love you, quit today
Never start beef, that’s the way your enemies grow
Speak on real life and learn how the industry goes
I can teach you all of this and yet you still might flop
‘cause truth is this is a gift, you either got it or not

This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down
This is how to be an emcee, please take notes
Tryna keep you from mistakes new cats make most
Whatever coast, continent, country, city or town
If you ain’t true to it, homie, put your pen back down",https://genius.com/K-rino-how-to-be-an-mc-lyrics
Aggression,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"My aggression, it’ll make me punch through a mountain for real
All this pressure and this pain make a killer wanna kill
I’m a product of the Killer Clan
That’s why my energy keep coming like a running
My adrenaline is pumping like a machine
It’s been a long time coming
That’s why I’m hyper like a viper when I strike or beat, I’m bringing heat
I’m spitting venom, and I’m aggressive like a king cobra
I’m KB The Kidnapper, playtime is over

Let me start by saying fuck George W
I hope a grizzly bear sneak in your bedroom and smother you
Bush is the Devil, if you follow him, stop
Shadow of death over America, take all of ‘em out
And all you sellouts, although my right hand’s fast
His lips swole, not from the punch but kissing the white man’s ass
Scared of the police, but quick to murder your brother
Why don’t we buck up to these laws the way we do to each other?

My aggression, it’ll make me bust through the penitentiary wall
And try to free Pharaoh, even though I know him
Outnumbered by the guards, I don’t care
‘Cause we tryna make another street military CD and that means
The guards, the warden, they’ll all have to lay it down
Killer Clan trespassing on federal grounds
With them automatic rounds without making a sound
The government is scared of us, them hoes don’t want no war here

Now when I finished him, the water in his bath was red
He hemorrhaged and bled and fell dead with half a head
I’ll make you dream you felt my wrath and got stabbed and begged
The right half of my head was bald, the left half was dreads
I’m a champion, I possess the pantheon
Of unreachable mind levels that you can’t be on
I’m the crypt keeper, the beef eater, breather of a street sweeper
Reaper changing beefers from shit talkers to deep sleepers

My aggression, it’ll make me start beef in the streets
’til there’s nothing left on my plate to eat
Kick Bush in his motherfucking teeth
Walk in the White House and piss on the First Lady
Then take a shit and wipe my ass on the furniture
I don’t give a damn, I’ll go to war with the government
I’ll be the first nigga in history to kidnap a president
Put his ass in the pot, light the fire till it boil
Bitch stop lying, you took us to war for some oil

I know this bitch in Indiana, his name is Cash
Fuckin’ with the SPC, boy we’ll hide your ass
If you ever come to Houston, motherfucker you’ll know it
How you gon’ try to sell my verse and you ain’t paid me for it?
Making moves like you make it's how fools get shot
You named yourself after something that your hoe-ass ain’t even got
You’ll leave this place with a wrecked face
I’ll send your motherfucking spirit to Hell wearing a neck brace",https://genius.com/K-rino-aggression-lyrics
Watch Him,Alien Baby,2011.0,"HA
Watch him
Watch him
Watch him

Uh, it must be the thing to do
People seem to go to jail after they seen with'chu
Real counterfeiting members of your team of who
Let me distinguish the differences between the two
Drug bust, side million, work for work, no kidney
Everybody got years you the only one binny
Much later resurfaced, replan and renamed
Relocate, reorganize, recycle the game
Police top agents stay involved with the stations
Specializing and infiltration of organizations
By half the cats look out in the game in awhile
The common denominator was your name in a file
He done got up in you click so deeply
You could prickly unaware that he reporting through authorities weekly
Got fooled by the gangsta garments
Shouldn't followed your existence cause that's a undercover informant

You better watch that bwoy!
That dude is an agent
Every move that he ever made included a payment
Star witness for the prosecution making a statement
Got you charge and locked up for waiting arrangement

He came out and left field tryna be down
And don't nobody even know who brought him around
But instead and eventually
You saw a bit-lick potentially and anything you need he got it instantly
Trusting and button faker than two blond blacks
He done took ya too higher places in new contacts
But getting jammed with some work ain't funny
Now you got a line of charges pimped on ya like birthday money
You knew something was shaky but you missed the connection
They had him in Idaho in the witness protection
Showing boys where the money at status and guard
He real cool with the police, all of em know him
You done made money with him now ya starting to trust
On the phone saying things hustlers never discuss
Fast forward to the courtroom facing the judge
Prosecutor laughing at you, you ain't know who he was?


You can research the files of hover
And read through the multiple powers of the FBI's wild maneuvers
From the time the CIA was instituted
They experimented with hypnosis and mental movements
Man prove it
Ordinary folks had the thoughts provoke through a mind process called operation artichoke
And anytime a black movement rose up
Agents sow planet in the circle to make it close up
People we let into the hideout
Defined and conquered us from the inside out
They join up and putting the hours
Thoughts of participating report back to the powers
The silence any noise in you
They'll crash airplanes bust a shot or maybe poison you
Just too carry out a wicked agenda
Now the doodlers stood with'cha at the same cattle put a hole in ya

Better watch him",https://genius.com/K-rino-watch-him-lyrics
No Love,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"Yeah, puttin' the whole city on blast on this one. Ain't no love, ain't no love. Time to hurt some feelings. Feel it

Ain't no love in this city I live
Nothin' but haters in this game, it's all take and no give, listen
Ain't no love in this city I'm from
You hoes wanted controversy now I'm givin' you some

Game is fucked up, time for the city to get took back
Weak rappers are made to look good, good rappers are made to look whack
In H-Town, boys be yellin' they cold
Claimin' skills, signin' bad deals, and sellin' they soul
The real truth is, man Houston we got
Mostly past-prime played-out artists that used to be hot
I'll throw myself in that, you could put my name on the list
But yet and still I murdered every man that came in my midst
I never understood how a artist can drop
A hard first album then every CD after that flop
Stepped in the mainstream, then went Hollywood
Then one shitty album later you was back in the hood
Up in your mama's house, tryin' to salvage your name
But it ain't the same, no more cabbage and fame
Some of you hoes are radio hot, but in skills you not
I'll mob yo ass on the street, fuck the deal that you got
Listen


Now straight up hood hits is all that K-Rino spits
Ain't nothin' changed, I'm still on some fuck-the-radio shit
But what's a trip to me, is how the hell MTV
Can do a Houston show and not mention the SPC
Now all you hatin' hoes, understand my position
It ain't about us bein' seen, it's just the principle, listen
We pioneered the Houston rap landscape in Nine-One
Other than Rap-A-Lot, what clique came before us? Find one
See there's the problem now, you rappers too fame
No respect for history, you hoes just jump in the game
Thinkin' you know it all, but I'll expose it well
Think to yourself, how many Houston rappers rose and fell?
If they done watched the winners, the business couldn't exploit 'em
They could study mistakes others made and avoid 'em
But to my real soldiers, y'all already know
I wanna send love to Chameleon, Face, and Zero
Now club DJs, and ones with radio shows
This the year the SPC start back snatchin' you hoes
Y'all too comfortable, so now I'm grabbin' my mask
I catch you slippin', I'ma disfigure your arrogant ass
And fuck the bootleggers, and if you see one, bust
Burn and sendin' our shit, makin' more paper than us
And mixtape rappers, it's cool to get hot in the streets
But sooner or later, y'all need to use your own damn beats, listen",https://genius.com/K-rino-no-love-lyrics
Do U Really Wanna Go,The Other Side (Mixtape),2008,"Yeah. You standin' in front of me, boy, you really wanna do this? Must be crazy

I told y'all a long time ago
I'm the coldest rhymer, bro
Always tight 'cause I'm a pro
I slam ya just like a domino
Tortured your ass kinda slow
I swing and yell Geronimo
Make you go when you trying to stop
And then stop you when you're trying to go
Twenty years, I've been wrecking states
And I never caught a weapon case
Catch you up in your resting place
And steal your ass like second base
All I spit on are proper flows
I very seldom shop for clothes
Take my foes to Pappadeaux
And after dinner I drop them hoes
Victories I chalk them fast
Wack-ass MCs talkin' trash
Had a stalker but I fell in love
With hustle, now I stalk her ass
Did it all for the fun I guess
In my lifetime, (wanna rest?)
I run up in the crowd in the middle of the show
And beat your ass like I was Ron Artest
Ain't no need for pistol play
My lyrics blowed your chest away
I read your horoscope today
It said ""Damn fool don't mess with K""
Flippin' dough just like Pizza Hut
It's serious when I hit these cuts
You cool with me then I'm cool with you
The rest of y'all can just get these nuts

Do U Really Wanna Go, now?
K-Rino still clickin' on these fake-ass rappers
I murder rappers with my flow, now
I stay ready for these snakes and these hatin' high-cappers

Disrespect me I'll slap ya fast
Throw a jab and crack your mask
If I die right now, I'll bet you five dollars
I probably still could outrap your ass
Not interested in sparing lifes
Wearin' white shirts and a pair of Nikes
Rip through your skin with tearing bites
Eat your colon up like parasites
Leave my foes with a cut-off nose

Some pull out guns when they robbin' folks
I run up on fools then pull out flows
My whole life is a dream to me
'Cause nothin' is what it seems to be
When I die I plan on comin' back
So in my will I'ma leave everything to me
Hypocrites try to divide my wealth
While I'm alive they 
I was so pissed off that the crowd saw two of me
Because I was beside myself
Ultimate gold it could span the globe
Each word I say is a mental probe
I live in  everybody is hard
My church packed pistols up under their robes
K is a heavy-weight, son, you a bantam
I'm known to throw an irrational tantrum
Hand 'em hard words, they'll die when I land 'em
Flash it then say ""fuck the national anthem""
I unibomb your whole front lawn
Stab you with the horn of a unicorn
You a waste of sperm, a waste of life
We should've had your funeral before you was born",https://genius.com/K-rino-do-u-really-wanna-go-lyrics
Fakers Die Young,No Mercy,1999.0,"What's the reason why these hard-ass cappers gettin' hung?
The real keep living but the fakers die young
Watch the big shit dig his grave with his tongue
The real keep living but the fakers die young

Aight class, let me teach you hood lesson number one:
Keep your eyes on your money, when them laws is comin run
Real life, understand hood lesson number two:
Nullify all gun-bumpin' snitches out the crew
Write it down, motherfuckers, hood lesson number three:
Just because you spent a grand, don't mean your woman won't fuck me
Listen up, number four: with your partners let it flow
But by yourself and see your foes before they see you time to go
Where I live you got to strive, hood lesson number five:
Talkin' shit you take a dive, you got game you stay alive
Pay attention, make your list, hood lesson number six:
But if it ain't none of yo business keep yo face up out the mix
Keep it low, what I'm stressin', that's lesson number seven:
Understand we live in hell, 'cause without paper ain't no heaven
Let your mind elevate, ghetto lesson number eight:
Don't be out there tryna cap because that shit gon seal your fate


Look in the clique, the twisted minds with agg faces
Routine to interact with drama on a daily basis
Snitches in the midst of true players like they aces
Fakers plus real Gs equals murder cases
Suckers try to sell it, but legitimate brothers they live to tell it
Half these fools talkin' about ""clientele"" can't even spell it
 made these punks, so don't provoke 'em
Killers agg enough to roll your ashes up and smoke 'em
Programmed for drama, street producing, blood from grudges
Motherfucking dealers selling cocaine to the judges
Count it up for the blast, if we acted right the world might last
But if ""if"" was a bullet, we'd all be shot in the ass
K-Rino be underground 'cause they don't play me on the radio
Legendary flower grabbed the micrphone in '84
Fakers falling off because they ain't got no identity
Trying to be a killer got him blowed off the vicinity
Never had a battle, said you did but see you lied to me
Hit him with that swarm and made him feel like it was five of me
Drivin' me, see how ignorant rappers persist to be
No knowledge of self and don't shit about your history",https://genius.com/K-rino-fakers-die-young-lyrics
Seeing Thru Ya,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"Yeah, tryna stay real
In a world full of fakes
It's a full time job

Once again, gotta watch your close homies and your kin
Hard to tell ‘em apart, it’s like my friends and enemies is twins
Messin’ with some of y’all is a gamble like going raw
Talkin’ to these boys is like talkin’ to the law
Now it could be your main chick, the patna that you stay with
Your baby mama, baby daddy, person that you lay with
Too much drama complicates it, that’s why I keep it basic
And never let these two faced haters inside my matrix
Before it all and after, I’m peepin’ all the factors
Planting knives inside the ground while I was bending over backwards
Plotting’ to block doors, mad ‘cause you got more
Soon as you put them on they feet, they knock you off yours
Warning signs got ignored, shoulda listened to my old man
Gotta learn to play your cards right and never show your whole hand
One day you on some dirty sh*t, the next day ya clean
But I can see what’s inside you like a x-ray machine

‘cause I’m seein’ right through ya, I'm seein’ right through ya
It’s a lot of cats like ya, I met ya before I knew ya
The second that you trust ‘em, I bet ya they try to do ya
Keep on playin’ in these streets and somebody gon’ bring it to ya

They be plottin’ to get what you got before you get it
You say somebody broke into your ride, you know who did it
The same person you was braggin’ to when you first bought it
The same cat that hated on your dream before you thought it
I’m knowing these clowns lame, they wanna hold you down, mane
I see seven pounds of hate in you, I got ultrasound game
And every time you try to spit it, I’ma just let my flames kill it
You can’t cook reality and BS in the same skillet
I’ma toss ya ‘cause playin’ with my paper - that might cost ya
Boys’ll rather pay to get you high than buy a CD off ya
You talkin’ like you bossin’, ain’t nobody scared to cross ya
I’m running through these songs hard as suckas like I was Foster, yeah
You touch the sky, now you done got fly
When you needed me for help, you looked like you was ‘bout to cry
Once I see ‘em I delete ‘em, I kill ‘em, gut ‘em and bleed ‘em
Long handled spoons I don’t need ‘em (Why?) ‘cause I ain’t tryna feed ‘em

‘cause I’m seein’ right through ya, I'm seein’ right through ya

If you call and then I’m not answering, wait, don’t wonder
If I don’t hit you after five times, erase my number
That means I shouldn’ta gave it to you out the gate, it’s too late
I didn’t know but then I found out you was fake so I’m straight
Now before I let ya eat with me, I’ma need to see a fee
Y’all be chasing me around just like a bootleg TMZ
Now you all up on my style, you steal it conveniently
You better practice being you ‘cause it ain’t pretty being me
You run your mouth like air conditions in the heat
When you talk it’s like hustlin’, you put your business in the streets
You start cappin’ out the damn clear blue
You told the same lie so much that’s it’s damn near true
Plus you jammin’ boys up in these streets and cats is out to do ya
You done sent mo’ dudes to prison than a prosecutor
No words for these stuntin’ clowns, I ain’t wrong to say
If you ever call me, I’ma have to throw my phone away

Mess,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"This one gon’ hurt a lot of feelings
‘less you real

Mess
This is a song about mess
Do people really act like this? Yes
Always trippin’ on everybody else, need to worry ‘bout yourself

Seen for wrong people plantin’ seeds in your head
Somebody telling you about what somebody done said
You shoulda just ignored it but you ran with it instead
And that’s the reason folks end up locked in prison or dead
I don’t really think these people understand how deep it get
It ain’t none of nobody business who Tasha sleepin’ with
Your friend opened up to you, poured out her soul
How the whole hood know when you the only one she told
Now somebody ‘bout to get touched, the facts got mixed up
And by the time the story make it back to you it switched up
You walkin’ through the neighborhood, vibe feeling shady
Wondering why people looking at you all crazy
See your mouth need to be stopped up
Who smokin’, who knocked up
Can’t wait to tell the whole world who baby daddy locked up
It’s like I’m watching tv when the drama start boosting
A reality show, Real Hoodrats of Houston starring

Mess
This is a song about mess
Do people really act like this? Yes
Always trippin’ on everybody else, need to worry ‘bout yourself

Your messy friend want your man, so she’s gonna pursue him
Told about y’all bed business, now she wanna do him
Lied about him laying with some girl who never knew him
And yo silly ass brought that lie back to him
Now he don’t know what you talkin’ ‘bout
Rumors flying out your mouth
He got mad, grabbed some clothes, went over his patna house
One week, two weeks, you thinkin’ ‘I hope he call’
Same one who told the lies now consoling both of y’all
Tellin’ you he's just a dog
Tellin’ him no trust at all
Showtime Apollo, she can’t wait to touch his log
Now she’s at the door, it took her one month to perfect the stunt
You ain’t know until you saw him kissin’ in the restaurant
Surprise, surprise, you can’t believe your eyes
But you believed in lies so that led to broken ties
You say the devil is a lie, yeah, but he ain’t underground
The devil you need to watch are the ones you hang around starting

Mess
This is a song about mess
Do people really act like this? Yes
Always trippin’ on everybody else, need to worry ‘bout yourself

On they belly is the only way a snake could crawl
You cussin’ out people on they Facebook wall
Over who wife messin’ over them, who husband done burnt off
Who don’t pay they child support, who lights got turnt off
And you so boo boo
Jealous ‘cause yo homegirl gettin’ a hundred dollars more food stamps than you do
And what about the dudes who gossip like ladies?
As long as there’s beef, it can never be all gravy
Starting controversy is what messy people gotta do
What’s they favorite line? “Man, I wouldn’t take that if I was you”
“Hey, you didn’t hear this from me”
I heard ‘em all, I know the list
Best one ever — “Ay, don’t tell nobody I told you this”
Spreading mess all over town
Everybody name gettin’ ran in the ground
The person who started it up from the jump ain’t never around when it all go down
Fussin’ about who bought the most name brand from the mall
When Hilfiger and Gucci don’t give a damn about none of y’all

Mess
This is a song about mess
Do people really act like this? Yes
Always trippin’ on everybody else, need to worry ‘bout yourself
See
This is how people get beat up
This is how people get beat up

See, you got a messy friend or know somebody who's messy, please play this song for ‘em, this is they theme song, this has been a ghetto public service announcement brought to you by K-Rino and the South Park Coalition, thank you",https://genius.com/K-rino-mess-lyrics
O.G. Salute,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"One time for the boys who laid the foundation
O.G. Salute, O.G. Salute, O.G. Salute
If it ain’t you, don’t claim it, get it in

One time for the boys that done bled the block
Now they shacked down on that bus, headed out
Did what they had to do whether scared or not
Them the ones that the hood can’t forget about
So much game that it might give your brain a cramp
Thrown straight up in the fire, no training camp
A lot of boys talk a good game
Tryna get a few women and some hood fame
No actors man, this for real
Street skills so his family never missed a meal
And it’s a day to day operation
CEO of your own ghetto corporation
Since they don’t wanna give us reparation
We pull our pants down on ‘em fool, defecation
And we gon’ give it to whoever want it
Boys talking like they did it but they never done it

Yeah, this the O.G. Salute
Yo hood, this the O.G. Salute
My hood, the O.G. Salute
My folks be the truth with proceeds to boot
Come on, O.G. Salute
Every city, O.G. Salute
Worldwide, this the O.G. Salute
My folks be the truth with proceeds to boot

One time for the soldiers if y’all wanna know
And I ain’t talking about the ones that’s in the army, bro
Set up shop ‘cause he had to make some longer dough
Made 20 racks at the neighbourhood corner store
Boys coming out the jacket with a dope packet
Clean serve after clean serve, no racket
You can’t relax with a snitch around
Two strikes and the judge is on the pictures mound
Your partner gone, you can’t let that get you down
Had to step the game up and cover bigger ground
Get it in until there ain't no money left to make
Smart enough to learn from somebody else mistakes
As long as he comes first, that’s number one
Never turn cutthroat once the money come
Trained by the streets, certified tougher than leather
Real O.G.s know they can’t hustle forever

Yeah, this the O.G. Salute
Yo hood, this the O.G. Salute
My hood, the O.G. Salute
My folks be the truth with proceeds to boot
Come on, O.G. Salute
Every city, O.G. Salute
Worldwide, this the O.G. Salute
My folks be the truth with proceeds to boot

How they blame us when they the ones feeling the drama
J-Flex in the pen for defending his mama
Every day by the police, we get harassed
But every time they beat our ass they get a pass
Five cats here to lick, now they wanted men
One got caught didn’t tell, took it on the chin
Better keep his books loaded up with no stress
Holding down for his family for the whole stretch
And you ain’t never got your hands dirty
You in the game tryna wear another man’s jersey
Every day is a dollar day
Wannabe’s get spotted from a mile away
You still tryna keep the scam up
Boys’ll get it in for real, getting jammed up
Staying down, never change, I’m the same guy
You know a real G, never let their name die

Yeah, this the O.G. Salute
Yo hood, this the O.G. Salute

Time For You,Mind Vision,2019.0,"Once again, we get ready to travel down that road that many of us have gone down many times before, yet somehow we still continue to go

I’m a busy busy man but I always got time for you, for you
I’m a busy busy man but I always got time for you, for you

I remember the day you walked in
I damn near fell down and busted my chin
I zeroed in and got ready to attack it
This one right here had the whole package
Hands got sweaty, I’m nervous but that’s cool
Stomach moving like I had ate some bad food
I was staring, go and tell if you want
(Man, looks shouldn’t matter) The hell if they don’t
Slow motion like a movie scene
Her skin was pristine, smooth and clean
I’ve been searching for you all my life
Looking like Sunshine from Harlem Nights
She’s the type that just know she fine
If another dude come, we’ll both be tryin’
She could have a whole basket full of stuff and I’ll let her skip me at the grocery line
Never knew a lady that I wanted this badly
If she got kids, yup I’m the new daddy
So let’s get ready to rumble
Here’s some money, girl, go buy you some bundles
Because you deserve that
Your attractiveness put me like a purse snatch
Chasing you got my nerves racked
I’m calling in sick to a job I don’t even work at
Yep, I’m a fool again
When I see ya, it be like I’m in school again
‘cause I get choked up ’til I ain’t no good
She smart as hell but she ain’t scared of the hood

I’m a busy busy man but I always got time for you, for you
Yeah I know I had some plans but just tell me what you tryna do

Yeah man, I pulled her, I’m proud to admit it
We goin’ to eat tonight, yeah let’s get it
Your boy don’t dress up, I keep it kinda basic
But she so special I’d pick her up in a spaceship
When she need me I’m at the scene
Got a face that could be on a magazine
When she call, I be answering fast and clean
I be picking up the phone on half a ring
So now we at the spot
I was floatin’ through the place like a astronaut
Dude in the restaurant was shook when she was comin’
He was wishin’ he could look but he was sittin’ with his woman
I knew exactly what he’s thinking without asking
I laughed and snuck him a quick dap when I passed him
Because I been there too
But tonight K’s foot wasn’t in that shoe
Later on on the phone we was in that mood
Said she got a picture for me, gon’ send that through
And nah, it wasn’t nothin’ nasty
The classy is still the best way to grab me
Bein’ patient I’m learnin’ how
But if she wanna send me one I won’t turn it down, I’m sayin’
Should never be alone with K
Call me up 4am, I be on my way
And y’all dudes playin’ dumb and slow
Don’t be actin’ like you never been sprung before
I ain’t sayin’ that I’m sprung, I’m aight, bro, trust me
But she give me such a rush and her feet ain’t crusty
It’s a trip how she takin’ my heart, bro
Got me goin’ to plays, museums and art shows
Don’t wanna make it look too suspicious
She could burn my food, I be like “ooh, delicious”
And I’ll do the dishes
This is not a fluke, I ain’t superstitious
My ex girl all pissed at me
She said, “You ain’t never acted like this with me,” Yeah
‘cause you be actin’ uppy for days
You need to use her as a role model, study her ways
But you was too much drama though, f’ sho
Hold on, somebody’s on my other line, uhh, that’s her, time to go

I’m a busy busy man but I always got time for you, for you
Yeah I know I had some plans but just tell me what you tryna do",https://genius.com/K-rino-time-for-you-lyrics
Who’s The Man,Danger Zone,1995,"Don’t ya run up, I’m coming from the front
I’m coming from the back, but see this is a different kind of jack
Don’t react, I’m swinging with a brick, trick
Suckers realize compared to this Vietnam was like a picnic
Cops persecute me, they can’t dispute me
But I hesitate to break ‘cause if I run he’s gonna shoot me
In the back, no I’m not scared but I’m cautious
The thought of me dying, coughing blood makes me nauseous
So when they let me go I load up, see it’s time to make ‘em choke up
High explosives on the stage has left him broke up
I would have dropped the whole stall of ‘em
But it ain’t enough room on one milk carton for all of 'em
Now I’m a fugitive from justice, so bust this
Go get your crew, I’ll get my crew and we’ll discuss this
But this discussion might get thoughts sprayed
And when it’s all said and done, blacks gon’ all be paid, so uhh…

(Who’s the man that the cops can’t stand?)
A brother in the streets making more than they can
(Who’s the man that the cops can’t stand?)
Fifteen, twenty-five, thirty grand

It’s like this, you’re pulling up behind me
One in my place, they pull me over on a dark road so no one can find me
They’re taking me a fool, man
But me see them wanan book me with them automatic tool, man
I had a vision that he shot me
I know they thinking that they got me, but I’m K-Rino, my name ain’t Rodney
“Put your hands on your head or taste the lead”
Ain’t no fronting, at this point I’m kind of scared
Do or die was my choice, right?
So I chose die, ran through some weeds and hid all night
Lights flashing, cops riffing, dogs sniffing
I’m laying in a ant bed but I ain’t tripping
‘Cause I’d rather get bit by a few bugs
Than feel my body get hit by a few slugs
I barely escaped the chrome
Said a prayer to Allah, counted my money, then I walked home


I was riding down the streets on my way home
Cops pull us over said he clocked us doing 50 in a school zone
Snatched us out to disrespect us
Face to the hood, hands behind our backs, laughing while they checked us
“I know you’re selling dope,” that’s what he came with
Didn’t wanna jet because I saw his partners aim get
Focused, reaching in my pockets for a stash
All he found was a couple of phone numbers and a lot of cash
“Where’d you get this money from?” is what he asked me
Told me if I slurred or tried to lie that he would blast me
Seven days a week, twelve months a year they just harass me
Bad enough I’m in the hood with bullets flying past me
Crowd gathers 'round and says K-Rino what’s the problem
Cops stay on my jock and plus somebody said I robbed him
Found out I’m a rapper and the name was K-Rino
And the bank was from a show that I had rocked the night before, so…",https://genius.com/K-rino-whos-the-man-lyrics
Get It Off Ya Chest,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"Man, you still talking, you still tryna test me
Your boys already took off running
Now what you gonna do?
You gonna get it off your chest or are we gonna sit here and talk about it?
Now what you gonna do?

If it's a problem when you see me, let it be addressed
We grown men, don't hold it in boy, get it off your chest
Don't beat around the bush, let's square it off and kill the plex
You felt the first one, them boys you came with come duress

I'm stretching haters out like plastic men, I blew 'em away just like a drastic wind
I've got a 6 foot hole that I'm dying to put your casket in
If you ain't knowing about my skill level, go ask a friend
You got a beef card with my name on it, come cash it in
Know that's my title that you holding boy, 
And it's my bedroom that your girlfriend is relaxing in
I hold my power boy just like Shaq when he bats it in
In fact my words attack the mic before the tracks begin
I got a Black Book that I wrote this killer passage in
Walk in a store with a MAC-10 wearing a black mask and 
Whether or not I spare your life or kill your ass depends
You took off first and ran real fast but came in last again
Throw caution to the wind, I swing and catch a bastard’s chin
His cranium was the spot that he got blasted in
I'm aggravated for detention G  degree
They tapped my phone so telepathic messages I had to send

If it's a problem when you see me, let it be addressed
We grown men, don't hold it in boy, get it off your chest
Don't beat around the bush, let's square it off and kill the plex
You felt the first one, them boys you came with come duress

You were Glass Menagerie
The coroner had to be fast with his math to accurately calculate what my vocal murder average be
Instinctively tell, I sink you and bail
I spit so many bars at you boy you gon' think you in jail
I supply ink on paper, so before you decide to drop, think
I do a year’s work in the time span of an eye blink
Of course they'll hate, hoping to translate what I mandate
What I indoctrinate, intoxicates, now they can't stand straight
Keep your smile and your handshake for my handbrake
In a man's plate from a planned quake in a high velocity and land great
I stand elite and represent for the street
My agg demeanour served as a perfect complement to the heat
My style is harder loc, K-Rino got more heart than an artichoke
I thought the bar was 9 months pregnant 'cause its water broke
I see through games, so when you wonder I start proving why
I'm focused enough to see eye to eye with a moving fly

If it's a problem when you see me, let it be addressed
We grown men, don't hold it in boy, get it off your chest
Don't beat around the bush, let's square it off and kill the plex
You felt the first one, them boys you came with come duress

Understand the world revolves around money and gunfire
Whatever level the greatest took you to, I'ma take you one higher
My brain travels in the fast lane
Each one of my books is a drop of water, my mind is a cloud from which I cast rain
It ain't no rules in the cash game
I'm listening to masses claim they have knowledge while carrying the Devil's last name
You wonder why we young and aggravated
'Cause we've been bred with self hatred, locked up and miseducated
In a world designed to twist minds and blind us
The average ghetto street is where you will us with the police right behind us
Devilish hands that keep the peace stranded from you
I'm a man who understands that land is worth more than money
My flsh is weak so in this world it ain't too hard to tempt me
But I'll die holding my nuts before I'll let a man pimp me
Parasites, I make 'em bleed like a padded woman
I ain't no instigator, so if I dissed him, he had it coming

Hey Murder what up man with these boys out here, man?
Holding their water like women, man
Man, I think they just frustrated and aggravated
You know what I'm saying
This is a man's game right here
You got something to say just come out and say it
I don't care...
I feel that but these boys don't feel what's going on in these streets
For sure, but then you bring it to their grill they looking at you like you violating when you know they was talking down
Yeah, but a lot of them just talking loud but not saying nothing
Yeah, running around wearing panties and 
Grown men wearing panties and 
For sure and we out man",https://genius.com/K-rino-get-it-off-ya-chest-lyrics
Must Wanna Die,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"Why
We ‘bout to show ‘em how it goes down
People playing with me, they must wanna die
The Coalition don’t fuck around, still representing that Southside
We ‘bout to show ‘em how it goes down
Took ‘em from they family, make ‘em wanna cry
K-Rino me never fuck around, yeah

You nasty bastards, I drop higher scholastics
Mathematics couldn’t calculate the number of caskets
I teach the masses, pull out a piece and blast it
And leave pain and hand grenades up in your Easter baskets
To flip graphics like K-Rino, you need gymnastics
Rip gashes, you play me, hoe, you leave in plastic
I breed Jurassic and reproduce the fastest
Nullify your oxygen supply with loose elastics hey
To take me out, you need a fight plan, man
I spit a verse so hard on stage the mic stand ran
The cynical phrase pinnacle, lyrically ecumenical
 function identical to octopus tentacles
It’s enough I split heads and leave ‘em divided
Break your whole body in half and leave ya ass one sided, ay
And if you’re looking for a skull, I got it
I chuck it in somebody yard and let a pitbull hide it

Why
We ‘bout to show ‘em how it goes down
People playing with me, they must wanna die
The Coalition don’t fuck around, still representing that South

The dean of killing with kidnap classes
Call me for real, keep two clips, they flip like Dwayne Wayne glasses
You think I give a fuck about your chain and all that bragging?
Jack K’s Black Book  bean pie and go Platinum
I spit that shit you can’t fathom, watch me crack ‘em
Got stock options in here because all the bodies I be bagging
I be dragging dead people through mud, backwoods and sticks, man
Got Atari 2600 that play Playstation 6 games
Now what’s my fix, man? It goes like this, man
I jump through your ears and start Crip walking up on your bitch brain
Mass murderer, kill your whole family in one bunch
Eat ‘em for lunch, that’s what I like to call black history month
I’m on the hunt, you feel this? Erase your mind
You couldn’t reminisce if your bitch ass was on OS-10 peeling ‘cause we the realest
Got that high like smoking on nine sweets
You can’t fuck with Bang,  in the bed poking on nine freaks

Why
We ‘bout to show ‘em how it goes down
People playing with me, they must wanna die
The Coalition don’t fuck around, still representing that South

With an array of flows, I spray foes
Depending on how you lived your life, I distribute horns or halos
A 9 will leave you with a blown mind
I call your house up aggravated and snatched your ass through the phone line
Dinner with K, you need a strong mind
‘cause like a broke ass clock, you hanging around at the wrong time
Could still see you if I go blind
I know your DNA is messed up, I ain’t trippin’, you can clone mine
I run with  Bang and Big Doc
My brain power is so great, I can think and mentally pick locks
Thinking you harder, dude, you dead wrong
My body vanished at the mic and all they saw was floating headphones
I don’t need heat to blast you
Your family found out it was me you was dissing and whooped your ass too
Vocal murder I’m manifesting
And I don’t wanna hear that whining, just answer the damn question

Why
We ‘bout to show ‘em how it goes down
People playing with me, they must wanna die

Old and New,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"There's an interesting dynamic starting to develop
Old rapper, new rapper, old rapper, new rapper
Yeah, let's see what's going on
Old rapper, new rapper, haha
Boys tripping out here, tell y'all the difference
Listen!

New rappers pop tags, new rappers got swag
Old rapper heard a new rapper spitting and got mad
Old rapper said that the new rapper should not brag
On jewelry and cash and what they consider hot trash
Youngster said, ""Whatever you old rappers did, we shot past
1998 was the year that your product dropped last""
Old rapper said, ""But we got skills that y'all cannot grasp
We did it for years, after two albums y'all flop fast""
The young man said, ""You jealous of what they pay me, bro
You're whole career's money can't compare to what I make at shows""
Old rapper shook his head and said, ""Yeah, maybe so
Buy y'all can never do it like we did it back in '84
See most of y'all are just a passing phase""
The new rapper laughed and said, ""flip 84 around fool, that's your age
Now you say we arrogant but that was kind of funny
You working at Khans and I'm making all kinds of money""

Old rapper, new rapper steady bumping heads
Old rapper, new rapper need to clique up instead
Old rapper, new rapper, yeah that's what I said
Instead of tripping on who better, why don't we all just get this bread?

The O.G. said, ""Laugh all you want but young man you're wrong
The nerve of you to disrespect the foundation you standing on
Being humble while your strong is what I'm recommending
No one who blew up ever pictured their run ever ending
You doing shows worldwide and your record's spinning
But the game is long, don't get kicked out in the second inning
Longevity I got is what you wanna get""
New rapper said, ""Yeah, my Daddy used to jam you on cassette
But all jokes aside, something that you should consider
When y'all are no loner relevant y'all start acting bitter
There's lots of older rappers eating, I can name plenty of names
Instead of hating on our fame won't you give me some game?
And I can give you game 'cause you need understanding now
We selling digital units, merchandise and branding now
And some of us are disrespectful, but so are y'all""
Old rapper said, ""Yeah, pride come before a fall""

Old rapper, new rapper steady bumping heads
Old rapper, new rapper need to clique up instead
Old rapper, new rapper, yeah that's what I said
Instead of tripping on who better, why don't we all just get this bread?

It's hard for old school artists to breathe in these climates
They wish that they was part of rap's current economics
Instead of grinding they stay confined in making comments
About how this generation refuse to pay them homage
Youngsters in the game wanna see their name with greats
But old rappers and new rappers make the same mistakes
If you real, you last forever, time can't erase
The labels drained us all but we never blame the snakes
We see the same reflection, just looking in different mirrors
We walk the same roads, just did it in different eras
The new rappers say they hate on our accomplishments
The old rappers say the new lacking in consciousness
Working with each other ought to be what the mission is
We can agree to disagree on our differences
Young G, I know you're hungry and you're feisty
But never criticize something that one day you might be",https://genius.com/K-rino-old-and-new-lyrics
Hardest Clique,No Mercy,1999.0,"SPC is the hardest clique
DBX don’t give a fuck ‘cause you a star that’s rich
When it comes to flow, we are the shit
We started this from the darkened mist
This Texas chainsaw slaughter shit
AC Chill is who I’m mobbing with
Gangsta NIP don’t even trip on who he squabbing with
We hard to hit and still on niggas talking shit
PSK gon’ grab your jaw and twist
Point Blank gon’ fuck you, bitch, even though your father’s strict
We are the risk when you target ditch, your car get hit
Now spark and spit, you’re dumped in the darkest ditch
And five-o ain’t solving shit
They acting fraudulent when we walk into the park to sit
You wanna snitch on DBX, I beg your pardon, bitch

If you don’t give a fuck, nigga, then throw it up
If your clique be coming down, nigga, then throw it up
If your clique be popping trunk, nigga, then throw it up
If you fuck with SPC, nigga, you know you fucked, man
Hold up, nigga
The diabolical, dead hair follicles cause baldness
Mass murder’s what you call this
What determines which clique’s the hardest
What makes the hardest rap artist the motherfucker that stays the same regardless
From ‘8-6 to 2G
Just take a long look at me
I ain’t Ginuwine but I’m the same fucking G
Still hoop and Macgregor, still kick a rhyme whenever
Down to flip or fuck some hoes
Still down for whatever

The hardest motherfucking clique coming straight out the Park
And get your head split bitch ‘cause this axe blade sharp
And keep it like that, nigga, the game is real
You must be sick if you think a psychopath won’t kill
Now let me take a second just to tell you what I’m about
And try to  everybody in this bitch no doubt
You want a nigga to run inside this bitch and handle his business
You want a nigga to run inside this bitch and murder the witness
And move something motherfucker, the psych might do ya
(*mouth sound*) just like some sand when the wind went through ya
Don’t give a motherfuck, nigga, the pallbearer’s inside
Adding up the money he would make if six niggas died

Playboy, it’s whatever, whenever, however you want it
Been on that other level, nigga, quick to severe opponents
So fuck the world, shit trick, me and my clique forever on it
They call us hustle gang vest, these youngsters caught up in the moment
You heard’a me, same nigga set up shop and hooked it with cookies that weighed 33
I got niggas that watch my figures, tryna murder me
Miss me with it, I’m SPC, playboy, since ’93
This for the ballers and the geekers, the crawlers and the creepers
The 20 inch skaters, the park bench haters
Capping but you can’t fade us, bitch, you down in your gators
Slap a nigga for practice, bad actors major factors
These the niggas I started with (Now what?)
That SPC, best believe that we the hardest clique

Point Blank was richer with the crumbs before you got the bricks
I’m the one when I hold three trigger your face, I slap the bitch
I put our load on top of my load and I ran with it
The same shit you rap about hate to see me live it
Now who the fuck you was talking about in that rhyme you spit?
All that giggling shit, think a nigga ain’t listening to yo ass, boy
Give me some space before I slap you with my dick
You worse than a dry pussy bitch, can’t even get my finger wet, and yeah
Back in high school, I heard you was a punk
Always calling home, “Mama, mama, help, they tryna beat me up!”

I metamorphosize into a new advanced fully enhanced
Super brain hurricane against the grain, see futures at a glance
Take a chance with the hood professor but don’t try to wreck
Be 34 and rap opponents 30 styles and 30 dialects
No mouth popping if you ever say my clout dropping
Watch me run a thousand laps around your ass without stopping
Proceeding to rip a style, I verbally trip a while
And smile and whip a pile of hoes, hit ‘em, they flip a mile
You played with K-Rino, stayed with it for days
Made your face look like a grenade, hit it 400 ways
You holler, “Why me?” I called his house, I knew he was home
His caller ID said, “Man, you better not pick up that phone”
Poets are prolific, proportioning, posing paralysis
Critical writer, verse wrote when existing didn’t exist
Crash the show and scared the coldest rhymesayers to death

Fix It, Conception of Concept (The Big Seven #2),2016.0,"Sometimes we pass false judgements, stay mad and hold grudges
Walking ‘round loveless, indulging in hateful subjects
Once was best friends, now ex-friends, problems between kinfolks
Years gone out the window, a tight bond that been broke
So now you flame-fanning, disrespecting and slandering
Willing to end it all behind one misunderstanding
One argument sparked the whole plot, weeks passed and it don’t stop
And peace was hard to reach because pride has become a roadblock
And usually the issue is something petty and little
Controversy and drama split families down the middle
Over money, over dudes, over women and dumb decisions
Business is our religion, envy and competition
Whenever that name is mentioned, you escape the discussion
Straight to hatred you rushing, blood relation is nothing
It escalates to a hurt race and homicide’s the worst case
Sometimes they don’t remember how it started in the first place

I can’t believe y’all still tripping on that
It’s been too long, too much time gone by
Whatever’s going on, y’all need to fix and go back
‘Cause life is too short to hold a grudge, no lie
I can’t believe y’all still tripping on that
It’s been too long, too much time gone by
Whatever’s going on, y’all need to fix and go back
‘Cause life is too short to hold a grudge, no lie, no lie

Y’all used to ride daily, now all I hear is a bunch of snapping
Never considering the chances that something could happen
To one of y’all, so when it does, then you put the hate up
Breaking down at the funeral, wishing y’all could of made up
Now it’s too late to fix bro, difficult to admit though
Mutual friends then telling y’all to let that shit go
The partnership was strong, G, helped each other on feet
Your children and your wives used to be tight and now they don’t speak
The ego is a beast though, it’s crazier than I thought
Nobody wants to be the first to tell the other, “My fault”
So all them years erased now and chalked up as a waste now
You pass them on the street like you don’t even know they face now
But in your mind you feel blue, just go on and keep it real, fool
You can’t lie to yourself, you know you wish that y’all was still cool
Stubbornness is an illness, ugliness is revealed quick
Scuffling to rebuild is the struggle you got to deal with

I can’t believe y’all still tripping on that
It’s been too long, too much time gone by
Whatever’s going on, y’all need to fix and go back
‘Cause life is too short to hold a grudge, no lie
I can’t believe y’all still tripping on that
It’s been too long, too much time gone by
Whatever’s going on, y’all need to fix and go back
‘Cause life is too short to hold a grudge, no lie, no lie

If there’s someone you ain’t spoken to in years, you need to call ‘em
‘Cause God forbid an unfortunate incident befalls ‘em
You’ll be happy that you fought through and that don’t make you soft, dude
Forgiving clears your spirit and raises that tension off you
The day your mama died, it left the family divided
Denied what she advised and let greediness override it
And honoring her wishes, that’s a blessing in itself
But y’all fighting each other over possessions that she left
And when you finally get ‘em, then you start messing up pulling stunts
What she worked her whole life to build, you lost in a few months
Then when wise words came, not one of y’all would accept ‘em
Y’all care about the things that were left more than who left ‘em
So now we see three losses instead of one apparently
Your loved ones, the things they had and the bond of a family
Overpowered by vanity and a sensitive mind
And running ‘round here now like you working with infinite time

I can’t believe y’all still tripping on that
It’s been too long, too much time gone by
Whatever’s going on, y’all need to fix and go back
‘Cause life is too short to hold a grudge, no lie
I can’t believe y’all still tripping on that
It’s been too long, too much time gone by
Whatever’s going on, y’all need to fix and go back
‘Cause life is too short to hold a grudge, no lie, no lie

Keep your head to the sky and you’ll get past these days
Learn that trouble won’t last always
Lord be a’willing and the creek gon’ rise
Anything broke you can fix in your life
Keep your head to the sky and you’ll get past these days
Learn that trouble won’t last always
Lord be a’willing and the creek gon’ rise
Anything broke you can fix in your life",https://genius.com/K-rino-fix-it-lyrics
Bad Bizness,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"I'm tired of boys jumpin' in the game acting like they invented it
Hollerin' that they gangsters but they never represented it
Real Gs heard your shit and instantly resented it
Claimin' hood strife that you ain't never been presented with
Now the streets is talkin' killers out here wanna touch your head
Aggravated 'cause they found out who ya is and what ya said
Partner if you ain't hard, don't act hard, just be yourself
Caught up in the mix is how you 
Frontin' like a gangster is just somethin' that you try to do
How'd you like to find out that your favorite rapper lied to you?
Sellin'  on the mic would be a threat to you
Harder than a motherfucker 'til somebody step to you
Win or lose, stand up and fight, man  hands
Understand you ain't gotta act gangster to be a man
Cappin' on your CDs, but I can see the game in it
K-Rino is real, I ain't livin' it I ain't claimin' it

Boys operatin' on bad bizness
You keep it up and you'll be livin' in your last minutes
Somebody told me all money ain't good money but no money's worse
Don't even speak about no work unless you're payin' me first

I need to explain somethin' to y'all who want K to spit a verse
Don't approach me about business until you got the paper first
I'ma piss on your situation, no love included
No exception to the rule, major label or independent
Simple and plain, I'm all about collecting my change
You disrespected me but also disrespected the game
When you got the dividends you can hand me the track then
And you can save that talk about payin' me on the back end
You dealin' with pros, so I'ma expose you hoes
That go from compilation sixteen bar flows at shows
Playin' games and finna get your ass beat purple
I spit free for only a few and you ain't in that circle
If you comin' at me real man I'll cut you a deal
My response all depends only on what you reveal
Don't even fix your mouth to ask me what I charge for a song
If you ain't ready to break bread get your punk ass on


And I don't send my music into major labels, they crooks
You'll mess around and hear mainstream rappers fittin' your hooks
Instead of signin' you they stealin', that's how bastards get hurt
Then got the nerve to come to your city and do a concert
Man I can't count how many rappers that done stole my lines
And I done heard my hooks and concepts at least twenty times
I gotta tell it, 'cause it'll happen forever if I let it
These bastards know they stole your shit and won't give you credit
Hollywood hoes, I bust you in the mouth and smile
Worthless-ass rappers makin' millions offa your style
And I ain't trippin' on no paper, I don't want one dime
But motherfuckers, speak my name when you speak my lines",https://genius.com/K-rino-bad-bizness-lyrics
It’s Always One,American Heroes (The Big Seven #5),2016.0,"Man if you know this
Every time somethin' goes down in a black community
The first thang they do
Is bring some over black person on the TV screen
To justify the wrong that just happened to the black person
See that's all set up by these news networks man
Don't pay attention to these rat soup eatin' bastards man
Get the real
C'mon

When you watch Fox News just sit back y'all
Every time somethin' go down they get that call
Black person gets killed by a cops assault
Another black coon sayin' it's the victims fault
Look at him grinnin' and cheesin', he's so smiley
Can't wait to show his loyalty to Bill O'Reilly
Any other time Bill would be cuttin' you off
But since you sellin' out your people he gon' let you talk
I'm shakin' my head, trippin' on how fake you are
You said the cop was in the right
Damn, what tape you saw?
You done straight came off like a phony and lied
Talkin' 'bout he would've lived if he'd only complied
The folks that hate us most is the people you trust
Who the hell told your dumb ass you speakin'' for us
 seven time that you get yo chance
But if we put you in the hood you will shit your pants

Kinda funny how that's the only time we see you
It's sickening
What's happening in the minds of these dudes
I be wonder where the hell they be findin' these fools
And these dumb chicks too, I ain't with that yet
You gotta drop it like it's hot just to get that check
See the news networks slick way to be racist
Is to get dumb black folks to make those statements
They don't even recognize how they mind done flip
Cosignin' like you tryin' to help 'em buy 'em a whip
See pimpin' ain't dead 'cause I'm watchin' the show
Gotta prove to white america that you's a good ho

They probably the worse
You let these slimy politicians all in your church
You let 'em in the pulpit, let 'em sing in the choir
Whole congregation clappin' for this slick ass liar
Why he comin' to the church now? he never been which ya
Now you gigglin' and linin' up to take you a picture
He a killer layin' in the weeds ready to get ya
Bet his ass couldn't quote one line of the scripture
They just want the black vote, he don't have no respect
Oh, I get it now, He done cut the pastor a check
So you lead the sheep to slaughter, glad to elect
But once he get elected you suffer the after effect
You big dummy, you don't even know how he come at ya
Three years and he ain't done anything he promised ya
Now you tryin' to call him, but that didn't work
He changed his number the same day he left your church, fool

Boy, I tell ya

Fly High,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"Yeah
I woke up this morning
I had wings sprouting out my back
So I flew high through the sky
And started murdering emcees
Listen

I bark verbs and nouns like bloodhounds for 320 rounds
With poliomyelitis-infected rain coming down
Towns swim in my crown until all the citizens drown
Psychedelic verses project optical image for sound
They search my  for boundaries, no limits were found
Radioactive biochemicals were then timidly scrounged
A chemist said the remnants he found were from a line some clown attempted to down
Poisonous plasma ’til his hemorrhage was brown
Breaking your jaw, trachea straw and shrink so far
Swallowing spit'll be like sucking a cantaloupe through a straw
The rabid animal who bench-pressed the weight without a pole
With a hand of gold, the most polymorphic and manifold
Before we abort ‘em, first we chronologically sort ‘em
My house from roof to floor is draped in postmortem decorum
Drinking the flame, I’m the main link in the chain
I use a hypodermic pen to shoot ink in my veins and fly high

La la la la la
La la la
I won’t be happy ’til I see you die
La la la la
La la la la la
I fly high
La la la la
La la la
Won’t be happy ’til I see you die
La la la la
Yeah
La la la
Tell us what’s up, boy

What I decreed made a hater bleed
I play the lead and read at a greater rate of speed
And all without the aid of weed
We thought-programmers with microchip cameras
Pages hang high from my ceiling like championship banners
I’ll climb seven million miles into the sublime
Search every minuscule centimeter of every planet’s design
Ignore great celestial fossils and archeological finds
A thousand years of time just to achieve the retrieval of a line
Before your boy could train him, I first had to extract
Every chromosome that was inside him, identify ‘em and name ‘em
Heat purify ‘em and flame ‘em
Then hang ‘em high over the Mediterranean
Open ‘em back up wide and perfectly rechain ‘em
My throat ejected pyrotechnics that shoots a viral infected message
As confusing as five dyslexics
The day you chose K to pursue was an abominable day for you
So hatefully I’ll disable you, then Satan’ll pray for you
I fly high

La la la la la
La la la
I won’t be happy ’til I see you die
La la la la
La la la la la
I fly high
La la la la
La la la
Won’t be happy ’til I see you die
La la la la
Yeah
La la la
Tell us what’s up, boy

Our clash is like a train smash and a set of eyelashes
Your whole left half is in the grass with bio-sized gashes
I flash my crown at any man with his hand hoping to grab it
Bite down and lift his cap up like a can-opener magnet
I asked him a question and he was so eager to impress
He broke down each anatomical compound humans possess
The way the ventricles respond during a cardiac arrest
The distinction between the divinely cursed and the blessed
The complete codex magic, a first page to the index
How a bee defies the flight law in two genetic lab tests
The density of dark matter, how thought data is processed
Before the question that I asked him, he coulda simply just said yes
You was ordered, drawn and quartered so I transport you to slaughter
Chinese water torture specialist who tortures the water
I cocked and shot a rhyme 
He said he’d rather me slap him in front of his son than spit a rhyme against him privately
I fly high

La la la la la
La la la
I won’t be happy ’til I see you die
La la la la
La la la la la
I fly high
La la la la
La la la
Won’t be happy ’til I see you die

Solutions,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Uh huh
We been knowin' for years
What the problems are
The issue is we goin’ in circles tryna figure out how to solve ‘em
That day got to come to an end, c'mon

I hear you talk about racial injustice
But we're not too many years from the back of the buses
The cops still killin’, we still talkin'
Screaming “no justice, no peace,” we still marchin'
I see community meetings at town halls
But ain't nobody there but grandpas and grandmas
You steady talk about gun reform
But it's still seemin' like everyone is armed (I ain't trippin')
The educational system is broken
The weed is synthetic but we still smokin’
We watch politicians stunt in the open
Knowin’ both candidates dirty but we keep votin'

We need solutions, if not we’ll forever be victims
We familiar with the problems but how do we fix ‘em?
It just seems like everybody's lips is bumpin'
Time is steady runnin' out, man, we gotta do something
Solutions, if not we’ll forever be victims
We familiar with the problems but how do we fix ‘em?
It just seems like everybody's lips is bumpin'
Time is steady runnin' out, man, we gotta do something

The hood's still got violence daily
All this dope got people actin' wild and crazy
Pill-poppin' for a quick release
But CVS and Walgreens slangin' more than the streets (Teach)
If pharmaceuticals are not the move and Ritalin got your five year old chopped and screwed
Innocent students gettin' shot in schools and it seemin' like we runnin' out of options, dude
Reality shows teachin' girls how to be hoes
And for a little dough, you can get ‘em out of they clothes
And fake rap pimps little boys and tryna be those
Now he's gone , deceivin' everybody he knows (Why?)
And you don't wanna go to war with them
He don't respect his daddy ‘cause he makin' more than him (slim)
Lookin' for love ‘cause now it's missin'
We gotta bring the family back together, how? I'm listenin'

We need solutions, if not we'll forever be victims
We familiar with the problems but how do we fix ‘em?
It just seems like everybody's lips is bumpin'
Time is steady runnin' out, man, we gotta do something
Solutions, if not we'll forever be victims
We familiar with the problems but how do we fix ‘em?
It just seems like everybody's lips is bumpin'
Time is steady runnin' out, man, we gotta do something

Listen
The solution is clear but it's not a two day war
The black man and woman gotta learn who they are
We been disconnected but the resurrection will start the second we're taught we are a reflection of god
When our names got taken, we were cast as worthless
A person with no identity can have no purpose
If we don't speak it then the history remains a secret
Those with the knowledge can't be too vain to teach it
Collective economics, gotta be determined to try it
Products in our own community, we sell it, we buy it
Study the science of business, teach, learn and apply it
Got us living stronger unity and never deny it
When jobs are up, then crime will naturally drop
Poverty will diminish, in time, it'll actually stop
And we won't ever have to fear brutality from a cop
‘cause we'll police our own communities, invaders get popped
We build our own schools where our children can dream
And the curriculum enhances their self-esteem
And the study of agriculture is one of the main rooms
Grow our own food, no poison is being consumed

We need solutions, if not we'll forever be victims
We familiar with the problems but how do we fix ‘em?
It just seems like everybody's lips is bumpin'
Time is steady runnin' out, man, we gotta do something
Solutions, if not we'll forever be victims
We familiar with the problems but how do we fix ‘em?
It just seems like everybody's lips is bumpin'
Time is steady runnin' out, man, we gotta do something",https://genius.com/K-rino-solutions-lyrics
AN OLD VERSE I DID SOME YEARS BACK,UnKnown,2018.0,"K-Rino, the Wizard
I got infinite words that I'm spitting to win
I hit you with a set of 5 like splitting a 10
I'm running through your girlfriend and I'm hitting her twin
I stand up and let me nut sacks sit on her chin
I got radioactive diction mixed in with a sinister track I'm blitzing
Like a meteorite, it hits and splits the greatest opposition
Nothing on the planet is out of my jurisdiction
Got  lyrical pharmaceuticals
Homicides are beautiful, stance is irrefutable
My mic flow might blow in a minute when recite so
Hypoallergenic psycho
Analytic concoct innovations
Who knows if K is the doctor or the patient?
Radio station detonation, I show domination whether realization or animation
Dope flows, I never react to those
The gat blows leaving holes in your back exposed
Counterintelligence cracked intergalactic codes
Chances of winning are slimmer than Michael Jackson's nose
Softer than cool whip coming up shorter than a dude straight out of the pool game that don't wanna fool with us
Stupid like putting a perm on your pubic hair then using peroxide to remove it
My sermon rates amongst the greats
Permeates and infiltrates internal gates
Even if we went to school together
You wouldn't be able to say you're in the same class as me
You are too mythical, K-rino the hieroglyphical
Prototypical digital, robotic original
My roots are not pursuable, what I do to you
Is so ruthless and brutal, your spirit ain't even viewable",https://genius.com/K-rino-an-old-verse-i-did-some-years-back-lyrics
Agitated,The Head Hunters (Mixtape),UnKnown,"Yeah, check me out
It’s your boy K-Rino
From H-Town to Germany
We agitated and aggravated
Listen

I’m feeling like a wanna bust somebody dead in the grill
Hit you so hard your blood will be scared to spill
You got blew out, failed before the first punch was threw out
No heart, we opened up your chest and pink butterflies flew out
Now it’s time for me to murder the beat
My rhymes grind your head up just like hamburger meat
You heard the elite vocals that’s passed out in the street
Choking on blood that was gushing from your mouth and your teeth
You too feminine to rap hard, you’ll break like a bottle
Better off tryna be America’s Next Top Model
I thirst for deeper knowledge but I don’t drink Sprite
I’m so tight that I could make a pen with no ink write
I walk through a bee swarm with no sweat in my palm
I overkill, I murder a roach with a hydrogen bomb
Let’s battle for your grill and when I win I’ll stomp in and crunch you
Then when I snatch it out your mouth I'll piss on it and flush it

I’m agitated, that means I’m mad at somebody
Every flow I spit, the laws find at least one body
Agitated, K-Rino the human lethal injection
Don’t laugh at the victims ‘cause you could be the next one

Your family members ain't even gonna claim you
Every crime I commit, the police are gonna blame you
You’re garbage just like a hundred pounds of litter
I drop heat and make paper like a was a counterfeiter
Cracked a rib on the mic giving all I can give
It’s going down like your little sister last night in my crib
My paragraph served as my epitaph, you laugh till the weapons grab
And I craft murder and mayhem in the aftermath
When I'm using plastic I get enthusiastic
Bruise your gastric intestinal passage and leave it oozing acid
I congregate with rap legends who are born with blessings
My presence left his spiritual essence laying in convalescence
My sound is profound, I was drafted in the first round
And I'm ready to battle this faggot as soon as he put his purse down
The atomic anomaly commonly described as human geometry
With the skill to make ocean water respond  to me

I’m agitated, that means I’m mad at somebody
Every flow I spit, the laws find at least one body
Agitated, K-Rino the human lethal injection
Don’t laugh at the victims ‘cause you could be the next one

What you spit is fraud, don’t try this at home partner ‘cause this is hard
Punish a squad and roll a double album a business card
And have room to spare, victims surviving is super rare
I'm with a space woman from Jupiter playing truth or dare
I break bones, lyrically rape songs
Show up at your home with a microphone and a Superman cape on
I quantum leap to different worlds when I sleep
And every time I go to bed I disappear in the sheets
You was on drugs to think that you can ever defeat me
You out of pocket like the cash of the fool who bet he could beat me
Uh, verses designed by cognitive minds
A million lines in a bank account where I deposited rhymes
I hold my weapon up, you want some new music keep checking up
I hook you up like a repossessed car to a record truck
And like rice in the Super Bowl, it’s hard to cover me
I cut my stomach open and give birth to another me

I’m agitated, that means I’m mad at somebody
Every flow I spit, the laws find at least one body
Agitated, K-Rino the human lethal injection
Don’t laugh at the victims ‘cause you could be the next one",https://genius.com/K-rino-agitated-lyrics
Can’t Keep Doing People Wrong,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"Hard to picture somebody being so coldblooded
That they could take a person down and leave their soul blooded
Have a person that love you and make ‘em your puppet
Taking kindness for weakness, that’s an old subject
When they finished, there’s usually nothing left over
Always tryna find someone to mess over
People try to show concern, hoping they will learn
They never think about their evil ’til the tables turn
Used to break in people’s houses, kicking open doors
So how you call yourself mad when they broke in yours?
Only a fool feels it’s ok to relinquish rules
You can’t do people any kind of way and think it’s cool
You did dirt all your life just to rise to power
That boomerang came back a thousand miles an hour
All the people that you ruined every episode
And now you begging for the sympathy you never showed

Tell me, tell me, how does it feel?
In order to get realness, you gotta be real
You gon’ keep acting a fool ’til somebody get killed
Will he still do it again? Yeah he probably will

Uh, you can’t keep doing people wrong
You can’t keep doing people wrong (Say that again)
You can’t keep doing people wrong
(You think it’s a game, don’t ya?)
You can’t keep doing people wrong

Yeah, loyalty is a trial and you failed the test
But payback is a B, I’ll let you spell the rest
What goes around comes around, that’s no game
When I say karma, I ain’t talking ‘bout a female’s name
You can get it how you get it, you already know
You plant seeds of destruction ‘cause you reap what you sow
You saw a dude drop his money and what did you do?
You picked it up by pretending you was tying your shoe
You came up on the lick at the expense of another 
You got bumed and pick pocketed by a decoy brother
You had the nerve to get mad, but when you look back
You see the cause and effect of your devious set
Consequences, repercussions is a phrase you should learn
And if there’s previous bad decisions, then you should be concerned
Because they will come back to get you and that is a fact
So if they give you too much change, just give it back

Tell me, tell me, how does it feel?
In order to get realness, you gotta be real
You gon’ keep acting a fool ’til somebody get killed
Will he still do it again? Yeah he probably will

I can’t believe you would do that woman like you did
Used to beat her down hard even in front of her kids
Right hand, left hand ’til her head would bleed
Got her walking on eggshells but scared to leave
Got the nerve to say you doing what you had to do
Anybody would be a upgrade compared to you
Black eyes and broke bones plus he wrecked her job
She couldn’t even call her mama, much less the laws
He killing her slow worse than it was before
All the while still telling her he love her though
Meanwhile using your hands and stealing your plan
Beating up a small woman made him feel like a man
You was whipping on her like you did that for a living
’til she finally filed charges, sent him to prison
When the inmates found out what he was in there for
They started kicking his ass daily like he did her so

Tell me, tell me, how does it feel?
In order to get realness, you gotta be real
You gon’ keep acting a fool ’til somebody get killed
Will he still do it again? Yeah he probably will

Uh, you can’t keep doing people wrong (You think it’s a game, don’t ya?)
You can’t keep doing people wrong (Say that again)
You can’t keep doing people wrong (You think it’s a game, don’t ya?)

Yeeeah! We gon send this one out, to all these scared to death negros
In the streets, in the suites, at yo job, under their own roof
Hiding under covers, grown men wearing panties in their own house!
Listen, listen...
(K-Rino)
What's your purpose in the game? fool let's get things straight
All you ever brought to the table was a fork and a plate
How we gon elevate? throat cutting never decrease
You steady tryna start war I'm tryna delegate peace
We tryna mash up in these streets you road blocking the grind
I'm tryna stop boys from doing dope you steady supplying
Trusting dead hopeless wounded bad and fake inside
Love is on life support and happiness got murdered for smiling
We loving G that's why you give em words that don't benefit them
We tryna stay away from the police you chopping game with em (snitch!)
Making money and live good is the general consistence
We the hater's terminators if you ain't with us you against us
Hook
When the haters in the game start mentioning yo name
Throwing dirt telling lies tryna knock you out the frame
Call um out! Don't be playing around with em'
Call um out! Don't be staying down with em'
(K-Rino)
What the hell is you a sensitive thug?
I would give you a hug but I prefer a 38 slug
To the side of yo skull and open up a circular plug
And let the contents of yo mug spill all over the rug
You talk a lot of gangsta talk but weak as your athiest
I can detect hating and fakeness from a 90 mile radius
They used to say the devil made them do it no shame
But boys is coming up with things now that the devil won't claim
I'm from the hood where murders get ignored and folks get framed
When the streets talk better hope that they don't mention yo name
And if you doing dirt then do it by yourself no crew
So if you get caught can't nobody tell on you but YOU..
Hook
(K-Rino)
Call um out when they killing the mood
When you tryna feed the family but they hogging the food
If somebody disrespect you or play with your cash
Do they ass like a sound system and put em' on blast
All that fronting that they do is affecting you
And if your PREACHER is a hypocrite then check him too
Don't let these vipers throw you off track and twist up the facts
Talking behind your back about business you tryna transact
And rule #1 in the Real Player Handbook
If you don't stand up for your's then you deserved to get it took
And it's an eye for an eye, a lick for a lick
And a life for a life, and haters they die quick
You punked out when it was time to face up to the powers
And got physically devoured cuz even God hates a coward
There your tongue cuz you ain't know what being real is about
You gon die anyway you might as well call um out...

Sit Down,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Man, y’all better get a hold of these youngsters early, before all hell break loose in your household, check it

She was young, she was free, she was known on the scene
Only problem was, homie, she was just sixteen
She was hangin’ out, 9, 10, 11 o’clock
Mama couldn’t tell her nothin’, daddy still on lock
Too advanced for them little boys, she liked men
If you got a live car, she would jump right in
Total stranger, it don’t matter, she would hop in fast
Smoke wit’ ‘em, drink wit’ ‘em, pop pills and smash
Pocket full of money every time she came home
Got clothes, tennis shoes and a new iPhone
Her mama know she can’t afford it so she checked her 
That’s when she told her mama, “Stay out of my business, I’m grown”
Leave the house at all times of night and won’t come back
Ain’t been to school in so long that she forgot where it’s at
Got pregnant by a dude who hit and left her alone

Your mama done gave up so your grandma took ya
No respect for the people that care ‘bout you
Now you bringin’ all kind of sh— in their house too
Nobody would ever think that you would go that far
You and your knucklehead partners went and stole that car
Got caught and apprehended, took straight to jail
And after all that, who was it that made your bail?

What If,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"You ever wonder what if you could go back in time and change the situation? Would it make things better, or would it make things worse? Listen

The other night I had a vision of
My whole life, joy, pain, hate and giving love
Pictured the bad side and I wish that I could change things
Soon as I did, I went comatose and drifted into a dream
Soon as I came to, I looked up and seen
A dope fiend that I grew up with, he was clean and 
Why was I seeing this? What could it mean?
I was living the flashback, reenacting the past scene
Right back to the day crack took over his mind
Had the chance to stop my boy before he hit it for the first time
I called out to him and got his attention
Viewed my presence as a method of divine intervention
Told him his wife was looking for him and she needed him quick
Made up a lie, told him to get home, said his baby was sick
He went home and never ever put the pipe to his face
But his little sister came through later and ended up taking his place
We wonder

What if you could go back in time
And relive moments you left behind?
Would life be better somehow
Knowing then what you know now?
What if you could go back again
And keep so many things from happening?
What if you could go back in time?

Now, next thing you know I quantum leap through the dark
I was mobbing with my OGs, we was back in The Park
I’m at the club with my homeboy, 1993
It was the night he first met his baby-mama to be
Four children later, homie went from balling to broke
‘cause she was stangin’ him for child support on all of ‘em, loc
He be saying if he could go back, he never would meet her
Knew I was flashing back and seen a chance for me to delete her
Soon as he got ready to step to her, I made up a tale
Told him her boyfriend was a killer that just raised out of jail
And he don’t bar busting a cap and going right back in
That’s when he changed his mind and never thought about her again
I was happy because I saved him, proud of what I had did
He can’t miss what he never had but I could picture his kids
In the end, I still lost something I tried to protect
Instead of riding with her, he left drunk and died in a wreck
We wonder

What if you could go back in time
And relive moments you left behind?
Would life be better somehow
Knowing then what you know now?
What if you could go back again
And keep so many things from happening?
What if you could go back in time?

I started wondering about the deepness of man
Do we control our destiny or are the secrets as planned?
Is it right to try to tap into the mystery source
And with no remorse attempt to alter history’s course?
Would it be cool if we could travel back and relive events
Now we resenting change, a pattern that was possibly meant
If you could take a negative part of your life and remove it
Is it guaranteed what you replace it with would improve it?
How many lives mighta been saved, how many mighta been ?
How many great men and women might not have ever been born?
If you get rid of all your struggles and all of your strife
You couldn’t fully appreciate what you accomplish in life
If you could redo your existence, would it properly suit ya?
Realize you can’t change the past, but you control the future
Truth is, once the time pass, ain’t no going back
So be grateful for what you are, homie, and build on that
We wonder

What if you could go back in time
And relive moments you left behind?
Would life be better somehow
Knowing then what you know now?

Yeah, ay, time is not reversible, man
You can only look forward
Live for today and the future, don’t live in the past
Look to the past to learn from your mistakes
But build on that, mane, ay",https://genius.com/K-rino-what-if-lyrics
Man Up,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008.0,"The best way to prepare for me is to choose your words carefully
Thoughts inherently put down, left my therapist needing therapy
Listen, unto you I say verily that I tear your arms standing transparently
Momentarily you won’t know where it be
I run through you like water do
You a part of my imagination so how can you think of hurting me when I thought of you?
You ‘bout to orchestrate a war with fate
My scoring rate soars for hours straight just as sure as 4 and 4 is 8
I read a list of those who scared of this, rhyme experiments are errorless
It’s perilous walking blindly through my edifice
My every thought’s a leap
Acid rhymes dissolved the paper’s lined which made the verse collapse and words fell off the sheet
I’m reinforced with heat that can torch a beat
And scorch an unseen microorganism from across the street
Scholars from other planets be bringing my books
Interplanetary lyrical phantoms be singing my hooks
When you start showing off, I intercept the path you go and cross
Reset money like an NFL referee at the coin toss
No coping with death, you hoping I crack
Man, you so wack that you couldn’t open up for the opening act
I put the pressure on, brother you the worst or the best you’re gone
Unmatchable methods exist in my mentality’s upper echelon
My foes be feeling these murderous abilities
We the realest Gs, I go off just like unpaid utilities
I spill degrees first you reveal with ease, Dope got more tracks than weeds
I breeze through, spit a half a line and kill MCs
Get overzealous when I’m smacking fellers
If it’s life after dead, you ‘bout to find out but too bad you can’t come back to tell us

Step in the ring, it's a KO in the middle
So don’t you ever try to test this man
That’s the founder right there, you either man up or walk off
Man up or walk off, you either man up or walk off
Step in the ring, it's a KO in the middle
So don’t you ever try to test this man
Chains, diamond rings, you either man up or walk off
Leads to your property, ay you either man up or walk off
Stuff like that

My rhymes eat wack emcees up for lunch
And you ain't gotta be Hawaiian to get a punch
A skull and bone crusher, murder emcee perfectly
Aerodynamically, turn back the dust when you challenge me
I’m Dope-E, yeah I’m back with a head full of hair
When I speak these rhymes, they spark and flare, I break an  MC down with a cold stare
You claim you smart but you kill me there
I heard you used up all of your lifelines the first question on Millionaire
And you got it wrong, to tell the truth, ain’t no preparation
No other alternative route, death you facing
I’m Dope-E, you can’t beat me, defeat me
The corner’ll find you wrapped up in plastic like a CD
This ain’t Raekwon but you can call me a Chef
‘Cause I can cook up a Dope-E rapper dagger then slice you to death
Your basketball got stole, I took it
Then fake left and shake back to the right, went back to the left, took it to the middle, penetrated the hole
I radiate raps through your backpack, wear an aerial fitted cap
Pierce the lungs with a scapula and you heard it clap
But your heart collapse, cardiac arrests when I dart at your chest
Dope-E with K-Rino, Hip-hop art at it's best
Your label heard me rap, now your contract is void with a breach
Rhymes tighter than biker shorts on a three hundred pound woman at the beach
To tell the truth, life is a raw game
They think I featured in The Wizard of Oz ‘cause I got control of my straw name
The beat pounces, the frequency bounces
Your newborn baby raps don’t hold no weight measured in ounces
Most emcees be wack like they bite from each other
My rhymes known to play both fingers against the middle, I have y’all fighting each other

Step in the ring, it's a KO in the middle
So don’t you ever try to test this man
That’s Dope E, you either man up or walk off
Any rapper in the UK, you either man up or walk off
Step in the ring, it's a KO in the middle
So don’t you ever try to test this man
America, Africa, you either man up or walk off
Spain, bring it, you either man up or walk off

SPC, from the old school
Twenty years later, in a new school
But it ain’t even all about that
It’s about this now school
Any one of y’all stepping, man
C’mon, bring it
I’m battling for the crib on MTV, higher living
You know what I’m saying?
That’s what’s up, the deed to your land, your property
Any one of y’all wanna bring it
All over the world, bring it, that’s what’s up",https://genius.com/K-rino-man-up-lyrics
Like That,Time Traveler,2006,"Always borrowing your money but they never pay ya back
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
Talk a whole lot of smack but they ain’t gon’ do jack
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’

I’m gettin’ tired of fake people, sick of these artificial
Lying individuals and snitches blowing the whistle
Hollering that they a baller, claiming they block-bleed
Saying they move weight when they done barely seen weed
When they see you in the hood, straight love they try to show ya
Get around some other folks and then they act like they don’t know ya
I ain’t tripping about it, counterfeiting I can spot it
Borrowing paper from you, but when you need it, they ain’t got it
Killing your momentum, now I’m exposin’ ‘em
Fake people, I see through ‘em like panties with holes in ‘em
You’s a child, a baby, just claiming to be wild
Man, you ain’t no real G, you got the Feds on speed dial
Bragging about your women, saying they give ya bread
But every time I see ya, you rolling with hard heads
Boy, you broke, you a step away from being in the red
You ain’t hard, you just recently stopped peeing in the bed

They ain’t never had a fight, talking ‘bout shooting a gat
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
Got a brand new pair of shoes and they don’t know how to act
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’

Now what about these messy females with dirt on they hands?
Tryna give you some advice when they ain’t got no man
Every time you start checkin’ ‘em, they changing the subject
Tryna live like Oprah Winfrey on a dollar store budget
It’s really a shame, man, they trifling game plan
Her kids looking like bums, she dressin’ in name brand
Girl, you ain’t the same person, it’s like you a new lady
Still thinking you fine when you weighing ‘bout 280
Gold digging and  is your main occupation
Rather strip in the club than fill out a application
Still ain’t got no money, still on probation
Yeah you fine, but you need to check your hygiene situation
Let your homegirl live wit’cha, to give her a hand
She stole everything out your house, including your man
Four kids with five baby-daddies, how can that be done?
It’s easy when two of ‘em thinking one child is both of their son

Too lazy to get a job, she making money on her back
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
She don’t let nobody holla ‘less he making paper stacks
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’

Boy, you ain’t no thug, fool, you ain’t no killer
Behind closed doors, you sweet as homemade vanilla
Never been from the hood, you ain’t never came around
Fool, you from a subdivision on the outskirts of town
Some fellas get money, start acting brand new
Others smile in your face, knowing they can’t stand you
Saying they got hands when they never threw a jab
On the metro bragging ‘bout cars they used to have
Saying they went to jail for starting up a little drama
Boy, you lying, you was visiting your grandma all summer
You’s a undercover sissy, computer punk, I told ya
‘cause you love letting boys log on and download ya

Tryna act like you a G when you a down low cat
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
When the fighting was going down, you was hiding in the back
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
Always borrowing your money but they never pay it back
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
Talk a whole lot of smack but they ain’t gon’ do jack
Say it with me, ‘Hell yeah, I know somebody like that’
Yeah

The Non Conformist,Plantation Rebellion,2013.0,"It don’t matter how many times, man, y’all try to hit me with them propositions
Tellin’ me to make them adjustments, tweak this, tweak that
It never happen

Come and ride with me, hang out on that Southside with me
Old school guy spiffy like a Porsche 550
Catch me if you can, haters know you wanna try and get me
Telling lies quickly, saying they got drunk and high with me
Head I should bust it, keep it raw ‘cause the hood love it
Drop a good subject, hope your policy is full coverage
Lame cats try to change facts, them the same rats that end up with they backs laying flat on train tracks
I’m that vet emcee, the pro, you can’t threaten me to go
I got recipes for those who are yet to be exposed
Dude, my specialty is flow, they won’t let me in the door because you best believe they know that I’ll rip seventy in a row
Immeasurable decibel levels that resonate and settle in a septic sick vessel of these ineptical devils
Make 'em sink below, sometimes you gotta shrink to grow, just be sure of what you think you know

I’m the non conformist, the non conformist
Against me the army that you formed is harmless
You got a couple weapons but my guns enormous
You’ll never see the day when my tongue is harnessed
I’m the non conformist, the non conformist
Against me the army that you formed is harmless
You got a couple weapons but my guns enormous
You’ll never see the day when my tongue is harnessed

Just do the work and let the bread find ya
Life is a show, your past and present are the openers, your future is the headliner
The grinders work hard with few off-days
How will you go out, with a standing o or booed off stage?
I’m in this underground deep like Cousteau
They’ll never let a field ni**a like me loose, bro
And I appreciate when some say I’m the greatest though
But I stand way below the ones who came before and made it so
The plot of lynching rap, I’m cognizant of that
How many artists lie through the cracks just tryna get a plaque?
These numbers might not be exact but of the populace that rap
I estimate at minimum seventy-five percent is wack
You need facts and a topic so I load topics with the facts
Most of these cats copy and y’all copying them cats
Drawn to ‘em like a magnet, I thought opposites attract
But it’s obvious they repel ‘cause I’m the opposite of that

I’m the non conformist, the non conformist
Against me the army that you formed is harmless
You got a couple weapons but my guns enormous
You’ll never see the day when my tongue is harnessed
I’m the non conformist, the non conformist
Against me the army that you formed is harmless
You got a couple weapons but my guns enormous
You’ll never see the day when my tongue is harnessed

Time is short, ain’t nobody tryna be losing
The stakes is real high like ribeyes at Houston's
Never will I bow to y’all’s institutions
I’ll probably never get credit for my contributions
If you scared or a sellout then your life is worthless
Got devils tryna tell me how to write my verses
I know he serving his purpose so I keep my game tight
‘cause if the devil mad at me that means I’m doing things right
They might listen to a song and say, “Change that line”
Here’s a couple 100,000, will that change your mind?
You wanted the shiny side but didn’t see the fake in it
The grass was greener but you didn’t see that snake in it
Once you bend over, your career’s a disaster
I’m that runaway slave that came back and murked master
I never change my killer mode, I just fine-tune it
I’ma be me if I don’t sell one damn unit

I’m the non conformist, the non conformist
Against me the army that you formed is harmless
You got a couple weapons but my guns enormous
You’ll never see the day when my tongue is harnessed
I’m the non conformist, the non conformist

All Good Things,Time Traveler,2006,"First case…

All money ain’t good money but when you got it be smart
Somebody said a fool and his money are destined to part
Two cats started out with no paper, came up with a scheme
Hit the streets and started hustling and stacking up green
They gained power and respect in only two quick years
Accumulated strong connections, the streets was theirs
Stayed focused on the business side, respected the hustle
One represented the brains, the other one was the muscle
But bad moves put the whole operation in danger
Bringing women in the mix and doing business with strangers
And guess who it was slipping and supposed to be brains
Violating some of the major principles of the game
His homeboy tried to tell him that he was gettin’ too wild
Showboating and getting addicted to that fast lifestyle
Rule one: when you put in work, never discuss it
Got infiltrated by a female undercover and busted

No matter what you try to do, no matter what you say
Whether people or materials, nothing can stay
In due time, every situation fades away
Understand that all good things will end one day
No matter what you try to do, no matter what you say
Whether people or material, nothing can stay
In due time, every situation fades away
Understand all good things will end one day
Second case…

Been with your man for a year now and you think he the one
Living together five months, even accepted his son
He was working when you met him, doing good with his life
And you could picture being introduced to folks as his wife
But then a side of him you never seen started to show
You found yourself teaching him things a man should already know
He lost his job and started falling off but she didn’t clown
He laid around the house but she steady was holding it down
Now y’all relationship is cursed, you was glad at first
Hoping he’d changed back but things going from bad to worse
Don’t wanna leave him ‘cause you love him and you're comfortable with him
But every other week you gots to call the laws to come get him
Now when she finally let him go, mentally she was done
Judging every man she meet now off the actions of one
Baby, refocus and be patient and God’ll reveal one
View the time you spent with him as preparation for your real one

No matter what you try to do, no matter what you say
Whether people or materials, nothing can stay
In due time, every situation fades away
Understand that all good things will end one day
No matter what you try to do, no matter what you say
Whether people or material, nothing can stay
In due time, every situation fades away
Understand all good things will end one day
Third case…

Mama was down from day one, a real queen on the throne
Gave you life and raised you up until the day you was grown
And even then if you was struggling, she gave you a hand
Instilled every quality in you that made you a man
She was your nurse, your counselor, lifted you when you was down
Even managed to make you hard when daddy wasn’t around
Yeah she spoiled you a little bit but never spared the rod
And was the first one to ever introduce you to God
You didn’t understand that life was too deep to sleep
The most important people in our life we play ‘em for cheap
Until one day, you looked around and mama was gone
And that safety net no longer there to fall back on
You never thought about tomorrow, you just looked at today
Ungrateful for God’s gift, so he took it away
And it was good while it lasted through your life’s endeavor
Whether people, love or money, nothing lasts forever

No matter what you try to do, no matter what you say
Whether people or materials, nothing can stay
In due time, every situation fades away
Understand that all good things will end one day
No matter what you try to do, no matter what you say
Whether people or material, nothing can stay
In due time, every situation fades away
Understand all good things will end one day",https://genius.com/K-rino-all-good-things-lyrics
Long Lost Daddy,The Blood Doctrine,2008.0,"Yeah, another day
Kick back and relax

Every person has a void that needs to be filled
A reason for he or she to live and you'll know it when it's revealed
I took a walk and sat down in the park on a cool day
Relaxing tryna clear my mind and meditate all my stress away
I noticed this individual walking in my directin
I felt a strange connection, he seemed to be a much younger reflection
Of someone that I know well but I thought well
Maybe I'm just tripping but as he came closer and approached my heart fell
He said, 'Excuse me sir, not tryna throw you for a loop
And although you might not have a clue of who I am I think I know you
Would you happen to know a lady named Evelyn
Whose family moved from Arizona to Texas back in the summer of '87
When you was a teenager?' ""Yeah, I know her, I'm admitting that
But what's your point young homie just tell me what you're getting at""
'Well sir, no disrespect and I hate to be a bother
But if the research that I've done's correct then I think that you're my father'

No more staring, where you been all my life
It's been so many years with you by my side
And if I saw you, I'll probably break down and cry
I'd do anything just to make things right, yeah

Look here little man, I'd understand if your daddy stuck you out cold
It was probably hard on your mama in a single parent household
But I'm sorry and I'ma be straight up with you no bad intentions
Me and your momma did mess around but see a child was never mentioned
Well on the cool my mama's married so this might sound crazy
But amazingly my stepdad raised me since I was a baby
And for years my mama made me believe that he had made me
So imagine how I felt to know they had know that they had played and betrayed me
Well let me ask you, what makes you so sure it's me? Well I'll tell you
I found one of my baby pictures in a letter she never mailed you
So seeking you out was something that I needed to do
Here's the note, read it it's true
She was engaged to him but she cheated wiht you
Ooh, and she couldn't reveal to him you wasn't his
'Cause if she did that, that 20 year marriage wouldn't be what it is
Yeah and I love my mama, she raised me well and made me strong minded
But once I knew that a part of my life was missing I had to find it

No more staring, where you been all my life
It's been so many years with you by my side
And if I saw you, I'll probably break down and cry
I'd do anything just to make things right, yeah

I promise you I never knew back then, 'cause when the summer came to an end
She left and I never heard from her again
Did you let them know that you know the truth?
See, news like this could blow the roof off of the whole family especially once you show the proof
Oh yeah, the whole truth came out
See we've been back in town for 7 years and she said this is where you used to hang out
I've been wanting to say these words for weeks
I've been up here 4 or 5 times but see today I finally built the nerve to speak
Well the chance I might not be is what's concerning me the most
The part I can't permantly devote 'til I see paternity resuts
And if it's true, you welcome to come throught and we can do what fathers and sons do
Just know that I'm not tryna get nothing from you
Well that's cool even though you saying that
I know this had to be hard to go through so regardles if it's true I still owe you
I appreciate your understanding and I won't be forgetting this
It's all good, well I gues we need to go handle our business
Let's go

Street Are Callin’,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"Streets are calling and everyday I try to ignore ‘em
I’ve been known to explore ‘em deep from Homestead to 
Going to war is nothing foreign in my forum
From a place where crackheads, blood stains and graffiti is the decorum
Hustle or die, slip up, we cut your supply
Customers buy, keep it business, once you trust ‘em, they lie
Need to accept that evil ways be unable to save me
Why do I choose lust and debauchery over righteousness daily
Can’t be passive ‘cause potential cash amounts to masses
Nonaggressive bastards get swallowed up or laid in the grass with
Lacerations to the throat, repeated shots to the dome
If the streets call me again, tell ‘em K-Rino ain’t home
What’chu wanna be when you grown? Kids ain’t trippin’
The hood’s a college where they majoring in hustling or stripping
Spend a day where I live, you’ll be a believer
Money can’t buy happiness but being broke can’t either

You know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
The streets are calling me
You know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
The streets are calling me

The streets are calling, the streets are calling
Yeah the streets are calling me
And it’s calling out for realness to kill all the fakeness
To kill all the pain that we done went through with the violence and the hurricanes
I try hard to sustain my mental mind-frame
Praying to the Lord everyday to keep me sane
‘cause society seems to be headed for ruin
With all the shootings and the drama but I’ma keep doing what’s right
‘cause life is getting cold, my brothers
And when you loose hope, you’re lost with 
So when times get bad, you better start flexing your muscle
Get your priorities straight and stop falling for the hustle of the
Bling-bling, bling-bling
First you gotta have the means to work hard to get the ching-ching
The streets are calling, the streets are calling
The law is calling me too,  stop stalling

You know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
The streets are calling me
You know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling
The streets are calling me

There’s money in the streets, man, I gotta go get it
Forget a 9-to-5, playboy, I ain’t trippin’
Going dollar for dollar, baby call up the troops
To my real block hustler, here’s a OG salute
I know ya been waiting so let them real rappers in
Some of y’all fake, watch daddy check your chin
Catch me on the , playa, what’chu wanna do?
I’m a solid 220, trick, I’m very hard to move
I ain’t hating on ya boy, but some of y’all soft
Claiming that ya street but never came out the house
I’m a knockout solider, can I get it off my chest?
I hate to be cocky, but I got next
This is my block, baby, I stacks daily
If you think that I’m crazy, f you, pay me
I’m hungry again, the streets better look out
Welcome to the kitchen, don’t get burned, that’s a cookout

You know these streets, they keep calling
Know these streets, they keep calling

The streets are calling me

Never Come Down,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"Y’all need to understand somethin’ about me
I don't never come down
Never come down
Never come down
You suffer from the coward syndrome, run when the trouble comes
My jaw pressure’s bionic, I chew iron like bubble gum
You and your crew pretend to be supermen, I’ll make sure you don’t move again
On a gurney with your ribs protruding through your skin
Amateur scampering in words sampling, I’m the champion
Examining the thoughts of men through a planet-sized camera lens
The plan I execute took Panama’s route
Shoot and leave your outfit redder than a Santa Claus’ suit
I’m the wizard but not that man from Oz
I channel Mars while you pop handlebars and tamper with Hannah Montana dolls
Stomachs split by God’s science
Consciousness leave you and your conglomerates crying
Like retired athletes at press conferences
Fry your thought metropolis quicker than pan sausages
Verses I drop and spit are easy to attract like opposites
My mind is bottomless so tryna follow this is like getting your esophagus to swallow baseball-sized throat lozenges
I’m so cocky that I’m hawking up confidence
Forget a can of whoop-ass, I’ll probably open up a box of apocalypse
My rhyme style’s described as androgynous
Cops say ya to comply with my politics, there's a seventy shot hostages
Compared to you, I’m overly gifted
If I sh*t outside and a horse sh*tted on my sh*t, you wouldn’t be worthy to sniff it
I’ll rout you, pass by you and lighter fluid-douse you and your spose too
Then Heimlich Maneuver a building out you
See your flow made a unethical spectacle
You need a twenty-two gallon metal receptacle to hold one of my testicles
Experimentally extract the best of you
Then dispose of the other 99% that composes the rest of you
From a plane, I tragically hang you
Magically change you into something that’ll actually scare the hell out of Criss Angel
Enemies leave with damaged extremities
And only I breathe the remedies
I’ve lived in eleven high speed infinities
Man, my softest verse will end yo life
Like a ten year old getting punched in the chin cold twice like Kimbo Slice
If you’re fly, have you choking up jewelry
If I ain’t dope enough, sue me, I’ll blast your chest and make you open up to me
Paragraphs I simultaneously release a couple out
In my mouth is a tongue and on that tongue is another mouth
That salivates typhoons, torture is coming soon
The hieroglyphic lyrics written on the walls of the mummy’s tomb
With all due respect, I breathe the heaven breathes
In benevolent degrees that span the diaspora and travel the seven seas
The question is why they tried to bodybag guy
He probably half high, my skills made a polygraph lie
I’ll smack you with a palm of  needles while my tongue releases lethal heat secretions like a bombardier beetle
I’m sharper than ever, each endeavor is thoughtfully clever
You half-steppin’ like a dude with his foot partially severed
You spittin’ raps that lack in potassium
While actually the fact that I’m an immaculate rapper is an axiom
No chance for the dome that I’m blastin’ in
Just like a doctor patching a rifle wound with tape, you malpracticing",https://genius.com/K-rino-never-come-down-lyrics
Ninety-7,Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Ay man, check this out real quick, man I'm a tell y'all something

We got a station in Houston called Ninety-7 nine
But they some pigs so I like to call them Ninety-7 swine
They don't care about nobody long as Ninety-7 shine
They say we supporting local talent, Ninety-7 lying
If I was still in my nineteen Ninety-7 mind
I'd be down to blast at they ass Ninety-7 times
See they probably be up in there sniffing Ninety-7 lines
Pay for spins man? I wouldn't give y'all Ninety-7 dimes
If you in Houston and you still lifting the Ninety-7 fine

Without Love,Intervention (The Big Seven #7),2016.0,"You got a whole lot of bread, bank account is large
Swimming pool in the yard, four car garage
Straight wearing three hundred buck a ounce perfume
Got a two story mansion, can’t count the room
At the club every weekend to show off your ride
Got a woman at the crib, five more on the side
Big chain, big piece sittin’ on yo chest
But every night when you lay down, you’re still depressed
No matter what you amass, no satisfaction
Drugs and wild parties are a pain distraction
Believing in the savior was the main infraction
Problem not the problem it’s a chain reaction
No real friends so you rarely laugh
Everybody who around you is there for cash
Something missing in your life and your spirit is crushed
No love, no hope, no people to trust

Without love, you can be the richest man on earth
None of that means nothing once you enter the dirt
Real friendship is what you need to go for first
Because without love in your life, what is it worth?
Without love, you can be the richest man on earth
None of that mean nothing when you enter the dirt
Real friendship is what you need to go for first
Because without love in your life, what is it worth?

Stealth if it ain’t no peace within it
Happiness can’t be bought, leased or rented
We go through life chasing and clinging to the hope
Now the rich man ended up swinging from a rope
Money bring the worst out of folks, no joke
You had more real friends back when you was broke
Now 24/7 gotta watch your stack
Don’t even know if your own wife got your back
People begging from sundown to sunrise
They got they hand out and they tryna give you five
Chances of them loving you may be slim
They just withdraw from ya like a ATM
Don’t get mad at what I’m telling you or take it as hate
Or seal your fate, try to overcompensate
‘cause being that you never had 
So scratch that nonsense off your bucket list

Without love, you can be the richest man on earth
None of that means nothing once you enter the dirt
Real friendship is what you need to go for first
Because without love in your life, what is it worth?
Without love, you can be the richest man on earth
None of that mean nothing when you enter the dirt
Real friendship is what you need to go for first
Because without love in your life, what is it worth?

Nothing can replace a smile on a face
Or the feeling that you got from life while it was great
Placing things over people is a childish mistake
By the time you try to fix it, reconcile is too late
Stop lying to be great, you should try to embrace
Something special like walking down the aisle with your mate
But you ruthless, like a crocodile in a lake
Nothing authentic about your whole style 
Yet you piling your cake, miles into space
But it’s plenty other people’s hands I’d rather shake
Than the crooked, inebriated and wild 
Who never care, just hung around quietly to take

Without love, you can be the richest man on earth
None of that means nothing once you enter the dirt
Real friendship is what you need to go for first
Because without love in your life, what is it worth?
Without love, you can be the richest man on earth
None of that mean nothing when you enter the dirt
Real friendship is what you need to go for first
Because without love in your life, what is it worth?",https://genius.com/K-rino-without-love-lyrics
Stalkin’,Danger Zone,1995,"I needed cash so I went to River Oaks
A devil made me click at work, so now I lost my job
I'm sick of struggling plus I'm tired of being broke
Pull out the mask so they cannot see me when I rob
I’m kind of nervous ‘cause I never did a jack
I never had to take, I never had to use my gun
But I don’t wanna get no bullet in my back
I need it ‘cause I know the cops will shoot me if I run
I saw my victim, he was at the post machine
Withdrew some money, I would say about a G
Pulled out my strap then I stepped to him like a fiend
Before you know it he was kicking me down with two or three
My hand is shaking ‘cause it’s taking him too long
I know something, he tryna stall me for them loans
I ain’t no sucker I can tell when something’s wrong
I popped him in the chest then I stuffed the money in my draws
Then I’m out

Stalkin' him ‘cause we need another victim
The Devil tried to murder K-Rino but see me tricked him
Checked him, see me say we can’t resurrect him
Pop, pop, laid out and paralyzed is how me left him

In South Park I see my people dropping by the ton
My brothers and my sisters sniffing crack and living fast
Three younger G’s smoking fry, packing a gun
The system said the suckers they don’t want our race to last
You shoot your brother it don’t matter to that cop
You made his job easier, so now you gotta rep
Why don’t you use your hands and let the shooting stop
You need to save your bullets for that Devil when he step
‘Cause he don’t love you, just flip it on the news
You need to get that knowledge of your self and right away
‘Cause if you don’t then boy you know you gonna lose
They put Tyson in that pen and now they tryna get OJ
They came at Red Fox and Michael Jackson quick
They slander Farrakhan ‘cause you know they after him
They tryna make us think our heroes ain’t legit
So when they tear them down the blacks will keep on jacking them
But I’m out


I’m calling up my clique on the south side
From McGregor to the Village strap up, it’s time to take a ride
To Most City and Fifth Ward
You see there’s more of us than cops, if we merge it’s gonna be hard
They way they get us to subliminal
Just because I might be creeping in the lack don’t make me criminal
I got some females in my crew
Understand they ain’t just after the black man, they want you too
‘Cause they get you, they murder masses
The black woman is the tunnel through which civilization passes
Cop fronting like a warrior
But no matter how hard you try to beat death don’t bar ya
I’m out",https://genius.com/K-rino-stalkin-lyrics
Everybody’s Hard,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"See everybody hard ’til the cops show up
A lot of my real hood cats did not grow up
You be watching TV and what the police do
Talkin’ ‘bout what you woulda did if that’a been you
But you ain’t never fall for anything good
You argue with your baby-mama and some dudes in the hood
We protestin’ at the courthouse, wow
Where them hard ass rappers and them gangstas at now?
You scared to get up in the grease
But your granny out there screaming “no justice, no peace”
Won’t even stand with the people that love ya
Oh my bad, I know why, it ain’t no money in it fo’ ya
So who’s really feminine?
You witnessing children and women get hit by the pigs and you standing there filming it
You see the law and won’t cross they path
But you’ll smack a crackhead in the face for a laugh

You make the spot blow up, when your Glocks load up
You be lying talkin’ ‘bout you got the block sowed up
Slangin’ rocks, so what? You ain’t got no nuts
See ‘cause everybody hard ’til the cops show up
You make the spot blow up, when your Glocks load up
You be lying talkin’ ‘bout you got the block sowed up
Slangin’ rocks, so what? You ain’t got no nuts
See ‘cause everybody hard ’til the cops show up

You rolled out, smoking some weed, tryna get in your zone
Cussing people out in traffic ‘cause they takin’ too long
But when them laws jump behind y’all, y’all lowered your tone
Started spraying air freshener and puttin’ seatbelts on
Dude showboatin’ and hypin’ up that negative stuff
But I noticed some people are just selectively tough
They pick and choose when to be crazy and what they gon’ do
But if you really crazy, you gon’ be crazy no matter who, ooh
You be talkin’ like you don’t give a damn
Until the officer pull up, then it’s “yes sir,” “no ma’am”
Change your whole program when they call that unit
Now you standing there looking like a private school student
They might have to chase a couple kids hustling
But I seen boys run when they ain’t even did nothing
Layin’ back ‘cause you don’t wanna foot no drama
You the type to stand there and let ‘em whoop yo mama

You make the spot blow up, when your Glocks load up
You be lying talkin’ ‘bout you got the block sowed up
Slangin’ rocks, so what? You ain’t got no nuts
See ‘cause everybody hard ’til the cops show up
You make the spot blow up, when your Glocks load up
You be lying talkin’ ‘bout you got the block sowed up
Slangin’ rocks, so what? You ain’t got no nuts
See ‘cause everybody hard ’til the cops show up

This is for the cowards, wherever you from
You don’t wanna get involved until they kill yo son
Until they slam yo daughter, you got nothing to say for ‘em
Even then you be ready to forgive and pray for ‘em
No comment for the news, oh Lord
‘cause if yo bossman see it, you gon’ lose yo job
You won’t ride ‘cause you easy to scare
He be like, “Man, I got warrants, I ain’t goin’ down there”
You start talkin’ in your slavery drawl - “If y’all just act right out here, they’ll stop bothering’ y’all”
Boy, shout the hell up, you can’t ride with the goons
Need to take your sissy back inside with the coons
This ain’t the ‘60s where we took all that trash
I’ma choke you with that hose, and I’ma whoop that dog’s ass
I ain’t gon’ lie and say that I’m nonviolent
I notice men turn to boys when they hear them siren

You make the spot blow up, when your Glocks load up
You be lying talkin’ ‘bout you got the block sowed up
Slangin’ rocks, so what? You ain’t got no nuts
See ‘cause everybody hard ’til the cops show up
You make the spot blow up, when your Glocks load up

Peace Thru War,The Hit List,2004,"Say, are you gonna come home with me tonight, baby
Yeah, we could do that, are you ready to go right now
Yeah, but I need to go to my car and get my purse real quick
Come walk with me
What I gotta walk for? I'ma be right here
Come on, just walk with me, it'll just take a second
Aight I'll walk then
What's up man? There ain't no cars around here
*Gunshots*

It's 2:05 in the morning, some fools plotting to hit me
After the club, so it's on when the trigger start to click
Boys came up out their draws, gunning
Gunfire so real that it even had the laws running, follow me
That's when my boy got straight wet up, he wasn't even in it
So they claiming he got set up, he die in half a minute
But the hit ain't go unnoticed man 'cause it just so happened
That his boys were rolling by the club when they started clapping
Hit the parking lot, pistols out, damn man they got him
Saw the girl my boy was with leaving with fools that shot him
Time to pulverize them, kick the door down and surprise them
Cut 'em up so bad their mama ain't gon' recognise them
We born...

We born with much heart so drama we never boss
Sometime's the only way to have peace is through war
Born with much heart so drama we never boss
Sometime's the only way to have peace is through war

It's 3:15 in the morning, somebody at my door
It's my partners, aggravated, cocking up, screaming, ""Let's go!""
They done killed one of the clique, so the shit done hit the fan
But y’all tripping, I can’t ride no more, I’ve got a family, man
“You’s a sell-out motherfucker!” was the words my partner said
“You in here acting like a hoe while our homebody lying dead
Didn’t he have your back that time you got caught up in ‘92
Would he fake out on the crew? Would he get them fools for you?
Hell yeah, well get your ass up, what you waiting on?”
I looked my wife dead in the eyes, kissed my son and I was gone
Riding, contemplating my life, for this game I’m too damn old
But I’m doing what these fools will do to me if I don’t roll
I done resurrected way past the level of a savage
But now I’m in the mood to revisit murderous habits
See the shit or get up of the pot, sign in or sign out
Keep playing the game, the game is over, ain’t no time out

We born with much heart so drama we never boss
Sometime's the only way to have peace is through war
Born with much heart so drama we never boss
Sometime's the only way to have peace is through war

It’s 4:11 in the morning, we at the after hours
Envisioning family members at the florist buying flowers
Cowards automatically falling under my powers
Instantly start to picture bloodbaths from bullet showers
Couldn’t find them killers, got mad,  love
Looked and recognised the same girl from the club
Now it’s on, I know they in the house, I assume
So we followed her sneaky ass into the gambling room
Walked in, mean mugging sharp enough to slice cable
Saw them boys crowded around the dice table
See, PSK was up in the place with Ganksta NIP
When they saw who I was glancing at, they unloaded their clip
And started busting on them suckers, lit ‘em up, one after one killed
10 minutes and four dead men, it was a done deal
And nobody said a word ‘cause they all knew how it started
And the laws don’t give a damn that’s why that shit went unreported

We born with much heart so drama we never boss
Sometime's the only way to have peace is through war
Born with much heart so drama we never boss
Sometime's the only way to have peace is through war",https://genius.com/K-rino-peace-thru-war-lyrics
Wrong For That,Triple Darkness Vol. 1: Wreck Time,2008.0,"Hey, what's up K? Man I hate to even come at you like this bro, but you know the girl done put me out again man. I gotta get this job thang goin on Monday. I just need somewhere to chill for a couple of days man, what's up?

You was broke and almost homeless, didn't have one dime
And lived with every member of your family at least two times
Wore out you welcome everywhere you went you would overextend
Last resort you moved in with your one true friend
In the beginning, it was cool, jobs you tried to pursue
Hitting spots and filling out an application or two
And when you finally got a gig, after a week you was through
You worked a while and quit, talking about it wasn't for you
Running traffic through your boy' crib getting drunk and high
Laying around the house and eating food that you didn't buy
You bumming money from him everyday and using his ride
And any cash you did come across you stashed it aside
The tables turned and you came up, and got on your feet
Your boy fell off and was an inch away from being in the street
After you bled him dry and used him up and did what you do
He came to you, need the same help and you got brand new

Man you was wrong for that, you was wrong for that
On the cool, y'all been kicking it too long for that
I can't believe you that dirty, you're too grown for that
And all the stunts that you pulled homie, they're gonna come back
Fool you was wrong for that, you was wrong for that
On the cool, y'all been kicking too long for that
I can't believe you that low down, you're too grown for that
And all the stunts that you pulled homie, they're gonna come back

Say girl, you was stuck like chuck
Met a hard working young cat that lifted you up
You had a whole lot of ways that he didn't condone
Two children that he helped you raise, like they was his own
He saw through your faults and tried to teach you positive lessons
But you looked at him as a trick instead of a blessing
Denied every girl in town who was after your crown
The first man you ever had that didn't slap you around
He was happy when he found out you was carrying his seed
But your motive was to bleed, do the malice of greed
He did more for your kids, in the months y'all was tight
Than both their real daddies did for them in all of their life
But from the day you had his child, you was causing him trouble
His paper hit a roadblock, and he started to struggle
After he gave the world to you, like a queen on a throne
You put them folks up in his world, broke him and left him alone

Girl you was wrong for that, you was wrong for that
On the cool, y'all been kicking it too long for that
I can't believe you that dirty, you're too grown for that
And all them stunts that you pulled girl, they're gonna come back
You was wrong for that, you was wrong for that
On the cool, y'all been kicking it too long for that
I can't believe you that low down, you're too grown for that
And all them stunts that you pulled girl, they're gonna come back

What eternally makes a person unappreciative?
How you live, the more that you gain the least you give
Women and men who get help from a trusted friend
And then forget the condition that you just was in
After you work hard, they come in and steal your stuff
You can't tear other people down just to build you up
When they struggle, your friendship benefits don't stop
But they act like they never knew you once they get on top
The warning signs of deceit we irresponsibly shun
The move was on purpose, it wasn't subconsciously done
They took your friendship for foolishness, your love for blindness
Took advantage of your heart and disrespected your kindness
They undermine all your hustles to boost their grind
And shoot names to the Feds to reduce their time
This the dude who helped you paper stack and had your back
He in the pen, you laying up with his wife, you wrong for that
Say uh, so uh, how you looking on your situation man?

Man, my sister was supposed to call me and wake me up this morning man. She didn't call 'til like 12:30, you know what I'm sayin? So, after I you know took a shower, and my mama said you know she's gonna give me 2 dollars to catch the bus, but I didn't have no way to get over there to get the 2 dollars. So I was wondering, uuh, can you loan me 2 dollars?!",https://genius.com/K-rino-wrong-for-that-lyrics

Making me stable, teaching me that fatal  blow
Awareness of all in existence what I need to know
We seek to grow in divine light, to shine right
Refine lives, the dumb speak the word the deaf never heard
The blind sight, polytheism, theories and opinions
Exercised by oppressors in the need of exorcism

The five percent poor righteous teachers stand steady posed
Locked and load, set and ready to go
Very close to every host that regulates that higher fire

Breaking ‘em down, God, we getting stronger with time
Intergalactical 1-9 in my rhyme
Heavyweight, these devils wanna cook up a better cake
For me to eat but I ain’t welterweight
Yo check this, the Feds tapping on my Motorola
They say I’m selling that dope without the baking soda
And new 19 galaxy, back on the earth to bless the gods, we
Gotta motivate, each one teach nine at a time
Pagan shooting devils with a noose and a 9
’9-9 ether, take back the land from 6 ether
Murdock the warrior say bring the fever
And I don’t care neither
Bring them devils down to their knees
Turn up the heat to seven hundred and twenty degrees

Supreme mathematics
Yeah, mathematics
Yeah, mathematics

Supreme mathematics
The ignorant hear the truth and they laugh at it
We study God, crafted actual facts, you add graphics
Our wisdom is infinite, your teaching is grafted
We stood on righteous foundations and Allah backed it
Gave him science and math plus knowledge advanced
To lift man from a horizontal to a vertical stance
Our physical is original, created in his image
Your six thousand year existence is a microscopic percentage of the fullness of time
Constantly seeking to find
Allah’s divine sign and the struggle to become one with his mind
Tryna live on every word and take none for granted
We correspond like the sun to planets, you don’t understand it
The distinction of fiction and fact, of hell and heaven
The difference is the devil and God, the 6 and the 7
Trigonometry or calculus, whatever subject cool
One drop can drown whatever they taught you in public school

War Zone,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"Uhuh there they go
It's going down, man
Get ready

Police on every corner, every block, every street
With the number one objective of making us obsolete
Us against them, listen, it’s a massive war
When they wanna regulate us, they just pass a law
The destruction of our young Gs being arranged
If you black or latino, you must be in a gang
You must be a thug, you must sell a whole lot of crack
You ain’t got no home-training, you don’t know how to act
So they ride on the poor folks, joking aside
They said racism is dead, man somebody done lied
Understand you and Tommy can commit the same crime
But when you go to jail, you receive triple the time
Classroom full of ghetto kids tryna excel
But they already know how many going to jail
Had plans to succeed but they falling apart
‘cause they the ones who set it up for us to fall from the start

We in the war zone, it’s gettin’ real in this war zone
No chance to fix America, it’s too far gone
Get your knowledge up, channel your anger
If we don’t come together, all of us are in danger

Research the US government and gathered some facts
All the guns and the crack, the CIA did that
They give you the drugs just for you to sell to your brother
Then give you the guns so that you can murder each other
If you slip in this game, then you go to Hell there
‘cause the last thing they give you is a long jail sentence
This route, most of us know something about
Lock the man up, now the woman’s running the house
Democrat or Republican, which way will you vote?
Either one you might as well put a blade to your throat
When they see you all they see is just a slave from the boat
And the coon on the TV got paid when he spoke
Whole world getting restless, that’s hard to defeat
Country split down the middle, riots all in the street
In the end, none of this will be fit to behold
Economy breaking down, better get you some gold

In the war zone, it’s gettin’ real in this war zone
No chance to fix America, it’s too far gone
Get your knowledge up, channel your anger
If we don’t come together, all of us are in danger

{""United we must stand or divided we fall""}
(Check it out)

It’s getting hard to keep up with all the ones they shot
If we in trouble and we need ‘em to respond, they not
They’ll let you have a few weapons to run they spot
But it’s a plot, you ain’t got the kind of guns they got
It’s hate in their hearts, knowing who you are, they mad
It’s been bad, we done fought in every war they had
Living here for a long time but justice is foreign
In these days, they’ll run up in your house, no warrant
It’s the same way as before, they sick and they rob
Snatch you out your vehicle, dogs sniffing your car
It ain’t nothing for a pig to come steal your life
Being a woman won’t help you, they’ll kill your wife
Chasing integration, you was never part of this nation
The FBI monitored our organizations
Brought us down to square one with no elevation
Now we begging our oppressor to give reparations

In the war zone, it’s gettin’ real in this war zone
No chance to fix America, it’s too far gone
Get your knowledge up, channel your anger
If we don’t come together, all of us are in danger

Metro Fantasy,TheRAPeutic,2013.0,"Ha, uh
It’s such a beautiful feeling
Feeling
Such a beautiful feeling
My metro fantasy
Such a beautiful feeling
Beautiful feeling
Such a beautiful feeling
Watch him
I was riding on a metro bus, writing and you know that
She was at the very front, I’m sittin’ eight rows back
She was looking real nice, face not even made up
I was about to take a nap, but now I’m sittin’ straight up
I couldn’t stop staring at her, might not be another day
Every time she caught me, I would cut my eyes the other way
Did it four or five more times, wait, look, then wait again
This time our eyes connected, uh oh, I done made a grin
Hold up, let me play it cool ‘cause other dudes they tend to nag
Whoa, she looked at me this time, man I got this in the bag
She was reading Art of War, which gave my brain a stronger thrust
Intelligent and beautiful? I wonder why she’s on the bus
She could go get any guy and be treated imperial
But she doesn’t strike me as the type to trip on material things
She was physically poetic, I was slippin’ into the abyss of love
Man, what’s wrong with you?
Oh my bad I’m trippin’
Well anyway, she seems like somebody I hope to meet
Maybe I should move and sit next to her in that open seat
Seems like she might want some company, she’s all alone on here
But I fear that if I come on too strong, she might get the wrong idea
Five minutes later I built the courage to speak blunt
I took a deep breath and started walking towards the front
One step, two steps, what the hell? Now I can’t pursue her
Some other dude got on the bus and sat his ass down right next to her
Ah man, I moved too slow, I guess I learned my lesson
Now I’m looking like a fool, playin’ it off, acting like I’m stretching
Oh well, I guess it’s back to my seat I go
Homeboy said, “Baby, what’s yo name?”
She said, “That you don’t need to know”
Ok, ok, now I’m good ‘cause it’s lookin’ like K is back in the game
But on the other hand, now I’m acting the same
‘cause she shot a dude down just for asking her name
Wait, but his backing was lame
He’s a idiot, she’s got class
It’s not that she’s conceited or stuck up, it’s just that he’s an ass
His approach fell below the type of respect I would show
I should have been off the bus, the driver passed my stop ten miles ago
Well she’s worth it, that’s a fact
Missed my stop, can’t nullify that
I’m way out of pocket, I don’t even recognize this neighborhood
Man, where the hell am I at?
Ok relax, get back focus, dude, you way off track
Better make a move before she reach her stop, after that it’s really a wrap
That’s when something happened that I never did predict to see
She looked at me and started walking my walk inexplicably
Alright, this the moment I been waiting for, it’s ‘bout to happen
I got real excited when she said, “I know you, you be rappin’”
“Yeah that’s me,” wait, but what if she’s thinking that a car I can’t afford
I made excuses, said I catch the bus sometimes when I get bored
She said, “Oh, that’s interesting, may I share this seat with you? I’m almost at my stop so I just had to come and speak to you”
Asked if she could have my number
I said, “Cool as long as you use it”
She said, “Yeah, I need some CDs for my dude, he loves your music”
Oh man, ain’t that about a… it’s all good though, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-metro-fantasy-lyrics
Eighty Minute Eternity Intro,80 Minute Eternity,2012.0,"OK, you guys can be seated
You have all been called here to be part of a study
On the subject of eternity and our place in it and how we can manipulate it
As you should know, eternity is defined as infinite time or duration without beginning or end
What I want to do today is to attempt to show you that
Eternity can be compressed
Into a far less increment of time if properly utilized
I would included not only time as it relates to the future but I will also draw from the present as well as the past
Now many of you may not believe this can be accomplished
But we shall indeed disprove that in this presentation
Now under your chairs you’ll find a headset
With the number 80 inscribed on it
Please place them on your heads at this time
Now what I want you to do now is add the eight and the zero and of course you’ll come up with the number eight which itself represents infinity as its shape is continual in its motion
Thought travels at 24 billion miles per second
This speed will allow us to cover million year intervals
In the time span of an eye blink
Now as the journey starts you will experience a variety of emotions
This trip will be exciting, dangerous at times, adventurous, sad, enlightening, happy, emotional
You will see and hear things from every historic, current and future era
And it will all be done in approximately eighty minutes
Now, do you feel yourself moving?
By now you should feel yourself moving
Can you see it? Can you feel it?
I’m not understanding why you’re not responding
Speak back
Somebody, talk back
Somebody, say something
Uh oh
I think I better get the hell outta here",https://genius.com/K-rino-eighty-minute-eternity-intro-lyrics
Stay Out Mine,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"You on my wood like a termite
My patna said that when you come around, his weed don’t even burn right
It’s looking like I got a wig to split
You telling people what I done before I did the shit
Hold up, patna, chill, a’fighting we gon’ be
You ain’t got your life in line, how you gon’ speak on me?
When they start to talk trash, like handguns I blast
Ain’t got a gal so you dwelling on the ones I smash
Ain’t got a check so you worrying about the ones I cash
You talk fast, fool, your mouth got the runs like ass
Can’t wait to tell, patna, ‘cause you fake as hell
If spreading business was a crime, you’d go straight to jail
South Park, MO City, Fifth Ward, The Third
If y’all know somebody like that, go on and shoot ‘em the bird
And the best way you can recognize a slanderous word
Is if the first thing to leave they mouth is “Guess what I heard?”

Now how come fools always worrying about what’s on your mind?
Talking about me instead of getting up on your grind
I’ma tell you hoes this one more time
You need to get your own business, stay your ass out mine
How come fools always worrying about what’s on your mind?
Talking about me instead of getting up on your grind
I’ma tell you hoes this one more time
You need to get your own business, stay your ass out mine

If the topic is hot, they gossip a lot
It won’t stop with a plot ’til they possibly get profit ya got
Tryna constantly figure out who bed you hopping up out
If you on top they try to drop you down to the opposite spot
You corrupt and shife, too much drama up in your world
But in the meantime, your homeboy running up in your girl
On the bottom is where these haters wanna see K
I know it’s true because you all up in my mix just like a DJ
But you don’t know me, you twenty steps below me
See me hollering at a female, and when I left, he back-doored me
Ain’t like I’m tripping, you was putting cash down
And after all that, she still shot your rotten ass down
You’re talking down on playas tryna survive
When it comes to hating, you put hours in like a 9-to-5
Your old man was just like ya back in ’73 (That’s how it be)
I guess the apple don’t fall far from the tree

Now how come fools always worrying about what’s on your mind?
Talking about me instead of getting up on your grind
I’ma tell you hoes this one more time
You need to get your own business, stay your ass out mine
How come fools always worrying about what’s on your mind?
Talking about me instead of getting up on your grind
I’ma tell you hoes this one more time
You need to get your own business, stay your ass out mine

You know who just went to jail, you know who just got out
You know who smoking, who selling, who shot who and who got shot
You know who snitching, who doing bad, who laying up with who
But it’s funny how nobody don’t know nothing about you

They whole m.o. is to hurt your flow
That’s the reason why they don’t let your ass in church no more
I can’t stand you, that’s why your little freak got ran through
Why is a grown man worrying about what another grown man do?
That shit don’t land you in a unescapable scandal
It catch you up in some heat that your ass can’t handle
And if I die first, I won’t let ya pass
I’ma come back as a foot and kick you dead in your ass
You wanna roll but see I roll harder
And like a bucket with a hole in it, your ass can’t hold water
Get off my nuts, build your name instead
‘cause like a hooper who tore his ACL, your game is dead

Now how come fools always worrying about what’s on your mind?
Talking about me instead of getting up on your grind
I’ma tell you hoes this one more time
You need to get your own business, stay your ass out mine
How come fools always worrying about what’s on your mind?

And a bopper on the passenger side
Everything's alright
Southside got certified hustlers
Northside (yeah) got certified hustlers

If you proud to be from the hood, then throw ya peace sign up
No time for artifical G's, you a soldier line up
My potna just got out of jail, get on the phone and call the crew
We head to his place now for the welcome-back-home-barbeque
Sunday morning, riding down M.L.K. shaking the ground
Passing by the church house, so respect man turn the music down
Pulled up the store, I seen my homie who got paralyzed
He sitting up in a wheelchair now but the blessed is he's still alive
Gave a dap, seen some young homies rapping, I ain't know em (they all good)
They want me on they mixtape man you know I got a 16 for em
Showing love we getting love, I'm happy even when it's rough
My kinfolk got the bust out so we turn around scooped em up
Laws jump behinds us ran our plates hoping to take us down
Everythang on our ride's legit, we had to move around
Met up with the fellas man we just mobbing hard and killing time
Showing love and getting love and beef ain't even on our mind

Creepin' down the block with a pocket full of cash
And a bopper on the passenger side

Showing love to the homies that died
Everything's alright

Forget knowing then what I know now cause that's the past and it's dead
I rather know now what lies up ahead
To many homies doing fed time, counting time, state times
Peace to the ones who got out, tryna walk a straight line
I see my homeboy he's still doing his thang (see ya boy)
I'm down on the court with a good son try'na work on his game
And ain't no rain up in the forecast it's just sunny and hot
And nothing down... they selling Jordans and socks
This neighbourhood ain't been the same man, for as long as I can remember
In H-town, but we still be wearing shorts in December
And much love to the OG's in this H-town rap
Like Big Mello, for putting that... on the map
I drop my lil mama off cause I got buisness to handle
But we goin hook up again tommorow same time, same channel
Southside certified hustlers pimping the game
And I know the players on the northside is doing the same

Creepin' down the block with a pocket full of cash
And a bopper on the passenger side

Look At Me Now,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"Today is the day that we celebrate hood success
This for everybody that said we gon’ be nobody
And made something out of nothing
For everybody who down right now
But you on your way up, you prove the whole world wrong

Look at me now, I’m on top of my game
Through the tropical rains and vipers cock-blocking my change
I done seen so many true Gs get dropped, it’s a shame
So I make sure to keep these haters in my optical range
I stayed on it day and night until my hustle was polished
Got a degree in hoodology, the streets are my college
Love my city but I’m hating all this static I’m peepin’
Every year we lose a legend and these boys are still beefin’
Violating the hood rules, lying and cheating
I ain’t sittin’ on twenty million but I promise I’m eatin’
When it comes to the game, know I got plenty to mash on ya
You can shine but concentrate on realness, it lasts longer
Utilizing my time, nothing going to waste
I can’t get two steps from the finish line and drop out the race
And true to myself is the only way I can stay
‘Cause I ain’t never met nobody that can beat me being K

Look at me now, I done overcame the turbulent weather
They thought that it was over for me but I’m stronger than ever
The longer the time you put in, the longer the cheddar
I wrote a letter, dear haters, thanks for making me better

We gotta get this cash if it’s the last thing that we do
So our people in jail will have something to come home to
And they won’t have to hit the block and start hustling again
And then months after they get out, go right back in
I wake up focused and ready with my mind on my grands
If you hatin’ on me then you got too much time on your hands
Man, I got family in my corner, riding with me, I’m straight
A ounce of love carries more weight than a ton of your hate
Right or wrong, sometimes the weak got to depend on the strong
And jealous people tryna fade me, like the end of a song
And you can come up, but when you fall, it’s rarely a sequel
What’s the use of having cash if you ain’t feeding your people
If you fake, sooner or later you gon’ show yo hand
I’m self-made to the fullest, I don’t owe no man
Except the man above all men who kept me and saved me
I’m thankful for the day Patricia Ann and LV made me

Look at me now, I done overcame the turbulent weather
They thought that it was over for me but I’m stronger than ever
The longer the time you put in, the longer the cheddar
I wrote a letter, dear haters, thanks for making me better

Ain’t no moving to the suburbs, I can’t even see it
The hood put me on my feet so why the hell would I leave it?
We gon’ clean it up and fix it, houses, streets and clothes
I’m from the place where nine out of ten police is hoes
If you ain’t loyal to the game, ain’t no way you can win it
Hustle is like your body, it won’t work if your heart ain’t in it
You gots to be mentally strong or you won’t last long
Some of the coldest Gs that ever lived got talked down on
Get your business hand strong, stack paper by any means
You live with mama but got a ride with new rims and 20 screens
I ain’t trippin’ if you flashy, just keep hustling harder
Ain’t nothing wrong with having things if you get ‘em in proper order
Now, we gettin’ smarter, stackin’ rainy or sunny
Opening businesses throughout the hood with black owned money
And ain’t no more being broke, it’s all real, no graphics
And watching haters in my rearview gettin’ stuck in the traffic

Look at me now, I done overcame the turbulent weather
They thought that it was over for me but I’m stronger than ever
The longer the time you put in, the longer the cheddar
I wrote a letter, dear haters, thanks for making me better",https://genius.com/K-rino-look-at-me-now-lyrics

Brothers coming up but getting laid back down in the gun smoke
Danger, hustlers facing it
Treating that dollar like a trick on the cut and they chasing it
Big time all the way down to the small G's
Twenty brown sacks in the trunk and they’re all Ki's
Murderer agg but he always put his licks clean
Victim 25, trigger man only 16
Slipping, caught him at the spot where he selling it
Bullets to the face so the vest was irrelevant
Little girl playing on the porch, she’s so beautiful
Murdered on the spot, mama crying at the funeral
High capping, showing out, wouldn’t wanna be ya
Jack him at the red light, blow, see ya
Little bots growing up turning into killers
Dope shortage real so they jacking other killers

In this South Park drama, the Park drama
They say, “Yes, me K-Rino the neighbourhood swarmer”

Thinking the police pull me over just so they can try me
Took me downtown ‘cause I didn’t have no ID
Handcuffed, told me I would stay till sixty days up
Made a phone call, in an hour I was raised up
Walked out feeling like a left the plantation
Dope fiends did a drive-by on the station
Big time drug dealer busted by a hater G
Yeah, they locked him up but they didn’t throw away the key
Low so, now it’s right back in the street
Setting up another for the state penitentiary
Guns, in the black hoods you say capture ‘em
How the hell they getting here, we don’t manufacture ‘em
Creeping, bumping like a G with no low down
Powers of a screw makes double ‘cause it’s slow down
Paid, living like a rich man showing it
Money rolling big so they tricking while they blowing it

Kicking the South Park drama, the Park drama

Kicking the South Park drama, the Park drama
They say, “Yes, me K-Rino the neighbourhood swarmer”

I’m on the hoop court, suckers hand checking but I’m drilling them
Tried to start a fight ‘cause them turn-arounds was killing them
Let them jump, I ain’t tripping, there mode is damn tush
Sucker plus static equals Coalition ambush
Cops roll through the park where the brothers drink
Still they got to do it, don’t matter what the others think
Why, pull me over, why don’t you just sit and chill
Cops try to high cap, that’s why they getting killed
Stop!

Start snatching purses
Straight up busted

I got dimensions and dimensions and expansions of dimensions
To nullify your devilish intentions

To defeat a sucker heated, come see it, all opposes are deleted

Translate African hieroglyphics into rhyme state
I’ll leave rappers choking and throwing up food they never ate

To recall what a groupie wants to do to me in all
So I’m swimming in the blues, not many would allude
But I choose to cruise over to Denny’s for some food
To the suite after I eat, I’m thinkin’ sorta deep
So I flip channels ’til I get drowsy and fall asleep but
Part of me is seeking companionship for a treat
Feeling incomplete, this ain’t the way that it oughta be
Now it’s practically agreed, next rap event for me
I’ma actually bring somebody back with me and see
First moment I come across, I’ma get me something soft
Real pretty, sexy and ready, next city it’s jumping off like

Yeah
And I’ma have me a one night stand
And I’ma go tell all my friends
And next time my concert ends
I’ma do it all over again
Might not even know her name
No joke, I ain’t playin’ no games
Kick back, let her do a few things
And that’s what it’s gon’ be, mane

Man, I’m back up on the stage, I’m rapping in a rage
Carefully observing each lady reacting to my ways
As I vehemently spoke, some were being plenty close
But the club is dark plus it’s hard to see ‘em in these locs
So whatever we can detect, I’ma keep it in check
Didn’t even sweat nothing ’til I completed my set
After I hurt the mic, people were purchasing merchandise
Saw a girl I like, right, in a skirt she was working nice
Caught her peeping, clocking me fast, on and popping at last
Problem is it was twenty-two fellas blocking her path
If I don’t get to exchange, I’ma be miserable, mane
So my aim is to keep her within my visual range
Then she came through the crowd, bodies was moving, wow
She said, “Can we get acquainted outside? This music’s loud”
I’m like, “Hell yeah,” I said, “Let’s do it,” and she agreed
“Let’s just try to (*tsk*), you know what, better yet why don’t we leave?”
Told Murder One I’m gone, said “I’ll see you tomorrow”
I just met this girl a minute again, now I’m in her car
So now we at the hotel and I’m nervous on the low
She lookin’ at me, I’m lookin’ at her, so here we go yo

Yeah
And I’ma have me a one night stand
And I’ma go tell all my friends
And next time my concert ends
I’ma do it all over again
Might not even know her name
No joke, I ain’t playin’ no games
Kick back, let her do a few things
And that’s what it’s gon’ be, mane

Now we chillin’ in the room, I’m feelin’ her perfume
I’m assuming it’s gonna be really happening soon
As she sat down on the bed, her hand was on my leg
Know I wasn’t scared but I was wondering in my head
Should I try and make a move, don’t wanna break the rules
Of respect and etiquette, I elected to take it smooth
Now I’m back at level one, should I go a step beyond?
Then she opened up and said this is something she never done
“And though I’m feelin’ ya, man, I’m really just a fan
I came back hoping for a chance just to build and expand”
Then I looked into her face, moved at a slower pace
Brain attraction then replaced fascination below her waist
Chemistry sparking in droves, then deep talkin’ arose
Had hours of stimulation and never took off our clothes
She was beautiful and bright, I knew that this was right
Light coming through the curtains, we been talking through the night like

Yeah
And I’ma have me a one nite stand
And I’ma go tell all my friends
And next time my concert ends
I’ma do it all over again
Might not even know her name
No joke, I ain’t playin’ no games
Kick back, let her do a few things
And that’s what it’s gon’ be, mane",https://genius.com/K-rino-one-nite-stand-lyrics
Intro Flow,Worst Rapper Alive,2005,"Ladies and gentlemen, I’m Hollywood
You’re getting ready to see life how we live it, like we see it
This was from the bottom, Houston, Texas
From the hood to your hood
Pimps, hustlers, money getters, ex-cons and cons
It’s real, it’s real out here

The other day I discovered I wasn’t born from my mother
My daddy strapped up but somehow I developed inside the rubber
Word patterns, I’m holding a uncountable assortment
The first man to put a body inside of a glove compartment
My delivery sticks you with hair-trigger calligraphy wizardry
The flu left my body ‘cause it was sick of me
Challengers don’t wanna hear what I wrote
So get a punchline, I drop rappers by clearing my throat
My pen is messed up, it need to be fixed
It’s been used more times than food stamps by project chicks
Them weak documents you wrote boy, don’t ever submit ‘em
Rappers that died years ago is still afraid I’ma get ‘em
You think you deep, boy? You couldn’t read my mind
If I took some paper and wrote M-y M-i-n-d on each line
Pass me the mic and in twenty minutes time
I’ll beat more raps than Michael Jackson and OJ Simpson combined I hate your freestyle, I wanna pop ya with lead
The only flow you’ll have is blood off the top of your head
Imagine yourself bludgeoned with a car fender
You’ll get drunk inside my sixteen bars ‘cause I’m the bartender
Any phrase you blaze I’m wrecking that
I drop ten too many verses on a 25 second track
They fall while I might check in the beats
Like a car in a collision, you’ll get wrecked in the streets

Take five fingers, fold ‘em and get a fist
Or take one index, squeeze the whole clip
Anything harder than this, name the price on it
You can bet the wager with your money or your life on it
I put my stripes on it, any nigga try and test
Put him on blast like a man tryna wear a dress
Told AC day one I’m a factor
I’m bringing MO City and a bunch of bad actors
Two Ks pointed backwards, but G Rap
We military minded getting money in the trap
B-1 certified OG
And we riding with the three and the SPC

They like, “Yo, man, who is it?”
The Spokesman and The Wizard
Spitting flows as cold as North Pole and in a blizzard

It’s time for Young C-l-i-n-t, the  Spokesman
Got rhymes I’m ready to push like a shaken up Coke can
My music abuses fools who choose to commit the truest
Don’t want any of you to confuse the reason I do this
It’s sixty percent for the love, ten percent for the change
And the other forty percent is for exercising my brain
Leave competitors in hospitals feasting on IVs
What drives me is to know that you niggas don’t like me
You think you can fuck with my rhyme, huh, wanna bet
‘cause I done survived two tracks with The Wizard and ain’t got murdered yet

It’s that chick you niggas love to be with, hate to compete with
Word on the streets these hoes claiming they got beef with
The same bitch when I spit I’m making niggas stumble
‘cause when I step upon the mic, embrace yourselves, hear me rumble
You crumble at the sound of my name
I got these niggas flipping like an acrobat and fiending my flows like ‘caine
Now it’s a shame when I got in this game
You cats underestimated me, now the coldest ni**as in pain
I’m raping their fame, start shit, bitch, better guard your frame
You’re insecure with your career? Shit, then dodge the game
Beware Ms. Trigga ain’t no bitch in my veins
I’m down for whatever, it’s clever  whether I’m addicted to pain

Ayyyy, what?
It’s Infamous Black
A small introduction to the future of rap
A downfall for thirty days and the sound hard facts
Of my pain and my blood, I laid it all to the track, ‘kay
And K say, “Man, you got my back?”
Most definitely, you remember that “Mo’ Gangsta” track?
When we rode on them busters, we ain’t cut ‘em no slack
Matter fact we doubled back with a max for the stacks
Give me that, it’s probably best that you save your 
‘cause when they tied up the gimmicks, your shit sit on the shelf
We keep it moving, nigga, from right to left
Plus we here to kick knowledge like cousin Jeff
So when you see me on the streets, nigga, check yourself
Bow and pay homage to one of the best, nigga",https://genius.com/K-rino-intro-flow-lyrics
All They Gotta Do,Enter The Iron Trap (The Big Seven #3),2016.0,"Damn shame man, damn shame
How easy it is to get us into the spiders web

All they gotta do is give you money
All the dope you want and keep it comin'
Promise you that they would never fail you
And that'll make you do just what they tell you
Let you wear some jewelry and some new clothes
Let you leave the party with a few, woah
Got that Bentley and that yacht and you can use it
As long as you keep makin' stupid music
Long as you don't up and change, you can be they puppet main
You can have any motherfuckin' thing if you don't disrupt the game
Plus they train and pimp your brain, stuck in pain, such a shame
And if you buck or just complain, they'll keep you in touching range
All they do is whore you out, the more they pay, the more you shout
Act a ass is what you're about, bleed you 'til they wore you out
See I don't think you know how sick these people are
Some of ya'll will kill your mama just to be a star

All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do is offer you some cash (What else?)
Offer you some dope (What else?)
Sell your ass a dream but it's really just a rope
Say they'll make you famous, perpetrate like they're your friend
So you played yourself and came away with nothin' in the end (in the end)

All they gotta do is tell you that you
Can get a record deal if you sleep with that dude
Tell you, you look better wearing less clothes
Forget your talent they just want your body exposed
Sadly you don't give a damn long as them checks flow
In the CEO's mansion doin' sex shows
Got you changin' up your body for these crooks to swarm
Implants in your booty now, you look deformed
People lookin' at 'em and laugh at y'all, 'bout to take that classic fall
Walked up in that casting call, showed that man your ass and all
Fell for the lies and the flattery though, stupidity, high, salary, low
Hittin' the club every Saturday, woah, hopin' to land a reality show
See all they got to do is say your face so pretty
And if you do whatever I tell you, we'll take this city
They'll tell you to make a sex tape to increase your grind
They usin' you because you're fine and you don't even mind

All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do is offer you some cash (What else?)
Offer you some dope (What else?)
Sell your ass a dream but it's really just a rope
Say they'll make you famous, perpetrate like they're your friend
So you played yourself and came away with nothin' in the end (in the end)

How come it's so easy for us to be dumb?
How come they make all the bread and we see none?
Intelligence from our essence, why won't we channel that?
They say don't worry about the business part, we'll handle that
Disillusioned by the small amount of cash you made
Actin' paid, you ain't a star, you're just a flashy slave
Got you in-between that rock and that harder spot
Another up and coming artist on the auction block
Do a shot at fame and money mean that much to you?
That to get it is so deep you don't care what you'll do?
They'll remind you who made you if you start misbehavin'
They'll let you talk about the hood, but just don't try to save it
The artistry is watery and what they say is soft
To keep the politicians actin' right, they pay 'em off
If you don't talk how they say talk then they gonna stop your plans
You study talkin' 'bout your brand, what about your fans?

All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do, all they got
All they gotta do, all they gotta do is offer you some cash (What else?)
Offer you some dope (What else?)
Sell your ass a dream but it's really just a rope
Say they'll make you famous, perpetrate like they're your friend
So you played yourself and came away with nothin' in the end (in the end)",https://genius.com/K-rino-all-they-gotta-do-lyrics
Steppin On Toes,Guest Appearances Part 3 (Compilation),2007,"I blaze any block I'm spotted on
My CD is like a rubber, you taking a risk when you ain't got it on
The ambassador mastered the art of committing microphone massacre
Flipping styles like a spatula
I'm hearing doom, I'm speeding near the Moon
.. that stole my rhymes on and still needed room
I disperse lines at the worst time
I got 7 brains so you's a fool if you thinking I'll use my first mind
It's not your fault that I slaughtered you
I put the blame on your old lady for not getting that abortion when she started to",https://genius.com/K-rino-steppin-on-toes-lyrics
Song About Nothin’,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"Rollin’ down MLK, sippin’ on a Gatorade
Slangin’ CDs, stangin' like alcohol on razor blade, taper fade, safe to say
I’ma go back home once the paper’s made
Gotta catch the game when it’s live, no tape delay
I’m gettin’ kinda hungry, I want fish, no steak filet
My TV actin’ funny, oh snap, is my cable paid?
Oh there it go, nothing good on, I guess I’ll break away
‘cause I ain’t watchin’ Fifty Shades of Gray or Rachel Ray
Shout out to my homie J, the radio station played
His new single, now we blowin’ up just like eight grenades
That’s what’s up, that’s why I don’t listen to what these haters say
We be grindin’, they don’t ever work like Labor Day
Solid steel, built up for the long haul, you made of clay
Like MJ in the post, bro, your career’s ‘bout to fade away
Now I’m runnin’ out of words, what’s another phrase to say?
Anything, January, February, March, April, May
My partner called me up, he was like, “Yo, I need a favor, K”
I said “What’s good?” He said he got kicked out and need a place to stay
Let us pray, may the Lord guide you safely day to day
I love you but you’re trifling so with that said, I’m saying nay
Murder told me it’s a block party in the  today
The block packed like the Staples Center when the Lakers play
I rolled through, it was thicker than a ticker tape parade
By the way, you rappers can’t see me like Darth Vader’s face
One day, I’ma slash somebody’s chin with an ice skater blade
I’m just playin’, I needed another line so I just made a way
If you don’t believe something that I’m saying, we can straight debate
Pick a card, any card, you guessed it, ace of spades
Man, you know I’d love to have a slice of lemon cake today
Dude, you ain’t a killer, you just puttin’ on a fake display
On your Facebook page, tryna make a statement like you  with rage
But you ain’t that way
They’ll run up in your place and take your gauge, hey
That lady right there tryna give your homie major play
Remember when our mama’s used to put our clothes on layaway
Used to move in slow mo, now I’m rollin’ at a greater pace
Okay y’all, I’m done, it’s no mo’ info in my database, I’m out",https://genius.com/K-rino-song-about-nothin-lyrics
Respect The Grind,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"Now when we hit the scene, you know we shuts it down
It ain’t no in-between ‘cause we the best around
They try to knock the skill, they try to block the shine
It ain’t no time to hate, homie, respect the grind

Situations in life got me straining
Even though times hard, I’m not complaining
The heat from the haters so hot it’s flaming
But a little sunshine - that’ll stop the raining (Yeah!)
Everybody wonder how K-Rino stay
Three decades with no radio play
See I was around back in ’84 (Hey!)
See my fans - they love me, haters say he ok

Murder One stoke hard when laying up with a beat
Then mic-talk, release sounds to the streets
South Park Coalition, SPC
The pied piper of rap, when I spit, people follow me
The overweight lover because women love me
Street assassin but haters bug me
Murder One as real as they come
Never judge another, no matter where they from

Now when we hit the scene, you know we shuts it down
It ain’t no in-between ‘cause we the best around
They try to knock the skill, they try to block the shine
It ain’t no time to hate, homie, respect the grind

I spend my whole day on rhymes and beats
Lyrics in my head even when I’m tryna sleep
I sneak off when I’m seeking, that’s a blind retreat
Write two or three songs, then it’s time to eat
Some good grub got me feeling on top, still kicking
No more Timmy Chan, I stopped eating chicken
Any track we gripping, you know what it is
So I’ma let my brother Abdul take us to the bridge

My grind don’t stop because my love and passion
I’m all in, never napping or capping
I believe in the faith that God gave me
And still respecting others, my grandfather raised me
Music been in myself since I been a toddler
The person that I am, a leader not a follower
I’m a artist that respect our community
And taking back what they took back during slavery

Now when we hit the scene, you know we shuts it down
It ain’t no in-between ‘cause we the best around
They try to knock the skill, they try to block the shine
It ain’t no time to hate, homie, respect the grind

Nothing wrong if you wanna represent your zone
K-Rino with , Murder went to Jones
If one of me ain’t enough, I’ll invent a clone
Your mentality wasn’t strong so we sent ya home
When I step on the stage, I’m letting you know this
I don’t dance, I don’t shake, I don’t do no splits
I ain’t down with them loud bright colors they wear
And I’ll kill you if you ever try to perm my hair, c’mon",https://genius.com/K-rino-respect-the-grind-lyrics
Dominatin The Game,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"When you ride the Southside, just look up in the sky
Every block you see a K-Rino jersey hanging high
You don’t qualify to stand on the side of me, trick
You ain’t even get drafted, I’m a lottery pick
It’s dead end where they knock boys off for no reason
Led the league in block-bleeding my first five seasons
Still the same building my name since kindergarten
I’m twenty years deep in the game and I’m still starting
Worse than a king, mic-wrecking average is supreme
Every year the hood votes me to the all-star team
I hustle and burn rookies like matches
Bashful you with miraculous street tactics and I never miss practice
True gamers, the police couldn’t even tame us
Me and NIP made bail for them Martin Luther King famous
And I ain’t tryna lose, playing with a scrub
Can’t handle the pressure called timeout and get a sub

I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Dominating the game, I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Steady stackin’ my change
I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Never missing a lick
I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player

Boys wearing they vest, tryna avoid the slugfest
Fake Gs get suspended for failing they thug test
I ride for the cause, never sold out to the laws
I got a lifetime contract with a no-trade clause
K-Rino, the franchise player, was on the cut, black
Way back when some of y’all was still in the nut-sack
I’m clutching the finish pass and I’ll bust in a minute
I gotta get it, the high 90s is my hustle percentage
You gotta grind straight out the womb, no time to late-bloom
You ain’t strong enough, you need to go visit the weight room
Streets a studio, whatever way to get the goods
And cutthroats and snitches get traded to weaker hoods
I weave through opposing defenses with inconspicuous sick articulate emphasis, my stat line’s ridiculous
I call my own plays while you sell-out the most
I’ll do a spree-wheel, get mad and choke the hell out the coach

I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Dominating the game, I’m a hall of fame player

Steady stackin’ my change
I’m a hall of fame player

Hall of fame player
Never missing a lick
I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player

When it comes to grind, I can score a touchdown blind
Against a seven man front with no blockers on my line
You sittin’ at the end of the bench, you never played
You be holding my clipboard and passing me Gatorade
Meantime and in between time be gettin’ paid
Reinvesting and triple flipping every dollar that’s made
The hood know my game, they appreciated my skill
So my ghetto agent renegotiated my deal
I mix three hustles, I can’t do it one way
Strike you out, cross you over and shake you in one play
You should’ve stayed home, safe and undisturbed
I put you on injured reserve soon as you hit the curb
I mash for weeks, straight studying, watch tape
Your paper was late ‘cause you came to camp out of shape
K-Rino, you know me, I’m McGrady plus Kobe
And hopefully they throw me the  MVP trophy

I’m a hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Hall of fame player
Dominating the game, I’m a hall of fame player

Inspiration Interlude,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"Man, you know what? Sometimes, man, we just wanna kick back and hear some inspirational words, man, so use this little interlude as a moment to just get your mind right and recharge your battery I wanna introduce y’all to sister Malaika Phoenix
Get ‘em!

We’ve been here, the hurt’s no secret to this pain
We know where the bodies are buried
We’ve counted the tears and wore the pain of 6,000 years
So well it fits like a second skin
But who, who is counting the dreams, the ideas
The bottled up love and unfulfilled desire to create?
See I know what’s buried inside of you
The treasure just beneath the trauma
We need that, the brightness of Sun, Moon and star-filled hope that pierces memories like orange and pink rays of sunlight at dusk
Like out with the old world and in with the new
The secret if there is one is buried inside of you

Yeah, that’s what I’m talkin’ ‘bout, man
Right about now, man
I wanna introduce y'all to another brilliant sister
She goes by the name of Magnificent

Are you ready? Once upon a time in South Park
5803 South Town is where it started
Undeniable magnificence flowing through my body without divine guidance
In 1997, got baptized in the teachings of Elijah
Now I’m thinking like a god
My purpose is to bring life to my people like a jealous god
We call it the divine grind for unity
Bringing about universal peace, please accept me in peace
I bring good news
Farrakhan is teaching us how to live that Jesus peace in word and in deed
My power has been unleashed
I walk over water calmly because there is no coward that resides in me
I’m absolute with the way that I execute my greatness
My secret is I go to war everyday with my opponent
I will not be defeated by my personal weaknesses
I was born a champion
Being a victim is not an option, failing is not an option
I give it one hundred percent effort to my grind, it’s not an option
Cream always rise to the top and winning is the only option

Beautiful, absolutely beautiful
Ladies and gentlemen
Sister Malaika Phoenix and Miss Magnificent
Now I guess it’s my turn to feed the minds of the people, man
Give ya a little something you can take with ya, let’s get ‘em

Be inspired even when you’re tired
Even when your wires are a little crossed, reconnect them and propel yourself higher
Recapture that fire that was doused by hateful and negative water
Go get your marching orders
And push farther than man’s or self-imposed mental borders
Sorta like working out and becoming exhausted
Just when you think you got nothing more to give, you dig deep and force it
All with the thought of becoming much greater
And that extra grind time ya put in will bring great results later
Yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-inspiration-interlude-lyrics
How Do Ya Know?,No Mercy,1999.0,"How do you know if your man in the wrong?
When you call him and his ex girl answer the phone (Yo)
How do you know if your girl ain’t right
When her baby daddy still be spending the night
How do you know when your man is a mouse?
When you catch him sneaking out of your best friend’s house (Come on)
How do you know if your girl sold out?
When you see a dude driving the car that you bought

You wanna know how you can tell that your girl got smashed
When she say them passion mars on her neck is a rash
Wanna find out if she lying about the things she did?
If she tell you she a virgin but she got 3 kids
Wanna know how to tell if your man is a creeper
If he beep you then he put his beeper number in your beeper
Do you think there’s a chance that he could have a spouse?
Y’all been dating 3 years and never been in his house
Have your woman never told you that she was tired on the phone?
She wanna sleep, you went to her house but she wasn’t home
If you making love to her you’ll experience pain
If she says I love you David but you’re name is Dwayne
You say you let your man drive your homegirl to the store
And they’ve been gone for 7 hours, man you already know
Was it bad enough you saw that dancer licking his neck?
When you caught him after butt naked tricking his check

How do you know if your man in the wrong?
When you call him and his ex girl answer the phone (Come on now)
How do you know if your girl ain’t right
When her baby daddy still be spending the night fool
How do you know when your man is a mouse?
When you catch him sneaking out of your best friend’s house (You feel me)
How do you know if your girl sold out?
When you see a dude driving the car that you bought

You wanna know how to tell if your man is a rat?
If he got a picture of your sister under the mat
Did he say that he was hooping with his boy that the gym?
Then the fool he supposed to be with called you looking for him
Wanna know how to tell man if you getting played?
Is the only time you see your women when you get paid?
If she talking back, cussing, fronting you about some ends?
That means she getting her head pumped up by her messy male friends
Girl you wanna know if you can put your trust in this dude?
Yeah he took you out for dinner but you paid for the food
Met him last night but man I don’t think he got in the tub
‘cause he still got that stamp on his hand from the club
You let your girl go out of town in your brand new Benz
How come she packed her lingerie if it’s just her and her friends?
Do you think that’s your baby fool? If so let me speak
The doctor said she’s 2 months pregnant you just met her last week
Come on

How do you know if your man in the wrong?
When you call him and his ex girl answer the phone (I told you)
How do you know if your girl ain’t right
When her baby daddy still be spending the night (Come on)
How do you know if your man is a mouse?
When you catch him sneaking out of your best friend’s house
How do you know if your girl sold out?
‘Cause you see a dude driving that ride that you bought , fool

How long he mess over you? Let me count the ways
Do he leave the crib and be gone for 3 or 4 days?
Do you work a 9-to-5, whether sunny or rain
While he lay around the crib playing video games?
Have your women cut the love short? If so don’t front
What used to happen every night is now once out the month
Both of them was violating, lying, cheating like Hell
That’s why they caught each other sneaking out the same hotel

Lyricist breaker, life taker, punish a faker
So make another mistake, I'ma run 70 blocks

I got dressed, shot out the door keeping my eyes on the Laws
And I ain't doing nothing wrong but man y'all know how they do
I seen my partner Scarface chilling so I busted a U
He said some boys was looking for me like they wanted confessions
So he ran 'em up out the hood for asking too many questions
I said, ""Good looking out Face"" and then I left to chase dollars
I saw my homegirl at the bus stop and pulled over to say holler
I scooped her up, started rolling, touching up on my mack
I had a clear view in the rear-view of an old school lack
I hadn't noticed but my homegirl did believe it or not
She said that car been following us seen we turned left on Scott
I said, ""OK"", made a quick right with no time to debate
They must have caught on that I'd saw 'em so they kept going straight
Somebody tryna knock me out the frame so now it's a war
These killers cocking up to aim and I don't know who they are

Every time I come around, them haters and them laws try to clown
The perpetrators holler like they down but  bodies getting found
Every time I hit the scene these haters plotting on my dreams
They got me out here acting like a fiend, can't even trust the players on my team

Can't tell me nothing about the Park, I know it inside out
I rode the back streets all the way to old girl's house
Once we pulled up in the driveway she invited me in
Said if you leave right now some heat might get ignited again
I said, ""For sure, I could hang aroud for 5 or 10
But once I think the coast is clear I've got to get in the wind""
I got to figure out who's after me and why these fools is tripping
And how to shut 'em down without me getting caught slipping
She turned on some slow music, started getting undressed
I won't be hitting her unless the rubber's fitting and yes
She said, ""You know how sex feel when you pop an ex pill?""
""It sounds real but I'ma chill, I never have and never will""
I said, ""I could use some water"", so she brought me a glass
After the last sip I was blasted with the room spinning fast
Unconscious and drugged out is not the way that I wanna be
I to an hour later with 5 killers in front of me

Every time I come around, them haters and them laws try to clown
The perpetrators holler like they down but  bodies getting found
Every time I hit the scene these haters plotting on my dreams
They got me out here acting like a fiend, can't even trust the players on my team

My head was messed up, sight blurry, no way I could run
My eyes automatically focused once I witnessed that gun
Still not knowing who these fools was, my anger relentless
Homegirl come out the room and said, ""Sorry K-Rino it's just business""
I wasn't tripping though, I blame myself, that's part of the game
'Cause if the loot was right I probably would have did her the same
They gave her 10 grand for the set up, she counted her bread
Before she could make it to the front door, they blew her brains out her head
He started walking over towards me, laughing pointing his gun
He said, ""Today's your lucky day, I feel like having some fun""
He said, ""If you make it the front door without getting shot
Man, I'll call off this whole murder plot and let you walk out""
Man, I ain't trusting what he telling me but I still got to try
At least I've got a chance to run 'cause either way I'ma die
But the second that I stood up he reached for his waist
As I saw that chrome shine, here come my boy, Scarface
With a whole army of murderers, they mobbed through the door
Within seconds all of those fools were face down on the floor
He said he knew that they was tryna set me up on the low
""I had your back all the while"", ""I appreciate it for sure""

Every time I come around, them haters and them laws try to clown
The perpetrators holler like they down but  bodies getting found
Every time I hit the scene these haters plotting on my dreams
They got me out here acting like a fiend, can't even trust the players on my team",https://genius.com/K-rino-the-set-up-lyrics
Stay Real,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"Life is real simple, lest we make it hard
It’s all about staying real, man
Let’s go

Real, real, real, real, real
Gotta stay real, real, real, real, real
No matter how much I build, I won’t stay still
But gotta stay real, real, real, real, real

I ain’t never gon’ cheat ya, I ain’t never gon’ stab you in the back
I won’t steal nothing from you, I ain’t never got down like that
I got my own set of issues, but I can still take time to help you
I got love for my people, man, but you can still get your face stepped through
Folks tryna get over, instead of workin’ to get on they feet
Tryna be a hood soldier, and got swallowed up on these streets
Some things that I won’t do, no matter how much money they pay
Tryna stunt—that’s the wrong move, I’m from a place where the homies don’t play
All I gotta do is treat a person like you wanna be treated
All that fake sh*t’ll get your ass deleted
Being real is a principle that we needed
Trust me with a secret, I’ll never ever repeat it, c’mon

Real, real, real, real, real
Gotta stay real, real, real, real, real
No matter how much I build, I won’t stay still
But gotta stay real, real, real, real, real

Got people that’ll lie on ya, and sell you out to the police
Some say that they ride or die, but when it’s on they’ll throw you in the grease
I keep myself out of trouble though, ‘cause I’m not tryna do no time
And I don’t want your woman, bro, I got too many problems with mine
I only speak when I’m spoken to, no animosity and no hate
And everything that I hope to do, will get done man and I’ma be straight
I keep my circle real tight, man, I can’t let no new cats in
Disrespect me - that’s a fight man, a twenty-five on a scale of one to ten (keep going)
And if you real, I’ll work with you, if not don’t text, don’t call
I’m too old for the bullsh*t, if it’s out there I’m tryna get it all
I always stay motivated, I gotta make sure the plan works out
And , people gonna hate it, so might as well try to knock they heads off
Understand sometimes I be disappointed, when I see what’s going on these days
I know the world ain’t how we want it, but we can’t get caught up tryna follow they ways
We just gotta stay

Real, real, real, real, real
Gotta stay real, real, real, real, real
No matter how much I build, I won’t stay still
But gotta stay real, real, real, real, real

I can’t fall off, I got a future to build
I’m going all out and I ain’t cuttin’ no deal
Unless it’s righteous I can’t give you a pass
I keep my eyes open, for every snake in the grass, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-stay-real-lyrics
Stop Goin’ In,The S-Project (The 4-Piece #4),2019,"If they treat ya like shit inside the sto’
You don’t need to go in there no mo’
They might smile but I’m tellin’ ya it’s a show
Dummy, they just want your dough
Let’s go, heh

You walk into the corner store, they lookin’ at ya crazy
Same people ownin’ it since you was a baby
You probably spent twenty Gs since you started comin’
But they still watchin’ you like you tryna steal something
They only want your money, in fact they wouldn’t deny
They’ll rush you out the store if you’re taking too long to buy
They’ll sell you bad products that been on the shelf for weeks
And if you argue with ‘em ‘bout it they go and call the police, they
Comin’ to America with dreams to get on top
And right in the black neighborhood is where they set up shop
Then they bleed you and squeeze money out ya ’til ya broke
Put their children through college then get homes in River Oaks
They don’t have no respect for you, the attitude is shameless
They’ll talk about you in ya face ‘cause you don’t know the language
12 o’clock at night, yeah they open, whoa, but not so fast
They won’t even let ya in, you gotta order through the glass

If they treat ya like shit inside the sto’
You don’t need to go in there no mo’
They might smile but I’m tellin’ ya it’s a show
Dummy, they just want your dough
Let’s go, heh

You keep your nails and your feet always lookin’ on point
You like to get ‘em done at that little Korean joint
They keep their face protected so this what I gotta ask
All those fumes in the shop, how come they don’t give you a mask?
They mess your nails up so now it’s ‘bout to get hectic
They flip out because you didn’t shut up and accept it
It turns into a war, tryna get their money out ya
And that’s the day they show ya what they really think about ya
You want weave in bundles, Brazilian, Malaysian hair
They treat you like a dog, but every week you walkin’ straight in there
I don’t care if you get mad at me, dammit, I gots to teach ya
Black lady’s sellin’ the same shit and hers is way cheaper but
You so conditioned it’s hard to picture this ending
Punched the black sista, next day all back in there spendin’
Sold your people out for a discount and that ain’t right
A black business mess up one time and you ban ‘em for life so

If they treat ya like shit inside the sto’
You don’t need to go in there no mo’
They might smile but I’m tellin’ ya it’s a show
Dummy, they just want your dough
Let’s go, heh

The gas stations in the hoods are headquarters for fiends
Watered down gas, cheap food and gamblin’ machines
Bro, I thought you was a Muslim but the hood is sicker
You sellin’ pork skins, cigarettes and strong ass liquor
Every dollar you ever made, jack, we paid that
How many black organizations have you gave back?
All the money that we paid you, millions and more
And you won’t even let me put my poster up in your store
Hell no, time for your hustle to straight go sour
If we show our power, you’ll be out of business in hours
The hood stay loyal, the owners of the stores betray ‘em
It’s like pimpin’, the worse they treat us, the more we pay ‘em
Black people got a problem we need to uncover
We go out our way to hate and criticize each other
But when another man kicks us in the ass, no bother
Matter fact, we bend over more and say kick harder so

If they treat ya like shit inside the sto’
You don’t need to go in there no mo’
They might smile but I’m tellin’ ya it’s a show

Your son is a hoop star but you don’t make it to his games
Your daughter on the Twitter feed, #mydadislame
Coming home from work late, lying ‘bout the overtime
And then you wanna hit her when she find a G to hold it down
It’s been a change in the game plan
Yo baby-mama and yo kids done moved in with yo main man
Caught up in the trap life, tryna be like Meech and them
Don’t worried ‘bout them kids at home, your favorite rapper teachin’ them
The streets done called your name out, you can’t ride through your own hood
The real you done came out, you too fly for your own good
Nobody wanna chill with you, you next in line to catch a slug

You Want Some,Family Bizness (Mixtape),2004.0,"I had to start packing a shotty
'Cause fools was tryna dub my genetic code and sell bootleg copies of my body
I kick facts over hit tracks
And punch the swoll rapper in the stomach so hard his 6 pack was sitting on his back
My Coalition makes 'em assume the position
While I rig his expedition to explode when he turns the ignition
The damages I made were permanent
I shattered the Adam's apple in a battle, they want a steel cage rap tournament, uh
Inmates use my raps for commissary
Man, I was gonna be a pimp but I ain't do it 'cause your momma scary
You out here talking like you done did dirt for years
You couldn’t catch a case if someone threw you 24 beers
We’ll come to your city, spit flows with no pity
You made an ass out of yourself that’s why your style is so shitty
Man, I roll with Knoc Gotti and boy we’ll jump you fast
And I ain’t got to be on MTV to punk your ass


I pick my mic up and I smack the hater
Man, I’m slicker than a condom lubricated with curl activator
I got a strong addiction when it comes to cash
It’s hard to take my mind off it like your girlfriend’s ass
My body unhurtable, my words are like bullets, insertable
I’ll chop the top of your mug and make your head a convertible
Feel it, ain’t nobody out-talking me
I got rid of my own mic, now I’m scared to go outside because it’s stalking me
On the microphone I blow minds and spill your brains over
I come out the dome like football fans when the game’s over
I’ve been watched by the Feds because of the content of my flows
But I seen them bobbing their heads in the back of one of my shows
He’ll get sentenced to Hell if in my face he yell
The trick ran away so fast he tore his ACL
You bragging about your money when I’m knowing you act fraud
You couldn’t make paper if you had 90 trees in your back yard


Never tatted my skin, the way I’d do it is insane
I got a tattoo but people can’t see it, it’s on my brain
I go in a zone known as the man that was born drone
Been in the Rap game so long I got a throwback microphone
I start and I end drama, many fled when I read this
I’m capable of beheading MCs that’s already headless
In my last battle, the victim almost died in it
His ambulance was moving 2 miles an hour because I was driving it
When G’s speak of the hardest MCs, they never mention you
Problems I sent to you, you couldn’t hang if I was lynching you
Huh, I left him quartered, he laughed, I laughed harder
His step-daughter was found slaughtered in bloody bath water
Too late, I flip my mind state and elevate the crime rate
I’m taking MCs out just like a blind date
I’m capping you with rapid rounds while I’m out-rapping you
You said you couldn’t feel me, you’ll feel it when I start slapping you",https://genius.com/K-rino-you-want-some-lyrics
Paper Hound,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"Man, I'm tired of gold diggers so I'll speak on the topic
Judging dudes on what car they drive or what's in their pocket
If you walk up to a female and just tell her hello
They turn they nose and frown up at you like you called them a ho
They look at you like you strange and start playing little games
But if I roll up in a Benz, they whole attitude will changed
They don't want a man they rather have a trick instead
Can't approach unless I got some money glued to my head
I see em at the club, I see em at the mall nine scenes
Like they everywhere man I even see 'em in my dreams
I'm a call it out on sight until I bring it to life
(""Player you mad because she ain't give you enough"") you damn right
But on the real it's the truth cause your survival solution
Ain't nothing but a form of low budget bootleg prostitution
The same baller with the car, the same baller with the cash
Are we the same dude that stump in the mud hole up in yo ass

You a paper hound, fiending for ends
Masturbating off a hundreds, fifty's, twenty's and tens
Chasing money, fame, jewels, shopping sprees, and food
But when it comes to tricking baby I just ain't that dude
You a paper hound, you way out of line
Even when you got your own you still tryna get mine
Chasing money, fame, jewels, shopping sprees and food
But when it comes to tricking baby I just ain't that dude

You walk around like you a virgin, I know what'chu about
So much other dirt in your closet the skeletons moved out
See I know she pack a shovel I ain't tryna to save her
I know she broaching, hell I felt like I was doing her a favour
See I don't mind being a gentleman, and leaning the shoulder
But where I draw the line is when you try'na be to get over
Why go to Papados and spend fifty on all that bull?
We can drop ten at Timmy Chan and both get full
See I was at the Shoppano's buying some chips and a coke
Saw a nice looking female I approached her and spoke
She looked at me like I'm crazy, didn't even reply
I walked away and went and got what I was in there to buy
When it was time to pay for my stuff I pull out a stack
When she saw that she immediately hopped up my sack
Gave me her number told me that she wanted to show me her skills
But what she didn't know that cash was for my rent and my bill

You a paper hound, fiending for ends
Masturbating off a hundreds, fifty's, twenty's and tens
Chasing money, fame, jewels, shopping sprees, and food
But when it comes to tricking baby I just ain't that dude
You a paper hound, you way out of line
Even when you got your own you still tryna get mine
Chasing money, fame, jewels, shopping sprees and food
But when it comes to tricking baby I just ain't that dude

You got the kindness thang for everythang up under the sun
Others feel like if you take em out to dinner they won
Me and K-O we was rolling you ain't think we saw you face
I'm hopping off the bus and walk inside the Welfare place
The only money making scheme of ya own is ya practice
Is when you let somebody else carry ya kids on your taxes
I will sweat you, I'll bet you'll take me straight out if I let you
Pay your bills, take you shopping, slow down damn I just met you!
On the cutting, dissing my car, I can't understand it
As if you use to ride around town in Bentleys and Phantoms
Looking for the truth to handle money like you was the bomb
My daddy grew up with'cha mama now see where you get it from?
I was mobbing with my potna's, and you tried to be one of us
Girl you need to take yo ass to gold-diggers anonymous
Cause it's spreading like a virus, in and out of the hood
They digging sliver tin aluminum brick copper and wood

You a paper hound, fiending for ends
Masturbating off a hundreds, fifty's, twenty's and tens
Chasing money, fame, jewels, shopping sprees, and food
But when it comes to tricking baby I just ain't that dude
You a paper hound, you way out of line
Even when you got your own you still tryna get mine
Chasing money, fame, jewels, shopping sprees and food
But when it comes to tricking baby I just ain't that dude",https://genius.com/K-rino-paper-hound-lyrics
Don’t Like None,The Blood Doctrine,2008,"Yeah, death to the whole police department
Death to the DA, the prosecutor
Can’t forget about the judge
We’d be wrong if we forget about the judge
Every racist jury
Feel the fury

Ain’t no secret, I’m a product of these dangerous streets
H-town, where cash is the only language we speak
Where true gangstas might unleash around them punks
And sometimes whole bodies get found in trunks
You can ride with certain Gs but only trust a few
And police doing more dirt than the hustlers do
We don’t cry when a racist pig’s face is popped
‘cause my circle ain’t got nothing but hate for cops
Actin’ like they serving justice, they can choke that noise
They be the main ones in the city planting dope on boys
Strong arming on the innocent and flashing tools
‘cause most of ‘em used to get bullied or was  in school
They pull you over, any neighborhood you passing through
Snatch you out the car and cuff you to embarrass you
Mess up your whole day and hurt the game when they come through
It takes at least twenty-five of ‘em to arrest one dude

Now when it comes to the police, me don’t like none
They the ones that make me cautious and hold my gun
Anytime them say peace, you know that war might come
And even if you innocent, when them show up, still run
When it comes to the police, me don’t like none
They the ones that make me cautious and hold my gun
Anytime them say peace, you know that war might come
And even if you innocent, when them show up, still run

Police is haters, mad ‘cause they broke with they po’ ass
They get jealous of a young playa that’s makin’ mo’ cash
And pulling mo’ women and gettin’ mo’ shine and mo’ respect
So they envious mind state makes ’em wanna put you in check
Disrespecting grown men and women, quick to push and shove
Roaching for females while doing security at the club
Even if we ain’t doing wrong, they make them step away
Pulling guns, threaten to tase ya and shoot ya with pepper spray
Wanna creep slowly behind me and run my license plate
And if you got a warrant, going to jail will be your fate
And if they catch you with some work, they try to make you clam up
And make you snitch on somebody else ‘cause they got you jammed up
But it’s soldiers in my city who real and won’t squeal
And if they get caught in the mix, ain’t scared to swallow they own pill
But we almost at the time where we can catch one and beat him
And best believe them tricks ain’t never around when you really need ‘em

Now when it comes to the police, me don’t like none
They the ones that make me cautious and hold my gun
Anytime them say peace, you know that war might come
And even if you innocent, when them show up, still run
When it comes to the police, me don’t like none
They the ones that make me cautious and hold my gun
Anytime them say peace, you know that war might come
And even if you innocent, when them show up, still run

If they catch you with some weed, they gon’ confiscate it, smoke it
Grabbed my patna by his neck, slammed him to the ground and broke it
If you got some cash, they gon’ take it, put it in they stack
Try to run, you might end up with fifty bullets in your back
And our innocent young G life just ended today
And the pig that pulled the trigger got suspended with pay, and we
March for a little while and protest for a little while and
Go back to being blind while the wicked officer is smiling
Black ones, white ones, Mexicans and Chinese
I wish I had a bomb to boom they ass up from behind me
Spend they whole day tryna mess somebody’s life up
Clock out the same night, go home and beat his wife up
Now they wanna try to say the streets is outta control
Because a bullet left a hole and emptied out a cop’s soul
And when they see a black man, brown man, they love to stick him
And no justice came to the family of the victim

Now when it comes to the police, me don’t like none
They the ones that make me cautious and hold my gun
Anytime them say peace, you know that war might come
And even if you innocent, when them show up, still run
When it comes to the police, me don’t like none
They the ones that make me cautious and hold my gun
Anytime them say peace, you know that war might come
And even if you innocent, when them show up, still run",https://genius.com/K-rino-dont-like-none-lyrics
Deep,The Other Side (Mixtape),2008,"Hot damn, hot damn...
Hot damn, hot damn...
Deep is when you take yo kids to school you pack yo heat

Deep is when your kids can't play up in the streets
Deep is when you take a shit you still pack yo heat
One eye open, one eye closed when I sleep
That's deep, that's deep
Deep is when your momma can't go to church and eat
Deep is when you take yo kids to school you pack yo heat
One eye open, one eye closed when I sleep

Yeah, the streets had us
Police gladly flashin' they heat at us
We repeat madness for cash to eat, seek an elite status
We breathe money like oxygen, dangerous thoughts pop in
Even with your own bloodline, trust is not an option
We pound the drum, revolution bound to come
You ain't promised to make another trip around the sun
Our neck was on the block, they chopped it
Closed the cell then locked it
'Cause we opted to sell a chemical substance that they conconcted
Now you're divorced from your freedom
With no trusted endorsement
 with the jail and the courts bargain with law enforcement
For a fast lick we blast quick (Yeah)
Your first will be your last lick
Money is mass amounts is orgasmic
Treat hatred, murdered you may get, it's nothing to play with
It's blatant speculation of every woman you lay with
So roofless is the nucleus, harmless and unscrupulous

Come around with ya boy, I'll show you a real talk show

Let's start it off in South Park player, home of the drama
You see that boy right there? He smashin' his homeboy baby mama
If you think she might be pregnant, she is
And that fool that she living with think, he thinking it's his
Now you saying that's his partner baby, not so fast
'Cause there's some player on the North side been killing that ass
And just when they felt like they had the daddy attached
They did a DNA test and neither one of 'em matched
Now let's travel to the projects and check on Mike
He just found out his girlfriend's in love with a dyke
Caught 'em kissing like a motherfucker, what could he say?
So he went and told the truth and let her know he was gay
You see that fine girl right there? You might wanna tip her
Might as well, she just told her new husband she a stripper
There's some throwed off shit, people up to no good
K-Rino my talk show I'm comin' straight up out the hood

Turn off your TV partner, let's go ride
We can witness all that same drama right outside
I'd cancel that bullshit if I could
'Cause it's a 24-hour talk show in the hood

Now let's travel to the white side of the town for a spell
This fool we 'bout to check out, man he's funny as hell
Somebody oughta whip his ass with a windshield wiper
35 years old walking around the house in a diaper
As I flip through the streets bumping tight-ass beats
Look at these redneck racists in these white-ass sheets
I'ma bring it to their head, nothing left to be said
By the time the laws show up, all that shit gon' be red
Now look at this ign'ant bastard over here named Bob
He's feeling great because his woman just gave him a blowjob
Went on to suck her titties, now he's holding her hand
That's when she snatched the wig off and told his ass she a man
Now these fellas out in Riv' Oaks, they tryna slang
Little punk-ass white boys talking ‘bout they in a gang
There's some throwed off shit, people up to no good
K-Rino my talk show, I'm coming straight out the hood

Turn off your TV partner, let's go ride
You can witness all that same drama right outside
I'd cancel that bullshit if I could
'Cause it's a 24-hour talk show in the hood

Ooh man, what the hell is going on
Just look around player, everybody doing wrong
Everywhere I turn, fools getting out of line
Let me give my final thought, drop the beat one time
Ricki Lake is fake, Montel can go to Hell
Fuck a Boot Camp ass Sally Jessy Raphael
Never get no love from me, I stand alone
I wouldn't watch it if Jerry Springer was fucking Jenny Jones
Same old topics, they just take turns using 'em
People mad at folks from the past verbally abusing 'em
Girls getting makeovers and dressing with class
After coming out with couchie cutters all up their ass
You got fights, transvestites, punks and dykes
Golddiggers and tricks, blacks against the whites
Man this ain't on the subject but I'll say it before I leave ya
Fuck Judge Judy 'cause I don't like her ass either

I'm a threat to kick a lyric harder than a heal on a church shoe
Rappers I strangle, they dangle on a flying noose
Open my mouth a let a 20 headed lion loose
Mind blast accelerate time fast
Government banned my poison invisible rhyme gas
19 hours of labour my momma shook out
1 for me, the other 18 to get my book out
I drink quote fluid listen to what I wrote to it
Slam the door in my face, I bet I float through it
See I'ma rip it, ain't no use I'ma fade the wack
I wouldn't give a fuck if Lucifer made the track
My rhyming trigger hella fire when it pulled
Hooked up with MCs and breathe rhymes like pit bulls",https://genius.com/K-rino-se7en-deadly-venoms-lyrics
You Are,Triple Darkness Vol. 2: The Lyrics,2008,"Yeah. This is my dedication to you. I know we don't always live up to what we supposed to be as men, so right now this song that I wrote is my way of apologizing for all the wrong that I did. (Let me) tell you who you really are

(You Are)
The beginning and the end
My ocean, my cool wind
My rock and my best friend
The release when I ache
The icing and the cake
My mental escape
The reason behind every plan I make
(You Are)
The Earthly aid of man
The first living creature manufactured by the Creator's hand
The divine nature user
The righteous principle infuser
The key to eternal life
The god reproducer
(You Are)
The cypher, the circular
The second self of Allah
The provider, the nurturer
Deep dimensions
Beautiful visual images
My energy
The infinite extension of all lineage
(You Are)
Euphoria to my optics
The object of all topics
The mother of all prophets
The African goddess
Infinite and time-tested
Intuitive and eclectic
Love manifested

I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything

(You Are)
The motivation that I need
The wisdom instilled overtime to help man succeed
The strong will, the discipline
The bearer of our pain
The loyal and forgiving
The wearer of our name
(You Are)
The one who rears the child and protects em
With intellect you inject em
You're every color in the spectrum
The Pinnacle
The best of creation, bar none
Brighter than the sun
The well of knowledge I draw from
(You Are)
Life-giving water
The one who managed to make us men in the absence of a father
The one in whom I confide my imperial pride
My perpetual miracle, my spiritual guide
(You Are)
Reprimand when I act up
And when the world tears me down, you build me back up
The feeling I love to catch
Emotionally attached
The wearer of many hats and physically unmatched

I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything

(You Are)
The counselor, the queen
Everything on Earth and in space
The unfathomable dream
Ignite inner excitement with simple chitchat
Whatever I think she is, she's 20 times greater than that
(You Are)
Serious
It ain't wise to play with you
I picture everyday with you
Peace when I lay with you
Feminine narcotics
Hypnotic and sensuous
A vintage Godly image
Individual stimulus
(You Are)
The true definition of heavenly
Who accepted me in all of my error and infidelity
Strength, determination
Focus and dedication
The porthole to the Past
And the future of civilization
(You Are)
Cerebrally orgasmic
The statuesque Queen covered from head to feet in the magic
The one without whom my existence would be worthless
Like the universe being Earthless
You're my drive and my purpose

I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything
I'm so glad that I have you
You have given me everything

Family Bizness,Fear No Evil,2004.0,"This is K-Rino the lung sweller, I'll punish a young feller
Man, I'm so over your head people call me the umbrella
The crowd mover inflict a sharp line quick and do ya
Make you spit up rhymes you bit quick with the Heimlich manoeuvre
Pass the mic, watch a killer star wrecking
Boy, your chances of beating me don't exist like January 32nd
Disasters be automatically where the laughter be
I'm so advanced that time wasn't created 'til after me
Leaving styles pressed on your face like sideburns
Male or female bring 'em on, I split wigs and divide perms
I can face skills that embarrass the hardest rhyme sayers
I'm deep just like  got smashed by 9 players",https://genius.com/K-rino-family-bizness-lyrics
Intro (Annihilation of the Evil Machine),Annihilation of the Evil Machine,2010.0,"Let me tell you
(Tell me what?)
What you are up against
(What am I up against?)
What you think is real is not real at all
We are facing a global system of evil that must be destroyed
These things represent the machine
And hopefully when it’s over you’ll see what I mean
First of all you got government (United Snakes of America)
Corporate America (who steal money on a daily)
Radio (who dumb the people down)
The court systems (who lock us up systematically)
The media, who twist the facts
The educational system (false education) that has failed our youth and bled money
The prisons (or should I say the prison industry, the modern day slave plantations)
(The pharmaceutical companies) the drug traffickers, the real ones, not the little guys you see on the corner, the ones who allow the drugs to enter into the country in the first place
The gun manufacturers, who put weapons in the hands of the inner city youth, in a plan designed to make us kill each other and shed each other’s own blood
The gang members (Which ones?) Not the ones in the hood, the gangs in DC (real gangs) who participate in worldwide gangsterism, who carry out preemptive strikes on countries and try to police the whole world (Did I mention the tea party?)
The preachers, the wicked clergy who deceive the people under the veil of religion
These are the oppressive entities, the powers who systemically control the sleeping masses
Let’s expose ‘em all
First thing we gotta do is gain knowledge of self
Once you gain the knowledge of self and God, the devil can’t destroy you, ’cause if you resist him, he’ll flee, f-l-e-e, ‘cause he’s a flea, a f-l-e-a
C’mon",https://genius.com/K-rino-intro-annihilation-of-the-evil-machine-lyrics

In a vision I had, I saw you preparing. In this quest, I want you to prepare seven albums. You are about to take over the whole rap world. There must be nothing in your way. I would not give you this job if I did not think that you were up for the task, but I know that you are ready. Fulfill your destiny, K-Rino. You are a master. Show ‘em whatcha got

Yeah, you know what? I think I will. I was thinkin’, man. Could anybody do this? I guess they could. But the key is you could write a hundred albums and a hundred more after it but quantity only matters if the quality matches it.

Black Em Out,UnKnown,2016.0,"Yeah, we sleeping outside
But it's time we came to ride for the peope that died
Oh wait I'm meant to say, for the people they killed
Since y'all don't wanna give us , I promise you God will
Then it’s once we said it off, who gon’ stop it
We ain’t gon’ hit you in the face, we gon’ hit you in the pocket
See as long as these witnesses keep killing us dead
We gon’ dry those fools out and stop spending out bread
Listen, nah homie we ain’t here to tear your store up
We posting up, making sure none of our people show up
We mobbing, y’all the one’s stealing and robbing
We done fed everybody but we still here starving
You ain’t feeding us, you bleeding us and leave one stitch
Don’t ever kick your money back for those who made you rich
We built this place from the ground up and worked to the fullest
And only payment that we ever got was ropes and bullets

So what we doing to ‘em this year, we backing them out
Since you think we playing with y’all, we blacking them out
Every major corporation, we blacking them out
Every city across the nation, smacked in the mouth

Understand we for real this time
‘Bout to him ‘em up with something they gon’ feel this time
Al the stores emptied out, the whole scene is clear
You ain’t gon’ catch us fighting over big screens this year
For our power to show we got to build it and grow
It’s truth time, we ain’t lying to our children no more
See, y’all never consider blacks, so this is what triggered that
Racist store owner thinking damn where all the niggers at
Ha, cops killing all the black and brown
The same companies we spend money at backing these clowns
So until they start respecting what we bring to the table
We gon’ cut ‘em off faster than unpaid cable
No Target, no Macy’s, Footlocker, IKEA
No Toys ‘R’ Us, Best Buy, Wal-Mart either
No high expensive clothes, no shoes or socks
Hell, we ain’t even buying nothing out of Jack In The Box

So what we doing to ‘em this year, we backing them out
Since you think we playing with y’all, we blacking them out
Every major corporation, we blacking them out
Every city across the nation, smacked in the mouth

We boycotting full blast, make ‘em hurt for a while
I ain’t never praying for a man that murdered my child
See, the more he got away with it, his arrogance grew
This for the black, brown and Native Americans too
You saying, “Who?” Don’t be acting like what’s happening is new
It’s a pattern for you, so shut you down, we happy to do
No major media coverage and still won’t fail bro
The social media’s the new Underground Railroad
The young soldiers, they wanting it bad
While these scary coons afraid they gon’ make boss mad
We ain’t never seen Santa Claus but if we did
We’ll run him down, jack him up, whoop I’m and split his wig
We won’t ever have nothing if we don't get smart
You wearing $200 shoes but sitting in the dark
It’s time to make out unity become our wealth
What if we circulate them billions among ourselves?

So what we doing to ‘em this year, we backing them out
Since you think we playing with y’all, we blacking them out
Every major corporation, we blacking them out

My People,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"Yeah, big cash, get it quick fast
When we pass, give you whiplash
World full of different types, it’s a mixed bag
Life’ll take you for a ride like Six Flags
Easy to spot with a trained eye
I can’t lie, I’m the same guy
Think so hard it could make the rain cry
Music is medicine, I take it ’til the pain die
As I roll through the city streets
My love for my people runs pretty deep
I stay with ‘em through the high and the low notes
Who I love most: babies and the old folks

Always happy when I see my people, gotta love it
Anytime we come together nothing equal to the feeling
That I get when we united as a unit, can’t nobody hold us back
We never stop, we keep it moving, yeah

We got so many personalities
Different shades, different anatomies
I go from studying the galaxy
To flipping through the H on a Saturday
It’s only truth, I ain’t making a fuss
We the dopest, ain’t nobody as creative as us
All I’m asking is if we so crazy and wild
How come the whole wide world duplicating our style?
We master every field, endeavors of all sorts
Academics and music, don’t even talk about sports
It’s a lot we do daily we take for granted
Not to mention the finest women to walk the planet
That’s why I’m..

Always happy when I see my people, gotta love it
Anytime we come together nothing equal to the feeling
That I get when we united as a unit, can’t nobody hold us back

I know my people gon’ lead the way
I don’t care what nobody say
I know my people gon’ lead the way

Don’t stop, you gotta help the team
Knowledge of self brings self-esteem
You could have you a genius soon
You got a baby on the way, read to it in the womb
Teach ‘em ‘bout God, make ‘em elite
Cultivate their mind, don’t let ‘em eat no meat
Don’t talk baby-talk, say your words complete
Speak intelligently to ‘em anytime you speak
When they grow up, they won’t be scared
Let ‘em know from the jump that the world is theirs
They the ones that I’m proud to see
‘cause we ain’t nothing that they try to make us out to be
That’s why I’m..

Always happy when I see my people, gotta love it
Anytime we come together nothing equal to the feeling
That I get when we united as a unit, can’t nobody hold us back
We never stop, we keep it moving, yeah

I don’t care what it is
Make sure you learn your history and let ‘em know that we invented that
Mathematics, science, all the great philosophies of the world
The pyramids, sports, music, medicine
We did that

Shine,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"I be your number one mob figure
Public enemy to any little sucker who ain’t a friend of me
Sending me vibes of negativity, keep your theory of relativity
I serve The Almighty, you wanna fight me?
Don’t take me lightly
The beast hype me, trash-talking suckas ignite me
Like a gas stove, get that ass drove
If you jump like a grass toad, the brew man, a true man
Super-fly ‘cause I done flew, man
And did shows, knocked hoes and clocked dough
Flipped those, tripped those and kicked doors
I suppose it makes me hard in the eyes of these cats with weak dreams
You know the type that seek fiends
And hoochies in freak jeans who scheme for cream
They all part of the super fiend team, know what I mean?
 baby, achieve baby, forever free
Remember me in your prayers
And we can stack papers in layers
Hit the  live life like a dream
Steady mobbin’ for a mission divine, drop the swine
Bottles of wine, take it easy on the pine and just shine

Stand strong with a positive mind, never let them steal your shine
A lot of people gon’ try to bring you down, ain’t none of them real, they blind
Keep moving full speed, get better, don’t let them kill your mind
Don’t let ‘em take you out of your game, step forward ‘cause it’s your time

Whatever you thinking, don’t think it
Keeping us from shining is like tryna wrap the Sun up in a blanket
Blessings laid out like a banquet
All of my enemies salivating over things that they can’t get
Our status too high to rank it
While you still flanking the neighborhood, tryin’ to hit the same lick
Tryna see more money than a bank hit
But I know that patience is the key, I can’t be overly anxious
The kingdom’s within you, using your mind is essential
It ain’t about material possessions, shining is mental
Capable of doing anything that you can fathom
Sparking ideas equivalent to cracking an atom
The world is waiting on you but you yet to react
The greatness of the Universe, you’re a reflection of that
Young man, young lady, listen, it’s your day
You a walking sun-ray born to light up the way and just shine

Stand strong with a positive mind, never let them steal your shine
A lot of people gon’ try to bring you down, ain’t none of them real, they blind
Keep moving full speed, get better, don’t let them kill your mind
Don’t let ‘em take you out of your game, step forward ‘cause it’s your time

I’m not a preacher-man, but I’ma reach ya, man and teach ya, man
Hot damn, I’m in the streets again
On a mission, F a college tuition
Obey the Quran and be the don
Of the whole wide world, address me that oppress me
But come bless me and your power to arrest in my requesting
To be amongst the ranks of those
Who give thanks to the Lord and shanks to the fraud
It’s odd how hard times and hard-to-find homies combine
Leaving me and mine’s stuck like porcupines
Hit the cuts and go for mine
Get the bucks to show for mine
Now I’m hustling for wealth instead of scuffling for self
Intertwined with like mindsets
Network to increase our net worth, forget the check work
Get the cash and take flight, never shake dice
Obey the rules of life, live right, anytime we gon’ shine

Stand strong with a positive mind, never let them steal your shine
A lot of people gon’ try to bring you down, ain’t none of them real, they blind
Keep moving full speed, get better, don’t let them kill your mind
Don’t let ‘em take you out of your game, step forward ‘cause it’s your time

You the best, you just not knowing
Don’t let nobody block what you got going
See it’s not about talking, it’s about showing
You could be a physicist or drop a hot poem
Prioritize, put life in perspective
The best method to success is working as a collective
Be the star in this movie called life, check it
In the credits, let it say you produced, wrote and directed
Somebody’s words from the past left you affected
Low self-esteem issues within you never corrected
Sometimes good intentions get twisted and misdirected
And every pass you try to throw gets intercepted
Too many shady people try to dim your light
Envious of you because nothing with them goes right
When they start persecuting everything you do
Just remember you the Sun and they revolve around you
Just shine

Stand strong with a positive mind, never let them steal your shine
A lot of people gon’ try to bring you down, ain’t none of them real, they blind
Keep moving full speed, get better, don’t let them kill your mind
Don’t let ‘em take you out of your game, step forward ‘cause it’s your time",https://genius.com/K-rino-shine-lyrics

Gettin’ ready to go to Hawaii, man
How I be gettin’ over there?
Ah you know, I prolly, I prolly drive the Phantom over to, over to Hawaii, man
Hop in the Phantom and drive over to Hawaii, man
Um, I gotta meet this old girl out here, man
I had this situation with the judge in court, man, my baby mama
She pay me 12,000 a month in child support, ya know
I’m cool with the judge, man, so he looked out for me
Oh yeah yeah oh yeah I saw the game last night, man
That boy LeBron gave a shoutout, his post-game interview, man
Ya know, they go back, man, they go back to Cleveland days, man

Boys be lying with laser like timing
Lying ‘bout what they driving and contracts they signing
The videos they made and the women that they laid
And she wasn’t a real model, that’s a stripper that you paid
Do your thing, you ain’t gotta explain it, it’s no need
Talkin’ ‘bout they running keys and they ain’t never sold weed
Said ya did some jail time but your tongue need ripping out
‘Cause you so scary you wouldn’t even send a traffic ticket out
You said you owned the club, now I’ma get ya
You that dude that’s in the back taking them $2 pictures
Of the ladies and the dudes doing jailhouse poses
Selling nasty ass buddha and the plastic ass roses
Said he had a studio, half a million it costed
He got a $100 mic inside his grandmama’s closet
Said he was the headman at a major corporate office
But I saw him getting baskets out the parking lot at Target, man!

Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time

I done heard him tell every single lie that’s in the book
Said he got hands, but every fight he have he getting whooped
Getting stomped out, folded once that impact hit him
Said he goin’ to get some goons and brought his mama back with him
Can’t believe what I saw once I went to his crib
Said them pants was his girlfriend’s, knowing that they his
Lied to your own child, why you gotta be fronting though?
Told him you was on the way to get him, that was five months ago
You tripping bro, plus you a fraud in every way
You say you traveling the world but yet we see you every day
Wearing all that fake jewelry, acting like you was clean
I wasn’t even wearing a chain and my neck turned green
He took a picture at a mansion, that’s just like stealing
Put it online and typed in, ""At the house just chilling""
Lied about your record sales but your game is sloppy
How you go platinum when you only made fifteen copies? I tell ya

Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time
Boys be lyin’
But I ain’t tryna hear that noise this time

Will they tell the truth? I doubt that, they need to get their mouth checked
Said you bought my new project and it ain’t even out yet
What’s your favorite track? (Number 16, that’s my song now)
You a damn lie fool, it ain’t but 15 songs on there
Money money all day, yeah right, he just lied
That brand new ride you saw him in, that was just a test drive
Told me he was ‘bout to go on tour in the morning
I went to a open mic the next night, he was up in there performing
Said he was a player, all the top women he got ‘em
Then he bought some girl he just met a pair of red bottoms
And now it’s time to get you straight like hair with a perm on
Acting like he talkin’ business but that phone ain’t even turned on
It never takes a lot to get the game popping
Let ‘em tell it, they know every celebrity, name-dropping
Five star restaurants, boy you can’t pay that
‘Cause Popeye's is the most expensive place you ever ate at, c’mon

Honest Grind,Funk Out The Bag,2017.0,"It’s alright to pat yourself on the back sometime
That don’t make you arrogant
Sometimes you gotta look at your own accomplishments and see where you came from, ay

You got people that grind, self driven
Doing they best to make a honest living
The kind of people who work and pray even in they troubles
Never done nothing illegal even in they struggle
God-given resources they put to use
Never use growing up broke as an excuse
Standing on they own two, never begging from you
Knowing when it’s time to get it, you do what they gotta do
It’s a challenge, with no fear of facing defeat
Not a day goes by that them children don’t eat
Kept it honest your whole life, no type of deceit
And your reward comes from your Lord when the mission’s complete, come on

If it was easy then everyone would do it
Walking down a bumpy road, it’s natural to stumble through it
(True) and it’s never no need to put a scandal in
A honest grind will get you out of any jam you in

Baby girl, I got to give you your credit
You was faced with a trying situation then met it
Your upbringing didn’t go well, your world was pathetic
The worst things you was ever told, your family said it
Mama regretted having you but you didn’t receive it
You was strong enough and smart enough to never believe it
Got a education and made it despite all the treatment
Raised by evil people whose hearts were harder than cement
And even though it had you grieving and shedding some tears
You was motivated to have you a successful career
And despite the past pain being constant and blatant
You still went back and helped the same ones who was hating
Come on

If it was easy then everyone would do it
Walking down a bumpy road, it’s natural to stumble through it
(True) and it’s never no need to put a scandal in
A honest grind will get you out of any jam you in

It’s such a beautiful blast
When old enemies can put their differences in the past
To forgive, to forgive is getting rougher these days
It ain’t cool for y’all to take that petty stuff to the grave
It’s ugly and played out, we had enough of those ways
And I’m sure this ain’t the kind of cat your mother done raised
If your brother sacrificed for you and covered your A
You gotta show the same kind of love your brother displayed
Seems like loving is so hard but hatred is simple
Holding a grudge causes stress to build up in your temple
It’s all in your head, everything you deal with is mental
Never think the door is closed on you despite what you been through, yeah

If it was easy then everyone would do it
Walking down a bumpy road, it’s natural to stumble through it
(True) and it’s never no need to put a scandal in
A honest grind will get you out of any jam you in

Yeah, ah, yeah, it’s gon' be alright, man

If it was easy then everyone would do it
Walking down a bumpy road, it’s natural to stumble through it

Clear some thangs up real quick, man
Cause I ain't like things to talk from being out here, yeah
Thangs I've be reading
Shows I've been watching
Telling... taking some real haterism
Real haterism
It ain't looking good
Listen, uh

I remember a time, when one coast ran the game
And everybody showed respect to em no matter who came
But the success that they untamed became hard to sustained
And after years of money and fame they relinquished their brain
We supposed them from day one, the east coast was flourishing
Had love for hip hop and paid Amish to it's origins
But when we try to sign with them our dreams got shattered
We got over look and shot down like we didn't matter
So we went independent struggle hard for a minute
Never tripping knowing without them, we wouldn't be in it
We watch the west coast represented to the fullest capacity
Brought a new style dropped classic heat and did it with mastery
All the while we kept racing G, still grinding patiently
Through the hating way to each station the city in the nation see
And now we even good so they instantly hated
But check the history the south is what some of y'all originated

Tell me why y'all getting pissed cause we opening doors
Why you try'na knock our hustle we ain't never knocked yours
We gave love and look how dirty you did us
You need to step ya game up and try to get this bread with us

If be hoofing the mind state of hate is being proven
Jealousy brooming and fools because they units ain't moving
I used to watch Apollo and no matter how good the artist was doing
If they was from the south, nine out of ten the crowd starting booing
They think we have no capacity for intelligent speaking
As if intelligence is only confined the one coast the region
We got artist who are some of the best in the world of nation
But get no consideration based on geographical location
They think it's stupid, but I'll tell you what stupid to me
Judging a whole region off ten guce you've might of seen on TV
Now all of a sudden, hip hop is dead and it's time to rebuild it
Well if it is dead I feel it was hating that killed it
On the radio you say the south is country and slow
But it's all love when you down here try'na make you some doe
Now when they shit is lame, we the ones they tend to blame
And brace the versity that's the main element that extends the game, fool


And I ain't tripping I was raised on east coast hip hop
I was trained by KRS, Chop Game with Tila Roc
We got New Yorkers who buying CD's every one that I had
But since we so simply and dumb lemme give you some math
We grind hard, hit the road, hustle straight blue collar
Y'all are major labels per unit given half of a dollar
So if you went gold you're grossing two hundred and fifty grand
Too pay your managers your lawyer and don't forget Uncle Sam
Every promotional expense that they said you would need
Not to mention parts of the contract that you failed to read
After the video and studio time they recruit
You might touch fifty G's unless yo ass in the group
Now down south our records independently drop
Let's say we move fifty thousand to eighty dollars a pop
Minimum overhead four hundred thousand all our cash
Do the math sometimes we make more instead a less then y'all ass, yeah",https://genius.com/K-rino-knockin-our-hustle-lyrics

Real is the only way that K-Rino can see
Nothin' but love for my Latino family
Bein' divided is what they like us to do
The same enemy that's fightin' us is fightin' them too
What if we took back from those who took from us?
What if we stood  our numbers?
Walk like a real man, nothing can harm me
Stompin' through the city as a conscious army

Live, die, who decides
How much do we have to go through to rise
Doin' what we can to just survive
All we got to do is stay unified",https://genius.com/K-rino-unified-lyrics
How You Wanna Handle This,The Hit List,2004,"How you wanna handle this? Man, we straight bust
About to let these fools know it ain’t no fucking with us

Mess around and pull a move and get your fucking back dirty

I insert words to blood spurt, making your dome hurt
Weak rappers run up to K and get did like homework
Fools attracted to my verses be molesting my style
Fucking my flows they Beyoncé from Destiny’s Child
I got two more murders left, I plan to use fast
One for that rhyme you said, the other for your ass
Inject skill like drug overdoses when I diss ‘em
He ain’t smoke but they still found cocaine up in his system
I’m the last man standing when the right hand’s landing
To get to you I’ll steal a bike and bunny hop the Grand Canyon
I ain’t got to use my brain, you’ll still get swept up
I can outthink most of these rappers with my left nut
Wanna diss K-Rino, your rap career will be a short one
You using your third eye but I’m already on my forth one
The people be running to see me wreck a dumb trick
Like a fast nut when I start them bastards come quick

Verbally I'll execute your crew
Step to K and get that ass beat through
So understand

Who saw my knife sting sharpening, blood you’ll be gargling
What an awful scene when I start to spark a remarkable offering
My thoughts are supreme, cerebrally synchronised like an orchestra team
His mom collapsed while her son coughed blood at the scene
Your girlfriend got a hard diploma, she’s a torrid organ donor
She so strong that she be in a coma with for men on her
My mind’s eye sees a star upon her, universal arising
If you speak one impressive lyric this year it will be surprising
I’ll run around the Earth and prove that I can move at the same foot speed that a turtle do while you sprinting and still circle you
I’ll take it personal and hurt you till I merk you
Bruise you and your whole crew purple and still make it home by curfew
The fast messenger who snatches the cash register
Wearing a mask and a vest and a trench coat then I’ll blast before I question ya
The metal sheet that’s unwrippable, I’ll deliver your child then moments after the miracle I’ll strangle you with the umbilical

If you only knew the type of pain that I'll put you through
Verbally I'll execute your crew
Step to K and get that ass beat through

You battling me is like a fucking wino tryna guard LeBron
I got a text message from your mom and this is crazy
It said, “K-Rino, please take it easy on my baby”
Nope! You wanted me now you got me, so let’s be clear
That I will be ____ to knock that ass down when I leave from here
Now that we’ve got it straight there’s no debate so kill the hate
I’ll eat you alive and save you remnants for my homie Late
Put my hand down your throat and pull you inside out
So I can see inside your mind to see what you all about
For every scar MCs that come to battle
Put a bolt in your head knock and run to cattle
They see my face, shout “Lace coming!” and then they run
Poke you in the chest, it’s like being shot with a gun
Just for fun I dangle MC’s from blocks of flats
Call me MC Rent-a-Kill ‘cause I take out rats

Are you always constipated?
Do you have problems taking a dump?
Do you eat two or three times a day but only sit on the pot twice a week?
If so, you’re in pretty bad shape, buddy
Eat to live, not to die

You know that’s real
The mo’ bad food you eat the worse you feel
All that pork and that other straight nonsense you straight ate it
Constipated from years of old food accumulated
Now the waste you didn’t pass made your intestines swell up
Bacteria forms and parasites developed
Messed up, mentally and physically all sick
Suffering 24/7, about to fall quick
But, we got a product that will clean out your system

I'm through talkin', so say what you gotta say, boy


There's twelve devils on the jury, and me on the stand
I'ma try to pull a move up in this bitch if I can
K-Rino the aggravated mercenary MC
Picture seven loaded weapons and six aimin' at me
But them hoes ain't got the water 'cause I'm jackin' the boat
'Cause the one that was remaining, it was here in my coat
If I bust 'em I could make it if they lock me up tight
Watch my spirit leave the jail and kill a ho every night
I got partners in the county, a couple in the pen
Two or three I know I ain't gon never see again
But it's cool 'cause I understand the days and the time
They'll release the body but incarcerate the mind
But the mind gains knowledge, knowledge it design

Drown myself in wisdom just to keep me in line
But after thinking I'm alive, motherfuckers still dying
So, who gon be the killer? Who gon be the weak?
Who gettin' kicked off in they ass right now as we speak?
Each second I'll be moving hyperspeed so I'll laugh
'Cause every million fuckin' years you move a inch and a half

Some be havin' knowledge, some thinkin' the worst
Niggers think hood gods conquer the universe
A mind like a killer, got nuts like a squirrel
You ain't gotta go to jail, 'cause you're trapped in the world


Come and see, look at me the gravedigger
Programmed to punish the ingorant enslaved nigga
Pissed-off, unstoppable, fully equipped clicker
 colors infused on a jugular, ripped quicker
K-Rino the wrecker, attacks unrelenting
Fuck every president from Washington to Clinton
If I meet a mother fucker and I think he a hater
I whoop his ass off the top to keep from doing it later
See I gotta check the head, then resurrect the dead
Hit the spot and check the lead, Edgar Lee collect the bread
Aight, it ain't no coming back from drama in flight
Higher level lyrics I write to free my people overnight

Some be havin' hope, some thinkin' the worst
Niggers think hood gods conquer the universe

Z.I.N.,Welcome to Life (The Big Seven #6),2016.0,"Love you, brother
Thinking ‘bout the homie Z.I.N., the person that you was
And knowing you had this track, we gon’ rep it for you
Come on, uh

Man, what would Z.I.N. do on this track?
Probably spit some facts, make it blend smooth
Then use some deep wisdom to help us improve
Maybe drop a little knowledge or spit what he been through
DJ, producer and sick with a pen too
Jack of all trades, mentally sharp as a Ginsu
True-to-the-heart brother as sure as the wind blew
Hit the stage with a band and rip up a venue
He could be the artist or play the manager role
First met you at  when we was at damage control
Then you got your own show, still playing our music though
Used to come to Third Ward and rock at your studio
Lot of greats came through the door every other day
Worked with ‘em all from Dead Prez to Brother J
Can’t forget your positive spirit and plus I like to say
What you did for the people can never be wiped away, c’mon

Z, I to the N
Z, I to the N
Z, I to the N
I’ma let the people see why you a friend

Every genre, facet, man you was a magnate
Nobody had a problem being pulled into your dragnet
Community strategist, champion, catalyst
Frontline activist, bigger than some rapping sh..
All about the action, not into that cheap talk
Last time I saw you, you was out at the peace walk
Always shedding light so we wouldn’t be lost
And show nothing but love any time that we crossed
Tired of , still doing what was necessary
Legacy set ‘cause you was a real visionary
Job done ‘cause you carried the torch you was meant to carry
Your work is eternal even though your flesh was temporary
Down with ya ’til the end, that’s the man that we know
Everyday we pray Allah bless your family, bro
All Real Radio, ain’t no breaking them ties
Shoutout to everybody that’s keeping the station alive, listen

Z, I to the N
Z, I to the N
Z, I to the N
I’ma let the people see why you a friend

When I think about the homie, can’t lie, it’s sorta sad
Can’t speak for everybody but I never saw him mad
Glad to know that you was on our team in this fight
Every dream in your sight, you would work to bring it to light
One of the few that really knew what unity means
Picking up trash, keeping the community clean
You was rare ‘cause most of these other rappers be scared
One of the few artists in the city who actually cared
The loss is still real, hard for people to handle
I learned something every time I heard you speak on the panel
Can’t believe you ain’t around no more, but then again
But we gon’ always rep for Z.I.N., c’mon

Z, I to the N

Ask No Questions,Guest Appearances Part 1 (Compilation),2007,"Ask no questions, I'll tell no lies
My opponents getting weaker once they look in my eyes
Mesmorize 'em with these tight lines I instantly chose
Killer flows rendering my foes instantly froze


I come like hard wind, a hundred miles a hour or greater
Automatic rhyme regulator, rip through snakes and torturin' haters
Fool got out of line and started gun-bumpin' and shit
Laws showed up laughin' at him sayin' ""That's what he gits!""
K-Rino sendin' heat rays and bustin' up fades
Sharp rhymes, sucker swallowed and left him shittin' out blades
Connecting and resurrecting, infecting the population
Collecting and paper checking, one punch I could drop a nation



In this rhyme race you can't win, so don't even try
You might get fourth place, right behind me myself and I
It's too easy for my Year 2000 flows to uproot ya
So freeze me and thaw me out a hundred years in the future
Ignorant rappers I fling, with the stylin' I bring
While Philero's gettin' wicked on a violin string

Why don't you ask me when he wake up and his ass stop burnin'?


DBX, why don't tell these fakers how I go down?

All About My Paper,Ten Year Run (1993-2003)  (Compilation),2003,"I hit the streets with about 50 CDs inside a box
And work the same cuts as a hustler tryna move 50 rocks
I watch crack go for 10, so I don't have to think twice
And they fiend for mine too so I sell 'em at the same price
Hustlers support me and best believe that I support them back
With words that elevate them up out of the game, I taught them that
Installing my ways, spreading knowledge so they won't fall in the maze
Balling for days, the ghetto quarterback calling the plays
The Laws roll up but they fly like birds do
'cause when you ask to see some ID, I'ma ask for yours too
Then continue and chase that hot dollar 'cause I want it
And I wouldn't give a damn if Charles Manson face was on it
Understand

Understand that I'm all about my paper
Situations about to make me pull a caper
Let it be known I'm always paper chasing
Violate us and a mob is what your facing

I change my name to Dictionary 'cause I rip so many words
They call my partner Middle Finger 'cause he flip so many birds
And he ain't never been to jail but it's only a matter of time
Before the ladder you climb play out and the court system shatter your mind
Fought with my wicked side and let it rise above me
Lay my battles on a prayer rug and let Allah fight it 'em for me
Seen him transfer from a boss into a stool pigeon
Now you're spending years living in prison tryna find religion, uh
Your game was stale, many tried many failed
25 with an L, then he died in his cell
He got a grip of paper, not a penny spent, he in jail
Should have quit, but 1 time too many was when he went to the well
I went broke and got a 9-to-5, had to try
Somebody said, ""You got a CD out, why you working?"" ""'Cause you ain't buying""
2 tracking but still stacking, accumulating wealth
And these units gon' move if I got to buy 'em up myself
So understand

Understand that I'm all about my paper
Situations about to make me pull a caper
Let it be known I'm always paper chasing
Violate us and a mob is what your facing

If you front me 10 G's I'ma bring you 20 back
That's what I told my homeboy who was slinging plenty crack
He said it ain't no thing I'll drop a 100 in your lap
Man, if I touch that kind of loot, then I ain't eat much scholar rap
I just make some good investments, I advise you to do the same
This  to the flame, he said I wasn't true to the game
He said I guess you right because I'm not true the system got you
He waited until I got through, he said, ""You pumping but what about ""
You making music, every year you come out with something new
But every take you drop, you need somebody to invest money in you
So you claim I'm getting set up, what you claim might be true
But if the system pimping me then it's pimping your ass too
Mine is legal though homeboy, you see I'm using the skill in my dome
I chilling at home, I ain't on the cut killing my own
He said, ""To each his own"" and fires up a joint
We agreed to disagree but still agreed on one point
And what was that?

Where The Love At,Makin’ Enemies,2015.0,"See, we put a lot of work in this, man
So all we ask is that if you feelin’ it, show us some love

I wrote this for every artist, in every city and market
Especially independents who have it hardest
From the first day we started, we learned the game hands-on
Every part of it, and that helped us to be the smartest
Each song in our arsenal carefully thought, written and recorded
And with our own finances we parted
Our hopes for radio play were thwarted
And all that hard work we put forward was blatantly disregarded
I always been curious ever since I became a lyricist
Why the people around you don’t take you serious
See y’all don’t understand the kind of character
It takes to jump in a van with product and cover a whole area
You hand people a flyer, they just stare at ya
‘cause all they know is what they see and hear plastered through mainstream America
But see they not the only ones I’m speaking of though
Because half of the time it’s usually the people you know so

So where the love at? That’s all I wanna know
Ain’t gotta look for it, if it’s real, it’s gonna show
The truest ride forever, fly-by-nights come and go
So never perpetrate like you rocking with me ‘cause I’ma know

If I meet another liar, I’ma probably lose it
How you my number one fan and ain’t bought none of my music?
Some people ask why I’m not bigger, best way to describe ‘em
Is you know me and you not buyin’, you part of the problem
In the microcosm, their thoughts are all out of sorts
They have to see you blow up first to validate their support
They say they with me but I don’t believe ‘em
I seen ‘em buy plenty CDs from other people then they ask me for a free one
Didn’t go to my show when it was 10 at the door
But paid two fifty to see that commercial cat front row
And it’s not a issue of envy or hate to let you know
Just don’t tell me that you with me unless it’s actually so
I give one thousand percent to feed you well when I murder tracks
Where is the love? I’m like Donny and Roberta Flack
But through it all, I still eat and I will not fall
And shoutout to my real supporters, I ain’t forgot y’all

So where the love at? That’s all I wanna know
Ain’t gotta look for it, if it’s real, it’s gonna show
The truest ride forever, fly-by-nights come and go
So never perpetrate like you rocking with me ‘cause I’ma know

You wonder why a lot of good artists didn’t succeed
Either he didn’t work hard or his people didn’t believe
Hung around hittin’ the weed while you did all the liftin’
Or they said they was with him but their actions show something different
Ask ‘em for some help grinding in the streets, no luck
But tell ‘em you shootin’ a video, they all show up
Gave everything he had tryna strive hard
Now real talent to cats working on nine-to-five jobs
To rap or sing and do it for the world is your dream
But when your family don’t support, that’s a discouraging thing
It ain’t always bad business that causes ‘em to be gone quick
A lot of cats’ careers was killed by they own clique
But let me tell you artists on another note
Some of y’all just too lazy to get out and promote
And you won’t even grind for yourself, homie that’s tragic
Then you sit around wondering why your album went plastic, now

So where the love at? That’s all I wanna know
Ain’t gotta look for it, if it’s real, it’s gonna show
The truest ride forever, fly-by-nights come and go
So never perpetrate like you rocking with me ‘cause I’ma know",https://genius.com/K-rino-where-the-love-at-lyrics

South Park Original
South Park Original
Yay
I’m a South Park Original, geographically intrinsical
Deadly as Demerol, contemptuous lyrical timber wolf
Born in the darkness, then raised among the heartless
Started this journey inside the Esperanza Apartments
And even as a young cat, you knew you had to be cautious
And after a while you learned how to stomach all the rawness
Long before the crack epidemic ever set in
That’s the part of the hood that was known as the dead end
I wasn’t gettin’ in no trouble, I was a little fella
Saw some stuff that woulda shocked my mama, so I didn’t tell her
A firm look was the best warning
Went to bed for the night, right back outside the next morning
And what you don’t know can hurt us
My grandmother used to sell cool cups, candy and hamburgers
Riding skateboards and ten speeds then we
Moved twice, MLK and Griggs back to Salinsky
It got real around ’84
See I was one year in with the pen, turnin’ into K-Rino
See I remember Sterling Talent Show
I was supposed to win but my mic went off, they sabotaged me, bro
Peace to my school, I don’t remember names
But I remember killin’ rappers and makin’ records with Tim and James
That’s where I gathered up all my game
I’d be the first one inducted if they had a South Park Hall of Fame
Back in the days we played every sport
I done rolled down every street and shot ball on every court
I wear my badge on my right shoulder
Wish we had a graffiti wall with the names of every fallen soldier
I seen every legend start rappin’
Heard a lot of clappin’, seen a lot of money transactions happen
I earned respect like a soldier should
And I can still ride and walk the streets because I never sold out the hood
Yeah
South Park Original
I’m a South Park Original
Aye, let me do some shoutouts
Shoutout to the SPC
Shoutout to every gangster young and old who still here or gone, free or on lock
Every rapper that ever made it, ever made it from the hood
Every athlete
Even the ones that don’t come back and help the hood no mo’, still shout y’all out
Every school, middle school, elementary school
All the queens
All the kings
And everything in between
It’s love

My homie got  burning for a dollar a piece
That’s a nine dollar profit quick fast
Go get that cash
Ran a truck in a jewelry store window with guerrilla plans
Had to see it with my hands, worth over hundred grand
Not bad for a smash-and-
Go get that cash
18 wheeler in the hood, stolen goods
Ran labels from Sony, Bose and Kenwood
Get it while it here, hot and dash
Go get that cash

And I ain’t asked to be born in a world where money is god
So I eat you before I starve
You saying fuck my babies when you won’t give me a job
And you know the economy is fucked up and times is hard
So I’m digging in the crack of your ass
Go get that cash
I’m in your town on your corner in front the  store
With DVDs, CDs and more
So go in your stash before my beanie turn into a mask
Go get that cash
Mama gotta get it how she live
She strip, suck, take long hard dick, push dope and babysit kids
Plus graduated at the top of her class
Go get that cash

Is there a honor ‘mong thieves? Not in Babylon

Prostitution, money-laundering and drug-trafficking
Make a stack and then start over and flip it back again
Being broke is like living in hell
And boys even got newborn babies for sale
We done seen, we done pulled every possible caper
Small licks like selling food stamps for paper
From the city where they jack quick and hustle the best
Where they’ll snatch your birthday money off of your chest
And it’s a bum on every corner, a trick in every scene
A hustler on every block with a fist full of green
Gotta add to your stash when them ones get lonely
Tryna get it how ya can, I ain’t mad at ya homie
Walking down, looking on the ground, tryna find some

Waste Man,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"What’s up, K-Rino, it’s your boy, Late
You know that man you see on the street
Who’s begging for something or is wanting for something?
Out here in the UK, we call him waste man

He’s a waste man, waste of time, waste of space
All he wants to do is just get off his face
He’ll do it any way that he can
Even rob his mother ‘cause he’s a waste man

You a trifling waste man, you a disgrace, man
You been sitting on your can for a twenty year straight span
You gets no respect or love from preachers or the thugs
And the crazy part about it is you ain’t even on drugs
You a waste of conversation and breath with no concern
For nobody but you, you even a waste of sperm
Your contribution to the world equals nothing at all
Your old man shoulda jacked off and shot you on the wall
You be looking for a handout, searching for sympathy
Exhausted your resources, now you tryna empty me
Your motivation and drive is at a minimum
It’ll take you ten years to be equivalent to a bum
Your own kids are ashamed of you, dead in they eyes
It’s so bad now you starting to believe in your own lies
Your whole life is blackmail and hustling and extortions
They oughta pass a law legalizing grown man abortions

He’s a waste man, waste of time, waste of space
All he wants to do is just get off his face
He’ll do it any way that he can
Even rob his mother ‘cause he’s a waste man

He’s a waste man, wasted his education
He’s the guy you see hanging ‘round the bus station
Says he needs bus fare but it’s for the drink
He’ll rob you blind quicker than you can blink
He’s never got a cigarette but wants to smoke yours
He smells of sweat, mouth full of cold sores
Forty years old, five kids he never sees
It’s always, ‘Can you lend me? I’ll pay you back, please’
He’s a waste man, money goes up in smoke
Holds in a pipe, saying it’s his last toke
He’ll never quit, he’s a natural born user
Alcoholic boozer, substance abuser, loser
You avoid him when you see him
I’m tryna tell the youth you don’t wanna be him
It’s easy to slip when things don’t go to plan
Next minute you know, you’re the waste man

He’s a waste man, waste of time, waste of space
All he wants to do is just get off his face
He’ll do it any way that he can
Even rob his mother ‘cause he’s a waste man",https://genius.com/K-rino-waste-man-lyrics
Shellz In My Shotgun,Family Bizness (Mixtape),2004.0,"I’m laying in the fielding, itching from the grass
From a thousand feet away shooting fleas off a bulls ass
Where I’m from, triggers pull fast
A mask naked, it don’t stop me busting in a warm ass
I’ma take what you give me, man
And be the first motherfucker in the hood that wore 
Come and see the dismantled ones
From the city where the kids teach their parents how to handle guns
We ain’t even gon’ discuss that
It’s scarier than a motherfucker in my house, the roaches bust back
Trust that, I ain’t playing man
I’m about to blast a courthouse, are you coming or you staying, man?
They out here tryna break my thought cycle
Your life will end ‘cause I’m a disciple of death with an assault rifle
K-Rino busting up your show
With a three pack of lifestyles ",https://genius.com/K-rino-shellz-in-my-shotgun-lyrics
Hit Um Up,Guest Appearances Part 3 (Compilation),2007.0,"You wanted war, well partner you just started one
You talking all that shit knowing that you scared to shoot a water gun
Shots that have you jumping like you've gotta piss
You was hard, now you begging me to leave your family out of this
Fuck that, I blast with a mask, murder their ass quick
Then bury 3 or 4 motherfuckers in one casket
Fools tallle-telling like children
This boy sucker snitched then died and still told the laws who killed him
Like the Earth they quake, for what's it worth they fake
I'm blowing motherfuckers out like a birthday cake
Tryna con your girlfriend and put her down 'cause you trust her
But she the one who told us where you live, motherfucker
You wanna know how I knew you followed me, I had somebody follow you
Feed you bullets just like Akro, opened up and swallowed you
K-Rino, yeah I got a mob but I don't need 'em
Fool, I got a clique of roaches that will do you if I feed 'em",https://genius.com/K-rino-hit-um-up-lyrics
Driving Away,The Hit List,2004,"Man, I know everybody done been through this, you know what I’m saying?
Male to everything man
You tryna holler at somebody but they ain’t the one driving
‘cause the driver wanna burn off ‘cause ain’t nobody talking to them
That’s straight hating, man

I’m tryna holler at you but what can I say
When your hating ass friend keeps driving away
I’m tryna holler at you but I can’t get no play
‘Cause your hating ass friend keeps driving away

It was 10 o’clock that night, I was rolling down the slab
Checking out the scene, tryna see what I could stab
I pulled up at the red light, can’t believe my eyes
Rolled down the window and started telling lies
The conversation’s good but the lights about to change
Ain’t no cars behind us so I keep running game
See, she’s the passenger, her friend was at the wheel gripping
My partner’s next to be but for some reason he ain't tripping
I see the driver mean mugging, man she out of luck
“What’s your number, boo?” Green light, what the fuck?
I know this girl ain’t drove off but damn my night is ruined
Her girl was even looking like, “Girl, what the hell is you doing?”
But they was in a Jaguar, I was in a Nova
Tryna chase their ass, the damn laws pulled us over
I never got that phone number, K-Rino was done
The only three I heard her holler out was 731

I’m tryna holler at you but what can I say
When your hating ass friend keeps driving away
I’m tryna holler at you but I can’t get no play
‘Cause your hating ass friend keeps driving away",https://genius.com/K-rino-driving-away-lyrics
You Know U Love,Triple Darkness Vol. 3: Coalition Ambush,UnKnown,"Yeah, we roll-calling today, man, we got the whole South Park Coalition in the studio, but we finna hit y’all with this three headed monster real fast, DBX, Texas Tech, and of course your boy, c’mon

You pay the price when I start slicing
I keep mics in trouble
Like they was Vic, Jackson or Tyson
My thought devices well over lyricists like bison
Rapping need to be like driving a car, you need a license
My style is so unorthodox
It left the last biter throwing up blood clots and coughing rocks
Ripping the world in half was my greatest scam
On the mic I get in your ass like a prostate exam
The vocal vampire who settle the rebel camps
The restraints supposed to be champs with belts and metal clamps
You holding a microphone is dangerous enough for me
Like a baby being placed in a dope fiend’s custody
DBX and Tech, we coming through goat-roping
Pressure bust a pipe but this pipe will bust your head open
You’re claiming words that ain’t yours so who’s the real father?
The DNA came back, you are not the author

You know you love them niggas that still rip it
The skills kicking, them lyricists spitting them tight flows
You know you love them niggas with high spirits that bring it to you so vivid and show you how life goes
You know you love them niggas to get off
‘cause SPC, damn nigga, it’s real talk
You know you love them niggas, them making niggas move around so move around while you can still walk

This for my niggas that still rip it
Exquisite lyrics from niggas that get it how they live it
I train mics to roll over and do tricks
I’m sick, I’m telling you sober when dude spit
Competitors prepare with shield and battle armor
When DBX stand mic in hand 
You rappers are all bums, I wonder where y’all from
If we wanted bitches and hoes, we’da called some
You bustas see me it’s panic and pandemonium
Like in Hong Kong with Godzilla standing over them
The game cursed me, I’m hungry and bloodthirsty
It never eases so pray to Jesus, he love mercy
But as for me, I finale with a catastrophe
Face fatality when you feel the wrath of me
You fools can’t out-rhyme me, I flow like a tsunami
Drown your clan in this bitch, now tell your mommy

You know you love them niggas that still rip it
The skills kicking, them lyricists spitting them tight flows
You know you love them niggas with high spirits that bring it to you so vivid and show you how life goes
You know you love them niggas to get off
‘cause SPC, damn nigga, it’s real talk
You know you love them niggas, them making niggas move around so move around while you can still walk

Texas Tech, uh oh, mash mode, best let the clips reload
Gutter made blade flows dethroning all you hoes, I suppose
It’ll never be real ’til it’s real
’til real motherfucking skills pay the bills and get all the deals and still
I’ma clink up and grind ’til it stand
And be the first to let it shine while I piss on a man, understand?
I’ma rock this motherfucker to sleep
‘cause when it comes to mics and pussy, they suffer defeat
Nigga , I’m confident with kicking my own ass
For wasting my time putting up with your trash ass fast as
You niggas hit the dirt, get work
 still played it, lyric legend, lyricists flirt
Assert my murder tactic with a hatchet and vocal
Summon spirits to match it, just to show that I’m local but vocal
When it comes to this game, I’m not a lacker
Murder by name, call me the insane rhyme-backer

You know you love them niggas that still rip it
The skills kicking, them lyricists spitting them tight flows
You know you love them niggas with high spirits that bring it to you so vivid and show you how life goes
You know you love them niggas to get off
‘cause SPC, damn nigga, it’s real talk
You know you love them niggas, them making niggas move around so move around while you can still walk",https://genius.com/K-rino-you-know-u-love-lyrics

I say hold up, Mudrer One, no need to click until I say blast
Fuck the radio, fuck George Bush, and fuck  with his gay ass
Y'all ain't paid no mind to us, straight bomb no time to fuss
Turn that wack-ass rhyme to dust, automatic artillery designed to bust
My versatile arsenal consists of an uncounterable weapon
See I'm a bomb, and you just a slingshot
Your whole clique vowed to never lose a battle I vowed
Got seven females pregnant at a show when I jacked off in the crowd
See this is somethin' for you haters to come and get

Boom, don't take your life for granted
Put my brain in outer space, it could pass for another planet
Black book, black book, black book, black book
Black book, black mother fuckin book, boom
I override inspiration and write rhymes
Comes from sleepwalking in the Park naked at nighttime
Lunatics wonder why I'm hard as a lead rock
How I choke three or four necks with one headlock
I blow January through May til the moon bursts
Five months dead, now Near Year's is on June 1st
K-Rino, I heat it up til your crew is fried
Blew his pride, rocked him til the mic commits suicide
Inside my brain, it rains and rains
Constant flow of ice cream and milk in my veins, yo
You talk shit I get like E.F. Hutton

Give Um What They Want,Guest Appearances Part 3 (Compilation),2007,"They wanted murder so I had to get him
His homeboys was tryna help him now they laying with him
A round of ammo let him know we wasn’t playing with him
Roll up and unloading, my motive was to spray and hit him
So feel that

They wanted murder so I gotta splat him
I stuff a verse inside a can and then I shot it at him
I drew the line but he got out of line and he overstepped it
His body still behind that garbage can right where I left it
I bumped you off with 80 weapons, 80 murder visions
They had to draw his chalk line in 80 different positions
My lyrics blew him up to pieces ‘cause my powers greater
His body dropped but then his mug landed 4 hours later
Even as a youngster my style was  and raw, rougher than Brillo
The Tooth Fairy used leave rhymes and rubbers under my pillow
My thought elements travel beyond human intelligence
I swap words with birds and teach herds of wild elephants
10 doses of cement mix entered your colon and made 10 bricks
That ruptured the structure of his appendix
And dripped toxins in it for 2 hours and 20 minutes
And left a big hole that went whheerrr when the wind hits
In this rap game I stay elite
You wanna see me make five rappers vomit, play a beat
Murders discrete and  undertakers throats get infected and rots when it’s complete
The only thing harder than my rhymes is your old lady’s feet

They wanted murder so I had to get him
His homeboys was tryna help him now they laying with him
A round of ammo let him know we wasn’t playing with him
Roll up and unloading, my motive was to spray and hit him

Tellin on Em,UnKnown,2018.0,"Make no mistake we don’t hate we are the victims of it
Hatred next to love, if it’s your choice hatred gets picked above it
You know all we want is justice, that’s how come you trick the public
‘Cause it’s something you don’t want to give us so you switch the subject
Well we might as well go ahead and make you madder since your mad
You lied and made a protest about the flag cause your intentions bad
Since you wanna mention flags ok yeah let’s mention flags
Same ones you lynch black people under with your lynching Ass
Stand for what? Y’all let the military implement that trash
The NFL did that for the cash, bastards pimp the flag
Salute minister Farrakhan, he showed us the flag code
It’s disrespect to lay it flat or even wear it as clothes
Every move made is to put us behind those steel bars
Shady media misleading you about the real cause
Check the reconstruction era, then go look up Jim Crow
Black poverty was planned but you’ll never hear that from them though
So give us faulty education, oppress us, deny us jobs
Then act like you don’t know why we broke, hungry and why we rob
You just tryna fill them prisons up and max out the volume
Crime at the top is the reason for crime at the bottom
Every mass murder occurrence you tag a Muslim with it
Till you find out a gun packing militia Christian did it
Pissed off at the government and thought that was the right step
Or flipped and shot a college campus up because his wife left
These damn savages like death, what they do is irreparable
So how come everybody is a terrorist except for you?
Chemicals in damn near everything we drink and eat up
They now you love weed so they amping the THC up
And I ain’t even got to Trump, you saying this man is human?
Who the hell you foolin’ your staff look like a klan reunion
Take it how you choose but voting won’t get us out of this
And you’s a damn fool if you think our ancestors died for this
This is what the coons and the racists can’t stomach
They cringe from it, I can already see the comments
They know the facts but they deflect it and start fights
Following Tommi Lauren’s stupid ass and the alt right
But who’s the real life slaughterers of our culture?
The vultures responsible for the massacre in Tulsa
Independence we had it, but a short time it lasted
And I’m still flashing back to Emit Teals’ open casket
Your mad cause they don’t acknowledge your right for open carrying
That’s only ‘cause you running around thinking you an American
Double standards disparaging, your governments are crooks for certain
Draft dodging president he lied and said his foot was hurting
Always got a blanket to cover him up when he(‘s) exposed
And
The heats coming, you can’t fight them flames
You so conditioned now you actually like them chains
Zionists using their powers to influence the whole
Scary black organizations under Jewish control
False flagging, just to see how people respond
You wanna murder black students give those teachers a gun
Won’t be long ‘till the universal mystery’s straight
Lies take the place of truth now and histories hate

Old School Rippin,Speed of Thought (UK Compilation),2009,"Bust at your feet till you lay with red socks
Im so aggravated that my chest hair is in dreadlocks
You should think giving me a pen filled with ink is kinda like giving Superman an energy drink
I prevail I'm a beast when it comes to mail, I work harder than a crackhead whose fresh outta jail
Step to you and tear your head off with one hard quote and show up to your mommas house in nothing but a trenchcoat
Im known for writing a verse and spitting well and im hard to get rid of like a chitlin smell
Oh my gosh man I think Ive had enough of your trash, I'ma giant you an insect on a buffalo's ass
You couldn't beat me with a bullwhip, with the foot speed of flash and a 39 yard head start in a 40 yard dash
My prime lasted 25 years and still wrecking, your prime lasted 4 minutes and 32 seconds
Your album is just like welfare don't you get it, there's a lot of people on it but they're ashamed to admit it
I use the mic for methods of battery beat your from sunday to 'saturdee', you so trash that your insults flatter me
I'm baffled by your lyrical tactics, I'm amazed at you manage to  maintain that consistent level of whackness
With little concentration and practice, I spin the planet on my finger like a globetrotter, like it was on its axis
Natural skill no dope, I never popped a pill, got banned from therapy sessions for slapping Dr. Phil
Broke in your crib knocked your gold teeth out and pawned them, fool you couldn't roll on me if you was a condom
Being conceited got you defeated, he tryna act like he a pimp, his game is so weak his blow up doll cheated
Bit my rhymes I ain't get mad I know you need it, I put hair on it so it will look familiar when you eat it
The masses in the building they don't need to search, I put lyrics in the collection plate in my church
25 trillion is probably what I'm worth, fuck a Bentley I'ma put a down payment on the Earth
I blew his head off left nothing but hot vapor, I was tryna see if his brain matched my wallpaper
The hospital said he was ultimate patient, I hit a lot of times like multiplication
Like water glass I just had waste him, he was running I was standing in place and I still chased him
When I pounce that's the end of the game, I make you hate that I'm on ya like that tattoo of your baby momma's name",https://genius.com/K-rino-old-school-rippin-lyrics
