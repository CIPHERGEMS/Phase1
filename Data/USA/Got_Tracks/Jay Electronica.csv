Exhibit C,Victory,2009.0,"Hey!
It's coming
Ladies and gentlemen; this time around
The revolution will not be televised
Woo! As we proceed!
To give you what you need!
'09, mother—!
Get live, mother—!
Ladies and gentlemen of the court
In the hearing against The State of Hip-Hop vs. Jay Electronica
I present: Exhibit C

When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York niggas was calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang (Oh!)
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of an angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames (Oh!)
Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains (Woo!)
I ain't believe it then; nigga, I was homeless (Uh huh)
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' weed on the corners
Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona
'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a nigga and informed him:
""You either build or destroy, where you come from?""
""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""
""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"" (Ooh!)
Question Fourteen, Muslim Lesson Two:
Dip-dive-uh, civilize a eighty-five-uh
I make the devil hit his knees and say the ""Our Father""
Abracadabra, you rocking with the true and living
Shout out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot (Oh!)
Where niggas really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb
At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, ""What's up?"" (Buh!)
Kill a nigga, rob a nigga, take a nigga, bust up
That's why when you talk the tough talk, I never feel you
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin' off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya (We need somethin' realer! Ooh!)

Nas hit me up on the phone, said ""What you waitin' on?""
Tip hit me up with a tweet, said, ""What you waitin' on?""
Diddy send a text every hour on the dot saying
""When you gon drop that verse? Nigga, you taking long""
So now I'm back spittin' that heat, could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin' Adidas out on Hollis Ave
That FOI, Marcus Garvey, Nikky Tesla
I shock you like an eel, electric feel, Jay Electra
Oh my God! Keep going!

They call me Jay Electronica—fuck that
Call me Jay Elec-Hanukkah, Jay Elec-Yarmulke
Jay Elect-Ramadan, Muhammad as-salaam-alaikum
RasoulAllah Subhanahu wa ta'ala through your monitor (Ooh!)
My Uzi still weigh a ton; check the barometer
I'm hotter than the motherfucking sun; check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My mama told me, ""Never throw a stone and hide your hand""
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black, and then devise a plan
Out in London, smoking, vibing while I ride the tram
Giving out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And—by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin' out at Tweetstock, building by the millions
My light is brilliant

Woooo!
I rest my case
'09, Act 3
First chapter of the end
The last chapter of a new beginning
If it's so
The things we do without even trying...
Be better than a lot of y'all records, don't get mad
Morning after, world premiere
Me!
For real, though?
I ain't even gon' say nothing
Matter of fact; I ain’t saying—
I don't even know why I'm sayin’ this
Jay, you should get Puff to do this over
We moving out, onto the next record
And, um, I'ma let this just ride
Ride, ride, ride

Exhibit A (Transformations),Victory,2009.0,"And his own story was as curious as his narrative
The tale of his life is the tale of a writer of incredible vision
An astute analyst and pundit
A lyricist compassionate and callous
A reckless hedonist and disaffected malcontent

I spit that, Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerates
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Get that type of media coverage Obama get
Spit that Kurt Vonnegut
That blow your brain, Kurt Cobain, that Nirvana shit
Who gon' bring the game back?
Who gon' spit that Ramo on the train tracks?
That gold rope, that five-finger ring rap, running with my same pack
You can find the Christ where the lepers and the lames at
Life is like a dice game
One roll could land you in jail or cutting cake, blowing kisses in the rice rain
Nice whip, nice chain, a closet of skulls
The stench is like slave blood at Providence Hall, yeah
They built my city on top of a grave
Nigga die, a nigga get high and watch the parade
Back in the early '90s, where they at, where they at
Get the gat, get the gat was a popular phrase
Bally Animals and Rugbys was a popular craze
This the vivid memoirs of a obnoxious slave
I pave ways like Nat and Harriet
I blast on Judas Iscariot and peel off in the chariot, uhh
I'm sitting pretty, spitting flames, gripping grains
Ain't a damn thing changed

How does he do it?
My dear boy, do you ask a fish how it swims? (No)
Or a bird how it flies? (No)
No siree, you don't! They do it because they were born to do it
What you are witnessing dear friends
Is the most enormous miracle of the machine age
Behold! A confectionery behemoth!

They say Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream
Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream
Knock a man's house down and build a casin'
A two thousand dollar government check from FEM'
I swam down shit's creek and came up clean
With a new lease on life like Andy Dufresne
It's the most poetical, Nat King unforgettable
Clarence 13X Allah's rhapsody from Bellevue
I'm splitting atoms, spitting flames
Bringing change, things will never be the same
I got the rap game singing At Last like Etta James
Lames get they plane shot down like John McCain
It's a dream, it's a dream
The flow is elegant like Miss Coretta Scott King
A lot of kings seen death and turn queen
Crack they twenty-four-inch rims in the ravine
Respect the architect, never test the Elohim
Goodnight, this is Jay Elec, live from New Orleans

My journey has brought me to an understanding
Of the divine forces which we have all been bestowed
It was in this search that I came upon a revelation
Which has called me to guide millions of people towards their righteous destiny",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-exhibit-a-transformations-lyrics
The Blinding,A Written Testimony,2020.0,"This shit make you wanna talk crazy, crazy, crazy
I'm tryin' to...
Kayfa ḥal-uk? Kayfa ḥal-uk, habibi?

Once upon a time there was a likkle yout, the cub of a lion
A stowed away captive, a long way home from Zion
The dove Prince sang about in ""Purple Rain"" cryin'
To the midget you heard tale of on the shoulders of the giant
Listen, I named my son, Sir, so you gotta call my son, ""Sir""
That boy already knighted, he ain't even out his romper
You speakin' on the kingdom, you better watch your tongue, sir
I send you where you never been, you forget where I'm from, sir?
That gossip I send bald heads, Lou Gossett out the gun, sir
I'm brazy, I'm so brazen, I'm ""Raisin in the Sun"" sir
You can catch this broad daylight, you know the Kingdom come, sir
That wheel inside the wheel, a half a mile in circumference
It's the return of the Mahdi, it's the return of the Akhis
It's the return of the lost and found tribe of Shabazz, the Annunakis
It's the return of Mr. Shakur spittin' out phlegm at paparazzi
That's my new style

Blinding (Hit-Boy)
Blinded by the light
See the stars and our sun

The gift that keeps givin' like Babushka
Kush crushed up in the studio, rollin' Kate Bush up
Extra, extra, it's Mr. Headlines
Who signed every contract and missed the deadlines
40 days, 40 nights, tryna live up to the hype
It's the road less traveled, it's the one who missed the flights
Hov hit me up like, ""What, you scared of heights?
Know your sister tired of workin', gotta do her something nice""
I'm like, ""Don't he know I stay up for Falon late nights?""
She need bread, she need rice, she need threads, she need ice
Either tell it to my bank account or say it to the dice
When I lay down in my bed it's like my head in the vice
When I look inside the mirror all I see is flaws
When I look inside the mirror all I see is Mars
In the wee hours of night, tryna squeeze out bars
Bismillah, just so y'all could pick me apart?

Shiny Suit Theory,A Written Testimony,2010.0,"One two, one two, yeah, uh huh, yeah

I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go

In the land before time
A land before altar boys, synagogues, and shrines, man was in his prime
Look how far I go in time just to start a rhyme
The method is sublime, you get blessed with every line
I'm in touch with every shrine from Japan to Oaxaca
The melanated carbon-dated phantom of the chakras
Me and Puff, we was chilling in Miami
He said, ""Nigga, fuck the underground, you need to win a Grammy
For your mama and your family, they need to see you shined up
You built a mighty high ladder, let me see you climb up
Nigga, what you scared of?
Terrorize these artificial rap niggas and spread love, pollinate they earbuds
Like you supposed to, spit it for the culture
Pay no attention to the critics and the vultures
They rather have a shot of Belvy just to spite you
They casting judgments 'cause they feel they got the right to
Fuck 'em, I let the dice roll like The Father did
I gotta shine, it's in my blood, I'm a Harlem kid
I treat my babies right, treat my ladies ladylike
Hit them with a remix to make sure that they play me twice
I thought you said, ""It's the return of the black kings
Luxurious homes, fur coats, and fat chains""

I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go

In this manila envelope, the results of my insanity
Quack said I crossed the line 'tween real life and fantasy
Can it be the same one on covers with Warren Buffett?
Was ducking the undercovers, was warring with muh'fuckers
Went from warring to Warren, undercovers to covers
If you believe in that sort of luck, your screws need adjusting
In the world of no justice and black ladies on the back of buses
I'm the immaculate conception of rappers-slash-hustlers
My God, it's so hard to conceive
But it all falls perfect, I'm like autumn is to trees
Aw, the doc interrupted
He scribbled a prescription for some Prozac, he said, ""Take that for your mustard
Boy, you must be off your rocker
If you think you'll make it off the strip before they 'Pac ya
Nigga, you gotta be psychotic or mixing something potent with your vodka
It takes a lot to shock us but you being so prosperous is preposterous
How could this nappy-headed boy from out the projects
Be the apple of America's obsession?
You totally disconnected with reality, don't believe in dreams
Since when did black men become kings?""

You have no idea, yeah
The meaning to what I say
And you have no idea
Of how I got this way
Now hear my dreams
And by the time you wake
I'll look down from the clouds
See I'm on my way

I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins and I wear 'em to the show
And let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go, let 'em go
I'm sailing on a cloud, they trailing below
My shrink told me, ""It's a feeling they'll never know""
I pack up all my sins in every L that I blow

Ghost of Soulja Slim,A Written Testimony,2020.0,"So, all you scared to death negros
Just sit down
Don't you come out to defend our enemy
You sit down and you shut up
And tell your master to come on out and deal with this

Next time they bring up the Gods, you gon' respect us
That lil' vest ain't gonna do you, I shoot from neck up
I ain't even tryna hold ya, Magnolia Slim
I'm a soldier from that mode, I'm the ghost of him
From the era of police stretcher, no cameras catch it
Drop you off in a rival hood, you rather be arrested
If you didn't have no straps, you couldn't wear your necklace
Niggas hand around your throat, that's a choker reference
My ancestors took old food, made soul food
Jim Crow's a troll too, he stole the soul music
That's the blood that goes through me, so you assumin'
I could never sell my soul, they sold they soul to me
Peaceful teaching of Rumi, but don't confuse me
You mouth off for the cameras, I make a silent movie
Now here's some jewelry
No civilization is conquered from the outside until it destroys itself from within
Pen, put a pin in that, will come back when I fin
You can't talk like I talk 'cause you ain't been where I been, young

If it come from me and Hov, consider it Qur'an
If it come from any of those, consider it Harām
The minaret that Jigga built me on the Dome of the Roc
Was crafted, so beautifully, consider this Adhan
From a hard place and a rock to the Roc Nation of Islam
I emerged on the wave that Tidal made to drop bombs
I came to bang with the scholars
And I bet you a Rothschild I get a bang for my dollar
The synagogue of Satan want me to hang by my collar
But all praise due to Allah Subhanahu wa ta'ala
I put on for my nation like I'm King T'Challa
Crushing the oyibo that try to bring wahala
You want it, I got it
Don't make me have to blast this rocket, uh

The thing he need like a whole in his head is publicity
Though he shine like a Christmas tree
Verily, verily, I tread through life merrily

Things you say today, I was sayin' then

­better in tune w the infinite,Act II,2014.0,"If one would open up truth, such as the truth of God to the people, I do think that He's within his rights to stay out of the sight of the people until He has won everything to Himself; as the Bible refers to it like this: He's something like a king looking for a kingdom. And that He goes and he visits the people, then He leaves the people, goes away and waits until the time when that He can secure the kingdom. Then He returns to the people that He had made Himself manifest to. So I think that's a pretty good answer

Well, I can't do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's go inside here, just come along, I'll show you, that's right, here. Sit down right here, that's it. This, this is the same genuine, magic, authentic crystal used by the priest of Isis and Osiris in the days of the pharaohs of Egypt. In which, Cleopatra first saw the approach of Julius Caesar and Mark Antony and so on and so on. Now you better close your eyes, my child, for a moment, in order to be better in tune with the infinite

It's frustratin' when you just can't express yourself
And it's hard to trust enough to undress yourself
To stand exposed and naked, in a world full of hatred
Where the sick thoughts of mankind control all the sacred
I pause, take a step back, record all the setbacks
Fast forward towards the stars and the jetpack
My feet might fail me, my heart might ail me
The synagogues of Satan might accuse or jail me
Strip, crown, nail me, brimstone hail me
They might defeat the flesh but they could never ever kill me
They might can feel the music but could never ever feel me
To the lawyers, to the sheriffs, to the judges
To the debt holders and the law makers
Fuck you, sue me, bill me
That name on that birth certificate, that ain't the real me
The lies can't conceal me
The sun rise and the moon tides and the sky's gon' reveal me
My brain pours water out my tear ducts to heal me
My Lord's too beneficent
The message grab a hold to every ear it get whispered in
The waters in the bayous of New Orleans still glistenin'
The universe is listenin', be careful what you say in it
My grandma told me every bed a nigga make, he lay in it
The church you go to pray in it, the work is on the outside
Staring out the windows is for love songs and house flies

I've got somethin' to say
I, I've got somethin' to say

Yesterday, yesterday is gone
Tomorrow, tomorrow is on the way
You don't have time to waste
Gotta get it right
Yesterday, yesterday is gone
Tomorrow, tomorrow is on the way
You don't have time to waste
Gotta get it right
Yesterday, yesterday is gone
Tomorrow, tomorrow is on the way
You don't have time to waste
Gotta get it right",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-better-in-tune-w-the-infinite-lyrics
Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),What The F*ck Is A Jay Electronica,2007.0,"The boy raps over movie scores. His last rap was over the movie score for Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
She say she never fell in love with a Superman
Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran
I told her that being a mortal is the portal
To the true nature of growth; the Christlike Buddha man
That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight
Bright lights, white ice to the fans
The radio is just a stereo, like a house ain't a home
And a chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van
Go to work; go to church let your dreams die
Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie
Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas
This is the gist of the life that we lead, why?
So you can fit in, with the closed-minded in the sit-ins
And get clothes-lined in the ed-end
I could care less about a plaque and Bid-enz
And gettin' Punked on TV by my friends
Don't get a nigga wrong
I get tempted by the rewards that all come along with making nigga songs
But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew
And because of that alone we don't get along
And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this
The radio stations'll never put a nigga on
Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy
Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones
Fuck that, fuck rap this god-hop
Kingdom music for the hard rocks
I'mma spit it 'til TRL get it and Hot 97 hit a nigga with a bomb drop
Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Whoo Kid
Just Blaze said Jay is the new kid
I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it
No drums no hook just new shit
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind
...Because He Broke the Rules
Grandpa Joe: Wh-When does he get it?
Willy Wonka: He doesn't
Grandpa Joe: Why not?
Willy Wonka: Because he broke the rules
Grandpa Joe: What rules? We didn't see any rules, did we, Charlie?
Willy Wonka:  Wrong, sir! Wrong! Under section 37B of the contract signed by him, it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void if - and you can read it for yourself in this photostatic copy:
Willy Wonka: I, the undersigned, shall forfeit all rights, privileges, and licenses herein and herein contained, et cetera, et cetera... Fax mentis incendium gloria cultum, et cetera, et cetera... Memo bis punitor delicatum!
Willy Wonka: It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal! You stole fizzy lifting drinks! You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!
The handling of a heart's a very delicate art cause it's paper thin
One irrelevant thought that started out as a spark could be a poisonous dart
That leaves a permanent mark, that's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark
And makes you never wanna see her face again
Tee-hee, what a place I'm in
Lead me to the station
A one-way ticket, don't look back
One cold tear that froze and cracked
A whole lot of pain I'm holdin' back
Chav said, ""Eff that, roll the sack""
I said, ""If my skull was cracked
And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac
That could not match me where I'm at""
My memories flash me there and back
Yup there goes me right there in black
Holdin' hands, not starin' back
She starts cryin' I start denying, it's my fault
And I'm aware of that
Man, in hindsight signs be glarin' back
Where's the map to show you where you're at?
I can hear the crowd yelling, I can smell the tire smoke
I can hear the starter pistol where's the track?
Ring no answer came home late
Jane told Dick she had a date
But they was just chillin' and at that moment
The right brain says to the left just kill em
Make the headlines, make the front page
Wild out in the court house man thrill 'em
They'll say, ""The boy dead wrong,"" but I feel him
Voodoo Man
Voodoo man, chicken bone chicken bone
I can make a thunderstorm from a light rain
My ears start ringing, my nose get bloody
I feel a little bit of pressure on my right brain
Intermission transmission put me in submission
Glistening trapped in the light prison whistling
The Christ told me come closer to the light man
I went blind, woke up in front of a mic stand
Voodoo man, tap dancing in the French Quarter
Walking on water with a scroll in my hand
The blueprints for a disc shaped-like vessel
That was chiseled out of metal off the coast of Japan
Fasting on the top of a mountain out in Tepoztlán
Saw a shiny object floating out of the ocean
I'm sort of like a postman
You can get the message if you want to understand
From the rap Son of Man
...on November 7th saw this disc-shaped object floating above the sea concourse of the United Airlines at O'Hare. Very low in the sky, it was still daylight, very distinct. Didn't look like an airplane, a helicopter, or anything else
Voodoo man, civilize the savage
Criticize the parish
Spreading false doctrine
Terrorize the cleric for carrying on nonsense
Specialized lies to paralyze the conscience
Voodoo man, chit chatter Abracadabra
Spitting out matter while I'm shitting out data
Mmm, chew 'em up shitting out rappers
Sipping Pellegrino while I'm giving out matches
Set yourself on fire
Let the wisdom of Elijah purify ya
Take a nigga higher
Sold your soul to the highest buyer
Now you're on the wire talking about two-foot tires
Saying you sell crack
Clapping at cats with macs
But you a liar pants on fire
Same old rugged cross
Different crucified messiah
FYI
Elijah Muhammad: Don’t get me wrong now. Don’t make a mistake in thinking that I’m telling you this was the beginning of the man on the Earth. Fifty thousand years ago is like telling you thirty days ago or ten days ago or five days ago, to the age of the universe. We have no exact record of it but it runs way into the trillions
While you was blowin' X amount of dollars on a bracelet
The sovereign nation of France was openin' they files on the UFO phenomenon: i.e. spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack may as well face it
Every rhyme I write the seal get cracked in the chapter of Revelations
A atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit
Call me Jay Dogon, I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder why don't he bust
Allah blessed me with a Midas-y touch
Everything I lay to hands turn to Ethiopian gold: shiny and buffed
I got a firm understandin' on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper 'bout how he ain't got rhymes
That's fuckin' with mine's
I'm trying to kill Lucifer, so if I have to brake
Cause a rapper in my face tellin' me that he the great
You can bet a shiny nickel I'll blast his motherfuckin' ass way past Jupiter
You couldn't be stupider
Fuckin' with the nuclear
Mayan, Aztec lion
Asiatic Blackman from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltryptamine make a man dream
But y'all would much rather hear me rappin' 'bout trash
The size of Erykah's ass, blunts and cash
We need savin'
Minds are consumed with swine we need bathin'
Willy Wonka: There it goes. Hold on tight. I'm not exactly sure what's going to happen. Faster, faster...if we don't pick up enough speed, we'll never get through
Charlie: Get through what?
Willy Wonka: Ah-ha!
Grandpa Joe: You mean we're going...
Willy Wonka: Up and out!
Grandpa Joe: But this roof is made of glass. It'll shatter
Into a thousand pieces. We'll be cut to ribbons!
Willy Wonka: Probably.  Hold on, everybody. Here it comes!

Yo, 'cause it's— it's so good, right?
'Cause it's like, man, it's needed, you know what I mean?
Gotta finish them scriptures, mane
It's needed, mane, it's needed

Eyes fiery, cry tears to my diary
Sometimes a Xanny bar can't help you fight back the anxiety
I go to my Lord quietly, teardrops on our faces
Teardrops on my face, it's like teardrops become waterfalls by the time they reach my laces
My eyelids is like levees but my tear ducts is like glaciers
As I contemplate creation, the salt that heals my wounds pour out my eyes just like libations
I can't stop my mind from racing, I got numbers on my phone
Pictures on my phone
The day my mama died, I scrolled her texts all day long
The physical returns but the connection still stay strong
Now I understand why you used to cry sometimes we ride down Claybourne
You just missed your— You just missed your mama
Now I just miss my mamas
The clothes we wear to bed at night to sleep is just pajamas
The flesh we roam this earth in is a blessing, not a promise
I bow with those who bow to the creator and pay homage

Sleep well
Lately, I haven't been sleepin' well
I even hit the beach to soak my feet and skip some seashells
Sleep well
The lump inside my throat sometimes just towers like the Eiffel
Sometimes I wonder do the trees get sad when they see leaves fell
Sleep well
The last time that I kissed you, you felt cold but you looked peaceful
I read our message thread when I get low and need a refill
Sleep well
Sleep well, sleep well
Lately, I haven't been sleeping well, sleeping well

I got numbers in my phone that'll never ring again

Universal Soldier,A Written Testimony,2020.0,"This is the gallant crew that rolled the big super fort
Which carried the first atomic bomb to Japan
Piloted by Colonel Paul Tibbets Jr. of Miami
Carrying Navy Captain William Parsons of Chicago
Who helped design the bomb, as observer
And Major Thomas Ferebee of Mocksville, North Carolina
Who pulled the plug on Hiroshima
The B-29 dropped its load of atomic death
Which exploded with a force equal to 20,000 tons of TNT

The son of slaves, true, I started out as a peasant (Uh-uh)
That's why I build my temple like Solomon in the desert (Uh-uh)
The Lord is my rock, I speed dial through salat
My trials in the fiery crucible made me hot
I glow like embers of coal, born with a touch of gold
My mathematical theology of rhymin' a touch the soul
I spent many nights bent off Woodford
Clutchin' the bowl, stuffin' my nose
Some of the cons, I suffered for prose
My poetry's livin' like the God that I fall back on
And all praises due to Allah for such a illustrious platform
The teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad's my backbone
When I spit, 
the children on the mothership bow on a platform
The true history of Jesus comin' to age
I wore a ski mask and glove to the masquerade
Uh, I got the Roc on my shoulder (It's the Roc)
Somebody should've told you, I'm a motherfuckin' universal soldier

Back when Emory Jones was catchin' the fed' charge
I knew less about Chessimar
All about Pablo Escobar
Thinkin' I was the last one Allah would lay his blessings on
I was trying not to end up like Tony in the restaurant
Now I'm the general of the geechie army
What don't kill us make us stronger, that's Nietzsche on me
Hot boy like I'm B.G.
, 
that Fiji on me
We done ducked them fed' charges, now we eatin' confit
Le fric, c'est chic
That guilt trip ain't gon' work, don't put your luggage on we
You ain't keep the same energy for the du Pont's and Carnegie's
We was in your cotton fields, now we sittin' on Bs, on me

The Neverending Story,A Written Testimony,2020.0,"Have you ever heard the tale of
The noblest of gentlemen who rose up from squalor?
Tall, dark, and decked out in customary regalia
Smellin' like paraphernalia
Hailin' from the home of Mahalia
His uptown smile was gold like a Frankie Beverly day
His favorite song from Prince was not ""Raspberry Beret""
It was ""Sometimes It Snows In April""
He was brought up by the faithful
In the cage of every unclean bird, ungrateful and hateful
The legend of the clandestine reverend from the Bricks
With the master's grip to pull the sleeping giant out the ditch
And I ain't even have to wiggle my nose like Bewitched
I just up-shift to six, convert the V4 to a broomstick
Though I tarry through the valley of death, my Lord give me pasture
If you want to be a master in life, you must submit to a master
I was born to lock horns with the Devil at the brink of the hereafter
Me, the socket, the plug, and universal adapter
The prodigal son who went from his own vomit
To the top of the mountain with five pillars and a sonnet
The autobiography read Quranic
Spread love like Kermit the Frog, that permeate the fog
I'm at war like the Dukes of Hazzard against the Bosses of the Hogs
Gip-Gip-Giggity, Alchemist put the icing on the soliloquy
Let it be forever known that I niced up to pen something considerably
Jay Electollah Flomeini mainly is support mainly
The fatwa he issued on al-Shayṭān was delivered plainly
It's the day of Qiyāmah
To the believers, I bring you tidings of joy
But if you want beef, I'll filet mignon ya
You could catch me bummy as fuck or decked out in designer
On I-10 West to the desert, on a Diavel like a recliner
Listen to everything from a lecture
From the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan
To Serge Gainsbourg or Madonna or a podcast on piranhas
What a time we livin' in, just like the scripture says
Earthquakes, fires, and plagues, the resurrection of the dead

I'm a miracle born with imperial features
I'm a page turner, sage burner, Santeria
Chongón, December baby, my Orishas
Saint Hov, story takes place in ancient Egypt
They'll cut off the nose to spite their face, they'll steal ya Jesus
I can't tell Hattie White that blue-eyed version is make believe stuff
She throw me out the house, say, ""Ye deliver us from this heathen""
I say that to Ms. Tina, she'll sneeze at sun, her photic reflex
They both had straightening combs, little did they know
I hold the heat next
Neither tool can be used to fix our defects
P.S. we born perfect, fuck all the B.S
Everybody wanna be us for real, we just gotta see us

Then spray 'em wit them rhymes you like spilling
Hit 'em up real, real good but don't kill him
We only want to burn him to the point that they willing

the blank face villain
Who split atoms and give mushrooms to civilians
Hiroshima never recovered and all the evidence was smothered
Under a thick cloud of rubble
The pope is his brother
The hillsides is his mother
That statue with the torch and steel eyes is his lover
She's a harlot, who stood still like time while New York turned scarlet
And the levee monster sucked up New Orleans
While they was playin' man vs. man in Afghanistan
With they mind on Iran, Iraq
 
and Sudan
Let him recruit you, he will try to use his powers to seduce you
Just let him think that the feeling is mutual
Because if he found out that you already knew
The atom had a positive, a negative and a neutral
He'll probably salute you
Then wait till you turn your back like a coward and shoot you

I got that black on black skin tone, actual-fact syndrome
That's why I dropped the jewel on every verse you heard me shit on
Okay, it's a Slumdog opera
The tale of a king whose name wasn't on the roster
My road to glory was Road To Perdition
And ""Act II: The Turn"" is just the memoirs with no omissions
We came a mighty long way from standing near the stove
In the cold, the greatest story ever told
The realest niggas see the pain in my story boards
The true believers say, ""Wallahi, I support the boy""

This is lightning striking, feel how the Zeitgeist feel
Get a slight chill

All hail the lyrical, Grand Wizard Imperial
Nigga signed the dotted line with Hov, that's a miracle
And I ain't leave the thugs alone
The humble and the meek will surely inherit the mud we on
And shoot up every club we clone
The flow is too atomic
The poetry's too Qur'an-ic, the young prophet Muhammad
And I could drop a verse to change the whole vibration
The whole Roc Nation, the whole Live Nation

Beware, but prepare for the polarization, it's the globalization
Warn all the clergymen and notify Satan

A thousand kisses to the haters 'cause they made me greater
A thousand wishes from a million slaves could raise a savior
A thousand visits to these dickheads at these major labels
From Big Daddy Kane to Big Daddy Cain and Abel
You pay a cost to be a boss, nigga, I paid the wager
Mastered both sides of the force and plus I made my sabre
Yes sir, I'm a soldier of love
Drowning all my sorrows and woes in the club
My white boys say, ""that shit you spit last year, bro
Was like a real fine Merlot and a cashmere throw""
Some black chicks say he ugly, white women they love me
My Asians and my mamis don't put nothing above me

You lame, I know you guys well
If you can name an MC that's flamer than me, you high as hell
You can't dance with the chancellor
One glance'll have you caught up in the trance of the tarantula
And if they could, then they probably would
They come close but it's no cigar, welcome to my world

Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours

Your arms too short to box with the sender of the prophets
Aviator shades, the stage is a cockpit
Leather Pelle, lounging at the Sofitelle
Sipping Sam Pelegrino eating Ghiradellis
I recline and chill, twinkling the rag to shine my grill
That's that third ward appeal (bitch)
Get at me, me and my chick is like JFK and Jackie
They can't wait to catch me in Dallas
Top down on the grassy knoll and clap me
Kidnap my body and fuck up the autopsy
But I'm nice like Christ, you blink twice you hit
I'm chilling in College Park eating salmon and grits
It's the black Caesar, Jesus,
 he's just
A lyrical monster, boogie man outta the dumpster
Black Pharaoh, 
Jay Bowie spitting fat arrows
Keep your eye on the sparrow and the fly apparel
You ain't ready for war, hide your barrel
Stay in your lane man, chance for surviving is narrow
Welcome to my world

Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours

Deep in the jungle busting
Nickle sacks of cracks from G Packs for stacks
Niggas on the humble hustling
See that game, that's the one they call survival
Man, they popping at five-oh
They lowlife pigs who get it how they live
They daddies in them court houses giving out bids
Chopping niggas on blocks and leaving wickedness
Man they embroidered the land, then they smallpoxed the witnesses
Raping babies using ladies as they mistresses
Causing chaos and disorder
That's why the Glock on hold, the block on swole
I built this city on rock and roll
Now I'm banging on Rumsfeld and bells ringing
Him and Dick'll be in hell singing
Woe to the hypocrites and infidels screaming niggas can't handle
The wrath of the son of man black pandemonium
Yeah, the flow's that scandalous
I crush any MC who feel they must
Try me, the smallest flea on the dog won't get by me
If I was you I'd be scared to death
Hit a nigga up, leave him right there in his mess
This penicillin I'm spilling leave hair on your chest you feel me
You can't beat me, kill me
I'll be back in three days disguised as a gardener with my kicks filthy
Told you I was nice like Christ the rap angels throw down ice
I shine like jewelry in light
I can make a true believer out a curious dyke
She'll be wearing hijab singing 'hamdulillah!'
I'll be slinging dice humming songs on the ave
They'll be saying ""Man, he going off the path""
But that's on the low though
Beating cats with no glow, tryna play me like a ho
But this ain't rooks and pawns or tic tac toe
This planets, moons, quasars, and high-tech radars
You niggas on the grid while Jay man stay gone off the radar (AWOL)

I say yeah, I say
I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say

I was born on Tatooine with dreams of sand, I kept going
The blind would undermine my plans, I kept growing
God bless the child that has, I kept building
One can't rewind the past, I push forward
The pain was too much to bear, I kept hurting
Nobody could feel me there, I kept quiet
The tears would begin to well, I just fought em
They say you gotta pay your dues, I just bought em
What they don't know won't hurt em'
I pledge to never be no one's burden
Mama said never disrespect your neighbors
Cause next week, we might have to check for favors
That's science, I could never thank her for it
And 20/20 hindsight is so euphoric
Keep shining, nobody could stop your progress
Because unknown forces move some known objects
That's magic

I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah
I say yeah
I say yeah, I say

The long road home, the crown, the throne, I kept searching
Made time to find my own, I kept asking
Never ever strayed my course, I kept passion
Tried to reconnect my force, I kept fasting
Felt something inside my soul, I kept reaching
And even though that verse got old, I kept preaching
Even when the mosque got cold, we kept teaching
Selling Final Calls on Broad and Allegheny
Cause who gon save them babies?
And finally put a definite into all those maybes
A scholar and a gentleman to all those ladies
The haters and the naysayers say ya'll so crazy
That's physics, a necessary part of the story
And 20/20 hindsight is so euphoric
Keep shining, nobody could stop your progress
Because unknown forces move some known objects
That's magic

I walked across the water
I came by myself
I climbed the highest mountain
And I ain't never being nailed
Hell yeah
Say yeah

Catch me in Mexico meditating with Quetzalcoatl fuckers
I'm rainin fire on you lame suckers
My tongue is the burner the barrel the biscuit don't make me buck it spratt
I'm outta that Mac 
I came into rap carrying the south on my back
And I'm ready to scriddap

The mic is always in my holster right on top of my hip
Niggas get flipped

Knockin other motherfuckers out the ring like Apollo Creed

It's not a op-tion I got Pac on, Makaveli the Don
Bumpin' that ""Me And My Glock"" song, zonin'
Like Robert Dinero with Ronin
Struck 'em up with the omen

Walk a mile in my shoes; it proves you a soldier
I paid a lot of dues to prove to Jehovah

Everywhere I roam is home; life's my battleground
Sallhuddin Abdul Fard Muhammad
The come up at by night, ridin' Elijah the comet (uh)
I caved chest in the brave chessman
Masterin' one twenty lessons is my profession
So get to steppin'

Special Officer Flowers in the army of the lord
Commander of forgotten angels at home and abroad
As sure as the Motherplane is the Throne of Fard
I swear to go the stone and come home with the sword
It's globally known, I float on the track like the coast guard
Every pigeon I spit is like a train or a postcard
It's magic the way I created fame out of folklore
And got bigger than Tom Hanks when he was playing by the Zoltar

Voodoo man, chicken bone chicken bone
I can make a thunderstorm from a light rain
My ears start ringing, my nose get bloody
I feel a little bit of pressure on my right brain
Intermission transmission put me in submission
Glistening trapped in the light prison whistling
The Christ told me come closer to the light man
I went blind, woke up in front of a mic stand

Voodoo man, tap dancing in the French Quarter
Walking on water with a scroll in my hand
The blueprints for a disc shaped-like vessel
That was chiseled out of metal off the coast of Japan
Fasting on the top of a mountain out in Tepoztlán
Saw a shiny object floating out of the ocean
I'm sort of like a postman
You can get the message if you want to understand
From the rap Son of Man

...on November 7th saw this disc-shaped object floating above the sea concourse of the United Airlines at O'Hare. Very low in the sky, it was still daylight, very distinct. Didn't look like an airplane, a helicopter, or anything else

Voodoo man, civilize the savage
Criticize the parish
Spreading false doctrine
Terrorize the cleric for carrying on nonsense
Specialized lies to paralyze the conscience
Voodoo man, chit chatter Abracadabra
Spitting out matter while I'm shitting out data
Mmm, chew 'em up shitting out rappers
Sipping Pellegrino while I'm giving out matches
Set yourself on fire
Let the wisdom of Elijah purify ya
Take a nigga higher
Sold your soul to the highest buyer
Now you're on the wire talking about two-foot tires
Saying you sell crack
Clapping at cats with macs
But you a liar pants on fire
Same old rugged cross

Dear Moleskine (2012),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Have you ever ever ever been depressed so bad
It was a struggle every day not to regret your past
Feeling cursed like you never ever get your swag
And you was speeding down the highway when your threshold pass
When you cried all your tears out
And one page of your diary can tell you what your year ’bout
That’s a lonely place
My mama said “Son, why such a lonely face?”
Because the pressure’s on me
Plus I feel like Bill Murray trapped in Punxsutawney
Dr. Phil told me that I can sell crack or hit the army
Look at where we live at
Tell me you don’t hear that
Tell me you don’t feel that
Show me to the way out
Tell me when pastor Raphael gon’ reveal that
If not, man I’m outta here
I’m just a sleep walking robot that’s outta gear
I stick my nose out the water to the sky for air
Lama sabachthani
I’m trying to see light but the devil trying to blind me
The grim reaper walking with his shovel right behind me
Trying to introduce me to the untimely unkindly
I Walk the line finely like Johnny Cash
But I keep getting visits from the ghost of the past
So I spark another L then I go to the pad


Yeah I can reconcile being depressed real bad
I’m a thinker not a drinker but still I hennessy drag
Alcohol numbs the pain like with novacane stabs
In your arteries pardon me but my city go mad
Via Compton California, corners with coroners and karma on em
Colors corresponding to gangs upon us
Common corrupted crip & piru’s cripple the city
Triple the crime, Bible nor the Qur’an can save
Welcome don’t be afraid, your city similar right?
Where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
Stare at the sky wonder will you live to see 25?
I’m 22 at 20 I knew I was against the odds
This kid named Jonathan was monitorin’
His momma & sister, his older cousin he honoured him
Anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishin’
To Johnny he might have been a modern day rider then
He walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
Pull out a mac 11, now his eyes is big
Fascinated by mayhem, what’s his cousin to say now?
He wanna be from the hood that he’s from and thats one
More gangster under the family tree, took em under his wings like KFC
Crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says “the hood made me”
No love just spread slugs thats the policy, the leader and the prodigy
Now shorty do-wap, holdin a ou-wap, hanging with rah rah’s with blah blah’s
That sit on the block catching fades, hitting licks, going on missions with lunatics
A 9th grade menace thugging for 6 months, smoking like 6 blunts
An hour the power of banging, he was walking… *3 Gun Shots*
Little Johnny

I think you’ll find, sir, that there will come a time
When black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
As other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
Then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
And this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
And then at that point you’ll have a situation
Where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
And this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
And this type of thinking also will bring an end
To the brutality inflicted upon black people by (black people)
And it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
No federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
It’s something that the black man has to bring an end to",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-dear-moleskine-2012-lyrics

(Knocking)

I want to thank you
For being so blind (so blind)
You didn't know (didn't know)
That it was my time
They should have told you
I am for the people
And on my shoulders
Carrying the world
Say it sir victory is mine oh yeah

I tumble like the dice do
Stay on the humble like Christ do
Piss stanzas and shite haikus
Since I was a young tyke who
Tried to moonwalk like Michael
I understood the Universe's cycles
Positive negative neutral
Impoverished kids on sedatives'll never live mutual
Where reverends, presidents, movie stars, cinema-togra-phers
And producers, so standardized education in its current state
Is useful, I'm mean useless
Pardon the slippage
The dead'll probably target the jargon as gibberish
Meanwhile I'm off in the stars warring with Iblis
You see them atoms spinning
You see them waves shimmerin'
You see them Wisdoms grinning
The masculine energy make them feel feminine
I transformed, they start assembling
From Moab to Menden
Sitting bull is twisting sitting ducks like dutches
Victory is in my clutches
Motherfuckers

Victory is mine, oh yeah

You can't touch this like Hamm and them
I'm on auto pilot, sipping Pinot Noir, eating sal-a-mon
Brother with Falon, and the son of Marilyn
Chancellor of hope
Sharp like razor, clean like soap
The simplest metaphors be the dope
They stumbling out of focus
I spit that hocus pocus
Man these niggas absolutely bogus
Your cockroach flow is hopeless
I'm on they ass like locusts

Victory is mine, oh yeah

In and out the studio
The flow is unruly so
My attack level is way higher than Yu-Gi-Ohs
My defence level is in the trillions
So if you want to duel
Your rocket better be filled up with fuel
Cause when you get here, I'll be on the stool, cracking booze
And you'll be tired from the journey
So how you think that you could ever burn me
Man these wack niggas don't concern me
Bring out the gurneys and summon my attorneys

And those fleeting bits of satisfaction, turn to afterthoughts
But if you say the magic word
You could call back all the birds
And see that fire in the sky, burn everything back to life
You don't have to sleep to dream and live in paradise
Abracadabra, are you watchin' closely?
Can you feel the dawn approaching?

Jailer:  Why can't you undo real locks, Professor?
Alfred Borden: Maybe I'm just biding my time. Maybe one day I'll open my hand, get your attention, and ask... 'Are you watching closely?' Maybe a magic word or two. And then I'll be... gone

Alfred Borden: ...Magic

I overheard niggas saying Jay was on the verge
He could make Rumsfeld resign with rhymes he never heard
Commune with the birds
And can manipulate matter with the usage of words
Throwin' dice on the curb
I'm the best and the freshest with the written text, fuck what you heard
It's the, metaphysical, dolby digital
Any Joe'll tell you, the flow's so pivotal
Every word's literal
Each diatribe is sort of like an interview
Come get an inner view
Right past the man and the myth to the mineral
I was born uptown a mile from the river view
Look, I'm a simple man, ya understand?
Masterin' my temple man, tryin' to expand
But when they think you simple, man
They'll try to play you out like you a simpleton
See what I'm sayin'
Niggas want pain not mercy
I'm writin' in my Moleskine on the train to Canarsie
Stand clear of the closin' doors
The people are in constant fear of a Trojan War
The vehicle that's supposed to free us is just an whore
I gotta call 'em like I see 'em
Even if it means they'll sanction my per diem
The angels will thank me in the streets if I see 'em

And the poverty line don’t go
But the dope keep coming
And the tv keep flashing images of a sports car
Then you bound for a coke war
The meek get clowned by the coke law
The sheep get drowned in the folklore
Then lulled to sleep by Tom Brokaw
What a pity, the hope on a politician's tongue
Never ever trickles down the city
So if a nigga put a president's mask on
And run up in the bank with a Mac saying ""gimme gimme!""
I ain't glad at him
But I ain't mad at him

I'm like Cassius when I blast molasses
Out the ass of the masses
From Fulton Street Mall to Gratiot
I'm handin out free at last kits
Yo, Jay, where ya staff at?
Green said you threw it
Yeah, I outgrew it
Some blogs said, “you blew it”

Because I’ve been to the mountaintop; I don’t mind
Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. 
And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over. And I've seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!
And so I'm happy, tonight
I'm not worried about anything
I'm not fearing any man!
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!!

Boom bash dash
I had to break, I had to get away
Pack my bags, headed for Greyhound, it was a Monday
Time to start my mission
I felt that burning feeling in my soul, I had to listen
I had this re-ocurring dream from the stage
 
in a suit with a fade
I had set the game ablaze and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where niggas cussed out the police and sold they crack on
Better known as back home, where they treat the Arabs and the Spanish and the blacks wrong
There he go with that song
You may be tired but I spit what I'm inspired
From the Lord of the worlds cause the devil is a liar

Say, I've seen the lightning flashing (yes I did)
And I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long)
Because I'm getting stronger (Because I keep getting stronger)

My style is like a shot of
 
Jack Daniels
, 
a baby grand piano
Lightening Hopkin, smokin' cigs, strummin' on the banjo
The son of man's the son of a gun with hella ammo
Sheriffs shootin' Bob Marley
, 
John J. Rambo
Six sextillion
, 
19 million

the holy pyramids say we all Allah's children
Voodoo for the pilgrims who bring weapons and conceal 'em
They silence you with force
 
and then indoctrinate the children

Ahmadinejad will blow up your apartment if you don’t observe the Sabbath
I look the devil in his eye and say

Then drown 'im in the mighty light his brain couldn’t fathom
Scrappin' every day, just like fight club
A thriller and a smooth criminal like Mike was

Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,Act I: The Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),2007.0,"She say she never fell in love with a Superman
Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran
I told her that being a mortal is the portal
To the true nature of growth; the Christlike Buddha man
That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight
Bright lights, white ice to the fans
The radio is just a stereo, like a house ain't a home
And a chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van
Go to work, go to church, let your dreams die
Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie
Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas
This is the gist of the life that we lead, why?
So you can fit in, with the closed-minded in the sit-ins
And get clothes-lined in the ed-end
I could care less about a plaque and Bid-enz
And gettin' Punked on TV by my frid-ends
Don't get a nigga wrong
I get tempted by the rewards that all come along with making nigga songs
But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew
And because of that alone we don't get along
And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this
The radio stations'll never put a nigga on
Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy
Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones
Fuck that, fuck rap, this god-hop
Kingdom music for the hard rocks
I'mma spit it 'til TRL get it and Hot 97 hit a nigga with a bomb drop
Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Whoo Kid
Just Blaze said, ""Jay is the new kid""
I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it
No drums no hook, just new shit

A Prayer for Michael Vick and T.I.,What The F*ck Is A Jay Electronica,2007,"You got a hell of a nerve
If, if my rhetoric is too strident
Who better to correct me than my brothers?
And my sisters?
If I need to be brought in line or refined
Who better to do it than the members of my own family?
We don’t get into your family business
You stay out of ours

I never got shook up by talks of Illuminati
I’m from where niggas talk that talk
Then walk around the streets all day
Carrying heat like the human body
Stress – we mastered that
Death – we laugh at that
You niggas sweeter than the cog-ni-ac
I never sleep
And when my eyes is closed, I'm in a deep battle for sheep
I’m an insomniac
But when it comes to the rhymes, a hypochondriac
The flow so sickly, splash a hot round on me
Peel off quickly
Luckily, not one of you niggas could fuck with me
I hit you with a plus degree
Mind detect mind, plus mind detect matter
With that, I say peace to the G.O.'s
And all my niggas locked away in cages, giving shit to the C.O.'s
Doing long stretches on the track
Cause they fell into the trap of the Neos
The Farrakhan of rap, giving dap to the people
Busting shots at the eagle, with the arrows in its talon
Sneaking shots when you peep through your peephole
Spit the abracadabra, manipulate matter with a black magic
Created to eradicate evil
So if they call me a rapper, okay, yeah, I can dig it
But if they bring me before the Congress, then I can kick it
I send the devil to hell every time that I get wicked
Ayah to ayah, sura by sura yeah, I get lifted
 ""People do say I'm cocky, some say I need a good whoopin', some say... I talk too much, but anything that I say I'm willing to back up... I have fulfilled all of my prophecies, I'm up to date in all of my predictions, my train is running on schedule.""

One for the money, two for the pussy and fame
Three hundred’ll go to the court to change my name like Cassius
The past just show me lessons
Stay on my grind and pray that time will show me blessings
Was my old motto
I'm from the Magnolia Projects, where dice rollers and heroin addicts is role models
So I had no choice but to kick it to full throttle
My niggas in Philly'll probably tell you ""the boy’s thorough.""
Now, either you with me or you with me
Cuz even if you against me, running with my enemies
They ain't nothing but mini-mes
That I created long, long ago
And they only want to cut off
My lineage like the Kennedies
That being the case
You should be aware I blast many a face
And left niggas displaced like Katrina did
And gave them very little of nothing like FEMA did
And I ain't never seen a bid
Well, there was one time when me and Ali tussled with one-time
For claiming our sovereignty as a nation and bloodline
You niggas should give a standing ovation

Hitting them with creation",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-a-prayer-for-michael-vick-and-ti-lyrics
Call of Duty,R.I.P.,UnKnown,"Centuries ago words were written to be a call and a spur to the faithful servants of Truth and Justice.

As the Will of God is in Heaven, even so let it be

Burn slow like blunts with yayo

Yeah, put your diamonds in the sky

If it’s hate, wait your turn, dig a crate, make a urn
Please God, tell Flex drop a bomb on me
Tell the Minister to tattoo the Qur'an on me
Before the men in black try to pin a crime on me
And Rupert Murdoch and his goons get to lyin' on me
The Lord is my shepherd
So tell the royal family to order my records
And spread 'em cross Europe in a organized method
We could heal the planet with a organized effort
The Jews and the Christians and the Muslims and the Buddhists
And the Sikhs and Scientologists is all of my brethren

You never heard another nigga say this on the radio
We made it out the ghetti-o
Brunch with the Rothschilds, dinner with the Carters
Jay Elect stop the press, criticalest artist


I done sat around for years daydreamin’ of this
Me and Jay biz, green gettin’ twist
Kids goin’ to school, we still on the bench
Early mornin’ yawning, no sleep, just this
Hardcore, rhymin’ like a diamond when I spit
Come hell or high water, we gon’ make it out the bricks
I done graduated gladiator school, what’s next?
From the bottom, only one way to go to the tip
Of the top,
 
with these nonstop flows I invent
Bars so hard, shit hurt when it hit
My bars like prison bars, I’m trapped in the pens
Of this wildstyle hip-hop, the fuckin’ strongest

Kamikaze love, self-destructive patterns
Mercury in retrograde, four house of Saturn
Nothing makes me sadder than
Hailing cabs alone goin home on a Saturday
Bumpin' Donny Hathaway, questioning my choices
Thinkin 'bout marriage, carriage, and horses
Manor on a hectare of land like a fortress
I hope you understand me
Yo, I'm cold like New York, my heart is warm like Miami
I'm just trying to build a Kingdom for my people and my Family
Sometimes I don't know what to say
The pain never stops, the cloud never goes away
The rain never drops

Something To Hold Onto,Style Wars,2007,"Bismillah
Surah 115
I'm trying to find that missing note
While you niggas is at the club looking for pussy
I'm try- I'm looking for the missing note

As I scratch the last days off the calendar
Niggas roam the streets with heavy metal like Metallica
Pistols with the silencers, killing soldiers softly
The crime pays a little but the consequence is costly
My cousin, I love him, we go back in the days
But now he struggle with the monkey and he trapped in a maze
I still care for him, to tell the truth I'm kinda scared for him
Cause when he conscious, he in rare form
But that's the story of his life, getting locked up or shot up
Or in somebody's kitchen on the block cooking rocks up
I think he lost hope when he seen them lock his pops up
Or when he seen his sister babyfather get his knot bust
My grandmother complain and tell him make a change
But her thinking is outdated she can't understand the game
Syeah, hard time three to nine in a jailhouse
Is no different from slaving nine to five in a warehouse

There's a lot of shit going on up in my hood
I thank God I'm alive, homey knock on wood
Yea though I walk through the valley of death
I know the lord got my back with every step
You see nothing here surprises me
I got a whole lotta soldiers down to ride with me
But lord please give me, something to hold on to
Something to hold, I need something to hold

Yo in the projects shit is mad real for the youth
Niggas get ill for the loot
The more guns ya bust, the realer your crew
Cats carry gats concealed in they suits
Whether cee-loo craps or Macs gorillas may shoot
When the eyes meet don't steer wrong and don't stare long
Cause niggas'll kill for that, when they be full of heroin
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How crews remain standing once the AK's thunder
Under the slum roof tops, career thugs cook rocks, then hit the blocks
To make a killing plus fame, man, they loving this game
It's mega action; the trees stay hot like saunas
Shorties with fly hair-dos get dipped to play the corner
Summer time they shine block parties galore
So many soldiers die, they buy a separate forty to pour
I knew this kid Larry; niggas thought he was poor
But he had cream for days, ran a solid scheme with K's
AKs with the banana clips, rubber handle grips
The same nigga that got Randal hit, he living scandalous
He used to pop no-doz so he won't be caught sleeping
And he couldn't even walk around the block cause he was beefing
I say that to say this, that's ghetto everyday shit
Where slugs miss chipped bricks leave scars on chicks
It's kinda trife right now, but that's the life right now
And way back it was a half-assed trife like now


Peace god what's today's math, just trying to escape wrath;
With two left feet, it's kinda hard to walk a straight path
Soldiers laying in gutters from God to greed
My old dad left momdukes and scarred his seed
We all family, but seemingly these cats can't stand me
Haters gonna hate be it a Lexus or a Camry, understand me
But do the knowledge first, swallow my verse
Which is my universe, God obeys no thirst
Fallen angels in the ghetto trading in they wings for things
Semiautomatic machines with red beams
Street magicians converting the crack into cream
Sat back saw 'em turn Black Zack to a fiend
He's a teacher, had a fly daughter named Lakeisha
If you hustle, have a beeper, smoke reefer, you can freak her
I seen her giving head inside the club behind the speaker
Last year she had three abortions for the preacher
And one miscarriage for this kid they call Harris
He told her that her loved her and he's moving her to Paris
She fell for it
Touched the third rail for it (uh)
And next year she would've been sixteen
Once told me that she wanted to go to God, get clean
So she could be a role model for her brother Eugene
He's a beautiful seed, eight years and can't read
At night, his asthma so bad he can't breathe
He wants to be an astronaut, and fly to space
But his teacher told him that he just ain't go what it takes
So he cried while the other kids played at lunch break

Smilin' in a nigga's face, I hate her
I can drill a hole at the Earth's equator
Fill it with dynamite and make another Moon with craters
See you later
She ain't know, that innocent shit with Obi-Wan
Behind a Jedi back can turn Anakin to Vader, 
Your lack of faith in the Force is disturbin'
And if it wasn't Jack Daniels and Parliament
Lights it would have been murder
My eyes is red like ketchup
Tired of playin' catch up
Layin' on the floor starin' at the dresser
Got on my knees and prayed 'till they bleed
Dear God, I'm a sick motherfucker
I even fooled myself I'm a slick motherfucker
I'm sick of the scandulous livin'
I don't think I'm even equipped for a higher standard of livin'
But if you give him one more chance and forgive him
He'll push that negative gene into oblivion
Here's what I'll do:
Put you in this basket and float you down the Mississippi
Twenty miles from the Bayou
Here's grace, here's style
Have faith cause I'mma try you
My momma introduced me to the scripture
The channel 4 news introduced me to that shit that produced Hitler
I was a young lad: Three Stooges, Superman, Batman, The Riddler
Moonwalk, Windmill, Freeze for the picture
My grandma taught me courage
She told me never let the grizzly bears eat your porridge
Or you'll just be a carcass dying slowly in the forest
I could never thank her for it
But I can slay a devil when I see one

That our thoughts was too slow and we couldn't adapt
When in fact
We taught ya'll how to build a label from scratch
While you was whining bout the points in your contract black, yup
We slip when we talk
And we dip when we walk
When we came to the game
Niggas stole our slang

Teeth like barbwire, feet like tires

There's no knowing where we're rowing
Or which way the river's flowing
Is it raining?
Is it snowing?
Is a hurricane a-blowing?
Not a speck of light is showing
So the danger must be growing
Are the fires of hell a-glowing?
Is the grisly reaper mowing?
Yes, the danger must be growing
Cause the rowers keep on rowing
And they're certainly not showing
Any signs that they are slowing!

On the news I seen a family of a grandma and some kids
They tore down where she lived for sixty years and told her here goes
A voucher for some powdered milk and Kleenex for your tears
You seen them tents outside of city hall? That's where they live
A trailer in the park or cardboard box under the bridge
They closed down all the projects

Uzi Weighs A Ton,Style Wars,2007,"I'm Ready

Jay Electronica
Lord of the Thunder

When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

Never will I resign I'm a soldier for life
I'm mastering my circumference controlling the mic
Behold the light
Some niggas die for their ice
See I'll part with the chain, but I'mma die for the Christ
This time I baptise with fire
Roll with a thousand soldiers like Jeremiah
Call me sire
Hitman for hire
Show me the money like J McGuire
Build my empire in the midst of the fire
Who do men say that I am, I'm a stumbling stone
I'm never too far from home cause the Earth's my throne
I'm the king supreme superb out the third, ya heard
Magnolia made me a soldier throwin dice on the curb
Crucified me the first day, I'm rockin ice on the third
Burning circles on hood corners rocking mics and them birds
I got my hard hat my work gloves, I'm ready to rock
So beware of this heavy hardware, we steady to drop

When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

Bring seven emcees, put them in a line
Go get seven other cornballs who think they can rhyme
It'll take seven more before I go for mine
That's twelve sucka niggas with a gash in they perm
Plus nine other motherfuckers drastically burned
It's a horrible lesson indeed, but has to get learned
It's the new world order
We kidnapped rap and took her south of the border
While cats rock three-sixty waves, white tees, girbauds, and diodoras
Young guns is raised in the little shop of horror
When drama get to popping and the shit get out of order
The choppers'll chop a hole up in the door of your explorer
The coppers'll pop a hole up in the door of your aurora
Watchers, dime dropper to copper sing them a story
Niggas is shiesty eh? in the land where they trill with it
Stress is a motherfucker, man, nigga deal with it

When I walk motherfucker, my uzi weighs a ton
When I talk motherfucker my uzi weights a ton

Nas gave me some sweet advice, uh huh
He came like a man with it
Took it and ran with it
I'm a turn the rap game to the summer of Sam with it
If anybody asks tell em the son of man did it
That's right, you know my name I got the devil on the run
Why? Cause my motherfuckin uzi weighs a ton
And I'm squeezing on you fuckers with the mic in my hands
That'll be terrorizing rappers from Detroit to Japan",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-uzi-weighs-a-ton-lyrics
Dealing,Attack of the Clones,2008,"At night time all I do is pray and cry homie
Cause everytime I call home somebody dyin' on me
And every time I look around somebody lyin' on me
Mr. Cheney Mr. Ridge steady spyin' on me
I got one foot in the grave one foot in the gutter
One foot on the camera lens one foot on the shutter
I'm trying to stop time so I can breathe, man I'm grindin
Play record no pause fast forward rewindin
The truth is the light, but absolutely blindin
And niggas feel the pain on they brain when you remind them
About them project walls that we confined in
About them six by eight cells we linin'
Bricks on consignment
A nigga lost his iron and club behind the diamond
The cops hit him with a club
He swung back they hit him with a slug
Then the judge hit him with a dub
His baby mama threw up
The saga continues...

I was born to clash with the fake
Wrestle with Jake
Lay real low in the grass with the snakes
Torment them with the fire when they raise they head
And I'm sorta just like Elijah cause I raise they dead
After they stink and rot for days in the grave that I rose from
Deport the dead part of the game then the flows come
Flood the industry with three quarters of life
I'm takin this world of Sa-tan to war with a mic
Please God back me as I swing the sword of the Christ
Wavy hair fiery eyes
Not entirely wise
Provoking these devils go to war with they squad
After war show them to the after party with God
I stroll the blocks with a dope man bop
I'm high caliber
My team shine supreme we gleam on you amateurs
I stay big sportin fedoras
Charcoal grey tweed sport coat jeans and diadoras

Ya'll niggas ain't really really ready for Muhammad because I'm hungry
Grimey and grungy
I want ya mind fuck the money
Don't get me wrong, I want cream and all that
But if that's your only objective in rap you all wack
I make the untrue niggas head sweat like skull caps
Hall back launchin a bolo makin they skull crack
Singin them dull raps
Like that was hot shit
Shit, I was sayin that back in the 80s
When niggas was rockin emblems off the back of Mercedes
On rope chains
Back when niggas thought of cookin rocks outta cocaine
I was hot then, a little poor nigga spittin the vicious
Flavor delicious poetic swift shit
I regulate in the ring like P. Whitaker
One rhyme get rid a ya
I won't even consider ya for battle
You schools on speed I'm full throttle
Used to be in clubs tossing chairs and cracked bottles
Ruckus and ra ra, made my rhymes mantequilla
Livin leyenda, numer un contenda
Never let a day slip by without agenda
That's just a little jewel from Farrakhan to remember
So, que te pasa?
Representando por la raza
Niggas wanna step but they legs too short to salsa
You got courage I'll blast it out ya
Seriously doubt ya
Spit til ya blueprint is ripped, then re-route ya

Act II (Rough Demo),UnKnown,2011.0,"The GM sector is very, very powerful, they're very good at generating press releases. They've been making wild promises, curing the blind, turning deserts into whatever it sees them, and growing crops without water and sun for many, many years. The reality is that almost all of their research has gone into finding mechanisms, ways of allowing them to consolidate their control over the future and that is what it's about, it's very hard to argue that. As a result of their incredible power they have managed to, in my view, compromise possibly even corrupt the regulating system and the effect is that the market is racing ahead of the science and that's the reason advancements have not become...

'Til the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, we saving the blind
I was raised by America
Had a baby with Erykah
Niggas started expecting the God to dress funny
Although, I'm fresher than a mannequin
Under pressure like Anakin
Grandma ain't ever raise a test dummy
So if life is a bitch
I'm slow dancing a song off
Romancing her thong off and taking her with me
I'mma tell ya like Rick Rozay the boss

I seen all your magic tricks, Abracadabraless
My crowd gather around; it's the resurrection of Lazarus
Pop that pussy for a real nigga
 for a Hilfiger
I never went to prom, was in a different mind
Just was in a different time than everybody else was
Not cause I ain't felt love
Even though we ain't had food all the time, we had clothing and shelter
House full of flowers, but I was the only Thedford
I remember my dad, but I was always a stepson
You know how the story go
My momma always say, ""to God be the glory though""
I kept it movin'


Nervous when they see the black man walking down the street, boppin'
Hold your head and keep rockin'
Pants sag, fuck a cop swag, keep Pac'n
It's a new world doctrine, oppression is not an option
If Sean John and Ciroc in stock, then keep shopping
What little faith you had in Barack, leave stock in

…Because He Broke the Rules,Act I: The Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),2007.0,"Grandpa Joe: Wh-When does he get it?
Willy Wonka: He doesn't
Grandpa Joe: Why not?
Willy Wonka: Because he broke the rules
Grandpa Joe: What rules? We didn't see any rules, did we, Charlie?

Willy Wonka:  Wrong, sir! Wrong! Under section 37B of the contract signed by him, it states quite clearly that all offers shall become null and void if - and you can read it for yourself in this photostatic copy:

Willy Wonka: I, the undersigned, shall forfeit all rights, privileges, and licenses herein and herein contained, et cetera, et cetera... Fax mentis incendium gloria cultum, et cetera, et cetera... Memo bis punitor delicatum!

Willy Wonka: It's all there, black and white, clear as crystal! You stole fizzy lifting drinks! You bumped into the ceiling which now has to be washed and sterilized, so you get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!

The handling of a heart's a very delicate art 'cause it's paper thin
One irrelevant thought that started out as a spark could be a poisonous dart
That leaves a permanent mark, that's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark
And makes you never wanna see her face again
Tee-hee, what a place I'm in
Lead me to the station
A one-way ticket, don't look back
One cold tear that froze and cracked
A whole lot of pain I'm holdin' back
Chav said, ""Eff that, roll the sack""
I said, ""If my skull was cracked
And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac
That could not match me where I'm at""
My memories flash me there and back
Yup there goes me right there in black
Holdin' hands, not starin' back
She starts cryin' I start denying that it's my fault
And I'm aware of that
Man, in hindsight signs be glarin' back
Where's the map to show you where you're at?
I can hear the crowd yelling, I can smell the tire smoke
I can hear the starter pistol, where's the track?
Ring no answer, came home late
Jane told Dick she had a date
But they was just chillin' and at that moment
The right brain says to the left, ""just kill em""
Make the headlines, make the front page

Intro,Act I: The Eternal Sunshine (The Pledge),2007.0,"I met Jay through, 
initially through Rashad Smith,
 a couple of nights. And he kept hitting me about this kid that hew knew who could rhyme crazy, but he just had, he just needed a break. But he felt like he was destined to be one of the great ones. So finally, he sent me some stuff, emailed me some music and I was instantly just like, wow
One day I was on 
IM and he just IM'd
 me out of nowhere and we just started kickin' it and at first I'm like, you know. We would talk and I was just like, yo, what is with this dude? He was just so, tryin' to think of the right way to put it. He would basically just ask you the craziest questions like, what would be the best way to attack this or attack that. 
Cause he's so much of a planner and a tactician and I learned that later on. At the time I didn't realize why he was asking the kind of questions he was asking me. He just wanted to know his whole plan of attack and my thing was always just, yo, just make music
I think once he got in that mindset and just started recording, it was like every other day he was sending me back something crazy.
 So we turned out to really develop a real type of relationship, almost like a brotherhood really
So it was kinda like I consider him like my, even though this is a cliche saying, like a brother from another mother. Just on the, not so much on the physical, but on the spiritual level and on an artistic level definitely. We just kinda bonded like brothers real quick and I think that's just because we have a love for the music and we're both really good natured people at heart, we just really wanna continue the culture and expand it and stuff instead of doing the same thing over and over again
I think, the reason I had kinda gotten, not necessarily discouraged, but just bored with hip hop in general is because people don't like to take risks, they don't like to try anything different. And in order to really make any kind of impact these days, not just sales-wise, but just on the artistry, you gotta be able to go to the left and try different things. Sometimes you'll get killed for it and sometimes you'll succeed
But he was one of the few artists that was just willing to go all the way to the left with it. 
Like this Eternal Sunshine thing. I can't think of any other rapper that would even think to do something like this

I met Jay Electronica in Brooklyn. One obscure day, a friend of mine named 
SupaNova
 came over to the house and told me, this is the MC I've been telling you about. He let me hear him maybe a week prior to him coming into the apartment. I remember him coming into the apartment. I remember him taking off the shoes as everyone does. I remember him having on black socks, they were short socks, like Jordan socks or something like that. I remember him sitting on the futon and I was breast-feeding and I was very busy because I was also home-schooling and I was looking around for a place to sit my baby down, my 3, 4 month-old. I handed her to Jay and she rested comfortably there and that's how we initially met. 
And he and Seven, my son, became fast friends. They actually became friends before he and I became friends.
 That was the meeting and 
I remember after hearing his music I wanted to start a record label just on the strength of hearing him
Jay Electronica the person. 
I wouldn't even call him a person cause he's a weird looking cat. His ears are kinda pointy, he's got a square head. He looks kinda like he's a alien from somewhere really.
 But in a rare beautiful way, like some kind of mythical creature who would have a bow and arrow on his back and wings under that bow and arrow. He also has spirit to his look. He's very unorthodox in the way he treats people. He's peculiarly intelligent and makes you very curious and draws you in and as he stated before his masculine energy really draws in the female, or the feminine energy. Which makes me happy and mad
He's just very easy to fall in love with because he's such a protector. He's such a positive, in every kind of way if you will. He's a plus in this world. I think everyone he knows becomes dependent on him because he helps us to see who we really are",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-intro-lyrics

Spitting black magic
Create a world outta black fabric
Sparkled the life
Spark it with light
God stay visible
My du-rag create sound waves I'm Jay Pivotal
Spun the cypher running with Christ plus I'm a sniper
One with the dice one with the mics and nobody's nicer
I payed the price-ah
And now I'm heating up the rostrum
Sucker emcees get struck to they knees playing possum
Rap gods insane
Lyrical Messiah, Jesus baptized in a flame
Sanitize they brain
What's the origin
Ten thousand sons up in my squadron
We break down then build back up to form an organ
The flows natural
The inner-glow is celestial
The physical mold that's just the clothes for the astral
Extra-terrestrial
Emceeing supreme being
All eyes seeing
Master the seen and unseen
And what year was that when the atom was cracked
In the materials of darkness she laid on her back
She knows all about you
Because the womb of the mind is the wo-man
That x chromosome came up out you
My rhymes like sperm cells thoughts for tales
Reproduce like sperm whales sharks and snails
Hit your gray matter
Then they excrete the data
And gestate for nine months above the bladder
This the most mathematical style that you heard of
And every verse I spit bitch it kicks murder
And like Roberta Flack
I'm killing you soft
Drawing you up in the fire midst revealing your thoughts
When Allah and his Christ bust through the ceiling with hawks
In the face of the earth meet the tip of the drills with a spark
That's the judgement
Its grievous man

So I gave her a boat, and an oar
And a star to guide her safely to the shore
She said she'd never believe in Moses and Noah
Unless I show her, so I showed her
Gave it right to her like I owed her
That's when I changed from Shrek the ogre
Into Master Yoda

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a spherical

A hundred thousand views of me
Buildin' me a manor on the backs of wack rappers
Out here spitting that foolery
She logged on to Gmail, clicked compose
And said ""I don't do this usually
Nas said Hip Hop was dead
And what these niggas out here spitting is just eulogy
You represent the new to me, true, cats is nice
But I ain't see the God since Hova spit that navy blue to me
Truly yours, don't let me down like Lennon
The greats pay the sacrifice in they early beginnings
P.S., 'LL' rocked the bells, now it's your time
Your train is running on schedule, 'LOL', showtime
I hear your name ringing, I feel the game changing

It's like Rakim in his flag

Pawn to e-6 move, swift but cunning
Keep my knights on flank and my bishops gunning
My BL queen she hold me down lovely
The gravitational pulls too strong for you to budge me
It's a lyrical miracle
Pound for pound, syllable for syllable
I'm the unfuckwitable
Eighty percent of my life I was subject to ridicule
But it was the fuel that helped me to reach the pinnacle

Slayed crews
Did my share of dirt but never made news

 the god fearing zone rusher
Perform under pressure
Nobody's fresher, the soul stepper


Most of you lames never heard of me
I'm the Third Ward born phenomenon
Don Juan sporting the Burberry
Dipping in the flashiest car
In the mic booth spitting the rah wah
The blase blah
Blase splee
You might find me in the D
Gettin grimey with the D-A-M- to the E
Mr Porter in the lak
Black pearl in the back
Runyon Ave pack the loud gats that say sprrrraaat

With Freddy and Black Teddy just playin' a crap game
Smokin' on stank, sippin' on drank
When Brian came flyin up the block like batman

His wig got peeled in the Calliope
By some Tenth Ward niggas that we barely know!'
I said 'Hold up, whoa whoa whoa whoa
You must be jokin',' but he wasn't laughin'
Freddy passed out in the the grass and that's when
His mother came outside and said 'Where's Minnie?'
I looked down at the ground 'I don't know where he's at ma'am.'
Lump in my throat; I just lost my best friend
Connecticut Minnie with the East Coast accent
Top it all of, my older cousin Mookie got caught
With some yellow capped vials of crack, man

It ain't much left here to see for a black man""

Kiss my baby sister, tell her I'll be back

To have a shake and a roll of the dice g'yeah

I never knew that Mary'd put a hole in my fishing boat
I got to tripping more, she went to bitching more

Should I go should I stay and withstand
The additional attacks on the mental and the physical
It's gone get dangerous
Why waste time in these child-like exchanges
Why waste time with these child-like games, 
it's make up to break up
Crying all the time baby messing up your make-up
Try and scratch my face up
She said ""I need communication Jay but you dont say much""
I know it ain't okay but
I from where niggas keep they mouth closed and the gate shut
It seem like only yesterday that I was just a kid
In Christian Dior velour, ballies and a shape-up
Spinning on cardboard and trying to rip a break up
Life comes at you fast, I went from sleeping in class
To sleeping in the streets forgetting where I wake up
When I was hit with trial,
 
I went in to survival mode
And did a lot of shit a nigga wasn't proud of,
 
so
When I be sittin on the couch with a blankhead
I be at the homeless shelter jefferson and bankhead
A Jack sippin dankhead
Making sure niggas don't steal my clothes
Trying to make a path so I fufill my goals

Throw on some Atlantic
Starr, sippin on some glasses
Sit back relax watch time roll past ya
Now you caught up in the rapture
Better check the NASA, I'm out of this world
My dissertations be stumbling blocks with scholars at Yale
I had a double shot of Jack Daniels, no rocks with lemon
She said she could'nt trust me cause I know lots of women
""Plus, you might be too much with your alpha male syndrome""
Girl you something else with your caramel skintone
That Gucci got you feelin extra sassy
That Alexander McQueen is classy
How the hell you get pass me?
Well... I guess that's yesterdays mixup

To keep your mental eyelids closed and your eyeballs bulgin'
Fear, it could kill a man
Turn a real man to a realer man
Or package you
As a Bathing Ape wearin' gorilla stan
This message is brought to you in part from a Michael Jackson Thriller fan
I had the glove plus the matching jack, the zippers
It's cool to imitate, just grow into your own
Don't let the green grass across the picket fence
Turn you into Mr. Smith without a purpose or a home
Underneath he is a Jedi on the surface, he's a Clone
Smilin' for his peers but
At night time he cried til he dried up all his tear ducts

I'm sharp as a tack, I'm black and I'm feelin' alive
Señoritas on the floor three-quarters naked

I said, ""I don't know ma, lemme see I.D.""
Cause the truth is, she really wanna take me to the telly
Put my dick in her belly, then play me like R. Kelly
But I can't go for that, I'm on a mission
I can't put myself in that compromisin' position

Maybe a pat on the back or some dap when I'm finished

Get knocked the fuck out

We can get it crackin' any minute right now man; I'm ready for war
On the dance floor two-steppin' like Sigma Beta
With them down south head 'bussas knockin' out a hater
I mastered the dark side of the Force like Darth Vader

I'm a Third Ward soldier, I told you, playa
See the U-P-T and the clothes I wear
Out in that lower ninth ward they walk with a bop
Never caught without a Glock or a sock full of rocks
Shoutout to Big Reem
On his twenty-four-seven hustle to stack the green
Man, niggas got plans and dreams

Extended Control verse (performed in Miami),UnKnown,UnKnown,"{Verse 1: Jay Electronica]
Entirely off the record
The messiahs of society quietly walk with lepers
But when they plugged into the matrix
The babies have dreams of making love on a spaceship
You can hear atheist cries in the sub when the bass hit
My grandmother died last year and although i cried a lot
I thought about my sins and the demons of my past and the skeletons i hide
And all the things I lied about
And every line of coke and pub i sat and emptied bottles out
Tell me what's it all for
Coming down the next morning grovelling on all fours
It takes place in transit/
The story of Oz we know, takes place in Kansas
But when the picture's in black and white, we take things for granted
Signs on the highway, a stranger on the train
That tiny voice inside your stomach begging you to change
We on a non-stop voyage through space and time
I fall on my knees and pray to heaven that i stay sublime
Pigs look me up and down with a frown
Is it because I'm brown or is it because I'm from uptown
My life story is etched in the bricks of the projects
I'm everywhere but never expected like disc-shaped objects
Haters will never get it,  those thats in the know say I'm the greatest to ever spit it
But that's arguable, they all keep arguing
The deeper I go with the flow they all keep gargling
All the way to Parliament
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then rained on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turns the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spitting this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgeting with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock, then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
Cause I endured a lot of pain for everything that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rains from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissing you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight, passion of the Christ
Right, to basking in the limelight, it take time to get your mind right

He could make Rumsfeld resign with rhymes he never heard
Commune with the birds
And could manipulate matter with the usage of words

The sovereign nation of France was opening their files on the UFO phenomenon
I.E., spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack, may as well face it
Every rhyme I write a seal get cracked from the chapter of Revelations
A atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit
Call me Jay Dogon, I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder ""Why do he bust?""
Allah blessed me with the Midas-y touch
Everything I lay hands turn to Ethiopian gold, shiny and buffed
I got a firm understanding on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper 'bout how he ain't got rhymes that's fuckin' with mine
I'm trying to kill Lucifer
So if I have to break cause a rapper in my face tellin' me that he's the great
You can bet a shiny nickel I'll blast his muthafuckin' ass way past Jupiter

 Aztec lion, 
Asiatic black man from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltryptamine make a man dream

Blunts and cash
We need saving
Minds are consumed with swine
We need bathing
Go home, fast for three days, and reflect ...

That nobody in this world but God could console me

Keep your on eye on the sparrow and walk on the straight and narrow cuz'
Pride and arrogance will swallow you in Pharaoh's blood
Looks after your sisters, I'm here cause you and fal are blood

And if the shit hit the fan the quicksand will lather up

Memories of layin in the grass
My head was spinnin and my heart was beatin fast
I opened up and start relayin you my past
'Una Furtiva Lagrima' was on the box and merlot was in the glass
I must admit at first I focused on that ass
But then we chilled and had a blast
So the waves had to crash but the titans have to clash
We had a decorated pad just forgot to pump the gas

I had set the game a-blaze, and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel, where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where niggas cussed out the police and sold they're crack on

Nigga just wonderin' when
I'll get a chance to represent for the City Of Wind
Robert and Helen raised me, streets of the Chi made me
Doe like a pastry
Hungry niggas hate me
Fans at my shows and they souping me like some biscuits and some gravy
Long way from rhymin' and rappin' 'bout my Mercedes
DJ's played me, now they gotta play me
Sittin' in my room thinkin' I was goin' crazy
Waitin' for a label to decide if they wanna pay me
Swearin' I was Jay-Z
Took everything I had just to not get lazy
But I stood Firm like Foxy, Nas and AZ
Knowin' in my heart that my skills was impeccable
More than respectable
Good to get a check or two
Especially special over the bass and the treble
Sayin' I'm drivin' gotta put the pedal to the metal
So here we go with no further ado
Naledge the prince of the Chi, representin' for you",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-cool-relax-lyrics
Prelude to a Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I fell out the sky like baby Superman to a farm on kansas
Now the world wanna see my story all on camera
That’s magic, described by a hater, that’s tragic
Billy Shakespeare was in his grave doin backspins
The attractive power of every verse was so intense the ladies required napkins
The credits rolled: below average seemed lavish garbage ass rappers
With a gaudy no class chain and a fitted turned backwards
Black on black anti semite rap wazyap
I’m out that Nolia
 So niggas’ll surely clap if I ask em
Whip a nigga out his clothes from Freret to Jackson
Nobody’ll ever wonder or talk about what happened
C’mon son, who better than us? Them?
They ain’t even figure out they own style yet man
And every rhyme I ever spit out my face was spotless
Any bitch I ever said strip to got topless
Any click whoever said shit they got rocked
So sugar Shane Mosley yo ass up out the cockpit
We natural born fly guys
Twist up yo Garcia Y Vegas and toast to the wise guys
We made it to the high rise
Georgy and Weezy and Lionel and Jenny Kravitz
Jigga and J. Cole, Jay Electronica, magic
Jeeeeesus, uprisings in Egypt
The black Gods free up, the Land erupt
I hope one y’all is feelin me
Some of yall gotta wait til the final act of the trilogy to get it
Oh I get it, niggas wanna hear me spit it
But I never take shots without establishing pivots
Itsy bitsy spider climbing up the water spout
Moses with his rod hit the staff and got the water out
Powerful parables
I learned from the lips of my uncle Charles comin outta the VA like Clipse
Now there’s a whole wealth to dig thru
But yo shit it’s too shallow for me to dig you
Feel me, man these wack niggas kill me
The wordplay was sweet but the rhymes don’t thrill me
You lose, quit believing in the news

Defcon 4,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Upgrade to DEFCON 4
It's war with the dragon
10,000 zealots packed tight in a wagon
Aiming for the head of the beast with horns
Queen's knight to C3, son the beef is on
When I was a young buck my mom tried to school me;
""Son, I'm a angel, but the devil want to rule me
Hidin' in the bush trying to swallow my seed
Have patience, move cunning, never wallow in greed.""
Yes ma'am, when I make a big man
I wage war, settle the score
Revenge all the fathers of yore;
Got my mic in my one hand and sword in the other
Jay Electronica, The Lord of the Thunder
It's drama in the wilderness
I'm molding a way
3000 by 2000 square miles of clay
Babylon baby London, the dye is set
From the UK to USA, my death threat
Reign supreme, I leave cracked atom and found cream
Allah team convene over coffee and cream
These yellow-back rappers tuck tail and flee swiftly
Many men want to take my life like 50
But I push through the threshold and press to the death
Step by step I heal through bass and treble cleft
Its war with the dragon, man up and react
As I launch this nuclear attack on wax, motherfucker!",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-defcon-4-lyrics
Not A Disturbance,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Mic check one, bitches and drugs
I'll pop a hot slug in the back of a thug
My chrome rims is spin *blurts out*
Back to reality
These niggas gone mad with the fairy tale mentality
Bound by doubt I stood still in the mayhem
Relaxed all night and chilled in the AM
That's when I got a call from Sinister Sam, hello

Peace god it's me I just came home from
 
Matawan
I beat a charge down in Chevy Chase, Maryland
But when I came home I was faced with the case
With black chicken-head Stacey on the witness stand tattling
I tried to call you but Breezy told me to...

Take it easy homie you know these land lines is land mines
One step ka-BOOM... twenty years of man time

True indeed god I see your math you know they can't fade us
But don't stress

Nevertheless
I'm back from my hiatus

Good, niggas is in the background dying to know the status

Yeah I was out in Vegas
Me and Just Blaze politicking on the latest
I mastered both sides of the force like Darth Plagueis
Now I'm wildin' on you haters
Style Wars, Jay the greatest

Eternal Sunshine,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She said she never fell in love with a Superman
Christian, Muslim, Protestant, Lutheran
I told her that being a mortal is a portal
To the true nature of growth to the Christ like Buddha man
That's why I never spit the traditional garbage of a knife fight
Bright lights, white ice to the fans
The radio is just a stereo, like a house and a home
A chair is just a chair, ask Luther Van
Go to work; go to church let your dreams die
Bow tie, Final Call, and a bean pie
Yarmulke for Hanukkah, wish list for Christmas
This is the gist of the life that we lead, why?
So you can fit in, with the close minded in the sit-ins
And clothes lined in the ed-end
I could care less about a plaque and Benz
And get Punked on TV by my friends
Don't get a nigga wrong, I get tempted by the rewards
That all come along with nigga songs
But what does it mean if I'm a Muslim and you a Jew
And because of that alone we don't get along
And when you talk like this, and try to walk like this
The radio stations'll never put a nigga on
Just Mims, just 50, just Wayne, just Jeezy
Dem Franchize Boyz, and Jimmy Jones
F*ck that, f*ck rap this God-hop
King-dom mu-sic for the hard rocks
I'm a spit it till TRL get it and Hot97 hear the nigga with a bomb drop
Ask Flex, ask Slay, ask Who Kidd
Just blaze said Jay is the new kid
I took Eternal Sunshine and I looped it
No drums no hook just new shit
The handling of a heart's
A very delicate art
Cause it's paper thin
One irrelevant thought
That started out as a spark
Could be a poisonous dart
That leaves a permanent mark
That's ice cold in the day and burns in the dark
And makes you never wanna see her face again
Tee-hee what a place I'm in
Lead me to the sta-tio-n
A one way ticket, don't look back
One cold tear that frozen crack
A whole lotta pain I'm holdin' back
Sheriff said: ""Eff that, roll the sack""
I said: ""If my skull was cracked
And blood ran out to the cul-de-sac
That could not match me where I'm at""
My memories flash me there and back
Yup there goes me right there in black
Hold her hand stop starin' back
She starts cryin' I start denying, it's my fault
And I'm aware of that
Man, in hindsight signs be glarin' back
Wheres the map to show you where you're at?
I can hear the crowd yelling
I can smell the tire smoke
I can hear the starter pistol wheres the track
Ring no answer came home late
Jane told dick she had a date
But they was just chillin'
And at that moment the right brain says to the left just kill em
Make the headlines
Make the front page
Wild out in the court house man thrill em
They'll say: ""The boy dead wrong but I feel 'I'm""
Voodoo man, chicken bone chicken bone
I can make a thunderstorm from a light rain
My ears start ringing
My nose get bloody
I feel a little bit of pressure on my right brain
Intermission transmission
Put me in submission
Glistening trapped in the light prison whistling
The Christ told me come closer to the light man
I went blind woke up in front of a mic stand
Voodoo man, tap dancing in the French Quarter
Walking on water with a scroll in my hand
The blueprints for a disc shaped-like vessel
That was chiseled out of metal off the coast of Japan
Fasting on the top of a mountain I went to Tepoztlán
Saw a shiny object floating out of the ocean
I'm sort of like a postman
You can get the message if you want to understand
From the rap slumber man
Voodoo man, civilize the savage
Criticize the parish
Spreading false doctrine
Terrorize the cleric
For carrying on nonsense
Specialized lies to paralyze the conscience
Voodoo man, chit chatter
Abracadabra, spitting out matter
While I'm shitting out data
Mmm, chew 'em up shitting out rappers
Sipping Pellegrino while I'm giving out matches
Set yourself on fire
Let the wisdom of Elijah
Purify ya take a nigga higher
Sold your soul to the high-est buyer
Now you're on the wire
Talking about two-foot tires
Saying you sell crack
Clapping at cats with macs
But you a liar pants on fire
Same old rugged cross
Different crucified messiah
While you was blowin' X amount of dollars on a bracelet
The sovereign nation of France was openin' they files
On the UFO phenomenon: I.e. spaceships
It's just the facts, Jack may as well face it
Every rhyme I write the seal get cracked in the chapter of Revelations
An atom get cracked in the blackness of meditation
Mysterious shit, call me Jay Dogon I'm on some serious shit
Scholars wonder why don't he bust
Allah blessed me with a Midas-y touch
Everything I lay the hands turn to Ethiopian gold: shiny and buffed
I got a firm understandin' on the minus and plus
So I ain't got time to argue with a rapper
Bout how he ain't got rhymes
That's f*ckin' with mine's
I'm trying to kill Lucifer, so if I have to brake
Cause a rapper in my face
Tellin' me that he the great
You can bet a shiny nickel
I'll blast his motherf*ckin' ass way past Jupiter
You couldn't be stupider
F*ckin' with the nuc-u-lear
Mayan, Aztec lion
Asiatic Blackman from Zion
Quetzalcoatl supreme, lettin' off steam
Dimethyltriptamine make a man dream
But y'all would much rather hear me rappin' bout trash
The size of Erykah's ass, blunts and cash

Minds are consumed with swine we need bathin'",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-eternal-sunshine-lyrics

to spit the realest shit he ever spit
That cream vanilla folder in the limo with the president
That never say never whatever nigga rhetoric, Panoramic
Close-captioned, Fade to black, lights cameras action
Michael Jackson crying
Tears, sniffin' lines
Paramount declared it the movie of all times
The wolves stood in line twelve days to see blood
The ghost of Malcolm X came straight with the judge
Six-million Youtube views in six hours
The devil threw a hissy fit and blew down the towers
That's power
The I-M-F, Federal Reserve
Can't stop my Myspace from spreadin' the word
No record deal just hard ass rhymes
Turned poverty and heartache to nickels and dimes
I'm on fire like the pentagon hexes on the hecklers
Another rapper to me is a deathwish on the necklace
My shotgun go click-clack blast
I'm on a forty day fast, No cheese no grass

Untitled (Man Up),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called rulers, kings and presidents
Revolution is here, man, we're culturally wise
Elijah's pride, when I spit, I cause landslides
Rain, hail, snow and earthquakes break the states
George Bush lay and wait for the invasion date
We the quintessential soldiers, movin' in the Cobra
Cooler than the polar, elevate throughout the solar
System comes equipped with my lyrical staff
Pharaoh cast and I cast, free at last
Raise it in the green pastures, I can't lose
Wack rappers couldn't walk a fuckin' mile in my shoes
I carry my cross, been shot, burned, stabbed and hung
You's a jack of all trades but you mastered none
I mastered one, rap, that's it
Spit that hot shit, that's it, holla back, that's it

Now man up, man up
Go 'head, man up, that's right

When this shit gets rough, goddamn we man up

When the shit hits the fan, goddamn we man up

Meet Christ the Crusher, there ain't no stoppin' the king
Baby Paul, right now I'm on top of my game
I wreck cassette decks, blow spots like Waco, Texas
I might possess flesh but I'm ethereal, baby
And I drink by myself, think by myself
But when it's time for war, goddamn we man up
Then we give to you raw, shit, man, we clan up
Afghanian style, fam, we stand up
Get it crackalackin', I cut MCs so quick
Blood from their necks be drippin', but they be still rappin'
I'm razorblade sharp, darts, I throw 'em
Jay Electronica spittin' them awesome poems
Stand to you man, animals up to a perpendicular pose
I hit your clique with the potion 'til you froze
32 degrees, you can't breathe
Believe, all will lie Gs, but man up

Now man up, man up
Go 'head, man up, that's right
When the goin' gets tough
When this shit gets rough, goddamn we man up

These cats'll split your wig in the name of beef
But when the cops come they're runnin' and tossin' their heat
Is you a thug or a coward? It's time to rebel
If I don't get Jill by June, you gon' find me in jail
Rap is the ultimate weapon, we run the globe
I'm glad the God's Son beef is finally done with, Hov
Benzino on the battle with Em
But George Bush is fuckin' up the whole country, stupid, battle with him

So niggas go rob a liquor store to get em a chain
Shoot up a house party for nothin' to get em a name
Like convict, dope-man, oh that's them niggas
And if you think they're really happy go and ask them niggas
I promise you they lie
Position they fingers to throw they hood up in the sky
To tell you man look I

I'm from the same dark alley niggas never go down
Forty ounce glass needles on the merry-go-round
Look, abracadabra bitches
I ain't the average nigga yappin on a track for riches
Even though my rags to riches tale is vicious hell
A lot of niggas sick an pale when I spit the braille
You feel me?
I never, ever, ever slipped and fell
You hear me?
And any pussy that decide to try and come near me
Will get raped crushed and left for dead on the hill
I'll be on the pyramid stairs out in Brazil
Now put that in your pipe and get twisted
Make like fingerprints and get lifted
Nobody spit the sick shit like I do

I never ran ma'am
Well then you ain't a clever man Sam
Listen, the two faced king from Britain and Rome
Had a baby in the bush on the Grassy Knoll
Where they peeled back the orange head peel of a gnome
He said he emcee, I know you like killin' them
You terrorized the skies for twenty-five milleniums
Now you settin' fire to land
You the lion you the savior the messiah the lamb
You need backup he movin' on the youth at dawn
Call Badu and get Tyrone on the megaphone
Tell 'em I sent you and your codename is Megatron
If trouble come use your brain like a telephone
He'll take you to the Chocolate City
Where Two Face and the prince of darkness have they committee of snakes
Drill 'em, let the skin peel off to reveal 'em
Then spray 'em with them rhymes you like spillin'
Hit 'em up real real good but don't kill 'em
We only wanna burn 'em to the point that they willin'
To give the location of the blank faced villain
Who split atoms and give mushrooms to civilians
Hiroshima never recovered
And all the evidence was smothered
Under a thick cloud of rubble
The pope is his brother
The hillsides is his mother
The statue with the torch and steel eyes is his lover
She's a harlot, who stood still like time while New York turned scarlet
And the levee monster sucked up New Orleans
While they was playin' man verse man in Afghanistan
With they mind of Iran, Iraq and Sudan
Let 'em recruit you
He will try to use his powers to seduce you
Just let him think that the feelin' is mutual
'Cause if he found out that you already knew
The atom had a positive a negative and a neutral
He'll probably salute you
Then wait 'til you turn your back like a coward and shoot you
Man this shit is crucial...
Yea, you from the Third Ward right

Somethin To Hold On To,Style Wars EP,UnKnown,"As I scratch the last days of the calendar
Niggas roam the streets with heavy metal like metallica
Pistols with the silencers
Killin solidiers softly
The crime pays a little but the consequence is costly
My cousin, I love em we go back in the days
But now he struggle with the monkey and he trapped in a maze
I still care for him
To tell the truth I'm kinda scared for him
Cause when he conscience he in rare form
But that's the story of his life gettin locked up or shot up
Or in somebodys kitchen on the block cookin rocks up
I think he lost hope when he seen them lock his pops up
Or when he seen his sister baby father get his knot bust
My grandmother complain and tell him make a change
But her thinkin is outdated she can't understand the game
Shyeah, hard time three to nine in a jailhouse
Is no different from slavin nine to five in a warehouse

There's a lot of shit goin on up in my hood
I thank god I'm alive oh and I'm a knock on wood
Yea he go and walk through the valley of death
I know the lord got my back with every step
You see nothing here surprises me
I got a whole lotta soldiers down to ride with me
But lord please give me something to hold on to
Something to hold I need something to hold

Yo in projects shit is mad real for the youth
Niggas get I'll for the loot
The more guns ya buss the realer your crew
Cats carry gats concealed in they suits
Whether cee-loo craps or macks gorillas may shoot
When the eyes meet don't steer wrong and don't stare long
Cause niggasll kill for that when they be full of heron
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How crews remain standin once the AKs thunder under the 
stun
 roof tops
Career thugs cook rocks
Then hit the blocks
To make a killin plus fame
Man they lovin this game
It's mega action the trees stay hot like sonars
Shorties with fly hair-dos get dipped or play the corner
Summer time they shine block parties galore
So many soldiers die they buy a seperate forty to pour
I knew this kid Larry niggas thought he was poor
But he had cream for days ran a solid scheme with Ks
AKs with the banana clips, rubber handle grips
The same nigga that got Randal hit
He livin scandelous
He used to pop no-doz so he wouldn't be caught sleepin
And he could'nteven walk around the block cause he was beefin
I say that to say this
That's ghetto everyday shit
Where slugs miss chipped bricks leave scars on chicks
It's kinda trife right now
But that's the life right now
And way back it was a half assed trife like now

There's a lot of shit goin on up in my hood
I thank god I'm alive oh and I'm a knock on wood
Yea he go and walk through the valley of death
I know the lord got my back with every step
You see nothing here surprises me
I got a whole lotta soldiers down to ride with me
But lord please give me something to hold on to
Something to hold I need something to hold

Peace god what's todays math
To tryin to escape wrath
With two left feet, it's kinda hard to walk a straight path
Soldiers layin in gutters from god to greed
My old dad left momdukes and scarred his seed
We all family
But seemingly this cats can't stand me
Haters gunna hate be it a lexus or a camry
Understand me
But do the knowledge first swallow my verse
Which is my universe
God obeys no thirst
Fallen angels in the ghetto tradin in they wings for things
Semiautomatic machines with red beams
Street magicians convertin to crack and the cream
Sat back saw em turn black zack to a fiend
Hes a teacher
Had a fly daughter named lakeisha
If you hustle have a beeper smoke reefer ya can freak her
I seen her givin head inside the club behind the speaker
Last year she had three abortions for the preacher
And one miscarriage for this kid they call Harris
He told her that her loved her and hes moving her to paris
She fell for it
Touched her third rail for it (uh)
And next year she woulda been sixteen
Once told me that she wanted to go to god get clean
So she could be a role model for her brother Eugene
Hes a beautiful seed
Eight years and can't read
At night his ashtma so bad he can't breathe
He wants to be an astronaut
And fly to space but his teacher told him that he just ain't go what it take
So he cried while the other kids played at lunch break
What will it take to raise our mindstate

There's a lot of shit goin on up in my hood
I thank god I'm alive oh and I'm a knock on wood
Yea he go and walk through the valley of death
I know the lord got my back with every step
You see nothing here surprises me
I got a whole lotta soldiers down to ride with me
But lord please give me something to hold on to
Something to hold I need something to hold

Where, where, I come from an era where, the art of rhyming like, what you're saying
 
and even if you wanna, okay, let's say you just wanna talk about drugs and your chain, okay: back when 
Only Built 4 Cuban Linx
 came out, Raekwon and Ghostface, the whole album is drugs, chains, chicks, but it was also, they also had substance in there, too, you know, that was like social commentary too along with that.
 
But, the poetry of it, if you listen to Raekwon and Ghostface, it's like Fyodor Dostoyevsky, you know what I'm saying? The poetry of it",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-poetry-interlude-lyrics
Scenario 2004,Victory,2009,"Somebody stop me, lord I'm on fire
Sucker emcees better call me sire
I won't stop rocking 'til the moon retire
'Til the prophecy's fulfilled and the earth catch fire
Nope, I ain't trying to be going back into poverty
Working a nine-to-five and be hoping I hit the lottery
Nope, I came too far to turn back on my
Heels like a windmill and head back home-a
I eat a emcee up like Jeffrey Dahmer
Parlaying up in V.I.P. playing the corner
I'm hot like a sauna
I spit a hot shot off of the top you're a goner
Somebody call the coroner
These wack emcees is D.O.A
They label you as a hater when you see yo' way
But, if you don't give a damn we don't give a fuck
You can catch me in the Third Ward throwing it up
You might find me in the nine where they don't mind dying
Screaming five-o in the back of the line
Everytime that I fall up in the spot I shine
Heel up wheel up bring it back home rewind

Here we go yo, here we go yo
So what's the, what's the, what's the scenario

I just wanna keep the peace like a Buddhist
But niggas wanna kiss me on my cheek like Judas
Nigga, then lets do this
I leave em left out, left field, left clueless
They feed off of rumors 'til I hit em with the trueness
They don't hate me
They hate god I ain't make me
I'm just a little nigga on the mic with a breakbeat
What have y'all lames done for me lately
Nada, I keep on movin' and dont bother
The flow's H-2-O, they drown in the water
Step right up and come down to the slaughter
See me in the Third Ward, 6-4 Impala
Brush off my shoulder and pop my collar, holla
See I don't even walk like a pimp, talk like a mack all I do is rap

And if you don't have any of the above said material goods
Than you're inferior, chickens'll say your lame
Niggas'll rob a liquor store to get them a chain
Shoot up a house party for nothing, to get them a name
Black convict, dope man, oh that's them niggas
And if you think they're really happy go and ask them niggas
I promise it'll be a lie
Position they fingers to throw they hood up in the sky
To tell you man look I

Down in the Dirty we bout it and we ain't fucking scared
I got em shook from the jump, cuz I'm a soldier these niggas is yellow

On the grind all the time, load and stacking that scrilla
It's the South, man, we put the fucking ""g"" in gorilla
Uh, 
talk slick and get your neck slit quick
'Cuz Uptown niggas don't play that shit
And if you ready come get me, got a squad that's with me

About a fresh young nigga you know so well
It started way back in history
In that Third Ward Magnolia, yeah UPT
I was born in seventy-six, and raised in the eighties
Pops left when I was six, I was raised by ladies
Son of Marilyn, brother of Fal
I grew up one block over from the South
T.I. told me, ""Be Easy"" but I'm hungry as fuck
I want a house on the hill and some pump in the truck
Now I'm up in the club player setting it off
With a mic in my palm tight letting it off
Shorty, smiling saying I'm spectacular

She says she wanna show me something good after the show

Jay Electrolysis probing the globe like a geologist
Puttin' all of you pussies on display like gynecologists
Listen, I'm on a mission
Most of you niggas just spittin'
The wise comprehend the diction hypnotized with the rhythm
Lyrical circumcision toss the shmuck in the fire
Yeah your mans and them is nice but they ain't fuckin' with Sire
I'm a higher power devour all you idolaters
You Satan worshipers nation perverters thirstin' for dollars
Jay Coldplay putting the clock on your chess game
I'm a varsity letterman you a fresh-mayne
Every line of every verse of every song is a quotable
Catch me in Mexico meditating with Quetzalcotl fuckers
I'm raining fire on you lame suckers
My tongue is the burner the barrel the biscuit don't make me buck it sprat
I'm outta that mac I came into rap carrying the south on my back
And I'm ready to scriddap
It ain't where you from son it's where you live at
I'll never kiss another niggas bum to get me did-dap
I used to sip the coke and rum blowin' dime sid-dacks
But now I'm wagin' war with wicked men in high places
So what you sayin'
Yeah yeah uhh uhh
Fuck a hook
Yeah, things will never be the same after this one
Every page of my poetry's like a round from the clip
The mic is always in my holster right on top of my hip
Niggas get flipped
When the hollow-tips spit at they melons
You niggas is Missy Misdemeanor my niggas is felons holla'
Me and Big Dame Lord of the Rings the Twin Towers
Knockin' other motherfuckers out the ring like Apollo Creed
You wanna get bleed the blood run up
And get done up until sunup
Down south they call me white man cause I hang emcees
Get 'em open with ease
Then pick 'em off like fleas nigga please
You ain't go no ends in me casa

Still reppin' u-p-t what is you sayin'

It's not a op-tion I got Pac on
Makaveli the don bumpin' that 'Me
And my Glock' song, zone in
Like Robert De Niro I'm Ronin
Struck 'em up with the omen
From adolescence to grown men
Walk a mile in my shoes it proves you a soldier
I paid a lot of dues to prove to Jehovah
That I can carry the cross the castle the crown
Everywhere I roam is my home life's my battleground
Salahuddin Abdul Fard Muhammad
To come up by night ridin' Elijah the Comet (uh)
I cave chest in the brave chessman
Masterin' one twenty lessons is my profession
So get to steppin'
Or catch lead (Led) like Zeppelin

Check the solar commander
I'm light years off of the scanner
Satellite dishes and cameras a bad mamma jamma
The most thorough examiner
My microphone is seven thousand nine hundred and twenty six miles in diameter
The son of man
Son of *t man* from out Puran
Master the air in the land from here to Iran

Them Philly cats say ""I like that boy he raw but he thorough""

The kings return
Now where will you reside?
Run and Hide x3

Sentimental rain drops
The tears fall in increments
Like incremental pain drops
That wash away the stained spots
The Western World is just a hive of Scum and Villainy
That's why Superheroes wear disguises in trilogies
When the future is uncertain

Can You Feel It,The Awakening,2000,"It's real, you feel it
And my crew

Everybody witness the power as I reign supreme
I lay low in the cut then rise to the top like cream
I've been rhyming since the days of old
Since Christian Dior, velour waves and 
My microphone is my rod, my staff
Only God is my math
Meditate to escape Allah and his wrath
The  is a marvelous path, conquer my hatred
The sacred, tied to a pillow and stripped naked
The life and times of Christ, we cite it on mics
Magnolia street life, the limelight be city street lights
MCs mistreat mics, I burn 'em like Hitler when quotin' scriptures
Blast backs out, swallow the fruit and spew the trash out
Then I'm stuck here 'til I learn to say, ""Fuck fear""
And start buildin' for the children of the 17 plus 2 million
Chill on Mars, stealin' bars on paper for haters
Then return back to Earth in a very fine vapor

Jeri you are the one
The one that they'll see it
And now that you have come
We know they will feel it

Here in the form of Je'ri as can be
Singin' the song in a key that appeals to the babies
Singin' the song in a key that appeals to the ladies
Allah is a great chef and he filled me with gravy
Use the forces of nature just to kill me a navy
Resurrect the same dead men and build me a navy
How can he be so wise and still be a baby?
Cause I learned from the best, plus burned some of the best
It was all a dream like B.I.G. said in ""Ready to Die""
Like R. Kelly said, yo, I'm ready to fly
I'm the swiftest sharpshooter with the steadiest eye
Ain't no whack rapper out ready as I
Who been rockin' since the days of Rocksteady? It's I
Who been drivin' since the days of Fab Freddy? It's I
If you feelin' strong, cock rock, ready to try
I feel for you like Chaka Khan, I'm the don

Jeri you are the one
The one that they'll see it
And now that you have come
We know they will feel it",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-can-you-feel-it-lyrics

Whack niggas with that sleep rap and then woke up in trouble
You were cool ten years ago, you fucking lex bubble

Brand new tires, Rollin down the same old strip
New party same old chicks
I'm so sorry
If I don't look happy to be here
In your label office but they said I can't smoke weed here
Man fuck it I'm out black on
And I'm bout it fool
I got a studio in my house
Along with some the perks
That come with my work
Pretty twenty something sleeping in my Diamond Supply shirt
There is not a adjective to describe how I work
Hard is not enough brother I'm tougher
Whack niggas with that sleep rappin' and woke up in trouble
You was cool ten years ago you fucking lex bubbles, bubble
You gotta know when to hold em', know when to fold em'
Learn how to roll with the punches
Take em' to school give these niggas brown bag lunches
If it ain't the jets then it ain't nothing

Yo the king closed his cloak the set was overfull
Such a excellent moment, so emotional
He rushed out on the field, so devoted for
Final victory clutch they went postal cold
Glory overload, hold up hold my coat
Please remember this day
This changes everything we can do anything
Until you show anyway

My momma told me, ""Son, always call a spade a spade""
Be like Chuck D never be like Flavor Flav
But that clock around his neck is so fly
And the way he complimenting Chuckie with that bow tie flow
Make me feel high so I'm gon' spit it my way
Excuse me as I do me cruisin' rudely down the high way
I'm young, black, intelligent, elegant, blasÃ©
Back to the thesis
Back to to shooting kraps and talking smack to the polices
Back to black and gold ballys
Dickes with the creases
Pulling youngins by the coattails
Schoolin' em' who the beast is
I pray this flow is dumb enough ugh
I pray my heart is DMC and Reverend Run enough
Cause I'm a throw my number up
I'm a throw some chicken bones and feathers on a hundred bucks
And summon up the thunder what?

Exhibit C (Clean),Exhibit C - Single,2009.0,"Hey!
It's coming
Ladies and gentlemen; this time around
The revolution will not be televised
Woo! As we proceed!
To give you what you need!
'09, mother—!
Get live, mother—!
Ladies and gentlemen of the court
In the hearing against The State of Hip-Hop vs. Jay Electronica
I present: Exhibit C

When I was sleepin' on the train
Sleepin' on Meserole Ave out in the rain
Without even a single slice of pizza to my name
Too proud to beg for change, mastering the pain
When New York ****** was calling southern rappers lame
But then jacking our slang
I used to get dizzy spells, hear a little ring
The voice of a angel telling me my name
Telling me that one day I'ma be a great mane
Transforming with the Megatron Don, spittin' out flames
Eating wack rappers alive, shittin' out chains (Woo!)
I ain't believe it then; *****, I was homeless (Uh huh)
Fightin', shootin' dice, smokin' **** on the corner
Trying to find the meaning of life in a Corona
'Til the Five Percenters rolled up on a ***** and informed him:
""You either build or destroy, where you come from?""
""The Magnolia projects in the 3rd Ward slum""
""Hmm, it's quite amazing that you rhyme how you do
And that you shine like you grew up in a shrine in Peru"" (Ooh!)
Question Fourteen, Muslim Lesson Two:
Dip-dive-uh, civilize a eighty-five-uh
I make the devil hit his knees and say the ""Our Father""
Abracadabra, you rocking with the true and living
Shout out to Lights Out, Joseph I, Chewy Bivens
Shout out to Baltimore, Baton Rouge, my crew in Richmond
While y'all debated who the truth was like Jews and Christians
I was on Cecil B., Broad Street, Master
North Philly, South Philly, 23rd, Tasker
Six Mile, Seven Mile, Hartwell, Gratiot (Oh!)
Where ****** really would pack a U-Haul truck up
Put the high beams on, drive up on the curb
At a barbecue and hop up out the back like, ""What's up?"" (Buh!)
Kill a *****, rob a *****, take a *****, bust up
That's why when you talk the tough talk, I never feel you
You sound real good and you play the part well
But the energy you givin' off is so unfamiliar
I don't feel ya (We need somethin' realer! Ooh!)

Nas hit me up on the phone, said: ""What you waitin' on?""
Tip hit me up with a tweet, said, ""What you waitin' on?""
Diddy send a text every hour on the dot saying
""When you gon drop that verse? *****, you taking long""
So now I'm back spittin' that heat, could pass a polygraph
That Reverend Run rockin' Adidas out on Hollis Ave
That FOI, Marcus Garvey, Nikky Tesla
I shock you like an eel, electric feel, Jay Electra
Oh my God! Keep going!

They call me Jay Electronica—**** that
Call me Jay Elec-Hanukkah, Jay Elec-Yarmulke
Jay Elect-Ramadan, Muhammad as-salaam-alaikum
RasoulAllah Subhanahu wa ta'ala through your monitor (Ooh!)
My Uzi still weigh a ton; check the barometer
I'm hotter than the motherfucking sun; check the thermometer
I'm bringing ancient mathematics back to modern man
My mama told me, ""Never throw a stone and hide your hand""
I got a lot of family, you got a lot of fans
That's why the people got my back like the Verizon man
I play the back and fade to black, and then devise a plan
Out in London, smoking, vibing while I ride the tram
Giving out that raw food to lions disguised as lambs
And—by the time they get they seats hot
And deploy all they henchmen to come at me from the treetops
I'm chillin' out at Tweetstock, building by the millions
My light is brilliant

Woooo!
I rest my case
'09, Act 3
First chapter of the end
The last chapter of a new beginning
If it's so
The things we do without even trying...
Be better than a lot of y'all records, don't get mad
Morning after, world premiere
Me!
For real, though?
I ain't even gon' say nothing
Matter of fact; I ain’t saying—
I don't even know why I'm sayin’ this
Jay, you should get Puff to do this over
We moving out, onto the next record
And, um, I'ma let this just ride
Ride, ride, ride

Unreleased Snippet,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I tarried through the turbulent month of Ramadan sweatin all through the night just like the holy prophet
Then reappeared on the stage in BK with the Ummah
Shoulder to shoulder with Jay Cole and Kweli
Just before Jay-Hova The God crowned me the King with his Golden locket
Alhamdulillāh
, We've come really far, ain't it?
The little engine who could, can power any car, can't it?
The Mothers in Chiraq said the murders getting burdensome
The cries of the despised was heard flying out of Ferguson
The last days and times, the Holy Quran and bible we on the last page and line
The verse with all the babies dying
Outside of the Matrix, outside of the spaceship
But the saviour's blind
Or so it seems
Years after Noah was told he would row a stream
The heavens bursteth then the rains came
Retaliation for the sons of the fathers who work the chain gangs
I hit that Shmoney Dance on the coffin of a crooked cop
In a Worldstar society where all we do is look and watch
No intervention
Policemen beating elderly women with evil intentions on the highways and the byways
The police state has spreaded to the backstreet and to the driveways
Officer Friendly is an enemy now, looking at me sideways
Shit was all bad just a week ago
The view was just as sad just a peep ago
The cries of the Asiatic Ancient Semitic Peoples
That propel Jay Elec from the pedestal to the steeple",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-unreleased-snippet-lyrics
Exhibit A (Clean),Exhibit A - Single,2009.0,"And his own story was as curious as his narrative
The tale of his life is the tale of a writer of incredible vision
An astute analyst and pundit
A lyricist compassionate and callous
A reckless hedonist and disaffected malcontent

I spit that, Wonderama ****, me and my conglomerates
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest ****
Get that type of media coverage Obama get
Spit that Kurt Vonnegut
That blow your brain, Kurt Cobain, that Nirvana ****
Who gon' bring the game back?
Who gon' spit that Ramo on the train tracks?
That gold rope, that five-finger ring rap, running with my same pack
You can find the Christ where the lepers and the lames at
Life is like a dice game
One roll could land you in jail or cutting cake, blowing kisses in the rice rain
Nice whip, nice chain, a closet of skulls
The stench is like slave blood at Providence Hall, yeah
They built my city on top of a grave
***** die, a nigga get high and watch the parade
Back in the early '90s, where they at, where they at
Get the gat, get the gat was a popular phrase
Bally Animals and Rugbys was a popular craze
This the vivid memoirs of a obnoxious slave
I pave ways like Nat and Harriet
I blast on Judas Iscariot and peel off in the chariot, uhh
I'm sitting pretty, spitting flames, gripping grains
Ain't a damn thing changed

How does he do it?
My dear boy, do you ask a fish how it swims? (No)
Or a bird how it flies? (No)
No siree, you don't! They do it because they were born to do it
What you are witnessing dear friends
Is the most enormous miracle of the machine age
Behold! A confectionery behemoth!

They say Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream
Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream
Knock a man's house down and build a casin'
A two thousand dollar government check from FEM'
I swam down ***** creek and came up clean
With a new lease on life like Andy Dufresne
It's the most poetical, Nat King unforgettable
Clarence 13X Allah's rhapsody from Bellevue
I'm splitting atoms, spitting flames
Bringing change, things will never be the same
I got the rap game singing At Last like Etta James
Lames get they plane shot down like John McCain
It's a dream, it's a dream
The flow is elegant like Miss Coretta Scott King
A lot of kings seen death and turn queen
Crack they twenty-four-inch rims in the ravine
Respect the architect, never test the Elohim
Goodnight, this is Jay Elec, live from New Orleans

My journey has brought me to an understanding
Of the divine forces which we have all been bestowed
It was in this search that I came upon a revelation
Which has called me to guide millions of people towards their righteous destiny",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-exhibit-a-clean-lyrics

See I need that other chromosome to master the land
Yo, I really love you more than you seem to know
Far from mediocre, glad I seen the glow
A vanguard with a mission give me piece of mind
I don't need to roam around in the streets for mine
Perfection, that's something we gon' reach with time
Parlay in range rover seats reclined
Sometimes you make me mad but I learn to get over it
It's the first time I had struggles I had to be sober with
Islam cleaned me up but you the finishing touches
Came a long way from nickelback, Guinness and duchess
I love you like a mother, a sister and a wife
You gave the great gift of all love
I give you my life

The slangs and slurs the ??? and the fly proverbs
Yo my mind detect that shit was ready I reflect
So I struck her with the sunshine made her spin one time
She love me I love her back, it's actually facts
Let's count stacks turn out parents to grand-parents
We could travel the seas and spark plus degrees
I spread love cause lust is just disease
Let me bless with good home and luxuries
You can have anything if you just believe
You can have everything if you just believe
You can have whatever you want, just believe

Yo, you can have my last name if you master the pain
We can fast, we can pray, we can master the rain
We can cry, we can laugh, we can master the brain
We can give birth to God and leave this plane
Yous an angel, I wonder how you hide those wings
I used to see you in my dreams fly marvelous queen
Allah's daughter, your eyes sparkle just like quater

""Centuries ago, words were written to be a call
And a spur to the faithful servants of Truth and Justice:
Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valor
And be in readiness for the conflict;
For it is better for us to perish in battle
Than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altar
As the Will of God..."" -- Winston Churchill

Uh-huh, you know the story where real see real we recognize
When you see the steel flash, you petrifies
Steve Jobs seen death after just retiring
Takes vision to build, God bless the dead

Shit, niggas know the +Sunshine Eternal+/son shine eternal
I burn slow like Disco Inferno
Burn slow like blunts with yayo, uh

Tell the Minister to tattoo the Qur'an on me
Before the men in black try to pin a crime on me
And Rupert Murdoch and his goons get to lyin on me
...The Lord is my shepherd

Me and Jay biz, green gettin twist
Kids goin to school, we still on the bench
Early morning yawnin, no sleep, just this
Hardcore rhymin like a diamond when I spit
Come hell or high water, we gon' make it out the bricks
I done graduated gladiator school, what's next?
From the bottom, only one way to go to the tip
Of the top, with these nonstop flows I invent
Bars so hard, shit hurt when it hit
My bars like prison bars, I'm trapped in the pens
Of this wildstyle hip-hop' the fuckin strongest

Pack my bags, headed for Greyhound, it was a Monday
Time to start my mission
I felt that burning feeling in my soul, I had to listen
I had this reoccurring dream from the stage and the suit with a fade
I had set the game ablaze and they threw me a parade
I stacked a little change and took my family out the caves
But I was trapped in a maze like a lab rat
And at the bottom of the barrel where they keep the crabs at
No Geico, no Aflac, nothing to fall back on
But the streets where niggas cussed out the police and sold their crack on
Better known as back home, where they treat the Arabs and the Spanish and the blacks wrong
There he go with that song, you may be tired but I spit what I'm inspired
From the Lord of the worlds 'cause the Devil is a liar

Say, say..
I've seen the lightning flashing (yes, I did) and I've seen the thunder roar
But you can't (you can't keep me down for long) 'cause I'm getting stronger

My style is like a shot of Jack Daniels, a baby grand piano
Lightening Hopkin, smokin' cigs, strummin' on the banjo
The son of man's the son of a gun with hella ammo
Sheriffs shootin' Bob Marley, John J Rambo
Six sextillion, 19 million, the holy pyramids say we all Allah's children
Voodoo for the pilgrims who bring weapons and conceal them
They silence you with force and then indoctrinate the children

But I'm a die for the christ

Roll with a thousand soldiers like jeremiah

Build my empire in the midst of the fire
Voodoo men say that I am I'm a stumbling stone
I'm never too far from home cause the earths my throne

Go get seven other cornballs who think they can rhyme
Itll take seven more befo I go for mine

Don't feel this

The god Je'Ri goes clean off of the edge
My life is like a movie, spit a scene off of the head
Agents in the temple make obscene offers to feds
I run up in they cypher if it seem off of they fez
Style holding my square 'cause if I lean off then I'm dead
Spit a hot shot and leave your team awfully red
Club promoters that'd see me gleam off of me bread
The leprechauns left the party cream offer me bed
Allah team convene over cream coffee and eggs
Building and atoning, We live for the moment
At times I kick back and shed tears when I'm zoning
Flowing in the whip shifting gears when I'm rolling
I shook off my kirch struggled years with the omen
Emcees that come near catch a severe microphonin'
I came along paying dues and such
Biting emcees and whack rap crews get touched
You ain't got a lot of heart, but my crew's too rough
Yo a lot of false gods got drove when we arove
Hardy heartless record execs offer me gold
This world nailed Je'Ri to the cross, but he rose
With all power
Switching the game cause it's all sour
Thugs claiming they thugs, but they all cowards
Wisen up young bucks, you out of touch with reality
And that can only lead to fatality

Same old scenario niggas, but the scary old niggas
Got shit twisted up to reality and illusions and mix it up
We fallen and forgotten how to get back up
And in turn react up, cats on this block be like actors
Like we ain't got to suffer consequences of sabbath's actions
Everything we do should be totally intact
That's why the fuck that you laughin'
I speak with urgency cause this nonchalancy doesn't servin' me
This is an emergency

I knew this kid Jack, he was nimble also pretty quick
Used to hustle off his powder bags on African defith
A faithful blackstone, busting at the GDs, the GP
Locked up every other week and phoning home, like E.T
Jill paid his bail, you know the one who do nails?
Were in the back of the shop, you get the burnout on your cell
Yeah, she dig me, I met her once before inside the fig tree
Before it was the spot where all the undercover pigs be
But back to the subject, Jack they called a menace to the public
Cause he was on some thug shit, you loved it
Whipping let the slugs drip and blood drip with tight crews
But he was on some Tom Cruise shit
Back at school, went to college on a scholarship
I don't know what happened
Two years later out of school, now he's clappin'
Strappin' macs trapped in a world of dissatisfaction
Slippin' and blastin', gettin' lost in the mister action
A victim of the system, a waterless sea
Yo his cream-lusting heart grew harder with greed
He was a wild style child, busting guns was his steez
Outside of his girl and his seed he didn't care who else bleeds
But one day Jack decided to retire from gun play
Didn't wanna see the graveyard where all his thugs lay
Dying young, Jack didn't want to hear that
But what goes around knows exactly where you live at
About a month later Jack got his life right
And he and Jill took his son to the park one night
It was the first time his seed was standing up for him
And then this 'round-the-way kid ran up on him
And said, ""Yo cousin', I got plans for you""
Cause my moms OD'ed at the hands of you
Cocked his shit back, hit two at his seed
Block the shit back
Until this day, Jack the nimble never forget that
The moral to this story is not that hard
You go home and figure it out

Death - we laugh at that
You niggas sweeter than the cog-ni-ac
I never sleep and when my eyes is closed
I'm in the deep battle for sheep. I'm an insomniac
And when it comes to the rhymes, a hypochondriac
The flow so sickly, splash a hot round on me
Peel off quickly. luckily
Now one of you niggas could f*ck with me
I'll hit you with a plus degree
Mind detect mind, plus mind detect matter
With that I say peace to the g.o.'s
And all my niggas locked away in cages, giving shit to the c.o.'s
Doing long stretches on the track
Cause they fell into the trap of the Neo's
The Farrakhan of rap, giving dap to the people
Busting shots out the eagle
With the arrows in it's talon, sneaking shots when you peep through your peephole
Spit the abracadabra, manipulate matter with a black magic created to eradicate evil
So if they call me a rapper, okay yeah I can dig it
But if they bring me before the congress, then I can kick it
I send the devil to hell every time that I get wicked
I get to ayosorabasura yeah I get lifted
One for money, two for the pussy and fame
Three hundred'll go to the court to change my name
Like cassius. the past just show me lessons
Stay on my grind and pray that time will show me blessings

Where dice rollers and heroin addicts is role models
So I had no choice but to kick it to full throttle

Now, either you with me or you with me
Cause even if you against me, running with my enemies
They ain't nothing but mini-me's
That I created long, long ago
And they only want to cut off
My lineage like the kennedys
That being the case
You should be aware I blast many a face
And left niggas displaced like Katrina did
And gave them very little with nothing like FEMA did
And I ain't never seen a bid
Well, there was one time when me and ali tussled with one-time
For claiming our sovereignty as a nation and bloodline

Because the seen leaves scars
It dance like the stars
My ears went ring-ring
Incoming message from Supreme Being
Then light provoked my body
I'm drifting off, I'll have a heart attack probably
I'm lifting off, beam me up into the cockpit
Swift and soft, I can't see the pilot
Man, it must be heaven, it feels like heaven
A real bright presence carried me home
Swing low, sweet chariot
I'm married to the throne
I'm carrying my cross with a crown full of thorns
? 20 miles from Atlanta
Please rain down ?

They promised not to harm me
A beautiful woman with hair wrapped around her body
Tucked in her garment
Led me to a room with a view for observation

I stood in a trance with a feeling of elation
Crying his eyes, this is what he said
""America, America, how great thou art
Oh, why did you have to go and break my heart?""
I couldn't understand, I said ""I don't comprehend""
Then we flew to an island off the coast of Japan
He took me by the hand, and showed me things
I got dizzy as the info overloaded my brain
He said, ""in 1909, construction began
With the wheel shaped airplane that's built like a planet
A few years before the federal reserve went off the gold standard
The wheel went up
Then the stock market crashed and the seal went up
This is 1929, the deal was up""",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-closer-encounters-unreleased-lyrics
Googly Eyes,UnKnown,UnKnown,"She said ""Jay I'm yours
I've been screamin for the past 3 days, I'm hoarse! ""
She was spinnin like she ain't never seen waves before
So I gave her a boat, and an oar, and a star to ride
Safely to the shore
She said she never believed in Moses and Lore
Unless I showed her. So I showed her
Gave it right to her like I owed her
That's when I changed from Shrek the Ogre into Master Yoda
She said ""Oh I, can't believe it, it's a miracle! ""
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a spherical object
Hovering hi-tech right out the projects
He can move mountains without flexin his bi-cepts
He speak a strange dialect
I start droppin jewelry
Her eyes went googly, she went home and Google'd me
MySpace, Friend Requested and YouTubed me
A hundred thousand views of me
Buildin me a castle on the backs of wack rappers out here, spittin that foolery
She logged onto G-Mail, clicked Compose and said
""I don't do this usually
Nas said Hip-Hop is dead and what these other niggas spittin is just Eulogy
You represent the truth in me, true
Cats is nice but I ain't seen the god since Hova spit that baby blue to me
Truely yours, don't let me down like Lennon
The greatest paid they sacrifices in they early beginnins
P.S. LL Rocked the Bell, now it's yo time
Your train's runnin off schedule, LOL Showtime
I hear your name ringin, I feel the game changin
Niggas know, every rhyme you spit
Is like Rakim in his flags
Spittin flames with his chain danglin
Barack Obama with his dame way out in Maine wranglin
The game'll swallow you if you ain't strong enough to make it follow you
I'd pack my bags and head home if I was you.""
So salute to the most honorable
MC, Abombinable

Twitter Rant,UnKnown,2014.0,"And i don't respect no so-called thug that will kill his brother for little or nothing but submit to these crooked ass police
Your gun don't really go off. only against your own brother who is in the mud like you. coward
""thugs"" and ""goons"" walk past george zimmerman everyday. why he ain't get his head bust yet?
If you can't relate to what I'm saying, I'm not talking to you
Whats sad is pp will fight or oppose you if you dabble in this kind of talk.. 
but they won't fight the school for teaching the babies lies
They won't fight the banks for stealing their homes or the fda for approving poison to be fed to the ppl
How i say it may not come out right, but you motherfuckers know what I'm saying, and those that pretend they don't are just pretenders
Everything is pretend these days. every fucking thing
Its like ppl have abandoned there inner constitution for turn up kits and social networking hype. No one is a standup guy anymore?
Rant over. you can go back to listening to your favourite artists tell you how much you're not shit and make you feel bad for not having
Turnupturnupturnup welcome to the fucking circus
And w all of this bullshit in circulation in the art industries, I'm starting to think some of these ppl are fucking CIA
These artists bloggers journalists label execs radio programmers are acting like fucking CIA operatives. What is your purpose?
And if this doesn't apply to you then it doesn't apply. shut the fuck up

Format,The Awakening,2000,"And it's time to flip to some old gutter shit
I'm ten toes down in this
Ten years ago, I hung around cliques scared to spit
It's funny how things switch, 'cause now I can't quit
Niggas hoff this game for luxury, but it's still love to me
You can believe what you want to believe, but we do it the realest up in this industry

Freestyle For Stay Dougie,UnKnown,UnKnown,"In hollywood everybody got a business card
In manhattan everybody got a business card
In new orleans... everybody got a gun, and a bible, and a net, or some type of a fishing rod
And at night, if you listen hard
You can hear gunshots from blocks away or fiends pushin bricks through cars
I'm from the same dark alley niggas never go down
Forty ounce glass and needles on the merry go round
Look, abracadabra bitches
I ain't the average nigga yappin on a track for riches
Even though my rags to riches tale is vicious hell
A lot of niggas sick an pale when I spit the braille
You feel me?
I never ever ever slipped and fell
You hear me?
And any pussy that decide to try and come near me
Will get raped crushed and left for dead on the hill
I'll be on the pyramid stairs out of Brazil
Now put that in your pipe and get twisted
Make like fingerprints and get lifted
Nobody spit the sick shit like I do
The bayou kid so deep on google you need goggles
Nigga I'm sick with this
I'm castin spells on the judge and the jury and the snitches in the witness pit",https://genius.com/Jay-electronica-freestyle-for-stay-dougie-lyrics
Putting Numbers Up (Unreleased),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm flying high in a rocket ship
Diesel kicks  slicks, I'm riding fly in a stocking kit
The moon was full- the wolves out howling
The hyenas is out prowling by the thousands
The house is mine but right now I'm browsing
So these raps is just traps to catch a mouse in
The track is peanut butter
The metal latch will snap when the rapper surface out of the gutter
Necks; I'm comin' at em
This is a battle between the Son of Man and Son of Adam so now my Atom I spit
Splitting half, the blast- release gas and fire to turn my feet and ass to burnished brass
My eyes get blood shot red, my waves start spinning
This is how I begin beginning, and how I end the endings
It takes place inside the womb of women
So every time God step inside the room they grinning

Whoever want it can come and get some
Niggas is sick when they learn the spit was from below the Mason Dixon
That niggas sick son
I blast passed you in the lac, with  in the back
Waving two fingers out the window like Nixon
I'm so sexy, you can Malcolm X me or Joe Tex me
Listen, I'm raising hell as I tarry the Earth
Mama, don't cry, just let the trumpets blow
And throw a bag of rice on my coffin when I marry the Earth
I'll be back in 76 in 76, rockin' the rugby hat and heavenly kicks
This is my manifesto
Most of these rap guys is trash like Vitali Klitschko
I reign supreme from the get go
Burn up the stage clutching my dick so they know who the man rapping
I scuffled my way to the top from Manhattan to San Fran scrappin

Jay Electronica baby
Rap son of man

I worked too hard to get it
Whether its 16 bars
Or ayah and surahs and spit it
Delivering more goals like Riddick
Spit the acidic acidic through your fitted
This unorthodoxy, got me
Knocking wack rappers outta the box like Rocky
This flow's approximately half mile by half mile
Hovering over your wack sytles
Phenomenal astronomical
I discovered this style a long time ago
These corny emcees God, we running em
They picking and rolling we hard warning em
Through the shirt behind the back bop the last beat
Damn, my man’s awfully nasty
Put pressure on they backs like Bush
And when is time to stack chips, we push

Fill me up with a heart of gold
Can you work on my remote control, lady
Girl you know I go hard like a robot
Fill me up with a heart of gold
Can you work on my remote control, lady

Girl I know you know I go hard like a robot
Trying to shine light in the dark like a low watt
I come from a poor block
Hoes in the screen door with bricks for a dough stop
The hot boys sold rock
My grandma told me never never ever talk to no cops
That’s right I ain’t have no pops
And I ain’t never learned how to love watching Oprah
We was at the cornerstone whistling at the girls with their shorts and their skates every time that they rolled by
Don’t ask me if I know why
Some say it’s environment
Some say it’s just pimpin never goes into retirement
Some say it’s the system just conditioned in our minds
Through the chicken and the swan
While we’re rolling through the drive in
Now I’m just a tin man
Put a little oil could you please on my tin can
My neck and my back and my knees and my shin ma'am
Thank you kindly, please let me be mindly

Girl you know I'm cold like a robot
Fill me up with a heart of cold
Can you work on my remote control, lady
Girl you know I go hard like a robot
Fill me up with a heart of gold
