BLEACH,SATURATION III,2017.0,"Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run

Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

They said “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?""
Or ""Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?""
Or ""Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame

Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)
[Bridge: Joba & 
Kevin Abstract
]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah

You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you

Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other

I'll take that if that's all you askin' for

Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for

Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for

I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (
Howl!

In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (
Haha!

Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (

Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

The original lick-splickety, 
higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, 
master with no limiting
Making 'em say ""ugh!"",
 they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey-butter
Bodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honey-butter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can

Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
""You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street""
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know

Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

Twistin' me up like licorice

Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel on the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters
'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight

JUNKY,SATURATION II,2017.0,"Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith

I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
""Why you always rap about bein' gay?""
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack

I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
(Go 'head, now)
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
(Go 'head, now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
(Go 'head, now)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer (Merlyn, Merlyn!)
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (Again)
When I cut the veil, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on Atlanta

Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, ""why?""
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'

I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk, that want it ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like (""Just the tip!"")
And yeah you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say ""Why not?""
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Timing all fucked up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, ""Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-junky-lyrics

I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the wood
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires

Sunsets to blood moon horizons

Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face

How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker,
 
they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
""We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter""
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments

Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me

Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh

It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you

What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could

Tell me what you're waiting for, huh

I need a friend (I need a friend)
And you need a home (You need a home)
I love when you come (I love when you coming)
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sunrise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed, I wake up in a cold sweat

Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for

Tell me what you're waiting for

Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer

""oh my god""
Make me sweat like 
exercise
, double up, 
milkshake and fries

I heard a call from the mountain top: ""Joba!""
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
Like 
la, la, la, la

Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie

And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells

Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try

Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows‚ truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high‚ expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)

How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-dearly-departed-lyrics

I could've got a job at McDonald's, but I like curly fries
That's a metaphor for my life, and I like taller guys
Could've got a deal if I wanted, but I like owning shit
And I like making shit, and I like selling it

Could've peaked when I was in high school, but I had bigger plans
Could've took the time out to find you, but you ain't understand
You don't gotta leave for them to define you, 'cause what could you demand?
When everybody out to define you without a circumstance

Anybody got Harry Styles' phone number?
Okay, I called him and they said I got the wrong number
I was tryna be Pac when I was younger, dreaming of better days
I don't see my mom no more, remind me of bad weather days

If you got a problem with me, try some other guy
I let you know I'm a dog, I eat the cat alive
But really, though, I'm alone, 'cause I don't stick around
And yes, I know it's my fault, so put your finger down

I would keep this shit pent up if it weren't for my mom
If it weren't for Dijon, yeah, I don't like to lie
Guess it sounds out the month
Should've opened up my mouth more, show 'em what my fist for
Let 'em get a fistful, caught up in the lust, man
Bred from the legs of straight killers on best end
Black eyes, bloody sheets, damn, where yo' feet stand?
We should get a new plan, maybe some more fans

I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie
I love it when the people go wild for me

And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend

I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
My life ain't been the same since my dog died
Since my girl left
I quit drinking and drugging and still can't get ahead
Been at a loss for words
It seems I'm destined to fall apart when I'm depressed
It's all a test, scream at God from my bedside
I glue my hands together, life's got me hog-tied
There's no applause in the game of life, I just bought a car
And a new house, here's the cost to prove it
I spin a little wheel when I'm feelin' moody
And that's like all the time, try not to mind the clock
Because my heart is ticking, I smoke a pack a day and
I wish I didn't, having some trouble quittin'
I have a couple vices, we had that show on Viceland
I was hardly in it; most the time, I'm hidden
Anxious, impatient and always wanting something different
I hate the way I'm feeling, I'm sick of chasing feelings

Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment

Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me ""Decapitate everything for what it's worth!""
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping

Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll

Them gold chains turn your neck green, bye

Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible

Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

Took the drugs that I wanted, which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

Ojalá pudiera rendirme pero tengo que seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos

I hate the separation, first thing they called me; ""Nigga""
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him

I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second-guessing my decisions, Black bodies come up missing

I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost

I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family

What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said ""Study or get that cash""
Mommy said ""Your career ain't gon' last""
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

I will
I will
(I don't matter)
I will
(Ahh)
Can I tell you how?
Can I tell you now?
I will",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-tonya-lyrics

Do you see what you contribute to my consciousness?
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break what's monotonous

How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight-track I stole from my grandmama

Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic
But instead I'm always babbling
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend
Every tour is like a catfish

I know how that feels

Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
'Cause my president was Black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola, ah—
(
Gimme that mic, nigga

I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits, ain't no
Ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms
 (Hahaha!)
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up
 (Shut up, nigga!)
They throw me in the crowd and tell me ""Boy, I'd lose that smile""
But see I got it from my dad and that's the reason why we had
I raise my black fist, I got big lips
I'm strong as Samson, they cut my fucking locks
I lose my fucking strength

Fuck, I'm running out of zips
My life been feeling tense, I won't be on the fence
I put my phone on airplane mode 'cause I'm on autopilot
I need a lot of patience, I need a lot of silence

I hope this holy water burn because I ain't worth this life
I ain't worth the light of day, but for some I light the way
Nude along the banister, kitchen smell of lavender
Swimming in my Wranglers, I am another caliber

I been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
And I ain't done (No, no)
Yeah (Tell something)
And I ain't done, you heard me?
I ain't done (Yeah, I'm screaming oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared)
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I put my life on standby
I can leave you alone


'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her ""Why this world love echoing hate?""
She said ""Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate""
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain

""They tried to take the bike. And they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. And then, um, then some  (Pressure) random stranger brought back his bike. We just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble (Pressure makes me—) because they found out like a day later.""
Do you want to start the game again?

Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that

I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head

Hi, my name is Merlyn, I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school,
 
hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase and a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke and whip an Audi coupe
Crazy, if I did that, wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pitfalls of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
'Til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion, just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves, well...

I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around

I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-milk-lyrics

Always planned to be a rapper when I failed at life
Luckily professor failed me at the proper time (yee! yee!)
Shh-shh, shh, I say ""please"" all the time, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, I like white collar crime, bitch
Shh-shh, shh, money digital broke and
Shh-shh, shh, Ghana prince in your messages

I know you hate me for leavin'
Then let's go crazy together
When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
Just so that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will

Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face (woo, woo, woo!)

What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, ""Gather 'round, place your bets!
This young man won't ever be shit!""
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall
When you were calling, they said I'll be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th—th—they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Piddling voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say! (Rrrah!)

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk (niggas talk too much!)
They forgot how to listen (listen!)
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix New Edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions, I don't ask permission
Ain't no politician, don't ask my opinion
You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searching the meaning
I think that’s why you won't believe and the future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming of making moves like the government

Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain

She hit me with the ""what-ifs?""
And the ""what-whens?"" and the ""what-thens?""
Wonder where my life went, living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent, are the bills paid?
Is it make or break? Will I find a way?
Have my feelings changed? Will I be okay? I don’t know
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet

I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away

The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in The Woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas, ""Come and find me""
Gotta say it in my eye view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running out of issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kinfolk

Taking a book out the page of the greats
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talking the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just 'cause I can't relate, I don't debate
I educate, illuminate
Or we can't duplicate, no more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated
Unappreciated, so I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you
Because it's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?

Disregarding the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playing games with you to play your part
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars

Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big-ass house and big-ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life ,highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut, really know the place
Projecting on me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite

Ego like celebrity but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails

From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good

In the city I'm a menace, I give CEO's the business
Marathons I gotta finish, foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately, I been feeling vicious, why y'all crying like some infants?
You don't wanna be a witness?
Then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim, we the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them
But they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I loved would make me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top
Just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus
Tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids
Give me love before you try to give me noise, I destroy

VICTOR ROBERTS,GINGER,2019.0,"My fuckin' Power Rangers couldn't protect me from that LAPD kick door
Motel, pig-pork
Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
""There that shit go""
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
""Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes""
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, ""Oh fuck""
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be

Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me

Thank God for me, thank God for me

We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct

Trade in that noose they put around us for a Cuban link
So my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
I remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
That pollution still ain't stunt my evolution
What you choosing?

No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea (Hoo!)

Reporting for the operation
I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my detail for decoration
So baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June

Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault

Make decisions I'll die by

ALASKA,SATURATION III,2017.0,"I used to work for people
I made a couple hundred dollars, wasn't worth it even
I'm worth a hundred thousand
Not dollars but diamonds, I am mud out the bayou
Rip a page out the Bible, come and crucify me
I'm a long way from home and this ain't Yellowstone
I trade a white bitch for catfish and yellow bones
This from the catacombs, this for the broken homes
From the south side of cities where my granny home
I moved to California, I bring a Grammy home
I call up bill collectors, ""leave my fucking family 'lone""
We left the corner store on the way to caviar
The coupe is mustard colored, what the fuck is Grey Poupon?

Young K.A., never quit your day job, uh
I bring the love to work, I need the day off, uh
I need the , this hard work should pay off, uh
The lights stay off until my mind is made up, uh

These niggas copy us, they really need to pay us, uh
I'm from the city where your neighbors fight back
You talking shit, we bring that work right to your lap

Tore down walls all my life, here's to the other side

Nowadays he's stumbling, they show such love to him
I shut it down to every show, we set the precedent
I'm just tryna show these niggas, life is on some other shit
Keep your head high, smile when the trouble rumblin'


I don't do what they say, it's unorthodox
Like bears sharing porridge inside with Goldilocks
Like Ozzy with no Sharon, he just called his parents
So fuck what I'm doing and fuck these damn critics
You should think for yourself, that shit is cancerous
Get my head rubbed by fingers of fuckin' hand models
Middle finger, fuck the hair up at all our concerts
Maybe if I cared less, I'd wear a hair net
But now my eyes, ten million by twenty five

STAINS,SATURATION III,2017.0,"I spent like a year and a half on the Greyhound bus
On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over

Y'all motherfuckers made three albums
Still talking about the same shit
The one gay, the one selling drugs
The one that's tryna act like Lil Wayne
What the fuck is this shit man?
Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip
When y'all enter my whip, y'all better not play this shit
'Cause this can go right the fuck off

Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like, ""Where y'all get it from?""
Rehab poppin' like when Amy had the single out
Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up
Talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'til the sun up, ay
Hopefully get our funds up, ay
And if I didn't know y'all
Maybe I would have a desk job
Ticking 'til I off myself...

Used to drive around for some hours (Oh-oh)
Used to get paid by the hour (Oh-oh)
Now I'm just pickin up my check (Oh-oh)

Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby

I spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I’ve been tryna avoid
From before I was born
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle I saw on the wharf
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself, goddamn

Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute (Ooh), I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby

Shit, high-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shawty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator,
 I ain't sayin', I'm hittin'
I was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you
I'm wonderin' if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through
With your fine disguise, yeah, yeah
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la

If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long

We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy? (that cray)
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DMs on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?

¿Cómo se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos
I want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
I'm one-handed like Odell, numb the pain like Orajel
Up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like ""Oh, well""
What that smell like, oh, Chanel? Way too deep like depths in hell
Need a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy
Talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh, don't forget me

Coming like—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Take it back—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' em—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

Radiation is present, got my reflection iridescent
Every little moment I step in, might shift the planets direction
Glitch in the system is present
You might wanna check the connection
I don't give a fuck about freshmans
I don't give a fuck about veterans
If your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension
Of my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
It's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
Paradiddles hidden in riddles; vapid and accessories
So please don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
Didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
Ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant
We claimed this spot from the basement, so tell me, who you again?
Oh you was this, you was that?
But now you washed and you hate it?
You taking shots with revolvers, I got two drones at the station
Hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
You paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with aging

We get money, get dough
Dame más mi princesa says so (Uh)
Even though my teeth not gold
Baby girl know our pockets drip folds

We get money, get dough

Do it my way, like everything I do
Take my breath away
Don't let me fade away
May die before I wake
Not the type to play
I take, and take, and take
Never want a change
Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed
Memories of the days
I was young at heart
Matters of the heart
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase

Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd
I'm weak and I'll say it proud
Built me up, pull me down, let's air it out
Patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better
Just patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better (Make me better)

I just had a dream that you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
I just hope your lil' bro grow to be great (Ayy)
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream where you took it all away (Ayy)
Blow smoke in the face
One in the clip, and one in the chamber (Yeah)
We was riding in the dark, you were putting your legs up (Legs up)

Did I ruin your life baby, even from day one? (Uh-uh)

I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y’all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see ’em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room
With no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it

I don't speak like I used to
I’m thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I’m true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you
It’s hard to feel what's real, some nights I'm scared that I'm delusional
I’m scared I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve

But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read

TAPE,iridescence,2018.0,"I can barely rap, I can barely dance
I can barely laugh, I can barely hang
I want a male stripper to do a belly dance
For me and my boyfriend, that's entertainment
And I'm drunk as fuck, my niggas tuxed up
I need a reason to get my bucks up
I need a reason to care about society
They need a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, you see my mom can't walk
And her lungs don't work like they used to
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit that's just fucking rude and untrue, and
But truthfully, the words had damage, and it's cruel to me
But even more cruel to be
Dissing you in front of niggas that pay to hear me

Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off it
I should probably spend my time
Writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace
They want my niggas to burn with us

Flicking on the face of my wrist watch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lyin', don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with
Tragedy after tragedy, God, send a message
Send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light

I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like, ""You lucky where you at""
""You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that""
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For my shell, fuck the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering ""who is me?"" now
Wondering ""where you been?"" now
Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14
I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account move like speeds now
Make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now

It's crazy how things feel the best
When reminiscing 'til we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left
Say they feeling left out when we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night
Until I'm forced to close my eyes

Why your teeth like that? (Or like a prairie dog)

I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like, a psys- fuck!
You mean psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to you
Yeah I am not Carrabba's, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the ""fuck you's""
'Cause they shit on your shit, stab you right in the back
'Til you're shittin' on the toilet with Grammys in your lap

Niggas talk a lot of shit, in a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard, they shootin' uppercase

Commander and the chief like, Barack Hussein

Flying out of Houston, lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety, seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations, guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious, all these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience, nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head

I feel the voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose, they just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume, I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon, I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall, I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream, I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth, y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture, they wanna dream in the trap

FIGHT,SATURATION II,2017.0,"My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up, I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say:
""Little Black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street""
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey; see, your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture’s dependent
On what you didn’t inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant

All my real niggas still fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been set up

I cannot explain it
Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying
Life put me here for a reason, I am not complaining
Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back

I been dripping candy paint, grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone, you see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
And shout out to my cousin Mo, he got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary, he ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either, so send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers, man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood, besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab, tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup, I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me, I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster, there's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga with the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus, and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry, why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million, and one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings

I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on

One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up

I got on TV, then I turned into an asshole
'Cause I ain't selling dope or running with them bad folk
I'm eating shrimp and lobster, sitting next to white folk
Now I'm in Trader Joes with Birkenstock and iPhone
My agent called said they want me in the movies now
They used to call me ugly, turned 'em into groupies now
Now I'm on Melrose, I'm ready for my closeup
They call me pretty, need to put me on the poster
I write my name, then I buy a Testarossa

Feel like a goldfish in the bowl with
Twenty other goldfish with the bowl switched
Bowl-cut or the mullet 'til I shaved it
Barely made it but I'm still here on my kickstand
Did the same shit that duffed Whitney Houston
They was boostin' while I'm slurping from my sippy cup (sippy cup)
Need blue jeans, pulling out the pocket fluff (the pocket fluff)
Talking to myself like I am my best friend (hello, hello, hello)
When I walk, see the arrogance flushing (hello, hello, hello)
Make the front page like Paris in the sex tape (oh)
Barely late to my first date with my therapist

Brrr! Call me, I'll be running in my, Asics
Gold plated belt buckle 'round my, sweat'ns
Tube socks, white tee, Polo underpants
I will never grow old, call me Peter Pan
Dial *67, when they need to listen
I move just like a phantom, I should have been a teacher
Handing out these lessons, my pupils ask no questions
They like to think they're special, I feed them graham crackers
Got my Timex in the mail, keep it in the case
They tapping lines every day, I cannot be traced
I don't believe in credit, my people call me different
I evade, then get paid, brr! Just a second

Trusty press, wear the colors of the ocean
Skeetin' sad in my Supreme clothing
Hit my line if you ever need an OZ
Don't hit my line if you think you know the old me
Have gassed-ass plans in the e-class
And I'm still getting head on public transit
And I'm still really sad about my last chick

""Ay, this is Matt and this is Things We Lost in the Fire Radio.""
""Hey, what's up, it's Shawn Mendes and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio.""

It's too damn easy, to hide away, or run away
For me they're both the same, I just need a reason
Before I choose to stay before I choose to say ""I love you""
These three simple words, have caused me so much hurt
Ooh, la, la, ooh, la, la
I feel it, I'm feeling, those feelings, I feel them
Ooh
Was told the beauty's in the details
But I'm not the type to say how I might feel
Started in high school, got my diploma
Then dropped out of college, always been a hard-head
Lacking in knowledge
But goddamn, man, when will this end?
I need new friends
And maybe it's okay to fall in love again

""If I dedicate myself to one thing, I need to focus on that
If I dedicate myself to something else, I need to focus on that
To try and do all these, and do the road, do stand up, and do a television show and then try to deal with our marriage and our home? Something's gonna give. Something's gonna give and I don't want to do that.""
""And what's the most precious to you beyond family?""
""My comedy.""
""Comedy. Not the sitcom, not the stand-up, just comedy?""
""My comedy.""
""Being able to create truth...""
""Right.""
""And enjoy, and entertain""

But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

Made in the projects, slave to my progress

You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts
She hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me
I'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab

Oh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week
It's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax

Find me in the ground, only time I regress
Six feet down, no I'm not there yet
Won't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck
So a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship
Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions, so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?

I don't know difference
Mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this

I be going ham on Ray Street eating tofu
Loiter at the Whole Foods, sipping kombucha
Yeah, I went green but the black'll still do ya

Tell me all the ideas, they would never believe
You see I remember my home
I remember those trees, I remember those pasts
I remember the breeze, I remember the reason why all of those people that passed
Remember you opened your heart for a second
Gave me your time for a minute
Remember the tone in your voice when I told you that I might be coming to visit
But maybe I’m tripping

Down this road again
But this time I ain't falling

Look at this world and I start withdrawing

READY FOR WAR,UnKnown,2018.0,"Baby child
Lift your head and free your mind
Open up your eyes, and you'll find you will fly
Just smile sometime
Welcome to the real world

Everybody pray for peace when they don't have the power
A disconnect of intellect
Know some people packing straps, you could call 'em cowards
The realest Gs I ever met
Not on the gangster shit, not on the paper shit
Just on that have to provide for my kids and shit
There's blood on the streets
And if I had a dream, I would do anything, I make mistakes
The shit that you hear about ain't just in movies
Dog, I've seen some shit
Bag 'em up in body bags, zip 'em up and send 'em
Away from the kids
I know good felons, good drug dealers, good people
Bad system, bad people
With power
If you gotta dream and you know what that means
You can do anything, just make a change

Sometimes I think back to the ninth-grade campus
When that white boy made fun of my lips
I should've thrown a tantrum
But I remained cool cause he was way too handsome
Now I'm out in Beverly Hills using a mansion as my canvas
I bought a helicopter, threw that bitch on stage
RCA gave us money, we ain't throw it away
We took that shit, we flipped that shit
We made this company pop
They like me, I want 'em to love me like them niggas love Pac
I'm De La Soul meets Tribe Called Quest
 
meets Oasis inside a G-Unit vest
I moved way out to the West side
But still got the South in my heart
They murdered Selena, now them niggas looking for God
Dressed like a soldier, told ya, they don't know who we are
My vest is on, let 'em know we ready for war
In the club with my boyfriend
We paranoid 'cause, we might get popped
'Cause a nigga on some bullshit
Why you wanna hate me now or ask the skies to lay me down?
I hear my brother praying now, I really need an angel now
Some type of holy savior
Ayo, Dad, do me a favor, could you pick me up later, later, later?

I've been exploring through the Joyful
The Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries
Historians romanticize notorious victories
The visions say the scorpion was born as a centipede
That partnered with the succulents to poison their enemies
I tap in time like telegrams with telepathy
To share the bare necessities of all my discrepancies
Can't save my Macbook pages spillin' onto the melody
'Cause the margins 'round the pen
Couldn't keep up with my head again, uh
I kept that devil in my sights to never fall behind
That's how we always stay ahead, the flaw of my design
The higher that you climb, the more destructive your decline
I’m well aware that all this didn’t have to quantify
So tell me if you really think it's unrealistic
Here at this point for me to not prepare and arm our district
They shouting, ""Hands up,"" while they deploying their ballistics
We shouting, ""Hands up,"" and kids who need it go ballistic
The difference in our League of Extraordinary Minorities
Against the identity, representing authority
Move between 'em accordingly, and clutch my rosaries
Before they try and send the lord for me, that's more for me
That's when the forerunners told me: ""This is not your speed!""
While they repeated their beliefs from the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found in life has never come from people
Still looking for an equal, nobody will believe you

God ain't give me a penny, I made a million dollars
I got a thug for a father so I took care of my mother
God threw me in fire, I walked out with my brothers
You know the Shadow of Death?
I was born in the valley, but now I live in The Valley
God gave me a house, God gave me depression
God gave us life, but we ain't know it was cursed
I was hurt as a child, you know I still deal with it
Now I'm a grown-ass man with immature-ass feelings
All I wanted was money, just to get it and spend it
On strippers and weed, I ain't skip on the liquor
I can't talk to my niggas 'cause if I say it, it's real
And I ain't ready to face it, I've been flirtin' with Satan
I've been flirtin' with women that like to dance when they naked
And I throw all of my dollars, I throw all of my problems
To the back of my throat with weed smoke and klonopin
I'm ashamed of myself
About three days ago, I planned on killing myself
But I'm still here breathin', you know I'm still here screamin'
Screamin', ""Fuck that shit"", we signed for fifteen million
And I almost missed it, I know that y'all niggas hear me

We found a light
Will you still carry me?
When I fall
Let the hope and the joy
Rain down on me

I just drink and drive
The freeway eases my mind and I can cry on my own

Drive to, um, wherever you'd like to

And nobody feels like you do
Plus, nobody understands the weight of the
Broken heart that you feel, so fuck it
You might as well just get real high and stupid
Rent a motel room and drink away your issues
It could be so simple, nobody wants to help you
They laugh and smile because you're different, you know
It's all your fault but you stay well-tempered
You've always had your wits about you
You hide away, so mental
And I'm glad you stay reclusive
You have a wound that's self-inflicted
And in times like this it's too late to fix it
The weight of the world couldn't change you
But if you died, no one would miss you

And all your demons, your deepest darkest secrets
The shit that keeps you from sleeping

But you don't have the power, 'cause I'm your master
Speed up and surrender, this time is different
So indecisive, no wonder why she left you

Put a bullet in your head or veer left off the highway
You're walking a tightrope at your lowest
Now you're hopeful, but that'll change when the night falls
You're a waste of a lifeform
You should do what you couldn't do this time last year
You can hope and pray all you want but nobody cares
Death waits for the time comes, and the time's come
Shut me up if you'd like to
But you're a coward and you know it's true
I'll be here if you need me, up to you

You blend in with the guys

PUPPY (Snippet 1),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ayy bruh, (You can turn it up a little bit)
Ayy bruh, calm your ass down boy (this that down South)
You know what I'm talkin' about?

This that down South nigga music
This that Whitney Houston, museum, movin' music
That them niggas ain't used to
I rock hard that I can't school 'em, I suppose that
I just look it ever since I heard you play in Coachella
I took a stack, made a rap and I ain't never look back
It made me sad when my parents wanna come to the shows
'Cause I diss 'em in my songs and they know every word
All my niggas get along but their egos' berserk
'Cause we finally getting money and the girls wanna twerk
And I love doin' Perc', I had to buy me a fur
I gotta pray for my nephew now his classmates scared
Oh, your uncle a rapper? Is he Lil Uzi Vert?
Nah, my uncle is gay and they think he a gimmick
How the fuck I'm a gimmick if I'm up at the clinic
Gettin' tested 'cause I take dick so motherfuckin' often
Bitches better calm me down before I motherfuckin' toss 'em
Ayy, nigga

Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself

Keep it upside down, keep you up, I come around
They stay right up on my tip, hopin' it's a fishscale
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC and see blood in my skin
They can see they move my feet like DDR
Hangin' out the car, dreamin' of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back
On the dollar  the way they really see me
Christina I move like genie
 feelings I steam it
Hop in the four and I’m speedin', bleedin'
She gaggin out the backseat, ayy, get it nasty
Killa motion bone deep, like C4, bitch I'm coastin'

Swimmin' in money, I know that they love me
They pay me in hundreds or pay me in gold (oh)
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I feel alone, I sold a piece of my soul (please)
I don't feel love anymore, where did it go?
I got a heart and then filled it with holes
Dipped it with glitter and gold
I wanna die, but it's some shit I should buy
Feelin' so empty inside (oh)
The more that I get, the less I can feel
The more that I smoke, the more I forget
I hit the road, my bitch in my whip, that's all

Somebody help me now, right now
Oh, somebody check it out, yellow
Please, somebody help me now, right now

Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist (oh)
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist (please)
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself

Alright, yeah, woo! Now nigga, what's the word?
I got a thousand dollar one-way train to Luxembourg
I'm drinkin' whiskey with no ice, I feel my stomach burn
I made a life I want, I know that make your stomach turn
Respect the story, toys I’m aiming, how are you submerged?
I'm drownin' daily in my sickness all my dreams absurd
I'm not an alcoholic homie  wanna know who concerned",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-puppy-snippet-1-lyrics
POISON,ALL-AMERICAN TRASH,2016.0,"You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control

You are my drugs, you are what I need
The love of my life, you kiss me, I bleed
At night when I fiend, I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak, if I could jump I could fly
It's so cold in the clouds, but I stay in the sky
And I see you on the ground, I guess it wasn't the same
You know I smoke and you drank, we ain't one in the same
I can't remember your name, but I remember your scent
And I remember your face, and I remember the…
And I remember the days, we wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change, I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom’s to blame

You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control

DON’T BE FAMOUS,Things We Lost in the Fire Radio,2018.0,"I sold that dope in the dormitory
I know my roommate informing on me
I told my momma she shouldn't worry
Start taking student loans from the country
I will pay that shit off 'til I'm forty ('til I'm forty!)
I don't want to have to make McFlurries
Sellin' students single sacks got boring
My college kids facing keys like both quarters
My thug life to every lad sandstormin'
Set up shop, exhibit product like it's a car show
The shit is pure man, while he sell the Sweet'n Low
Catchin' hell in my BM convertible
Deep Dallas in the winter, place so hard
Put that gold jump rope on the floor

You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

F—fuck with the cops, they beating the cases
I see the pistol 'round waist and they aiming
White doesn't fly with carnations, they pain me
Family need a little sleep and serenity
Popping cherry cola like her virginity
Confidence sink on the brink of a better me
I keep an eye up on your bitch in bed with me
Knowing that you will just bet on the death for me
I got the fragrance, throw me the cologne
Sipping so long, they love your cologne
Fuck the percentages, I want the leverage
I want the leverage
I be reserved, I do not blurt
Keep out my face with your petty little urge
Life like a blur, learn 'bout the curves
Skin and my body, I've been insecure

You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school

Yeah (yow, yow, yow, yow)

I am from another dimension
Better step to me with nine hitmen
Freeway Ricky I'm a line kingpin
This present moment's a divine vision
Saw my past and took a dive to dig in
Couldn't make myself a pot to piss in
Motivation lacking my decisions
This felt like a holy intervention
I put that pack in my undergarments
Them boys had locked the pharma department
Packing up pills at the base apartment
I didn't taste it, thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newport's rolled with marijuana
Someone broke and sold the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em
Boys woke him with the straps out
They ain't know about the stash house
Couple decades got evaded
'Cause he moved the last piece before he passed out

Self, hurtin', hurtin' my
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my, hurtin'
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself

I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing

I know it's awful for my health, I know it all becomes extreme
I can't redeem from this regime that's invaded all of my dreams
From the asphalt to the steam, we found a theme then made a scene
At the moment that the guillotine was the only vaccine don't intervene

Someone has to shine
The boys of the wild found each other during their time of need

Learn, learn, share, hope
Running away from home, facing the fears of the real world
Maintaining to hold on to the idea that connected them all to this is difficult

Why I be lookin' like the rich and in college?
Whatever you do, do not stop it
If you wanna salad all up in your pocket
I must be addicted to only the prices
Walk up, buy the diamond, the riches
Whenever they hear this, I wonder what this is
Stop in the field like the different to bridges
I feel like, let's say we run that shit back, and I better keep hittin'
One of them rings on the finger like Rodman and Jordan and Pippen
I had epiphany, I wanna three-peat
I split the wave and they glisten like 
Back of the truck with the stack like I'm Scooby-Doo
Waggin' that tail like I'm talkin' dog, who are you?
Bitch in the back and they starin' like, ""Who are you?""

Never let you go and we never coming down

To let 'em know I never let the pressure know me
You couldn't even hold a candle to the old me
So what I look like letting you try to control me
I'm on a mission to reclaim the times that broke me
The life I took is not the one that fuckin' chose me
And I ain't goin' back, I'm ridin' in the sunset
I'm pacin' between self-awareness and civil unrest
Oh, everything I sign with every label seems to suggest
My fate is pre-determined, I'm for certain that's my success

I got everything I want and I want somethin' else
I try to fill the void and pull the Bible off the shelf
Ashes on my sheets, I find it hard to sleep
I got little problems, I know y'all sick of hearin'
I think I'm missin' somethin' but I can't think of nothin'
(That's true)

Real life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life has been livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films

In the back, in the back
Make it to Jerusalem with my fam in the back
In the back, in the back
The haters still infragrant but that payback is exact
House packed to the max
Niggas in the kitchen, niggas in the back
Nothing in my fridge but my hunger is in that
Niggas havin' visions, layin' they own tracks
Shit been south central, niggas in the back
In the back
When I make it I'ma

I would do it in the dungeon, no barely function
I would do it in the dungeon, just barely function, picking sh-
I would do it from the dungeon, could barely function
Pickin' strawberry with my aunty, with the answers
With the long sleeves, upper ground pool in the backyard
With the bare pull, with the bad luck
Shouldn't wait on me, takes a while 'fore that bed, homie

I'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it

I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type
Why don't you take your mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
""Why you always rap about bein' gay?"" (Bitch)
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay (Bitch)
Where I come from, niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my hand off and, and my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
I got my hand on an ounce, so now I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
I took an eighth of them shrooms, now I've been hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them

I don't think the monsters ever left my bedroom
I been hiding in the closet, outta legroom
I don't know if that little somethin' ever helped you
All I know is I can't trust what's in my head too
I been running from the words I never said to ya
I been duckin' all the judgement, let me say it through ya
I was fighting till they said I can't defend you
All I know is I'm the one you should've stepped to
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin'
I'm on a mission
, every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'

My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk that want a ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like
And, yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say ""why not?""
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say ""fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy

Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercover

""What effect did the depression have on your marriage?""
""
Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new label, 'Diana's unstable and Diana's mentally imbalanced', and unfortunately, that seems to have stuck on over the years.

""Are you saying that label stuck within your marriage?""
""I think people used it. And it stuck.""
""According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time things became so difficult, that you actually tried to injure yourself. Is that true?""
""Mhm. When no one's listening to you, or you feel like no one's listening to you, all sorts of things start to happen . For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commas, but I was actually crying because I wanted to get better.""

And it's breakin' me slow, my Lord
Caught crying in the corner
But something's missing

Give me some free time. Feel like I'm stumbling again. Let me see some red lights . It's like I'm goin' ninety-five in a school zone. Too fucked up to realize I'm speeding, impacting lives, I jeopardize everybody I run into, what?  Got people crashing around me, gettin' lit up like a b-day candle. Remember when we were five and bein' lit was something that didn't involve no Grey goose handle? Life changes, man, not for the best. Nostalgia is innocent, something you could never repossess. I still start dancing in the rain. Other times I wish I was a teardrop, though. Maybe a raindrop ain't so bad falling from the sky. Sometimes I think about fallin' from the sky myself, and it's not in the right way. Nobody asked me to be this way, I'm just inside",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-technical-difficulties-lyrics

Waiting for the reception from the other side

Stole My Heart,TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES,2020,"Lyrics from Snippet

Take in stride, love and devotion
Don't confide, it's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide, it's gonna subside
She stole my

But if just she stole my heart

I thought I love the light, common day
I ain't going for the drama, kid
Niggas moving to the city, seek for attention
Everything we do, word, shit got me stressin
Stressed out, 
My boys smoke  no stress, just lifestyle choices
Everyday I wake up, I get dressed, for who? For what?
A city shut down, a ghost town
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
Lot, lot, and that's all I got

I got everything, the summer came
 better day
But I still have dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
She stole my heart, before I landed
Stole my heart, hope I understand it
Stole my heart, but I still got dreams of you
I got good dreams of you

Stole my heart
But if just she stole my heart",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-stole-my-heart-lyrics

I so surpassed all of them that I, that I, that it-it's, uh, it's not as meaningful to me anymore. I really love the work itself. I've examined myself on several occasions: Why am I really doing this? Am I doing this because I want to be famous? And I think there was an element of that when I started out; I wanted to be a rainmaker.""
""Well, we should talk about that one for a quick second. What does that mean?""
""It means, uh, I think I wasn't necessarily seeing as much or as, uh, apparently as I wanted to be when I was a kid. I had, I had a job, uh... at least in my own mind and that was to make my mother feel better. She was, uh, kind of, uh... very ill in many ways. And that, so it was to make her feel better. And I think ultimately I imitated my father. He was a very funny guy. But also, I felt some need—I, I don't if maybe they created it or I created it—but I had a need to make them feel like their life was worthwhile, that they did something special by the very fact that they bought me into the world. From a very young age, I wanted to convince them that I was a miracle... and then I wanted to convince the world that I was a miracle.""",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-jeff-goldblum-intro-annotated

I told the devil that I got him in my sights again

We just some carbon based life forms spitting hydrogen
Sometimes I wind up so the gears inside my mind will spin
Switching lanes, 110, I know they like to pretend
Don't try to sleep cause they might take your dreams and cash them in
Consume the pack and clap for all the ones surpassing trends
My bones are black, my blood is red, my brain a javelin
They play for paper, but I'm safer with my oxygen
Wave like tsunami, with this proxy, everybody wins
Pass on my posse till they start to photocopy them
Life after purpose had me in the game but out of it
So it's no time for folly gotta point out all the counterfeits
I'm counting on this gift to guide me to whatever's right within
I've been divisive, now I try to stay above the fence
Need all my soldiers till we over every wall and trench
You'll have to pardon us for contact marijuana stench
I thought to switch it up but then remembered that this flow is rich
With history. Your come up is a myth to me
My vision monolithic and my aura is a mystery
Step beside the critics with an effortless delivery
My presence is a symbol of my victories

Just make the motherfuckers feel it, 'cause it's hammer-sized

Move my niggas to Montana, only keep a landline
Holler if you feel me, this feel like the night that 'Pac died

And I fuck my thugs, that's love (Merlyn)

Burnin' big bushes but they never burn to ashes

Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis

Arriba y abajo como oso de Gopher, pásame como ""Oh, bueno""
¿A qué huele eso, Chanel? Demasiado profundo como las profundidades en el infierno
Necesito un trago humeante de whisky, abajo de esta perra como, oh, están molestos
Hablando, oh, no te pongas boquiabierto, te amo, oh, no me olvides

Viniendo como: ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Llévatelo, ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin 'em: ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

La radiación está presente, tengo mi reflejo iridiscente
Cada momento que entro, podría cambiar la dirección del planeta
Glitch en el sistema está presente
Es posible que desee verificar la conexión
No me importa una mierda los estudiantes de primer año
No me importan los veteranos
Si su percepción no es ascendente, no hay razón para la extensión
De mi energía, esta mierda solo sucede una vez en un siglo
Es elemental cuando todo lo que hablas es rudimentario
Paradiddles ocultos en acertijos insípidos y accesorios
Así que por favor no se equivoquen, se aprovechan las oportunidades
No queríamos ser pacientes, tuvimos que luchar por esto
No hay ninguna actuación complaciente, la falta de respeto ha sido demasiado descarada
Reclamamos este lugar desde el sótano, así que dime quién eres de nuevo
Oh eras esto, eras eso?
¿Pero ahora te lavaste y lo odias?
Estás tomando disparos con revólveres, tengo dos drones en la estación
Presiona el botón, podrían venir y dejar tu legado vacante
Allanaste un camino que no queríamos demoler con el envejecimiento

Conseguimos dinero, obtenemos masa
Dame más mi princesa lo dice (Uh)
Aunque mis dientes no sean dorados
Bebé, conoce nuestros bolsillos pliegues por goteo
(¡Woo! ¡Woo! ¡Woo! ¡Woo!)
Conseguimos dinero, obtenemos masa
Dame más mi princesa lo dice (Uh)
Aunque mis dientes no sean dorados
Bebé, conoce nuestros bolsillos pliegues por goteo

Dinero en mi ..., dinero en mi ...
Niggas que yo, niggas que yo
Dijimos qué pasa, dijimos qué pasa
Mensaje que yo—, mensaje que yo—
Llama a su hermano, llama a su hermano
Niggas mirando, niggas mirando
Deja que mis niggas, deja que mis niggas
Niggas con eso, niggas con eso

Ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Hablando sobre: ​​ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin 'em: ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

NEW ORLEANS (español),BROCKHAMPTON - iridescence (Tradução),2018.0,"""—Perfectamente bien, ¡está bien!""

Dijo hermano negro, hermano negro, ¿para qué vives?
¿Vas a terminar lo que empezaste? ¿Por qué renuncias?
Me dijeron que Dios me dio una misión
Pero me faltan los suministros para completarlo
No soy el que deberías leer, estoy acostumbrado a ser derrotado
Entonces nigga, hermano, ¿con quién estás parado?
Soy independiente porque estas fiestas nunca planearon esto
Hermano nigga con cerebro, desviándose involuntariamente en cada carril
El sentimiento nunca es el mismo, persigues lo que no puedes ganar
Estoy tan acostumbrado a las llamas que no podría decirte qué es el fuego
La situación es grave, escuche las llamadas del coro
La disposición adquirida desde mi posición en la Tierra
Me dice ""¡Decapita todo por lo que vale!""
Cuando muera, estas palabras van a necesitar ataúdes separados y un coche fúnebre
No rimo, congelo el tiempo y dejo que estas manos solo hagan el trabajo
Estoy en tándem con mi maldición, volviéndome loco desde mi nacimiento
Mira el lienzo como un planeta al que mando con mis nervios, ah

Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano
Dile al mundo, no tengo miedo de nada
Dile al mundo que no tengo miedo de saltar
Dile a mi chico que quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferente con algunas funciones diferentes
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano
Dile al mundo, no tengo miedo de nada
Dile al mundo que no tengo miedo de saltar
Dile a mi chico que quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferente con algunas funciones diferentes

Intenta tratar al hombre como a un bebé
Siente los dientes hundirse como la rabia
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Chico, sabes que no pareces volar
Las cadenas de oro te ponen verde el cuello, adiós
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah

Nada diferente ahora (¡woo!) Por todos lados ahora (woo!)
¿Con quién te quedas ahora? Eso es un gran reflejo
No me gusta cómo me hablan, ¿por qué caminan hacia mí?
Usa tu mierda en tu manga, deja de proyectarme
El sentido es tu sonido envolvente, ¿cuál es tu opinión sobre mí?
Mata el ego ahora, ¿qué significa eso de mí?
Ángulo de pantalla panorámica, un par de sorbos de Tanqueray
Voy a lanzar un par de golpes, lo haré de todos modos
Anímate pequeño hijo, me deslizo como la macarena
Perder tiempo, escribirlo, estilo condimentado, jalapeño
Supersónico, moverse a través del túnel, ciclo de dos ruedas, ligeramente
Silencio multitud mejor que 9 milímetros con supresor extendido
Bustin 'fuera de la función, muy cómodo
Tengo a Martine en mi cuerpo, hombre, mi sudor letal
Dulces besos como los dulces del carnaval
Voy a llamar mis propios disparos, golpear el audible

La muerte inminente es el único signo de vida
Estoy lanzando Ave Marías hasta que muera
Tíralo, todo lo que tengo es tranquilidad, vomitando
Tengo mis alas cortadas, no las necesito mierda
Aprende a volar de nuevo
Vía rápida al último lugar, lo juro
Nunca he estado arriba pero estoy aquí en algún lado
Aquí afuera, nadie puede decirme mierda
Mierda, no importa lo que hice en ese entonces
Deberías mirarte a ti mismo
Tal vez puedas encontrarte, amarte a ti mismo
Aquí está la salud y la riqueza, todos juntos ahora

Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano
Dile al mundo, no tengo miedo de nada
Dile al mundo que no tengo miedo de saltar
Dile a mi chico que quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferente con algunas funciones diferentes
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano
Dile al mundo, no tengo miedo de nada
Dile al mundo que no tengo miedo de saltar
Dile a mi chico que quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferente con algunas funciones diferentes

Hoo! Hombre vudú
Mamá me llevó a la iglesia y canté un himno
Co-colonizado Chris-ti-an
Ahora estoy perdiendo mi reli-gi-on
Maldita sea, tan narcisista este milenio
Jódete a ti y a la burbuja en la que vives
No voy a la iglesia, pero soy muy espiritual
Saqué mi vida de la tierra, eso es un milagro
Si Jesús fuera una estrella del pop, ¿rompería el banco?
Todos estos diamantes en mi cara, estoy brillando como el día
Estoy viviendo en mi mejor momento, hombre, ¿qué puedo decir?
Si el servicio es una hora, llego una hora tarde",https://genius.com/Brockhampton-new-orleans-espanol-lyrics

Es diferente reconciliarse con esqueletos que no sé que poseía
Busqué la perfección en formas que ya no acepto
Entiendo lo que descuido en momentos en que me obsesiono
Estoy aprendiendo a confesar, este destino es más difícil de digerir
La mayor amenaza a la que me enfrento es a quién enfrento en mi reflejo
La depresión sigue siendo un invitado no invitado Siempre estoy aceptando
No puedo evitar encontrar el sentimiento con un abrazo familiar
Cuando sé que me matará si cedo en mi cerebro
Veo las sombras adentro, miden tres metros de altura sin ojos
Me pusieron la cabeza en el agua y es tan hermoso debajo
El sol se refleja en los corales, colores que no puedo describir
Para hacer divina la oscuridad
