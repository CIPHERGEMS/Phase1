This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'll run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

Nigga I'm tired of this niggas barkin' that shit, talkin' that shit
From the concrete when they chalkin' that shit
And then he goes in a bitch pose and a throw back
Holdin' a gat, ain't gonna bust and know that
It's a 
Dub-S-C
 thang W.C. brain
And we don't fuck with niggas in khaki g-strings
Fuck movin', I'm clearin the crowd
It's the who bangin' ban-dana cri-mi-ni-mi-nal, the ori-gi-nal

Evacuate the building bitch here come a plane
No, it's the mad ass Westside Connect Gang
And fuck what you playin' nigga, this who bang
With enough game to drive a swear bitch insane
And we number one gunners, no, we ain't stunners
It's real with us homey, killers and drug runners
And Mack need a D-bo in a H2 Hummer
Lookin' hotter than a 
South Central L.A.
 summer, let's go

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

What the fuck is Ice Cube talkin' about?
That's how you get these nuts parked in you mouth
Westside ride bitch, the same old shit
I don't conversate with pussy, I ain't gon git
I don't holla at these hoes that sing like Ashante
Body like Beyonce, face like Andre
 (Uhh)
Bitch you kinda strangé
But I'm rich so my entré
Got to be bombay

Have you seen us? Nah
Haters can't see us
Connect Gang we the G'est, nigga
Countless calls and countless charges
Street niggas makin' blunts out of Cuban cigars
Big by the linnas hyp-notic by the liters
With a flank of hoes on us cause the chronic is the greenest
And to my niggas incarcerated and on probation
I'mma stay bangin' for the whole G Nation, nigga

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

It's a Gangsta Nation if you in you a G
And the whole world influence by the B and the C
Now tell the truth rappers, you don't ball like me
Cause I'm really from the gang, ya'll is industry
And while I'm servin' up and comin' young hustlas and cluckas
Bangin' for the hood, causin' havoc and ruckus
You niggas at the label, kissin' ass like suckas
And you're bitches so sit down when you piss, mutherfuckas

One thing I do know, I ain't the uno
Big puno, rap sumo, on pruno (You know)
I'd like to thank the congregation
And my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah, I'm ruthless
You like a stick pussy, nigga, you're useless
You know the side bitch, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin' on it

Look here man
Check this shit out man look
Ya'll might as well say: ""Fuck it and join this Westside thing, man""
Cause we got a muthafucking Gangsta Nation goin' over here
And once you join this shit you as G as can motherfucking be!
Believe that, homie
Look, it ain't a hit til Nate Dogg spit

This game right here is rough as fuck
These hoes out here about the bucks
These fools out here afraid to bust
I have no fear, afraid of what
And with my peers, I'm comin' up
Fools talk real loud but don't run up
When we come through, they'd run'n'duck
We still right here so what the fuck?

Bow Down,Bow Down,1996.0,"The world is mine, nigga, get back
Don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga! Rewind my part fool and....(Bow Down)

(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you (Ooh!)

I take ten steps and I draw (Blaow!)
Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is elemental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag can't fuck with the Phillys
Holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola (Brr!)
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen, I chased the green, the crack-scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces (Ugh)
So recognize these real Gs, chase the cheese
The Westside Connec' keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing, it's like the California style
But in the meanwhile, in my town, you got to bow

(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

Well it's that, Chuck-wearing, still sporting the beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me?
As I slide my Locs on, let my khakis hang
Westside Connec' gang, Connec' gang, bing-bing bang (Westside!)
Run away, run away, or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S.T.A. (Ahh!)
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang-related, simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck
About you niggas in this rap game (Ugh!)
Flashy niggas get stuck up (Ugh!), beat the fuck up (Ugh!)
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this...
Zero-zero-apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist, I'm real with this (Yes!)
Talk the tal,k walk the walk
Diss me on wax?
I'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound, so bitch, shut up
And nigga, all y'all could kiss my Converse like Sho Nuff

(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you

Yeah
Ha
Let me tell you something
Gangsta's make the world go round
So you ain't got to clown
But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down
Westside Connection
The world belongs to us

Bow down
Bow down
Bow down

(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you (Fool)",https://genius.com/Westside-connection-bow-down-lyrics
"The Gangsta, the Killa and the Dope Dealer",Bow Down,1996.0,"Hey, living in a California cage
Y'all trying to study me?
Gangbangin'll never die, it's too much love
You always gonna get niggas like us, you know what I mean
God damn
How many more motherfuckin' penitentiaries y'all gon' build?
How many jars you gonna try to put us in?
You know what I'm sayin'?

Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda
Killa Cali is the state, murda

Can't none of y'all niggas fuck with none of these niggas
These triggers, we's killers (Hahaha)
Sittin' on the porch in between legs
With a bitch French-braiding my hair, nahhh!
Leave 'em til they matted forearm tatted
What's the Connection? Bitch, you looking at it
It don't stop, I hit mo' licks than it takes
To get to the center of a Blow pop (One, two, three)
And it's gonna take a miracle
To drive a car this color down Imperial
Yeah, I got heart
But ain't trying to see Marcia Clark
 (Punk ass nigga!)
So let's wait 'til it get dark
So many cars parked in my gate (*Beep-beep!*)
It's like the international, house of pancakes (Ugh!)
All on the grass (Ugh!), every bitch passed (Ugh!)
I'm first, not last, when we all hit the ass (Ahh)
Doin' tricks jacked up like a six (What!)
One pussy, and thirteen dicks
Gangstas don't dance, we boogie

Who's that dumpin' out that window, hoo-riding?
(West-Side!) Nobody survives when...
I got my steel up, throwing my shit up, pulling the trigger
 (Ugh)
What the fuck you lookin' at, nigga? (Punk!)
(*Whistles*) True blue when I bust
Leavin' bodies hangin' like the tongue of my Chucks
Chalk another one, homicidal in the G-ride
I swear I'm killing every nigga standing outside
Letting 'em have it, with my double barrel sawed off (Ugh!)
I'm smoking on everybody, niggas, bitches, and all
Stretch 'em out in broad daylight, motherfuck the witnesses
Eyes big as golf balls from the funny cigarette
 (Haha, yeah)
As the sun frowns on my foreheadt, I sweat murder (Murder!)
Which makes me the walking dead man
Bringing more bad news than Schleprock
When I bust shots (Ugh!), Dub-C keep the hammer cocked

Well, it's the nigga that's housin' the scene
I got pounds of green and birds
Sittin' on the triple beams (Yes!)
I put it down on and off the record my flats a
Double decker, marble floors all checkered
Now what can I say every bitch I lay be pure and
Bombay like Peruvian ye
So I brag and I boast man I got the most, man (Whoa-whoa!)
I make more deliveries than the postman (B-I-ITCH!)
My homie Carlito plug me with the amigos
So, now, it's kilos, five and six double zeros
Now, what's next? I'm stuffed like Kotex
Blindin' niggas with the boogers in my Rolex
With my aces OT on a regular basis
We got 
pavé'd faces
 fightin' federal cases (Ha!)
Cause ain't nothin' reala' than niggas gettin' they scrilla
Like a gangsta, a killa, and Mack I'll be the dope dealer

King of the Hill,Bow Down,1996.0,"Oh yeah it ain't over motherfuckers
These niggas don't understand
Every few years niggas got to get their motherfuckin' caps peeled back
Nigga this is Westside nigga, don't think, nigga don't think
Now, next motherfuckers go by the name of Cypress Hill
K all motherfuckin' day

Every few years niggas think they can deal with the real
Now I gots to fuck Cypress Hill
I got a voice you should fear
I drink a beer bust a rap and end your fuckin' career
You fuckin' cowards, never seen a hood high powered
Like the Westside Connect
Slide me my tech
I got 'em, soon as I spot 'em, I'm dumpin'
Gotta treat these bitch ass niggas like they stole somethin'
I see a joint in your clutch
You're smokin' that shit too much, got your bitch ass touched
Sen Dog you can't rap from the guts
And B-Real soundin' like he got baby nuts
I don't know why y'all think y'all slick
I don't know one rapper down wit' your click
I don't know one bitch on your dick
And I don't know one nigga bumpin' your shit
I hear you claimin' South Central wait
You ain't from my hood, y'all hoes from South Gate
Comin' with a voice high pitched
The ""B"" in B-Real must stand for bitch

We'll it's the hip-hop junkie startin' static
Now I'm rollin' up Cypress Hill lettin' niggas have it
Got these wannabe thugs up, load my slugs up
Hey yo back up Cube Dogg, we passed that bitch Muggs up
Pull over and let me out, it's on on sight
Now let me show this white boy what that Westside Connect like
Booya booya from the gauge as I spit them
The buck shots spray and made them lay as I hit 'em, uh
Ain't got to sweat his punk ass no mo'
1 down and 2 to go, hand me a fo' fo'
Let me get my ride on, get my homicide on
B-Real wish he could be me cause he know he can't see me bitch
You should have known you can't fade a real hog
Breathin' Inglewood smog, 'cause I'm a real dog
You bustas wanna see me but you can't come close
Because I'm Ace homies with Amerikkka's Most
Nigga miss me, I'm used to a ho tryin' to kiss me
Now what gave your bitch ass enough heart to diss me
You'll come up missin' and Sen Dog is so wack he ain't worth dissin'
You niggas need to listen
On everything I love my heat can't release a dub
Fuck rappin' fuck strappin', I created another bloody glove
It's 1 - 0 and for sho' I'll kill
You pussies can't match my skill 'cause I'm the King Of The Hill
[Verse 3: Ice Cube, 
Mack 10
]
Everybody in the ghetto, know what you're doin'
One white boy and two fuckin' Cubans
Claimin' that you're loco, but you ain't Mexican
Listen to ""No Vaseline"" before you flex again
Fuckin' with the hogs
You say you Bloods but you ain't liked by the dogs fool
On tour only rappin' to the yuppies
We the big fish I'll make a dish out you fuckin' guppies
So who are y'all with?
Niggas down with Cypress can wipe this shit off my dick
As I stick it like King Kong and play Ping Pong
With this fake ass Cheech and Chong
Did you tell ya momma that I had to help ya
When Sen Dog left your bitch ass in Australia
You say that I took your hook?
It must be the white boy thinkin' all niggas crooks
Now what, you hip-hop hippies?
How you fuckin' junkies
Think you gonna punk me and chill
And deal with the fact that you ain't got enough skill
To kill the King Of The Hill?
Ice Cube could you pass me my steel?
For real, 
I'm the king of the Hill
Mack10 could you pass me my steel?
For real,
 I'm the King of the Hill!
Ice Cube could you pass me my steel?
For real, 
I'm the king of the Hill
Westside could you pass me my steel?
For real,
 I'm the King of the Hill!

Westside Slaughterhouse,The Best of Westside Connection,1995.0,"Westside!

Microphone check 1-0 from the West Coast bailer and teller
I cuss like a sailor
When you see her she’s a goner, moved to California
Blew the bitch up and put the gangsta twist on her
Sunny Southern Cal, it never snows
Niggas yellin' ‘hey’s and ‘ho's
We jumpin’ outta 6-4's
When it comes to the gun play, we vets
It's West Coast for life, no crews, only sets

Well, it's the dog, breathin' out the smog
I'm a hog of this gangsta shit, Don of the clique
All you suckas wanna diss the Pacific
But you buster niggas never get specific
Used to love her, mad ‘cause we fucked her
Pussy-whipped bitch with no Common Sense
Hip-hop started in the West
Ice Cube bellin' through the East without a vest

Now as I look to my riz-zight and to my left
I see motherfuckers staring like they wanna step
So I'm grabbin' my rusty screwdriver
In case I got to cut ya deeper than Vanessa Del Rio's vagina
Find a-notha crew of niggas that can fuck with this
Lyrical bully, given verbal bruises to crews, fool
You must be on dick, dope and dynamite. How you figure?
Speed on before you get peed on, nigga

Fool, what side is you, red or the blue?
Wild as the L.A. Zoo, it's round two
I ignite, grab the mic tight, strike like a rattle
Bring your rhymes and nines to the muthafuckin' battle
So sun down to sun up, run up with my gun up
All brakes get to pumpin', you know a nigga dumpin'
You dread like a Rasta when I lock like a terrier
Mack 10, that nigga with the heat that'll bury ya

Oh ah, oh ah, do a walk by, and watch everybody die
Niggas into gangs, thangs and narcotic
Freak bitches, riches, and hydraulics
Pull heat, knock you off your feet
Clear the whole block, both sides of the street
Even Crips and Bloods hear my thuds
Fee fie foe fum—ay nigga, where you from? (Westside!)

Fuck all you niggas, I'm yellin'
This is M.A.A.D. Circle to the fullest everybody 187
Toones play the piano, fuck a battle
I'm socking rappers like mad man Santiago
‘Cause you niggas ain't impressin' me
Plus you signed to Big Red Records, so nigga, fuck what you tellin' me
Sit down junior, you couldn't see me if you wanted to
Look ya'll, it's Mack 10, Cube and the ""W""

Ice Cube: Westside’s on the map!
Mack 10: Niggas rappin’ since the ‘70s and still never went gold!

I just had a scrap for the neighborhood
Inglewood stereotype, gotta deal with the hype
Known to kick back with the fat sack, fuck that
Where my gat at? These niggas trippin’ off my Bulls hat
About to let loose with the chrome trey-deuce
Five shot, and I, put holes in your bandana
I push a Benz, you still rollin' G's
So nigga miss me with that set trippin’, start slangin' keys

When I say gitchy-gitchy, niggas get bitchy-bitchy
‘Cause they heard of the natural born murderer
I'm like Frankenstein, it's spankin' time
Layin' in the sunshine with only one nine
So who wants to bust with the never-rust?
Goin' platinum plus, every time I cuss
So fuck the whole world, black (Fuck ‘em!)
Niggas better hope I don't grow my jheri-curl back

Step up, murderer, steppin' out a Chevrolet
Sportin' a beanie like Marvin Gaye
Stalkin', walkin' in my big black Chucks
Standin' tall in your freestyle session holdin' my balls
I'm peepin' game like a ref in '95
‘Cause niggas be foul and bitin' other niggas' styles
But if you're bitin' this, you better bring a dentist
‘Cause sucking these balls'll give your ass lockjaw, fool

Which way shall I go? Nigga, what should I do?
Should I bang with the red or should I truce with the blue?
Should I rock dope beats, and grab the mic and stay down?
Or should I shoot out of town and flip this pound? Shit
I never thought that my nuts'a get bigger
Checkin' major figures, I'm hangin’ with platinum niggas
It's Mack 10 and I'm Inglewood swingin'
No time for bangin', but still got my khakis hangin'

Fuck one love, it's the bloody glove, killin' honkey hoes
Leaving blood stains on Broncos
In a Hertz rental, I drive on the 405
Is he dead or alive?
Mother-fuck court, took another snort
Jumpin' over chairs as I run through the airport
So I can catch a flight away from the drama
Number 32 chillin' in the Bahamas

Ah, Shucky Ducky, quack quack
Niggas ain't knowin' how to act
Sucka ducks play the back
Niggas used to diss but now it's turning around
And like Brandy, motherfuckers wanna be down with this
West Coast rap game, I can give a fuck
If you wasn't down at first, you can buck these nuts

And my hood ain't never dodging bullets
It's all about the Bloods and Crips, dogs and rips
Corners and dips, bitches and chips, nigga!

Woo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
What's this my frickeler radar system
Detects busta B-I-itches on the premises
Niggas be dissin on a down low
So now my motto is ""Fuck every rapper from the East and the West Coast""
New School, Old School, I hate you motherfuckers
I'm steady plottin wipin my ass with your album covers
Cross em out and put a'K
Even on Sundays nigga, to motha fucking holidays

'Ey! I Cross 'Em Out and Put a 'K!
Inglewoooood!
Nigga! To South Central L.A.!

Goddamn nigga! This shit make me sick
All these West Coast cowards ridin New York dick(Brrgh!)
Bustas get sprayed wearin high-top fades
And Kangols backwards with dark-ass shades
No switchblades, nigga, we shoot
That's how it is on the West when you're true to your roots
So kill the action, punk, hoochie bitches clown
Nigga get your sag on and keep your pants legs down

Check it! Ho shut your mouth and get naked!
I'm Connected and ain't no bitches singin on this record
No R&B tracks, just niggas on wax
Kickin facts with these gang-bang raps
Every nigga in the industry wanna rap with me
Like it's all good, you ain't from my hood
Nigga, I don't even like your shit, I don't like your crew
I'm true, you're through, nigga fuck you!

Nigga get off, this shit is wack
Fuck that, I bust you in the can with a motherfuckin bumper jack
Spit on ya, shit on ya, when I get on ya, piss on ya
Going up in ya, fucking ya, cause I ain't lovin none of ya
And even female rappers are getting smacked
Stabbed in the titties and kicked in the back
Cos I'm a westside Connection hoodsta
Far from a lover dishing nothing but bullets and dirty rubbers

Brrrgh!
In about four seconds, a killa will begin to speak

Now you can cross out the busters and snitches
B-Real and Ms. Muggs is like Hollywood bitches
From the niggas I know in the streets I run through
Swear to god bitch real it ain't one dog that know you (not one)
So watch what you say, who ya talk about, you tweekin
And keep hogs out'cha mouth when ya bitch ass is speakin
I'm sick wit it, cap at your dome till I hit it
This Westside Connection, Cypress know they can't fuck with it

Use to get kisses and hugs, now I'm servin ya slugs
Fuck B-Real and Muggs, y'all niggas ain't no fuckin thugs
T your surprise, everybody dies
From Columbian neck ties covered with flies
Ya fuckin maggots, ya fuckin faggots
I should alert you, every motherfucker that I know wanna hurt you
So when I pull my spray can to spray
I'm sprayin C-H-K all motherfuckin day

I once knew this bitch by the name of Q-Tip
Who claim he had a problem with this gangsta shit
Behind closed doors, runnin his mouth like a trick and
Til this nigga bout the name of Dub caught him slippin
Tied his ass up and threw him in the truck
Put an apple in his mouth then dug his ass out
About a month later they found his body stashed
In a trash bag with a cucumber in his ass


Don't go chasin waterfalls
Stick to them dicks and balls you're used to
Punk ass motherfuckers!
Brrrrgh!",https://genius.com/Westside-connection-cross-em-out-and-put-a-k-lyrics
Do You Like Criminals?,Bow Down,1996.0,"(WC)
Say ho I got way more dick than them niggas rolling you in lexos
No punk ass Versace gear just the nigga with the triple 1 braids in his beard
Quick to get the pussy dripping so quit trippin

Donnie Simpson

Or a bitch-made nigga cute as 
El Debarge

Him and those?
Individuals called criminals?
How'd you figure a West Coast nigga
Drinking liquor gots to know how to dig you

Never met a nigga quite as fly as me
All bottled up in your high society

Spice in ya life is what you need

On switches and I'm workin jerkin got ya nigga smirkin
Jack the ass up and down til my back wheels is chirpin

To be on the Shaw with a nigga with a Hyundai
I take you through my neighborhood raise where crime pays
No girbauds no fades just khakis and French braids
And my friends is niggas that know what ends is
In high-top Chucks pushin V-12 Benzes
With hoochy hoes groupie hoes
You know those with a gang of money lolos and penitentiary photos
So shake him now no need of waitin of debatin
Slam the door on them five stars and hop on these Daytons

But can you have you have dick up in them guts all the way to
These nuts
You're a rich girl far from skeezer
I'm playing broke at the mall with your Visa
You wanna swang with K-Swinger
(
When the West is in the house, oh my God! danger)
But take a hit you'll live
But when you hit it ho you got to puff, puff give
Now I hear you giggling
But all I wanna see is asses wiggling and titties jiggling
So what you wanna do?
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Stick to them dicks and balls you're used to
Go ahead and take a big lick
Cause girls look so good on the end of
My dick

Gangstas Make the World Go Round,Bow Down,1996.0,"I'm gettin' dizzy as the world keeps spinnin' like a Frisbee
Gangstas and girls make the world twirl
No hesitation I can run a nation from incarceration
30 years is what I'm facin'
But give me 7 seas and 11 G's
I make enough cheese to bring Wall Street to its knees
Nigga please I got enough guns
To fill the Empire State Building full of 1's
Go to school is what you tell us
But niggas in school is scared of the Goodfellas
We got the Yayo you can just say no
But nobody makes a fuckin' move until I say so
That's how it is and that's how it's gonna be
Kids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?
Like me ya black superhero
Got enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro
Ya Honor I'mma have to get rid of ya
Because it ain't no trivia about my flat in west Bolivia!
I blew the jury a kiss they rather dismiss
Than swim with the big fish
YOU fuckin' guppies!!!!!!!!

Gangsta's make the world go round

Nine just saggin', wavin' my flag and
Never will I ease up nigga, so stop askin'
See I was taught as a tiny locin' on the set
It's all about the pussy and money fuck the rest
Nigga what tech is quicker to collect when I'm seekin'
All the jewelry and the money, so miss me with that preachin' teachin'
Fuck all that bullshit I want to slang yay like Noriega
Sit back watch my paper
Collect like the I.R.S
As I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick just like the President
And like the police I want a gang of killers all on my Side
That's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride
On my behalf as I call shots, as if I was Saddam Hussein
Jackin' motherfuckers for Dana Danes
Hated by many but I don't care because I rather be feared than loved
With a pocket full of dubs
'Cause gangsta gangsta's, make the world go round
And if you want a piece then you best to be down
So quit, chastisin' me, analyzin' me
And like the escorts look over your shoulder nigga what's plain to see
Crooked ass cowards

Gangstas make the world go round

360 degrees like my D's the world be spinnin'
Nigga's been sinnin' since the beginnin'
History's a trip so I peep when I am readin'
Nigga's probably grew weed in the garden of Eden
Before big ballin' six cars and loot
Its like bitches been scandalous bitin' forbidden fruit
But gangsta's don't deal with that shit, on the Westside
And since they regulatin' hoes I rolls with the best side
So check it as my lifetime is tickin'
Comin' up strong lickin' and flippin' chickens
Need cheese in amounts of G's
I gave up sports to slang Key's
But blamed it on my Knees
Make sure I got what I need to make up your order
Everything from baggies, triple beams, to jugs for my water
Like a snitch life's a bitch, a world full of drama
Drug paraphernalia being found by my momma
Trauma brings the sad song yo momma sings, just served your ass You on your way to killa king nigga
So now I stand, with heat in hand
For my whole life span, 'cause evil lurks the land
Plus I got a packet with this gang-bang jacket
Gotta hold it, keep it loaded devoted, since quoted
Fo sho One-0 got the ups on these prankstas
While my world keep twistin' as a Westside, gangsta

Delivered with anger, your life is in danger
Beware of them strangers, holdin' them flamers
Them naggers were swagger, 'cause they keep it gangsta

Just face it, I blaze shit, yo' shit is basic
My shit is Matrix, make you erase shit
Niggas won't say shit, but DJs you ain't shit
'Cause you don't play shit, unless it's that gay shit
I'm straight off the slave ship, my style is ancient
I'm rich and I'm famous, I'm armed, I'm dangerous
I came wit' that language, it's mad, it's brainless
You studied at Cambridge, I'm fuckin' yo' main bitch
Plus my Ebonics is full, of gin and tonic, erotic
Yeah you got it, Hpnotiq, plus psychotic, brrr
After 9-11 niggas got patriotic
On nine twelve I'm like fuck it nigga blaze the chronic

Call nine eleven, then call your reverand
Then call heaven, here I come Lord
Live by the gun, die by the gun
A eye for an eye when you live and die by this war

This right here is considered a banger
Delivered with anger, your life is in danger
Beware of them strangers, holdin' them flamers
Them naggers were swagger, 'cause they keep it gangsta

Yeah, now it's the mornin' after the night I just rolled
9-1-1 ain't a area code it's a gangsta mode
And I'm still in amazement on how I put it down
Emptied round after round rat-tat-tat was the sound
Now understand the situation, it was urgent
We—handled this emergency urgently
I can't just have no nigga out there just workin' me, jerkin' me
Talkin' all kind of shit, dishing dirt on me, shit
He was a local nigga sheisty and didn't wanna pay up
So I got dressed in all black and loaded the K up
And all I could think about is revenge as I lit the J up
And even though it was late night, I still fucked his whole day up
It was child's play, the youngster took me for a joke
Not knowin' Mack a maniac and I love the gun smoke
Make sparks in my barrel, shit flew through his apparel
Stupid motherfucker lost his life over dinero

Call nine eleven, then call your reverand
Then call heaven, here I come Lord
Live by the gun, die by the gun
A eye for an eye when you live and die by this war

This right here is considered a banger
Delivered with anger, your life is in danger
Beware of them strangers, holdin' them flamers
Them naggers were swagger, 'cause they keep it gangsta

It ain't safe no fuckin' mo'
I swear on everything I love, my hood, my momma, my soul
This motherfuckin' Dub, is hall of bang nigga, I claim nigga
Like PCP to the brain, it's like heroin in my veins nigga
White lightnin' I'm sippin', snickerin', slippin' the crip
And like a fiend, I tremble, shiver and then blow your dome to smitherens
Act up, no actor, starch crease swagger
Dick harder than Viagra, Dub push your wig backwards
Connect alumni, but the gun high
Bloods and Crips and when we touch down we turn niggas' hoods into the Gaza Strip
Squeeze lead, to the y'all dead, 'cause I'm fucked up in the can and I
Fuck a bitch over whether she in blue or all red
The industry most hated, nigga get at us, we ready, Dub, Mack and Cube
Like Saddam, Bin Laden and O.J. in the Chevy
Back again, momma there go that man again
Grab the gun, them niggas on one

All the Critics in New York,Bow Down,1996.0,"Goddamn! New York City!
Skyscrapers and everything!

Back in the day, we used to respect y'all niggas
We used to be down with y'all niggas
All you have for the West Coast, is criticism and disrespect
So I say to you and your city
Y'all niggas will never get our respect again
Westside nigga (Keeping it real)
Yeah! (Keeping it real)

WESTSIIIIIDE!
Is Brooklyn in the house?!? (Check it out)
What about Queens in the house?!? (INGLEWOOOOD!!!)
Manhattan in the house?!? (South Central)
Long Island in the house?!? (Check it out)
Is the Bronx in the house?!? (Waddup)
Staten Island in the house?!? (Woop woop)
The West Coast is in the house sayin
Why you talkin loud?!?
What you talkin bout?!?

Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
Who wants to rock the microphone after me?
Think of who you are and who you be
My energy holds it down like the NFC
I'm going thorough thru your borough
Wit my Raider jacket and my jheri curl, gangstas rule the world
On the west, nevertheless, W-S
We got the bomb and you niggas got the stress

You couldn't have said it no better homeboy
With my automatic toy, I kill and destroy
These buster ass critics from the N-Y-C
Don't they know that I be from the I-N-G
My peeps play for keeps, deep crews pay dues
By murder ones and twos, rip riders and Damus
Choose to stay gangsta, you never ever ran us
We bustin clips like bananas, sportin colored bandanas
[WC}
It's the Mister hoodsta, cap peeler
Dusty ass New York critic killer
Dumping and pumping the motherfuckin lead in their chest
Because ain't none of them niggas ever gave it up for the West
So now it's on and, the gauge in my pants got me limpin
Fuck U-N-I-T-Y, I'm coast trippin
Saggin as a Pelle, smashin tape recorders
This is 187 on a New York reporter
""New York, New York""
""New York, New York""
""New York, New York""
""New York, New York""

Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
Tryin to get an East hip-hop monopoly
But I've been writing gangsta shit since '83
When y'all was still scared to use profanity
Now everybody wanna run and go and get triggers
And blame it on these West Coast seven-figure niggas
Just because we made it real niggas got to deal
I hope blood ain't got to spill, I kill

It's like the battle of the sexes
You wanna treat us like bitches cos we're platinum when we flex this
With mic in hand, fans in the stands
We make a mill-ion from California to Japan, bitch
Went overseas, seen D's how we done it
88's to 100's to let me know who really run it
This West Coast gangsta shit got it crackin, or we jackin
Packin nina's and sellin out arenas, niggas

You make me wanna holler, throw up both my Dubs
And roll these niggas up, I got to beat em
When I see me, T-Roller cut off his scrotum
Leave em bleedin in particles for them biases articles
I'm mashin and blastin so get the casket
I bet you after this I get a fuckin hip-hop classic
I'm banning you niggas from the scene
Kickin over newstands, pouring gasoline on your magazines

To the West my niggas, to the West
To the West my niggas, to the West
To the West my niggas, to the West
We the best my niggas don't stress
Fuck all the critics in the N-Y-C
And your articles tryin to rate my LP
Fuck your backpacks and your wack ass raps
Sayin we ain't real because we make snaps
Sellin six-fos to the Japs, what you lookin at?
With your Brooklyn hat and your pen and pad, nigga
I got a pocket full of green busting at the seams
Fuck your baggy jeans, fuck your magazines

Hey hey hey, what's happenin round tre?
It's still N-Y critic K on mines all motherfuckin day
It's a trip the script flipped from when you niggas was bossin
Got to flossin, fell off, and got the nail in the coffin
Who wanna regret, fuckin with my set
I be a 24-year street Westside Connect vet
You niggas better watch how you greet us when you meet us
We packin heaters and the only way you beat us is cheat us

AIIIIYO!!! Nigga fuck that shit
I gotta, kill it kill it, fuck a New York critic
He write about how I lived it, did it, plus I'm still with it
Puttin it down on all these DJs, hate, fakin and flakin
Never once played my record on their radio station
No love for a New York critic or disc jock
Matter of fact I'm blamin all y'all for fuckin up hip-hop

Is Brooklyn in the house?!? (Check it out)
What about Queens in the house?!? (WESTSIIIIIIIDE!!!)
Manhattan in the house?!? (And it don't stop)
Long Island in the house?!? (YEAH! YEAH! Check it out)
Is the Bronx in the house?!?

About five-ten, two-twenty with scars on your thighs
And that's they type of ho I want down with me
So bitch get your ass in and let's rob the whole city

Did I mention I think about you when I'm benchin'
And runnin' my trigger finger all through your extensions
It's intense dreamin' of a black picket fence
His and her 9's, teach you how to rhyme on the mic
You Tina, I'm Ike
Know you ain't a dyke cause you seem to like
The way I lay pipe
Keep it tight let's put this mattress to the test
Yes, I must confess, I got some prior arrests
Fo sho you know we're goin' westward ho
Can you handle
Half a chicken in the door panel
We at the mo' with a four-O and a joint
We got high, fucked around
And missed the drop off point


I put it down all around Westbound is where I'm headed
Since I keep my heat leaded if you trip you get wetted
We be huffing like hogs nigga who can see my crew
No better yet me and you nigga what you wanna do, fool
Cause all I do is wreck from the hip I teck
And when I come from the shoulders I straight Westside Connect
I got chickens by the flock I got the block on lock
Around the clock I sell rock so ain't a bitch I can't knock
So handcuff your trick if she's a good lookin' ho
Cause dog I run with niggas that the Fed's is lookin' fo'
They wanna get at us because our pockets is the fattest
And bitches be jockin' us because we got the baller status

I want a janky bitch, a janky bitch
A bitch straight down
Penitentiary bound
With the qualifications of a ho like you
C-sections tattoos stretch marks and bullet wounds
A rough bitch in a beanie the type of bitch that's down to do
A drive by on my enemies
Like Mary J. you're all I need
When I'm in jail the kind of ho that's down to keester me weed
Fantasies of you and me I keep
Having 'em at the park smoking on a hump sharing a tall can of Magnum
Fucking in the back of the coup let's get it cracking
So pass the stick and tell me ho what's happening

That ain't down no mo'

Y'all don't know how we puts it down
Trick ass motherfuckers
It's goin down

Let's make it happen, nigga, fuck rappin', I'm bellin'
With three time felons, nigga, who you tellin'?
Doug Llewelyn that a fool sellin
Thirty-six ounces what that amounts is
A whole chicken finger licken is the rumor
Catch a tumor, you say I'm dickin' my consumer
Suede Puma's as I walk down Florence
With warrants that don't go to court in Torrance
Tonight I'm buzzin thought I wasn't
Mack 10 and W.C. is like my blood cousins
Eleven strikes from armed robbery to stolen bikes
A nigga likes your motherfuckin Nikes
I shift gears when I see tears
Fuck a record, fuck a movie (Fuck 'em)
I rack my uzi
On bougie niggas that pretend to be friend to me
We the dopest niggas on Hennessy in the industry
I hit a lick well, I'm in a thick cell
Gold teeth, two motors and pig tails
And when I hear ""Westside Connection""
I get the fuckin' erection

Fuck what you sayin', fuck who you tellin'
I'm only bellin' with some three time felons
Nigga, fuck what you sayin' and fuck who your tellin'
I'm only bellin' with some three time felons

Rollin till the wheels fall off
A nigga rollin' till the wheels fall off
Westside rollin' till the wheels fall off
A nigga rollin' till the wheels fall off

I gots to handle mines, so I grinds
Real O.G. parolle, we throw the woop on the quarter key
Ain't been out but a minute
Nigga, in it to win it
'Cause a five year joke leave yo stack dented
Got my pockets back swollen, Motorola holdin
A nigga got the whole hood rollin
BG's get you what you want when you need it
I got them little niggas all posted up and heated
Hogs put it down nothing less than a fat knot
Niggas callin Mack's spot, jackpot, the crack spot
Got the double up bomb can't wait
So won't you bounce rock skate
To where the cluckers hibernate
Where we livin' like stars switchin cars like they leases
Servin' ten pieces to your aunties and nieces
While the loot keep me blasted from Inglewood to Van Ness
Tatted Westside Connection on my back in Old English
So, nigga, what you wanna bet on a set full of vet lick hitters
And, ain't a crew that can get with us
It's west coast, the most, I be yellin'
Nigga, Mack 10 bellin' as a three time felon

Fuck what you sayin', and fuck who you tellin'
I'm only bellin' with some three time felons
Fool, fuck what you sayin', and fuck who you tellin'

Westside rollin' till the wheels fall off
A nigga rollin' till the wheels fall off

Niggas are best to duck when I'm unleashing these clips
Thoughts of manslaughter got my finger on the trigger
Fuck a peace treaty, it's on with all you niggas
Cause ain't no contaning me when I'm ringing these motherfuckin' heaters
Causing tragedy
Tearing off your whole chest cavity
Mobbing through the neighborhood, nigga
Twenty inch bollters, fresh house shoes, hair-rollers
Lenny wanna kill me cause I got 'em all scared of this
Cutthroat janky enviromental terrorist
Stickering my tapes hoping that they can silence me
Cause I'm a nigga that's yellin fuck society
But ain't no stopping this westside click
So, tell that bitch Delores Tucker to suck a niggas dick
Cause I'm punking mo niggas than Deebo

The gangsta, the killa and the dope dealer
Got 'em', look nigga, you fit the description
This is dedicated to potential victims
Because crucifixion ain't no fiction
Too much bitching, get your ass beat into submission

To all my white niggas, to all my light niggas
To all my dark niggas, I'm trying to spark niggas
I want to shark niggas, Not to mark niggas
Fuck the park niggas, I want your heart niggas

The hood most honorable, carnage, geronimo prank nigga
Prosecuted for making your brain splat nigga
And Crocker sense is the westside nickel
Jim Brownin' you bitches off the back of a window, yeah

From O.J. to MJ and Michael Tyson
They fucked up Saddam like my nigga gangsta mind
You don't have to be a Taliban to feel the baton
Throw up the W, victims of the red, black and blue

I kicks in the door, waving a automatic
I'm mad as fuck, breathing hard as a asthmatic
Attitudes unpredictable, behavior is sporatic
Could snap at any time, and right now I ain't had it, bitch

Make no mistake about it, your life has just been threatened (echo)

To all my white niggas, to all my light niggas
To all my dark niggas, I'm trying to spark niggas
I want to shark niggas, Not to mark niggas
Fuck the park niggas, I want your heart niggas

I'm cockin' the hammer, fuckin up the camera was working on things
Like Kobe they trying to throw dirt on my name
Mo money, mo drama, but nigga fuck the hype, flash the light
I'm Dub-C connected to the afterlife, c'mon

You look hard, act hard, in the backyard
Front yard, lunch card, but the nigga run hard
I run yards, punk guards, nigga so large
If I get caught, nigga no charge

Here come a westcoast gangsta in khakis and creases
Plus a pink slip nigga, you punks is leases
My white Bentley got peanut butter guts like Reese's
Blood peeled niggas is red like an endangered species, fucker

In his age of terror, fear is the killer
One thing remains constant
The Westside motherfucking Connection
You might as well keep it gangsta
They've got us all under surveillance
Bitch you know the side
World motherfucking wide

To all my white niggas, to all my light niggas
To all my dark niggas, I'm trying to spark niggas
I want to shark niggas, Not to mark niggas
Fuck the park niggas, I want your heart niggas

Extremely aggressive gangstas turned businessmen with one single objective
World domination, or in their words ""Creating a world wide Westside""
Vowing to make every man woman and child bow down
To the ""W"", a hand sign used by their members to show affiliation
We have confirmed reports that ""W""'s have been appearing on the various
Monuments and historical landmarks throughout the world. There are also talks
Of Mount Rushmore being renamed Mount Westmore, with America's forefathers
Being replaced by the WESTSIDE CONNECTION forefathers, Ice Cube, WC, and Mack 10

And when the meter read red all cowards get took out
Back with more firepower than before
To us a nuclear bombin' is just a drug war
And I got no gangstarizm and stardom
And got niggas shakin' that ain't even from Harlem
Spit rapid fire down in the whole place
And it's hard to breathe with duck tape on your face

And these niggas keep winning, so they must be sinning
Cause all they do is party with a whole lot of women now

Handsome with a pocket full of randsome

You Gotta Have Heart,Terrorist Threats,2003.0,"What don't hurt ya
Will only make you stronger
In this game you gotta have heart
This hustle will break you down
Pull you apart

Homie, the same thing make you laugh, make you cry
And in the fast-lane the strong survive and the weak die
That's the way the ball bounce and I often wonder why
But I nease it all
And not just a piece o' the pie
I used to hope and wish for everything I couldn't buy
I was a young ghetto-boy that grew up in the eye
So I bowed to be a hustler and reach for the sky
And not only am I ballin'
Right now is mo' ta'

It's like a jungle sometime
U gotta hustle sometime
U gotta use your mind, mouth and your muscle sometime
U gotta grind
Stop looking for a saviour
Use what the fuck God gave ya (flavour)
I'm in the gutter-lane
Whit the gutter-mouth tryin' to get out the gutter
For my life's gutter-out
If I was White and called my mamma a bitch
It wouldn't have took me this long to get this rich (I know)


I was raised
The young nigga was scwabble
In the city o' looks
No hope or role-models
The black sheep o' the family destine to feel
Predicted to spend my hole life in a jail-cell
Fucked up and not believe in the hype
I know I would be more then a felon
I zoomed up and see the light
Nigga, got my mind right
Nigga, got my grind tight
Now a nigga is gettin' paid to skip
Skip to the lime-light

See, we all got problems
But some need addressin'
And so at night I hit my knees and thank him for my blessings
And ask him for forgiveness to minimize my stress
Nigga, continue to know how to dodge this Smith & Wesson
And with his help I will perform in my best
And it's still hard with all this temptation and testin'
An' if I'm wrong
Just accept it as a lesson
As I conquer all my enemies
And mashing with aggression, Lord


Ain't never been shot like 50 Cent or 2Pac
Cuz' 2 shots is too many
Too hot to go in me
I've rather sit remmy
In the back of this Bentley
And only fuck with niggas and you bitches that's friendly
Don't forgive what's so femmé
Fuck with my penné
I pull out the semmé
Put ho's up in Timmy
Just fuck it - it's Babylon
And nigga might have a bomb
Just like the Taliban
But I'm on never lan

I sit alone in my fo' corner room
Loadin' ammo
Cuz' in these streets life there's a gamble
Like Run-D.M.C., times is getting harder
So I'm taking of my gold-fandelellin' to the author
Old nigga say to young killers awaked you
But when you got it
Only few homies stay true
This game it's like Russian roulette
We hustle to death
Mash for weather
Make the devil marker for cheddar

 
Yo!
Won't you just stop fuckin' wit' us?
You know what I'm saying
You take what you got
I take what I got
Just stop fuckin' wit' us!

Had on my bussines, get my money and don't get me no problems
And everything gonna be alright
(Whooa, pimp the system)
Because it ain't easy man
It may look glamour to you cause you see me ridin'
Snake skin down to the floor you hear
Platinum shoes and more
Diamonds on fingers and watches on arms
I'm telling you it may look easy baby
But you gonna have to work hard
To get to this point
See you at the top

I never pimp a ho, nigga pimp a CEO
Be my He-e-ro, make me mad as ze-e-ro
Im that ne-e-gro making it like itchy-ro
Ain't got time for no bow ass bitchy ho
Go to G-e-sale fuckin with them e-e-mails
I'd rather get my shit wide nigga e-e-mail
Fuck a sex slavior make what I just made
That bitch had to sell her pussy for a decade
And that's too much time for the brainy one
I'm on a daily run
To crack your cranium
Wrap uranium
Ain't nothin else
I pimp the system
Bitch break yourself
If they got scrilla
Then I'm gorilla
If they figure
I'm a killa
Cause I'm a nigga
Your prostitutes wear high heeled boots
My prostitutes wear three piece suits
Count your money nigga

Pimp the system cause the game is grossing
Everyone listen to what we're proposing
Quit the quickness, we'll trick the system
Skills that will impress'em and make these labels victims
Ho no longer
No more hesitation cause our game is stronger
Taking over
On top of the world they'll never take us under

Bitch I'm a pimp
Mack daddy looking for the dollar
And at thirteen I drove a 6-4 impala
Gangsta
Young motherfucker full of izm always dicking
I don't kiss them, twsting, pimping the system
So vp's and presidents wherever you are
Just cut a fucking check and I can bring you a star
Then read up on the deal, make them throw in the car
I got a young lawyer bitch she just passed the bar
See I'm a pure rare pimp, but I told them I got
Young homie pussy don't pay you like EMI
Mack find the ho
Then sign the ho
Then put the bitch out and steady grind the ho
Hit the radio jack and then just like that
Bitch bring money back when the ass on the track
A pro watch them come
And I watch them go
And if you don't pimp the system
Then you's a ho, whoa

Pimp the system cause the game is grossing
Everyone listen to what we're proposing
Quit the quickness, we'll trick the system
Skills that will impress'em and make these labels victims
Ho no longer
No more hesitation cause our game is stronger
Taking over
On top of the world they'll never take us under

Bitch better have my money nigga I'm starv-o
I'm hard on the game like I'm hard on the cold
I treat rap like a trick
Nigga the tag on the bitch
Wrap through you rich
King Kong
The can of the bitch
State your order
Wipe them off and put them on a corner
And if she good
I take her on tour bring me ebona
I'm a rider, gangsta, wall spray painter
True banger, got nam-e, taking out enemies with my fingers
Now feds and undies when the gummy thristy homies
Looking funny I converted the street like the rap money
And now is all about the benjis and with this pen
Like pussy I pimp this lyrics like pimping cane
Leaning in my cadillac
Buffing on a De la Hoya checking ? for neighboors and high power lawyers
Cause I don't trust a bitch
I'm trying to stay way rich
Break the bitch nigga
Break this bitch
Pimp the system

Pimp the system cause the game is grossing
Everyone listen to what we're proposing
Quit the quickness, we'll trick the system
Skills that will impress'em and make these labels victims
Ho no longer
No more hesitation cause our game is stronger
Taking over
On top of the world they'll never take us under

My nigga Mack said
Pimp stands for put it in my pocket
So that's what I'm gonna do
While ya'll thinking about bitches in corners
I'm thinking about the beach and coronas
You know what I'm saying

Pimp the system cause the game is grossing
Everyone listen to what we're proposing
Quit the quickness, we'll trick the system
Skills that will impress'em and make these labels victims
Ho no longer
No more hesitation cause our game is stronger

Superstar,Terrorist Threats,2003.0,"While your shuckin' and jivin' I'll be drivin'
Rollin' in my SUV (Westside Nigga)
All my plus three thugs on the way to the club
And when I come you got love for me
Cause I'm a super super star (Staaaar)
You know we're super super star (Staaaar)

Everybody know jail records sell records
I'mma catch a case come to court nigga bail naked
I got the formula double murder equal double platinum
I know these bitch niggas wonderin' why I'm bustin' at em
The rich and famous ignoramus
It's kind of heinous with the picture of the world that he paint us
The most dangerous angriest lyrics that a thug got
Ain't enough nigga, where your mug shot?
Where's your drug spot nigga yous a was-not
I can't bump your shit if you never was shot
Before you bust a verse nigga go snatch a purse
You ain't my dogg till you laid up in a hearse
And you'll learn about loyalty when the record company
Try to fuck your family out the royalty
Your number one with a bullet and you took it in the back
Goddamn that nigga can rap


Now break me down check my resume tell me what it say
It's the hood or nothing cross em out and put a K
No NO it don't matter how good you spit
If you ain't hit the trauma unit they ain't playin' your shit
Who gives a fuck if your money and game up to par
Cause jail time and bullets make a nigga a star
But it's a shame you ain't gettin' no real ass figures
Got these white kid fools like you some real ass niggas
But most of ya'll is cowards ain't nothin' like me
Cause I'm a Westside motherfucker Inglewood G
And fuck sellin' records if I gotta get murked
I'd rather put my hustle down cook and cut up work
And it ain't but a few real killas and scrappers
And all these so-called gangstas really backpack rappers
And I can care less about a battle with skills
Cause when you bump Mack 10 you get the real reel


Fucked up down the game is fucked up now
This new rapper got shot and looked up now nigga
Fuck a peace service soon as Dub hit the surface
I got em shakin' and nervous cause ya'll done created a murderous
Brazen tattoo so blaze the zag fool afraid the gat you
Got my gauge right at you
Fuck Paula Abdul I'm an American Idol
With my album cover posin' with a semi auto rifle
Cause murderin' vital cells and steels ain't real enough
The media wants drama so I ain't givin' a fuck
If I kill me a nigga won't get shot in the heart
I can hit the countdown to one-o-six and park
So bang this shit nigga hang that shit
You say you don't but I know you love this gangsta-shit nigga
Cause bullet holes and record sales go to together
Like cops and radars, ash and A&R


To all my niggas lovin' chicken and watermelon
Talk broken English and drug sellin'
Rap murderous lyrics and story tellin'
You got to be a felon to get your shit sellin'
And if it got to be that way
A nigga murder me a rapper today
It just happened today
So if I come clappin' your way
It's just to sell what a nigga sold back in the day
Bang this and my niggas get dangerous
Bang this with a four five stainless
Bang this and the bitches go brainless
Bang this if you want to be famous
Bang this and my niggas get dangerous
Bang this with a four five stainless
Bang this and the bitches go brainless
Bang this if you want to be famous",https://genius.com/Westside-connection-superstar-lyrics
Izm,Terrorist Threats,2003.0,"Yo, somethin dangerous man... (gangstaa...)

Woooo, do you wanna pimp wit this guy
Do a buck on a ninety-five
Run with them hookers when they payin sheen
Talk of sex-appeal, I was born gangsta...
Shittt, don't play wit me, and in the game I'm as real as they come
Do the math, baby, out of the sun
Even a susperstar, Cuz I'm a gangsta...

Now let's get one thing straight
You fuckin with a nigga thats liable to catch a case
I'll turn ya birthday into your worst day
Bitch I'll have you on a high-speed chase on the first day
Umm, try 'n throw, I'm so, affiliated
This greenery got me sedated, I'm feelin faded
Hood life, the life of a robber on chrome wires n switches
A nigga wit mo' crimes to riches
A ghetto jumpstart, Post it up with the tiny homies in my momma's front yard
A hood pioneer, can't function without the smell of gunpowder
And fish fryin' in the air
I'm a sheist nigga, Check for ice nigga
Bitch, You got the wrong nigga if you want a nice nigga
I'm Dub C, fuck a MC, catch me in a MC on a buck twenty, Bitch fuck wit me...


Some bitches don't believe I can spit that 'Izm
Till they wind up wit dick all in 'em
Till they find theyself pullin' off denim
Intoxicated, off this venom
I kick game, big game, Nickname
Insane, Ice Cube spit flame
Yall niggas gone feel it down-range
Body feel strange (Blah!!) No brain
I'm a throwback, that know how a gangsta do it and a ho' act
Get off tha dick if you don't wanna blow dat
Cuz bitches treat the bozack, like Prozac
Now there's Gangsta-ism, and tribalism
I'm only fuckin, wit survivalism
Fo-fo to the do' is my religion, Now wha's yours
Pray, before I bust yours...

Wooo! La la laa la la la la la la la, gangsta...
Wooo! La la laa la la la la la la la, I'm a gangsta...

Every time I come around bitches starin at me
Point nigga Mack 10 from the Dub S-C
Wit a L.A. fitted hat and a fresh white tee
Fulla flair and pizzazz but I'm a straight up G
Cocky cuz I'm rich, look good and I know it
But I'm confused on what to be, a deep boy or poet
Head is mandatory, bitch, there's so much to blow it
If I do fall for you I refuse to show it
So if you think I ain't pimpin, Man that shit is absurd
I stay hard on 'em, fulla 'izm, fuck what chu heard
You say you down for me, shit but thats only words
Wanna show me love bitch, I wanna play wit a bird
So regardless of the weather, bitch don't get the chedda'
And keep big daddy ridin' two-three's or betta
Wood on the dash wit the peanut-butta' leather
And like that Al Qaeda love we can blow up togetha', Holla...

Get outta pocket, We might just whup yo ass
Pull out a rocket, We might just take yo cash
And when I cock it, We might step out and blast
But we ain't gon let that bullshit pass

I used to be a young phenom, Like lebron
Now I'm doin shit beyond, Geghis Kahn
Peon, You can't pass on deon
The best rapper in the world ain't a european

Look, Respect my gangsta, Nigga obey
And I been rich since my first pro day, Ask O'Shea
West ridin is my fotay
And will the hustle ever stop? Nigga, No way

Niggas can't fuck wit dub s c
Gang related and leavin 'em leakin like stds
C-Walkin out of the sc, Lettin the tech breathe
Till I rest in peace, Dub gon rep these streets

K Mac is the one, Nigga fuck neo
No love, Hit 'em up with the dub wherever we go

Oh, You know that nigga pimpin ken? That's my hero

Atomic, Demonic, And off that chronic
It's Ironic, How I flip them phonics
So fucked up, The product of reaganomics

Shit, I heard the price of yo done went up
My gun buddy had a drop, So the pistola went up
The heater hot, Nigga burn ya skin up
The fo fifth hold a dime, And I shoot all ten up

I'm about guns, Fuck roses, I breeze over parole
Some man captured some folks, The locstas never fold
Bacon soda aromas, Niggas swingin chrome motors
Dickey bombin folks and shootin out of stolen automotives

I got diamonds on my fingers and watch on arms
Stay out a nigga way and you won't be harmed
If I catch a bitch, I'll see for sure she'll be charmed
When I'm rollin through the hood, A nigga heavily armed

Shit, My life is like a rap show
I'm out the back door, Beyatch, So beware of the strap, Bro
Cause that's how my blast go
Ice cube is an asshole just like castro

Nigga, I spit Flames, Leave permanent scars
Connect gang bang and we g's about ours
And ain't shit changed, Still stripes and stars
And I'm done already, Ain't got but 4 bars

Holdin it down down down stoned down bustin rounds
Dub, Ghetto rich nigga since bow down
Squad down, Sendin flicks to my niggas locked down
Doin dolas in streets wit my ragtop down

Yo, Write a book bout a nigga like me
I got loot like an athlete just signed wit nike
You lose ya life if ya ever get sheisty
Could mac ever run out of snaps? Not likely

Heh, niggas be like wonderin' where the Ice Cream Man been
I've been down south countin' my marbles, nigga
But I got two sides
Damn, it feel good to be back in the Yay Area, I mean, the Westside
'Cause these muthafuckin' West Coast Bad Boys
Westside Connection, Ice Cube, Dub-C, and Mack 10
Nigga, y'all know the Westside is bout it bout it
Bust on 'em, Mack

Ice Cube

It's the I-N-G-L-E here to trouble you
W, double-O-D, see me
I take this gangbang shit the whole mile
Beach cruisin' on hood patrol with my flag Aunt Jemima style (
Yeah
)
I throw my set up, I wet up, nigga, I wreck up
No hollow points so I don't jam the TEC up, dawg
I move the cavy or yay to parlay
When niggas trip, I spray, then it's anybody K all day
Shit, I'll trizzip to my clizzip, who wanna fuck wit' it (
Who?
)
Since the world is a ghetto it's like I'm stuck wit' it
Killa Cali is the state murder
Every day, kiss the homie, lay my rag in the casket and retaliate
Nigga, who is you? What side is you - red or blue?
I gets my dump on, I regulate the turf I stomp on
Every time I see some, I grabs me gun
Redrum, redrum, and Inglewood is where I be from
Boom boom, bang on, I bust back, fuck that
Loud strings in my Chucks and a maroon velvet golf hat
I let holsters hang loose, no truce, no tamin'
Westside niggas fo' life, it's gangbangin' (

What do I got to get high for? What would I lie for?
And what would I die for?

You got to know, keep the Calico by the bedside
It's what I'm all about (Yeah)
Now which one of y'all muthafuckas shot up my mama's house?
It ain't no rules when you ain't got nothin' to lose
And a gang of tattoos
So throw your muthafuckin' set high in the air
If you don't care, to ride in wheelchairs
Watch what hood you select
Many niggas get checked for the tat on their neck
We got the cannabis bombay, G-ride Hyundai
You best'a pray we don't find out where you stay
Lookin' at my mama through a glass window
I've been in L.A. before it was called South Central
Makin' niggas like you statistics (You)
While bumpin' The Stylistics, and
I'm loc'in', smokin' that yerman as a youngsta
Now I'm feelin' big and strong as Herman Munster
It's the set I threw up, the only way to go (Westside)
It's the way I grew up, the only way I know, fa sho
It ain't about Crip or Blood (No)
And it'll never die (Never), because there's too much love

That's why I'm keepin' my fingers on these loaded clips
'Cause we done served two of them, and
Ain't no tellin' when them niggas gon' hit the gate
And try to retaliate (
Never know

In my affiliation to the Gangsta Nation
I'm hard on them, yeah I'm ruthless
You like a stress sac, boy you useless
You know the side trick, better get up on it
Cause it must be a single with Nate Dogg singin on it
Look check this out man
We got a Gangsta Nation goin down over here
So ya'll might as well bow down
And join this Westside thang man
Cause once you get with this
Partna you as G as can be

A Threat To The World (Intro),Terrorist Threats,2003.0,"The threat to the world is not over
As we speak, our futures in grave danger
Ice Cube, Mack 10 and W.C. are... MASTERS OF GANGSTERISM
A group of organized street thugs turned business men:
The Gangster, The Killa, and the Dope Dealer
Through out the western hemisphere, connection cells are multiplying faster then anticipated
World domination is a true reality we must face, it is... upon us
Now's the time to fight for what's precious;
Capitalism, Materialism, and Imperialism, our world must never fall in the hands of the WESTSIDE CONNECTION
So what the fuck we gonna' do now
What the fuck are we gonna' do now

Lench Mob 'til I die if the world ain't ready for me
It's that Big Swang affiliate, got ya feelin' it
Like 10 inches of ashey dick in fresher pussy, a nigga be killin' it
Peep the delivery, what I'm deliverin', more than the average
Parental Discretion, Dub is a savage
I'm harder than Michael Jackson dick in a daycare
And I'll beat a rappin' bitch up too cause I don't play fair
In the throne I sit, with a jar of Vaseline jackin' off
To my videos cause I'm on my own dick
Gettin' my jerk on cause y'all niggas ain't gangsta
With them tight ass Mel-donna v-neck t-shirts on
Fuck all y'all, I'll put the slug in through your chest

Swervin' through L.A. and surplus hanky wavin'
Swangin 'til infinity cause niggas can't fuck with me lyrically

Concrete safari ass nigga, the kind to reach back
And slap all the S-Curl out you R&B ass niggas
Haters won't say it but I'm one of the greatest
The most underrated, Dub fall off, I can't see or feel that picture
You got a better chance catchin' me in a Blood gang meetin'
With Clay Aiken, Johnny Guild and Little Richard
Believe me, niggas can't see me, I'm the king of the city
Sippin' on Henny, fuckin' my competition if any
Lights out, any nigga around me pullin' the mic out

Bow Down (West Coast Classics Radio),West Coast Classics Radio,UnKnown,"The world is mine nigga get back
Don't fuck with my stack the gauge is racked
About to drop the bomb I'm the motherfuckin' don
Big fish in a small pond
Now the feds trying to throw they book at the crook
But I shook they worm and they hook
Guppies hold they breath. They want to miss me when I'm tipsy
Running everything west of the Mississippi
Its the unseen, pulling strings with my pinky ring
We got your woman, pucker up 'fore we fuck her up
Bow down before I make a phone call
Got 25 niggas running up on y'all
For the cheese we want them keys
Everybody freeze on your knees, butt naked please
Before any of you guppies get heart
Nigga! Rewind my part fool and....(Bow Down)

(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you (Ooh!)

I take ten steps and I draw (Blaow!)
Now who's dissin' the mad-ass Inglewood addition
I bust like a pimple, my mind is elemental
The Westside connects with me and South Central
And a drag from the Zig Zag can't fuck with the Phillys
Holdin' down the wild west like a kid they call Billy
Once again it's Mack 10 the gold crown holda
Strong as a Coca-Cola with a chrome pistola (Brr!)
Now who wanna fuss so I can buss when I cuss
My look bring you fear with gear from the Surplus
Since a teen, I chased the green, the crack-scene king
Lolos, Corniches and baguettes on my pieces (Ugh)
So recognize these real Gs, chase the cheese
The Westside Connec' keep it rolling like gold D's
Three-wheeling and dealing, it's like the California style
But in the meanwhile, in my town, you got to bow

(Bow down) When you come to my town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Because I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

Well it's that, Chuck-wearing, still sporting the beanie
The shadiest nigga in the clique, who want to see me?
As I slide my Locs on, let my khakis hang
Westside Connec' gang, Connec' gang, bing-bing bang (Westside!)
Run away, run away, or get your punk ass slayed
By this H double O to the D to the S.T.A. (Ahh!)
Fuck hiding it, I'm gang-related, simple and plain
Which means I could give a fuck
About you niggas in this rap game (Ugh!)
Flashy niggas get stuck up (Ugh!), beat the fuck up (Ugh!)
When you come around, keep your chain tucked from this...
Zero-zero-apostrophe S shit
Fuck a studio lyricist, I'm real with this (Yes!)
Talk the tal,k walk the walk
Diss me on wax?
I'm trying to saw your whole fucking head off, nigga
I'm platinum bound, so bitch, shut up
And nigga, all y'all could kiss my Converse like Sho Nuff

(Bow down) When I come to your town
(Bow down) When I'm westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz I ain't a hater like you
Bow down to a nigga that's greater than you

(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you

Yeah
Ha
Let me tell you something
Gangsta's make the world go round
So you ain't got to clown
But if you live on the west side of your town
Make them other fools bow down
Westside Connection
The world belongs to us

Bow down
Bow down
Bow down

(Bow down) When you come to our town
(Bow down) When we westward bound
(Bow down) Cuz we ain't no haters like you
Bow down to some niggas that's greater than you (Fool)",https://genius.com/Westside-connection-bow-down-west-coast-classics-radio-lyrics
