Wait (The Whisper Song),U.S.A. - United State of Atlanta,2005.0,"Hey how you doin' lil' mama let me whisper in ya ear

And I'm known to be a real nasty man
And they say a closed mouth don't get fed
So I don't mind askin' for head
You heard what I said, we need to make our way to the bed

That might be a lil' kosher to deal wit
Wet fat hoes, they don't spill shit
I keep a ho hot when I'm puttin' in work
You wanna skeet-skeet, you 'bout to get your feelings hurt
'Cause I beat that cat with a dog
And knock the walls off a broad til' she squall
Like (Ooooooooo!!!) Yeah, it's on like that

Salt Shaker,Me and My Brother,2003.0,"Shawty crunk on the floor wide open

Shake it like a salt shaker (shake it like a salt shaker)

P-Popping till you percolate
First booty on duty, no time to wait
Make it work, with your wet t-shirt
Bitch you gotta shake it till your calf muscle hurt
Say the heels on your feet, strap around your ankles
Jegga jegga jegga
Call that bitch Bojangles
Juicy like fruit or douche like coup Deville
Lucy get loose on the goose for real
Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got 10 then bring a friend
Ho shake your ass till the song end
If you ain't wit' it, well go on, then!
We ain't no boys, we grown men
If you ain't gonna dance, well don't then!
Why you wanna waste a nigga's song, then?
Sittin' your ass down doing nothing?

Work it like a game that you playing to win

16 bitches in thongs in 1 club
The home of the thick, redbones and big butts
Game spittin' bitches splitting all on the floor
Bonafide, can't deny it, certified pro

69ed plenty of times to pay her bills
By day she's a clerk, by night she turn stripper
You're not even dating
You just trying so you can tip her!

She got me hype, I wanna bite it right now yi, yi

Anybody down for my nursery rhyme riddle?
Some of these hoes be for the creamin' in the middle

She shakin' ass and gettin' paid, because she makin' her cheese
She ain't scared to get on the floor to show her ass and titties
If she doin' it quite right, I might just give her fifty
I've be drinkin' Hennessy, so I'm damn near tipsy
I know them hoes in the club, they ain't twerkin' for free
If she dancin' like she should, she'll make her money
I like them freaky ass hoes, twitchin' asses for me
Ah shit, that's it, so I'm spendin' my cheese

Pull My Hair,U.S.A. - United State of Atlanta,2005.0,"Hey you
You know you been talking a lot of shit
Whispering in my ear
Making me feel all, hot and bothered and shit
Making a mother fucker horny
You say you can fuck? Prove it

Look bitch
You done talked a whole lot of shit
But wait 'til you see my dick
I ain't really for the talking game
You done came in the room and started handling me things
First off with brain and I'm a beat the pussy up
Hit it from the back and beat the pussy up
Girl why you fronting
Doing all that running
Be your ass still
Long dick coming
Now ride on the dick like you were dancing in the club
You really love attention, so show them some love
Now come up slow and just ride the head
Now drop down fast, put it all in it
Now turn your ass around an let me hit it from behind ya
Put big dick inside ya
I'm a hit it from the back while I'm pulling your hair
You climbing up the wall while I'm pulling your hair
Getting freaky than a mother fucker sweating
I'm all on you
You all on me
Fucking like dogs
Me and shorty off of the walls
And I like it when she play with the balls
Shorty ain't holding nothing back at all
Ain't scared to put the mouth on the dick
She swallowed it!
And she like it when a nigga be pulling her hair
Talking nasty to her ass while I'm pulling her hair

Now that I got you in the bed, I'm gonna pull yo hair
Snatch yo ass up by the head, I'm gonna pull yo hair
Pull my hair (pull it hard) Pull my hair (pull it tight)

You said I beat that pussy from back so much that I hurt yo side
Yo ass should have been built for the war (yeah) Fuck it!
And if you don't want to wear your tail
You need to put it in your ass and tuck it
I whispered, just to get you in the bed
And now I'm fixing to pull your hair on your head (pull it)
Shouldn't've fucked with me, should you?
If your ass could've ran you would've
But you put that there a side
That's how my dick got between your thighs
Now that's all right
I got a ten foot pole
That'll go in your hole
Take yo soul

Fall all on yo clothes",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-pull-my-hair-lyrics
Bedroom Boom,U.S.A. - United State of Atlanta,2005.0,"Listen baby, sometimes I know I be playin
But set aside the bullshit, I'mma grown ass man
Whats to understand that I love to fuck
Can I hit it from the back or put ya ass in a buck?
Screamin Shawty what's up, are we fuckin' are what
We ain't got nothin to discuss I'm simply tryin to bust nuts
The temperatures risin', We reachin the bed
Ya eyes begin to roll in the back of ya head

Bangin' Headboards, The loud noise, The sound of you screamin
Turn me on cus it sound like you singin'
Sayin my name constantly, Sayin' daddy keep fuckin me
Get it how you want it long as you keep lovin' me
Put ya thing down
Boom the bedroom do it right
And it jus might be a long night, Alright
Now be Quiet you don't want them to hear us outside
Let me get on bottom while you ride

Bedroom Boom, (Thats whats goin down tonight)
Bedroom Boom, (Let me do ya body right)
My bed will be boomin' for you... (boom boom)
Bedroom boom, (All between the sheets baby)
Bedroom boom, (I wanna drive you crazy)
My bed will be boomin for you

It feels like heaven when were off in this room together
I Can hear the music playin, then I hear ya voice sayin
""Ohh daddy now jus give it to me right there.""
""Ohh baby, Take a handfull of my hair.""
Cus you like it rough (rough) can't get enough (nough)
Cus I'm the type of nigga thats gon fill you up, like a cup
And make this love thing overflow
I won't stop until ya body's tellin me so
Sheets gettin' sticky from the strawberries and whipped cream
If these walls could talk they would say this is one hell of a scene
Now you movin ya body jus like a gymnist
From the bed to the dresser, All type a' crazy shit
Case is tellin me stories, Body's hot and so horny
Hittin it from the rear, Wanna wisper somethin in yo ear
""I'm gonna love you all night... I promise.""

My bed will be boomin' for you
(My bed will be shakin' til' the screws come loose, while I'm off in it)

Boom goes the bedroom, Behind closed doors
And the bedroom depends on how far things go
You move slow or move fast when you off in that ass
But you hittin' that mothafucker like everytime yo last
Spread yo legs like a bald eagle, Work that back
Move like a snake when you do dat dat
Now be quiet, You don't want them to hear us outside
Let me get on bottom while you ride

(Yea) Temptation got ya outta control
(Mmm Hmmm) You tremblin' like you out in the cold
You screamin' you can't take it no more

Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch

Aw nah, she ain't a ho, she just a badd bitch

I'm in the club, lookin' for a badd bitch
In the parking lot, lookin' for a badd bitch
Everywhere I go I'm tryin' to find that badd bitch
You know me, I gotta keep me a badd bitch
A freak in the mornin', freak in the evenin'
I'm looking for a freak when I'm done, block bleedin'
Now take me to a house, tease me, then please me
And tell all her friends how the dick made her sleepy
Believe me, when I'm up in it I'm beatin' it
Givin' y'all that Mike Jones treatment
I could tell by the way she walk that she got it
Body so deadly, you can tell when she drop it
I'm either gonna hit her or I'ma be assed out

Then crept up behind her, told her it was time to
Let a playa like me get in that vagina

I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line

In the club where she work and she poppin' that thing
Said the bread keep her fed and the head at the bar
She could barely breathe on a nigga dick and make him cum
Come, one (Come one) Come all (Come all)
Where them hoes like to get bucket ball?
If they can't take off they drawers
Ain't stayin' in there, nigga, naw

I love the way she dance, she look like she fuckin' herself
Shawty do a number just touchin' herself
Freaky ways, she can shake ass for days
Getting kinky in 69 different ways
Jump on stage, she get paid, singled off
You got enough money, she taking her clothes off
Look at that: I tawt I taw a puttycat
I did, I did, I did taw a puttycat

I'm lookin' for a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind

Shake that ass for the tip if you a badd bitch
Drop it down to the floor if you a badd bitch
Aw nah, she ain't a ho, she just a badd bitch

Bitch move, like you got somethin' to prove
Keep runnin' your dick-sucker, ho, you gon' lose
I don't wanna hear about your motherfuckin' blues
I'd rather see your ass clap-clap in them shoes

Wham, wham (I tawt I taw a puttycat)

Shawty gettin' crunk, love gettin' low
Love it when she take it to the flo', make that booty roll
Take her clothes off for cheese, love smokin' weed
And she getting hella freaky on the Ecstasy
Do her dance for me, song after song
Shorty won't stop, she goes all night long
Now that's a girl who know what she want in life
She a schoolgirl by day and a stripper by night

Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind
I need a dime, that's top of the line
Cute face, slim waist, with a big behind (Hey shawty)

And you get your heart caught up in a mess
'Cause you lust just to fuck what's up her dress
And never paid attention
'Cause you didn't think the girl would start trippin'
Shawty flip the script
Start saying all type of shit out of her lips
I'ma tell you what I can't stand
When a woman play the role of a man
Talkin' to a nigga like you got to hold his hand
Treat you like a spare, like you lack to understand
I know you know that I ain't gon' go for this jaw jackin' all the time
Talkin' to me out of line, broad, you done lost your mind
You gon' fuck round and get me some time

Before I pack my bag on you ass and dip
At the point of no return and you made it that way
By the shit that you say every motherfuckin' day
Hope you payin' attention, 'cause I gots to mention
Dissin' me in front of your friends
Tryin' to get a lil laugh in, joke crackin'
Then I wanna whoop his ass then
Hide behind your fake ass grin with your fake ass friend
Used to them fake ass men
Really ain't a man but you like how he pretend
I'm gonna keep sippin' my Henn and smokin' my herb
In my ear loud and clear with your naggin' words
The way you talk is absurd, gettin' on my nerves
All in my ear, got me 'bout to hit the curb

One day I got shot by Cupid
In the midst of this, relationship went stupid
We went from talkin' on the phone too long
To nowadays your ass ain't home
You always call, tellin' me you out with your friends
But I find out later on you with your other men
Then, you ain't in it for the dividends
Say you suck and fuck and you ain't gettin' nothin'
That's a damn shame it ended like this
Now I ain't got love for ya, bitch
Shoo fly don't bother me
Will I get back with her? Probably
Then I thought about it, I won't
Do I really want you? I don't
The headache I really don't want
So I'ma leave her alone, 'cause I can do bad on my own
That's why she gone

But you can spend your Benjamins
Make no mistake thinking she's your friend
This is all about dividends

Wait, she like to play games
And she don't care who she play wit'
She do what she do
And she gon' get what she gon' get
She hit the strip club
And she gon' make her money quick
Shake ass on the pole
Bes' believe lil mama thick

I like the way
The way she dance
She take the thug
Put them in the trance
She shake that ass
Like an avalanche
Look into her eyes
And you taking the chance
I see the fire in her eyes
Fire in her eyes
Like the way she moves
She got the fire in her eyes
Fire on her waist
Fire in her thighs
I love the scandal

She's so dangerous (dangerous)

Get crunk lil mama

So I spend the money to see it
I love them girls that belly dance
Drop it down low
And shake that ass

Shorty look like her ma
Remind me of a coke cola bottle

She a bad-ass broad
With her mind on the riches
So bad she pimp out bitches
All about that mighty dolla
You ain't talking bread boy

Nigga lips smackin' like he chewed bubble gum
Tell her where I been, what I did, who I'm with
Said he seen me with two bitches, that's when I said
I gotta stay the fuck away from Ed, I'ma

Smokin' weed by myself, drinkin' Henn by myself
Buckin' hoes by myself, I fucks with nobody else
Now red light, shawty started a fight
Just talking all about us, and whilin', its alright
I hate when my brothers, fuckin' up undercovers
Shawty, did I stutter? Go get another rubber
Shawty shakin' like blubber, shawty want me to cut her
Too many niggas in the house, time to get out
I get freaky in the back, while you play at your work
I'm hittin' the fat monkey, and damn your girl chunky
Hennessy what I need, I'm drinking all alone
On the phone with my B...L-U-N-T
Per sé every day, a White Owl, Optimo, Philly, or Garcia
Give a fuck about a bitch, what that muthafucka say?
Who gives a shit? Grab a bitch in the club
Show her love with a dub, and them niggas hatin' cause I...

Fuck running trains, that shit lame
I'd rather be one-on-one with a bitch gettin' brain
Too many heads on a blunt, nigga don't get high
I don't give a fuck if ya got five
Every now and then you chip in, and you wanna get Henn'
But you never got a twinny-twin-twin
Money don't grow on trees, Henn ain't cheap
Take it from me, you better hope you get drunk with a Pepsi
Uh, that's a beep, might be a freak
(Ay, lemme roll with you, folk) I ain't taking nobody with me
I'ma ride by myself, get high by myself, get drunk by myself
Fuck this ho by my goddamn self
'Cause don't nobody hold your own, like your own
That's why we on our own...

Now everybody say goodbye, get your hand that burns

One and two that's what you get
When you let a nigga lick that clit
Do you like it?  (Yeah)  Wanna a nigga to bite it?  (Hell yeah!)

Suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it, suck it

Niggas, I'ma tell ya, you can't trust a bitch far as you can smell 'em
You betta lick that stamp and mail 'em back over there to that other fella
(I care less) Like I s'posed to
(Always gotta stay fresh) Like I told you
(Don't tolerate that stress) Like I told you
(I punch a bitch in the breast) In the chest?
(Nigga, yes!)

I caught up with this ho she sucked my dick behind the sto'
And I spit all in her throat, then a nigga had to go, I had to roll
Then I'm lookin' for another headhogger
Georgia Dome, put your mouth on the dick, give me Georiga Dome
I love pussy, pussy is good but it always bleeds
When the time of the month come bitch it's your weakness


Fuck nigga, that's enough said
See a bitch is only good for a duckhead cracker
U-S-D-Grade A pure jaw jacker
Low self-esteem nigga came out mack her
Bring her to the world like a low-down nigga
(She the bomb!) You gotta pass a ho 'round nigga
(Here she come!) And all boxers fall
Shorty gon' play with the balls

Bitch please, I'm hotter than four-hundred degrees
Only time you use yo' mouth is when you get on your knees
So don't speak you shouldn't be sayin' nothin' at all
Cause it's hard to talk when a mouthful of dick and balls
So put it in your mouth and blow
Put it deep down in your throat
Nigga like me don't want to hear that shit
So do what the fuck you been told


I smoke by myself
I drink by myself
I fuck these hoes by my goddamn self
You smoke by yourself
You drink by yourself
You fuck these niggas by your goddamn self

I don't forget about them women that love to get ate out
You'll be eatin' Red Lobster she'll suck it out
That's a four-course meal for a nigga like me
I'ma starve cause I ain't gon' eat
Now I don't eat nothin' that get up and walk away
Somethin' I got look at face-to-face
I say, ""ew!  That's nasty!  Nigga if you wanna eat it you can have it.""

Get a stack of ones, show the girls some love
Taking off their clothes, working on the bubble
Droppin it to the floor, get your Christmas dough
Can you touch your toes, make your booty roll?
Call me Santa Claus, can I get a drink?
Tell a mama dance
If you want this money you got to do it with no hands
Girl, work your back, and the booty fat
Go and take it off, show that kitty cat, cause you know it’s that

Have a merry, merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
(Ho, ho ho, Merry Christmas)

, everybody , after dark
Everybody drinking egg nog
And we bout to hit the nudie bar
We bout to hit the nudie bar? We bout to hit the nudie bar!
We bout to hit the nudie bar? We bout to hit the nudie bar!
Cause we want Patrón, and a Redbone
Or a darker tone, it don’t matter tone, either way it’s on
Sippin sippin sippin, tippin tippin tippin
Ain’t nobody trippin
Everybody chillin but they steady get it
They tryin to get them presents for their children
Merry Christmas


Gather round the tree, gifts for you and me
Oh what do you know? Somebody’s standing under the mistletoe
Kids running around, presents everywhere
Joy is in the air
Everybody having fun, now we do this every year
Now it’s time to eat, so we family feast
Turkey everywhere
Everybody bow your head and let’s say a prayer
The whole family full, the whole family smiling
The whole family happy, the whole family wylin
Feelin like giving call it Thanksgiving
But it’s Christmas day so have it your way, okay?
Oh, what a good day if you 
So go ahead and roll up the purple weed


First , everybody looking
Do a , and tell the crew the crew is cooking
Pray this over here, yeah she hold it down
I’m lurking hands, gripping pots when they come around
The pile of greens on the snowman and they smell like heaven, they smell like heaven)
My purple cane here, plant the seed here
Because he said he had a cooler loaded full of beer
We went to drinking beers, and taking double shots
And looking all smooshed face like  I know , we kinda  I know we turn it down, the mistletoe around",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-carol-of-da-bellz-lyrics

Big boy poppin? cuz he make that bank hit bounce shit
I almost slapped his punk ass one day in the lunch room

Talkin? bout he need a ride, what kinda nigga need a ride?
They made whistle while you twurk, And thats functionin?
Ain't these some hatin ass niggas? Now look at this shit
I asked that nigga to run me up the street when he got that god damn Impala
He said nah, now that was some fucked up ass shit
Them ol? pussy ass niggas can suck my dick! (faggots)
(Verse 1)
Im goin? back mother fucker from the 6 zone
The same crippled mother fucker got picked on
I ain't never really have shit, holme
But a hard time and cold in my spit, holme
Now certain that wasn't workin? shit, holme
Man some label me a bitch, holme
The only plan is im bout to get rich, holme
If u don?t like what im sayin?, suck my dick, holme!
Poppin? pills and niggas droppin? and fallin? off the fuckin block
Some niggas doin? good and some niggas on crack rocks
Some of these niggas make a hell livin? in the game
Some of these niggas may try but it seems they can't
Cuz when they come down, they see this shit get hard
I know you try to be a man but that shit get hard
If you got it on your chest nigga speak your mind
In your ass get it wrong, you gon leave by nine! (Now)
I remember when that nigga D-roc?s mama used to be candy lady
That nigga had to go come strait home from school
And could never go outside and play
That lil punk ass boy, I always told him he wasn't never gon blow up in this shit
But he still wanna be in this shit and he start runnin? with god damn Kain
Like they were really gon blow up bein? the Ying Yang Twins
Them ol? punk ass niggas! (Where your handicap sign at?)

Busta bustas nothin? else but bustas
Glustlas on a nigga pinky make em mug us
Grills, my squad conceal upon here
Crips, they gats conceal upon here
Off the river deep down
With crip then be quietKnown from the east to the fuckin? west side
Nigga down to ride cuz im soldierfied
Never swallow my pride and you can check my height
Look nigga Im gon run your bone and try to get with
To put this shit in, now you shaken like a bitch
Fuck that shit, a nigga sayin you tryin to sound like me
So Im gon bust you in the lip like we shoppin? for free
And you?re at a low of words for a cat

Now he think he walkin? tall
Cuz he got that whistle while he twurk! ( I heard he still stay wit this mama)

Better watch out for them boys

Wherever I stop and rest, best believe Im gon to snap
You c?mon up in here now them niggas wanna hate em

You make me mad now im knockin? out your fuckin? teeth
We can take it to the streets, If you ready then its on
Beat you like your daddy then see your ass on
A dead man walkin?, a deaf nigga listenin?
A blind nigga lookin?, a crippled nigga flippin?

Thats some fucked up shit if no hand nigga slap ya! (Ha)
That nigga must be tellin? the truth cuz he a no hand ass mother fucker
Tried to slap me with that mother fucker but he missed
I already knew that mother fucker wasn't shit when he first said that shit
That ol? punk ass boy, And his god damn car he ever had broke down comin? down the street
That mother fucker just fell, that was some funny ass shit
Yea! And remember when we ran that punk ass nigga out from South Side?
And god damn he ran straight up to his crib in the complete other alley
How come this mother fucker hadnt learned yet
That was some fucked up ass shit, It was funny though
It was funny to me cuz this mother fucker think this other nigga gonna help him
And everybody started turnin? their back on himI already knew he wasn't shit and he never gon be shit and he ain't never gon mount to shit!

Treat a nigga good and wash a nigga draws
But bitches ain't shit, always talkin' shit
They wanna be tha shit, but is they shit? No
And hoes, they fuck off the goddamn chain

So that's a nasty hoe and I can't do shit wit it

Learn to play fair, stop tryin' to care

Tongue Bath,Alley - The Return Of The Ying Yang Twins,2002,"Yeah, (ohhh), we got the hood rats in the house right
(Would you like a tongue bath babe)
They say they like tongue bath (from the back)
So, uh, we went and got Methron
But of course, it's the Ying-Yang Twins
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Forget about that Summer we stretched straight thuggin it up
In the tongue bath world we was loving it up
I've been told by the eye we were holding each other
To the room, sexual, of the Isley Brothers
Sippin' Alazez and Hennessee, straight thug passion
Licking nipples, got you gigglin', so you started to laugh
And now it's getting so erotic baby
All of a sudden so I'm kissing on your body baby
Admit it babb
See baby a tongue bath is what I like
Lick me up, lick me down, curve my appetite
Let me open up my legs, show me what you got
The way you licking on my body's got me really hot
And I'm loving the way you lick me though
Do it little daddy, let your tongue take control
You got me shaking like hell when you're licking my toes
From the top to the bottom, make your tongue roll
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
The way you all on me, you get me feeling the heat
And when you lick it like that it make me grit my teeth
You got me grabbin' the sheets, and put the pillow on my face
Biting my lips and squeezing my waist
I'm calling your name and making that face
Cause you lick my bubble gum and had the taste
You got me caught up in this mist of the passion, you see
This tongue bath you giving me is like a fantasy
Baby please keep on moanin', keep on licking on me
You got me bitin' on your neck, look what this bath did to me
Now rub me down in your notion, with your deep freezin' motions
You bring the freak out in me, I'm out of control can't you see
You got me hot and now it's on till the early morn
Now this tongue bath, feed it to me, got me in the zone
Yeah
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
A tongue bath, from the back
Oh yes, that's the way I like it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)
Give me a tongue bath please, I want you all on your knees
I like it when you licking me, from the back constantly
You make me shiver little daddy when you're playing with ice
Turn out the lights little daddy, we can cut all night
I like it rough, if you tough, take it easy, that's enough
I want a massage with your tongue, make my body feel numb
Keep me hot, you know that spot
That feaky stuff you know I like
Ooh yeah, that's it, you're doing it right, that's tight
The way you licking me and kissing me
Hugging me and touching me
Rubbing me constantly
Ready to put your love in me
Do it like that, down from the back
Run a tongue bath, baby treat a hood rat
Slip and slide on my thighs, make your tongue glide
Baby when me and you collide, we'll make the temperature rise
Let me see you freak your body
I won't stop until you get enough
Anyway you want it, I'm with it
I just wanna get up in it
(You want a tongue bath, you need a tongue bath)

Haha, you like to get wet don't you
It's my way or the highway, ohh
Come on, for real
Would you like a tongue bath, oh
We ain't gotta do it that much, just let me do it a little bit
A little bit, just a little bit, it's all right
How low can you go, I don't mind
What you like, I don't mind no
If you're running you'd better catch it, oh, yeah",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-tongue-bath-lyrics
My Brother’s Keeper,U.S.A. - United State of Atlanta,2005.0,"They don't know how far back that we go (we go)
From riding skates, to riding 24's
From off the block husttlin to rockin shows
We done seen many bumps in the road
But still we remain, still in the game
Never worry, about them haters, that will never change
And I put this on everything babe
I am my brother's keeper

Listen D-Roc, I know you don't think I care for ya
But at a drop of a dime I'll be there for ya
And anybody want to see us apart
We need to get rid ofthey ass man and thats from the heart
Pick 'em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends
We seem to have plenty of friends
Excuse me then friend, let me borrow a stack
And when tomorrow comes don't ask me to borrow it back
If they can't do that they don't contribute to the answer
? ? from the ? serious as cancer
If I was JoJo dancer I would do the same thang
Not to let another man spark my flame
D-Roc is the ying, Kaine is the yang
But withoutthe both of us we ain't got a damn thang
Its me and my brother, my brother and me
All that you see on TV


United states of Atlanta its still me and my brother
We done been through a lot but still kain I love ya
Blood, sweat, and tears, good days and bad
From the time you make me laugh you made me mad
I still got cha back but I'ma take ya way back
When we was sufferin just to get a nickle sack
Scraping up change trying to make 2 dollars or 3
To get some 99 cent hamburgers to eat
And then ride thorough atlanta in yo raggedy car
Back then we was some underground superstars
And these last 5 years we done put work in
Now the whole world know of the ying yang twins
Even though we don't spend time at home together
We hit the road and its like we never left each other
Now thats love. I love you til the day that I leave
So its still my brother and me


People of the world we must change our mind frame
And stay away from the con and mind games
Its hard to maintain and stay sane at the same time
Steady working hard but you barely gettin by
Trying to make a line between stress and peace
And Satan always gettin the best of me
My closest of kin, my best friend
Man we all in the struggle but you gotta remember I'm yo brother
Listen people you need to start helping yo brother
Helping yo sister, mama, daddy, children and all
Dont leave these babies out here all alone
They don't know whats going on
They don't know right from wrong
So when you see yo brother give him a hug
And a shoulder to lean on and don't leave him out here on his own
Cause times gettin hard these days
We at war amongest ourselves and we at war overseas brother",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-my-brothers-keeper-lyrics
Armageddon,Me and My Brother,2003,"Armageddon (What!?)
Armageddon (What!?)
Armageddon (What!?)
Armageddon (Incoming!)

See it's the Ying Yang
And we a hazard
We're gonna get bumping up
And get ready for war
If we have to
It's a disaster
And we're them bastards
They don't know what slap a ho
Jack a ho
Crack a ho, forehead
Bucking we leave more dead
Destined for hell
We might as well
Be narrow bred
Fucking your health
We rearrange the game
Put that thing on your ho
Pussy popping, dropping and twurkulating
Ready to go
Now if you think we, think we won't buck, buck
Try your luck fuck, and I bet you get stuck
Much as y'all want to dog a broad
Little treat the ho
Never to be dull
And let her eat dough
And when you're me though
This how you greet the ho
This how you greet the ho
Hello
Naw I jumped off track
Let me get back to my subject
Y'all victims we suspects
Y'all talk shit we crack necks
We're bad, bad, bad
We're on fire
Fuck the man, man
Cause we all gotta die now
If you figure that you're bigger than God
I can't tell it
And if you shit a little bit in the school
You're gonna smell it
So all you niggas need to quit all that hate
It won't last
But a blast from gun
Player make you run fast


Look up in the sky
It's a bird it's a plane
Naw, D-Roc and Kayne
Who? Ying Yang
Faster than the speeding bullets
And we leap over ghettos
Came to take the rap game
For you niggas that don't know
Here we come come come
Better run run run
Saying 'don't want none""
(Saying ""don't want none"")
You better move
Get out the way and let a mother fucker get through
If you get ran over then nigga that's on youI know you don't want to see us cut a fool
Cause niggas like us be thorough bred
Thugs cold-hearted
Don't make us get retarded
Don't want trouble so you'd best not start it
Step off to the side when you see us come in
Two alley mother fuckers in your city again
We are on now guppy
Cause young ass niggas
Came to thing
And we always win
But you throwing a win
And let's all have a party
Cause we don't want to hurt nobody
We just came to have fun
Give me a bottle and a mother fucking cup
And if you feel what I'm saying get fucked up",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-armageddon-lyrics

On the streets i'm a legend, in my hood i'm a star! (8x)

Created in my back pocket
Ya ever know when it might rain
Streets are gettin it
You know the streets, they made it mayne
I ain't asked it for nothin
Cause it don't owe me shit
It taught me the game and told me ""go get rich!""
20 pounds in a rental car, headed to the Mack Town
T-Y told me ""get the work and make it touch down.""
I did that
Made that
Now i'm on my way
Just my luck
They know it's the texas license plate
Now i got a problem cuz them undercovers onto me
It's time to bail cause a snitch i will never be
I swear I'm like a fish
Greetin land with a kiss
Did i hit or did i miss?
Well it goes like this:

On the streets i'm a legend, in my hood i'm a star! (8x)

The hood made me what i am today my nigga
The hood raisin' up the beat is weight my nigga
First it showed me the game and then it showed me the money
Designed the code that i live by and told me to run it
So i start wit the shit plus i was born with the knowledge
A young wise muhfucka get respect like a prophet
Who can take the game plan, design a ride
And trust what's in my hand
And not what's comin out they mouth?

I'm a down low nigga so i stay on the ground
I push mills, push guns, push coke, push pounds
I got a nine-to-five, kobe, a.k.a. skinny, lil pusha in the hood
My brother went to jail and left me alone
Found out i had another brother
Pa was a rollin' stone
My brotha Eddie Banks taught me the street
My cousin Jewelz showed me how to rip up the keys
My other brotha Hut taught me to do it big
Connected to 3, you get a black hustlin jeep
Connected to gang shit, got the game sick
Money, power, respect, that shit didn't come quick!

On the streets i'm a legend, in my hood i'm a star! (8x)

I came up when Ice Cube was a young nigga
B.E. was rebellin, in the city with one high school
But now i'm a legend
I opened up for chris love and love and ludacris y'all
Seen niggas careers begin, rise, and fall
What's happenin y'all?
Well shit i ain't got no one to call
Like when yo ass didn't get no respect if you were in new york
I'm the nigga to call when in trouble
Lil red clay warrior
Got any nigga pick up the mic and i'm straight destroyin ya

Smoke some mary jane, you know the rules
Haters puttin salt in the game
Wanna keep a thug out the drug house
But you know the drill...a fro, polo
And a nigga in the club smokin dubs
Like a tru center thug
The big boy Willie Grill
Smoke swisher sweets, dont miss a beat
If a nigga feelin froggy leap
We ballin, shot-callin
Ho's holla'n, try to follow
When a nigga ain't ballin, sheesh
Still pullin on the hair
On my ching-ching weigher

Now back up, I know you dont want some muthafucka to act up

Throwin them 'bows, ColliPark know it explodes
Have a nigga feelin crunchy, smellin like toes
Ya know we had it from Georgia to Cali'
Doin shows from Virginia to that Cakilaki
Ask if are we lackin? Nothin, see we packin

Prison ain't a place that we need to go
So 'til they free Pimp C

You gotta hold your ground
Can let it strip but htey your friends in the eatership but
Why they always dip?
Left you by yourself stuck up f**ked up
Behind them bars, them times is hard
Thought you was smart

Jumping around the room giving yourself a bruisin'
Trying all types of suicidal tactics
The people walk in and put you in strait jacket
Until they free Pimp C
I'ma leave it up to U, G, O K K K

That's why me and my brother
Got Bun B to bounce wit us on this beat

A monkey on the rage
And the guard wanna spit in your face
Take your privilege away
But keep your head up son be brave
Don't let the worries of jail bring you down keep a focus head
And gain more knowledge instead
I know it's not where you wanna be
But take it from me I know everybody love to be free
So god dammit free Pimp C

Well that's what the f**k happened to me
With Pimp C, my right hand
My best friend
My ace boom coom, man we closer than ken
We've been on the grind, holdin it down
Till he got caught up in some bullshit, that got him some time
Almost lost my mind, started drinkin a fifth a day
Couldn't understand why they was takin a pimp away (Why?)
We right on the edge, we bout to blow
And dependin where a cat in his position need to go
Sittin in the cell watchin time go pass
Lookin at your kids and your momma through a glass
If I could turn back time I would of told him keep the Glock down
But now I pray for the day he may get out 23 hour lock down",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-23-hr-lock-down-lyrics
Long Time,U.S.A. - United State of Atlanta,2005.0,"Girl, Me and the Lods been friends for a mighty long time
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind
(Well oh oh..)
Up in the street and misguided never payed attention
So I got my soul devine, player's soul decided
To let my soul confide with the lights of him
Who the father, my bread and my water
I never bought a cue and into this (?)
Down in my world are you going let you hypocrits
It'll take your life to be a Christian man
I hope you learn, everything else
Is in vein so you're bound to burn
Gonna break your bone
I'm in a war don't let this life game over-rule
Trying take control of you
That's all the devil do
God was in Jesus, God is in us
But God ain't in the barrel of that pistol that you bust
You can play this game wrong, you gotta take it how it goes
Is there ever a feeling for living if the body's gone
I never understood why what can make a man cry
It can make a man strong when nobody's on his side
Girl, (girl) Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)
And girl, the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind
(Never crossed my mind, never crossed my mind, oooh)
(Well oh oh..)
Back and forth, night and day, you repeat the same scene
Standing at the pool a bit, time to repent again
Mostly men have a gun just put that down on circle purpose
When the poo of the world, got me standin by the circle
Agitate you, yes it does, this is what you though was love
Only name, same to be lust, mixed emotions make you wanna bust
Mamma tryin, children cryin, dad outta work, welfare lying
Prejudice, always see, the bottom of the barrel
Falling down on my knees, heavenly father, here we go on knowing
That we get to heaven, there's gonna be some open arms
Judgment was man-made, not a (..), and this I recorded
But I didn't live the party, but I thank that my heart beat
Gotta make me, oh sure Jesus I don't know if there's a hell
But I know I've whitnessed hell here, all I do is dwell here
Trying not to trail here, saying too much will get you knocked off or locked up in jail here
Tell me do you smell fear, knowing that we so near
Trying to take the voices of the truth, out the youth ear
And if you late a time frame, you play all kind of mind games
I ain't put my life on the line for a damn thing
Girl, Me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time
(such a mighty long time, such a mighty long time)
And Girl, (I don't really wanna be without you) the thought of leavin' you has never crossed my mind
(Never crossed my mind)
(Well oh oh..)
I can never make it, I can never ever make it
Without you baby
Cause you've been my best friend
Girl
When everybody turned their back on me
You were there when I fell down on my knees
And I give you all, all of me
And every part of me, oooowoooo
Girl, me and the Lords been friends for a mighty long time
(For long time, such a mighty long time)
And girl, (I don't really wanna be without you) the thought of leavin you has never crossed my mind
(Never crossed my mind)
(Well oh oh..)
I'm a live, I will never leave o no no
When the people say, c'mon and go with me
'Cause I will never leave you, and you've been my best friend
Nobody understand, but they can't look inside of me

Atlanta is the city
And they make it so seem
But ride through the city
And The Streets ain't clean
All I see is drug deals, big wheels and feinds
But any way they took East Atlanta back,(?)
Throw Atlanta Down
Turned little Vietnam to a white folks town
And fo, I forget to say you should have been fixture streets by MLK

But thats how it goes
When you stuck fuck outta luck and lost in the ghetto's

Let's get this motherfucker back crunk
It's gone be me and my niggas with hella triggers and a gat punk
To take back what we once had
Don't give a damn about them enemies
Send they ass to Baghdad
They put a nigga on the front line
But when it come to gettin' ahead
They put you way behind
And they think we supposed to take the minimum wage
They givin' us choices and makin' us think we free
When we still slaves
Every nigga got some thug in 'em
Every nigga got some love in 'em
Every nigga got a grudge in 'em
Every nigga got a mug in 'em
And every nigga bust a slug in 'em
And like the catfish we'll skin 'em (hanh)
Y'all niggas ain't holdin my denim (hanh)
Check yourself

I'mma drop yo ass off (yup) bitch (yup .....)
Soon as I loosen my motherfuckin' belt! YEA! HANH!

Talkin bout....them ghetto classics (ghetto)

We as black people done lost our mind (hanh)
It's really time to draw the line
Open up our eyes b4 we get left behind (hanh)
Let me tell you something bout hard times
When we used to walk or we didn't have license to drive
And 9/11 wasn't on our side
We didn't know how to read
We didn't know how to write
All we did was sing all day and all night (yea)
Then when they let us start learning y'all lose ya minds
Think y'all forgot about the earlier times
When martin luther king had a dream that one day we'd walk together
We really need to get it together
Kids stay in school
Learn all you can
Graduate
Go to college
Get knowledge
Then we shall overcome
Yes we can with the word and the faith I feel we can demand it
For real!


Hut 2 3 4 what the hell are we fightin' for?
Gas and oil
Relationships wasn't what you spoil
Thats why they got saddam
Hard time
Hoot (hoot)
Aim (aim)
Shoot (shoot)
Ain't nuthin' but the young kids they recruit
(yup.....)
Is the ones that dont make it home in they suit

I drift away sometimes
Thinkin' how it could should would be
If everybody in the world was free
No crime nobody doin wrong
Everybody gettin' along
But when I step back to reality this world is tough
And thats why we at war
Killin' ourself over bullshit that we value more than
Life y'all people better get right

Ohhh ohhh

Ohh ohhh

Say it don't really matter what your boss got to say

You got double overtime ain't nothin on your mind
Time to recline hit the club we gone rock

Ohh ohh
Ain't no sweat, gimme my check

The bass gon' vibrate in the trunk
The funk gone make the party hop

It's Friday it's payday
Everything gone go my way today
Everybody gonna hear what I got to say
I'm out this bitch till Monday

I'm off the clock
I'm turning the block
The club is the place where the party gone rock

You been working all week didn't get much sleep
Now today's the last day time to go play
Get your check get out that bitch
You know where to go to get crunk with it
In the club, get your drink on
Hit the dance floor, get your crank on
Party over here, crunk over there
Everybody hands in the motherfucking air
HOT!
But, you're feelin good
You ain't on the clock so it's all good
You have you a ball
You with your dogs
And the club packed from wall to wall

You just got paid
It's friday night
Hit the mall get fresh
Hittin the club tonite

In here till it's time to end
And saturday I'll be back agian

Have a blast
You through with your drink
Have another glass
Get your ass on the dance floor
Have some fun
You in the middle on the crowd nigga burn you one
They drinkin'

The weekend last forever
But when you leave the club you better pull yourself together
While you sippin and tippin'
You need to check your ride
Cause you you don't wanna get outside and catch a DUI
*Pull Over*
Warning
Fridays usually lead to high volumes of
Drinking, smoking, and partying
Please have a designated driver

You can't trust a bitch faras you can smell em'
You better lick that stamp and mail em'
Back over there to the otha fella

Always gotta stay fresh (like I 'pose to)
Don't tolerate that stress(like i 'pose to)
I'll punch a bitch in the breast (in the chest)
I caught up with this ho
She sucked my dick behind the store and I skeeted all in her thoat
Then a nigga had to go I had to roll
Then I'm looking for another headhunter Georgia Dome

The only time you use your mouth is when you get on your knees

She work that pole like a motherfucking bill
Straight lace no chase puts bitches in their place
And you notice she's a  so I bet you want a taste
She threw it back there, throw it back there
She make that pussy talk to me like what's happening

Boo-Boomerang booty, Boo-Boomerang booty
I throw that pussy, thro-throw that pussy back
Boo-Boomerang booty, Boo-Boomerang booty
I got a couple stacks to throw that pussy back
Ay-yeah
Back back back it up, Back back back it up

She's above , be on some freaky shit
Have you sitting in the club with a hard dick
She a hood bitch, and a sweet treat
I call her lollypop, 'cause she's such a good lick
She makes you loose your mind and have you come home broke
Have you sitting in the club like I don't want to go
You ain't got no money than get your broke ass home
In the club when the lights come on nigga go

If you clap without your hand
Go do your thing
If you 
Go do your thing
If you're popping rubberbands
Go do your thing
Go do your thing
Go do your thing",https://genius.com/Ying-yang-twins-boomerang-lyrics

Don't you ever, don't you ever
Make me spit on yo ass bitch!!! ahh-ha
Verse One:
Fuck them hoes, let 'em bounce
Known for kickin' bitches out
All they wanna do is sneak a blunt or two out ya ounce
Try to help us, with a plan guard yo grill and watch yo back
Bitches known for showin' other nigga's where you kick it at
Might be a hard head, might be a soldier thug
With a bitch got him sick, if he a sucker for love bitch
His nigga's better show him who unified
To get respect you got to play, watch them hoes step aside
Bitch! I'm just like you
Bitch! I smoke weed to
Bitch! I need gee'z so look

Now who the hell can they get to stop me
I'm in the projects ballin with my posse ah-ha-ha
{2x}
Verse Two:
Fuck these niggas who dropped me on my head
When I was younger, I did some wild shit

Round with these fuckin' lunatic's
You talk shit! You get yo wig split!
If you wanna try me!
You must be ready to die bitch!
I ain't scared to die bitch!
Ya see it's just a hobby!
By God-given talent I was gave from my birth
I couldn't let the shit go to waist
I had to put this shit to work
I'm just a ghetto ass nigga!
With the street knowledge I was gave!
You try to play it brave, can you outrun a fuckin 12 gauge?
Hell nah! hit a tree, had to go help him up
You shouldn't have never fucked up!
Now you lookin' fucked up!
Blew his head clean off his shoulder

Got away clean, like some Jean's when you wash 'em
Trill ass soldier's ain't no way you can stop us Bitch!
Chorus
Verse Three:
I be bustin' nut's on yo baby mama, baby head
Why you be gangster, somebody got 'em keep 'em fed
When I fed to the point where I be bakin' bread
I mean fed to the point where I be servin' head
Now look, that don't mean I'm try'na sound bad and shit
When I stab that trick, you can have the bitch
Grab yo bitch, you need to try to train yo bitch
Tame yo bitch, cuz she be runnin' game ya bitch
Now you all in a nigga grill, lookin' all swole
Picturin' how ya slipped off, trustin' in them hoes
No damn well, that yo Mom taught ya better cuz
A bitch will get'cha killed if ya let her

Came up with that yang on yo brain with that thang man
Lyric, killin, and drug dealin, riders, and soldiers
Comin out of Georgia, slangin wit that water
My other voice said ""hi"" today, so I gotta get high today
Tell my folks dont cry for me, just ride for me
And scream ""free me""
Fuck about some bunkshots, and what knots
And altitudes, my niggas she botilary
For bustas who be talkin shit

You wanna rat a nigga out to the feds (Fuck you)
You wanna flex you gon' bust my azz
Brang yo azz out doz, brang yo azz out doz
Nigga, brang yo azz out doz
You get mad cause a nigga jump fresh (Fuck you)
You got anamocity on yo chest
Brang yo azz out doz, brang yo azz out doz
Nigga brang yo azz out doz

It was this fly guy ? named frosted flakes
You should tramp on the hill, down by each lake
See you ran into this nigga, named suga bow
Suga bow was suga slim, with some long azz hair
Had this brawl on the strip, that was cuttin for chedda
She ?? freaky deaky bitch, met fruity pebbles
Up, another pimp, I hate to say it, green shirt, and blue jeans
Iced out, on the arm, I'm rollin, sayin you niggas gone

The mind murderer deep game, to talkin hoes out they clothes
It got me lost, gotta pay the cost, they say I'm off
Cause I'm a dead man walkin, deep dog talkin
Small time scracker, well be a thug trainer
Hangin by yo feet, yo bitch gon be with me
Because I'm known to fuck and gettin my dick sucked
So black yo wanna act up, you betta back up
'fore you get slapped up like biscuits
Sucked on like incense

You wanna front on me in front of them hoes (Fuck you)
You wanna go and try to steal my clothes
Brang yo azz out doz, brang yo azz out doz
Nigga, brang yo azz out doz
You wanna rat a nigga out to the feds (Fuck you)
You wanna flex you gon' bust my azz
Brang yo azz out doz, brang yo azz out doz

We just small the ball, we got a freak number
Will I call her? I don't know
Act a hoe, gettin' smoke, so I gotta hit the liquor store
And my folks, what you hittin' for?
Do you got somethin' on this endo?
You say you doin' better, but I'm one of the best
With the East on my chest, just stayin' possessed
Smoke that, choke that, that's what I say
Still the  on my eye 'cause they kinda red
Seen the popos actin' like, sittin' tight, man
See I swerve to the curb
Smokin' on that herb

Family,Chemically Imbalanced,2013.0,"I had a partner named Courtney, (DEAD!)
Pulled by a van, blood gone from his head
I had another partner named Terry, (DEAD!)
Tried to flee the scene
Before they hit'em wit the left
My grandma always said
When it rains it pours
Niggas dying like flies
Got me kinda scared to go outdoors
I had a cousin named Ant, (DEAD!)
They say the young man only died by the head
The streets all we got it
Boys gon' be boys
And in ya hype
Teach your son to like guns with toys
Now what we supposed to do
When you know you gotta get ya kid enrolled in school
So you start hanging round with the local crew
Have a smoke or two
Start kicking him a joke or two
Tell me what the parent's supposed to do?

Go tell momma (Go tell momma)
To go ask daddy (To go ask daddy)
Since when was the last time
We were a family
Like we supposed to be
Brothas and sistas (Brothas and sistas)
Achi cousins I love you (Achi cousins I love you)
Sometimes we as family
We don't do what we supposed to
So I say...
Familay-iiieee!
Yeah, Family

1979, that's when my momma had me
2006, her oldest son is a daddy
Check it
I got two daughters of my own
They say I degrade women
But they degrade they self
They didn't have help, growing up
She had a dead beat momma
And a dead beat daddy
She go and shake her ass quick, in the club
Drop it like it's hot
I tell my kids what to do
And what to do not
I'm a grown ass man
I gotta feed my kids
So I teach them the right and wrong way to live
If you feel bad
You need to stop shaking ya ass
And your parents won't be so mad
Might smile at'cha
If you keep shaking your ass in the club
Ying Yang gon' show you love
Listen
I keep stressing to my daughters stay in school
Learn all you can
Yes, I'm a real family man
HAAAAAANH!!!

Go tell momma (Go tell momma)

My Brother’s Keeper Featanwar,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They dont know how far back that we go (we go)
From riding skates, to riding on 24's

And i put this on everything man
I am my brother's keeper
Verse : Kain
Listen D-roc, i know you dont think i care for ya, but at a drop of a dime i'll be there for ya, and anybody want to see us apart we need to get rid of they ass man and thats from the heart. Pick em apart now that the ying yang twins got some ends, we seem to have plenty of friends. excuse me then friend, let me borrow a stck and when tomorrow comes dont ask me to borrow it back. If they can't do that they dont contribute to the answer ? ? from the ? serious as cancer. If i was jojo dancer i would do the same thang, not to let another man spark my flame. D-roc is the ying , Kain is the yang but without the both of us we ain't got a damn thang. Its me and my brother, my brother and me, all that you see on TV

Alley return of the ying yang twins full album (except playahatian),UnKnown,2002.0,"Walkin' round' town like I'm lost, sittin' in da house like a log
Nigga had to find somethin' out, playa wanna shine das all
Don't help to twine wit' mine so small
Nigga nigga nigga nigga please, hataz all around me let a nigga breathe
What a nigga say at the slip of the lip?
Man fuck dat bitch need to quit, talk about a nigga like a hoe
What they wanna hate me fo?
When a nigga step through da doe' conversation get low
With these type of niggas I don't need no communication
Cuz' playahation das so irrelavent next motherfucker that hate
I'm thinkin' bout' writin' a letter to da president
Swimmin' in da land of da lost, nigga don't sleep too good
Nigga tired been all off from stress dat can will, would, should
Probably could make a nigga ass go insane
Stay smoked out all day mary jane, niggas be tryin' to make me
Strain, hataz wanna put a chain on my rang
Get a nigga mind off track and worry bout' you givin' my shit back
All ova hea need to stay ova dea, you got yo' own stay outta my hair
Niggas and bitches is both da same they lie, steal, cheat, fuck, suck
Trick, and all dis then they in yo' face wit' dat I love shit

Why the motherfuckers wanna hate?
Need to get out my way, let a motherfucker come through
Do wha tha fuck I gotta do, dis don't concern you
I'm tryin' to handle my business, get on da good foot
You need to jump on da band wagon and not stand backin'
Cuz' errbody tryin' to get rich, buy a new house and shit
Make our way out da hood, like everybody should
But you up to no good tryin' to bring a nigga down
Spreadin' lies around town nigga like a fu-ckin clown
It only make you look bad, errbody jokin' yo' ass
It just make me laugh, make a nigga move on, made me write dis song
Now I'm in the fuckin' zone, tha list goes on and on
But they say two wrongs dat don't make no right
It just make it worst, I addressed it first
That's why I wrote this verse, probably say da truth hurt
I'm bout' tired of dis shit, ya need to let da shit go
Quit actin' like a fuckin' hoe, yeah it's time to grow
If you do it will show

Smoke swisher sweets, dont miss a beat
If a nigga feelin froggy leap

Ask if are we lackin? Nothin, see we packin

The foes see the gold and they dont wanna respect him
