ULTIMATE,32 Zel/Planet Shrooms,2015.0,"Ronny J, listen up

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (God damn)

Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (Ooh)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (Ooh)
Face, young boy done caught a case (Ooh)
Bang, now his mama livin' with the pain (Uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (Huh?)
Let him get the Senzu Bean so he regenerate (Oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (Damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (Esophagus)
Bitches be boppin' it, bow down and pop it in
Droppin' it in her esophagus (Esophagus)
She get so nasty, in public she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (Uh)
Girl, I can make you a star (Star, ooh)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (Damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (Flame)
Rippin' through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (Damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (Harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
Bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate
Bitch, I'm

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)

Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (Damn)

Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, 
never knew my life
But yet the question is, ""Is he fake? Is he real?""
What the message is, 
chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, 
these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, 
call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty
Ridin' through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-ultimate-lyrics

People be thinkin' that I won the lottery
So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me
Out of nowhere try to fight you

Gotta beware of the wicked, the time will be ticking

ULT,Imperial,2016.0,"This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian,
 
bitch I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
Hollow-tips point at a copper' head
Drop a head, popping the Glock till the copper dead
But Bishop
 killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Boy, your whole life is a mockery
A militant mind of the million
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier
 (WOOF)
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating common denominator
Aftermath you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely
The same ones that inspire me be the same ones that wanna retire me, nigga

In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist
When I'm ghost, I'ma cut the line, now you outta mind
Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)

Y'all niggas ain't U.L.T. (Ultimate)

Mystical miracle, I build imperial
I'm analytical, why Lotto had to be off to the clinical
Now we're identical, black individual, no biochemical
Serve, fuck the cops they the opposition
And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant, they got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other
Don't know, where the fuck they came from
We the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
Better get caught with it than without it if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I
Put them on paper
, 
send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise up black fists as black as the raiders
Arming the gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian we the nation of U.L.T
True to you so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga

In the night time, keep me out of sight, it's the poltergeist

Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class bitch I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga that ain't nothing new
Yeah I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too
Yeah I'm a gook, looking like that nigga Buu

I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died

But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

But how this gook, ended up surpassing you?
Why you looking confused?
Made a hard album so what can you do?

Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best

Shoutout the Klan because that’s on the set

Lie and you’ll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck

Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head

I tried to tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I can be
Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Ándale, ándale, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like ""Dance On Me""
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit

When the karma come back 'round, don’t let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

Eyesight is a gateway
To a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet
On a airplane yelling, “Mayday”
With a good girl gone bad girl
Who went gay ’cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US
'Cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized
Put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised
For the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it
With my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)

Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States

Talkin’ about “let’s make it great”

Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when–

Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back ’round, don't let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

Uh, look, okay
Ba-aby, I’m a fool because I thought you would stay
Whether I win or I lose, they already think we dead
But they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head
I need to duck and not move (Yeah) I bust a move when I (Uh)
Find a way to get on and get up and get out the crib
I was just looking into the mirror
Tryna dislocate my fear 'cause you broke my heart
Let me dry my tears
So serious, I'm so neglected
In the wrong direction with a long erection
Got no protection but it's fuck the world
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side (Oh, shit)
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump with the one thousand
Come-come, here they come

Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more spartans
Lord, prophet, praise Muhammad
“Different Strokes”, Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
Precedent in abundance, President is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, 
pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' “fuck it”
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now we stuck, in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sinner, tell me, what's my real religion?
Genocide, Genesis, they say it's a new beginnin'
I'm a sinner, you a sinner, I can see the devil grinnin', damn",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-sirens-z1renz-lyrics
This Life,Imperial,2016.0,"Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 9 to 5
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed

She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

She told me that I wasn't losing her, that she losing me
L-O-V, -E, we outta gas, I'll see you in a week
Thinking that, you won't fornicate with niggas that you meet
But silly me, now we are the same, 
Cupid admit defeat
Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine
You were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died
Idolized you when I didn’t unite
You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now

You didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed

It's history right here 
(Tote a 4 and pour some liq')
Wassup my nigga? 
(I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen)
It's time to empower these niggas mane, do it for the city  
(This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live)
We got to give it to them raw though, ya feel me? 
(Knotty headed niggas)

Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
But they got jacked like MK4
Sub-zero, put a nigga on salt, iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cause of the death, no a NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch I can't be touched
Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas
Tote a 4 and pour some liq'
I'ma tote that stick until they send me to the pen
This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty headed niggas

Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party
Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy
My pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz
Rico's Story when I see the coppers
Gem golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm-tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition we made obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday, all of you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace

Get the product then we out the door
Mama I've been twistin' weed
And now it's time to lock the fro, blowin' dro
Call me knotty head cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the projects, know this life ain't meant for us

Put her on the team 'cause we both makin' dollars
Hit her with the stroke, get her wet like aqua

Hang with the bros 'cause you know blood thicker

To the memoir of my niggas, them
Most of them victimized because the daily grind
Crackers be bamming and sending them
Down to the county
Face down on the pavement
Blackland, Carol City
My visual it's the same shit
Still the same little niggas going to the candy lady
25 for that frozen cup
Crackers be thinking they trapping
Just post in the Charger until they are ready to jump
Jump out the jumper, no pulling your gun out
You better be sprinting the other way
Throw out the fire, get caught by the nine
Run through alley ways all in Cherry Bay
It's real in the field, either 
kill or be killed
Like BG
 so they got a grip on the tec
Took my nigga, Chynaman, took my nigga, PJ
And Trayvon, hot damn, who next
 
on a white tee?
Born and raised on the Zone 3
Blackland right by the 199
Pull out the stick
 if you 'bout that life
Seen niggas from the Four be toting that iron
Run down, catch a nigga by sundown
Or downtown when he think the shit is serene
Got that boy when they shot that boy
Then they put him in the trash when they slide by the Beanz
Swerve, soon as I peel off the curve
Burn the evidence then a nigga hide
Take 27? Nah nigga, fuck that
Let's take that chance on the I-95
Bumping that sickest shit with the vomit spit
And a 666 with a twist and twirl
If you survive homicide drive-by
They'll leave you with nubs like the Powerpuff Girls
I get so high, stay so high
Until I see the face of God
Welcome to South Florida
Let that AK rip on the whole damn squad

Posted sellin' green so not no mo’, cause a nigga is tired of being broke
And I’m tired of living off my folks

And my girlfriend bout to have a jit
Plus I don’t want him growing up saying that he never had shit
That he never had it but based on analysis
I never seen challenges, I look at his Roley I know that he flashin' it

Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero

I been seeing, watching cause these niggas got it in for me
Flexing flashy wrists is correlating with my golden teeth
Diamonds all around a neck and it came with a diamond ring
I done seen all kind of shit, what niggas do over finer things
That’s why I carry the nine on me that’s a three times three extendo, that’s a 10-4
Seen them niggas on the 191, but a nigga peep game on the 194
Woah, bending corners just to see if they followed us
Sweating bullets, heater under my cardigan
These type of niggas is known to be poppin' shit
Deep in my thoughts, know who the prophet is
Tryna to take my wealth gotta protect my wifey and my jit
Gotta set an example if you thinkin' I'm a walking lick
Never believed in lawlessness, but I could be with the shits
When I’m nervous it's dangerous, if the police pull up then I tell em I’m innocent
They tried to run down on us, pulled out the clip then I empty it
Lords of the dark and violent, just ended up on the pavement, quiet
This is the reason why niggas divided, pray to the lord I don’t get indicted
Send me all the way to Rikers Island, dead on the ground now he’s a carcass
That’s our guy, nigga, that’s our target
Let’s go get em

Sit yourself down, let us smoke up the ounce
Bounce till I'm leaking semen on your couch and then I'm out
Catch me on the zenith, from the Southern region
Federation is my motherfucking legion
, we don't believe in
False prophets, fake gods and we never trust niggas
Two rules in my house, no shoes, no fuck niggas
Catch me on the zenith, fuck a TV screen, bitch, let it die
Look at your reflection, and ask ""Who am I?""
I internally extinguish the evil so I look externally to a place I can see you and still
Catch me on the zenith, devastation several nations
Singing that my nation is the king, it's all praying on a better day
Love and hate shit fades away
Day by day, night by night, no iron, no sight
Catch me on the zenith like I'm Hercules and Xena
Or Trick Daddy or Trina with the victims of Katrina
When the levees broke, there was never hope
Turn the TV off, I'm out the door
'Bout to make some dough, on a lighter note
Catch me on the zenith getting jailed for misdemeanors
That's until I change the channel to an ad for Neutrogena

Just thinking aloud, ""The sky's the limit"", how nigga?
I'm in it now and, Still I Rise, and as crazy as it sounds we gon' get more high
Catch me on a zenith astral projecting to Venus
Woke up in a European with a singer
She said she just can't wait to get home and cook me dinner
Curry chicken for the soul, man I'm feeling like a winner
Swear I love that bitch
Catch me on a zenith, anything I say I mean it
Sorry if it hurt your feeling man, focused on my millions
Stacks piling past the ceiling, tryna get the future right for my future children
Like hol' that
Yeah, catch me on a zenith on the side the grass is greener
While I'm rolling up the reefer reeking louder than the speaker
Used to hate all of my teachers, now they in my bleachers
Cheering on my every move, now that I'm eating
Catch me on zenith channelling a fucking genius
While I 
catch the way
 these demons try to catch me while I'm sleeping
Won't slip, won't fall even if I did get back up and stand tall
Tell 'em suck my dick and catch me on a zenith bitch

Suspended, animation when my brain reacts
Don't belong in this world like I'm Samurai Jack

Dark & Violent,Nostalgic 64,2013.0,"Fang life!
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
Welcome to the land
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
What it's 'bout?!

It’s ‘bout a young nigga, running away from the moon to catch the sun quicker
Drug dealer, Nino with the steelo trying to sell kilos and grams
Settling angry stomachs up in his fam
So if that silver spoon on your plate, if you touch that, that's your fate
Don't have faith, Like Evans, you got to face demons to get to your heaven
The pimps is the prophets, not prophets for reverends, this is the lifestyle of a broke adolescent
So here's a lesson of a teen that survived Rikers
But shortly, his life had ended with a bullet that's made out of Midas
Touch

You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You ain't have a fucking name on the darkside
You ain't never heard no tales from the darkside
You ain't never felt the pain of the darkside
You ain't felt the burning flames of the darkside
You ain't have a fucking name on the darkside

Knew a young brother without a name, he was in love with his nina strap
And steadily schemin, barely sleepin, but dreamin of pretty bitches and beamers
But when he awake, he sees his fate
And his reality, to do whatever it takes to elevate his fucking salary
Any niggas a casualty, kill 'em, rob 'em
Then casually walk off into the darkness, it all started
When he was, welcomed into our fucked up world, the son of a fucked up girl
And his father was just a blur, 
his life had took a curve
When he saw his brother dead on the curb, due to retaliation
Of the gang relation, 
 he was young, a kid, a baby
And yet to realize the pollution of the nation
Now he 18 life in jail is what he facin'
Shit, murder was the case that they gave him
Shit, murder was the case when they raised him
Mind stuck in the all black prison
You think he give a fuck about the system?

(Car driving)
Nigga we gotta get this money
Damn right
We gotta get this money, I got the plans...
Everything's set up
Just got to go in there-..
Got the banger man, as long as you got the hammer man, we out
...Go by the book...
You ready to do this shit or what?
Yeah, yeah, 'this what I got to do

Out on the gank, rolling the dank
As he cased out the bank, 
 he was catching that shank
Getting loaded the stick, 
 trying to major his rank
Thugging was how he was brought in the paint
Rush the security, 
no longer pure was thee
Soul turned it cold for the love of the gold
Bust in the air, everyone hit the floor
Not giving a fuck, loc-ing off of the 'dro
Bodied a nigga
, riding in a dropped ‘Lac
Top back, cruising them twenty fours
So I went crazy, my vision got hazy
I walked in the bank, and I start to get bold
Clutching that pistol grip
The teller was moving too slow so I pistol-whipped
The bitch, he was twitching, bust at a civilian
And blasted the mag with no mask in the buildin’

Burn the fingertips off, replace the dental
Left the golden bullet magic in his coufie, no his temple
That’s engraved, leaving corpses
In graves, 
Glock 17 cutting fades
Barber,  we dumped the security in the harbor
Then we switched the identity, chose the name Leroy Carter
The bank teller looking short and squeamish
Steve pistol-whipped the bitch; she kept screaming
Shut up, ho, before a nigga nut up, ho
Steve said he couldn’t take the shit
So he took her to the back, then Steve grabbed the MAC
Then he put it to her head, and then he ripped the bitch
Boy, we gotta do a job or we might get toast
13 shots rung out and it left two ghost

Alaska in my heart so who gon' tell me that I give a fuck
Or what Goddess that I'm smashin' when I leave the club
Angel, soarin' through the dancefloor like a kokita
God damn, really when the mother nature got us up in my galaxy
Lavishly, livin' in the mansion where we play Grey's Anatomy
Doctor,
 
I am so proper, look at the posture
I'll cross her, and finally caught her but then I lost her
Found her, a close encounter, over-the-counter
I bounce her, I wouldn't play her cause I'm not Bowser
Arouse her, gave her a heart, drop dollars and browsers
Amped up, I think we stamped up, she's in my trousers
Wowsers, she's at the tower, peek in the shower
The flowers become the power within the hour
Cowards, spaces to outer, green as the outer
Glow, after I'm stickin' my dick in this ho, beggin' for mo', woah
Woah, slow down, she thought I was destroyin' her
She likes the way it feels when she's searchin' for euphoria

Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria
Estefan back in 1985
Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria
Estefan back in 1985
Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria

Shake that ass just like a conga when you get a nigga high
Euphoria, euphoria, I'm glidin' through South Florida
On acid tabs, shawty with a chick that look like Gloria

Me Now,Imperial (Streaming Version),2016.0,"It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

Everything is backwards mother's saying that I'm sinning
Close my eyes and say ""forgive me""
'Cause I know the devil ain't
Devil told my mother in the end that he'll be winning
'Cause the world is full of sinning
No your son is not a saint
Spirit of God and the holy ghost it was written in anecdotes
That a snake would try to corrupt what he create
Sick of facades and the horoscope I devour the antidote
Told my mother that I was spirited away
Monstrosity murdering masterpieces, I'm mutilated
Falling forever, fear and forsaken, incinerated
Innocence inferno when I'm no longer incubated
Welcome to the world whenever I'm reincarnated
Relying on the last breath, but y'all would never know
Rewind it to the last step, play me when I'm below
If heaven's set on fire that's the day they make hell snow
The devil want my soul and yet I'm telling him ""hell no""
It's still like this...

It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now

Everything is backwards ever since the new beginning
God has given me the vision so that I can see my fate
Blind can't lead the blind and if we try then we'll be spinning
In a cycle in position trying to find a better place
Lucifer, devil, the anti-christ taking light up out of my life
In the darkness, it seems to me there's no escape
Initially alter it into dark, place the pain inside of a pot
And then bury it in a spot where I decay
It's  death before dishonor I'm a hideous disfigurement
Who's dying from the envious evil trapped in Floridians
Came from the Vatican, kill off the advocate
Feeling inadequate, when a bitch nigga bleed
Won't even make it to see 23, years, fuck it I don't wanna be
Here, look at the time when I'm turning it back
On the clock and  my right hand making it tick
Life is a bitch, better yet it's a pit
And my hatred is everyday making you sick
Regurgitated, early stages, earn the hatred
Burn the sages, caught in mazes
Instigated, inspiration, imitations
Only here, reanimated, damn!

It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now
I cannot love 'cause it hurts me
I will be happy when I see the sun drown
I have transformed to the worst me
Infinite words couldn't curse me now
It's like my world is reversing
Even the pain couldn't hurt me now
Rewind the good to the worst things
Even my love has deserted me now

If Tomorrow’s Not Here,Imperial,2016.0,"Lights out!

If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears
Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
Apparently I will watch the whole world collapse and appear
No tears, my intuition tells me that the end is near
The only thing I should fear is fear itself
Learn that being afraid of God is being afraid of yourself
So go to church nigga, but I won't go cause I don't know
Where all the money and the collection plate go
If the church still owe, then you know, read your bible at home
I'ma read it myself, all the stories that I'm reading show me how to prevail
The guard came in the other day and gave me some mail and said that I got a phone call
When I get out we gon' go harder than Medusa, building stone walls out of human flesh
Dave Koresh, burn that shit down even though I'm not around
I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out

If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be?
Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see
If tomorrow's not here
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching

If tomorrow's not here, I write down all of my worst fears
Fear of loss, fear of change, fear of losing my peers
We, been afraid of something that is out of my control
Like a verse from Duckworth, make a silly rapper's butt hurt
Sodomized through the eyes of a troubled youth
Talking between the bars, you tell them within the booth
Way back in 2012 when a nigga was 22
Passed you the Tropicana now my niggas got the juice
For millennias to come, go Millennium Falcon
Fuck a hand out, I'd rather leave my hands solo
The smartest thing you ever did, Curry, was going solo
While I'm in the county blues, lofty bout to take over the promo for the fam
I'm here because I never gave a damn, like an angry beaver
Smoking dust and reefer
Live life, smoke a pound, even though I'm not around
I know you gon' hold it down till the day that I get out

If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
If tomorrow's not here, if tomorrow's not here
So are you it, or you ain't, or just claiming to be?
Either you're something, or nothing, or just nothing to see
If tomorrow's not here
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching
Let's all jump out the window
Before your casket get closed, and your ashes get smoked
Tomorrow's not promised but the coming's real close
Oh, gotta do a little soul searching

Yo, I'd like to dedicate this track, to my nigga Ruben Thompson and my nigga Darnell Butler
ULT, ultimately till infinity
We gon' make sure y'all niggas straight when y'all get out
Shout out to all my niggas that's been locked down
Rest in peace to anybody that ain't here with us right now
RIP Chinaman, RIP Lotto, man... RIP Bo
I wish all y'all niggas could enjoy the luxury that we've got right now
It's not too many real niggas left out here
Everybody is claiming they true but they show they true colors at the end of the day
Niggas is chameleons to me, just blending in with they surroundings

Up in Carol City, me and Lotto in the charger, when we slide two deep (Two deep)
Can't fuck with the south with a AK-forty-seven bumping T Double-D (Double D, nigga!)
First forty-eight, gotta say it one time, R.I.P. my nigga Bizzle (Bizzle!...,,,bizzle)
Kick, drill, ravish of a nigga think he savage, turn him to a popsicle
That's ""Ice...COLD!"", and my last name ain't three-thousand (3000)
Bad ass bitch on my t.i.p. (Tip Harris), she wet, like an everlasting fountain
Still a Hot Boy, ‘bout whatever like, Turk or Wayne, like a motherfuckin' Carter
Niggas water whipping, in the hot damn kitchen, like a nigga Avatar, or Katara
Remember that it's still fuck the other side, lurking all black, like that boy Plies
Snapping, like a fat ho at the Popeye's when she don't get the thigh, the chicken, or the fries
So nigga what it be? I can turn my shirt to a ski, fuck feds, not even ice T
Wanna come and ice me, like it's New Jack City,shit looking grim - no Mandy, Billy
Cross the chopper line bitch, you better bow down to a nigga greater than yourself...trick
Flow is immortal, so therefore I gorde, you do something of it for yourself...trick
From the 'Tre deuce, got to keep a deuce deuce, like a nigga lurking in South Cen-TRU (South Central)

I'm rocking about four types of polo, you peep that my style it must be Armageddon
Apocalypse stop, pop the clip, better bow down now it's all about power
Fantasy darker than Swishers, the wicked demented, get hit with the mystical shower
Now that's dan-ger grab, on the ban-ger, take down the empire bruh
In the hood jits robbin', like Williams,let's hope that they'll never doubt fire
Niggas be knocking no cabbage, no UPS person, so tell me what's up with the S?
Slithery snakes, with they slithery tongues, salivating salvations with shit on your head
Yes, Curry gone mash on these cowards
With shells to they back like they bowser, spit fire -  no flower
Get smoke, like the OG and sour then head up to Broward
You know when the bass turn up louder, 'bout loud as the dro, get to the door
I'm shroomed out my mental, like Mario Bros
I'm seeing the walls start to kaleidoscope, so I'm guessing that already means that I'm gone
It's quiet striking that, haters won't tell the truth in front of your face
Not the same time, not the same place, so they hate from a greater distance far away
You see them in person look 'em in the eye, and they say that wasn't the case

Got them bushidō blades 'cause the rims keep choppin'
UM for the swag to get Miami poppin'
You could smoke a lil' weed long as you ain't flockin'
Put Dade on the map, gotta stay with a strap
Stay away from a roach 'cause they raidin' the trap
I'm the Raiden of rap when they tell that boy, ""Finish him""
It's nothin' but fatalities, them crackers gon' sentence 'em, huh

Mystical Virus Pt. 3: The Scream,Nostalgic 64,2013.0,"Gold bullet that's trapped in his temple
Was just the beginning of a deranged mental
The mind wasn't simple, the man wasn't gentle
They bust out the brain but got caught in the dimple
To bust out the dental, the tooth full of wisdom
With black on black tints
, they jet in the rental
The young mane hearing the whisper of Sindel
With a gift since birth, if you answer this riddle: Who I be?
The fetus of a demon
Semen from the tip
Of the penis I'm the only thing
That you see when you're dreaming
Armageddon and aftermath
This may blog in paragraphs
Sit on a throne, full of X's and bones
Blowing smoke and I laugh
Turning sinners like you
Into my personal acid tabs
Let me put you up on game
I've been shot, burned, and stabbed, and
Still ain't deceased
I carry the mark of the beast
Now can you tell me
Who the fuck I be?
Damien, as the kid replies
Wine, red wine was the color of his eyes
Coughing a lot of blood like Piru, but he slowly dies
As his eyes close shut, in prison was his eternal life

And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein
And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein

He thought he wanted seven digits, the thickest bitches, the top position
Tried to make a profit off the poverty he lives in
Atrocities committed on the blocks that he got kids in
And now he pops prescriptions, he's in prison to suspicions
He fucked the Devil's daughter, now he pissed away forgiveness
Only sounds he hears are shots popping in the distance
Thinking that they coming, now he haunted by these visions
He knows that there's a dark, and a light, but he don't know the difference
He used to run around bangin', man, he love the shit
And now he sit around, waitin' for his punishment
Cops on some old beef, that's why he gotta hold heat
He's stuntin' like his daddy, even pops had the gold teeth
But pops went to prison back in '03
So lil man never got to listen to a OG
Never got to tell him other options that you don't see
So lil man grew up thinking prison where he supposed to be, Ugly

And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein
And now that nigga scream like he Sindel
Yelling 'suicide' in his prison cell
Running with them demons since the age of 12
Life's never a game, watch him cut his vein

For the scene, see the best is never seen
They say I lack in appearances, but they lack in experience
I remain quiet like I'm in constant meditation
Only way to get in my place is expert and constant observation, nigga
Never compete, much less be winner at it
Seven days a week, I found my sinister
I control my perimeter, patrol isn't giving up
Every effort you attempt never amounts to enough
They talk around you, but you know you can't give in
And you part of the system, so they treat you just like them
Every action is countered, so just don't disturb my zen
Every student with honor knows you must deserve lessons, yeah
I roll with what every character should have
That's why I'm equipped with a black suit and mask, I blast
Now it's silent like when the Earth had begun

So then you meet me at the helm

Like Zero, the pain is down to hill, my brain is made of steel
I crash into your soldiers like bricks thrown by Shaquille O'Neal
The coldest flow in the snow globe, my nigga, I'm lost in frost
I never went to college, don't even listen to Asher Roth
Sometimes I'm a butterfly, most times I feel like a moth
Kill my insecurities because they tried to make me soft
Kill off, you and your posse, if you cross me
Have you so shook you wouldn't even want to cross streets
Pardon me—niggas be Madison Square-guardin' me
You could be a statue and you still won't be as hard as me
Fuck the industry, I only worry about my artistry
Hard to see, R.I.P. my older brother, Lotto Tree

Speaking facts like 360 degrees drop it
Wisdom, you think you mobbin' but you isn't
Miami back to Richmond back to Cali
They gon' find your body in the alley
Ugly still the ugliest, Ugly still destructive
I'ma lay you down underneath the ground if you fuck with this
Head up in the clouds when the dutch is lit, puffin' it
I be acting foul for the fuck of it
Lately it's a lot of days I feel hopeless (fuck it)
It's a lot of days I'm feeling like I'm drowning in the ocean
Put your hands on me and your hands gettin' broken
When I hit the scene, it's like a goddamn explosion
Find me out surrounded by some shooters, they be young and old
Piffing looking crispy I got origami money folds
Ugly Mane, bars played, that blood in my veins be running cold
Running the game I be unopposed, short fuse, don't cut it close
Ugly Mane, bars played, 
that shit I spit be so morose
You better watch your mouth playa, I hit you with that lethal dose

Line up to the mind cemetery, now
What we don't know keep the contracts alive and moving

Widescreen,Nostalgic 64,2013.0,"Yesterday I had a talk with my reverend
About how I traded my soul to get a skeleton
Of Lucifer, so a nigga can mount it on his wall
Hella high, hella high so an angel can never fall
Smoking on the mystical chronic from a shaman
Disguised as Andre Young with razor blades under the tongue
Hopefully his speech impediments might call upon, petchulants
So he can rip the wings off Cosmo, and Pegasus
Eating Flapjacks with a cannibal Captain K'nuckles
Kamakaze, jeepers creepers, read the power, ate his tonsils
Threw it up, gave it to an asthmatic
Swapping spit with crack addicts, Complex magazine and mathematics
Dilated with the ganja and peripherals
I look at things as cynical, I put the fun in funeral
A misty, mystic, mischievous one
Burning papers of the book, Fahrenheit 451

Can you see what I see?
Look at life in 3D (Widescreen)
Can you see what I see?

Can you see what I see?

Can you see what I see?
Look at life in 3D (Widescreen)

Trying to achieve the same color as tile sky forest
I see everything like I'm Horus
So watch man, like I'm into Rorschach
STDs and bullets—that's what happens when them guns clap
Wickedly sticking these bitches, G', I'm Ice Cube Jackson
5 fingers of death, I'm packing
Something that will make you feel like a paraplegic
Paralyzed when folks no habla murder thesis
Told based god I'd give him a virgin sacrifice
And stepped into a Pantheon and said ""Yo, which one you like?""
Step to Aphrodite with an amethyst rock
Crystal, get it dog? nah that's a Shih Tzu
If you don't really get the moral of the song
Basically, I see crazy shit, when I grip the bong
So maybe right now, you know what that means
My eyes are dilated, all three, in HD",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-widescreen-lyrics
Pure Enough,Imperial,2016.0,"Baby

Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh?
Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Girl are you sure enough

February sixteenth, is the day I regret my birth
Most times I thought about ending it when I came into this Earth
Compared to Dracula, the man in the mirror I see is nothing reflecting on all of the bitches I got but none of them love me
Like the woman I donated my heart too without the surgery
Charity, short-term goals is longevity
Keeping it G is the key, and I told you that's the cure for us
When the tears fall down your eyes you ask yourself

Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh?
Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Girl are you sure enough

February fourteenth is just the day to repopulate
I never have no love south side of the Florida state
Love me for who I am, never love me for what I make
I travel around the world and yes I drove on the interstate
Niggas would though I was fraudulent? Everything is politics
When coal turn into diamonds people want to praise and acknowledge it
Always quick to polish it, but quickly let me go
Happened to that young nigga with the nappy afro
He died around the same time that Lotto did
Now it's 2016 and I know what the motto is and
I don't need no Aubrey Graham just to make a hit
That's just another view from my iPhone 6
Free Mr. Zone 6, I know Guwop is coming home
Just another Aquarius that you hate to the bone
You wanna be a thug, but you won't live in harmony
Lazy, I'm crazy I'm wishing that a nigga start with me
Last year just made a nigga less friendly, approaching my adversaries
I know that people envy, my soul is still empty
All I see is pussies talking shit with they homeboys
Thats a modern day Ren & Stimpy
Girls wanna be classy but still dress skimpy not giving a fuck simply
Then wonder why people think your an escort
Keeping it G is the key and you know that be the cure for us
Mirror pieces fall and reflect on your life and ask

Are you pure enough
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror bruh?
Or when you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us
You said you had enough
Are you pure enough?
To keep it real with yourself when you in the mirror cuz?
When you all alone girl are you sure enough?
Keep it G is the key and that is the cure for us

Spitting like a semi, only get me semicolon
Couple 0's like I'm Stanley Yelnats
Every flow is unmatched and I better get set, inhale
Finish 'em, finish 'em
Mess around with me and I diminish 'em all
Even if I ever did the minimum all
Even in Arizona, better killin' them all
Rogue one but I got a team wit' me
Bad man one got a ting wit' me

Different cities every week now

What state, probably lookin' bleep now
I was homeless, sleep designer sheets now
30 different missions, when I speak they listen
Couldn't find a soul she fishin'
Who the crew, it wasn't you, I know it's true
Cause you look like the opposition
Run it up, run it up, greatest ever, sums it up
I ain't have a lot when I was comin' up
Kinda made my stomach turn when I brought it up, wait...

A Day in the Life of Denzel Curry Pt. 2,Nostalgic 64,2013.0,"I do this for my niggas
I do this for myself
Enter my mind
That's all I can say nigga

Five in the morning turn to six
My life has turned into a bitch
With the fucking wettest clit in the galaxy
Rapidly tripping and rapping and snapping
And killing my niggas that coming through blasting
And looking for money
And looking for magic
We sticking together like metal and magnets
Lutrashious, me and Mercedes up in the condo
On the phone for nine months, we sparked the conversation
Enter the void, mind escaping
Racing, plus my heart rate went blazing
Ganja, as I ponder on graduation
Threats hit a nigga, the points where I could make it
Not a contract, could take what I created
Not on paper, my clan-name erased it
Down nigga, since day one, I never hate shit
Same nigga tat 2-7-5 on the pavement
Got highs and lows on one path of greatness
Eighteen years of life, larger than basic
Markese, Andrew, Darnell, et cetera
It's still my niggas, know things will get better but
Things take time, and all things change
Some people venture off and make they own lane
But the place is just the same from the F.L.A
But my cuzzo Chynaman got hit with the eight
From the clip
And my nigga William had his last trip
When he hung his self in his room
Roll up the spliff as I puff one, puff two for my niggas
Then three for the niggas that be hating
Nigga, I don't care, Aquarius Killa, the Mack
Talk your girl up out her underwear
Let me bite that pussy like a god damn juicy bear
Suicidal thoughts, I'm on my head to make it clear
Another life and day, hallucinate got me in my rear
Lamborghini dreams, Freddy Krueger is my shooter
Raider still the klan, but C9 is the future

Better tell these hoes, bitch I ain't Clark Kent

Because your body is just striking
Enlightening
Like lightning
The storm here, is quiet
I bite it
When hearing the moans and groans as I dip deep
Your knees weak
But don't speak
When my spirit
Is in sync
Along with you
I lust for you like London Jones
If you my ride or die
Would you ride or grip the chrome?
In a Mercedes Benz
With fine clothes we roam
Just like the traveler, no?
Til' we entered inside your home
Its known
That Denzel can give you the mo' better
Adrenaline rush
As I proceed to get you wetter
I bless her
Just like a pastor seeing someone sneezing
Good evening
The way you look just blossoms as the season
Spring
Meaning you're clean, which is next to godliness
Thank the good Lord he blessed the earth with beautiful goddesses
Dropin' it
To the surface, like a fallen angel
The devil has a new dress
My butterflies are painful
Tame you
So that I can pet the pussy cat
Soft and heavy moaning when I hit it from the back
Skies are looking kinda misty as the scene faded black
Both hands on the wheel ain't no such thing as turning back

You can search, the whole world
Just to see
And I'll pay, for your trip
Its on me
You might go, your whole life
Just to find
Out it was, a complete
Waste of time
Coz there ain't no one like me
Ain't there a nigga, there a nigga like me

It's just, you and I
And God watching over
Kissing on my neck and hands going down my shoulder
Closer and closer
You're feeling a little colder
My mind is saying stroke her but I wanna console her
Hold her
Love is in the eye of the beholder
She could be my Sade and I could be her soldier
Told her
Once when we get a little older
Hopefully we'll push a little baby in a stroller
Lower
Is the tone she whispered in my ear
She said ""I love you Denny and I love you near and dear""
Never knew Nasir
But the words were sincere
When I went inside her mind, it was like Revista Leer
I read between the lines
In her eyes I spot a tear
I uttered to her softly, girl you have nothing to fear
I kiss her on the lips
Then she told me to come here
As she climbed to the top
She became my chandelier
Not knowing
Created another life this very moment
The future of my very insistence's got me open
Its potent
Like the smoke, when its in my lungs
Its a fire in the air
With the greeting of the tongues
But none
Will ever come between me and her bond
So leave my sanctuary don't come back and don't respond
This my garden of Eden
But as one this is our temple
My miniature moral is more than just being central

You can search, the whole world
Just to see
And I'll pay, for your trip
Its on me
You might go, your whole life

I go to the bathroom then take me a piss
Brush my teeth now it's time to parlé
I call up B Money to open the crystal
It's time to go jet so I skate (open the door nigga)
I'm rolling and blousing and coughing these ounces
These money roll a whole 28
Took 8 grams
Bumping 99' jams reminiscing on the town last week
Talk about a cop cherry tops run a block
In a baja
 saying the youngin' had heat
Spur of the moment
The youngin' was dumb as he dropped from a fatal attack
On the 207 called 9-11
Hit 15 bullets to his back
Shit got whack
Everybody really on that but you just got to embrace it
Even on the churches like it’s braces

Staring and tripping
Look at the TV its Adult Swim
Dripping the lick from the LSD
Lucid I'm dreaming
On broader perspectives
Chiefing forever
Smoked out with Ciara
Right on 37, the hottest of weathers
November the 4th to November the 6th
On memory lane as my mind reminisce
On my dawgs
Why'd shit have to go the wrong way?
Young breeds falling victim to the fucking gunplay
No MMG, just a RIP's
And the channel 7 news
Popping on the Twitter feed
On the story about the beings
Yellow tape at the scene
Lead bullets to your jaw
Martin Luther King
She was only 18 hit got hit with 13
Be Careful where you go
'Cause niggas is lurking
All night, Poltergeist, Ghost
Tell me who I can't approach
Have all my dawgs drowning inside my head
As I wonder how Rodney King might stay afloat
Coast, dead
Gone off the shroom pack
Joints stay fat, like Joe
Have a squad terror at your door
Pour shit, head in the dead zone

Tell me who fucking with the boy
Back down 'fore a nigga get destroyed

Crackers be acting green like that nigga Roger Klotz
When there's no evidence
'Cause blacks irrelevant
Better scream fuck the world until it's celibate
Criminal element with revolution intent
Is a rebel, a-con artist with common sense
Is a nigga based on the skin, not ignorance
Is a bitch, obligated to suck a dick
Maybe not
Carol City Porters stay HOT
Eleven shooters caught up inside a weed headshot
Take photo, ended up in limbo
Oh no
Bringing out the Glock like Frodo
Golem, destroying the land like Sodom
Gomorrah, of eight twenty-six
I present you south Florida
What I see, clear as Visine
My brother ended up in a crime scene
Cops are the only ones on a crime spree
Cowards took my brother untimely
Tryna get a little face so niggas try me
So I’m coming at their scalp like Apache
Indians in the biz down the 32 ave
God damn nigga causing aftermath
What the fuck you know
I build, destroy
Motherfuckers can’t feel that

It's best you watch your mouth and pay attention to how close you get
Is they really feeling me?
If they is it's silly me
Jesus walks within the sea
But most people be scared to bleed
Like curse release some sacred need
Pain and grief remain in reach
Doubt you'll be restraining me
Give you what you came to see
No matter who you be's
My G there'll never be a change in me

Lately I've been trafficking the H
Trap's backed up like Sonic
Got a couple chickens in the safe
Got em waiting for whoever say they want it
Spend the bread and pull up in the Wraith
Kill a hooker pussy leave her stomach haunted
Get yo' ass the fuck up out my face
Your sloppy coochie wasn't worth the couple hundred
I've been fucking bitches each and every day
I might as well, cause I ain't stuck in jail gunnin'
And I'm indifferent to these bitches throwing shade
And in their face I'm there to keep on throwing money
Dirty thumper on my mother fuckin' waist
I got the tip for when the bitch get bloody
I got 'em messing up, I'm all up in her brain
Plus every other bitch in there they wanna suck me
Now they plotting on me, bopping on me, opping on me, I'm the one that got you homie
Not the phony, out to Coney Island styling, wiling, kicking doors, and robbing
Not a problem, bought the carbon, beg your pardon, there's a party, fled authority
Foreign forgies, whores and orgies, all them gorgeous, Bentleys, Porsches

Shell toes and Timberlands to the cement
Ten toes on the gravel grinding for a reason
Pulling out the region
I'm an archangel not a demon
See the narcs tweaking heavy fiending
Ten hoes want a bottle, fuck 'em on a balcony, I'm rolling green in
Pop that pussy leave it leaking
Now I pop a nigga, is he breathing?
You a phono Chapo, faking what you preaching?
You should get an Oscar acting like a bitch
Ye'en hanging with the clique
And it bust, we ultimate
Got a temper tantrum with the fits
You is not a shooter if you miss
These niggas leeching, fleas and ticks
Bitch I'm not a blood donor
Run the heat and lick that marijuana
Follow me to live another summer
I need to get it all
Stevie Wonder if you blind
Plugging that new state of mind
Niggas bugging in the flies
In the city, take you for survival

Break, dive in the flow
Intervessel when I drive in a soul
Imma have a ball with the glow
Kids next door, jits, stick it to the cold, wet
I keep that fuck shit to a minimum
Government ain't shit, never giving up
Six feet deep in a beat
When I'm digging up
Now you sleep, on the head, of the indica, smoke
Invasive with the parasite bite, light
Cause you wanna know what's in sight, foe
Dark as the evil, the evil
I do not change but I evolve
Bitch, Imma drop a napalm, bomb
Said that I'll ring the alarm, gun
Water elemental law, cost
Found it and let it get lost
Bitch, common sense, comments could miss
Treason and treachery, left in a trench, trench
Aborting into an abyss
Perpetrators rest and piss in a ditch
Pit, falling forever whenever you fuck with the emperor's ship
They might sweet talk your face to a chocolate chip
Closed casket, I'm out this bitch

There shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water
Follow him into the house where he has enter you
I walk alone
I welcome you

Flirting with death seems like the biggest infidelity
Darker the skin on the ebony, in Liberty City the weaponry
Has taken out one of my niggas Tiara Grant was the name
Fo' shot up in the corridors, ended up slain
Up in the C9 live in this region, 
LSD in the cube
Multiply it to the third power, now it's changing my view
Black and white world stinks, that Pepé Le Pew
Should I ask God himself ""What's this opposite you?""
If Lucifer out there, are you after me too
And if I'm not allowed into heaven, would you rapture my crew? Snooze, catching Z's look forgot to cop a plea
But as far as god goes, I would say god is deceased
Wait, I would say god is in me
Jealously turns into murder cause some pride is vanity
Ego 'come Yeezy
 therefore insanity
Catch my thoughts into the seas let them swim with manatees
2055, mine is finally out the freezer
Welcome back as King Diamond
 with a new gat that's green
Fresh out the institution that arrived at the zone three
But I chose a different terminal in the eyes of the merciful
Who murder fools, who get trapped inside a maze
Now something is unusual, like Keanu Reeves cubicle
A Matrix, invasion until I'm rapping whole and take tricks
Forsaken with these lead bullets she laced with
Was taken from from existence left with Jason
The future I look upon with amazement
Is just a trick with a face lift, Pissing on these peons as a hate gift
I'm shroomed out

The matter is grey, not simply black or white
Left or right the true path is opaque and vicious ?
The future is embued with golden anticipation
Faith like time never moving in a straight line
The arc of destiny stretching out like a rainbow through the cosmos
40 years can pass by in the blink of an eye
Did I truly live life or simply ride the sands as they tumbled through the hour glass
Holding on the fine moments is like grasping water
Always there, yet always slipping away
Lusting for more than we need
Leading to the greed of acquisition
And the gluttony of position
A future that feels far but all too close
One that could be sublime if we didn't fall behind in the times from our refinement of the mind
The state of my people is altered but my faith is completely unfaltered

Outside, looking in
Reached me on a place you've never been
See, I have the power of many men
When I walk, you don't see a grin
It's my ignorance with intelligence
Militant move, you should never question the elephant
I appear, yet I'm barely even here
When you're not around, there’s no one that's allowed to see my tears
Adam to your Eve, apple of your eye
Whatever the circumstances, know I'll end up on your side
Carole, hit you with the lovestruck arrow
Feelings start to scat like Ella Fitzgerald
Pharaoh, honestly, I meant to say pheromone
You was always there since my parents was never home
Orphan, cracked fortune
Protecting my precious orchid from evil forces
Dormant, see the sky's not stormless
Monday is so heavy
Hit you back on a Tuesday, when things feel steady
Here's the prophet, the one and only who's laying there
Forever known as E, ain't no need for the alias
I'm representing Mars till I feel like an alien
And you're the only star that I'll date again, love

Days without your face
It's hard to stay sane alone
I hate the time you're not here
You're the closest thing to home",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-lonestar-jazz-lyrics

From medulla of the savage
Niggas sticking with the illest shit 
got more sticks than a cabin
Wet em up like Squarepants 'till the niggas start crabbin'
Rundown gun down like Birdman they clapping
BRRRTT!
What happened to that boy?
Niggas yapping then they pull a strap into that boy
Paramedics come stressing cause a nigga got wetted
Lurking low in the gardens watch his head get severed
I reign supreme, the world is mine and you can't do a thing
Cause you can't kill a God but a God can kill a king
Checkmate, fuck this shit you dead weight
You the type to make a jit heart race
Cut cable fuck niggas and what would that make you
The person in the mirror not looking so beautiful
Who is you nigga, mirror mirror in the bathroom
Am I gonna take a job to the back room
Later pimping down and hit em with that crack boom
Then I send her home and laugh like some old coons
By the store Life is fact the truth is cold
That's how you live 300 years more
Philosophy the prophecy is probably a robbery
Don't talk to me about, who's the motherfucking future
C9 bow down to your rulers

I got four niggas on the porch
Two niggas out the park
You better have your burner  tucked when walking after dark
Niggas be running reckless with their hammers ready to spark
Everybody is a target in the hood they playing darts
Taking them underwater
It's through the hood and past the wudz
Taking them underwater
So pass the wudz and roll them good
Taking them underwater
And drive my mess understood
Taking them underwater
I'll take you underwater

Okay this one’s for all my dogs
I do it for all of my niggas
For Lotto, Chinaman, and Tiarra pour out some liquor
Still thug livin'
Come witness the black vision, trigger finger itchin'
Brothers fall like thanksgiving, your heart is St. Nicholas
Merry Christmas 
American Psycho with Bale as the Christian
Bust your head like baby ? made of crimson
Where is he now I'm spitting genocide to niglets
Paraquiz back in the day, watch me form into bitches
Completes the masters, you bastards
Need to pass her, but the pastor, is an actor
If the rapture was to capture
Any mother fucker on this planet
I know that God’s an artist so he’ll pick a good canvas
So I let the bad ones perish
I found god inside the face that I’m starin', at
In my world Jesus is black and misunderstood
I’m taking y'all past to the wudz and say

There they go sticking again
There they go sticking again
There they go sticking again
There they go sticking again
So steal, steal, steal, steal
There they go sticking again
There they go sticking again

Grab the steer throw the keys get the mac
Cyberspace mask doing drive-bys in hovercrafts
Black hover craft
Grey matter gats counter act
What better way to use crack to terminate blacks
Black got jacked now that’s the school of Hard Rock
This ain’t no game you don’t live with a life stock
Like the Legend of Zelda it’s Heaven or Hell, bruh
You callin' for 911 but there’s no one to help ya
M16 feel like it's Hamburger Helper
And now you see yourself flying with Delta an airline
Tech 9 young and wave it ya tape line it’s C9

Them boys got toys and still I don't even got a deal
I think I'll get high

I like my currency lucrative, my words are provocative
I say what I say cause what I say is my prerogative
I stay positive as if I was terminally ill
I could imagine having a friend but that never was real
Lemonheads only using me for the limelight
Looking at my wrist, they reveal themselves when the time's right
When it's said and done, I can only see it in hindsight
Pull a Fetty Wap on these niggas and give a blind eye
I don't rock fake shit or fight soft niggas
I try to unite all my brothers cause I lost niggas
I got Nell and Slikk back so now I kick back
Only thing I pray for is Mookie to get his jit back

Got my nigga Boogie in the front, nigga what's up?
Hop out, do my motherfuckin' stuff, nigga what's up?

Lazy don't suit me nigga, see it when I start slackin'
I learned to see the bigger picture when they start flashing
Got it depicted to the pixel, you just all captions
Oh shit, I feel enriched from my misfortune
Just know that talkin' gotta chill if you bench-warming
Just know the groupie getting blocked before she ever get to score
No you just a rebound, I only hit you when I'm bored
You only wit' me for the come up

Drug dealers be switching to Santa Claus instead of a cane

Fuck them other niggas mane
They're not icy, and they don't ball

Blowing that Luke Skywalker kush, Reflex under my nigga I could

Damn, real nigga still will kill niggas have you lying still nigga
Nah, nah for real nigga, but went up your Hilfiger

It's the notorious spitter, kicking it with my niggas
From the Vill, tryna bill all my niggas can keep it real
My people sittin' in cells placing robbery with a steel
Jumping numbers on every bail just so they can get out to kill
They arresting Lee Hart Infield living the life of a cotton mill
Enlighten by Christ so I see the wrong in my right
Every night he gon' off the marijuana from Cali to Arizona
I get bad bitch, bonus she bitch I hit homers
Gotta take you by the edge no stitch and give donors (daily)

That ain't reality it's blocked the animality
That Denny possessed on the system on the exorcist anatomy
Radically rebellious to the fuckery and the faggotry, not as a caution that you cannot sugar me
Not by the doctor with boy with the Agassi that you got
I'm the antagonist to the plot of how America with three K's wanna see niggas got cake
That's the operation for the country separation
Segregate and divide and conquer they wanna see us dead, eh
Planet of the apes 'cause now niggas wearing Bape
Put a color in coordination that's why niggas hate on Dre
But he black too like a tattoo, report his color and
Trying to separate the kin from the mixture of the skin
Fuck a bitch B M Dub

Now it's us against the world new millennium niggas like us
Drop the late shit down but you prolly gone hear me just like believe me or not they'll look for you and Ripley (Why)
Why why

Fuck that though you don't gotta believe 'cause nigga like us all have weed
I got plenty shrooms when I walk in the room get any bitch here high off me
Tryna put the word through my penmanship
'Cause you don't get the shit 'cause your inferior
I'ma go slap on my interior boy
Tongue loud we ain't hearing ya boy
Trap the photo full who has been noticed me
Nigga in jail and I'm sending them photos
I hoping they know that I'm out here grinding for a muthafuckin reason
Clock niggas on the IPod season what is your meaningful dream
Better wake your punk ass up
Like Sway in the morning, I'm down and recording as early as hell
Quickly cops wanna throw me in jail, What the fuck? I just be coolin
You ain't dropped off shit let me school Ya
Don't let this rap shit fool Ya
I don't want beef, I illuminate until we see the gates and this God says that we face
As I kill the Sphinx with a rival verse C9 is like Steve Jobs birth

Stop breathing
Got whores on all fours and four seasons
No more for locked doors, we all greasin'
When you in a room full of gods, so pledge allegiance
Baby, open your cleavage, uh
On to Cleveland, I'm off to brown
And I might swerve my words, and I swerve my nouns
Renounced, when I used to smoke a ounce and bounce
Way back, way before I had a bank account
I had one, two, three, four
Five, six, seven, eight pennies in my pocket
Actin' like the hot shit
Knowin' damn well that a nigga ain't got shit
Strictly for my niggas, way before I'm on that 'Pac shit
That was way back, like, where my slaves at
Way before Ross even had a Maybach
The cars, the jewels, the hoes don't impress me
Flashin' lights, and looking like it's epilepsy
I ball like pistols when you wanna be a Piston
Fuck your wrist, I'd rather go and put my fist in
Put your fist pump rather than a fist bump
I get the ski mask and watch your gods get slumped
Ain't no false prophets, counterfeits and false profits
Came through and you know I be the hot topic
Curry is the nigga on the knowledge, I drop shit
Denzel and you know I came through, I pop shit
The uzis and moves in rooms like the Yakuza
Far from losers, more like penny abusers
Money young, money on my mind, I'm
Sunny, sunny, sunny, let me shine, rise
Risin' on the motherfuckin' east like the Islam
I don't really give a fuck, they lookin' like, ""Who is him?""
Nigga came through with the motherfuckin' ism
Like racism, or sexism, I texting 'em
That motherfuckin' knowledge I drop
Denzel, motherfucka, on the shit I pop
I skate like a motherfuckin' Figure 8
If a nigga wanna talk about a dinner date

See this is my property, yet the system don't give a damn
Take Mars, remove the S, spell it backwards, I'm a ram
This the jam
See, everything is hot on this desolate planet

No diagnostics, all your drawers need to see a mechanic
Damn, we can't manage—man, we can't vanish
I can't speak robot, but I can speak Spanish
Seems a lot of real music has been forever banished
Evangelists of the sonic revival, from trip-hop into tribal
Not a fight over music, this is my fight for survival
How many robots? How many rebels?
How many lighters? How many levels?
How many monkeys? How many barrels?
Left in peril, death isn't the only thing that scare you

When I swerve, coming down, when I swang through
Stadium starship be 
boomin' like Metro
Can I phone you home with my Bluetooth?
Gold on my grill and my Glock is gray matter
Some niggas be hollerin' 'bout truce, truce
Beam me from misery, Pegasus symphony
Riding black hoes in a black coupe
Denny Cascade
 the majestic Messiah
Pronounced as the funkiest Jesus
Stranded in Zone 3 my nigga
I'm zoning with LSD tabs in my grapefruit
Sighin' rewindin' about the last time
That my nine would cock back and would chase you
Think of my honey, I'm buzzing, I'm bugging
About the last time I would taste you, hate to",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-stadium-starship-lyrics

Well these niggas, I'mma tell 'em how it is my nigga
Comin' from my mouth, Strictly For My Raiders

This song goes out to the motherfucking cops and to the po-po lice
Wanna see you pop a nigga
Wanna see you kill a nigga, no justice, no peace
Little niggas wanna grab that gauge
Around that motherfucking Blackland
CC where I be, motherfuckers 'round here
Wanna kill a black man

Niggas wanna talk that shit
Always sayin' you a gangsta, but real niggas know you a bitch
Had a couple homies that hit a couple licks
That what you expect when you never had shit
Growin' up in the mothafuckin' slums
With a fuckin' gun to yo mothafuckin' gums
And pop a nigga in his mothafuckin' lungs
Two shots and you dead, yo' little ass is done
Increase with the skill, right now it’s fuck how you feel
The way I get to it, you get chills
Niggas they claimin' they trill
All because they rockin' a slug and they grill
Quit faking the phonk
Immortal words, from my nigga Key
Bitch, I could rock a pink shirt
Polka dot hat and still do me
Real nigga to the letter
Goddesses they gettin' wetter
When niggas get outta line with the real
The semi just might bless ya
But coppers wanna take your life
More than you wanna take mine
Lets start a revolution
Everybody grab a nine
Bitch

This is for America
Bout to put this shit in check
See me with my hoodie on
Just know these crackers wanna grab that TEC
Cause they feel a threat
Cock that beam and aim it at your chest
No I'm not wearin' a vest
Don't really care, cause this life is a test
My soul relieved
Nigga not trippin' I won't spaz
Remember Trayvon Martin
Then I blast on Zimmerman's ass
Its amazing how
They'll lock me up for petty shit
Though I cannot live this life
Like this, but I keep takin' it
Darker the flesh, the tighter the noose
They callin' us coon and they callin' em' goose
Look at my flesh, dig deep in the roots
The shit that I speak is the ? of the truth
Nowadays
All these mothafuckas hittin' shipe
Yes, I was born in this world
But since I'm black I'm born with a strike

Am I scared of dying, more of a bullet flying
Enter my window and hittin' my kinfolk, sit back with a blunt and I’m sighing, bored
I hear niggas knocking at the door
Talking about some crucial shit like Cascade
This shit is war round these parts
This shit is on your porch or even at the park
Shooting your bloods and your nigs out the dark
Then they jump out and get caught by a narc
13 round from the sound of the chopper
Guaranteed dropper
Go on and let the hammer bang
Like Bob the Builder they fix it and rang
AK-47, 30 second to 47, fill it up with Mac-11s

Have, gold bullets rocking inside your temple, Metallica
What happens when murder and mix 'em with Galaga
That's too many niggas that's calibrating with calibers
Excalibur, killin' all through the book of lies
Livin' upon a revelation, but as master in disguise
I'm master in disguise, elevated you and I
Counting sticks and body parts, options when is join or die
Count to 2, grab the 9, all these suckers are clouds
'Cause their fantasy is final destination underground
To a dirt freak accident, A young Devil's advocate
Goin' Ham on the Madison, and poppin' his bitch from the cabinet
I keep locally Madison, before an undergraduate
Jobs closin', now you coppin' that brick from the ocean
All your life you have been focused since your mom wasn't open
Face shine inside a box now it looks like you votin'

From where the slogan was survive in Atlanta that holds the zone of war
More killers bribe with contraband, but they playin' Contra, fuck around
Tryin' to meet the next level and minimize the coppers
The CPU and cheat codes won't work
20 years old can't afford a lawyer, momma said he should've went to church
Stop by, I'm smokin' in another universe
As my whole planet gets worse, I'm blasted if I could rule the world
On my way back to Earth
And see all of the out of the day gloomers
Inter-galactic storm troopers keepin' my brothers captive
So don't ask me if I believe in magic
If I answer, I say it only exists in drugs
And god is a mirror 'cause his image is in us
Holy water drippin' down her body hurry up get a cup
Down a  in panties hopin' that she wasn't naked
Same outfit as Eve, I'm not Adam, but I'm still sacred

He slit the adam's apple and now it's forsaken
The  basic, all medication, civilization is pagan
Before we built the pyramids, hieroglyphics outdated
Textin' on the iPhone and 95 works slated
Israelites in a modern-day Babylon
 but cannot live in the sun
Before explain to me how we not the chosen one
7 stars in my hand, and a blade on my tongue
Whether a god is a profit, illusion optic
Clocks stop it, had to pause it, fundamental brain deposit
 project, 'cause science is not a conscience
Put in logic, no emotional  shit
Holy as the cross that Jesus walked in, to the Crossroads
I don't see no Bonethugs, all I see is Thugbones
Stone cold the pegasus is arson
Radiate flows like sippin' water out the faucet, bitch

Custom plated and put it in a scribe
If we start a revolution, it needs to be televised
But it will be only for the viewers that's watchin' with open eyes
I despise you critics that interfere with your lies
I'm on an acid tab havin' intercourse with the sky, fuck the world

2055 BET HIP HOP AWARDS C9 CYPHER,UnKnown,2014.0,"Got me feeling like a fucking dog, it's outside
 house and bars, Aquarius Killer Curry is a fuckin' god
Backwards nigga no facade, I'm from a place where niggas switchin' squad
Z3, Z4 and all across the block
Niggas out here blame flags
Purple, green or that all-black
Fuck around you get your ass taxed
Stick in the field you get wet
Like arcane and that mole rat
From Chuck E. Cheese, nigga let's take it back
Caught flaggin' by the stove
Nigga hopped out the four-door
You know Mo thinks in slo-mo, like Trinity
You cross me like a trinity
Nevertheless it's meant for me
Extend my hatred wickedly one-hundred times infinity
Super Saiyan level hit the boiler point
Hotter than the  with the Devil in the back of a joint
First one to die is the one who's the hardest
Blackland Carol City, bitch welcome to Muder Gardens

Feel like I got the power, I'm higher the hip hop Messiah
I ain't fuck Alicia Keys but a nigga on fire
That's prior to the fact that I'm rawer then unprotected sex
Eat some Chex cereal in the morning and then it's off for checks
And why niggas asking me to match spliffs
I'd rather stay home, break backs like Mike Smith
I'll write a cool mixtape drop it on Dat Piff
Now these hoes tryna use me I'm feeling a little thrift
Damn Josh you rap now, but I ain't talking about gifts
And I ain't talking about cliffs when I say I leave you hanging
'Cause you bitches got the blues like a smurfet if you banging
And I ain't banging I'm just banging these hoes niggas claim they taming
I'm always rappin burning up like coal, aiming at you hoes
Women that don't have no fucking souls their hearts a fucking cold
Mines is bared ass on a igloo
So don't ask me do I care about these bitches and what they
All do 'cause uhm
They probably what I'm getting through
Rapping fucking hoes it helps me with what I'm getting through
Getting super wet and lay the pipe like a plumber do
The name getting known so these bitches sticking like some
Glue, I'ma ball cause a nigga shine more than a car being waxed
Bought some armorall hoho, get off my santa clause
Class writing rhymes cause I don't have time for this work shit
Probably high as fuck I'm  weed I'm talking purp shit
Teacher passing out D's so yes I'm barely passing
But I'm worried about the fashion and the bitches in which
I'm smashing
Bust a nut and drop her off and then I dump her like some ashes
Like sorry Mr. Johnson, for this math I have no passion
I'd rather make sweet love to the girl that sitting next to me
And flip her like a supreme deluxe Krabby Patty recipe
They like damn Josh how come you haven't blown yet
Because I haven't kissed enough ass to get known yet, dummy

Niggas swear they get pussy but having phone sex
Tell her give me head 'til her forehead dome sweat
Meat cleaver flow for niggas thinking they raw
Leave you looking like DMX if you keep barking at the dogs
Check her call log, I bet you nigga I ain't call at all
To me it's 100 miss calls check her crib you'll probably find my
Drawers, and one of my balls
Why niggas always stall, I'm that nigga on call with three bitches, ho I'm Jabber Jaws
And with the pussy cat doll, check my catalog dog
My catastrophic bombs will probably throw you off
Niggas always coming soft, so I had to flip the script
I think I'm Da Vinci hiding images inside the script
Watching tales from the crip, lay my spread and then I dip
Say she want to take a trip well here's yo shroom take it
Have her seeing hyenas and shit, like a safari
I'm on Safari you should Google me bitch
Before I put this Google Chrome and show yo' ass some digital shit
I say it straight to yo face, no subliminal bitch
I slide through like I'm gumby
It's like Return of the Mummy, shit'll get ugly
Cause niggas in the field, no rugby
Bitches want to fuck me, tell her that she lucky if I touch thee cunty
I was probably riding out on my huffy, one deep
Riding through these streets like I ain't me, I'm a wolf
Nigga and you looking like a black sheep
You would make a nice shirt, but it's too hot for the long sleeve
You looking cotton soft, I feed you to my offspring, fuck you

What the fuck you need bitch
Never sold a copy I sell rocksies and I clean shit
Cleaner than crispy, sort of like Whitney you O.D. bitch
Inhaling and smoking on shit that's so potent it's making me see shit
She's praising my cum like it's Jesus
I stay with the green, its too filthy for the OZ of it
A forest of trees, smoke so thick I can not breathe in it
Who's working like me bitch? I'm taking your millis' like Regis did
When you answer ""B"" but, playing these games will not give you shit
And neither will we, but the drugs set you up with a gun to your lips
I'm high as can be so, I do not really give a shit like toilet for pee
Just like Humsy and Bill which I say with a brick, so fuck the police
Sort of like bops on the cops they can suck my dick, not literally
Hoe said I'm cliche so I spray on her tits
She ice and she gliss, she's covered in jizz
Killing these bitches like serial disses
I leave them exquisitely killed in the trenches
Like water they wet
And my pistol is best cause it lock on like jaw when I sent to the head and I kill
You want some pills, I got tanks I got bells
Yes I know I'm killing you, but I have to pay the bills
Hoe I got sticks like a fucking stick drill
Up in the lot like I'm  crack, all I know is how to kill
Decipher your head leave you split like her legs, or the motherfucking seal
Cut these faggots up like some fucking fish scale
Colored beam pointed at the demons where they dwell
Kill a faggot cop, send his ass back to hell",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-2055-bet-hip-hop-awards-c9-cypher-lyrics

Click, clack, pow, ? the sound, you better get down, nigga
Give me my crown, I'm the best in the booth
K be a trip, nothing less than the truth
Stay in my vibe, get high on herbal
Geeked like Urkel, but bad like Kirko

Little jits getting got, the block too hot

On two knees, praying up top
Hoping that the bullshit stop
But no time soon, so I carry the boomer to boom
I'm telling you fucks that I won't lose, K-Trip, nigga

Suicidal bombers on that DMT
So I'm killing 'em, trying to become a legend like I'm William
Killing 'em softly, searching for a refuge

What happened to that bunny on Tyler? So the dick was fatter?

A tedious technicality but we are men of honor
Don't you worry though, we'll get your prize yet
As long as my body continues to shrink at this pace I'll no doubt be dead within the span of a year
Voice 2: Right, the low human diet's working wonders for you
Voice 1: As for the matter of my throne, you'll have to get much stronger to fend off my enemies

Alone as I howl to the moon in the dark
Raised by the wolves since the very fuckin' start
Twisting my ratchet I'm clickin' and klackin'
Chop off your head and get placed in the basket

Put them paws on your ass like Simba did Doa

Say my name twice and you cursed like Macbeth
Call it spirit gun when I'm lifting your soul
Only fear of god when everyday I grow old

A life in the day as
Denzel Curry

Okay, it's five in the morning
Crack of the dawn and I'm yawning
As I just reminisce when me and my cousin used to roll a swish
Pussy ass niggas they act like a bitch
They say I wasn't gon' be shit
Cause the words I choose to use was just so damn articulate
I paint a picture
With the scripture my father gave me
Went to yelling niggas and bitches and how you wouldn't play me, but
After my granny passed that's when a nigga grew heartless
Run up in the nigga house and shoot the shit like target
Get it, with a pen and a pad and I was quick with it
Laying down on the back end so me and my niggas could rip it
But by then, we broke up
Reality hit and I woke up
Each and every day I take a smoke and I would choke up
Now it's over
I keep a conscious mind ever since I went sober
Stopped speaking of happy times, I wasn't in Range Rovers
A few months later I had a chat with Dece
Yeah Mike Dece, a real Posh OG
Talking about this rapper that came out the CC
Carol City's own folk, yeah I'm from the Zone 3
Simmie, well Andrew
Straight out of Myrtle Grove
Came a fan to a friend, Raider Klan across the globe
People raising eyebrows
Think my songs is devilish
Know it's quite rebellish
Plus my talent's heaven sent, ferno
Creeping with the flame so they can burn dro
Or probably in the Jaguar, bumping while they ride slow
Now listen
No need for the hating niggas
Wasn't here before but then arrived so you a fake nigga
Now my Facebook and Twitter's full of compliments
They scream Aquarius Killer, now triumphant, then accomplishments
That's as far as I got on my verse

In my premonition, I only picture my infants
Rugrats, skip all the talk about Dr. Lipschitz
Tryna keep the balance, be honorable and sadistic
Lost a lot of homies, but in my dreams they revisit
Lookin' at the world without lookin' forward to Christmas
Should I be a Buddhist, Jehovah's Witness or Christian?
Satan's out the question
With the way the industry ran, you gotta have a fuckin' death wish
Just to get views or to be viewed as a legend
But call a nigga corny when you hear he got a message
Damn, I know a nigga preachin' like a reverend
My head is out the box like Seven
Call me Pandora, martial arts elevate my aura
Fire spit make you sound poorer
There is no order, I am number one, fuck a top five
Yeah, them other niggas cool, but brodie, they are not live
For the fact, them other niggas are not I
Too fly, compare me to Marty McFly
No Biggie, I'm rappin' like I'm from Bed-Stuy
Bustin' off the top of the dome, my mind is war cry
Truthfully the realest of all and that is no lie
Put me on the track with the best and they'll be no tie

Fightin' demons in holy water to cover my steps
Walk through the fire, I'd rather die than to give my respect
Well protected, a deadly weapon that can't be concealed
On that hunt just like a lion, but I walk through the field
While they was hatin', oh, I was makin' my way up the hill
Huh, and they coulda all followed
Belly of the beast, you always headed to the bottom
It's an unseen problem, got the underscene poppin'
I'm a real show stopper, real proper, real Don Dada
You could call me daddy, just know I will not father
And I will not sponsor anything I make
And anything, I need a hot dollar, I don't need a dumb model
Need a hot scholar, like I'm Van Wilder
Cause anything I do, I'm known to take that shit skyward
Uh, now it's time get up like I was too excited
Successes in my horizon
I'm headed towards where they light is, nobody real can deny this
You gon' miss this plane like we're sayin'
And I still be givin' out game, I'm just sayin'

And I don't like Pixar, mister
I am the master, I came through like a (
Wait a minute
), bastard
Nobody fathered my style
People said I would fall off, but I've been here for a while, so nope
Are you ready for the motherfuckin' giant?
The tyrant, the titan, the ogre, the lycan
The vampire, taking over empires
If the game was a tooth, I'm a fuckin' pair of pliers
We gon' do 'em Vinny style
As you can see, this nigga got many styles (
Serious
)
Know too many niggas that got semi rounds (
Serious
)
They're cold like ice
Put thorns to your crowns, you go out like Christ, my niggas

Get money from a show, then deposit it (
Uh
)
Your show ain't got no hoes, I acknowledge it (
Yeah
)
So braggadocios, spit sick shit, it's atrocious (
Nasty
)
Risin' like the stocks, stockbroking
The Shogun, came through with no gun
One man, Ichiban, fresh out of Japan, do as I command
And what I demand is some fuckin' peace and quiet
Told 'em please go to church, and please get on a diet

You motherfuckers know what time it is
It's the motherfuckin' championship",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-diet-a-colors-show-lyrics
32 Ave (Intro) [Remastered],32 Zel,2017.0,"Up on the Three Two Ave
I wake up every morning tryna figure how to start my day (my day)
I go to the bathroom then take me a piss
Brush my teeth now it's time to parlé (I'm out)
I call up B Money to open the crystal
It's time to go jet so I skate (open the door, nigga)
I'm rolling and blousing and coughing these ounces
These money roll a whole 28
Took 8 grams
Bumping 99' jams reminiscing on the town last week
Talk about a cop cherry tops run a block
In a Baja saying the youngin' had heat
Spur of the moment
The youngin' was dumb as he dropped from a fatal attack
On the 207 called 9-11
Hit 15 bullets to his back
Shit got whack
Everybody really on that but you just got to embrace it
Even on the tracks just like it's braces
Murder Gardens, Carol City unsolved cases
Face it, you get wasted like it's GTA
But this ain't no Grove Street and you ain't CJ, nigga

BLACK BALLOONS | 13LACK 13ALLOONZ (Like A Version),UnKnown,2019.0,"Hi, my name is Denzel Curry
And you're now 'bout to witness ""Black Balloons""
And a one, two
One, two, three, let's go

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head (And what we do?)
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to a thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop, let's go

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head (And what we do?)
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me (One time)
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head (And what we do?)
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float (Ladies and gentlemen)
Let it float, let it float (Sampa)
Let it float, let it float by me

Assume life is  I'm the liberator
Assume the walls are closing in, but that's the indicator
I die a love or hater, I love a lot of haters
Who wear a mask and take a jab and  see me later, uh
Nah, ask not what we can do
Accounting for the energy residing in my mental
Oh, a who are you, you haven't thought it through
You standing on the seat and let is sway, you are suspendable
Honey, you too dependable
I don't mean to offend you boo
If your boo don't inspire independence
Now I can't be shy, I'm undecided
I feel my fears, I die, duh-dun dead
We fly balloons so high we rise in
Now me and gravity are like friends to the end, ah

Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head (And what we do?)
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me (Two times)
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head (And what we do?)
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

And on keys, we got Michael Beck playing
And on bass, we got Joe Birdman
And on the drums, we got Jamie Cameron
And on the guitar, we got Art, check it out
And on the right, we got Sampa The Great
And on the mic, you got Danny Cascade
And on the mic, everybody in this hit
Let's break it down
Let it float, let it float, let it float, now
Let it float, let it float, let it float, now
Let it float, let it float, let it float, now
Let it float, now, let it float, now
Let it float, let it float, let it float, now
Let it float, let it float, let it float, now
Let it float, let it float, let it float, now
Let it float, now, let it float, now, now, now, now

Buildin' a feelin' is live is evil
And evil is killin' shit
Killin' these tracks

Don't sleep little niggas
Just know where I'm from that's the mothafuckin' death
That's havoc
My prodigies gon' ride with me
We Mobb Deep
Talkin' gangsta shit
So call gangsta cliques
Don't get ya head bust on the concrete

Blast a mothafucka outta his concourse wit Anna
So Curry smash yo bitch just like Bruce Banner
I'm Thor inside the punani
With that shit I'm goin' hammer

Pullin up chest and they chasin my niggas, they tell 'em give way
Look at the way that brother Lynch
Look at my brothers, we be with the shit
So back up
Before Mr.Curry Denzel, that nigga might act up
Mystical, spiritual, lyrical criminal
Kill 'em like killer
That nigga be cynical
Write it down and watch you die
Then I'll let yo soul fry
Dante Inferno
Burn it eternal
Damn nation
What the fuck I'm laced with
Bitch, you got a Death Wish?
Then I will be like Jason
Ask them niggas ride yo
Then let a motherfucker die slow

So niggas better be ready
Chop up the shit when I cut up yo bitch
I'm ganging up niggas with machetes
So bow nigga!

I'ma sever it when I sever shit

Know when it rains, it pours
They wanna go to war
For things that they can't afford
I gotta grab the sword, preach
I gotta thank the Lord, I gotta go record (heat)
I wanna be fly to soar 'cause niggas be trying to floor me
People be thinkin' that I won the lottery
So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me
Out of nowhere try to fight you
I'm feeling like Raichu 'cause everything shocking to me
Gotta beware of the wicked, the time will be ticking
Them niggas still clocking on me
Lord is my witness, I handle my business
You niggas ain't never ball blocking on me

I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help
I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man, it's been so damn long, dealing with the things I've felt

I been peepin', searching for a pussy nigga photo, woo
Give me all of that or you ain't coming back nor baby boo
I just need it - I’m anemic and I know it’s critical
And I’m sorry if I up the stick and have to click on you
I ain't going back to jail, nigga, fuck the feds
If I gotta kill a nigga, gotta cut the dreads
Put him in his spot, nigga, run the bread
Before I nut up put a gun to your head
Z3 yeah Z4, frankly I don’t know
Posted sellin' green so not no mo’, cause a nigga is tired of being broke
And I’m tired of living at my folks
My old girl need some help
And my girlfriend bout to have a jit
Plus I don’t want him growing up saying daddy never had shit
Daddy never had it, but based on analysis
I never seen challenges, I look at his Roley I know that he flashin' it
I wouldn't mind seeing blood just like I got off dialysis Lord of the dark and violent
Only know imperial niggas move in silence, look that old boy yeah you shining
Steve got gold, and his girl got diamonds
Hopping in the whip, two niggas riding
We all gon die nigga fuck reclining, we all got 5 let's get behind em
Let's go get em

Who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero
I said who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero

I been seeing, watching cause these niggas got it in for me
Flexing flashy wrists is correlating with my golden teeth
Diamonds all around a neck and it came with a diamond ring
I done seen all kind of shit, what niggas do over finer things
That’s why I carry the 9 on me that’s a three times three extendo, that’s a 10-4
Seen them niggas on the 191, but a nigga peep game on the 194
Woah, bending corners just to see if they followed us
Sweating bullets, heater under my cardigan
These type of niggas is known to be poppin' shit
Deep in my thoughts, know who the prophet is
Tryna to take my wealth, gotta protect my wifey and my jit
Gotta set an example if you thinkin' I'm a walking lick
Never believed in lawlessness, but I could be with the shits
When I’m nervous it's dangerous, if the police pull up, then I tell em I’m innocent
They tried to run down on us, swore that the clip I might empty it
Lords of the dark and violent, just ended up on the pavement, quiet
This is the reason why niggas divided, pray to the lord I don’t get indicted
Send me all the way to Rikers Island, dead on the ground now he’s a carcass
That’s our guy, that’s our target
Let’s go get em

Who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo
Two 44s at your head, don’t be a hero
I said who’s that peeking in my window?
Baby, please pass the extendo
Hey yo, they tryna take my cheese and my steelo

Snapping niggas' necks, Macho Man, Randy Savage
All my hoes the baddest, Hold 'em like magnets
If I see George then my man, I'll blast him
They look like we ain't equal
Turnin' us against our own people
No , pure evil
Not transparent, I see you
Tell the truth and they ain't believe you
Only live once, you better think twice (think about it)
 they'll come and snatch your life
This chess, not checkers, not rolling dice",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-champs-n-gs-lyrics

Got the game on the motherfuckin lockdown
Couple hoes on the motherfuckin cock now
See a nigga like me got a real 6D, bitch better have that lockjaw
Got bars like I'm fresh out the cop car
Too bad I ain't be in the cop car
You a snitch, you hop out the cop car
So I leave your body outside the cop car
Run in the closet, run at your couch
My plan is takin you out
Don't fuck with me, you know what I'm bout
I already told you, I'm lookin for guap
Mark got the picture, niggas get cropped",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-nigga-like-me-lyrics
Denzel Curry Sway In The Morning Freestyle,UnKnown,2020.0,"Everybody wants me to rap
Matter fact, everybody wants me to-
Poetry, flowetry
Everybody say yes
Curry is the best, the ichiban
Came through, motherfuckin' taliban
Blowin' up, pakistan, thinkin' 'bout is armageddon
I came through with a lethal weapon like I'm Danny
Glover, came through, I am not your lover
Motherfucker I will fuck her then I might just use a rubber
It's the nigga undercover like I'm brother, like I'm Eddie
Griffin, nigga came through with the smithin'
Wessin', who the fuck you testin'
Blessin' these motherfuckin' niggas like a pastor
The master, came through I blast ya
Leave you on the wall like plaster
Casper, all you niggas ghost
Everybody know that Curry kill a nigga's not a hoax
I'm a legend, I came through and you know I'm stepping
On this block, in these 305 shoes
Everybody know that, nigga, get a fucking Blue's Clue
'Cause I'm leaving niggas red
The niggas coming through and I'm going off top the head
And everybody know I just might just leave 'em dead
Put 'em in the grave when I cradle 
And niggas like to spin it like 
I don't give a fuck",https://genius.com/Denzel-curry-denzel-curry-sway-in-the-morning-freestyle-lyrics
Tsukuyomi Abyss,Melt My Eyes*,2019,"Lyrics from snippet
Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, the abyss
Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, I'm that rich
When I be talkin' to my people like this, raise my fist
I tell Trump in the office to suck a dick, bitch, I'm pissed
Reportin' live from the depths of the abyss, the abyss, the abyss

No, we don't take kindly to threats

Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick then I pull out the ski
Put a-put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That's what a nigga get being P.I.E
Swee-sweet, nigga you D.I.E
Sleep, motherfucker that's six feet
Deep, no tender, no love, no care
But a nigga here still gon' creep
T.L.C. put it to ya Lisa Lo' that's a nigga left
Eye, kill a nigga, ghost-ghost, that
Patrick Swayze, come equipped with a vest
I'mma point that shit to your motherfucking neck
K's all in my trunk
So you best to get chop-chopper
It's nothing but goon action
I ain't talking Wak-Flock-Flocka
That 2.7.5. goons
Bout' to do a fucking Gank
2-2-2 right up-right up- to a fucking game-game
Bumping-bumping  Waka Flocka Flame
In a underwater tank
Cause nigga die right now
Bullet or a fucking shank
Ni-niggas always tryna' be the hardest in the fucking game

Never take kind to the threats
I be off for your neck 'for you reach for the TEC, Simmie
Niggas gon' hear me then fear me, feel me?
Whole bunch of green in my Philly, turn up
Whole bunch of niggas if you run up
Tryna' act hard with your gun up, I shoot your son up
Grinding till the sun up, middle finger flashed
That's a one up, I'm a young gutta
Dog I mutter, Curry said cut ‘em with his brudda
Leave them boys wet like water
Off with his neck, posted set-set
I don't take kindly to threats, take kindly to threats, ki-kindly to threats
Ratchet for life, I'm hood, tryna' smoke bad but I’m good
Bust a-bust a nigga head for the cake
Jumping over gates can't wait
Nine to the face, fuck nigga you ain't safe

Savage life nigga
You don't wanna see me live
Pop more than a quarter, so tell that dime piece
""Bitch, don't kill my vibe"", man
I know your bitch love me
I know your bitch want me
She let me pillow pet that kitty
When she climb under this Snuggie
Bitch, South Florida
I only smoke mid in Broward
But end the flame of that Magic Dragon
And kill that Charmander, bitch
Gone on you niggas
Two phones on you niggas
Think I made it?
You don't wanna see me ball on you niggas, bitch

Klan be the set, we don't take kindly to threats
