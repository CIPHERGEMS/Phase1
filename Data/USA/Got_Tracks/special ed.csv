I Got It Made,Youngest in Charge,1989.0,"I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speaking so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessing
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young
--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothing for security
I get paid when my record is played
To put it short, I got it made

I'm outspoken: my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cause coolin' is all that I'm about
Just foolin' with the girlies, yes I'm busting it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cause I'm the boss
I never will cause I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until I choose
Which I won't cause I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're invitin' me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect
 cause I-- got it made

I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut
 and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got 20, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kind of fond of Honda scooters--got 74
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta 
frog
--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti cause I own a percent
Got gear I wear for everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I've made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made

I'm kinda spoiled 'cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted leg--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growing too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
When the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me, I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader, if what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cause my waiter made potato 'n' alligator souflee--
I got it made",https://genius.com/Special-ed-i-got-it-made-lyrics
Lyrics,Revelations,1995,"Chorus 2X: ""Lyrics somebody want lyrics (yea yea)
Somebody want lyrics"" -- KRS-One
Verse One:
Here I go the lyrical specialist with the perscription
I give you the legal drug addiction, non-fiction
I got the shank, to your memory bank
How sharp, don't be afraid of the dark
Go in to the light, you still can't see
It can't be, the historical, metaphorical, oracle
Yes the S, you know the rest, fuck the spellin'
I'm tired of tellin' y'all who rule, cause you don't listen, fool
Your dealin' with a nigga feelin' fury
Surely, I purley destroy any toy with any game
That's why I never lose, I never play, I sever they style
While I maintain mine
Same time  yet, differ-rent, mag-nificent
No quest unless it's the Tribe
So check that vibe twice
Cause I'm nice
Whoever got beef
Tell me the price
And I'll raise you a mill, days to a kill, some praise to a bill
Never, yet I'm as lyrical as ever
Chorus
Verse Two:
You wanna start about, have you thought about
Consequences, sentences, come to your senses, or defenses
Cause I'm strictly throwin' hits
Knowin' it's, unfair
Gun here, take an extra clip
Cause I'm next to flip
Next time, bring in a next rhyme, cause I
Float like dead body, sting like a tazer
Sharper than a ... lazer
Open heart ... major
Surgery transplant cause you have none
Heres one, I dare Son, shoot a fair one, that's a real one
Grannit, you're now implanted with a enough heart to start
But can you manage when I damage your bandage
And your stitch is open
And your bitch is open
Is she, somethins' fishy
I don't like dis
When I'm like dis they try to 
ammulate
 my likeness
Clones
Microphones break from my intake
Faar phatter, mass matter, glass shatter
Be careful, I got an earful
Listen, I got them lyrics that your missin'
Chorus 3X
Verse Three:
You're commin' with your new sound
You never threw dowm
Why try? Try Muay Thai, hang em' high, in the closet
Cause it, wasn't, a good idea
Who should I fear
No one, the son of Jah
Gimmie some lah, and I get mystic
Lyrics dis thick, got weight
Your not great, your not good
I shot wood, put you out your misery history in the makin'
Fuckin' with a crazy Jamacain
See, they vanish when I brandish the hair trigga
Yea nigga
I'm goin hay wire
Might fire
Might not
But it's white hot
And with the right flow, the shit might blow
So I detonate, then evacuate, leavin' ash, don't even ask
Feel the blast, fast, I know you won't last
But you can still try
Somebody want lyrics
Then come see the eye

I’m the Magnificent,Youngest in Charge,1989,"I am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
Cause I'm the 
man of steel
 on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse
I'm just conversin' with you, person
This is just a conversation
I'm Special Ed, with the special presentation, hey
I like to play, so for me it's recreation
It's not just a job, it's an adventure
If worse comes to worse, I've got your thirst quencher
But ya gotta buy it, dont' even try it
I don't rhyme for free, no matter how dry it gets
I collect my money in sets
One before the show and again when I jet
So I get mine, and I'm a get more
Cause I'm financially secure and I'm sure
So I don't need your tips or advice
Cause I'm too nice for that, you rat
I can't stand mice, I'm like a cat, kinda frisky
Battling is risky business
You might acquire dizziness, just like whisky
Isn't this enough?
Oh, you think you're tough, cookie
I think you better call your bookie
Cause you can bet your life, I'm gonna play you like hooky
On a Friday, this is my day
When I was through, I heard you say, ""Why they dis me like that?""
I shoulda repent
Somebody shoulda said that Special Ed was the magnificent
I am the magnificent
I'm the magnificent, dynamite, super dope, outta sight
Special Ed with my trusty pal
Action Love, the run we shall
Continue to win, yet this is not a game
But I'm 'a play you if say you claim to be better
I hate rumors and I give tumors
And eye jammies get Grammys
Yet I'm not an actor
, it's just a factor that we're famous
Don't blame us for nothin'
Action Love is cuttin', I'm on the rhyme
Skin your teeth and it's your beef that I'll grind
Like a butcher, I'll put you on a table
And let my D.J. cut ya
But you're such a little sucker
I might not even touch ya
I betcha whatcha want is just attention
Your mother and your father shoulda used some prevention
Look at all the time and the money they spent
And now ya wanna die against I-the magnificent?
I am the magnificent!
I'm the magnificent with the sensational style
And I can go on and on for like a mile, a minute
I get in it like a car and drive
And if the record is smash, I can still survive
Cause I'm the man of steel on the wheel that you're steerin'
Or rather playin' on the record that you're hearin'
You might not understand what I'm saying at first
So Action Love, put it in reverse",https://genius.com/Special-ed-im-the-magnificent-lyrics
Think About It,Youngest in Charge,1989," - Rakim

Sometime I wanna rhyme, but then again I must wait
For the approaching of a toy to introduce him to his fate
Death, I always try to figure out why
Sucker MC's wanna battle me when they know they will die
In the end, so why pretend you're livin trifle
I'ma rope you up like a cowboy, stifle
Your throat with my microphone cord, cause I'm the lord
Of the rhyme, some people say that they can never get bored
Cause I'm exciting, pleasurable listening
I'm only tryin to show you what your records keep on missing, and
I'm only tryin to help our your crew, and
I know I must forgive ya, cause you don't know what you're doin
So sucker MC's, please think twice
Would you join the navy if you didn't like the gravy and rice?
Think about it
(Think about it)

Think about that, then think about this
If I tried to hit you, do you think that I would miss?
Well, I'm fast, I only hit the center, mass and head
I'm Special Ed, funkadelic relic of the ages
If you like this, then I got pages and pages
Some dumb bubbleyum bubblegum chewin
Chumps be screwin
I the fly, I wonder why
What's the reason for the treason, huh, you wanna die?
I'm high-post, higher than most
Not from France, but I eat french toast
I'm international, I make the cash in all ways
Got dollars in my pocket, cause man, it pays
To be smart, I turn my art into an empire
Cause I grow and grow, so you know I never tire
Got the status and the clout, no doubt
Of all time, I got the rhyme to take you out
Cause my rap is like a trap that you fall into
I'm Special Ed, now who the hell are you?
You're unknown, don't even own a microphone
You can't rap, you make me wanna cap a stone
In your eye, why do you persist to make noise
When ever since I was a kid I never did like toys
I get furious, leavin MC's curious
In a daze, my hits do faze
I recommend you listen to the phrase that pays
Don't jest, you won't succeed
I make you bleed till you need a transfusion
This is no illusion
I know you're gettin blurried, don't worry, it's confusion
Of the mind, don't whine, you can't cry forever
It'll take your life to decipher the clever
Rhymes that I say in the way that I do
Akshun Luv, my deejay, I guess it's on you
But is there anybody better? I doubt it
And if you think you are, I think you better think about it
(Think about it)

The lyrics are suffice, suffice are my lyrics
Idolized by the public, praised by the critics
Worth more than gold, longer than a giraffe
Take em to the pawn shop, get a yard and a half
And I'm the creator of the rhymes you praise
All of y'all with the gall I will leave in a daze
Try to battle me, and I'ma make it my job
To burn you as I turn you like a shishkebab
Cause yo, the style that I portrait is the style of a leader
If you' re really gonna battle me, you're really gonna need a
Whole crew, not two, three or four
You gonna need a whole posse, a mossie or more
Cause I'm strong, rap long, yet the rhymes don't drag
Like a bag full of tricks or a trick in a bag
I'm uprising, surprising
Not a nag, not antagonizing
Cause I'm full of fun, and I got a gun
To kill MC's fresher than me, but there are none
Cause I've looked everywhere
Under every rock, in every chair
MC's they try to hide when I get hot
I know that they hide, but where I know not
You're nothin but a sucker, chump you're scared
You tried to battle me, but you wasn't prepared
You slept, I crept up, shot your drawers
And now you're runnin for your life like you're swimmin from Jaws
But go, I know that you've learned your lesson
Go to church, just confess, and
Tell the preacher you committed sin
You battled Special Ed when you couldn't win
Tried, you cried, you shouted, you pouted
But I told ya - you should thought about it

The Mission,Legal,1990,"(We're on a mission) --] Salt-n-Pepa

This is a mission, not a small time thing
Let me tell you 'bout what happened when the phone went ( *ring* )
Well, I was coolin at the crib with this girl Suzanne
And everything was goin just accordin to plan
When the phone rang - yo, I couldn't believe it
Told myself to ignore it, forget it, leave it
Just when things had started goin great
It rang again I said, ""Hold up, wait""
Picked up the phone, yelled, ""Who the hell is this?""
Somebody said, ""This is serious business
There's a tape in the mailbox between your doors
Take the tape from the box, and put it in yours""
I listened to the tape and my mouth just dropped
I picked up the phone, but the man hung up
It said, yo, 'this tape will self-destruct'
I pressed the deck, but the tape was stuck
Oh well, what the heck, I just cleaned up the mess
Opened up the closet, got the bullet-proof west
Loaded up the sawed-off, the double-barrel
The rambo knife with the hunting apparel
Threw on the trench, kissed the girl good-bye
She said, ""Special Ed, don't go, you might die""
Started cryin and huggin on me, so I shot her
I said, ""Sorry baby, but I gotta do what I gotta
(You're on a mission)
Do what I gotta
This is a mission, not a small-time thing

Took the express on a air force jet
The thoughts in my mind broke me out into sweat
I was thinkin of the message again and again
In particular the name of Lu Chin Chen
Yo, I landed in Japan with intent to kill
You could tell I wasn't jokin by the look on my grill
Took a look at the picture of the man that I was after
A 5 foot 10 black-belt karate master
Knew where to find him, knew where he would be
I turned around and showin up Mr. Chen found me
I looked him in the eye with a stare so cold
I said, ""I came to revenge for the rhymes you stole
Now you must die, because that is my mission""
He flipped back, got into a fighting position
The tiger style, the shit was wild
He threw his hands in the air, he started to smile
I said, ""You can smile now, but you won't for long
Cause sucker, you'll be sorry that you stole my song""
He said, ""Choose your style"", I broke fool, I said, ""What?""
Pulled out the knife, tried to shove it in his gut
It didn't even cut, I flipped, I started buggin
Pulled out the hand gun, I shot a slug in
His chest, he said, ""Buddah bless"" and stood proud
Out shot the bullet, Mr. Chen just bowed
So I shot him again - yo, I couldn't believe
Mr. Chen caught the bullet in this two front teeth
Yo, he kicked me on the floor just like I was a child
I got fed up, I fought him Flatbush Style
Stood to my feet, threw my hands to the sky
Shaked him then, I faked him, then I caught him in the eye
He started stumblin, yo, I started wildin
He tripped, busted his lip, I started smilin
Knew he was defeated, but I wasn't done yet
So I shot him with the shotie, then I jetted in the jet
(You're on a mission)
Jetted in the jet
This is a mission, not a small-time thing",https://genius.com/Special-ed-the-mission-lyrics
Neva Go Back,Revelations,1995,"I'm gettin' restless, what guest list?
I'm rushin' the percussion, end of discussion
Now, as you were, you rhyme soft like fur
Oh, you write for her?
 Now, that explain it
But I reign it, I rule it, so cool it, while I school it
Listen, to precision
Rhymin', timin', climbin' through your window
(Crooklyn style!) And we in, yo
Ravagin' your whole premises, don't never diss
'Cause here's your address
'Cause mi bad, yes, so come test me now
Like Patra, I got it sewn like Sinatra
Organized crime in effect, snap that neck
Like E-Double if there be trouble
So, move on, there's nothin' to see here
Clear the area, your rhymes are dead
Get the burier to bury ya, I'm very effective, I might add
Original rude, since I was a little lad

I neva go back, I neva flow wack
I just come back, I just come phat

I'm pumpin' like Donovan, plus, I'm a little vicious
I eat MC's 'cause they delicious
It's just that some mistrust but I dust rhymes like a maid
Now, I'm back with How', stompin' like a parade
All up and down Fifth Ave, so if you riff, have plenty of back
'Cause I attack like blood cells, fightin' off diseased MC's
Like Super Friends, in a metropolis, in a super Benz
With Howie, now we got two threes
Fuck it, six, gimme the mix and I'm a kill 'em with the lyrics
So, dig a plot and nigga got, seven
Never doubt, I go all out, salida
You need a map, you need a rap
You need a slap, you need a nap
So, take one, because you're tired
I get so phat, I feel wired
But I never sell, or fall 'cause I never fell


I don't beg, I break your leg like an egg and fry it
Try it, and see what happens when I'm rappin'
Shit start so Get Smart like Max
'Cause cold hard facts prevail, I don't fail
I don't turn pale but I'm very ill, I'm fatal
I rock rhymes like a cradle
Many days, many ways, let me count 'em
Everybody that I caught, everybody thought
But but (bu-bu-but), don't stutter
Just say it, shit is butter
Now, don't that feel better? Get a sweater
'Cause it's gettin' colder, every time I hold a
Mic, niggas freeze up so ease up like, off the scrotum
'Cause you wrote 'em, like you know them
So, let me show them, real rhyme
'Cause I feel I might start buggin' if you don't back up off the mic
The lyrical war is on, and so I strike",https://genius.com/Special-ed-neva-go-back-lyrics
"Come On, Let’s Move It",Legal,1990,"I was proven effective by a clinical test
Because some couldn't come to believe I was the best
So they tested me, and now they in the clinic
They almost arrested me, because I did it
But I didn't mean to do it
But you had to mess with me, and then you blew it
Now you got to chew it, and swallow it all
I guess that's the way that you bounce the ball
Or somethin like that, my mother always told me
Your mother always told me, ""Baby, hold me""
Don't get mad because you don't get g's
And I get extra cheese like pizza
You can't keep your girl because you can't please her
But let's get back to the fact that's been approven
So let me prove it, come on, let's move it
(Come on)
(Yeah y'all, come on)	--]
 
Flavor Flav

I spent time with the rhyme like a person
Rehearsin like a verse in a chapter
Of a play, but 
I rap to
Not make money
Though you might find it funny
But hey, I do it cause I like it, plus it is constructive
Enriching to the mind, cause it's mentally productive
And I am one who seeks special education
Cause I can't learn from the system of my nation
Or should I say my residence run by dead presidents
Cause my mother and brother and father are
]From the motherland of another land called Jamaica
Some of them say God, some of them say Jah is the Maker
But I say why say and who is to say
Cause you make yourself what you are today
And only to yourself do you have to prove it
So come on, let's move it
(Yeah y'all, come on)

Straight from the heart and a shot to the brain
To the hand on the pen and then flaunt the fame
And fortune, suckers I be schorchin and torchin
On and on to victory, me, I be marchin
Each and every day, reachin out to pay
My respects and checks to everybody that helped me on the way
To where I've gotten, thanks a lot and
Everybody out there buyin records by the carton
Thanks to the banks and thanks to the label
Thank you everybody with my record on your turntable
Thanks to the sellers and the distributors
Everybody thank your moms cause she delivered us
Thanks to your pops, he gave the drops of life
Thanks ot the Lord, the sword, the double knife
That I use to fight evil like I fight suckers
Damn, I like jam, so I wanna thank Smuckers
Thanks to my deejay and thanks to my producer
Thanks to the girls cause you let me seduce ya
Thanks to the posse around the way
And thanks to the fans that paved the way
You're coming to the jams, throw your hands in the air and prove it
Come on, let's move it

Taxing,Youngest in Charge,1989,"After I pose for the photos, address the press
I take a rest to let my rhymes digest
Into my brain to sustain and cultivate it
Take a penny for my thoughts, from copper I gold-plate it
Enrich my mind like wine till I find
What I need to exceed with speed, proceed line
Fold it, I take the mic, I grab it and I hold it
Then I walk to and talk to the crowd, cause yo, I sold it
You bought it, you thought it wasn't worth
But the record went gold, it sold, jerk
I'm worldwide, from girls I hide
Not gay, no way, but they all wanna ride
Mine, they bring me roses and wine
But I hate cheap sex, so next time
Come correct like an intellect
Okay, do you hear what I say? Check
Yo, on the rhyme I'm a lyrical joy
And whoever shall front shall be destroyed
The lyrical composer, I produce all legit
My name's Special Ed and yo, your name ain't -
And I'm powerful in my stable mentality
Takin MC's, yes, of any nationality
Blitzin em, dissin em, off I'm pissin em
Makin em solo, broads won't be kissin em
You got taxed, face the facts
Now where's the jokes and all the wisecracks?
You made before you got slayed by the slayer
Special Ed, DJ Akshun on the record player
Chillin, still in the back just maxin
Me in the front, to be blunt, I'm taxin
I'm taxin

When I'm on the mic I make MC's wonder
How I don't make the foul-ups, bleeps or blunders
I'm fool-proof, I'm too couth, too
I got the Uzi for the crew, see, but the hands work for you
I give a fair one, because I never like to scare one
Unless he got a vest and a gun
A like a shoot-out, I like a have a root-and-toot-out
If you like to kick, I got the steel-toe boot out
Cause I'm malicious, vicious on the mic is how I am
And I always do as I like, clause I demand
The utmost respect from you
Because you should give respect where respect is due
To Special Ed, that's my name and that's the title I hold
You're gonna get burned if you wanna get bold
And I'm ready, I let the others call me Eddie
But for you it's Special Ed because I said so, spaghetti
And in the meantime break out the sixpacks and
Cool while I rule, cause I'm taxin
Taxin
I'm taxin
Taxin

Well, if you're lookin for a Brooklyn jam
Here's one you might like about a mic and a man
Well, I be meditatin, then I be waitin for the victim
If they flam then I slam them and kick them
Bite the face, then I taste em and lick them
Like Ray I slay, take a brick and
Brick them, yo, I'm not the typical, massive and large
I'm humongous, but the youngest in charge
In combat I contract with souls like crack
Decompose my foes to the size of toes
Because you get all hype and long-winded
But that ain't it, it's the rhymes that are commended
By the crowd as they start to cheer
With the Cisco, the blunts, and the forties of beer
Cause stimulation is what helps my creations
You know I get mellow before my presentations
Because it helps my rhymes to flow through
Like water, I caught a brew, on second thought a few
To release all the heat that I kept
When I was sober, so now it's overstepped
Aside, and by my rules abide
Protest, yes, and I suggest you hide
Cause I'm comin hummin the song of redemption
Makin stacks, takin tax exemptions
You start to fiend, scream and then holler
For a cigarette, as I get your last dollar
I'm taxin, usin Ajax and waxin
MC's with the fleas in their backs and
Behind their ears and up their butt-cracks and
Keep on till you clean up your act and
Stop hold your nose up like Michael Jackson
Dressin like a bum, cause you don't wear slacks, and
I'm done, thanks, it's been fun practisin
I'm done taxin",https://genius.com/Special-ed-taxing-lyrics
Hoedown,Youngest in Charge,1989,"Yo, I know you know a ho
You might know a few
This jam is about two
Skeezy, sleazy, peasy, low down

(Ho) (ho) (hoedown)

Lucy, I remember Lucy
With the big fat juicy
Watermelons comin out the grocery store
Saw her comin out of the door
I said, ""Miss, can I help you with this?
Please don't diss, I just wanna kiss""
She said, ""Of course,"" kissed with force
Suckin on my lips just like she was a horse
I said, ""Excuse me, please don't bruise me
Please don't tease or skeeze or use me
I'm not like that, I'm not kinky
Would you please remove your pinky
]From my rear?
Can't you hear?
What's the matter?
Get your hands off your bladder
We're standin outside on a crowded block""
I felt her hands goin down on my sock
It said Polo, she was so low down
I coulda swore her knees was on the ground
I said, ""Damn Ma'am, get on your feet
Be on your way, cause you can't have my meat""
Her eyes started waterin, so I brought her
In the store, to buy some more
Tissue, I said, ""Good-bye, I'm gonna miss you""
She said, ""No,"" I said, ""Yo ho, ho-ho, merry Christmas""
This must be a gift, have you ever imagined that if
You was a manget, and a girl was a metal filing
Would they all come piling?
On your body, growin like hair, yeah?
Well, just think of me as there
Didn't need a girl, had plans for the day
Wanted to step, but she wanted me to stay
You could say she was disturbing my peace
So I called the police
Cause yo
This ho was low down
(Hoedown)
And this is the hoedown
(Hoedown)
(Hoedown)
(Ho) (ho) (hoedown)
(Hoedown)
(Hoedown)
(Ho) (ho) (hoedown)

I was coolin on the ave, it was a regular day
Lookin for a girlie, cause I wanted to play
Saw a girl, as I examined her back
Her butt was bigger than a triple dipple Big Mac
As she turned around I had a look at the grill
I said, 'nah - chill'
I turned around, I was about to jet off
When I took a step and bumped into something soft
It was a girl, she was the sweetest thing
Yes indeed, she was a meal, she was fit for a king
I was scopin, but hopin and hopin to rope in
My desire was up, and my resistance was slopin
She said, ""Excuse me, but I was wrong
Maybe I came on a little bit too strong""
I couldn't talk, I couldn't even think
I said, ""Well, can I make it up, can I buy your a drink?""
She gave a nod to show her acception
To my pleasure, but with one suggestion
Yo, to be alone was the suggestion she had
Which was even better, so we went to her pad
I brought the wine that you call rose
We snuggled up in the couch, yes, we got cosy
She put the glass to her lip, and then she took a sip, and
Tried to get up, but she was slippin and trippin
Did a double summersault, the girlie was flippin
Took a step back, took out the hair clip, and
Unbuttoned her blouse, yes, the girlie was strippin
Put her hands on my pants, the zipper was zippin
Laid me down on the couch, sat down on my hip, and
Straddled up, and then she took a dip, and
The girl was sweeter than a chocolate chip, and
I called her name out loud, I said, Jodie - oh!""
I said, ""You must be down with the rodeo
The way you ride, it might sound silly
But you're ridin up and down like Bronco Billy""
Time went by, the sex had stopped
I looked around, I saw Jodie just dropped
What was the matter, yes, the girl was in shock
She said, ""Special Ed, I think it was your -
But never mind, I be fine, just chill""
I said, ""That's what you get for playin Buffalo Bill""
In a minute the girl recuperated
Gave her some soup for strength and she ate it
I then waited till she finished some soup
And then I said, ""Get the hell out, good lookin out, troop""

Ready 2 Attack,Legal,1990.0,"Well, it's 1990, '89 has ended
Now it's time for all those who pretended
To settle and cease with the noise
You and your boys - it's time to put away the toys
Christmas is over and this is my resolution
To stop the confusion
Let the fresh get fresh and the stale get staler
And throw em in a pale of
Trash with the other trash and smash down the lid
For all the weak shit they did
Never in my life have I seen such preposterous behavior
And you got no flavor
Can't taste the juice cause I got the matz
I heard you paid for your _Billboard_ spots
Honest, I promise, I am not a liar
Can't you understand that I am flier than a flyer
No need to try a stunt like that
Never in my life could I front like that
On _Soul Train_ with your brand new hit
When it wasn't even playin cause you ain't sayin -
Nothin, cause they're wacker than wack
Yo Ak - get ready to attack
(Crushin MC's that be tryin to riff)	--] Big Daddy Kane

People say 'new jack', what jack?
You wanna get slapped, Jack
Or get flipped like a flapjack?
I been rockin rhymes and I been rockin mics
Ever since you was on BMX bikes
You was busy braggin bout the mags on your honey
I was in Flatbush tryin to get money
Brooklyn, crookin up the whole damn place
Want to truck jewelry, don't turn your face
But I don't resort to those sort of things
I don't wear big chains or big rings
Gold was stole from caves full of slaves
Now black-on-black, and you're free as waves
In the ocean, without a notion
Am I surfin fast over your head?
Maybe you need glasses or classes in Special Ed
Let me see -
I can fit you in on Monday at 3
Tuesdays is use days
And Wednesdays is friends days
And Thursdays is her's days
And Fridays is my days
And Saturdays is fun days
And Sunday's the one day
I rest, give thanks and bless
Again on Monday I will be back
Yo Ak - get ready to attack
(Crushin MC's that be tryin to riff)	--] Big Daddy Kane

Man your position, let's start dishin
Straight out battlin, no intermission
Ain't no stoppin us, ain't no toppin us
I suggest your best bet is drop and just
Run and don't stop until you drop
You might break your hip, but just hip-hop
But if you wanna go through it, the proceeding
Get a doc, cause when I rock you'll be needing
Medical attention - critical condition
Surgeon's callin, consult a physician
Get a prescription, go to the pharmacy
That's what happens when you don't want harmony
I'm not violent, I stay silent and mutual, I'm neutral
But negative souls wanna interreact
Then I get ready to attack
Yo Ak - let's attack

Freaky Flow,Revelations,1995,"My flow is vivid
I give it two-hundred percent
That's a hundred for me
And a hundred for the rent
I know whatcha meant, Joe, I gotta flow too
Cause they wack every show I go to
I be leavin'
I don't be believing they be even
Believing they own shit
Actin' like they owwwn, shit
Butcha never will
So you better chill
Or getcha grill, peice, torn by the beast
You get the claws
Across your jaws
Hear the roars
Now we gonna lock the doors
Your trapped in a rap like a def game
A left came, then a right, then a fight came
Then a light came, then an eternal night came
Now your in it, in less than a minute
Don't ever try to battle cause your never gonna win it
You better know your limit boy
You better know your limit

""Got a, freaky, freaky, freaky freaky flow"" - Jeru Da Damaja
It's freaky deaky
It's freaky deaky - Brother J

I'm here
Not fronichole, but lyrically present
I'm in the flesh, yo, ain't it fresh
I got that Special Ed shit
Slap that dead shit
Now play dis
Now say dis (your the greatist)
I got enough to stuff into the ladies
I rub her with a rubber
But I'm lyrically raw
Protect your neck and double check your jaw
Cause I'm gettin' bummy
A'yo I'm still gettin' money
Yo, ain't it funny
How you can't take the ghetto out the Ed-O
Maybe I'm just crazy
Why I think, I wanna kill my shrink
I see, pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers
And red blood all over, a dead leprechan
With a time bomb tied to it's arm
In Saigon somewhere on a farm
I gotta calm, down
And hit the wright wire
Or fight fire
Maybe it's a premenission, or intuition
Or some kind of vision
But either way, I'm on a lyrical mission


I think it's because I break the laws of language
Like a sandwich
I eat the whole beat
On whole wheat
Cause it's good for your teeth
Imagine a vaginal nigga like you on the street
Back on the concrete
Feet up
Gettin' beat up
So when we meet up, give your seat up
And rise
The honorable Ed is presiding
Stop biting, stop writing, stop hidin
I hate fish motherfuckers, but I like writting
And snappa, blue fish
I go to one fish two fish
Or some lobster
No I'm not a mobster, but medoddion
If I was white I might say: party on, dude
But I'm the original rude
With the New York talk
So just peep, because the skills go deep
So look, and think about it, before you leap",https://genius.com/Special-ed-freaky-flow-lyrics
I’m Special Ed,Legal,1990.0,"(""I'm Special Ed, my DJ's name is Akshun"") *scratched*

Yes, I'm back because I never did front
Everybody act like it's that time of the month
Because you beef about this then you beef about that
With all of the beef, I get you think I would be fat
But, my metabolism rate goes quicker
'Cause I am a slim, trim, smooth city slicker
I don't perpetrate to be the great or royal
Just shake the hands and the fans stay loyal
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Yo, come here, baby, and let me unbutton your button
Stop frontin' 'cause I want you, I do
Then get your friend 'cause I want her too
Is it possible? Do you think that we could swing it?
If you like the song, come along and sing it
Appreciate the music, that is what it's here for
Therefore, come on, everybody cheer for
The super technological, extracurricular
Adjacent right angles are also perpendicular
I could teach you from what I know in my head
I'm Special Ed
(""I'm Special Ed, my DJ's name is Akshun"") *scratched*

Get your microphone check, 1, 2, and I say to you
How many records do I have to play to you
For you to realize who is the pro in this profession?
'Cause I speak and seek for self-progression
Look at what's happening, I'm not rappin'
I'm just statin' what I'm creatin'
Vocals and percussion, rushin'
Blood to your head which causes flushin'
Your face is pink and getting red
Now you've got the curse of a verse of a
Special Ed rhyme, 'cause I'm on
So turn up the juice 'cause I'ma get loose, word is bond
Chumps try to pose to flex
But I can kick a rhyme battle, break your nose the next
But I don't wanna hurt you or beat you
But, try to diss and I'll dismiss and defeat you
'Cause that's a game that I do not play
No, I wasn't brought up or taught that way
So don't try to tell me what I know already
Plus you don't know me so don't call me Eddie
It's Special, so get it in your head
Especially when the Special is me
'Cause I'm Special Ed
(""I'm Special Ed, my DJ's name is Akshun"") *scratched*

And ya don't stop because I just won't let you do it
I know you bit my rhyme because I saw you start to chew it
Just like some, gum, Bubble Yum
Go ahead, 'cause I'm Special Ed and I'm ready
They used to call me Crazy Eddie
Because I couldn't be beat nor overtaken
Years have gone by and I am still making
More and more, and just like a store, it sells
Like she sells seashells, down by the seashore
But I won't preach about a beach, I just came to reach
And take your mind, kinda like a reminder
Don't you remember who is the finder or who was the founder?
I was around a long time ago but now you know
And knowing is half the battle
But understanding is the other, go ask your mother if you don't
And if don't then you won't
Why stay hidden in the dark?
Because you might get bitten, forget the bark
'Cause yo, I just rush and bust a rhyme that could splatter
'Cause it doesn't matter
I could bust another or the other instead

Fly MC,Youngest in Charge,1989,"I hold the fly microphone in the fly right hand
I'm a real fly guy, better yet fly man
The title that I hold is the fly emcee
Why? Cause I'm fly, yeah, that's me
You see, I'm flier than a flyer to a hip-hop jam
I can even fly higher than a plane from PanAm
Flew, took a flight, yes, to France in the fall
They be cryin when I'm flyin, cause I'm flier than them all
Went to France because I was bored
So I took a flight over on the fly Concorde
On arrival I was greeted by the king of France
The queen, a band playin for the circumstance
Up came the royal crier, he unrolled his scroll and said
""He's flier than the sire and his name is Special Ed""
The king said, ""You really think you're really that fly?""
I said, ""He read it and he said it,"" he said, ""That's a lie""
I said, ""I'm fly, I never lie and, yo, my name is Special Ed
And if you don't get out my face, I'm gonna fly your royal head""
The king tried to call on his royal troops
Pulled out the Uzi and the king said, ""Oops!""
Up jumped the queen, she called me a nut
So I kicked her in the butt, then I slapped the royal slut
Said, ""Silence! Stop the violence, hear what I have to say - eh""
The tuba played a note, so I shot the tuba player
Hell broke loose, the queen just rushed me
Grabbed me by my pants, began to hush me
Pushed me on the plane, dragged off the shoes
The Levi button fly, 501 blues
Ripped off the shirt, took off her royal crown
Disrobed the royal robe, took off the royal gown
Hotter than a stove, worked me over, she was illin
She was suckin me and fuckin like a heated gorilla
Thought to myself, could this really be true, and
Yo, then I thought: yo, what the hell am I doin?
Gave her her clothes and I said, ""Good night""
Opened up the door, but the plane was in flight
She said, ""Special Ed, we're in the middle of the sky!""
I said, ""So? I know, you don't have to fly,"" I
Licked the switch and flew the latch
Then I kicked the bitch through the cargo hatch",https://genius.com/Special-ed-fly-mc-lyrics
The Bush,Youngest in Charge,1989,"Brooklyn, New York, Flatbush to be specific
Is the topic of the composition, so people, if it
Offends, I recommend you get off, you soft tush
Come down, come around to the Bush, the Bush
Live in the Bush, Flatbush, that is the place
Where I rest with the blessed, don't jest, it is a waste
To try, you might die, so I abort the mission
Try to fight, you might end up in critical condition
Cause we don't take shorts, not here, not in the Bush
And if you wanna get around, you gotta know how to push
The boys make noise and the girls be slappin curls out the head
Try to fight back, black, you get dead
In the Bush
The Bush
We got the brothers with the heads in dreads
On the corners like pigeons
Smokin marijuana but it's their religions
We got the others on the pipe tip
Goin on the flight trip
Soon on the toon, your mother will right-grip
Basin up the world, chasin up the girls
The fire got too high till you're facin up your curls
Now you're burned, learned your lesson
Stop messin with the crack, black, cause now look how you're dressin
Chokin and totin on the pipes and the woolers
While the dealers are your friends with the Benz plus medullahs
And rings, they're kings because of what they push
And they're part of the heart in the Bush, the Bush
I'm Special Ed, and yes, I'm takin it all
The school that I attend is Ersamus Hall
Live in Flatbush, yes, I'm on
No, I'm not a god, but my word is bond
I got the knowledge, wisdom, understandin
Not fussy, but demandin
No, I'm wise, understand
Mess with me, I break your hand
Stop your heart, take your breath
With the diagnose of death
Remove your brain from your skull
Make ya dumb, make ya dull
Sow you up and cut your hair
Put you in a science fair
Tell em that your name is John
Make you a phenomenon
Freak of nature, make em hate ya
Not a girl will ever date ya
So step off, because you're soft, and I'm a soldier
Go get your crew, and you can tell em what I told ya
Tell em how I burned ya, how you got dissed
Then form a line, so I can add em to the list
If you come to the Bush keep a low pro
Cause you might catch a knot or a shot or a blow
To the face in this place, if you base you will be broken
Comin off the train you gotta pay another token
What this means is, you pay for your protection
Pay a fee and never see a reflection
Again, my friend, or rather foe, you know the deal
Either hear or feel
Choose one, but at least you got an option
Be my son or be up for adoption
Why in heaven's name would you diss?
Do you wanna kiss a fist?
We can do this, properly, you're on my property
This ain't a game, but you can say it's a monopoly
Cause I control the total supply, and you're the user
Akshun makes the cuts and Howie Tee is the producer
We make it or break it, so take it just like that
Yes yes y'all, we're all from Flat-

This is a monster jam
I'm a vet, yet I never been in Vietnam
But come to think of who I am
It's not amazing that you're praising all the lyrics I flam
When I'm bustin a discussion to the percussion
I leave it to the Flatbush Crew to do the rushin
Cause I'm kinda laid back, MC's please stay back
If you try to riff, you'll be stiff on the way back
Home, inside a box with bottles and rocks
I know the time, you know why? because I got nuff clocks
In my house, always like to know the time of the day
Take a shower every hour to be sure that I stay
Fresh and never less, because I don't like germs
On the mic I like to psyche by usin phrases and terms
That only I could begin to comprehend
And understand how I use and choose the lyrics that blend
Monster Jam
This is a monster jam

I got the dope hype--type style
Try to bite, we might fight and you will not smile
Cause I'ma damage and ravage, you are a savage
I'ma choke your mediocre, novice, average
Ass into a pulp, then I'ma gulp ya up
]From out a cup and leave you without a hope
I'm only dope, yo, I'm just provokin your brain
I like to tease, I like to skeeze, I got a brother named Wayne
And I'm a Taurus, I brush my teeth and also use ???
I'm a king, I like to sing, I got a choir and a chorus
I was born on the 16th of May
You do not have to know the year, just be concerned you hear the day
So you can bring me my crown and then king me
Rejoice to the choice voice, then sing me
A song, make it long, so that I can hear
The praise for days and days and days to the next year

I'm a special professional, my kind is ???
The rhymes are so precise just to the fraction of a decimal
Rhyme, so sensational, I'm very educational
This is a presentation, I guess it's presentational
Yo, I'm Special Ed, I get the bread, I get the cash
Don't steal, I make it, try to take it, get bashed
I am protective and selective when I choose my rhymes
Unlike the other MC's I make g's, not dimes
I got a rhyme to keep you rockin all the time
Like I said I'm Special Ed, if you don't like it - the heck
Cause I'm a slow pace, never race, never smoke the crack base
]From the pipe or the wooler, not a fool, much cooler
Not dunce, smoked once, never ever choked once

Ya Wish Ya Could,Legal,1990,"(Hope to be dope as me)	--] Guru

I can rock a beat, plus rock a rhyme
I feel it's time to show my full versatility
Nothin is impossible, I have the ability
I see one, don't you woke, you wake up
Take up your mic and take off your make-up
This style I made up just of dust
Because suckers like you I will burn to a crust
You might think you're hard, but even iron got to rust
I bust rhymes like a cherry
You might think I'm nasty - yes, I'm very
Cause I do it right just for you
And I could rock it all night if you want me to
So just lay back and let your head float
Like a boat on the open sea
But leave your mind open to me
So I can put into it
The sound, as it goes around and through it
Just like a merry-go
Though where we go
You wish you could

There's no particular style, I only say as I feel
And if I say it, you obey it and kneel
And if you're still standin, I'ma put my hand in a fist
Then apply the force to my wrist
That'll surely floor ya, forget your lawyer
If you try to sue me, I'ma say I never saw ya
You're just a stranger, boy, I will derange ya
Change ya, why put yourself in any danger?
So step out the way or get stomped
You're soft and off, I'm on time with the rhyme, I'm prompt
For the simple fact that I got rhythm
So does DJ Akshun, of course the force is with him
So does Howie Tee, cause now we see what we have done
Look what we created, and we made it for fun
You try to make it better, cause it sounds so good
But you wish you could

Rest for a second and just reconcile
And play the record while
You listen to the style of a specialist
I'm a professional at this
I'm here to fix all the things you missed
I'm a perfectionist
I seek to be exact
All I need is just a mic and a track
I'm a vocalist, and I'm a soloist also
I sit back and watch too many fall, so
Straight from Flatbush, Brooklyn in the house
Diss the Bush and get mushed in the mouth
You might consider me a hood - good
But I got more money than you wish you could
In my socks, and no, I don't sell no rocks
Though on the microphone I got this sewn
Hemmed, stemmed like a stone
And you don't stop, because it feels so good
But you wish you could",https://genius.com/Special-ed-ya-wish-ya-could-lyrics

This right here
For all them niggas that like to talk
Talk the talk
You better walk the walk

When I see you in the dark

I wage war on stage or street
I battle defeat
Relentless
You get shot like tetanus
Feel the wetness
Gush
I'm in a rush
No time to sigh
Now die
Shit is so fly that I gotta get clearance
In case I enter air space interference
Mach 1
When I rock, son
Cause I take off
While you make fake soft
Little jingles
Sell a few singles
But that ain't shit
Cause a hit ain't a hit without the lyricalist
And at 22
I'm takin any crew
At any time
Cause many rhyme
But a lemon ain't a lime
And I don't falsify to get by
You must be more than herbally high
To verbally comply
To my vocal range
I get strange when I change
Into the syllable killer
So beware
Cause I'll be there
Lurkin, workin
Till your head hurtin

(Hey yo Ed) What? (Niggas wanna talk!)
(Now let's see if they walk the walk!)	(3x)

I break and bruise the backs
Of musical acts
Cause I slam harder than a steel door
I'm real raw, so nigga, what you feel for?
I'm straight to the point, like a line
Me and this mic of mine
Stay tight, whether I write or freestyle
You see style
You never thought existed
I'm unlisted
You can look, but you'll never locate
Where I rotate
Cause I never stop or rest, and I ain't
You get wet like paint
You feel faint, you wanna faint
You can't stand me, the man with the stuff
Come with bullshit and get snuffed, cream puff
You are pastry
Cause you be tasty
When I'm eatin em
Beatin em into mince meat
I never been sweet
You don't wanna come on my street
In the heat
Son, gashes
Hot flashes
Sun first
I come gun first
Feet second
I keep wreckin
So you can keep on checkin


I'm nice like a old lady
Similak, baby
Pure, nourrishing
Rhymes flourishing
I know you're starvin, come and get a taste
Bring the beef and I'll discard the waste
Shit ain't the same
Things done changed
Now I got your whole life re-arranged
Till I say so
Now you're livin every day slow
Cause everybody nervous
But this is professional mic service
Dummy, now give me the money
Before I put one in your honey
Cause Sonny don't Cher
Hands in the air
I drug it so rugged, those panty hose tear
I give you a run for yours
I won wars
I burn niggas like sauce
Don't ever underestimate the power of the force
Mark Spark the chalk
And turn the lights off dark

The main attraction DJ Ak-Shun for your pleasure or your leisure
Try to match the scratch and you will end up in a seizure
Strain upon your brain, you can't contain the plain fact
That if you tried to cut this hard I bet your record would crack
Or either break, what does it take to make your hair-do
I have to put a speaker to your ear for you
To say, ""Hey, I like the way the deejay is playin""
Cause that's what you'll be sayin
You'll say, ""I want a deejay just like that one""
(Inside di action)
(I want action)
(Action)

I'm Special Ed, my deejay's name is Ak-Shun
Put together we're two, yet we're both number one
Cause Ak-Shun got the scratchin, as well as the catch
And I the funky super psychodelic words that match
And we're the best at what we do, in our professions we're the highest
Is it understood, we're very good, if not, try us
One thing to know if you decide to disprespect
Is if you're weak we reserve the right to reject
We don't waste time with toys or weak crews
Wanna rhyme, get in the line, I take you out by the twos
And Ak-Shun, try to battle him, you're gonna need luck
He's a destroyer, he'll destroy ya, make ya self-destruct
Explode like a bomb into pieces, so then
Superglue couldn't put you back together again
And oh, by the way, you say you want satisfaction
Well, all you had to say was (I want action)
(I want action)
(Step back)

What a man, it's Ak-Shun that remarkable man
If you heard that he could do it, he can do it, he can
If you heard it, if you word it with your lips, what I mean
Is that he cuts so clean, you would think he was a dream
You had, the man is bad, yet the man is not a nightmare
I don't think that it's right or rather quite fair
To a new deejay, you '86er
You can't be the man who was born on a mixer
If you think you broke a record, Ak-Shun is the fixer
If you need a remedy, Ak-Shun uv is the elixir
Cause if he picks her, then he gets her and he sticks her
On to the record player and then he licks a
Fingertip for more attraction
And then he makes her say (action) (I want action)",https://genius.com/Special-ed-ak-shun-lyrics
5 Men And A Mic,Legal,1990,"Yo it's on right?
Yooo! and you don't stop, what's up y'all?
Yo this is Special Ed and we chillin' out here in the basement
Rockin' it live in Flatbush
We got Howie Tee behind the boards
We got my brother Wayne over there sittin' down
We got Little Shawn sittin' down
We got 40 sittin' down
We got my brother Drew sittin' down
We got DJ Akshun
We got DJ Akshun
, yo, what I'ma do right, I'ma let my boys get a little loose on this track right here
So first on the mic is my man Drew, so you can do whatcha like

I consume and digest and take a rest
Pack my mic, then strap my vest
Onto war, sound the charge of the brigade
I'm ready to battle, state and get paid
Dropping bodies like  so watch your back
'Cause I'm strapped and I'm ready to attack
In fact, you lack the skills to get ill
So I crushed you on sight with the scope to kill
On target, I might just bust without discuss
Watch the bloodbath, no man can take this much fury
When I'm on a jewel heist
But I don't steal jewels I just get  on the mic
Visit to create the scene
Brought to you from Drew and dope team
This is how I let off steam so make way
Yo 40, tell 'em what you gotta say

How many times must I pull the trigger?
My rhyme is automatic so now it's kinda figure
Should I release a masterpiece of my music?
You heard it once before so don't you confuse it
40-Love the name and Brooklyn's the back up
Lived here all my life so don't try to act up
Play this game for keeps I only got one shot
Plan to make it good or I lose my spot
My rhyming skills served as my sixth sense
With the lyric lashing breaks down your defense
Go for 40 days and 40 nights
Drink the 40 dog, had 40 fights
MCs come in all different types
But they don't know, don't believe the hype
Once I touch the mic you better save you breathe
'Cause you just faked the final sense of death
Kick a couple of rhymes now it's time to be gone
Next on the mic is my man Little Shawn

Get, get up out your seats, let's begin
'Cause I'm the L-I-double T-L-E-S-H-A-W-N
Just give me a pen, I'll fill it to the rim or until you say when
The rhymes I write are hyped up for your pleasure
The styles I use change up like the weather
Tall and good looking if I may say so
I don't joke or kid or play although I know
Some might say I possess a sense of humor
The fact that I'm bad on the mic is not a rumor
Any mistakes that I make will be corrected
'Cause when the mic's in my hand I'm respected
'Cause no one is half the MC that I am
'Cause I'm hot, potent and fly, superb and  and oh
'Cause you know a lot of rappers talk junk and yes
On the mic they flunk 'cause Little Shawn got funk
And on the microphone I'm fed
Last but not least is the man Special Ed

I don't know where to start so I will where I am
Sittin' in my chair as I prepare another jam
Not a jam sandwich but another man which can
Lyrically withstand an attack
Verbally, I'm superbly packed
WIth vitamins E and D
Take 'em and you might feel like but you can't be like me
'Cause there is only one like the one sun in the solar system
'Cause I revolve and twist 'em
Into pretzel, like figures of flesh
That's what happens when you figure you're fresh
And then 'fess
Now clean up the mess
Now send it back to sender if you remember the address
Just hop back in your box
Tell 'em where you live and someone knocks
Because when you positively got to be there overnight
Try to battle, I'ma cook ya then book ya flight
I know I shouldn't help out a sucker MC
'Cause I'm a frequent fly ya so I fly miles for free
And ya don't stop!
Yo, yo, yo, yo Ed, yo Ed it ain't over yet
Ak gotta get some, you thought I couldn't rhyme?
Check this out

At first, I put your rhymes to a hold stop
Go for your jugular vein, take out your voicebox
Leave you speechless 'cause you can't beat this
Have a seat 'cause I'm about to teach this
So say your last goodbyes 'cause nothing can save ya
Get on your knees, bow your head and pray ya
I'm like the mafia I give you a kiss and that's my sign...and your deathwish
Actions are warrior, I would do more of ya
One, two, three, or four of ya, don't care if I know of ya
An opportunity like this I can't pass up
Give me the microphone and I'ma light that ass up
'Cause I'm hittin' hard in 1990
And funky would be the best word to describe me
You can ask any brother am I hypin' it?
And simply reply, you're damn right
Put your mic down boys, save that chit-chat
'Cause yo true, you could get a big smack

Yeah that's why I'm sayin'
Cause you know we ain't playin'
My man Ak
My man 40 Love
My man Little Sean
My man the brother Drew, my brother Drew
My brother Wayne in the house
Howie Tee is in the house
I'm in the mizza-fucking house

See, they be dyin

New suit, no shoes, no clues
I mind my business, you better mind yours
I'm steppin to jaws

Gotta eat, got a street, let's pump it
Blow that shit up like a trumpet
No doubt, baby, maybe when they be thinkin
Shit is dead, we split his head, hit his crib
Yo, fuck that, my nigga Big I just did his bid
We need a steady flow, ready-go, get the ifth
Let me hit the spliff, let's do this
Yo, tell em who dis, the rudest
Like a nudist I got no shame
I put the flame to your perimeter claim
Fuck po-po, I smoke em like cocoa
In fronto pronto

Under fire cook the cocoa to the base
Easy money, bee's honey, sweet, brick city street
Cold flip with the whole strip, deep
Gettin z's yet I never sleep
I be up, I re-up, and then I transact
My man's packed, I do too

So you die still

Livin’ Like a Star,Legal,1990,"Yo, I used to be in love with this girl named Jill
I know why, because she had the butt like that of a hill
But you couldn't tell me nothin, cause Jill was number one
Cause to me, oh my God, how she made me come
I shoulda knew the consequences from the get-go
She would use me like a puppy from a pet show
But like a fool in love I fell for her game
But ah - I got mine everytime I came
You know the place, Flatbush Avenue
Where I first met the hoe, I said, ""Yo, haven't you
Been around before, did we get down before?
I forget, but I bet I met you in a store
Mickey D's - yeah, now I remember""
She said, ""That was for school, I needed money in September
Cause I'm a member of the Booster Squad""
And I was thinkin to myself: I knocked her boots so hard
That's just what I did, until we had a kid
Now the bitch got half my money, plus the crib
Plus the car, plus the limo with the bar
But I guess that's what you get when you're livin like a star
Livin like a
Livin like a
Livin like a star
Every day I wake up, I take up my pen
I write a dope rhyme, then I stretch and bend
And I excercise, wipe the boogers out my eyes
And so on... let me go on to the surprise
I'm chillin in my couch in a slouch-like position
Thinkin of a way to spend the day like fishin
Nah - dairy - yeah - cheese
Yo, that's the way to go, but no polly-o, please
Picked up the phonebook, lookin at the pages
Lookin at the star rating right beside the ages
Looked under 'x' for 'sex' and saw Stacy
Yeah, you know the one that we call Dick Tracy
Yes, I think that she can solve my case
So I call her on the phone, she was home alone
She said, ""Come over to my place, I'll cook dinner""
Ring-ring-ring-ring - I think we got a winner
Threw on some dip for the trip across town
Yo, I got to go, cause the hoe is down
So I hopped inside of the rented Corolla
Saw another girlie, she was pushin on a stroller
I said, ""Yo baby,"" then ""Hello, mother""
And then I said, ""Wait a minute, where is the other?""
She said, he said, he wasn't stayin with her
""But maybe we can drop the baby by the sitter
And go for a ride, if I was you, I'd consider""
I dropped the kid off about three blocks away
Went back to the Bush to collect my pay
When I got to the crib ma dukes was home
So I couldn't go inside, cause then I couldn't bone
Bone - T-Bone - yeah, good thinkin
Got to his crib faster than you could blink, and
T-Bone was home alone, I said, ""T
You got to look out now, come on now, this is me
I got cheese, and she's bein naughty""
I heard some footsteps, then came 40
40 Lover smooth like groove to the butter
He was busy guzzlin a 40 like water
He said, ""Ed, let's go get another
No, get two for me, you and my brother""
I said, ""Bet, while I jet just wait""
Went outside just a minute too late
I didn't know where the hell honey dip went till
I saw the cheese breeze by in my rental
Oh, it's sugar, she stole my car
But I guess that's what you get when you're livin like a star

Here I Go Again,Revelations,1995,"Straight up
You'll get ate up
Wait up
Hold up
(Here I go)
(Here I go)
(Here I go again)		--] Lords Of The Underground

Greetings, welcome to the proceedings
You won't be needing your seating
For this lyrical meeting, there's no eating
And no biting, fighting is in the lobby
I didn't know that so much dough was in a hobby
My last rhyme was a pasttime, yet at present
I present the scent - smell
The funk from below hell
]From where I fell
But I still got my soul
So I'm never gonna sell
I'd rather tell it just like it is
Plus it's my mic, so act like it is
You can ask Giz, you can ask anybody
I rock any party, word to Miz
(It ain't he Biz) So what it is?
Straight up, you'll get ate up just like breakfast
If it's a bunch, then that's lunch, and in the next is
Dinner, now who's the lucky winner for the evening?
Flex and you won't be leaving, or even breathing
I had to come back, so there ain't no misbelieving
(Here I go)
(Here I go)
(Here I go again)

You thought I was gone, but my word is bond
I was in the deadzone, with the headphones on
Just meditating, then I be waiting for a
Light snorer, then it's off to Bora-Bora
Beyond the dawn, past the corn and wheat fields
The street feels great, how the beat feels?
Get the reels and the deals is done
I be back, hon, I gotta drop it on the one
So give me my hat and my gun, I gotta run
I got a ton of styles, but you can't get none
I wipe you out like a disc, tisk-tisk
Tough stains need whisk', but I can't take the risk
I gotta take em out myself to make sure
I break them legs like eggs when they raw
Billy McGhee McGhaw, they all cried
They all died, they all tried
But they got cut like King Tut, then wrapped
]From a dummy to a mummy, let's see how you adapt
I cut the crap, and act like you know then
Here we go then, I'm explodin
(Here I go)
(Here I go)
(Here I go again)

It's about time to drop the rhyme
And take cover, shelter, atomic melter
Shutdown, what now, I got nut now
Two nine-fitties just like titties
Rockin the sound I break down in the cracks on the trackboard
Like Shaq on a backboard
I shatter musical matter
And make it even fatter than it was
Word up, cuz, I got a buzz
That is what the ism does
So I'm in a trance, I need a chance to escape
They said I'd be alright if I just made another tape
But I don't think it's gonnda do it
I been through it
I get a shock everytime I rock
I'm unstable, and unable to relax
I hear tracks and relapse
Perhaps I got the raps, quick
I'm bout to have another fit...

Everyday Iza Gunshot,Revelations,1995.0,"Since way back when
Fucking up shit with the pad and the pen
Ran shit before so I run shit again
40's back
I'm the Bounty hunter
Only escape is six feet under
I be lurking, waiting, debating, anticipating
Take you out on Church or on Dayton
Yeah it's on and Babylon is on my back
Cool and relaxed always gotta stay strapped
Bust caps perhaps
If I catch ya in a beef
Fuck around and bust out the bwoy's front teeth
In fared on the head, yeah good as dead
Go check the dread and get me a phat head
If that the way it gotta be then it gotta be
Not dying at 23
Looking more towards the year 2040
I'll probably still being to court G

I had to come out and dumb out cause I'm from out the way
And Church Avenue ain't having you
So go back to your wack block with your crack rock
No don't let me  Glock
Cock bang then go to Bangkok
And lay low
I don't play yo
Fuck ceelo, give me some yayo, a kilo
And let me flip it, I'll get more equipment
Yeah, yeah, plus another shipment
I don't play games with dames or with flames
Or with names
Don't call mine or you're all mine
Don't cross the war line
I don't play that
So say that
Forget the drama or I get your mama
On Christmas, dis ya must admire
Ya must embod'
Ya must wan' meet God
Well I'll be glad to introduce you
He could use you
A soul on a roll
And I'm in total control
Of the situation
I rule the nation
Indivisible
I'm invisible you can't see me
Word to Mimi, I'm like a genie
Cause I appear and disappear and reappear
And miss a year
You know why?
I got the antidote for civilization (what's that?)
Eradication
 {x2}
Everyday is a gun shot
Lord have mercy

Set sail
On the seven seas
Roll like a pirate Shanghi'ing MC's
Walk the plant
Deep into the water
That's an order
No sign of manslaughter
Why?
This kids head I'm about to fly
Always talking about the I.N.I
And I.N.I
I ain't the one since the shit begun
Look down the barrel of my dirty magnum
I walk the streets after dark
Hear the gun bark all ya see is a spark
A big flash so I dash up the block
Followed by a cop brandishing his Glock
Road blocks ahead now I'm caught in-between
No time to think, loading the magazine
I'm going out for broke
No joke
Won't stop till the end of the gun smoke
Won't be framed or blamed
If I get caught then the story will be changed
Only evidence is I've tape recorded
Heads got it on a flight that's now boarded
Told 'em in case of emergency, make a copy
Give one to gangsta and the other Reverend Jessie
He'll know what to do with that
And just remember to always stay black
Holy shit, kinda funny to me
Guess who set me up (who?)
Rudolph Giuliani

Ya Not So Hot,Legal,1990,"(It's so
- hot -
I'm burnin up)

This is commercial, nothin controversial
Or offensive, it's not expensive
So why don't you buy it, riot
Rampage, rush the stage
But don't try to front, I got the 12-gauge
No bodyguard, got Akshun on the tables
Tangle - get strangled with his cables
It's not a threat, it's a bet, word
Cause I roast you like a bird, cut you in a third
Of a fraction, give Akshun a little peace
Yo Howie, now we got a feast
Or a meal, cause suckers who steal I will be pawin
Get ready at 8 cause Eddie ain't ate, and I'm starvin
Just like Marvin Gaye
I heard it through the grapevine around the way
You be perpetratin and I be hatin
Things like that, so now, black, I sit back waitin
And waitin for your arrival
And the end of your survival
Every single day you will decay and just rot
Ya not so hot
(It's so
- hot -
I'm burnin up)

Your physical being will start fleeing
Your brain will feel the pain, and you will start peeing
Your Fruit Of The Loom's till it consumes
Your trousers, wowsers, golly, I'm dope
See what I mean? If not, then here's a telescope
Take it, but don't break it
Then return when you learn how to make it
Like this, comin off and gettin busy
You need a hyper type of diaper, you pissy little sissy
You little whinin, naggin, braggin, smellin like midnight dragon
What's the matter, your diaper still saggin?
Get huggies, they don't leak
Then I might not notice that you're weak
Because you always say the rhymes that I heard the other day
I come fresher every night - after I pray
I sit down and write, and then I lay in rest
Get up in the morning, get dressed, not to impress
It's too much stress on the brain, MC's strain to be the best
Or the biggest, or better they get enormous
You think you're hot, but you don't even warm us
Ya not so hot
(It's so
- hot -
I'm burnin up)

I use natural resources, creative forces
So high-potent that a sucker MC lost his
Ability to function, and he collapsed
So before you blink just think that perhaps
It can happen to you, cause it can, my man
Cause yo, I'ma bag you up and put you in a trash can
And then send you off to the dumps
Chumps, I'ma give you nuff lumps
In your cranium
Where he at, just name he him
And I'ma find him and come from behind him
And take him and break him and bind him
And then line him with a lining and a designing
Put him in the window when the sun comes shining
In the morning, blow the horn and toot the whistle
Set it off with the pistol
But you was finished way before the first shot

Cause it's a fact that me and Ak, we don't lack
We got excess, we comin express on the track
We runnin over the wack
And MC's, we got the bomb
And it's fatter than Dom DeLuise
You can't see the knees
That's how fat it is
So that it is
I know it like a poet
And I owe it to my peeps, so I keeps on top
Like a wig, ya dig?
It's the nig with the six fig status
According to my rhyming apparatus
I am nimbocumulus, and you are just a stratus
I tower over
I got the power nova
I move tides when my rhyme collides
I cause rockslides
I open the ground with sound
That's bound to drown a small town
Or village, causing spillage into the forest
I'm rougher than Chuck Norris
Only he's pretending
And my shit is rough till the endin

My mind went
Now I'm bent
And starin at cement
Repeatin and repeatin

Save the brave role
Cause it don't matter how old
Or young, you're gettin hung
Straight from the ceiling
Straight from the ceiling
Don't fake the feeling

So you can put your hands up
But it don't stands up
So bring your mans up

Word to Gotti, I need a puddy
I'm shittin, my shit is hittin
Like a collision, I get a commission

I'm fat, and you're malnutritioned
And I'm fully conditioned

Burn me? Are you crazy?
Stop pretending

There ain't no muthafuckin match
But I got a lighter
If you wanna be a fighter

Did a lot better with a one-nighter
And yet you wanna get with a vet
You put a canned ham in the middle of 'Nam
You'll get attacked and ate raw
By the war pack
But I never swine
Never mind, I'm fine
But come test, and you'll rest in a shrine
Forevermore, nevermore
Have I felt so raw
Unlock the door
Because I'm comin on stage
But stand back from the cage
Because I maim, they can't tame
At any age I rip off the hand with the whip
Now give me that microchip
And them papers
I'm runnin capers
I got the nuclear vapors
Fuck the spot, I'ma blow up the world

I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speakin' so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessin
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothin for security
I get paid when my record is played--to put it short
I got it made
I'm outspoken, my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cuz coolin is all that I'm about
Just foolin wit tha girlies, yes I'm bustin it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cuz I'm the boss
I never will cuz I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until--
I choose
Which I won't cuz I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're invitin me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect cuz I--
Got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kinda fond of honda scooters--got seventy-four
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta frog--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti cuz I own a percent
Got gear out wear--to everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made
I'm kinda spoiled, 'cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
And when the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me, I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader, if what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cuz my waiter made potato -n- alligator souflee--

Druggin your mind with em one at a time
I hit em up with a couple of bars
I'm breakin MC's up like rock guitars
At a Kiss concert, but not this concert
Ain't no make-up, you better wake up
Before the sandman come take your hand
I come into your dreams, or so it seems
While you're deep asleep I'm beginnin another scheme
Gettin that dough, hittin that ho
In the video, what a bitty, what a pity
But that's the chance you take when you make it
You get strung when the song is sung
But I don't hit notes, I hit quotes I wrote, so
If you know like I know, you better not try no
Dummy move, yo money, move from the mic
Exit stage right, nighty night
Time for bed with a rhyme from Ed
So put on your pijamas and tell your mamas
Beddy-bye, till you're ready to try once more
Cause I'm takin niggas out like a one-night whore
To the store, so who you're really tryin to fool?
We rule, you know we rule
We rule, you know we rule

It gets harder and harder
Cause everybody got to start a
Kid-type hit, but forget that bullshit
I'm on some hype shit, my style is well developped
When I envelop a mic I would like everyone to get the hell up
I set it off, headed off right to the mic
I let if off like an airstrike
I cover the ground with surround sound
Everybody get down before you're left deaf
So what the eff, a duel to the death
Like Macbeth, so kneel to the left
And bow your head, now Ed will rule
I'm takin niggas out like a trip at school
To the park, leadin you into the dark
Now form a double-line, it's trouble time
Now I got to rhyme double-time
Or triple
Cause MC's suck like nipple
I cripple, but they already lame
I come to claim your name and eat your brain
Right out your skull like a monster
And I do what I wantsta when I wantsta
And I ain't even gotta carry the tool
Cause we rule, you know we rule
We rule, you know we rule

I got rhymes a cop can't stop
They don't even chase, so don't even waste
Gas, I'm too fast, I come equipped to rip, money grip
Cause you the paper
And I'm the Flatbush raper
I rip shit up, your get hit up
I don't take sex, just checks and cash
Stompin niggas out like the Monster Mash
Every single day of the week, plus weekends
You and your weak friends tryin to meet ends
But you can't make em meet, cause you can't make a beat
So now you're beaten, you're meat and you're lookin all meek
You couldn't see me on the highest peak
With a long-range scanner and a antenna
Cause you're fish like a can of
Tune, all on my dock, in my scuna
I see ya later, if not, sooner
So just cool
Cause you know we rule",https://genius.com/Special-ed-we-rule-lyrics
It’s Only Gettin’ Worse,Revelations,1995,"Aight
The mic sound right so set it, what
When I'm done fucking up the mic, I embed it nuff
So let me do my thing thing, shoutouts to Sing-Sing
Broadway, Rikers and them niggas the lifers
My brothers Kevin, Kane, went down for a nickel
And me want to smoke some pork then sick em with a pickle
That's why I gotta stay in my rep
Cause I don't rest and I don't test
And don't flinch
You about an inch from sinch zack
Back to the stack, save the act for acts
So he could giggle while you wiggle and wallow
You can't swallow, can you?
I command you, I can't stand you so I damn you
Into the dark, heart, who goes?
I know you got a record but you're whack at the shows
So if you're thinking about, about ya self
Don't even go there (Where?)
Don't even go that route

Its only getting worse
I think I'm gonna burst
Its only getting worse
I know I'm gonna burst
Its only getting worse
I'm about to burst
Its only getting worse
Yo I'm gonna burst

I'm taking over the venue, so pretend you was the ??????
Disperse this verse, mic first
Lyrical disaster, faster and faster, past the speed of sound
Give me a track and I'mma beat it down
No need to axe me twice, I whack spice
Quite nicely, thanks and yourself
Oh my bad, you never had no skill
Well not until you heard me get ill
Don't ever try to lie to the provider
I back smack your whack ass back to class
You didn't pass, I should've had you selling that ass
But I gotta get back to the community black
So here's more styles to memorize, rise
I wreck and resurrect, build and still kill
And I'm still ill, see skill
You can't go against such immense defense
And it's only getting worse so it don't make sense


I arrange the strange, interchanging
Raging, letter paging, getting better as I'm aging
I'm not new to this, I rooted this
Chirst rap like, so now I'm in the mix
But I won't dilute so I shoot and I shoot
No retreat, you better know the street, 31st
Yo its only getting worse on church
They search where I lurk
But I murk too swift as I past 3-5th
With a spliff, don't shift
Cuz I got the auto, with a clutch you can't touch
Listen to the hammer, quick
That's what's up, now what?
Shut up, I don't mud up
You get dug up or drug up
To the lock away on rockaway
The hell lab, shit is mad
Hot up in the piece
They shot up the beast
So the lights won't come
Plus we don't run son, done",https://genius.com/Special-ed-its-only-gettin-worse-lyrics
See It Ya,Legal,1990.0,"See it ya
When me-a chat, you know it's that
You didn't have to respond
Put this in my video send me it
Fear of James Bond
I float on the boat, 'pon water and land
Come back in a different style
I know you can't understand
Come when me chat upon the mic
Jah knows upon the version
Is my selector DJ Action?
'Cause it don't matter what them do
Want it, don't matter what they say
'Cause when it gets away
Them mice them all go play
But it never know say that
Me coded the chat this way
Through I was born in Brooklyn
But the rest are from J.A
I know we all live in America today
I saw my dem and I say, this and that
But if me catch you boy
You and your posse are go flat
Then don't get me vexed
'Cause I will take out my frustration
And you will hear the sound
Of a round of radication
Pure shot of liq, but a pure shot I bust
'Cause me not know the dred
But then I Jah Jah, trust me
'Cause these are the workings of the lord
Yes, my selector action pull up
And come in a different style and fashion
Mine like cool it, come from flashin' culture lyrics
So see it ya

Lord love is mercy
They call it man and I live party
Everybody come listen me, lord
They come and do a little things, but me cold chill
Me know a little things, but me call 'cha
Me name they call me money, is a bon rasta
Me come from the country boy, when them call Juda
Where emblem complete with three meedra colla
Miss a red, green and gold, make me proud sir
The red is for the blood where we shed, ay yah
Where the black people shed when an evil man massacre
The green is for the trees
Where spring up from the earth-cha
It fed me, it from a dum child in earth-cha
The goal is for the son created by the father
Is a necessary element for our survival
The alien of the near, shine them, say ""A Ganja""
It bring wisdom and knowledge and also power
Me say don't know to watch a J
They lick the child away
And when them finished, don't look in them eye
Them red like fire
Then them run to me, and start figgin' my leg-cha
And say when Jesus walk the earth
He drop them as a preacher
And teaching in the temple through the scribes of elder
Him teach them 'bout the one, who them call Lucifer
When him kneel upon the cross, imagine oh him so far
As I call a man, come forgive him a cold-cha
'Cause I know any MC can't talk like me
Come here I owe them a tactical rip
And me no gonna stand many people
And rock while I smokin' 'em out
Smile them and back
The smooth jam master, don't put a big rock on
Part of see, which I wanna talk Jamaican
I land and deffen 'em up with no food like cherry sores
I banna mango and coconut some drink
Come on, now that sound trife it yah

I Got It Made (Up version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm your idol, the highest title, numero uno
I'm not a Puerto Rican, but I'm speakin' so that you know
And understand I got the gift of speech
And it's a blessin
So listen to the lesson I preach
I talk sense condensed into the form of a poem
Full of knowledge from my toes to the top of my dome
I'm kinda young--but my tongue speaks maturity
I'm not a child, I don't need nothin for security
I get paid when my record is played--to put it short
I got it made
I'm outspoken, my language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I play it cool--cuz coolin is all that I'm about
Just foolin wit tha girlies, yes I'm bustin it out
I'm Special Ed and you can tell by the style that I use
I'm creatively superior, yo--I never lose
I never lost cuz I'm the boss
I never will cuz I'm still
The champion, chief one, won't lose until--
I choose
Which I won't cuz I don't retreat
I'll run you over like a truck and leave you dead in the street
You're invitin me, a titan to a battle--why?
I don't need your respect cuz I--
Got it made
I'm talented, yes I'm gifted
Never boosted, never shoplifted
I got the cash, but money ain't nothin'
Make a million dollars every record that I cut and--
My name is Special Ed and I'm a super-duper star
Every other month I get a brand new car
Got twenty, that's plenty yet I still want more
Kinda fond of honda scooters--got seventy-four
I got the riches--to fulfill my needs
Got land in the sand of the West Indies
Even got a little island of my very own--
I gotta frog--a dog with a solid gold bone
An accountant to account the amount I spent
Gotta treaty with Tahiti cuz I own a percent
Got gear out wear--to everyday
Boutiques from France to the U.S.A
And I make all the money from the rhymes I invent
So it really doesn't matter--how much I spent, because, yo
I make fresh rhymes--daily
You burn me--really?
Think, just blink and I made--a million rhymes
Just imagine if you blinked-- a million times
Damn I'd be paid--
I got it made
I'm kinda spoiled, 'cause everything I want I got made
I wanted gear--got everything from cotton to suede
I wanted lead--I didn't beg I just got laid
My hair was growin too long, so I got me a fade
And when my dishes got dirty, I got Cascade
And when the weather was hot, I got a spot in the shade
I'm wise because I rise to the top of my grade
Wanted peace on Earth, so to God I prayed
Some kids across town thought I was afraid
They couldn't harm me, I got the army brigade
I'm not a trader, if what you got is greater I'll trade
But maybe later cuz my waiter made potato -n- alligator souflee--

Crazy,Revelations,1995,"(You must be crazy)

One day, let's just say that I was bored
I went for a ride in my new Accord
Sucker MC's were standin outside
Talkin bout, ""Yo Ed, let me get a ride""
I said, ""You're already ridin on mine""
He raised his tone, and out came the chrome from behind
(Better back up, nigga) ""Now continue with yourself
And don't step any further, cause it's bad for your health
And your wealth and your future
Cause I don't wanna have to shoot ya"" - (booya!)
And then I went into the store
I wanted some chips, it's a dollar for 4
I gotta get some juice and a loosey
I used to smoke, now it's only 1 or 2, see?
I'm not a bad guy, but I got bad habits
I was raised in the place where they grab it
If they want it (Brooklyn) but I'm not a thief
Plus I'm not a punk, so don't pop junk or beef
What?
You must be crazy
(You must be crazy)

I pay for the goods and I make my exit
I walked out the door, and I saw some legs, it
Looked like cheese that I knew
]From around the way or maybe from my brother Drew
It can't be the rest, because the others are older
Looked like a nice slice, tapped her on the shoulder
(Excuse me) She turned around, started to stare
Grabbed at my hat, said, ""Let me see your hair!""
I said, ""There won't be none of that, at least not here""
She said, ""My man is always snoring, and he's boring""
I said, ""So what? You're out here whoring?
What you think you're doing?
I ain't tryin to ruin no relationship
Honey dip, get a grip""
Cause that's the kinda fan I can't stand
When she wanna get wreck and still got a man
So if you got a girl, you better watch her
Because love is blind (got that ass) gotcha
(Think I'm crazy)
(You must be crazy)

Well now, I got around the way and I just couldn't wait
(Why?) Today mom said that she was cookin peppered steak
I parked the ride, and as I stride down the ave
I said, ""Oh my, what big thighs you have""
To a slice of cheese and cut-off shorts
She said, ""Ain't you Special Ed?,"" I said, ""But of course
But that's not the matter at hand
Do you have a man? Do you understand?
What I'm tryin to say is, well, ??? I'm a little shy
She said, ""Why, you're an attractive guy
Plus I seen your videos, all four of them
Can I be in one of them if you have more of them?""
I said, ""Yes, there's one next week
Come to the crib so we can speak""
She came over 3 days later
And I laid her

Think Twice,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You know what time it is kid
Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice
Step into your BI, GI
Thought you was a lot better, or atleast a little smarter
I beat you like your father, when he drunk
I see your eye shurnk, so what up punk
You wanna try me, this ain't a taste test
I'm already best, I never press
You a small thing when I'm walking
You get stepped on, as I slip on
My name is Ed Notbed so I'm never to be slept on
I got you sleepless, peep this, fuck that
And make 'em bleep this
It dont matter, you know my stee
Special Ed, Evil Dead, E.D
Anyway, my skills are never to be questioned
I shoot you down like a western, and make you chest burn
You smell death, you fell to your left
Now you stagger, you hold on but it don't matter

Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice
Open your brain to the rain
I'm lyrically trained to shame
So don't blame, yourself
It ain't your fault I shut you down like a vault
With a combination, laceration, brain station, malfunction
You wake up in a C-C day bed, sissy
You can't play Ed
No cartridge, style foul, like a partridge
In a bare tree, hear, see, feel, touch
You don't appeal much
No skill, you better chill, you funny like Bill
Telling me, what you telling me, really
I make fresh rhymes daily
Like Carvel or ?martel and sunset?
Bust some set, you wanna throw signs and can't flow rhymes
Many boast while I rock any coast
LA Times to the New York Post

Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice
I got so many styles that I've stopped countin'
While many wishin', any fish in, a fountain
Eastern, mountain, central, pacific
Or any other zone in specific, microphonelific
Heard you read about, whats Ed about
Dont doubt, I don't wanna have to spell it out
And if I let it out its gonna be a body
Lyrically, godly, while you hardly
Deserve to serve, what nerve
Human, assumin', you can ruin, what you doin?
Puttin' 2 n 2 n 2 n 2 together
I'd say you just got ate, hot plate comin' through
You ain't great enough to, get with the sick flu
Makin' you turn blue, like a Smurf
I blew Earth and I'm makin' you work
That's why you on my back like a shirt

Sucka MCs please think twice
I'm to nice kid I'm just to nice",https://genius.com/Special-ed-think-twice-lyrics
This Mic,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm about to open up this mic and fix it
Simplistic
Linguistic
Technician
Fusion
With fision in a vision
Like I'm in a television
Via satellite
You wanna battle, right?
Yeah, press the channel
Refer to your manual
You rhyme semi-annual
I make fresh rhymes... daily
Never did my school work
So they tried to fail me
Never told me nothing about Hailey
Selassie
Call me Special Ed
'Cause they don't see what I see
Ultra-
Violet
Flight pilot
Keep your wallet
Give me your dedication
Druggy with your medication
Have ya waitin'
Out in the rain
For a train and a bus
I was made from dust
Lazarus
Style: hazardous
Church Ave., straight from Erasmus
I'm deep like the sea floor
I'll make you see four
When there's one
You be stunned
Didn't see me come, but yeah, I'm right here
Up in your ear like q-tips or wax
Either which one, relax
And keep still
Peep skill
As I get deep like a drill
In a molar
I roll like a stroller
Sold a
Whole lotta records in my life
I hop flights to rock mics
While you frontin' for the cars
Or maybe for the chicks
I walk right through
And I'm steppin' on ya kicks
Right to the mic
Front and center
Don't nothin' enter
This area is restricted
Too much heat, you need liquid
Caution:
It's scorchin'
You don't wanna go there
I got it locked down... I did a show there
You don't wanna get me mad
I'll put you in a bag
And tie it
Like Wyatt
Earp
You'll get hurt
I'm much worse
I touch first
I don't scream and curse
I just breath deep
And I put you to sleep
Like hypnosis
Givin' you fatal doses
Rap ulcers
I rhyme aggressive
Get the message?
I bring forces
You can't stop
Like a pack of wild horses
Comin' back
To they extensions
I'm the kid everybody mentions
When you say: classic
When you say: lyric
Originality, performance and spirit
I don't wanna hear it
Bring it and I'll put it on you
And make you wear it
Where the stage?
Clear it
Anybody come near it
Let 'em come
And leave you shinin'
Red rum
And then some",https://genius.com/Special-ed-this-mic-lyrics
