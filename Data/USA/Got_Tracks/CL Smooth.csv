They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast, but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose you hope the little black boy grows
Huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood, there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not-thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married and a house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's rising a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this, so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the 
Portuguese Lover
 at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing, yelling ""Good God Almighty""
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way-back,
 so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes, in any weather
My Grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, 'nough respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-they-reminisce-over-you-troy-lyrics
The Creator,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capture
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator
Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this
(scratching)

Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator
It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator
C.L. Smooth, get busy",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-the-creator-lyrics
Take You There,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Never judge a book by the cover
Discover the soul brother with the Mecca don
Working brunette to blonde
How many Edison con when I respond in full black
With us having the vernon villains back-to-back
Amazing grace when I face the great paper chase
For real its long overdue
So I dont wanna talk to you
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted
Every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted
Im living through my son so daddy see it this way
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA
No doubt I'm with a piece, down in mecca, all crazy
To the late Eve, none of this is make-believe
I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century
Battle physically, conquer mentally
Essentially, youre dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go yknow, Ill take you there

C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

Control now so in the future see me calling the shots
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics
Im blowing up spots for knots in the millennium years
And now I drop it on my peers, brings tears and fears
And now the question manifest in my only
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue
That brings a world of intrigue and glamour to my arsenal
Of gods, pimps to players and layers of decepticons
My whole mind-state gravitate to weapon
Making people in the business get a misconception
It aint hard to the core, it aint sex on the beach
Its just another plateau the brothers have to reach
Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided
No question, youre dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, Ill take you there

C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away
Chose for negroes, the most hypnotical flows
On the planet, another East Coast track rose, goddammit
My theme, to mainstreams the knocker
Only time I get writer's block is when my lucci's on lock
Pretty much Im coming through in the clutch see
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel
Or is it just my style of hustle making a mark
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park
It was dark, when I brought it to the light, for spite
My staffs got me taking nothing but champagne baths
Now the aftermaths dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, Ill take you there

C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-take-you-there-lyrics
Searching,The Main Ingredient,1994,"You're everything that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, 
I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it


Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-searching-lyrics
Lots of Lovin,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Lots of lovin, lots of lovin

A sweet serenade, sip lemonade
As we laid inside the shade
My heart was captured when you possessed it
Carressed and blessed it, even suggested
You love me and I love you
And together, it would just be us two
I would protect ya, in your moment of fear
Relax, lover come here
And let's create this heavenly fantasy
When you lay next to me
I need you, and only you, to give me more
Tender love right down to the core
If you could read what's on my mind
You will find my feelings are genuine
Day after day, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Make love everyday, okay, produce
I ride through the tunnel of love, share a milkshake
Carve our name in a tree by the lake
Look in your eyes cause I miss you much
The way you say, ""I love you, C.L."" and your gentle touch
We reminisce with a french kiss
And out of all the girls, you're the first on my list
The only one now, and truly for life
My fiancée and future wife
Now you realize, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat

You want to be treated like a queen, stroked like a kitten
Every night you're the mitten I'm fittin'
Tease your lips with the tip of my tongue
And there's no doubt about it, lady, I'm strung
On your love, looks, and affection
You qualify, top choice selection
Woman of a darker breed
Mmm, cutie, you got what I need
Pour the champagne and toast the glass
Taste, but don't drink too fast
Cause we got many nights to cuddle by the fireplace
You blush when I touch your face
Now you realize you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat

Allah made you beautiful and youthful
So I feel giving you love is suitable
A walk by the beach, watch the sunset
Love is strong, like when we first met
Wake up in the morning, see your face
And I feel no one can take your place
Ever, so don't even think about it
I need your love and I can't live without it
Baby, you're the one I'm thinking of
From C.L. Smooth, with lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-lots-of-lovin-lyrics
Straighten It Out,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to...
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon...

Walk the fine chalk line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, 
more disciplined than a Shaolin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can't afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one two five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right y'all... straighten it out (say what?)
You got to... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... yeah
Straighten it out... it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, way to troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bassline's critical
Better than the original who first made it
Now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, see ya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true... straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
C'mon (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... you got to
Straighten it out... c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must... straighten it out
Say what?

Straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
The YG's, they must... straighten it out
The Hilltop, they must...straighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
Come on... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out (to close)",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-straighten-it-out-lyrics
For Petes Sake,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Here come's the rugged one, bust the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
'Cause I can do wonders undercover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow...blood clot
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah...
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon...
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
A dubplate to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Offspring of lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The klepto flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake
To my man...
Here come's the rugged one, bust the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
'Cause I can do wonders undercover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause I'm slick like Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Bust the way that I flow...blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake
To my man...
Music please...
(C.L.) The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe 'cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black pres can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a painter
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renegade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla
C.L. Smooth and Pete Rock
Could break and penetrate, piece of cake, cousin, for Pete's sake
To my man...
For Pete's Sake, c'mon...

Check it out and give me my 'spect
Check it out and give me my 'spect
Check it out and give me my 'spect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

Hit the lights and I appear beyond the stratosphere of Meccable function
And if you're pretty let your lady sleep in Carmel City
Begin and end the day on Lennon hunts for beachfronts
To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweets
SPLASH, and let me do my thing til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready
Cause All My Children got One Life to Live
But knockin wifey out the box is clearly a negative
I'm in rugged wears with fancy facial wears
And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce em in the house y'all

Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house

Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rugrats, sit back and watch a champion
It's time to wreck shop and show the world I'm true to hip-hop
So check the style and peace to niggas in the penile
Now umm, it's the original Funky Chicken tactic
I run game on your brain for the fame cause I'm active
You try to follow in my footsteps, you can't do it
I'm pullin your card it ain't hard, I don't have to prove it
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the utmost
From coast to coast, the music makes you overdose
You fiend, for the gangsta lean, I makes you scream
Rugged Bro Soul on the scene
A.k.a. the funk doer, numero uno, that means
Number one I get the job done plus I pack a gun
So run, and tell your peoples you'll be on the lookout
It's all about ""Who's in the House?"" with the funk

Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house

Money up steps the new era of my lyrical terror
Funkadelic for lightin up spots ever since little tots
When the dust settle I'm packin heavy metal plenty
The drop'll slaughter many, strictly off illegal entry
It's elementary Watson, I drive a Benz not a Datsun
Before my kicks hit the stage, we've been Foot Locking
Body rockin to keep the ladies flockin with a concoction
Rippin your blouse for no less than arrest in Morehouse
My teeth grits where my knife slits, we train em
And scar em like pits, off vibes of the Mecca joint
Vibe to position, never runnin out of ammunition
Now to the heart, I'm steppin with a concealed weapon
Nothing's calm when the bomb blaze you know the phrase
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth knockin nowadays
Eastside kid, you don't want none, so catch a relay
I'm lettin off on anybody tryin to steal my DJ

Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house

Carmel City,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Let me take you on a journey through Carmel City
Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honeys dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon y'all

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-carmel-city-lyrics
Return of the Mecca,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"To know the truth is to know the self
To know the self is to know the Mecca
Mecca's not a state of mind or a place
Mecca is a way of life
It is the answer to all confusion
The attribute
Adolpho, Abdullah, Mohammed
Makes way for the return of the Mecca
Salaam

Return of the Mecca

Be sure to explore the hardcore that came before Columbus
Discover no other serve the soul on a dish
Okay means official kid, not decrepit though
The lyrical dynamo set the flow when I do so
Entice the price with the mic device
Hit ya slice so precise that you never hurt twice
Fierce how I pierce when you near the frontier
A world premiere so put the armor on your gear
The overlord aboard with the two-edged sword
Adored and restored, now the young gun toward
Preserve the herb, never kick it to the curb
Vocalize a verb, and the return of the word
Mecca, the reincarnated selector
From the whole agenda, something to remember
A richer voice than Robin Leach
I'll reach with a speech, no bleach so you can't impeach
Monumentally smooth, I'll prove it sincerely
To barely when you're near me clearly never sound weary
Maintain the gravity, assault and battery
So sweet the repeat you're bound to catch a cavity
My ability to wreck a facility
C.L.'s potential, smooth and sequential
Deep in every measure, hit the lotto for the beggar
The midnight wrecker, return of the Mecca


Overstand the Mecca in command
Part of the plan is the man who built the land he began
A scripture ripped out the piece of a scroll
Better the know yes, a foretold, the beautiful and bold
Start em in Harlem with the motto, the Apollo
Boogie to me, I'll swallow hollow when you follow
Stable like a turntable, lyrics I cradle
No fable, label or run my tongue around your navel
You're coming to me so therefore the program's Mecca
The silhouette, a weirder fella, darker than vanilla
Talking about the theoretical, isometrical
Alphabetical rebel, a dissect-the-devil
Unveil a tale in detail, the third rail
Read it in braille, a bigger male leave a trail
Now I sink into the link, that'll make you think
You's too large to shrink, I need a drink
And toast to emperor, Mecca said to invent
To know of a child, worth your while so surrender
And never to be lobotomized, the flexin' of the stanza
But you know the answer when I drop a proper grammar
Tabasco, the Late Show, flow to make a peso
I manage to do damage so honey, get Macco
Risen from the prison, the division, Black and Decker
Strictly for your pleasure, return of the Mecca



OD off the black Baryshnikov
Taking it up north, back and forth, never been soft
Bound to see me swollen like a Beethoven
Listen wide open, never toking, do or die's my slogan
Save the sarcasm, I'll hit you like a orgasm
Back off of that and maybe later let you pat em
Necessary for any adversary to worry
The legendary, primary, never secondary
Dip in Peru, overdue in Honolulu
Now if you knew the preview, could bubble like shampoo
Outclass the mass so we'll look in the hourglass
No time to waste for those in contrast
Like the New York Philharmonic, sent to blow melodic
With the logic I hear like a narcotic
Put your best to rest, so get your bulletproof vest
I got the wild, wild west to your chest
You know the cause of death, so forget the autopsy
Another got sloppy so I lit it in poppy
Smooth as Peabo, with dough like Lillo
For the grand finale I slip on like a Bally
C.L. and P.R., categorizing we are
The soul brother, Mecca lover, funky by far
The classic fantastic, rip it like elastic
Here to get drastic, return of the Mecca",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-return-of-the-mecca-lyrics
I Got a Love,The Main Ingredient,1994,"What's going on baby?
Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds


You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, 
taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen


At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-i-got-a-love-lyrics
The Basement,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Ahh yeahh!! Feel the funk bay-beeee!!
That's right, this is called The Basement!
And my man CL Smooth kick it for you like this..

From the Heights, not what, am I right? Simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I'm your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hijackin' fella
So prepare for landin', and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stock
Now, all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my *errr!*
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon, I'm like a mink while you're soon to pimp a raccoon stall
Vocal arrangement, ready, set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave The Basement

The Basement, put the Funk in Grand
Here comes my man, my brother...
Grap Lover, get wreck cousin, c'mon

Call me the Grap Luva, yes, the younger Soul Brother
Keep your eyes on the prize 'cause you won't find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don't slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you're soon to discover
Yo, that's the kid from ""Mecca and the Soul Brother""
Yeah, once in a while I be with C.L. on the DL
Or I flow with Pete and find my placement in The Basement
The Basement, yes, where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace, I gotta go, Grapster's out the door of The Basement

Of the Basement!
Next we got... a special guest
I ain't gonna tell you who it is...
C'mon, rap along

Tick, tock, tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the Heavster and I know it makes ya sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas, I'm tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I'm never strapped
But I know a crew of Young Gunz that'll send you back
So easy does it on the DL
Peace to Pete Rock and the Mecca Don C.L
Heavy D's on this track, lettin' you know there's no replacement
Peace, signin' off, check one, two straight from The Basement

Straight from The Basement
I'm tellin' you now, kid, it's crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up?

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the Wig Out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin' upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the U.S. states, even London
Pastime present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a Dolphin, so call me Don Shula
A Raider well like Art Shell, crazy defense
A Pro Bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The Pimp Daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from The Basement

Uhhhhh, that's right, it's crazy funky
Aww my man
He's crazy funky, his name is Rob-O, c'mon baby

Alakazam, you'll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks like days
What kid said, ""Pete makes beats in The Basement""
Cool, hit the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I'd just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus Hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint's bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the sin
Yo I hear voices sayin', ""That's Rob Odindo in The Basement""

Ahh ha ha ha! Hah yeah! This is funky! I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is Deda, Baby Pa

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like Snoopy, the Beagle
People, grab a tight hold of yourselves
Pa snatchin' raw tapes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I'm comin' to town but you just can't wait
Check the station for conversation at six
Blah Uno here to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Diggin' up crazy shit like psychology
So, speak the peace, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in The Basement

In The Basement is where I dwell, sucka MC's fell
'Cause I am crazy funky
C.L. Smooth, my man Rahsaan, Rob-O, Deda Baby Pa
The Heavster, my brother Grap Luva
Everybody...*fades out*",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-the-basement-lyrics
I Get Physical,The Main Ingredient,1994,"It's going down from out of town
Off the wicked streets of New York trouble
Me and my man map the plan and make a hefty bundle
Blessing weight to listen to greats from the bassment gates
Making the dubplates that cause quakes in other states
My soldiers guzzle 40's with the shorties working the scenes
In tight jeans that blows all your boyfriends to smithereens
On a scout to get humped out from the zone, bumping Babyface
When everything's live, I let my Boo drive
Now do my hot shells ring bells and my knockouts settle beef
Any last requests? You better make it brief
Kid from 'Life Sucks' to 'Major Bucks' while Pete rocks
Control blocks from ballplayers to corner hustlers
Here come the Spark Brothers, many retire when I open fire
Dropping smooth synthetic, the physical's mental
But the outcome is energetic
Larger clientele, drops by the CL, the spiritual
To set it one time on the physical

I get physical, mystical, very artistical

You must be silly my soul is Bigger than Willie to shock a city
With some of the Mecca-fied joint at the boiling point
Making stable moves, wrestling grooves, here comes the pain
My style's invisible knives, slicing to the root of your brain
Funk locks when the terror come to box from the Pete Rizzocks
Knocks the ghetto blaster funking full fashion
Now dames kick the sham real slow, talking the shopping's urgent
There hasn't been that much scheming since Eve met the serpent
My love rules Daisy Duke's amused
Check the view of the issue my flexing bounce to your body tissue
You know the Iceberg Slim, dig it Daddy, let the click grows
Exotic to my foes, how I pimp these hoes
Don't be surprised, you get Tysonized, the ultimate test
Is like Sweet Pea spankin all of Chavez best
Blessed on a lyrical slugfest, cause every round's critical
One blow that kept the dough physical


You better brace yourself, in other words, fasten seatbelts
When the Carmel melts, you love spots in your poom poom shorts
No one can rock me and my latest aristocracy of Funktasia
I represent the full intent to bring the flavor
Head or gut, steady laying in the cut, fool it's mine kid
For niggas doin a master race Scarface bid
Maintain God, and keep it all solid
From the Overlord Adolpho Muhammad
To game written twenty years down the line still hitting
Making arena sites rougher than the hockey fights
It's just one of those nights, topsy turvy like a roller derby
Style is coming sturdy any way you wanna work me
Check the bizarre and hear a star, with so much
Chocolate over the Carmel, we need to own a candy bar
But before we merc, run the drill I get physical
Mystical, very artistical",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-i-get-physical-lyrics
All the Places,The Main Ingredient,1994,"""All the places and spaces I've been"" (Repeat 4x)

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
The places I drive? all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find yourself some toys, when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real, so feel 'em sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the king's revelation
Had heard me on the Run-DMC's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Everywhere this black man resides still
Check the monologue, I'm off for 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season, no reason we can't take it over

""All the places and spaces I've been"" ""Can you feel it?"" (Repeat 6x)

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged rated raw
Known to be the smooth who sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the pot stores and laundry mats
You love to gamble now we open up an after-hours spot
20 sacks with the Guinness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like Willie Mosconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the GS I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to Huguenot Street
Palled around the screen TV watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?


Travelling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missile I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and rubies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker fiends
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth's a household name",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-all-the-places-lyrics
Soul Brother #1,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"""He's a SWEET soul brother""
Here comes the (Soul x4)
(Soul x4)
Here comes the (Soul x4)
Here comes the (Soul x4)

Soul Brother #1
, here I come on the new tip
Nestle coated right, 'cause I'm rich thick and chocolate
Plug up any mic I'll bet you Pete Rock'll spark it
Huns always ask what's the bulge in my pocket
I tell 'em, ""Papes"", I rock them top to bottom
Never hesitate to say; (""Mmm I got 'em"")
I rest on the Hillside, over on the chill-side
Of town, so let's get down
Funky is the word describe this Brother on a Soul mission
Hookin' rugged joints, more Soul than the Soul Kitchen
C.L. does the scratch, so I won't leave you itchin'
White people even say, ""Pete Rock is bitchin'""
Harder than the hardest, odder than the oddest
I guess that's just because I'm smarter than the smartest
So back up, clear the path hon 'cause here I come
Soul Brother #1

I hit harder than a kick, quick to scoop a chick
When it comes to skinz, Pete Rock got it thick
I'm not your average, everyday, one-two to the beat
And don't stop, bust the shit I drop
New style for the 90's Pete Rock's a trendsetter
I'd just be lyin' if I said there's someone better
You can ask Greta, Greta with the red Jetta
Honey did me lovely and I'm glad that I met her
I come style after style, sucker MC's try to swallow
But them seem to say my style's too hard to follow
So just raise your hand and give praise to the #1
Soul Brother, who keeps the crowd in a daze
Pete Rock, and C.L. Smooth and if it ain't our groove
Then you might not move
Remember, 'cause there's no need to worry none
Yo, Soul Brother #1
* Pete Rock cuts and scratches *
Soul Brother #1

Nuff respect to my man Grand Puba
Nuff respect to my man Biz Markie
Nuff respect to my man C.L. Smooth
Nuff respect to EPMD
I'm like high octane
, with everything to gain
Those who try to step to this can catch pain
I keep a mag in the trunk of my Jag, in case some punk fag
Wants to catch one bag
Soul Brother #1, and I didn't come to riff
The finesse I possess will make the hardest unstiff
I'm full of motivation handle any situation
Hon said I'm so smooth they should call me lubrication
Mr. Splendor, a good back bender
Honeys always say, Pete love me tender
Call on Pete Rock, C.L. Smooth if you want the job done
Soul Brother #1
""He's a SWEET soul brother""",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-soul-brother-1-lyrics
Its on You,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Chorus (with EPMD samples):
On you (""Smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""Mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""When I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""Just in case... a brother acts a fool"")

It's death before dishonor, strap the vest down tight when you bring the drama
Now raise up off mine, and taste it in the raw
Before snipers on the floor galore, in my hardware store
Nightmares of thirsty crooks, niggas all acting fishy working off the books
Painting pictures of poverty, causing armed robbery
And if provoked, every last one gets smoked
No doubt for real it's like wildlife
Where thugs forever pull caps and always keep a knife
Cause on the strip, warfare's inevitable, hot steel's incredible
And if surprised, the revolution won't be televised
When I supply and demand, as I build my currency to expand, Call it progress when I bless my territory all respect due
But can niggas keep it real? It's on you
Chorus
Step into the dragon's lair, where CL's the don and Pete's the creator
Now praise the most high and represent the best
Cause the number one killer of black men is stress
The armed and dangerous, the bulletproof
Couldn't stop the homicide of another youth
Penetrating your body parts with hollow point shells, you fraud
Cause vengeance is mine said the Lord, indeed
My own click now turns greedy
Out of twelve of my soldiers, one will deceive me
With salt in the game, shame the family and push
My black ass straight into a terrifying ambush
The whole empire's at stake
Mastering the streets, devil the mental won't break and turn snake
For Pete's sake you gotta be true to the crew
So if niggas want to set it, it's on you
Chorus
Capture the beast within me, beware when it's moving deep in New York City
The diabolical gangster chronicle mob scenes in all directions
The type of connections to get your wig split
Submit the wanted signs posted, chickens spots for major knots you get toasted
To the head piece, I release firepower, only I'm controlling
We put in work and got the right brothers rolling
When hell kicks off we lick off
Keeping mine hard like stone from the red zone, to each his own
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
Hope my pockets hit empty and my Lexus crashed
But not in your wildest dreams
Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in Queens
The Vernonville's my capital, so memorize the cuts
Then give you two more seconds to get off these nuts, it's on you
Chorus
*song fades out and a freestyle session fades in*

Check it, Grap Luva, if you're in the house
Just get on the mic and show 'em what it's all about

It's all about the wicked check one two
Cause I rips a microphone and pass it to my crew
I don't drink no brew, I smoke nuff spliffs, I don't have no riffs
So check me as I shoot the gift
Rip rhymes, freestyle rhymes
Off top of the dome every time
I'm glad this shit is going on tape
So I can escape into the beat and make nuff papes
Word to God, kicking nuff freestyle rhymes

Ghettos of the Mind,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Ghetto of the Mind...
I catch a body at a party, sort of herbal with the verbal
Look above and see the vultures fly around in a circle
Baggin' while you're lollygaggin', raggin', tow-taggin'
Assassin with the millimeter roars of a dragon
Here stood the black hood, thirsty for the end
And for the love of money, kind of funny, new friends
Public housing, a thousand in a tent
So I'm forced to sell hell just to pay the rent
Killin' my own people, I put 'em out of order
Just like the liquor store scene on every corner
I'm tryin' but the kids keep cryin', and the bullets keep flyin'
Look, a boy, he's on the curb just dyin'
Finally the cops come dumb to the slum
Pull out a gun and arrest the wrong one
Wax all the Puerto Ricans and blacks
So they can never relax
I dwell, might as well learn the facts
Pete Rock and C.L. can radio a shack up
Sparkin' off and have 'em all callin' for backup
""Watch another crime and you're gonna do time""
All this you'll find in the ghettos of the mind
Ain't that somethin'?
Listen to cats and rough rats war under the window
When the ghetto forts flurry, never was a Tom and Jerry
Livin' ain't cheap, my survival is deep
In this part of town where the city never sleep
A Barney Miller roller, you can bet the car's stolen
Or static with your BM, only when you see them
Speakin' on your baby's mom, a best for the drama
Always tryin' to make a movie, little stark-ravin' looney
Stressin' it, but you know the ghetto keep ya busy
A place that when I die it would never even miss me
Crack phials in the aisles as one pimp smiles
Dope piles workin' hookers by the miles
But still my pop's got three jobs to stable
A family household and food on the table
So as we pray for all our souls to keep
Somebody's on the project roof, ready to leap
I want to stop the pain or the bad situation
But backwards wisdom I can't afford to give 'em
Self savior is much braver with the conscious behavior
Designed in the ghettos of the mind
Ain't that somethin'? Yeah, c'mon
It's like that y'all
I could never look forward to an early retirement
But still I maintain in a hostile environment
Hustlin' the concrete jungle for loot
My parents hated blood money so they gave me the boot
Take a risk cause the peer pressure has the edge
It was a blessin' when I saw my life dangle on the ledge
The streets coulda swallowed me whole
But the pain was all gone when I got to see my healthy son born
And now I bring him home to the ghetto
Only to make a stronger fellow
Maybe do some good for the neighborhood
It's hard playing hero livin' less than a zero
Raging Bull like DeNiro, the modern day pharoah
A concentration camp with the Section 8
Welfare checks given at a monthly rate
Apply for the get high, or just plain lazy
Many steady collect right around the fifth baby
The hawk is out but the niggas never pack it
A hundred dollar sneakers with the skimpy-ass jacket
When people are deaf, dumb, and blind they get left behind
Imagine in the ghettos of the mind",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-ghettos-of-the-mind-lyrics
Escape,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stock to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel
, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest for big lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the 
izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your bed frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's strife, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Heed the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name and that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism
Shedding some light just like a prism
You can't wait, you can't fake it, Escapism",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-escape-lyrics
Mecca and the Soul Brother,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"Okay, you wanna act trife and flip the script

Y to the o-u-n-g, another G-to the u-n-s
Let's back up, shortie, from the naughty like shorty
Berry Gordy with a forty gettin papes, oh Lordy
Claim you shoot more rounds than an Uzi
Stop the violence, 'cause ya can't do me
New York to L.A. say what I play
So catch a runaway smooth like a Billie Holiday
You couldn't bag me, boy, with a hefty
Train like Rocky but still can't step to me
So take a hint, money, leave it alone
And play like Stephanie Mills and find a 'Home'
Plus I never boogaloo with Yakub
We're mixed with the tricks in a alphabet stew
When I design a army I can reign
But never have more beef than Saddam Hussein
The night cap, so prepare for a cat scan
When I turn your brain into Moogoo Gai-Pan
Finger-lickin' the papes like there is no other

Mecca and the Soul Brother
(""Heavy D: Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth was on stage drinking Cisco"")

Schizophrenic, on a panic I do work
When you lurk with the professional ceremonial expert
The bold swinger
The Asiatic acrobatic lover won't sing the blues when I tap it
Save the mystery for Agatha Christie
Gimme a break, better wake Chief Kanisky
I'm not your ordinary modern day cliché
'Cause I'm here to save you little lost souls anyway
Go with the flow with the fleets when it executes
Any comp livin got buried in black suits
The limelight, never let it confuse you
It's a _Fantasy Island_ without a Tattoo
The hardcore few tend to look for
'Cause troop can't buy a knuckle game in a store
Making movies like your name is Faye Dunaway
Then hear the rumor echo in the project's hallway
You want a fast break, me no static
But Mister Whipple can't dribble like Magic
I yolk em up in domination, nerds got scrambled
The Tony Randall left in shambles
Finger-lickin' the papes like there is no other
Mecca and the Soul Brother

Let me see..
Pete Rock is like salad dressing when I toss another lesson
Ready or Not, prime time After 7
I pull women like a wisdom tooth
Without any conversation with Doctor Ruth
Making island girls wind with the glamity
'When Doves Cry', Apollonia and Vanity
Picture the Mary Jane frame on a mantle
Consider me a vandal the Virgin can't handle
And never clown downtown with Pat Sajak
Popping that yang riffin ""Homie don't play dat""
So don't gas the kid to make a movie
While I'm smackin a booty who just love to rock a doobie
Even though I make petty cash like a beggar
With no stash, I make a Air bet and knit a sweater
So the night cap of rappin', no slackin', backin'
Hand clappin', feet tappin' Chief and Captain
Could finger-lick the papes like there is no other

On and On,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"I am the one they call the G the R the A the P and
I didn't write this it's come off the top of the dome
So what'cha wanna do, and what'cha wanna go home
And tell, ya mama
That I'm one with all the mad drama
Yes I was causing, the movies on 125th St
I crossed over honey dip knew it was Harlem Week
I was going on the place to be
It's me, the capital rapital G-R-A-P
In the place to be with my man Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Gots to bust the groove as the people begin to move
And get on the dance floor
Got to move the funky stinkin' little whores
And all the hoods, and all the punks, and all the suckers
What the fuck I got stupid motherfuckers
On my dick
What the fuck I rock the mic so quick
With Adolfo, in the place to be
And my man Ras is right in back of me
Rob-O good to go, I got to f-l-o-w and that spells flow
With Chris Champ, and what's up I'm bout to get amped
On top of the mic, and I'ma set an exam-ple
Girls I pull, I got the honey dips so what's up my tank is full
Of sperm, I'm ready to bust a nut
What's up Pete Rock come get on the cut
Rock to beat, get wreck on the regular
Listen to me because I cause mass hysteria
Peace!!

The nightcap was exiled, steadily profiled
As the underachievin non-believin can't stand to reason
Where's your daddy boy - to categorize the drinker
Misunderstood to make the ordeal linger
They label me a problem child who can't cope
Hangin by a thread, yes a very thin rope
Inevitably, can never be the man can I tell ya
Visualize and memorize him in a cellar
Well tally-ho, pip-pip, my fam's gonna catch a fit
My father lookin like he wanna bust my lip
But that was never good for my health
So I take the shovel out my pocket and dig myself
Now when I look at the man in the mirror
I see things much more clearer my Lord
I'm not that popular, less than a dollar
But the pengo I pack can make you holla
* Pete Rock scratches various ""on and on"" samples *

I said, what you don't know could make a whole new world
Man, listen! I'm set to sabotage premonition
Your propaganda, crooked type of version
Some of the things I bring, you're babblin non-person
Imbedded in my character, rebel nostalgia
Uncommon valor who'd rather
Have no man-made religion or sect
But try to believe what you conceive may be half correct
I shed light, to show the path in sight
'Cause a man who can't treat you right can't teach you right
In front of your eyes, what a surprise, and let the nature rise
Just for the girls and the guys
A Phi-Slamma-Jamma when you wear a bandanna
Peace to Pop Dukes, and long live Nana
The formula's reality, Pete Rock's the storm
Together, forever, yes G we got it goin on
* Pete Rock scratches various ""on and on"" samples *

Internal affairs, flippin Hollywood Squares
In search of the Mecca many travel in pairs
Off the slave ship to Sodom and Gomorrah
To support a short order when I freak it on a corner
5-0 cruisin, decide to pull you over
Beefin, ""Where's the Coke?"" I said, ""A six-pack of soda?""
The rookie's lookin thirsty, but everything's mental
A baseball bat, to smack Shirley in the Temple
Agreed to meet the maker so I yelled Hail Mary's
And flew that head, to hit The House on the Prairie
But the past can never choose my future correctly
I found a greater source directly
On and on, keep it on, you chant the
Boppin simonized, pullin you clockwise jammie
To quickly skip the minimal tip, I dap for the wise I dip
Can anyone see, phenomenally, to the last degree?
I capitalize subliminally, wreck for positivity
Yes my little chickadee, ready to flow with me
Nevertheless I bless, follow me and see
Predominantly, CL'll be, All in the Family
God bless Marky Black, know we go way back
The lyrics I pack is like a needle in the haystack
CL and Pete Rock, smooth like Dom Perignon
Never torn, word is bond, we got it goin on

Anger in the Nation,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"""You know, nowadays it...seems like there's a lot of...

South Africa, what does it mean?
To burst the scene, or conquer like a philistine
War or peace, which one do you prefer?
Pass me my M-16 for the disaster
A reason for the treason in a jet black season
For peace, justice, and freedom
For the Original Man, architect of the Motherland
Kings to Queens is the Asiatic Black plan
Pre-Adamite, first to see the light
Way before Adam and Eve took flight
Bless the seed of Abraham, I came to jam
Protest the teachings of another man
Uncle Tom stay loyal so they boil
I'm the alchemist with the twist from the true soil
My blood brother Adolpho on the side of me
My vision ain't blurry, so don't even lie to me
The rebirth, the revival of our culture survival
To elevate, the black man is vital
You gotta realize now what we're facing
The floors I'm pacing from the anger in the nation

Here's the situation from a darker view
Night and day, salt and pepper in the earthly stew
But the salt think it taste better, straight up superior
Therefore, the flavor of the pepper's inferior
Incorrect though, giving some heartburn
Level of a devil better wait your turn
And here is one recollection of imperfection
No one should be judged by complexion
Library, broken down as lies buried
To force their beliefs to pilgrims all hurried
Television, tell-a-lie-vision
A schism, negative realism
Four-hundred-and-thirty-five years til weak
Mental deaf dumb and blindness put us to sleep
Out of the dark comes light so the first can't be White
So Armaggedeon comes like a thief in the night
Rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
Some won't survive the next confrontation
And I'm aware of segregation
Pump your black fist for the anger in the nation
""Let's get together!"" * cut n scratch 2X *
""Let's get together...and raise""
""Let's get together!"" * cut n scratch 2X *

Some walk slow, 'cause the water's not shallow
Let my people go, you little Pharoah
Listen how they word it, be observant
Then: house negro, today: civil servant
I want to drop the bomb but remain calm
Strong like the power of the Fruits of Islam
Black is beautiful, hot like fire
Guess how many times they thought they killed the Messiah
Malcolm X, Dr. King, let's sing
All around the world let freedom ring
Reality is real, so how do you feel
From being kings on a throne to picking cotton in a field?
Your slavery is lack of identity
One of the things that's not making you a friend of me
What's your cause, aim, rationale?
'Cause I made up my mind, I never scrape or bow
But teach my own, the sound of black unity
Together we can rise and now's the opportunity
The Tuskegee Experiment, indeed it was big
When they used the black man as a guinea pig
Animalism, pumped on a lower level
But can only be the works of the devil
And I'm telling you now the frustration
The future's facing from the anger in the nation

Act Like You Know,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigga, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tutor up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know

C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Pete to my beat is a rock like concrete
Hard for the street, the cipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Warm like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita, Pete or I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-act-like-you-know-lyrics
Skinz,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Uhh
Ahh yeah
What we talkin' bout? Talkin' 'bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

I hear it callin' never stallin' hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it's loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca wanna bang bang
Beggin' a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thing
CL, kickin' flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin' on the wins, I'm about to hit the skinz

Talkin 'bout the skinz
The skinz
That's right, talkin' bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin' bout an everyday thing
C'mon

Nowadays I'm on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
'Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)'ll kill you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziploc
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it's hard like Charles Bronson
It's kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world of a 
big batty girl
Won't 
hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
'Cause when I jump into my thing I make the bed spring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who's the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she'll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won't be the Post
After that you know the flavor I'm ghost!

That's right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz
C'mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they're forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
But never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won't curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
Sleepin' with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I'm with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damn it) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
'Cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin' like thunder
'Til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I'm out

Like the Isley's, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it's OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin' all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin'
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

How I hit the skinz, uhh
It's fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don't try to show
Because I'm, the accurate man
Everybody knows it
Peace to all stealers

New Rochelle, the Bronx...",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-skinz-lyrics

The protege could play like chess to quest the best
Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but 
A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the Fahrenheit, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad-libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullet hole in Mars

In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rough like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a savior
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
'Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar-pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin

CL's here to get wreck for the year

Comin atcha now you listen at the feet of a master
Caution, not Wheel of Fortune, here's a portion
Of untamedness, approachin famous, for miscellaneous
The track get crackin though, unexplainable
When I ground a jewel, sound is simply uncontainable
Release my soul, but never make the mistake
And play me like a stone cold fruitcake man
Cause you can never fathom G the dough we want so
My flow's the steadiest, to never leave us penniless
Come on down to the very necessary legendary
Well the more the merry stickin women type of villian
The evidence relentless, I ride to see you magnatized

Put all the wackest rappers on a boat and let it sink
Don't blink; next thing you see you spot is taken
No Jax I'm Fakin' soldiers took the whole reservation
On a scale of one to ten, we move rather swiftly
Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty
Don't blow mine, your trump card is exposed to pages
Now your beginning's already at the final stages
Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast
I never saw people run so fast, aight?
Stay up all night, then sleep all day
Makin big Lucci and would have it no other way
In conjunction, with the function, as stated
Orchestrated by the Soul Brother nickel plated
Tell the judge you were foolish, and try to be lenient
Cause you never had the The Main Ingredient

This cap is peeled layin joints like a minefield

Cant Front on Me,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Ah, yeah, yes
Psychedelic
Uh, come on
This is what I like
It's that Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth stuff
Uh huh, yeah
Brothers can't understand
You know I'm about to drop a funky beat on you
Like this...
Hit the war drums that vibrate the earth underneath
Here my people and I come, gotta wake up the chief
Not a pale frail ghost, C.L.'ll wreck the most
'Cause the Mecca land never had a Leo Africanos
The Sudanian, master of the Mediterranean
And if it's lovely I'm the one you're Skypagin'
Lower than the Mole Man, R&B, you're silly
The only male hardcore cruisin' through my city
Rise to the supernova, swami like Bola
Heavy hitter I consider Uecker leanin' on my shoulder
Measure like a yardstick, thick at arithmetic
You add it up and I roast a high pick flick
Hit the pitch and then I'm gone as the funk lingers on
I don't publicize here to keep the black race torn
But steady at an altitude where you get the mental food
Not to be rude, here's a fresh pot brewed
Oh, what a web we weave when we practice to deceive
Sparkin' off a trick up the sleeve
Pete stocked the bedrock, listen and you'll see
And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me
Yo, you can't front
It's like that, c'mon, yeah
Yes, you know I got to talk
You can't front
I'm tellin' you now
C.L. Smooth and the Rock, c'mon
Many consumed what was locked in a tomb
That I gradually groomed, coming out now smelling like perfume
So take a whiff when I wrap a gift, play ya like a gospel
A logical apostle, colossal (whoooweee!)
Afro, a cut me like a fade with a Braun
Sport a bald head, but never needed Hair Club for Men
Drop a SCUD, fully-capable, a form in a eclipse
Skips to backflips soon as it leaves my lips
Suave, no I can make the funk turn to habit
Get the old 45 and I get busy on static
Welcome to the Ramadan, pilgrimage to Mecca Don
A prayer for the pair, 
Shukran, Afwan!
'Cause ain't no misbehavin' when they manage what you're cravin'
Put the ""Anger in the Nation"" on your station
Anvils that fills the whole circumference
And black people crowd in a mass abundance
To hear Gabriel's horn, blow it like a Naiji
What's the flavor unit with the top priority?
C.L., untouchable with the clip full
Impossibly, the posse can't front on me
Don't you dare front
Don't you dare front
Not on me
'Cause I'm the man
C.L.'s the rhymer
Right on time
Right on, my brother
Come on, kick another verse for me
You desire the messiah for the entire empire
Total organizer of the earth, wind, and fire
C.L. and Pete Rock unlock the hard rock
Many want to mock and the honey-dips clock
Intercontinental for the residential
Never coincidental, 
rough on a rental
Count all the bars numeric
Pro-prosthetic if ya let it resurrect the nongeneric
The brother on the cover, yes, a rapper not a singer
If you recognize him, point with your index finger
Shock another flock when I hit the block
God or Devil on the set that's level, labeled as a rebel
In retrospect I detect those incorrect
And reflect the black power project
Supreme 'cause I chose to never blaspheme
Going to the extreme, place it on a very high beam
And drop jewels for five thousand fools who stampede
'Cause the proper show stopper's what ya need
So come and get a taste of the dynamic duo
And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me (Yoooo!)
You can't front, boy
'Cause we're the skilled fools (skibooze?)

In the Flesh,The Main Ingredient,1994,"The original, check me out on the track
Dead smack in the middle of something that's phat
The opposite of wack because I don't go there
I prepare a little something on paper for your ear
To hear, to press rewind one time
Listen to the beat and the extremely dope rhyme
This individual has, nothing to prove
As the groove gets thrashed in the flesh

""In the flesh""

Introducing funk from the yard, collecting strictly knockouts
The brothers I sparred, which only means the man got nothing to prove
On a power move made by the CL Smooth
Live for the '95 I arrive in person
Hard dialogue without a whole bunch of cursing
It's my prerogative, so back up and live, fool
As long as they don't violate everything's cool, cause it's all good
Understood is the smoothest daddy with the roughest raps
Am I thinking about blowing the spot? Perhaps
Carry straps on strips for the trigger-happy pirates
Where ladies catch fits steady reaching for my privates
But hold, how I unfold my whole repertoire
Now here we are to whole making of a superstar
With Rob-O and Dedi with the P.R
But nevertheless it's CL Smooth
""In the flesh"" (scratched 4x)

Rob-O's at the top of the list, so bust this
Stick to funk like Scotch, the top-notch vocalist
You don't stop, cause I can illustrate with the needle
Penetrating straight through the souls of many people
Is there any equal? On this path I'm innovating
Still faking, put down your pads and stop waiting
See the year of the fly MC is here
So stand clear, I'm facing the Gods with no fear
Rob-O, East Coast, uptown
MCing the most and spreading Mecca all around
Selecting the sound to make the party people hound
The DJ for more of what I say in '94
It's like that, so don't stop
It's like this, so God bless
Soul Brothers get down with no stress
Yeah INI's representing in the flesh
""In the flesh"" (scratched 4x)

Even in the mirror, it just doesn't get any clearer
I hear a funky beat and I gotta get nearer
KABOOM! Stepping in the sound room mellow
A dangerous flavorous fellow, hello
Style and grace, the original's in this piece
In the place right along with the pace
Nevertheless, in the flesh no quest'
The sess in the system, of course I'm fresh
I rest in the Villes, the skills advance
To a level of extravagance, the talent's all balanced
The extreme dopeness for the nation
D. is the inital, MC's the occupation
5'9's the height, light the color of the skin
Once the beat roll, my goal is to win
My friend the best, the real side yes
I rest my case in your face in the flesh
""In the flesh"" (scratched 4x)

Soul Brother supreme to catch wreck in the flesh
So check one two and a mic test
Now clear the room, I scoped you with the wide angle zoom
Trying to overstand my funk tunes
Coming soon, so chill, don't stress The Creator
I'll kick the funk loop from here to Cal Tjader
And cross the fader, and pack the lines on my paper
With rhymes so tough, who got the flavor?
Plus the knack to rock, I'm steady heating up the spot
The Chocolate Boy Wonder making heads bop
In flow motion, domes crack open like the pavement
Off some shit I made down in the basement
The funk ambassador, asking you to get with the pro-
Fessional, yo there's no question I can flow
Time to slide, you know the P.R. will provide
The real and still I feel the vibe, I'm in the flesh

Sun Wont Come Out,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Open Sesame, stepping through the mist, it's the specialist
Coming to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standing in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering
Now appearing, Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out

Check it out, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You know we can't Reminisce
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street a beat
To keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like Boomer, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'mma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over Noriega's Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about
The Sun Won't Come Out

Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You can't Reminisce to T.R.O.Y
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

I woo chicks off acoustics, watchin the Knicks
We up ten, we need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, and what I invent
A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days (so check it out)
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
From the basement, enterin the streets you meet
Pete Rock and CL Smooth and when you see what it's about
You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades

Yo, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
We can't Reminisce
Yo, if we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Ghettoes of the Mind
If you know what I'm talking about
You know The Sun Won't Come Out, so check it

One in a Million,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1993," (x4)
One in a million - fluke for you baby
One in a million - listen it drives you wild

I'm one in a mil and from the Vernonville
I work it out and wait to get curled
I'm here to sell more joints than ""We Are the World""
Flows and old bros and new foes are open and closed shows
So never doze attention, the Mecca's representing
The uptown jazz sound and the chicks start mingling
Now let's watch a flick by John Singleton
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth is in the Mecca house building
Cause this funk is one in a million
 (x3)

Poetic, energetic rhymes that I'm droppin on ya
Justice, must this be hotter than a sauna
You know the boy wonder Mecca Don's got the soul
The black brother's in control now it's time to roll
We kick the flavor neighbor rappers when you need a savior
We're the two man band that everybody favors
Check the resume as we sit back and parlay
I'm on the job like the mob every single say
'93 no shorts, music is my sport
The hot metal's on my waste, brother here's a taste
In your face, the bass chillin like a masked villain
Nobody better cause we one in a million
 (x4)

You know the bump jump can damage your rump and dump ??? in a lump
And leap higher than a Reebok Pump
My funk style, wicked and wild and me you dial smooth as New Now
Many call this my Poetic Justice
So my fist can dismiss your hit list here's another twist
Listen in fact I brought my cheek's kiss
Roots and our loots and Tim boots the funk is ???
Now my sound brings new recruits, hey!
Mecca raw the more I toured to get my first born
It's a boy, now my name lives on and on
Whip a jam, fully aware that I can scare a cocky new pair
Slide em and guide em to the rocking chair
Up and away I'm trying to play the classics to today
Hip-hop nonstop, collecting ghetto props
Drilling grilling holes I feel because we're here to make a killing
Cause this funk is one in a million

Tell Me,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two


A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em


The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-tell-me-lyrics
Good Life,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"Some live the good life loungin' by the pool
Catching a suntan and everything's cool
Male or female, you want to be set
In the big mansion drinking Moet
You read the Wall Street Journal
Later for the comic
Far from dumb because you practice logic
You lived poor in the ghetto
Never had the money easily
But, you found the remedy
So, you, your girl, and your kids can have a better opportunity
And teach them all about unity
Cuiltivate in the brains the word of Allah the master
And they go far
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground
Indeed to help another that's down
A tough situation cuts like a knife
In search of the good life

From the church, the home, on down to the prison
People want to know how is he and she living
Does he work?
Do you wonder if his life will bloom?
Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon?
How's the mother?
Do they ever go visit the brother?
What about the dad?
I heard he drinks undercover
Some are still shooting up, another on crack
Just the other day trooper got sent back
What type of life do you lead?
Tell me
Cause you can be anything you want to be
Some will strive for the good life in any case
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color
Hear me now, brother
All around the world the husband and wife
Work night and day in search of the good life

The G double O-D L-I-F-E
Living in luxury
Care free
Period
No time to waste
We catch ours all day
We work instead of play
I B-U-I-L-D inside me
Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city
From a paranoid mental delusion
Plain and simple
I won't cause confusion
Yo, that's your fault
Stop the somersault
Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt
My destiny I define is heavenly
So, Fort Knox, open sesame
Light shines and the birds keep singing
As I still cling to my positive upbringing
With the need to succeed, right?
On a natural high

Get on the Mic,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Capture this funakthon loaded by the Mecca Don
Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cars and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarcerate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Vernonville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I...
Ladies and gents for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Colosseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing love
And tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with Toni Braxton
On your TV is me, incredible MC, B
With the P to the R, my break a ways can bounce for days
This fillets, I'm trucking jewels like Eric B
And all you corny fools can't see me, oh my my my
Healthy, wealthy, and wise just your size
Come and try the hardcore, set on down by every law
Moving in your Lex treks out a sextivity
At its highest level of funktagious served in major
He's the real neighbor, overqualified to be luchified
Pete Rock's the god when my stiz-ile profile
Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can fade me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30
Power's what I cherish, all informers must perish
On the downlow, lift my peoples from the ghetto
In every bourough CL is quite thourough
In do or die don't try when INI",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-get-on-the-mic-lyrics
Go With the Flow,All Souled Out,1991,"(Get on up)

Yo', from the intro, I flow
Three in a row, buildin' like a Lego
Stacks upon stacks it attacks the wax
Scrub it like Ajax, relievin as a X-Lax
The night cap of rap here to make another hit
To undercover, smother, word to mother
Pump it for the playground, world renowned
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth is in town
I design a logical line a mastermind
So recline and listen to what's mine
I'm untouchable, lovable
Some try to imitate, but you can't make a double of
Me, the capital C, capital L, capital S
M-double o-t-h, yes
A pro, so you know
You gotta go with the flow

Smooth as ya ever gonna get to hear
Crisp and clear, so step to the rear
And make room for daddy, bigger than a Caddy
To move a crowd? Hm, gladly
It's all done with ease, past MC's
And all they feel is a breeze
The technician with the first division
Like a surgical incision, deeper envision
My flow the naked eye can't stare
But only hear another poet like Shakespeare
C.L. the swinger, ringer, clinger
And oh yes, you know, another hum dinger
Wreckin any studio, love to make cash
So kick it like judo, big like a sumo
Rhymes like a pro, so you know
Like a flute I blow, and go with the flow

I rock the microphone but you probably know
To hype the show I gotta go with the flow
And take it to another degree that many people wanna see
But above elementary
I made lyrical, any kind of material
More than minimal, for any individual
That I send, to reach the end
And just like Clark Gable, it's 'gone with the wind'
And take flight, through the night
Like a meteor, right insight to shine like a bright light
You gotta tip-toe from the get-go
Live in stereo, rhymes gotta flip, so
Pete Rock can move your butt and cut the strut

Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell

Not Lou Pinella cuz I'm black and mo' betta
Bust a phenomenum, we come to get busy
Deep in roots, but my name ain't Kizzie
Many many march cuz I'm heavy on the starch
Never tell a farce when I scale on a arch
Jammin' on the radio, brothers say, ""way to go""

Bigger than modern technology

C.L. is the attribute you salute
Cuz I gotta make loot, can't afford to be cute
Enter the equilibrium in a medium
Breaking your cranium with no ultimatum
Drop a psalm like a bomb, never land in your palm
And now I'm so cool and calm
Pure unadulterated, premeditated
Lyrical form, Pete Rock is the storm
Sophistication I kick to a nation
I rare compilation I call recreation
The prognosis, so mackadocious
Straight up ferocious for those who can focus
Large like the Beatles, ask all my peoples
Never make movies, so don't talk sequels
So, hon, save the chit-chat when I kick a format fat (it's fat)
It's like that...

I'm all sold out, no doubt, without a question
The blessing your guests in a suprucated session
Anyway your honor, heresay the melee
Is here for the payday, so A to the K
Or should I say Dedi, Original Baby Pa
Smooth like a reservoir, the funky Shang-Ri-La
No shame in my game, I'm set to entertain
And if it wasn't for the fame, skinz would never know my name
So back off a tad bit, that's a bad habit
Cuz I write the raw...for sure
Now I'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile
Never fragile cuz I'm flowin' like the Nile
Swing a jewel or a gem, notice how I say them
With my approach, smoke a rhyme to a roach
A four-season lover, light-skinned and bigger
But what I deliver come before the cotton picker
So here's to another hit, perfectly legitimate
When I hit the skinz, guaranteed to keep the candle lit
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat

""So bring it down""
And the Soul Brother #1
""So bring it down""
Job is done with the YG'z Menace II Society
""So bring it down""
Feel the real steel, the hot metal
""So bring it down""
""So bring it down""

It's the kill or be killed, rugged skill, that's often
And land your fucking asses in a coffin, what
You see cold steel, cause niggas wanna mill'
Like Shaquille, O' Neal
Bullets are real, cock it back and then I peel off
Fuck the kamikaze Mecca is on the shotty hottie
The cops are running white chalk around your dead body
Abandon ship, niggas are ready to flip and bag a punk
They can't fight next night, twist a lism by your grave sight

Over, yes you over, six feet under
You sleep, I'm outta these, you're deceased
A reason for the treason, hunting season
Not for rabbit
I deals for niggas drinking beers lounging off block
Till the early morn', word is bond, another brother gone
Caught up in bullshit, quick talking with nines and banana clips
Vermilion with bloodshed, the color red, two to the fucking head
Man you're dead, Death Becomes You

""So listen"" - Slick Rick
""So bring it down""

Infrareds locked on ya heads here come the feds
Freeze now when I squeeze hot metal breeze
Right through your arteries to bring you to your knees
I think he's dying black
I got the track to send you silly ass niggas back
Snatch ya ho stab ya pimp and watch him limp away
I fiend Luchi till I'm fucked up old and gray
Hey dog I send you to the morgue
I'm from the Vernon ville blood spills shells drop
Because I gotta kill

When ya heard it go pop-pop
My Glock hit a nigga's knot
Cause I'm one of the hard akh's smokin' motherfuckers like crack rocks huh
So back up, be ghost when I keep my toast Murder She Wrote yo
Fully equipped with this death blow, flippin'
Because I'm on the level like the rebel crazy bodies and tombstones
Straight to the devil, nigga lay in ya bedspread
Because ya through from evil that men do
Shifty nigga Death Becomes You

""So listen""
""So bring it down""
""So listen to what we say because this type o' shit it happens everyday""

No resurrection with protection slay cut up in the blender
Just like Mohammed blowin' up the World Trade Center
The hellraisin' burner blazin' stressin' major caution
See the Mecca Don showing a tongue like Jordan
Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now you punks are pickin' lead out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches

Buck-buck-buck-buck rat-tat-tat I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfucking trigger
I'm sick in the head I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God I'm coming straight from the penal
I'm Menace like Dennis so don't try to play me close
I wave my gun in the air yo I don't fuckin' care

Worldwide,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Who keeps it methods unorthodox, who caught the props
Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price
I'm mathematically precise, smooth and plus nice
With a flow that's like a mailman or letter carrier
Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Straight down, I don't fake I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
That INI's in the house (You don't stop)
With Grap Luva, Marco Polo, Ras you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject it?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide
Soul Brother and I'm going worldwide

Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, is to religion
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, yeah to God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I played your shit out, now get out, cause my wig out has to hit
Steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest
So I suggest if you're in the way step aside
Cause Pete Rock is coming worldwide",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-worldwide-lyrics
All Souled Out,All Souled Out,1991,"Here we go
One time to the head
Somethin like this

Make way for the C.L. wrath on phonograph
Knowin the half, cozy like a bubblebath
Never said to be strange when I break and rearrange
A weak sap that's small as chump change
In the Poconos playin dominos
Foes who rose caught a broken nose
'Who's the Boss?' Not Tony Danza
Apart so Lorne Greene on 'Bonanza'
'Unforgettable' as Nat King Cole
Rough like a rodeo, hangin like a scarecrow
I get busynism, pump the realism
And just for the teacher or tutor I quiz em
Bonafied to eat you like Frito Lays
You can't faze and roll like the craze
Cultivate the mind, train it to teach
To write a book like Edward ??Shaw Keats??
Motivate the crowd aloud to get a response
Catch the mood of ambiance
No Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey
???, played like a damn ukulele
Ahead of the class, so I break ya like glass
Have ya open like a surgery bypass
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out

Yeah (8X)

C.L.'ll get wreck in a millimeter sec
Kirk out, all hands on deck
Pick up the pen again, perp like ??Sanchor??
We're goin Warp Speed, raise the anchor
Rock a party so fly it's a sin
You bang on the door but you can't come in
So get a ???? like ??Rolo?? tomorrow
And if he turn snake just cut him like an avocado
Share the bread and wine like the Passover
Better luck than a four-leaf clover
C.L. Smooth'll kick a groove to a nation
Start from Genesis, end at Revelations
The tune immune and tap the fannies
Of Miss America and pick flavor panties
The man no type of woman avoids
Grab a microphone, blow it up like steroids
Enticin like lingerie
Had to lay Connie May just the other day
Explore like Magellan, shake like a gelatine
Can't be a felon, more seeds than a watermelon
When I raise like cattle for the battle
C.L. is prime time, go buy a raffle
A ticket when I kick it, clever like an ????
Masses and classes crisp and clear
I rock em, sock em robot
Pete Rock around the clock catchin wreck on the block
Playin more vocals than a Milli Vanilli
Shoot the gift with a spliff, but cousin, pass the philly
And let me get Brand Nubian, cold shake your booty and
Large like a ?????
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out

Smooth like Fabian, hot as the Arabian
Some will try but can't solve the equation
Take em down to the city where the boys act illy
And the girls look pretty like a philly
Rock the nurses, a quick couple of verses
No one curses, a king being the merciless
Read the resume first and I bet em
Paralyzin, hard to trace like venom
????? diluted ????? strictly be chillin
To play a better show on screen than Jack Nicholson
Ed Lovett International cuts my hair
A pioneer run fear here to Delaware
I got a 'Monie in the middle' for a playmate
A Spinderella/Salt-n-Pepa lover that's great
The unchained melody, sing it like Sarah Vaughn
Your ass is grass cause I can mow the lawn
Not a tricky-dickey lover that's picky
But hard nitty-gritty when things get sticky
I wanna hold a hump back like a whale
But you're frail and don't weigh much on a scale
The Tango & Cash, dynamic duo
Figure the one done so you know
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-all-souled-out-lyrics

The chef in one breath laid a dance of death
On a grill pursuin and barbecuin and groovin in skill
(WHOO!) Holla when I snatch em by the collar
See em starvin like Somalia
While you trickin stickin chicks up in the booty parlor
(Whoah) A lot of funk to make you say, ""Aow, C.L. how?""
Cause all I know is listen, can I get mines now? (Say what?)
In my verse brain cells burst so beep the nurse
For the knowledge cause the worst niggas talk garbage
A mean machine, to light it like kerosene
My cuisine is how David killed the freakin Philistines (uh-huh..)
Begin to sin, with the devilish grin
So me and my kin, can win and break bread when the record spin
(Yeah..) My love is real Ock, a lyrical buildin block
With incredible settable pure funk of Pete Rock (woo-WHOO!)
Forget the soup of the day, cause niggas are gassin
Well styles I broke smooth lotion down the ashy as hell
Got a rhyme so chunky it's amazin G
I make you think the Fat Boys are back on crazy (YEAH)
Major Mecca's in Asia when I date her
Some old flavor by the sun moon and stars and over the equator
Universally thirstin me to show no mercy

I double em up and shuffle em down, combinate, stick n move around
Til you work me up an appetite to fight
Like a nick in the paint, think it is when it ain't
With no more restraint I make a frail opponent faint (OH!)
You need to get your ears glued to soul food
That makes you boogie til your nude and you never get rescued
(OW!) Now waiter take an order simply nothin shorter
Than the lamb to the slaughter recorder I'm flowin like water
(YES..) Since you're popular, I see nothin stoppin ya
From generatin lucci livin larger than Gucci, HELLO
It's Mecca's hour when the man is in power
To roast there (what?) I cook a medium rare, so toast
Perignon Poppa, my rugged styles vary; shit
I want a salary Mariah couldn't Carey DIG IT
I sport a blue face Rolex for thirty grand (yeah..)
Now take your family to go see ""Who's the Man?""
I wear colognes that excite your hormones
And Versace the wifey bought, now who woulda ever thought?

You can't copy it down, so let it be subliminal (AOWW)

The extra blazin' I push
Is like Moses talkin' to the burnin' bush
Face the furious meltdown of underground bugs
The kingpin racing all my thugs, hear
When I set the flossing overhead now
With the click that makes you die for the family and god
No doubt we're facing this and guard your radius
When I come with the squad, that would dead it instantanious
Arms grab me, out to kill and fail to force fire
Just to put me in change behind Bob Wire
Keep a strap on his lap, son the gate is fat
Bless 'em, it's done
The dragon make it for blocks, til you open up the safe box
For new Glocks my revolution is cold as every hour
My firepower is aimed at your control tower
True that, I thought you knew that
My swerve is out of hand
Introducing scatter black
My stiffness

It's on, hands of the pocket wanna gun slinger
The street linger holdin' the dead bringer
Poppin' your dirty finger
Scatter, niggas fear the mercenary corner vet
Deep like the projects, America's threat
Walkin' nightmares shots wolves packed
And cray burners and switch blades
Havin' brothers runnin' like slaves
The warning five, generate pies, niggas will die
Trap the lost souls in the game that we specialize

Its Not a Game,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"Introducing the Mecca fusion, physical type of funk using
Carmel cruising brother, your latest lover smothered for deeper cover
Ass blown to breaks, individualized the fakes
Just because you're pouring syrup on this don't make it pancakes
My vocal assaults kept bouncing many amounts that count slackness
Pete Rock's sounds of blackness
The dark gauges the flavor I supply
Now it's do or die, others are rolling the chocolate thai
I rip holes in sows, then move flocks of foes in straight
The Devil will find a way to infiltrate, never pray
I hear the scandal that be couped up in my town
So now we ""Gotta Get Away"" like Bobby Brown
The women will call it two letters that are instrumental
I focus my eyesight and run it down your genitals
Another dame when I tear it out the frame
Then armageddon came, it's not a game, it's on
It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)
It's not a game when the Mecca Kane lucifer knows your name
Now I think I'm on the break of black male growing extinct
Now my survival they label the label homicidal
My spirits aren't idle, now you put your hands on the Bible
Now the opposite of my God is Nimrod
Taught by Master Fard, hard, now I'm pulling your card
We travel, unravel, dabble in the dopeness
A jam that make you want to know who wrote this
A scripture from an odyssey, brothers in high velocity
And just like BDP, you know ""My Philsophy""
Yeah here to outlast it, to never see the casket
My flute can make a snake rise up from the basket
So Pete Rock here we go, master the flow
(I don't want to be the last to know)
With the mellow funk tunes arriving with the card trainer plain
The black House of Pain, it's not a game, it's on
It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)
The lucci's mine like the summertime, and I'm a set it first
You leaving a hearse when my third verse loads up to burst
To blast, never to trespass, going to funk, keeping the crowd touring
The lyric is born on any stage we're walking on
So non-believer meet the Mecca, be chopping 'em like a meat cleaver
The scrambling quarterback, you know my the wide receiver
I get past you, and when it becomes a war
I go hardcore, matador, then all the bull is on the floor
I look and find the level of crime the time that I decipher
I'm bagging any sniper put a ball in Peter's Piper
We made the album of the year, remember the Source kicks?
We should have been larger but it's all politics
So (Why you wanna, uh huh, play your games on me?)
Cause you called me a factor, get your skully cracked
The truth is coming to take mine
You want to take away more stitches than a Frankenstein
In '93 me and the P.R. make the dough
The honeys are licking all over my 5 o'clock shadow
A menace to society, the pistol-packing YG
Mecca's the name, it's not a game, so don't try me
It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow

I am the one they call the G, the R, the A, the P and
I didn't write this, it's coming off the top of the dome
So what you wanna do and whatcha wanna go home
And tell your mama that I'm one wit all the mad drama
Yes I was causing the movies on 1 East 25th Street
I crossover, honey dips knew it was Harlem wheat
I was flowing on the place to be
Is being the capital rapper, the G-R-A-P
In the place to be wit my man Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Pass the bust a groove and the people begin to move
And get on the dancefloor
Got to move the funk you stinking little hores
And all the hoods and all the punks and all the suckers
Wit this shit I got stupid muthafukas
On my dick, what the fuk, I rock the mic so quick
Wit Adofo in the place to be
And my man Ross is right in back of me
Rob O, good to go
I've gots the F-L-O-W and that spells flow
Wit Chris Champ, oh what's up I'm bout to get amp
On top of the mic and I'm a set an exam -ple
Girls I pull, I got the honey dip, so what's up, my tank is full
Of sperm, I ready to bust a nut
What's up Pete Rock, come get on the cut

That's right, this is called The Basement!
And my man CL Smooth kick it for you like this..

From the Heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I'm your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my *errr!*
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I'm like a mink while you're soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave The Basement

The Basement, put the Funk in Grand
Here comes my man
My brother.. Grap Lover, get wreck cousin, c'mon

Call me the Grap Lover, yes, the younger Soul Brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won't find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don't slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people saviour
Clockin all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you're soon to discover
Yo, that's the kid from ""Mecca and the Soul Brother""
Yeah once in a while I be with CL on the DL
Or I flow with Pete, and find my placement in The Basement
The Basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, Grapster's out the door of The Basement

Of the Basement! Next we got.. a special guest
I ain't gonna tell you who it is..
C'mon.. rap along..

Tick tock tick, things are gettin - thick
Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I'm tellin ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I'm never strapped
But I know a crew of Young Gunz that'll send you back
So easy does it on the DL
Peace to Pete Rock, and the Mecca Don CL
Heavy D's on this track, lettin you know there's no replacement
Peace signin off, check one two straight from The Basement

Straight from The Basement
I'm tellin you now, kid
It's crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin up?
Fourth but not least, the backbone of the Wig Out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin, upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the U.S. states, even London
Pasttime present, black to the future
Swimmin in beats like a Dolphin, so call me Don Shula
A Raider well like Art Shell, crazy defense
A Pro Bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The Pimp Daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin from The Basement
That's right, crazy funky
Aww my man
He's crazy funky, his name is Rob-O, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you'll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, ""Pete makes beats in The Basement""
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I'd just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus Hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint's bumpin lovely
Walkin down the street, much props, on the ?
I hear voices sayin, ""That's Rob-O'Dingo in The Basement""

Ahh ha ha ha! Hah yeah! This is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is Di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin, like Snoopy, the Beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin raw papes off the shelves
Blowin up spots from state to state
I'm comin to town but you just can't wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in The Basement

In The Basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC's swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with CL Smooth
My man ?, Rob-O, G-R baby pah
The Heavster, my brother Grap Lover

They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.),Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
I reminisce, I reminisce
Uh! (I reminisce, I reminisce)
Yeah (I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)
(I reminisce, I reminisce)

I reminisce for a spell, or shall I say think back
Twenty-two years ago to keep it on track
The birth of a child on the 8th of October
A toast, but my granddaddy came sober
Countin' all the fingers and the toes
Now I suppose you hope the little black boy grows
Huh, eighteen years younger than my mama
But I rarely got beatings 'cause the girl loved drama
In single parenthood, there I stood
By the time she was 21, had another one
This one's a girl, let's name her Pam
Same father as the first, but you don't give a damn
Irresponsible, plain not-thinking
Papa said chill but the brother keep winking
Still he won't down you or tear out your hide
On your side while the baby maker slide
But mama got wise to the game
The youngest of five kids, hon here it is
After 10 years without no spouse
Momma's gettin married and a house
Listen, positive over negative for the women and master
Mother Queen's rising a chapter
Déjà vu, tell you what I'm gonna do
When they reminisce over you, my God

My God
It's so
Yeah, so lovely
That's how we like to do it in the 90's
Pete Rock & CL Smooth comin' atcha

When I date back I recall a man off the family tree
My right hand Poppa Doc I see
Took me from a boy to a man so I always had a father
When my biological didn't bother
Taking care of this, so who am I to bicker
Not a bad ticker but I'm clocking pop's liver
But you can never say that his life is through
Five kids at 21 believe he got a right too
Here we go while I check the scene
With the Portuguese Lover at the age of 14
The same age, front page, no fuss
But I bet you all your dough they live longer than us
Never been senile, that's where you're wrong
But give the man a taste and he's gone
Noddin' off, sleep to a jazz tune
I can hear his head banging on the wall in the next room
I get the pillow and hope I don't wake him
For this man do cuss, hear it all in verbatim
Telling me how to raise my boy unless he's taking over
I said pop maybe when you're older
We laughed all night about the hookers at the party
My old man standing, yelling ""Good God Almighty""
Use your condom, take sips of the brew
When they reminisce over you, for real

For real, baby
Like that
We for real
Comin' atcha
In '92
Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Yeah, c'mon, hit me!

I reminisce so you never forget this
The days of way-back, so many bear witness the fitness
Take the first letter out of each word in this joint
Listen close as I prove my point
T to the R the O-Y, how did you and I meet?
In front of Big Lou's, fighting in the street
But only you saw what took many time to see
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
Rain or shine, yes, in any weather
My Grandmom Pam holds the family together
My Uncle Doc's the greatest, better yet the latest
If we're talking about a car, Uncle Sterling got the latest
I strive to be live 'cause I got no choice
And run my own business like my Aunt Joyce
So Pete Rock hit me, 'nough respect due
When they reminisce over you, listen

Listen, just listen
To the funky song as I rock on
And that's word is bond
I'm not playin'
Everybody, just coolin'
This song we dedicate
To the one and only
Never be another
He was my brother
Trouble T-Roy
It's like that y'all
And you don't stop
Pete Rock and CL Smooth for '92
And we out, later",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-they-reminisce-over-you-troy-lyrics
The Creator,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"It's time to dip dive dip, you might break a hip
To the sound that's legit, I've come to make a hit
I usually bust scratches with my brother, C.L. Smooth
But, I decided to get wreck on this groove
As I provide the slide you're going on a ride
I know the weather's nice, there's no need to play the outside
Guess who's on the flyer, the man of your desire
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth all the honey-dips admire
Beats are rough and rugged, Pete Rock is the creator
Now I'm busting raps while switching cross-faders
Making sure my sound hits from here to Grenada
Honey gave me skins, man, I told her friends I ate her
But, wait up, I save this subject for later
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator

I'm addicted like a stoag, not into vogue
(Yo, Pete, there's a girl on the phone)
Tell her to hold cause I'm busy kickin' rhymes to the rhythm
Fortified with soul cause that's what I give 'em
Honeys form a line form a line cause I always seem to capture
Beats made of rupture, rhymes made of rapture
Far from illiterate, always seem to get a hit
If you try to step to this, don't even consider it
Skins when I want 'em, but, only when I need 'em
To set the record straight, I'll be damned if eat 'em
Call me Pete Rock, I make the girls flock
And if you want a beat like this, I got them in stock
So, flow with the flow, because you know I'm good to go
As I proceed to get wreck on your stereo
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator
Now, C.L. Smooth, cut it up like this
(scratching)

Now, I'm'a take a try and get a piece of the pie
If they give me one sec to get some wreck
Never filled with anger, a good body banger
If you try to step to this you'll get hung on my hanger
Before I say good-bye suckers gave a good try
But, point blank you just can't see this
My word is beneficial, Pete Rock is the issue
And I know you know my style is official
I might give a scratch (Yes, cousin)
Or I might kick a verse (No question)
Either one, I can't be seen, honeys call me tall and lean
And if you want to stick around, I'll show you what I mean
Not an imitator, just a crowd motivator
But, it's time to get wreck with the creator
It's time to get wreck with the creator
Get wreck with the creator
The creator
C.L. Smooth, get busy",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-the-creator-lyrics
Take You There,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Never judge a book by the cover
Discover the soul brother with the Mecca don
Working brunette to blonde
How many Edison con when I respond in full black
With us having the vernon villains back-to-back
Amazing grace when I face the great paper chase
For real its long overdue
So I dont wanna talk to you
I stroke the hell out of mademoiselle who insisted
Every night, she get her back twisted in the unlisted
Im living through my son so daddy see it this way
I want him in the NFL, his brother in the NBA
No doubt I'm with a piece, down in mecca, all crazy
To the late Eve, none of this is make-believe
I breathe some of the most powerful lyrics of our century
Battle physically, conquer mentally
Essentially, youre dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go yknow, Ill take you there

C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

Control now so in the future see me calling the shots
From larger plots to cash to mini-bikes and open mics
Im blowing up spots for knots in the millennium years
And now I drop it on my peers, brings tears and fears
And now the question manifest in my only
My soldiers wear Versace or the army fatigue
That brings a world of intrigue and glamour to my arsenal
Of gods, pimps to players and layers of decepticons
My whole mind-state gravitate to weapon
Making people in the business get a misconception
It aint hard to the core, it aint sex on the beach
Its just another plateau the brothers have to reach
Emphatic with non-cypher, then we were broke and misguided
Try to gas me like Hitler once we get divided
No question, youre dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, Ill take you there

C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there

Set it so I can make em all respect my fame
When brothers try to count all my chips in the game
Now let me civilize your foolish acts of gunplay
The plan of a stick man, the price in how to get away
Chose for negroes, the most hypnotical flows
On the planet, another East Coast track rose, goddammit
My theme, to mainstreams the knocker
Only time I get writer's block is when my lucci's on lock
Pretty much Im coming through in the clutch see
My thought is a bombshell, built to only propel
Or is it just my style of hustle making a mark
To rumble the playgrounds with more danger than Jurassic Park
It was dark, when I brought it to the light, for spite
My staffs got me taking nothing but champagne baths
Now the aftermaths dealing with a Mecca affair
So anywhere you wanna go, Ill take you there

C.L., whatcha gonna do?
You know you can make me move
Over, over again
Come on and take me there",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-take-you-there-lyrics
Searching,The Main Ingredient,1994,"You're everything that I dream about, talk about
Walk around and brag about, cause I don't give a damn about
What they say, what he say, or she say
I'm addicted like drugs to your loving, but hey
You got me strung like I'm young and it's crazy
You're making me nervous, I don't deserve this, 
I'm Swayze
I wish I could be but you really got a hold on me
With your sex appeal, I'm telling you how I feel, shit is real
Now I don't really want to play myself so I say to myself:
""Self get a grip and don't slip""
Cause I don't want you to think I'm some clown from out of town
I get down, I've been around, I ain't no hand-me-down
So you gotta show respect for me if you're checking for me
And don't sweat me cause I really don't want no sweat on me
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it

(I know how you want it) Don't tease me, just please me
(I know how you want it) Now what you gonna do when you get it?

Everybody knows you and they show you mad respect
You give me funny feelings with your million-dollar step
Never quiet is kept, honey always stayed dip
I'm thirsty for your love, sugar can I get a sip?
Well maybe just a taste in the place that make your face bend
And I would never try to kick it to your best friend
So what's the deal, what's the haps, where we at now?
Keeping it strong, moving it along, I'm here to show you how
So all I wanna know is what you really wanna do
I try to flex but sex ain't sex unless I'm sexing you
And I'll be swimming in some trim with a beachfront view
Cause all I wanna do is get next to you
Now leave your crew so we can step into my hideaway
So I can step into it right away
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it


Before you sit back and think I ain't saying nothing
You need to sit back and think about what I'm saying
Now relaying, my carmel flow
So you can see the arrow fly before it leaves the bow
Slow like Cupid, taken from a mobster
At night I crack her open just like a lobster
(My CL Smooth) It's all good baby
Now you know why I'm stressed when you act shady
Sometimes you chit chat, now and then hide the cat
When all I wanna do is just flip that
But there's a side to me only you can see
Only you can so believe in your man
I want you to love me in a special way
When I come home from making lucci to parlay
If you got it, good, flaunt it
You know what it takes and you know how I want it",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-searching-lyrics
Lots of Lovin,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Lots of lovin, lots of lovin

A sweet serenade, sip lemonade
As we laid inside the shade
My heart was captured when you possessed it
Carressed and blessed it, even suggested
You love me and I love you
And together, it would just be us two
I would protect ya, in your moment of fear
Relax, lover come here
And let's create this heavenly fantasy
When you lay next to me
I need you, and only you, to give me more
Tender love right down to the core
If you could read what's on my mind
You will find my feelings are genuine
Day after day, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
Make love everyday, okay, produce
I ride through the tunnel of love, share a milkshake
Carve our name in a tree by the lake
Look in your eyes cause I miss you much
The way you say, ""I love you, C.L."" and your gentle touch
We reminisce with a french kiss
And out of all the girls, you're the first on my list
The only one now, and truly for life
My fiancée and future wife
Now you realize, you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat

You want to be treated like a queen, stroked like a kitten
Every night you're the mitten I'm fittin'
Tease your lips with the tip of my tongue
And there's no doubt about it, lady, I'm strung
On your love, looks, and affection
You qualify, top choice selection
Woman of a darker breed
Mmm, cutie, you got what I need
Pour the champagne and toast the glass
Taste, but don't drink too fast
Cause we got many nights to cuddle by the fireplace
You blush when I touch your face
Now you realize you're the one I'm thinking of
With lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat

Allah made you beautiful and youthful
So I feel giving you love is suitable
A walk by the beach, watch the sunset
Love is strong, like when we first met
Wake up in the morning, see your face
And I feel no one can take your place
Ever, so don't even think about it
I need your love and I can't live without it
Baby, you're the one I'm thinking of
From C.L. Smooth, with lots of love

Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Lots of lovin, lots of lovin
Heat, the heat",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-lots-of-lovin-lyrics
Straighten It Out,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Uh, yeah. Uh-huh
We got Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth
And we're here to tell you to...
And that's a fact, baby
Now you're gonna kick some lyrics
Like this, c'mon...

Walk the fine chalk line, and put the needle to the grind
Representin' one kind, seeing eye for the blind
Witness what I carry on bears a further purpose
From how we do slam a few, then you want to purchase
A dialogue of funk, you love to pop it in your trunk
I win, more disciplined than a Shaolin monk
Pete Rock and C.L., well set to spark it
The powerful target to destroy the black market
But when you say black, listen, I don't know, you lose me
I guess another beggar can't afford to be choosey
I come to the maximum, artist on a major label
Any duplication of this one is fatal
On one two five, I gotta hit ya live
Beat your ass with my tape, any race or shape
Cuz if they got mine, they got yours too
But together here's what we gotta do

Tell 'em... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out
You know this is the word (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right y'all... straighten it out (say what?)
You got to... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... yeah
Straighten it out... it's like that (say what?)

The funk legacy I pass on, clearancy for high rates
Every time we sample all the past time greats
Stick it in the SP-1200 beat, I make a loop
Lovely, way to troop in a Lexus coupe
Just a little bit, set to make a whole lot happen
The musical inside my rappin'
Written by the C.L., produced by the P.R
And add in any credit that you heard thus far
I start from scratch, cuz the bassline's critical
Better than the original who first made it
Now you want to sue me, but fans never boo me
Believe I know the times, we been broke, too, G
Here's another sample clear, see ya, get the hell outta here
Like a bootleg, you're over for the year
You'll only get the credit where the credit is due
So, listen, what I shout out is true

Yeah, true... straighten it out
You gots to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
You got to tell 'em to... straighten it out
(Say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
C'mon (say what?)... straighten it out
That's right... straighten it out
Straighten it out (say what?)

Like the strands of lamb's wool, I'm thinkin' that's said
Here to go to the head and count the locks on a dred
I and I'd 'mit to verify, goin' to multiply
A theory many thought a conspiracy
Here to let you know that it applies to all of us
You're no exceptions to the rule and that's a plus
Cause who Jah bless, let no one curse
Straighten out what I be about, reckon above the clout
And let the management work for me
Because I don't need the unnecessary hostility
A proper marketing plan so we can gobble up the dough
Straighten it out, so everybody know
The kids are official with the purpose of a smooth surface
Kickin' the service one time to make 'em nervous
We're finally here and very long overdue
Pete Rock, this one's for the crew

You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
You gotta... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out (say what?)
Straighten it out... you got to
Straighten it out... c'mon (say what?)
Straighten it out
All black people must... straighten it out
Say what?

Straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
The YG's, they must... straighten it out
The Hilltop, they must...straighten it out
The whole money-earnin' must... straighten it out
Everybody must... straighten it out
Come on... straighten it out
Ah, yeah... straighten it out (to close)",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-straighten-it-out-lyrics
For Petes Sake,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Here come's the rugged one, bust the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
'Cause I can do wonders undercover
I'm dip-dip-dope, I rhyme like riz-ope
I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause slick like Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Plus the way that I flow...blood clot
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah...
So funky, like a street junky
Like I said before, here we go, c'mon...
For Pete's sake I break and update, wait, I radiate
A dubplate to navigate the tune I make
I fit like a slipper, so catch the Big Dipper
Vital signs are quicker, not the flat line picture
Showtime original, official with the smooth criminal
I hit the cliches on the subliminal
With the soul technician to fill the prescription
In addition listen close to the mission
The P.E.T.E.R.O.C.K., resume
With the route to Brut by Faberge
No doubt, to shout about a 20-bar segment
Offspring of lyrics when the microphone's pregnant
Give it a rubdown, now here's the sermon
Everywhere you go you hear Mecca from the Vernon
Pound for pound, uptown, I get down
And bound to spin the record like a merry-go-round
The klepto flow that I touch is not a preemie
And who would ever see me when I dream of Jeanie
I don't think so, peace, I gotta go
And shake like an earthquake, cousin, for Pete's sake
To my man...
Here come's the rugged one, bust the way I flip it
I collect the loot and then I knock the boots
A smooth dark brother, prefer to be called the chocolate lover
'Cause I can do wonders undercover

I cleanse like soap, cause it's the great black hope
Stay away from the penile, I can rock the senile
Hons always wave cause I'm slick like Nu-nile
Pete Rock on the boot knock, on the boot knock
Bust the way that I flow...blood clot
Yo, my style's cock-diesel and I can do the hustle
Niggas know the time, I don't have to flex a muscle
I'm not the type to fake it, I wouldn't try to take it
Tie your girl to the back of my Jeep butt-naked
Slide her monkey ass down the hill
So if you don't want beef, money, chill for Pete's sake
To my man...
Music please...
(C.L.) The Mecca's sweet like nectar, maybe 'cause you need it
There's a ribbon in the sky, but I wonder if you see it
In the days of thunder, notice how I suplex in the proper context
Here steps the one, the answer to the riddle
Survey says the black pres can make you wiggle
The staff to the craft, the stroke of a painter
Perfect stranger, melody arranger
Loopholes are filled when I build with the skill
Liquid steels the mic on the Rock's chill
No financial aid wade when I'm paid
Deep as the Everglade, the escapade a renegade
Study in the archives, place your bet, sonny
Head crack back to back for the bail money
For you, a chapter, slayed by the author
Lickin' on your daughter, say, south of the border
Now, here we are with the funky repertoire
Draw warm like a spa, star, forget all the hoopla
C.L. Smooth and Pete Rock
Could break and penetrate, piece of cake, cousin, for Pete's sake

For Pete's Sake, c'mon...

Check it out and give me my 'spect
Check it out and give me my 'spect
Check it out and give me my 'spect
Check it out and give me my 'spect

Hit the lights and I appear beyond the stratosphere of Meccable function
And if you're pretty let your lady sleep in Carmel City
Begin and end the day on Lennon hunts for beachfronts
To lit blunts, now all agreed we're sippin OJ with the Dom P
Bounce and bring it like it counts to be Luccified
CL is sextified and women spell me nationwide
You say you want my lips where and I can grab your what?
I love your hips legs breasts faces with the firm butt
Now feel the muscle when I hustle in the bedsheets
Cause my manly treats can hit the fridge for more sweets
SPLASH, and let me do my thing til it's hot and sweaty
Reload the CamCorder, I guess by then you'll be ready
Cause All My Children got One Life to Live
But knockin wifey out the box is clearly a negative
I'm in rugged wears with fancy facial wears
And all the real shit come in pairs, and bounce em in the house y'all

Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house

Back again, I'm here to win, to bust rhymes on beats again
Copycats and rugrats, sit back and watch a champion
It's time to wreck shop and show the world I'm true to hip-hop
So check the style and peace to niggas in the penile
Now umm, it's the original Funky Chicken tactic
I run game on your brain for the fame cause I'm active
You try to follow in my footsteps, you can't do it
I'm pullin your card it ain't hard, I don't have to prove it
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the utmost
From coast to coast, the music makes you overdose
You fiend, for the gangsta lean, I makes you scream
Rugged Bro Soul on the scene
A.k.a. the funk doer, numero uno, that means
Number one I get the job done plus I pack a gun

Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house
Pete Rock is in the house, C.L. is in the house

Money up steps the new era of my lyrical terror
Funkadelic for lightin up spots ever since little tots
When the dust settle I'm packin heavy metal plenty
The drop'll slaughter many, strictly off illegal entry
It's elementary Watson
, I drive a Benz not a Datsun
Before my kicks hit the stage, we've been Foot Locking
Body rockin to keep the ladies flockin with a concoction
Rippin your blouse for no less than arrest in Morehouse
My teeth grits where my knife slits, we train em
And scar em like pits, off vibes of the Mecca joint
Vibe to position, never runnin out of ammunition
Now to the heart, I'm steppin with a concealed weapon
Nothing's calm when the bomb blaze you know the phrase
It's Pete Rock and CL Smooth knockin nowadays
Eastside kid, you don't want none, so catch a relay
I'm lettin off on anybody tryin to steal my DJ

Where CL's God, and the ladies gotta hit me off
Ballin on the set now baby what's the matter
When all this is Hot Sex served on a platter
Enter my flow so I can hit this show with somethin rugged
It's mainly how all the honeys dug it
Like every single day and, bounce around the way and
Chicks are never waiting when the bodies start marinating
We expand in player's land to unknowns
To turn my stumbling blocks, into my stepping stones
The pound Donna Karan New York down found
Where there can be no type of slacking in your macking
The whole agenda is for me to decide; the major hustle
Is God, when brothers coincide, with the bonafide
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City

C'mon y'all

Top notch, butterscotch, lyrics hits the mode
To make the most gorgeous women wanna get nude
Your eyes stay glued, when this is popping word is bond
Wifey's gone, now I'm about to get my swerve on
Lay my clothes across the bed, cause I'm here to make a point
Plenty chips, got me balling in a hot joint
Respect the sextafied aura you could never take light
It's like bringing a knife to a gunfight
My large releases got me mixing with the dimepieces
And down to rival one of Uncle L's little nieces
In my palace of pleasure, everything is done properly
And if you didn't know, you better ask somebody
Right now, the players are the power structure
Check the roly-poly, now it's time you see the brother
CL Smooth, you know the Mecca Don
Where love is only for me, in Carmel City

It's freaktacular, wasn't hard to get em out the blouse
If only wifey knew, hubby got a stash house
And what moves your man got with so much emphasis
Maybe one or two many get ridiculous
So scandalous, the honey arrives with her crew
And now they're talking bout coming back without you
Yeah my boys are balling, here's the raw deal:
Come to my house, you gotta get naked for real
Indulging, my peoples said let's have a talk
About the time my lady's plane hit New York
I'm bailing off the set, heading for the crib G
Cause I'm the first thing the woman wanna see
Take a hot shower, slip on some linen
Now it's a new time, a new day, a new beginning

Return of the Mecca,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"To know the truth is to know the self
To know the self is to know the Mecca
Mecca's not a state of mind or a place
Mecca is a way of life
It is the answer to all confusion
The attribute
Adolpho, Abdullah, Mohammed
Makes way for the return of the Mecca
Salaam

Return of the Mecca

Be sure to explore the hardcore that came before Columbus
Discover no other serve the soul on a dish
Okay means official kid, not decrepit though
The lyrical dynamo set the flow when I do so
Entice the price with the mic device
Hit ya slice so precise that you never hurt twice
Fierce how I pierce when you near the frontier
A world premiere so put the armor on your gear
The overlord aboard with the two-edged sword
Adored and restored, now the young gun toward
Preserve the herb, never kick it to the curb
Vocalize a verb, and the return of the word
Mecca, the reincarnated selector
From the whole agenda, something to remember
A richer voice than Robin Leach
I'll reach with a speech, no bleach so you can't impeach
Monumentally smooth, I'll prove it sincerely
To barely when you're near me clearly never sound weary
Maintain the gravity, assault and battery
So sweet the repeat you're bound to catch a cavity
My ability to wreck a facility
C.L.'s potential, smooth and sequential
Deep in every measure, hit the lotto for the beggar
The midnight wrecker, return of the Mecca


Overstand the Mecca in command
Part of the plan is the man who built the land he began
A scripture ripped out the piece of a scroll
Better the know yes, a foretold, the beautiful and bold
Start em in Harlem with the motto, the Apollo
Boogie to me, I'll swallow hollow when you follow
Stable like a turntable, lyrics I cradle
No fable, label or run my tongue around your navel
You're coming to me so therefore the program's Mecca
The silhouette, a weirder fella, darker than vanilla
Talking about the theoretical, isometrical
Alphabetical rebel, a dissect-the-devil
Unveil a tale in detail, the third rail
Read it in braille, a bigger male leave a trail
Now I sink into the link, that'll make you think
You's too large to shrink, I need a drink
And toast to emperor, Mecca said to invent
To know of a child, worth your while so surrender
And never to be lobotomized, the flexin' of the stanza
But you know the answer when I drop a proper grammar
Tabasco, the Late Show, flow to make a peso
I manage to do damage so honey, get Macco
Risen from the prison, the division, Black and Decker
Strictly for your pleasure, return of the Mecca



OD off the black Baryshnikov
Taking it up north, back and forth, never been soft
Bound to see me swollen like a Beethoven
Listen wide open, never toking, do or die's my slogan
Save the sarcasm, I'll hit you like a orgasm
Back off of that and maybe later let you pat em
Necessary for any adversary to worry
The legendary, primary, never secondary
Dip in Peru, overdue in Honolulu
Now if you knew the preview, could bubble like shampoo
Outclass the mass so we'll look in the hourglass
No time to waste for those in contrast
Like the New York Philharmonic, sent to blow melodic
With the logic I hear like a narcotic
Put your best to rest, so get your bulletproof vest
I got the wild, wild west to your chest
You know the cause of death, so forget the autopsy
Another got sloppy so I lit it in poppy
Smooth as Peabo, with dough like Lillo
For the grand finale I slip on like a Bally
C.L. and P.R., categorizing we are
The soul brother, Mecca lover, funky by far
The classic fantastic, rip it like elastic
Here to get drastic, return of the Mecca",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-return-of-the-mecca-lyrics
I Got a Love,The Main Ingredient,1994,"What's going on baby?
Ain't nutting - it's CL Smooth
Sextafied everyday; you gotta know that this live
Let's get right to it

I ain't got the love
Cut the funky records, for me and the crew and
I ain't got the love
I'm like tellin you straight on up

Feel the vibe, when it's bumping in my tribe, steps the Goodfellas
Live on screen now you protect the black queen
Takin my time from the black on black crime
Cause the night Mecca hits, Victoria runs out of secrets
Doing trials in latex Lifestyles Boo; I make you
Call my name, and ask who it belongs to
Brand new, with CL, in Carmel, living well
And never cease to flip the hottest dimepiece
Now the legend increase into a great, truly Mecca made
So in every escapade there's a panty raid
You know the rules, slipping off them ewes; then we can settle
With the woman that can take me to that next level
Lay down the guns and make sons we can teach
From the horseback rides, and the walks on the beach
And if you got pretty feet I won't cheat
I'm into strictly black pearls when I rocket y'all to different worlds


You want a slow wind under my ceiling fan, read books
And beat me at chess, but as for rocking you, who's the best?
It's all good and correct with no disrespect
Skirt chasing hits, 
taking love to Digable Planets
Be wise and recognize, I'd rather show than tell
Who got the clout to stop faking me all out
Ease your troubles, place your body in the bubbles
Dimepieces fit around the cutie she run with
Embrace the mood, thinking totally nude with no limits
Going through every position within five minutes
Now how we did it got a lot of honies with it
Love is urban now fitted showing nothing but the belly button
Many parlay, and peel off lingerie
So when they come pick the one you could learn from
So feel the beat in Three-Peat like Jordan got wings
Cause I'm doing them things, listen


At last come the goodies, every woman got a love
Hot with all that sex appeal for real, can I hit that?
I'm warmer than your triple-goose with hands like a masseuse
Don't play; cause I'm the hood your mama loves anyway
My heart flips when you take long business trips
I want a divorce, no I think I wanna see your boss
Check you later honey, searchin in your coach bag for money
Before you leave, I hug you til you can't breathe
We Kool and the Gang, and kick slang, baby call in sick
But you kiss me goodbye, and said, ""I don't trick""
She's so thick, and God is my witness
Sometimes you just can't believe that I'm gettin this
Rewind off the Pete Rock design
I want a cutie with a ageless body and timeless mind
The kind that when I wine and dine she pay the bill
Cause it don't cost much to go Dutch baby",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-i-got-a-love-lyrics
The Basement,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Ahh yeahh!! Feel the funk bay-beeee!!
That's right, this is called The Basement!
And my man CL Smooth kick it for you like this..

From the Heights, not what, am I right? Simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I'm your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hijackin' fella
So prepare for landin', and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stock
Now, all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my *errr!*
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon, I'm like a mink while you're soon to pimp a raccoon stall
Vocal arrangement, ready, set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave The Basement

The Basement, put the Funk in Grand
Here comes my man, my brother...
Grap Lover, get wreck cousin, c'mon

Call me the Grap Luva, yes, the younger Soul Brother
Keep your eyes on the prize 'cause you won't find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don't slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people savior
Clockin' all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you're soon to discover
Yo, that's the kid from ""Mecca and the Soul Brother""
Yeah, once in a while I be with C.L. on the DL
Or I flow with Pete and find my placement in The Basement
The Basement, yes, where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace, I gotta go, Grapster's out the door of The Basement

Of the Basement!
Next we got... a special guest
I ain't gonna tell you who it is...
C'mon, rap along

Tick, tock, tick, things are gettin' thick
Here comes the Heavster and I know it makes ya sick!
To see a black man gettin' paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas, I'm tellin' ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I'm never strapped
But I know a crew of Young Gunz that'll send you back
So easy does it on the DL
Peace to Pete Rock and the Mecca Don C.L
Heavy D's on this track, lettin' you know there's no replacement
Peace, signin' off, check one, two straight from The Basement

Straight from The Basement
I'm tellin' you now, kid, it's crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin' up?

Fourth but not least, the backbone of the Wig Out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin' upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the U.S. states, even London
Pastime present, black to the future
Swimmin' in beats like a Dolphin, so call me Don Shula
A Raider well like Art Shell, crazy defense
A Pro Bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The Pimp Daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin' from The Basement

Uhhhhh, that's right, it's crazy funky
Aww my man
He's crazy funky, his name is Rob-O, c'mon baby

Alakazam, you'll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin' ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks like days
What kid said, ""Pete makes beats in The Basement""
Cool, hit the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I'd just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus Hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint's bumpin' lovely
Walkin' down the street, much props, on the sin
Yo I hear voices sayin', ""That's Rob Odindo in The Basement""

Ahh ha ha ha! Hah yeah! This is funky! I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is Deda, Baby Pa

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin', like Snoopy, the Beagle
People, grab a tight hold of yourselves
Pa snatchin' raw tapes off the shelves
Blowin' up spots from state to state
I'm comin' to town but you just can't wait
Check the station for conversation at six
Blah Uno here to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Diggin' up crazy shit like psychology
So, speak the peace, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in The Basement

In The Basement is where I dwell, sucka MC's fell
'Cause I am crazy funky
C.L. Smooth, my man Rahsaan, Rob-O, Deda Baby Pa
The Heavster, my brother Grap Luva
Everybody...*fades out*",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-the-basement-lyrics
I Get Physical,The Main Ingredient,1994,"It's going down from out of town
Off the wicked streets of New York trouble
Me and my man map the plan and make a hefty bundle
Blessing weight to listen to greats from the bassment gates
Making the dubplates that cause quakes in other states
My soldiers guzzle 40's with the shorties working the scenes
In tight jeans that blows all your boyfriends to smithereens
On a scout to get humped out from the zone, bumping Babyface
When everything's live, I let my Boo drive
Now do my hot shells ring bells and my knockouts settle beef
Any last requests? You better make it brief
Kid from 'Life Sucks' to 'Major Bucks' while Pete rocks
Control blocks from ballplayers to corner hustlers
Here come the Spark Brothers, many retire when I open fire
Dropping smooth synthetic, the physical's mental
But the outcome is energetic
Larger clientele, drops by the CL, the spiritual
To set it one time on the physical

I get physical, mystical, very artistical

You must be silly my soul is Bigger than Willie to shock a city
With some of the Mecca-fied joint at the boiling point
Making stable moves, wrestling grooves, here comes the pain
My style's invisible knives, slicing to the root of your brain
Funk locks when the terror come to box from the Pete Rizzocks
Knocks the ghetto blaster funking full fashion
Now dames kick the sham real slow, talking the shopping's urgent
There hasn't been that much scheming since Eve met the serpent
My love rules Daisy Duke's amused
Check the view of the issue my flexing bounce to your body tissue
You know the Iceberg Slim, dig it Daddy, let the click grows
Exotic to my foes, how I pimp these hoes
Don't be surprised, you get Tysonized, the ultimate test
Is like Sweet Pea spankin all of Chavez best
Blessed on a lyrical slugfest, cause every round's critical
One blow that kept the dough physical


You better brace yourself, in other words, fasten seatbelts
When the Carmel melts, you love spots in your poom poom shorts
No one can rock me and my latest aristocracy of Funktasia
I represent the full intent to bring the flavor
Head or gut, steady laying in the cut, fool it's mine kid
For niggas doin a master race Scarface bid
Maintain God, and keep it all solid
From the Overlord Adolpho Muhammad
To game written twenty years down the line still hitting
Making arena sites rougher than the hockey fights
It's just one of those nights, topsy turvy like a roller derby
Style is coming sturdy any way you wanna work me
Check the bizarre and hear a star, with so much
Chocolate over the Carmel, we need to own a candy bar
But before we merc, run the drill I get physical
Mystical, very artistical",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-i-get-physical-lyrics
All the Places,The Main Ingredient,1994,"""All the places and spaces I've been"" (Repeat 4x)

Welcome to the zone where the strong only survive
The places I drive? all the gangsters can't stay alive
Take my universal journey through the jungles of the hardest town
Where my brothers lay their life down
You want something to play with?
Go find yourself some toys, when you mistake these grown men for little boys
More real than what is real, so feel 'em sending
Compare the God with no beginning and we'll have no ending
My blessed rings are down with the king's revelation
Had heard me on the Run-DMC's reincarnation
Child abuse, women loose, robbery and triple homicide
Everywhere this black man resides still
Check the monologue, I'm off for 6 a.m. jog
To regain my powers, do a set before the showers
I'm prime for the summertime, the big time bowler
But any season, no reason we can't take it over

""All the places and spaces I've been"" ""Can you feel it?"" (Repeat 6x)

Are you ready for the legendary crazy rugged rated raw
Known to be the smooth who sat by the door
Furthermore, for you and I to click, here's the stats
Take all that dirty money, set the pot stores and laundry mats
You love to gamble now we open up an after-hours spot
20 sacks with the Guinness for the jackpot
Members only, playing pool like Willie Mosconi
With a tenderoni chatting about the GS I'm batting
I'm patting down with the sound of a general
Fully supplied by my ghettofied residential
We come to rebuild and turn off the heat now
Hoping we can take it back to Huguenot Street
Palled around the screen TV watching the fight
Tonight, cause if it ain't rough it ain't right
Ink tents in all of my circumference I connect
Now demanding all types of respect, can you dig it?


Travelling the warp speed we come to the peak
Like a missile I probe and seek, many can't critique
My physique is still solid, chiseled down to the very last compound
I'm trying that chin, fool, where you been?
Still sliding girls in soon as pops fall asleep
His game tight, set to flip a shorty late night
I like rocks and rubies, condo shows and cuties
The hottest cars and the strongest drinks at the bars
This is one of those joints that make you stand by the exits
Cause every time I'm yapping something crazy happens
Keep my tool in my baggy jeans rolling with sneaker fiends
Who got a life term working for the firm
My labor's fruit off of business as usual
Plus my two clan band is making me a wealthy man
Now from where I stand, believe it's not a game
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth's a household name",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-all-the-places-lyrics
Soul Brother #1,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"""He's a SWEET soul brother""
Here comes the (Soul x4)
(Soul x4)
Here comes the (Soul x4)
Here comes the (Soul x4)

Soul Brother #1, here I come on the new tip
Nestle coated right, 'cause I'm rich thick and chocolate
Plug up any mic I'll bet you Pete Rock'll spark it
Huns always ask what's the bulge in my pocket
I tell 'em, ""Papes"", I rock them top to bottom
Never hesitate to say; (""Mmm I got 'em"")
I rest on the Hillside, over on the chill-side
Of town, so let's get down
Funky is the word describe this Brother on a Soul mission
Hookin' rugged joints, more Soul than the Soul Kitchen
C.L. does the scratch, so I won't leave you itchin'
White people even say, ""Pete Rock is bitchin'""
Harder than the hardest, odder than the oddest
I guess that's just because I'm smarter than the smartest
So back up, clear the path hon 'cause here I come
Soul Brother #1

I hit harder than a kick, quick to scoop a chick
When it comes to skinz, Pete Rock got it thick
I'm not your average, everyday, one-two to the beat
And don't stop, bust the shit I drop
New style for the 90's Pete Rock's a trendsetter
I'd just be lyin' if I said there's someone better
You can ask Greta, Greta with the red Jetta
Honey did me lovely and I'm glad that I met her
I come style after style, sucker MC's try to swallow
But them seem to say my style's too hard to follow
So just raise your hand and give praise to the #1
Soul Brother, who keeps the crowd in a daze
Pete Rock, and C.L. Smooth and if it ain't our groove
Then you might not move
Remember, 'cause there's no need to worry none
Yo, Soul Brother #1
* Pete Rock cuts and scratches *
Soul Brother #1

Nuff respect to my man Grand Puba
Nuff respect to my man Biz Markie
Nuff respect to my man C.L. Smooth
Nuff respect to EPMD
I'm like high octane, with everything to gain
Those who try to step to this can catch pain
I keep a mag in the trunk of my Jag, in case some punk fag
Wants to catch one bag
Soul Brother #1, and I didn't come to riff
The finesse I possess will make the hardest unstiff
I'm full of motivation handle any situation
Hon said I'm so smooth they should call me lubrication
Mr. Splendor, a good back bender
Honeys always say, Pete love me tender
Call on Pete Rock, C.L. Smooth if you want the job done
Soul Brother #1
""He's a SWEET soul brother""",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-soul-brother-1-lyrics
Its on You,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Chorus (
with EPMD samples
):
On you (""Smile in my face, behind my back they talk trash"")
On you (""Mad and stuff because they don't have cash"")
On you (""When I roll and stroll, cool always pack a tool"")
On you (""Just in case... a brother acts a fool"")

It's death before dishonor, strap the vest down tight when you bring the drama
Now raise up off mine, and taste it in the raw
Before snipers on the floor galore, in my hardware store
Nightmares of thirsty crooks, niggas all acting fishy working off the books
Painting pictures of poverty, causing armed robbery
And if provoked, every last one gets smoked
No doubt for real it's like wildlife
Where thugs forever pull caps and always keep a knife
Cause on the strip, warfare's inevitable, hot steel's incredible
And if surprised, the revolution won't be televised
When I supply and demand, as I build my currency to expand, Call it progress when I bless my territory all respect due
But can niggas keep it real? It's on you
Chorus
Step into the dragon's lair, where CL's the don and Pete's the creator
Now praise the most high and represent the best
Cause the number one killer of black men is stress
The armed and dangerous, the bulletproof
Couldn't stop the homicide of another youth
Penetrating your body parts with hollow point shells, you fraud
Cause vengeance is mine said the Lord, indeed
My own click now turns greedy
Out of twelve of my soldiers, one will deceive me
With salt in the game, shame the family and push
My black ass straight into a terrifying ambush
The whole empire's at stake
Mastering the streets, devil the mental won't break and turn snake
For Pete's sake you gotta be true to the crew
So if niggas want to set it, it's on you
Chorus
Capture the beast within me, beware when it's moving deep in New York City
The diabolical gangster chronicle mob scenes in all directions
The type of connections to get your wig split
Submit the wanted signs posted, chickens spots for major knots you get toasted
To the head piece, I release firepower, only I'm controlling
We put in work and got the right brothers rolling
When hell kicks off we lick off
Keeping mine hard like stone from the red zone, to each his own
Smile in my face behind my back you talk trash
Hope my pockets hit empty and my Lexus crashed
But not in your wildest dreams
Hear my name in all the scandals and all the schemes, I rest in Queens
The 
Vernonville's my capital
, so memorize the cuts
Then give you two more seconds to get off these nuts, it's on you
Chorus
*song fades out and a freestyle session fades in*

Check it, Grap Luva, if you're in the house
Just get on the mic and show 'em what it's all about

It's all about the wicked check one two
Cause I rips a microphone and pass it to my crew
I don't drink no brew, I smoke nuff spliffs, I don't have no riffs
So check me as I shoot the gift
Rip rhymes, freestyle rhymes
Off top of the dome every time
I'm glad this shit is going on tape
So I can escape into the beat and make nuff papes
Word to God, kicking nuff freestyle rhymes

Ghettos of the Mind,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Ghetto of the Mind...
I catch a body at a party, sort of herbal with the verbal
Look above and see the vultures fly around in a circle
Baggin' while you're lollygaggin', raggin', tow-taggin'
Assassin with the millimeter roars of a dragon
Here stood the black hood, thirsty for the end
And for the love of money, kind of funny, new friends
Public housing, a thousand in a tent
So I'm forced to sell hell just to pay the rent
Killin' my own people, I put 'em out of order
Just like the liquor store scene on every corner
I'm tryin' but the kids keep cryin', and the bullets keep flyin'
Look, a boy, he's on the curb just dyin'
Finally the cops come dumb to the slum
Pull out a gun and arrest the wrong one
Wax all the Puerto Ricans and blacks
So they can never relax
I dwell, might as well learn the facts
Pete Rock and C.L. can radio a shack up
Sparkin' off and have 'em all callin' for backup
""Watch another crime and you're gonna do time""
All this you'll find in the ghettos of the mind
Ain't that somethin'?
Listen to cats and rough rats war under the window
When the ghetto forts flurry, never was a Tom and Jerry
Livin' ain't cheap, my survival is deep
In this part of town where the city never sleep
A Barney Miller roller, you can bet the car's stolen
Or static with your BM, only when you see them
Speakin' on your baby's mom, a best for the drama
Always tryin' to make a movie, little stark-ravin' looney
Stressin' it, but you know the ghetto keep ya busy
A place that when I die it would never even miss me
Crack phials in the aisles as one pimp smiles
Dope piles workin' hookers by the miles
But still my pop's got three jobs to stable
A family household and food on the table
So as we pray for all our souls to keep
Somebody's on the project roof, ready to leap
I want to stop the pain or the bad situation
But backwards wisdom I can't afford to give 'em
Self savior is much braver with the conscious behavior
Designed in the ghettos of the mind
Ain't that somethin'? Yeah, c'mon
It's like that y'all
I could never look forward to an early retirement
But still I maintain in a hostile environment
Hustlin' the concrete jungle for loot
My parents hated blood money so they gave me the boot
Take a risk cause the peer pressure has the edge
It was a blessin' when I saw my life dangle on the ledge
The streets coulda swallowed me whole
But the pain was all gone when I got to see my healthy son born
And now I bring him home to the ghetto
Only to make a stronger fellow
Maybe do some good for the neighborhood
It's hard playing hero livin' less than a zero
Raging Bull like DeNiro, the modern day pharoah
A concentration camp with the Section 8
Welfare checks given at a monthly rate
Apply for the get high, or just plain lazy
Many steady collect right around the fifth baby
The hawk is out but the niggas never pack it
A hundred dollar sneakers with the skimpy-ass jacket
When people are deaf, dumb, and blind they get left behind
Imagine in the ghettos of the mind",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-ghettos-of-the-mind-lyrics
Escape,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Check the verse in the Bible says man shall never covet
But in your life you put nothing above it, you seem to love it
Invest some stock to clock what's in my stable
Sweating me like Cain sweating Abel
, you're unstable
You couldn't speak, now what's the fake smile for?
The jealousy, that's why you're feeling so insecure
Used to be by my side but now all I see is pride
On the quest for big lucci, got you open wide
It feels funny, cause it never used to be that way
Remember PR back in the day?
Hey, the number's changed and the crib's a little fatter
But if you was real, you'd see it really wouldn't matter
Check the stat in fact yo, don't ever try to peep this
Don't mistake my kindness for a weakness
The name is Pete Rock, I'll take you higher than the 
izm
I'm on a exodus, Escapism

Yo, check it out
I like to rhyme, no time for silly head games
Strictly known for busting up your bed frames
But skins bold, act like they want to know a nigga
Break they neck to show they figure
But yo, you can't gas me up, you can't hype me
Play it cool when it comes to schooling wifey
On the ways of life it's strife, checks, and big money
So the next kid will be up on your honey
Sexing your honey, flexing your Benz and your money
Playing you like a crash test dummy, so take it from me
Cause when it happens don't say I never told you so
Heed the verbal lessons in the flow
And ayo, you know they style, and yeah I'm here to warn ya
Getting shaky cause I'm coming up on ya
It's Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth on a major pape mission
Rising to the top, Escapism

I'm sitting back, I got the funk on cruise
While you snooze Pete Rock is steady paying his dues
Putting styles on lock and making beats by the bundle
Scooping more props than Bryant Gumbel, and staying humble
But then you go and have to act that way
I just hit you off the other day!
But this is sick, cause here you come with your crew of derelicts
Talking about you need a pair of kicks, or this or that
You hang around cause the pockets are fat
But when I'm on ""E"" yo, you ain't trying to check for me
You got more game than rugby
You're only stressing the name and that the papes is flowing lovely
So stop searching for idealism
And check the off-beat flow of the Soul Brother with the realism
Shedding some light just like a prism
You can't wait, you can't fake it, Escapism",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-escape-lyrics

That you're kickin like Pelé, flows even Bo knows
My versatility capability is simply bourgie
Y to the o-u-n-g, another G-to the u-n-s
Let's back up, shortie, from the naughty like shorty
Berry Gordy with a forty gettin papes, oh Lordy
Claim you shoot more rounds than an Uzi
Stop the violence, 'cause ya can't do me
New York to L.A. say what I play
So catch a runaway smooth like a Billie Holiday
You couldn't bag me, boy, with a hefty
Train like Rocky but still can't step to me
So take a hint, money, leave it alone
And play like Stephanie Mills and find a 'Home'
Plus I never boogaloo with Yakub
We're mixed with the tricks in a alphabet stew
When I design a army I can reign
But never have more beef than Saddam Hussein
The night cap, so prepare for a cat scan

Schizophrenic, on a panic I do work
When you lurk with the professional ceremonial expert
The bold swinger
The Asiatic acrobatic lover won't sing the blues when I tap it
Save the mystery for Agatha Christie
Gimme a break, better wake Chief Kanisky
I'm not your ordinary modern day cliché
'Cause I'm here to save you little lost souls anyway
Go with the flow with the fleets when it executes
Any comp livin got buried in black suits
The limelight, never let it confuse you
It's a _Fantasy Island_ without a Tattoo
The hardcore few tend to look for
'Cause troop can't buy a knuckle game in a store
Making movies like your name is Faye Dunaway
Then hear the rumor echo in the project's hallway
You want a fast break, me no static
But Mister Whipple can't dribble like Magic
I yolk em up in domination, nerds got scrambled
The Tony Randall left in shambles

Let me see..
Pete Rock is like salad dressing when I toss another lesson
Ready or Not, prime time After 7
I pull women like a wisdom tooth
Without any conversation with Doctor Ruth
Making island girls wind with the glamity
'When Doves Cry', Apollonia and Vanity
Picture the Mary Jane frame on a mantle
Consider me a vandal the Virgin can't handle
And never clown downtown with Pat Sajak
Popping that yang riffin ""Homie don't play dat""
So don't gas the kid to make a movie
While I'm smackin a booty who just love to rock a doobie
Even though I make petty cash like a beggar
With no stash, I make a Air bet and knit a sweater
So the night cap of rappin', no slackin', backin'
Hand clappin', feet tappin' Chief and Captain
Could finger-lick the papes like there is no other

On and On,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"I am the one they call the G the R the A the P and
I didn't write this it's come off the top of the dome
So what'cha wanna do, and what'cha wanna go home
And tell, ya mama
That I'm one with all the mad drama
Yes I was causing, the movies on 125th St
I crossed over honey dip knew it was Harlem Week
I was going on the place to be
It's me, the capital rapital G-R-A-P
In the place to be with my man Pete Rock & CL Smooth
Gots to bust the groove as the people begin to move
And get on the dance floor
Got to move the funky stinkin' little whores
And all the hoods, and all the punks, and all the suckers
What the fuck I got stupid motherfuckers
On my dick
What the fuck I rock the mic so quick
With Adolfo, in the place to be
And my man Ras is right in back of me
Rob-O good to go, I got to f-l-o-w and that spells flow
With Chris Champ, and what's up I'm bout to get amped
On top of the mic, and I'ma set an exam-ple
Girls I pull, I got the honey dips so what's up my tank is full
Of sperm, I'm ready to bust a nut
What's up Pete Rock come get on the cut
Rock to beat, get wreck on the regular
Listen to me because I cause mass hysteria
Peace!!

The nightcap was exiled, steadily profiled
As the underachievin non-believin can't stand to reason
Where's your daddy boy - to categorize the drinker
Misunderstood to make the ordeal linger
They label me a problem child who can't cope
Hangin by a thread, yes a very thin rope
Inevitably, can never be the man can I tell ya
Visualize and memorize him in a cellar
Well tally-ho, pip-pip, my fam's gonna catch a fit
My father lookin like he wanna bust my lip
But that was never good for my health
So I take the shovel out my pocket and dig myself
Now when I look at the man in the mirror
I see things much more clearer my Lord
I'm not that popular, less than a dollar
But the pengo I pack can make you holla
* Pete Rock scratches various ""on and on"" samples *

I said, what you don't know could make a whole new world
Man, listen! I'm set to sabotage premonition
Your propaganda, crooked type of version
Some of the things I bring, you're babblin non-person
Imbedded in my character, rebel nostalgia
Uncommon valor who'd rather
Have no man-made religion or sect
But try to believe what you conceive may be half correct
I shed light, to show the path in sight
'Cause a man who can't treat you right can't teach you right
In front of your eyes, what a surprise, and let the nature rise
Just for the girls and the guys
A Phi-Slamma-Jamma when you wear a bandanna
Peace to Pop Dukes, and long live Nana
The formula's reality, Pete Rock's the storm
Together, forever, yes G we got it goin on
* Pete Rock scratches various ""on and on"" samples *

Internal affairs, flippin Hollywood Squares
In search of the Mecca many travel in pairs
Off the slave ship to Sodom and Gomorrah
To support a short order when I freak it on a corner
5-0 cruisin, decide to pull you over
Beefin, ""Where's the Coke?"" I said, ""A six-pack of soda?""
The rookie's lookin thirsty, but everything's mental
A baseball bat, to smack Shirley in the Temple
Agreed to meet the maker so I yelled Hail Mary's
And flew that head, to hit The House on the Prairie
But the past can never choose my future correctly
I found a greater source directly
On and on, keep it on, you chant the
Boppin simonized, pullin you clockwise jammie
To quickly skip the minimal tip, I dap for the wise I dip
Can anyone see, phenomenally, to the last degree?
I capitalize subliminally, wreck for positivity
Yes my little chickadee, ready to flow with me
Nevertheless I bless, follow me and see
Predominantly, CL'll be, All in the Family
God bless Marky Black, know we go way back
The lyrics I pack is like a needle in the haystack
CL and Pete Rock, smooth like Dom Perignon
Never torn, word is bond, we got it goin on

Anger in the Nation,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"""You know, nowadays it...seems like there's a lot of...

""Let's get together...and raise""

South Africa, what does it mean?
To burst the scene, or conquer like a philistine
War or peace, which one do you prefer?
Pass me my M-16 for the disaster
A reason for the treason in a jet black season
For peace, justice, and freedom
For the Original Man, architect of the Motherland
Kings to Queens is the Asiatic Black plan
Pre-Adamite, first to see the light
Way before Adam and Eve took flight
Bless the seed of Abraham, I came to jam
Protest the teachings of another man
Uncle Tom stay loyal so they boil
I'm the alchemist with the twist from the true soil
My blood brother Adolpho on the side of me
My vision ain't blurry, so don't even lie to me
The rebirth, the revival of our culture survival
To elevate, the black man is vital
You gotta realize now what we're facing
The floors I'm pacing from the anger in the nation
""Let's get together!"" * cut n scratch 2X *

Here's the situation from a darker view
Night and day, salt and pepper in the earthly stew
But the salt think it taste better, straight up superior
Therefore, the flavor of the pepper's inferior
Incorrect though, giving some heartburn
Level of a devil better wait your turn
And here is one recollection of imperfection
No one should be judged by complexion
Library, broken down as lies buried
To force their beliefs to pilgrims all hurried
Television, tell-a-lie-vision
A schism, negative realism
Four-hundred-and-thirty-five years til weak
Mental deaf dumb and blindness put us to sleep
Out of the dark comes light so the first can't be White
So Armaggedeon comes like a thief in the night
Rednecks flex to my context but in the projects
Some won't survive the next confrontation
And I'm aware of segregation
Pump your black fist for the anger in the nation
""Let's get together!"" * cut n scratch 2X *
""Let's get together...and raise""
""Let's get together!"" * cut n scratch 2X *
""Let's get together...and raise""
* various other scratches by Pete Rock for a few bars *

Some walk slow, 'cause the water's not shallow
Let my people go, you little Pharoah
Listen how they word it, be observant
Then: house negro, today: civil servant
I want to drop the bomb but remain calm
Strong like the power of the Fruits of Islam
Black is beautiful, hot like fire
Guess how many times they thought they killed the Messiah
Malcolm X, Dr. King, let's sing
All around the world let freedom ring
Reality is real, so how do you feel
From being kings on a throne to picking cotton in a field?
Your slavery is lack of identity
One of the things that's not making you a friend of me
What's your cause, aim, rationale?
'Cause I made up my mind, I never scrape or bow
But teach my own, the sound of black unity
Together we can rise and now's the opportunity
The Tuskegee Experiment, indeed it was big
When they used the black man as a guinea pig
Animalism, pumped on a lower level
But can only be the works of the devil
And I'm telling you now the frustration
The future's facing from the anger in the nation

Act Like You Know,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Here comes the hurricane, C.L. same name
Cut by the grain when I land upon the plain
Jah knew the Hebrew, a Papa Duke need you
But none of the fam who saw had a clue
Escalate the prime rate, words coagulate
Generate the mind's state, never can deflate
Nigga, you jigaboo, it doesn't have to be you
Funny like a cartoon, Pepe Le Pew
Pimp are the lyrical, g-string the individual
But the metaphysical isn't spriritual
Straight from the heart I frame the art
Tutor up my class, real fast, very smart
Dictate the technique, wait a minute, I speak
Loved by my son and a kiss on the cheek
Stutter-step the concept, blueprint, or pro
Steady as we go so act like you know

I stand by the rabbi, sail in Shanghai
Always had an alibi even if I lie
Crucial, never neutral, bare the fruitful
Past time, another rhyme, skedaddle, Yankee Doodle
Light skin in lovely gyp, just for the honey dip
Here to make a megahit fit
Don't install the pipe dream, renaissance regime
When you run ragged I pick up the steam
Chart on the record book, what Corey Love took the hook
Here's a new book to civilize a crook
Purest of the pedigree, feed 'em a line
C.L., no Jezebel, can never sleep well
Thick like a dred, at the Club Med
The Mecca Don said, a fish out of water is dead
Pete Rock, the soul brother, cruise on a flow
Swing low and yell ""Geronimo!"", act like you know

C.L. can play like Nike, come on just do it
Pacify the Gemini, soul into it
Pete to my beat is a rock like concrete
Hard for the street, the cipher never incomplete
A clean editorial, rather historical
Affordable, recordable, nifty like a portable
Mecca is the syndrome, when I come back home
Boogie on a baritone, listen on a phone
Libra, the achiever, toke a reefer
C.L. the girl pleaser, like Ebanezer
So here is the good sign, I incline
Titties with the bitties when I wine and dine
Warm like corduroy, comes the bad boy
But just like Anita, Pete or I bring ya joy
""Agoobilonians"" with your knowledge
And take as said so, flow and act like you know",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-act-like-you-know-lyrics
Skinz,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Uhh
Ahh yeah
What we talkin' bout? Talkin' 'bout the skinz
Skinz? Yeah the skinz, you know, girls
Fine women
Skinz, listen listen to my man

I hear it callin' never stallin' hit the skinz bed or shelter
Love to tap her on the shoulder, roll her over, then I belt her
Leave a bite when the joint is tight, lovely when it's loose
Produce the proper juice, plus I never hump a deuce
Give me the head on the waterbed, play you like a Pro Ked
Slide the flavors on the sled, listen to what he said
Come and lie on the bearskin, notice how the firm make him grin
Cover the checks and then I go cash em in
Hold the zipper, unlock, and grab the whole bag of treats
Hear the hooker slam the butcher with the biggest stack of meats
Take two hands to hold it, flip it out and unroll it
If you spot a brother larger then the next man stole it
Oochie coo now, you know the Mecca wanna bang bang
Beggin' a pardon as I knock a new skinz stank thing
CL, kickin' flavor with the Grand Puba
Speakin' on the wins, I'm about to hit the skinz

Talkin 'bout the skinz
The skinz
That's right, talkin' bout the skinz baby
No disrespect, just talkin' bout an everyday thing
C'mon

Nowadays I'm on some extra be careful (shit)
I take precaution, before I slide up in the slit
Man (fuck) that I put aluminum foil on my (dick)
'Cause if you catch it, boy that (shit)'ll kill you quick
Better yet, you can pass me a Ziploc
A bag of boom, and a 40 then some boot knock
I get stiff and it's hard like Charles Bronson
It's kinda (fucked) up what happened to Magic Johnson
But anyway, you know the resume
Time to drop the Girbauds and parlay, HEY
I rock the world of a 
big batty girl
Won't 
hit the skinz if she gotta jheri curl
'Cause when I jump into my thing I make the bed spring sing
And you can ask my old fling, who's the bedroom king?
Hit the skinz hard, she'll hang on to the bedpost
Then I drop my load, then get up and make some french toast
Run and get the paper and it won't be the Post
After that you know the flavor I'm ghost!

That's right, be out..
Hit it off.. on the skinz
C'mon, with the funky flavors
Uhh, gonna hit this off right quick

Hit the skinz they're forever wins, cozy like my Timbs and brims
But never heard a bigger limb around the rim
Set to hurdle when I pop a girdle, sum it up surgical
Lay down the pubic and the stuff won't curdle
I got the remedy for competition of any
Sleepin' with the enemy who never got a pretty penny
Skinz I'm with, check the lower lipped pal of mine
Now you know the Pete Rock, skinz all the time

Oh Pete Rock, raw as I ever been
Give me room so I can speak about the skinz
Take a tidbit, but God (damn it) can you dig it
Sisters play me close and they want my beeper digits
'Cause I love em undercover, the Chocolate Boy Wonder
Break like an earthquake, boomin' like thunder
'Til the honey dip the blouse, slip in the house
Sip the Stout, rip the boots, and I'm out

Like the Isley's, apply these, in-Between the Sheets
Follow yes another trail as if I had on cleats
Rip my way through a negligee, park it like a valet
Sure it's OK, just met the skinz yesterday
Tap the baggy drawers, lay the laws, lovely puff it up
For the ride, honey buckle up, smearin' all your makeup
CL can wreck it well a bombshell finishin'
So get the tunnel vision on how I hit the skinz

How I hit the skinz, uhh
It's fat, yes
As you know I like to flow
Don't try to show
Because I'm, the accurate man
Everybody knows it
Peace to all stealers
Of the Mount Vernon
Young poets and players
New Rochelle, the Bronx...",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-skinz-lyrics
"If It Aint Rough, It Aint Right",Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Above the level of a mezzanine, healthy as Ovaltine
The dominant gene clean, I mean go, the light's green
The protege could play like chess to quest the best
Confess, never poor as Bangladesh
I get busy like a boxer, operate like a Doctor
Seal like a locker, pop like Orville Redenbacher
Buy the tape, LP, CD
All me, and Petey, to cater to the needy
Like a Prayer for Madonna but A Different World for Jasmine
CL is well a physical attraction
Let me make myself perfectly clear:
While I'm there, I make a peer a positive pap smear
Really I do, once I light the barbeque
Thread the loose ends, see my friends are the crew
The fright night King of New York like Frank White
If it ain't rough it ain't right man listen

If it ain't rough enough, to mingle in the stuff
To scar and scuff and make you cuckoo like a cocoa puff
It ain't right so I smash the satellite
Check the Fahrenheit, before I take flight
Unique as Mozambique, here to freak Sheik
The skills that won't leak, and never antique
Warm like a oven you're lovin the style I'm druggin
Alleyway muggin, heavyweight sluggin
No fibs I kick the ad-libs and rock it in the cribs
Break your ribs like a toothpick cause you were never slick
? you lacked back when I first started
CL's the one who got the Red Sea parted
My conversation qualification is a doozy
The rude Rudy wreckin write you off as a floozy
I shoot for the moon, but even if I miss
I'm among the stars, to put a bullet hole in Mars

In my frame of mind I design the best-seller
For rougher cats can Rockafeller you're Penn and Teller
Steady with the convo, rough like Brillo
Let your head hit the bed and knock the feathers out your pillow
The master intelligent, with the black testament
Found it relevant, and mailed it to the President
But overall I get papes for my labor
With the physical manifestation of a savior
You wanna test this, but I slay anyway
'Cause your rhymes are old, with more wrinkles than a shar-pei
Mecca Don upon the streets of Babylon
Pass the baton to respond like Farrakhan
Hard like Shaft with the staff for the Backdraft
A blazin aftermath, so hon make a path
If you don't trust him, bust him
But if you don't have a weapon, then kid keep steppin
The main idea in here for the hemisphere
CL's here to get wreck for the year
A large man's appetite, blowin like dynamite

Can't forget New Roch'
Can't forget Westchester
Can't forget umm.. CL, hit me off

Feel the funk by the rap czars in sports cars
Comin atcha now you listen at the feet of a master
Caution, not Wheel of Fortune, here's a portion
Of untamedness, approachin famous, for miscellaneous
The track get crackin though, unexplainable
When I ground a jewel, sound is simply uncontainable
Release my soul, but never make the mistake
And play me like a stone cold fruitcake man
Cause you can never fathom G the dough we want so
My flow's the steadiest, to never leave us penniless
Come on down to the very necessary legendary
Well the more the merry stickin women type of villian
The evidence relentless, I ride to see you magnatized
Mecca to begin you're locked in no doubt
The label better push this, so we can pay the rent
You can season the pot well, but here's The Main Ingredient

Yo, The Main Ingredient y'all

Yo, The Main Ingredient y'all

The Main Ingredient y'all
Yo, The Main Ingredient, kick it CL

I know you wonder what kind of way is that to think:
Put all the wackest rappers on a boat and let it sink
Don't blink; next thing you see you spot is taken
No Jax I'm Fakin' soldiers took the whole reservation
On a scale of one to ten, we move rather swiftly
Want a dimepiece but we'll settle for an eight-fifty
Don't blow mine, your trump card is exposed to pages
Now your beginning's already at the final stages
Pumpin like 12 gauges from a shotgun blast
I never saw people run so fast, aight?
Stay up all night, then sleep all day
Makin big Lucci and would have it no other way
In conjunction, with the function, as stated
Orchestrated by the Soul Brother nickel plated
Tell the judge you were foolish, and try to be lenient
Cause you never had the The Main Ingredient

The Main Ingredient (7X)
Hit the third verse off kid

This cap is peeled layin joints like a minefield
When dynamite's my rhythm this is East coast terrorism
The Vernon-ville's Mecca Don, formin Voltron tactics
Let off three verses and the crowd panics
Get em all, the kingpin of the Player's Ball
Now every tramp in your camp's going AWOL
My Lucci situation is A Daily Operation
On the strip, I refine you like Tales From the Crypt
Right here's the real shit, and all that other's counterfeit
Funk to let you know exactly what you're dealin with
P-R slash, C-L smash, love to spend cash
For proper livin, slidin up in wealthy women
Stick your hand in my pants, and grab the mic's no crime

Cant Front on Me,Mecca And The Soul Brother,1992,"Ah, yeah, yes
Psychedelic
Uh, come on
This is what I like
It's that Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth stuff
Uh huh, yeah
Brothers can't understand
You know I'm about to drop a funky beat on you
Like this...
Hit the war drums that vibrate the earth underneath
Here my people and I come, gotta wake up the chief
Not a pale frail ghost, C.L.'ll wreck the most
'Cause the Mecca land never had a Leo Africanos
The Sudanian, master of the Mediterranean
And if it's lovely I'm the one you're Skypagin'
Lower than the Mole Man, R&B, you're silly
The only male hardcore cruisin' through my city
Rise to the supernova, swami like Bola
Heavy hitter I consider Uecker leanin' on my shoulder
Measure like a yardstick, thick at arithmetic
You add it up and I roast a high pick flick
Hit the pitch and then I'm gone as the funk lingers on
I don't publicize here to keep the black race torn
But steady at an altitude where you get the mental food
Not to be rude, here's a fresh pot brewed
Oh, what a web we weave when we practice to deceive
Sparkin' off a trick up the sleeve
Pete stocked the bedrock, listen and you'll see
And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me
Yo, you can't front
It's like that, c'mon, yeah
Yes, you know I got to talk
You can't front
I'm tellin' you now
C.L. Smooth and the Rock, c'mon
Many consumed what was locked in a tomb
That I gradually groomed, coming out now smelling like perfume
So take a whiff when I wrap a gift, play ya like a gospel
A logical apostle, colossal (whoooweee!)
Afro, a cut me like a fade with a Braun
Sport a bald head, but never needed Hair Club for Men
Drop a SCUD, fully-capable, a form in a eclipse
Skips to backflips soon as it leaves my lips
Suave, no I can make the funk turn to habit
Get the old 45 and I get busy on static
Welcome to the Ramadan, pilgrimage to Mecca Don
A prayer for the pair, Shukran, Afwan!
'Cause ain't no misbehavin' when they manage what you're cravin'
Put the ""Anger in the Nation"" on your station
Anvils that fills the whole circumference
And black people crowd in a mass abundance
To hear Gabriel's horn, blow it like a Naiji
What's the flavor unit with the top priority?
C.L., untouchable with the clip full
Impossibly, the posse can't front on me
Don't you dare front
Don't you dare front
Not on me
'Cause I'm the man
C.L.'s the rhymer
Right on time
Right on, my brother
Come on, kick another verse for me
You desire the messiah for the entire empire
Total organizer of the earth, wind, and fire
C.L. and Pete Rock unlock the hard rock
Many want to mock and the honey-dips clock
Intercontinental for the residential
Never coincidental, rough on a rental
Count all the bars numeric
Pro-prosthetic if ya let it resurrect the nongeneric
The brother on the cover, yes, a rapper not a singer
If you recognize him, point with your index finger
Shock another flock when I hit the block
God or Devil on the set that's level, labeled as a rebel
In retrospect I detect those incorrect
And reflect the black power project
Supreme 'cause I chose to never blaspheme
Going to the extreme, place it on a very high beam
And drop jewels for five thousand fools who stampede
'Cause the proper show stopper's what ya need
So come and get a taste of the dynamic duo
And I'm sure you will agree you can't front on me (Yoooo!)
You can't front, boy
'Cause we're the skilled fools (skibooze?)
We are the funk

In the Flesh,The Main Ingredient,1994,"The original, check me out on the track
Dead smack in the middle of something that's phat
The opposite of wack because I don't go there
I prepare a little something on paper for your ear
To hear, to press rewind one time
Listen to the beat and the extremely dope rhyme
This individual has, nothing to prove
As the groove gets thrashed in the flesh

""In the flesh""

Introducing funk from the yard, collecting strictly knockouts
The brothers I sparred, which only means the man got nothing to prove
On a power move made by the CL Smooth
Live for the '95 I arrive in person
Hard dialogue without a whole bunch of cursing
It's my prerogative, so back up and live, fool
As long as they don't violate everything's cool, cause it's all good
Understood is the smoothest daddy with the roughest raps
Am I thinking about blowing the spot? Perhaps
Carry straps on strips for the trigger-happy pirates
Where ladies catch fits steady reaching for my privates
But hold, how I unfold my whole repertoire
Now here we are to whole making of a superstar
With Rob-O and Dedi with the P.R
But nevertheless it's CL Smooth
""In the flesh"" (scratched 4x)

Rob-O's at the top of the list, so bust this
Stick to funk like Scotch, the top-notch vocalist
You don't stop, cause I can illustrate with the needle
Penetrating straight through the souls of many people
Is there any equal? On this path I'm innovating
Still faking, put down your pads and stop waiting
See the year of the fly MC is here
So stand clear, I'm facing the Gods with no fear
Rob-O, East Coast, uptown
MCing the most and spreading Mecca all around
Selecting the sound to make the party people hound
The DJ for more of what I say in '94
It's like that, so don't stop
It's like this, so God bless
Soul Brothers get down with no stress
Yeah INI's representing in the flesh
""In the flesh"" (scratched 4x)

Even in the mirror, it just doesn't get any clearer
I hear a funky beat and I gotta get nearer
KABOOM! Stepping in the sound room mellow
A dangerous flavorous fellow, hello
Style and grace, the original's in this piece
In the place right along with the pace
Nevertheless, in the flesh no quest'
The sess in the system, of course I'm fresh
I rest in the Villes, the skills advance
To a level of extravagance, the talent's all balanced
The extreme dopeness for the nation
D. is the inital, MC's the occupation
5'9's the height, light the color of the skin
Once the beat roll, my goal is to win
My friend the best, the real side yes
I rest my case in your face in the flesh
""In the flesh"" (scratched 4x)

Soul Brother supreme to catch wreck in the flesh
So check one two and a mic test
Now clear the room, I scoped you with the wide angle zoom
Trying to overstand my funk tunes
Coming soon, so chill, don't stress The Creator
I'll kick the funk loop from here to Cal Tjader
And cross the fader, and pack the lines on my paper
With rhymes so tough, who got the flavor?
Plus the knack to rock, I'm steady heating up the spot
The Chocolate Boy Wonder making heads bop
In flow motion, domes crack open like the pavement
Off some shit I made down in the basement
The funk ambassador, asking you to get with the pro-
Fessional, yo there's no question I can flow
Time to slide, you know the P.R. will provide

Sun Wont Come Out,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Open Sesame, stepping through the mist, it's the specialist
Coming to box, and flooded with rocks
We'll get down for mine, the kind that makes cement feel us
Standing in the company of killers
Follow my trail as I walk through the valley of death
Left, to fear no evil, cause what I grip is legal
I'm hot like yard, the point guard of this group, on the loop
Never your right, raising all your game type tonight
Entering the level of high gear
You'd think it took a Bob Marley spliff to get here
Front to rear God of the drugs that you're hearing
While my neighbors say we need to be jailed for rackateering
Now appearing, Pete Rock and CL Smooth to the jugular
Now you got Mecca and the Soul Brother
Slightly, you might raise a hair of doubt
But if we don't rock the spot, The Sun Won't Come Out

Check it out, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You know we can't Reminisce
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

Un-chained heat, I hustle on the street a beat
To keep you on the edge of your seat, you consumer
A QB-like Boomer
, the ultimate team
But if I wake up in another woman's bed, I'mma scream
I'm settin up shop pop to overthrow Castro
Chokin over 
Noriega's
 Garcia Vegas
Guess who supplies the pies and dope triples
Now she leaks ass cheeks, pearly whites and titty nipples
Would CL ever trick loot on PC?
Even if I never had sonny boy I disagree
Cut the small talk, 
I give more marks than a school of sharks
On attack, so keep your ass back
When it's wack you get a thumbs down, another record deal wasted
Listen man, find another occupation man
Here's the persuasion, blazin one amazin route that's all about
The Sun Won't Come Out

Yo, so check it out, with Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You can't Reminisce to T.R.O.Y
If we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out

I woo chicks off acoustics, 
watchin the Knicks
We up ten, we need to stop shootin bricks
Put the jailhouse funk in under stars
Til the lines on my looseleaf, look like some metal bars
My forecast hits a megablast, 
and what I invent
A pack of bloodhounds could never get the scent
Payin off the beast now my bills increase
If there's a five dollar rock sold in the park I want a piece
The Sun Won't Come Out, 
unless the crowd start this
Cause if it was my choice, you all dance in darkness
Cause any verse rips a total eclipse for sun rays
Anyways was the phrase back in my younger days (so check it out)
Now the God displays the attribute, dealin with heat
From the basement, enterin the streets you meet
Pete Rock and CL Smooth and when you see what it's about
You know The Sun Came Out, now pass my shades

Yo, without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Anger in the Nation
Yo, without Mecca and the Soul Brother
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
You gotta Act Like You Know
If It Ain't Rough It Ain't Right kid
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
We can't Reminisce
Yo, if we don't Straighten It Out
You know The Sun Won't Come Out
Without Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Without Ghettoes of the Mind
If you know what I'm talking about
You know The Sun Won't Come Out, so check it

One two, Pete Rock and CL Smooth for ninety-four
Breakin you off somethin proper
Check it, peace y'all",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-sun-wont-come-out-lyrics
One in a Million,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1993," (x4)
One in a million - fluke for you baby
One in a million - listen it drives you wild

I'm one in a mil and from the Vernonville
I work it out and wait to get curled
I'm here to sell more joints than ""We Are the World""
Flows and old bros and new foes are open and closed shows
So never doze attention, the Mecca's representing
The uptown jazz sound and the chicks start mingling
Now let's watch a flick by John Singleton
Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth is in the Mecca house building
Cause this funk is one in a million
 (x3)

Poetic, energetic rhymes that I'm droppin on ya
Justice, must this be hotter than a sauna
You know the boy wonder Mecca Don's got the soul
The black brother's in control now it's time to roll
We kick the flavor neighbor rappers when you need a savior
We're the two man band that everybody favors
Check the resume as we sit back and parlay
I'm on the job like the mob every single say
'93 no shorts, music is my sport
The hot metal's on my waste, brother here's a taste
In your face, 
the bass chillin like a masked villain
Nobody better cause we one in a million
 (x4)

You know the bump jump can damage your rump and dump ??? in a lump
And leap higher than a Reebok Pump
My funk style, wicked and wild and me you dial smooth as New Now
Many call this my Poetic Justice
So my fist can dismiss your hit list here's another twist
Listen in fact I brought my cheek's kiss
Roots and our loots and Tim boots the funk is ???
Now my sound brings new recruits, hey!
Mecca raw the more I toured to get my first born
It's a boy, now my name lives on and on
Whip a jam, fully aware that I can scare a cocky new pair
Slide em and guide em to the rocking chair
Up and away I'm trying to play the classics to today
Hip-hop nonstop, collecting ghetto props
Drilling grilling holes I feel because we're here to make a killing
Cause this funk is one in a million

Tell Me,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Tell me how you feel
It's time to get down and do this for real

There she lays, never the nonsense
The mood to watch her focus on and
Slide so she can ride the man who's born to be sextified
Study my flicks if only chicks knew the mix for better brands
When power lands the sister had other plans
The plot is set for her to wed giver her dad's permission
To marry the next boss in line in his position
Overprotective, the objective is never to leave her
Taking street, who pack the heat, now meet the Black Caesar
Bought her diamonds and furs, silky jammies isn't hers
But deep down I think a simple man she prefers
Every kiss was a death wish, every plan was a let down
Stopping in tears she pulls over by the playground
Clearing her vision, spots a game through the schoolyard fence
Sneakers squeeking, ball bouncing, looking so intense
And since her hobby was photography with nothing to do
Cool, she takes a flick or two


A couple of weeks go by, clocking the boys around the town
Her mommy shopping, daddy dealing, leaving night all time around
For her to execute her a level to break the family ties
To gamble her future on the love, murder, money, and lies
Watch out, the woman's about to love and claim her king
So she drove up in the ghetto looking to do her thing
Checking the brothers going crazy when the car skirts by the flow
I keep it real and peep it all from my window
So please, the lady's heading upstairs the first door
The second deliver my clothes, the third, run my tub water
Every way she represented made sense to me
When black is out of state, building spots, making lucci
The wind blows the candles, now the moon shines on my chest
But nevertheless I gently rest my head on her breast
But danger lurks in the wings based on how the cards read 'em
I think she'd better tell 'em


The blackest of the seeds to dawn stepping with two briefcases
Son you bless your people when you conquer like Hannibal
When I was about your age, I ran the numbers for money
I'm picturing him and John Gotti hanging in the study
I grew to be large in Crooklyn with your daddy back in the day
We were ready to take Harlem before he passed away
Women and booze, the weapon I choose then was truly major
I'm ringside with Don King when Ali fought Frazier
Scars and metals, when the mob settles I was flexing
My daughter was born so I called the X for some direction
Your father's words are like the Bible to black
But beware, he came barging in your room and you wasn't there
You let your mind wander, taste and face the search party
Left the grounds fully loaded with the tre pound
Then come in deep on the creep to find you and me
Cause you can't stop destiny",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-tell-me-lyrics
Good Life,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"Some live the good life loungin' by the pool
Catching a suntan and everything's cool
Male or female, you want to be set
In the big mansion drinking Moet
You read the Wall Street Journal
Later for the comic
Far from dumb because you practice logic
You lived poor in the ghetto
Never had the money easily
But, you found the remedy
So, you, your girl, and your kids can have a better opportunity
And teach them all about unity
Cuiltivate in the brains the word of Allah the master
And they go far
But, you still go visit your old stomping ground
Indeed to help another that's down
A tough situation cuts like a knife
In search of the good life

From the church, the home, on down to the prison
People want to know how is he and she living
Does he work?
Do you wonder if his life will bloom?
Is the girl going to have the kid anytime soon?
How's the mother?
Do they ever go visit the brother?
What about the dad?
I heard he drinks undercover
Some are still shooting up, another on crack
Just the other day trooper got sent back
What type of life do you lead?
Tell me
Cause you can be anything you want to be
Some will strive for the good life in any case
The mind is a terrible thing to waste
On drugs, violence, and hatred of another color
Hear me now, brother
All around the world the husband and wife
Work night and day in search of the good life

The G double O-D L-I-F-E
Living in luxury
Care free
Period
No time to waste
We catch ours all day
We work instead of play
I B-U-I-L-D inside me
Knowledge and quickly you vacate the city
From a paranoid mental delusion
Plain and simple
I won't cause confusion
Yo, that's your fault
Stop the somersault
Cause I put the bad like mo to a halt
My destiny I define is heavenly
So, Fort Knox, open sesame
Light shines and the birds keep singing
As I still cling to my positive upbringing
With the need to succeed, right?
On a natural high

Get on the Mic,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Capture this funakthon loaded by the Mecca Don
Into the red zone, you spot my skull and crossbone alone
To fill the Watergates, slaughter great, think and meditate
Set behind the pace of the CL's war face
Cars and tints, making blueprints for over six figure salaries
Luchified, cause many did and died
The mic wrecka, study Mecca, now building
Cause I love my shorties like Jesus loved children
Cause being smooth is the science I crafted
To a state, when they incarcerate me I wanna be free
And play some D on the high-scoring thrill from the Vernonville
Taking my yards with no bodyguards
My click's the first round draft pick for time in prison
So the only way to cover that is clean living
Respect given, hear the bell go ""ding""
It's like Tyson stepping back into the ring, soon as I...
Ladies and gents for dead presidents it represents
Now hear what it's like when I (get on the mic)
It's strike cause every Nike I wear is kicking ass there
Too dope to scare and too damn smooth to care
So flick your lighters in the air, and let me blow the roof off
The Colosseum plus I got to get per diem
All dueces file out, and leave the dimes to the front row
And when I say ""Go"" I want 'em showing love
And tossing dough, cause with the daddy unemployed
And the old earth raising me, any other rugged nigga's history
No mystery, I'm physical in action
So guess relaxing is a weekend with 
Toni Braxton
On your TV is me, incredible MC, B
With the P to the R, my break a ways can bounce for days
This fillets, 
I'm trucking jewels like Eric B
And all you corny fools can't see me, oh my my my
Healthy, wealthy, and wise just your size
Come and try the hardcore, set on down by every law
Moving in your Lex treks out a sextivity
At its highest level of funktagious served in major
He's the real neighbor, overqualified to be luchified
Pete Rock's the god when my stiz-ile profile
Slide into the Milky Way, the Carmel King's sing
We're back on crazy to put the duke up in Daisy
Amazingly, none of y'all can fade me never
Add the spice to make you shoop like Salt N Pepa
How large is he? Mastered my degree in mic surgery
With plans to retire at the tender age of 30
Power's what I cherish, all informers must perish
On the downlow, lift my peoples from the ghetto
In every bourough CL is quite thourough
In do or die don't try when INI",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-get-on-the-mic-lyrics
Go With the Flow,All Souled Out,1991,"(Get on up)

Yo', from the intro, I flow
Three in a row, buildin' like a Lego
Stacks upon stacks it attacks the wax
Scrub it like Ajax, relievin as a X-Lax
The night cap of rap here to make another hit
To undercover, smother, word to mother
Pump it for the playground, world renowned
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth is in town
I design a logical line a mastermind
So recline and listen to what's mine
I'm untouchable, lovable
Some try to imitate, but you can't make a double of
Me, the capital C, capital L, capital S
M-double o-t-h, yes
A pro, so you know
You gotta go with the flow

Smooth as ya ever gonna get to hear
Crisp and clear, so step to the rear
And make room for daddy, bigger than a Caddy
To move a crowd? Hm, gladly
It's all done with ease, past MC's
And all they feel is a breeze
The technician with the first division
Like a surgical incision, deeper envision
My flow the naked eye can't stare
But only hear another poet like Shakespeare
C.L. the swinger, ringer, clinger
And oh yes, you know, another hum dinger
Wreckin any studio, love to make cash
So kick it like judo, big like a sumo
Rhymes like a pro, so you know
Like a flute I blow, and go with the flow

I rock the microphone but you probably know
To hype the show I gotta go with the flow
And take it to another degree that many people wanna see
But above elementary
I made lyrical, any kind of material
More than minimal, for any individual
That I send, to reach the end
And just like Clark Gable, it's 'gone with the wind'
And take flight, through the night
Like a meteor, right insight to shine like a bright light
You gotta tip-toe from the get-go
Live in stereo, rhymes gotta flip, so
Pete Rock can move your butt and cut the strut

Check It Out,The Main Ingredient,1994,"We go back and forth, sending this out to my people up north
Tell 'em if you ain't from New York you're soft
Box or throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Cause I fight great, but wait
Here's the hottest joint on lockdown
Ready for release what they call a masterpiece
Covers are blown, known for keeping shit lethal
Cause now I'm like water in the desert for you thirsty people
What's the fixation with all this artillery?
Now you catch a look, saying ""Who are you to question me?""
Giving sighs from enemy lines taking care of my business
Is how you found out Wayne's World was never his
See my pend holds strong for all my cookies in mink
We call all types of bitches running out of ink
Later for ticky mind, avoid like suama
But I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind

You know it's my thing, get your bell rang
By the Meccafied slang, the jack of all trades
Couldn't even gang bang, and niggas can't hang
With so many styles, you'd swear the shit was out of Wu-Tang
But the samurai, CL Smooth I
Be slicing, dicing you down when the mic is around
I rebound like Oakley when you provoke me
This is the Chocolate Thai, be careful how you toke me
I razzle dazzle your fragile ass until you pay homage
To the man I plan is holding all the knowledge
In five minutes of funk off my tounge, read the label shown
Is it Pete Rock or Oliver Stone?
Still the same, they remember my name
Kind of reminds me of when Rocket Ismail played for Notre Dame
Invincibility with no vulnerability
Selling more than gold with the killers on my payroll

You'd better watch your step, known for the rep
Of being real but can't accept jealous brothers and others
Who can't relax with pep, and if it was the playoffs
Your ass would get swept and kept on stash
The Tango & Cash competitors bow
Cause I would think we all know who The Don is by now
Making loot at the pace of a horse race
Now once again my friend, the great paperchase
Here's a taste of life in the fast lane
Now house full of chicks, he's stripping off the Don P
With the profound sound, I ride swoops like a hawk
And can only bring the essence of New York
It's the Vernonville daddy, can you comprehend?
How some real live niggas set a new trend
Of being so blasted, smoothest prophets to the brain cell

Rotate the megahertz, where you heard it first
The perpendicular, said none similar
Quadruple any figure, quick on the trigger
Helter skelter, wig out by the goodfella
Not Lou Pinella cuz I'm black and mo' betta
Bust a phenomenum, we come to get busy
Deep in roots, but my name ain't Kizzie
Many many march cuz I'm heavy on the starch
Never tell a farce when I scale on a arch
Jammin' on the radio, brothers say, ""way to go""
Shape it like Play-Do, soprano at the Chateau
My theory periodically flows a odyssey
Bigger than modern technology
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat

C.L. is the attribute you salute
Cuz I gotta make loot, can't afford to be cute
Enter the equilibrium in a medium
Breaking your cranium with no ultimatum
Drop a psalm like a bomb, never land in your palm
And now I'm so cool and calm
Pure unadulterated, premeditated
Lyrical form, Pete Rock is the storm
Sophistication I kick to a nation
I rare compilation I call recreation
The prognosis, so mackadocious
Straight up ferocious for those who can focus
Large like the Beatles, ask all my peoples
Never make movies, so don't talk sequels
So, hon, save the chit-chat when I kick a format fat (it's fat)
It's like that...

I'm all sold out, no doubt, without a question
The blessing your guests in a suprucated session
Anyway your honor, heresay the melee
Is here for the payday, so A to the K
Or should I say Dedi, Original Baby Pa
Smooth like a reservoir, the funky Shang-Ri-La
No shame in my game, I'm set to entertain
And if it wasn't for the fame, skinz would never know my name
So back off a tad bit, that's a bad habit
Cuz I write the raw...for sure
Now I'm a flip a style and get crazy versatile
Never fragile cuz I'm flowin' like the Nile
Swing a jewel or a gem, notice how I say them
With my approach, smoke a rhyme to a roach
A four-season lover, light-skinned and bigger
But what I deliver come before the cotton picker
So here's to another hit, perfectly legitimate
When I hit the skinz, guaranteed to keep the candle lit
So save all the chit-chat when I kick a format fat

Job is done with the YG'z Menace II Society

And land your fucking asses in a coffin, what

Bullets are real, cock it back and then I peel off
Fuck the kamikaze Mecca is on the shotty hottie
The cops are running white chalk around your dead body
Abandon ship, niggas are ready to flip and bag a punk
They can't fight next night, twist a lism by your grave sight

Over, yes you over, six feet under
You sleep, I'm outta these, you're deceased
A reason for the treason, hunting season
Not for rabbit
I deals for niggas drinking beers lounging off block
Till the early morn', word is bond, another brother gone
Caught up in bullshit, quick talking with nines and banana clips
Vermilion with bloodshed, the color red, two to the fucking head
Man you're dead, Death Becomes You

""So listen"" - Slick Rick
""So bring it down""

Infrareds locked on ya heads here come the feds
Freeze now when I squeeze hot metal breeze
Right through your arteries to bring you to your knees
I think he's dying black
I got the track to send you silly ass niggas back
Snatch ya ho stab ya pimp and watch him limp away
I fiend Luchi till I'm fucked up old and gray
Hey dog I send you to the morgue
I'm from the Vernon ville blood spills shells drop
Because I gotta kill

When ya heard it go pop-pop
My Glock hit a nigga's knot
Cause I'm one of the hard akh's smokin' motherfuckers like crack rocks huh
So back up, be ghost when I keep my toast Murder She Wrote yo
Fully equipped with this death blow, flippin'
Because I'm on the level like the rebel crazy bodies and tombstones
Straight to the devil, nigga lay in ya bedspread
Because ya through from evil that men do
Shifty nigga Death Becomes You

""So listen to what we say because this type o' shit it happens everyday""

No resurrection with protection slay cut up in the blender

See the Mecca Don showing a tongue like Jordan
Anything you cherish I perish, I'm here to roll
And now you punks are pickin' lead out ya asshole
Gun smoke when the hood is broke and need the riches
Cause all this nigga want is more dough and more bitches

Buck-buck-buck-buck rat-tat-tat I'm on a mission nigga
I shoots to kill when I pull the motherfucking trigger
I'm sick in the head I'm crazy I'm fuckin' wild
I swear to God I'm coming straight from the penal

Worldwide,The Main Ingredient,1994,"Who keeps it methods unorthodox, who caught the props
Who's styles are shit, who's gonna rock?
On to the break of dawn, you wanna battle, pay the price
I'm mathematically precise, smooth and plus nice
With a flow that's like a mailman or letter carrier
Rob-O brings the ghetto area
Funk flavor through your neighborhood, state, town, or borough
Straight down, I don't fake I'm quite thorough
Not your average rapper (Listen)
Cause in a sec I write some shit to blast your wack ass to Mecca
See Rob's the most Mecca
To grab the microphone and yes y'all it
To school these dreds and stress these bald heads
That INI's in the house (You don't stop)
With Grap Luva, Marco Polo, Ras you don't stop
We let the funk slide and let God be our guide
Flowing from the Vernon worldwide

It's the funk god, taking you worldwide, so bust it
Flowing over beats cause it's a must, kid
That I proceed to fix the hardcore in the mix
Check one two with the flow that fits
I make the hits that soar, I put the wreck in the raw
'94 in your local record store
It's Pete Rock and CL, the Main Ingredient
Now leave your wack style home, cause you won't be needing it
I grab the mic and get wreck for real
You hear me on the wax, kid, you see me on the steel
Can you feel the funk as I inject it?
Then God protect it, hold the mic, see I select it
To keep it crazy versatile
But still underground, packs the four pound cause it's wild
In this place you'll find it hard to hide
Soul Brother and I'm going worldwide

Now who's the greatest? Few debate this, you're still figuring?
Well perish the thought, there's none bigger in
This act son, Mecca is all I attract
You're wack, son, yeah your talent's a fraction
While I'm nice, as Christ, is to religion
So envision a messiah on a mission, the competition
I'll stop your wishing point blank cause you lost it
Your joint sank, your soft style's exhausted
And now it's mandatory, you stand before me amazed and awed
Giving praise, yeah to God
Rob cipher's born, most Mecca supreme
A fly MC with the self-esteem
You keep it wholesome and still I relax a bit
I played your shit out, now get out, cause my wig out has to hit
Steadily encouraging head bops while you're scurrying to get props
I'm worldwide

Yo, check out the rhyme buster, pulling niggas through the wringer
I'm not a singer, as I conduct with one finger
It's the orchestrater, mutilator, master funktator
I've got mad flow from here to Asia
Cause I'll amaze ya with the skills that I possess
Not categorized with all the rest
So I suggest if you're in the way step aside
Cause Pete Rock is coming worldwide",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-worldwide-lyrics
All Souled Out,All Souled Out,1991,"Here we go
One time to the head
Somethin like this

Make way for the C.L. wrath on phonograph
Knowin the half, cozy like a bubblebath
Never said to be strange when I break and rearrange
A weak sap that's small as chump change
In the Poconos playin dominos
Foes who rose caught a broken nose
'Who's the Boss?' Not Tony Danza
Apart so Lorne Greene on 'Bonanza'
'Unforgettable' as Nat King Cole
Rough like a rodeo, hangin like a scarecrow
I get busynism, pump the realism
And just for the teacher or tutor I quiz em
Bonafied to eat you like Frito Lays
You can't faze and roll like the craze
Cultivate the mind, train it to teach
To write a book like Edward ??Shaw Keats??
Motivate the crowd aloud to get a response
Catch the mood of ambiance
No Ringling Brothers, Barnum & Bailey
???, played like a damn ukulele
Ahead of the class, so I break ya like glass
Have ya open like a surgery bypass
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out

Yeah (8X)

C.L.'ll get wreck in a millimeter sec
Kirk out, all hands on deck
Pick up the pen again, perp like ??Sanchor??
We're goin Warp Speed, raise the anchor
Rock a party so fly it's a sin
You bang on the door but you can't come in
So get a ???? like ??Rolo?? tomorrow
And if he turn snake just cut him like an avocado
Share the bread and wine like the Passover
Better luck than a four-leaf clover
C.L. Smooth'll kick a groove to a nation
Start from Genesis, end at Revelations
The tune immune and tap the fannies
Of Miss America and pick flavor panties
The man no type of woman avoids
Grab a microphone, blow it up like steroids
Enticin like lingerie
Had to lay Connie May just the other day
Explore like Magellan, shake like a gelatine
Can't be a felon, more seeds than a watermelon
When I raise like cattle for the battle
C.L. is prime time, go buy a raffle
A ticket when I kick it, clever like an ????
Masses and classes crisp and clear
I rock em, sock em robot
Pete Rock around the clock catchin wreck on the block
Playin more vocals than a Milli Vanilli
Shoot the gift with a spliff, but cousin, pass the philly
And let me get Brand Nubian, cold shake your booty and
Large like a ?????
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out

Smooth like Fabian, hot as the Arabian
Some will try but can't solve the equation
Take em down to the city where the boys act illy
And the girls look pretty like a philly
Rock the nurses, a quick couple of verses
No one curses, a king being the merciless
Read the resume first and I bet em
Paralyzin, hard to trace like venom
????? diluted ????? strictly be chillin
To play a better show on screen than Jack Nicholson
Ed Lovett International cuts my hair
A pioneer run fear here to Delaware
I got a 'Monie in the middle' for a playmate
A Spinderella/Salt-n-Pepa lover that's great
The unchained melody, sing it like Sarah Vaughn
Your ass is grass cause I can mow the lawn
Not a tricky-dickey lover that's picky
But hard nitty-gritty when things get sticky
I wanna hold a hump back like a whale
But you're frail and don't weigh much on a scale
The Tango & Cash, dynamic duo
Figure the one done so you know
Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth without a doubt
That's why we're all souled out",https://genius.com/Pete-rock-and-cl-smooth-all-souled-out-lyrics

Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?
Say what, say what?

The chef in one breath laid a dance of death
On a grill pursuin and barbecuin and groovin in skill
(WHOO!) Holla when I snatch em by the collar
See em starvin like Somalia
While you trickin stickin chicks up in the booty parlor
(Whoah) A lot of funk to make you say, ""Aow, C.L. how?""
Cause all I know is listen, can I get mines now? (Say what?)
In my verse brain cells burst so beep the nurse
For the knowledge cause the worst niggas talk garbage
A mean machine, to light it like kerosene
My cuisine is how David killed the freakin Philistines (uh-huh..)
Begin to sin, with the devilish grin
So me and my kin, can win and break bread when the record spin
(Yeah..) My love is real Ock, a lyrical buildin block
With incredible settable pure funk of Pete Rock (woo-WHOO!)
Forget the soup of the day, cause niggas are gassin
Well styles I broke smooth lotion down the ashy as hell
Got a rhyme so chunky it's amazin G
I make you think the Fat Boys are back on crazy (YEAH)
Major Mecca's in Asia when I date her
Some old flavor by the sun moon and stars and over the equator
Universally thirstin me to show no mercy
To madmen, the Devil wanna send (YEAH)
Word to life money ain't a rapper livin I can't run though so

Hah..

My lyrical fries today's tough guys, nigga
So box and throw rocks, fish or cut bait
Even if I was a lightweight, I still fight great (UHH)
I double em up and shuffle em down, combinate, stick n move around
Til you work me up an appetite to fight
Like a nick in the paint, think it is when it ain't
With no more restraint I make a frail opponent faint (OH!)
You need to get your ears glued to soul food
That makes you boogie til your nude and you never get rescued
(OW!) Now waiter take an order simply nothin shorter
Than the lamb to the slaughter recorder I'm flowin like water
(YES..) Since you're popular, I see nothin stoppin ya
From generatin lucci livin larger than Gucci, HELLO
It's Mecca's hour when the man is in power
To roast there (what?) I cook a medium rare, so toast
Perignon Poppa, my rugged styles vary; shit
I want a salary Mariah couldn't Carey DIG IT
I sport a blue face Rolex for thirty grand (yeah..)
Now take your family to go see ""Who's the Man?""
I wear colognes that excite your hormones
And Versace the wifey bought, now who woulda ever thought?
Word to life, ain't a rapper livin I can't run though so

I'm next on the menu, ""Who's the Man"" rappin? (uhh)
The hardcore for the dancefloor, no need for an intro (say what?)
You know who's the one, the man that gets the job done (yeah)
It's rare, the sound that you hear is so original
You can't copy it down, so let it be subliminal (AOWW)
You can't rock like the Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth (aw yeah)
Together forever, like G. Rap says, ""YOU LOSE!""
So pull up a chair and relax and let the music flow
And leave you on that note cause I'm read' to go (yeah..)
You gonna have a hard time tryin to run through me so

We Specialize,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Lights, camera, action (smooth)
The extra blazin' I push
Is like Moses talkin' to the burnin' bush
Face the furious meltdown of underground bugs
The kingpin racing all my thugs, hear
When I set the flossing overhead now
With the click that makes you die for the family and god
No doubt we're facing this and guard your radius
When I come with the squad, that would dead it instantanious
Arms grab me, out to kill and fail to force fire
Just to put me in change behind Bob Wire
Keep a strap on his lap, son the gate is fat
Bless 'em, it's done
The dragon make it for blocks, til you open up the safe box
For new Glocks my revolution is cold as every hour
My firepower is aimed at your control tower
True that, I thought you knew that
My swerve is out of hand
Introducing scatter black
My stiffness

It's on, hands of the pocket wanna gun slinger
The street linger holdin' the dead bringer
Poppin' your dirty finger
Scatter, niggas fear the mercenary corner vet
Deep like the projects, America's threat
Walkin' nightmares shots wolves packed
And cray burners and switch blades
Havin' brothers runnin' like slaves
The warning five, generate pies, niggas will die
Trap the lost souls in the game that we specialize

Guns for hire movin' keys of my empire

A Wolf In Sheep's Clothing and snakes that rattle
Plus your ultimate fear, is being cut down and babble
Blessin' with the team an' then get the creamin'
My bloodline is fiendin' to slay the demon
So what you want dunn? Tonz O' Gunz
Ho's most goes in addition
Rollin' in the crew for position
Damn to my terror the cruel love etcetera
Warrior, competitor a step ahead of ya
Fruitcakes front like you're from the penintentiary
Cause outside ya ""full"" inside ya ""empty""
Tempt me, to break your manhood and whip you like a mule
Cause the world has no pity for the fool
Meet the press, now don tell us really what it represents
Any man should die for turning state's evidence
Who you facin' the extra blazin', conversation
It's probably why they hold me in for tax evasion
Hold my click knock the bricks and my family-e

The crime iller for realer the hunted bounty killer
Trackin' something sinis'(sinis) then confess to your minis'(minis)
I want seven figures, we pull the biggest triggers
Or bring the lynch mob back and start hangin' niggas
With brute force I show no remorse
Break you off like sexual intercourse
Dig it, the connection
For you to start to pay me for protection
And make no mistake, we want all the cake
Do your pull-ups and dibs in the cool out
Muscle and buck with midnights strides
All my players start hustlin'
What you wait all the skill
And made you supplies
To buck these drugs we specialize

Its Not a Game,Good Life: The Best Of Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth,1991,"Introducing the Mecca fusion, physical type of funk using
Carmel cruising brother, your latest lover smothered for deeper cover
Ass blown to breaks, individualized the fakes
Just because you're pouring syrup on this don't make it pancakes
My vocal assaults kept bouncing many amounts that count slackness
Pete Rock's sounds of blackness
The dark gauges the flavor I supply
Now it's do or die, others are rolling the chocolate thai
I rip holes in sows, then move flocks of foes in straight
The Devil will find a way to infiltrate, never pray
I hear the scandal that be couped up in my town
So now we ""Gotta Get Away"" like Bobby Brown
The women will call it two letters that are instrumental
I focus my eyesight and run it down your genitals
Another dame when I tear it out the frame
Then armageddon came, it's not a game, it's on
It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)
It's not a game when the Mecca Kane lucifer knows your name
Now I think I'm on the break of black male growing extinct
Now my survival they label the label homicidal
My spirits aren't idle, now you put your hands on the Bible
Now the opposite of my God is Nimrod
Taught by Master Fard, hard, now I'm pulling your card
We travel, unravel, dabble in the dopeness
A jam that make you want to know who wrote this
A scripture from an odyssey, brothers in high velocity
And just like BDP, you know ""My Philsophy""
Yeah here to outlast it, to never see the casket
My flute can make a snake rise up from the basket
So Pete Rock here we go, master the flow
(I don't want to be the last to know)
With the mellow funk tunes arriving with the card trainer plain
The black House of Pain, it's not a game, it's on
It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor (Repeat 2x)
The lucci's mine like the summertime, and I'm a set it first
You leaving a hearse when my third verse loads up to burst
To blast, never to trespass, going to funk, keeping the crowd touring
The lyric is born on any stage we're walking on
So non-believer meet the Mecca, be chopping 'em like a meat cleaver
The scrambling quarterback, you know my the wide receiver
I get past you, and when it becomes a war
I go hardcore, matador, then all the bull is on the floor
I look and find the level of crime the time that I decipher
I'm bagging any sniper put a ball in Peter's Piper
We made the album of the year, remember the Source kicks?
We should have been larger but it's all politics
So (Why you wanna, uh huh, play your games on me?)
Cause you called me a factor, get your skully cracked
The truth is coming to take mine
You want to take away more stitches than a Frankenstein
In '93 me and the P.R. make the dough
The honeys are licking all over my 5 o'clock shadow
A menace to society, the pistol-packing YG
Mecca's the name, it's not a game, so don't try me
It's not a game, no, with the Pete Rock funk
When the kids up in the Vernon got the flavor
It's not a game, no, with the Mecca Don flow

* - this song has no title on the album
(Grap)
I am the one they call the G, the R, the A, the P and
I didn't write this, it's coming off the top of the dome
So what you wanna do and whatcha wanna go home
And tell your mama that I'm one wit all the mad drama
Yes I was causing the movies on 1 East 25th Street
I crossover, honey dips knew it was Harlem wheat
I was flowing on the place to be
Is being the capital rapper, the G-R-A-P
In the place to be wit my man Pete Rock and CL Smooth
Pass the bust a groove and the people begin to move
And get on the dancefloor
Got to move the funk you stinking little hores
And all the hoods and all the punks and all the suckers
Wit this shit I got stupid muthafukas
On my dick, what the fuk, I rock the mic so quick
Wit Adofo in the place to be
And my man Ross is right in back of me
Rob O, good to go
I've gots the F-L-O-W and that spells flow
Wit Chris Champ, oh what's up I'm bout to get amp
On top of the mic and I'm a set an exam -ple
Girls I pull, I got the honey dip, so what's up, my tank is full
Of sperm, I ready to bust a nut
What's up Pete Rock, come get on the cut
Rock to the beat, get wreck on the regular
Listen to me because I cause mass hysteria

The Basement (a cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ahh yeahh!! Feel the funk bay-beeee!!
That's right, this is called The Basement!
And my man CL Smooth kick it for you like this..

From the Heights, not what am I write, simple I can do this
Like Popeye to Brutus, I'm your host like a stewardess
Fly with the neighborhood hi-jackin fella
So prepare for landing, and crash into a cellar
Bodies in the buddha cloud, misty in the tune
Like a show all nights, a figure eight in a lagoon
With Pete Rock, the complete lock and beat stop
Now all the horny heffers wanna dangle on my *errr!*
Down by the dungeon with the cracks on the wall
Buffoon I'm like a mink while you're soon to pimp a raccoon stole
Vocal arrangement, ready set to hit the pavement
But not before the kid leave The Basement

The Basement, put the Funk in Grand
Here comes my man
My brother.. Grap Lover, get wreck cousin, c'mon

Call me the Grap Lover, yes, the younger Soul Brother
Keep your eyes on the prize cause you won't find another
When the funk is played, the rhyme I display
Quick to bust a ditz so don't slip in the way
Of the kid, with the flavor, the party people saviour
Clockin all the honies, eyes sharp like a razor
I kick a dance step, you're soon to discover
Yo, that's the kid from ""Mecca and the Soul Brother""
Yeah once in a while I be with CL on the DL
Or I flow with Pete, and find my placement in The Basement
The Basement, yes where the beats and the rhymes flow
Peace I gotta go, Grapster's out the door of The Basement

Of the Basement! Next we got.. a special guest
I ain't gonna tell you who it is..
C'mon.. rap along..

Tick tock tick, things are gettin - thick
Here comes the Heavster, and I know it makes ya - sick!
To see a black man gettin paid on the regular
Car with the cellular, fellas I'm tellin ya
I got plots and plans, pots and pans
Stocks and grands, so make room for the big man
I walk the streets in peace and I'm never strapped
But I know a crew of Young Gunz that'll send you back
So easy does it on the DL
Peace to Pete Rock, and the Mecca Don CL
Heavy D's on this track, lettin you know there's no replacement
Peace signin off, check one two straight from The Basement

Straight from The Basement
I'm tellin you now, kid
It's crazy fat
I wonder who this is comin up?
Fourth but not least, the backbone of the Wig Out
Freestyle, crazy hardcore, no sellout
Speakin, upon where I dwell from the dungeon
All over the U.S. states, even London
Pasttime present, black to the future
Swimmin in beats like a Dolphin, so call me Don Shula
A Raider well like Art Shell, crazy defense
A Pro Bowl with soul for local events
The crew name is CL Smooth and Pete Rock
Here to sail when I prevail and stare into the dock
The Pimp Daddy of the funk flavor, catch you later
Clever like a secret agent comin from The Basement
That's right, crazy funky
Aww my man
He's crazy funky, his name is Rob-O, check him out

Ali-kazaam, you'll never guess what I am
Motto is that nothin ever changes but haircuts and kicks
To stacks of vocal breaks life pays when
Kid said, ""Pete makes beats in The Basement""
Cold hit, the pavement, over to the chill side
The real side, the 7-7 hillside
I thought I'd just chill, take a breath
Straight up Columbus Hill, make a left
And get fixed, plus the ghetto chicks got flicks
Of me stacks of kicks, my joint's bumpin lovely
Walkin down the street, much props, on the ?
I hear voices sayin, ""That's Rob-O'Dingo in The Basement""

Ahh ha ha ha! Hah yeah! This is funky!
I can feel it
My man from the Vernon, his name is Di-da, make it raw

Fly like an eagle, a seagull
Always into somethin, like Snoopy, the Beagle
People, grab a tight hold of the sound
Hard, snatchin raw papes off the shelves
Blowin up spots from state to state
I'm comin to town but you just can't wait
Check the station, for conversation at six-block
Uno here, to put suckers in the mix
I get deeper than oceanography
Thinkin of crazy shit, like psychology
So speak the piece, then slide like grease
The beat is fat, but the rhyme is obese in The Basement

In The Basement, is where I dwell
Check the MC's swell
Cause I am, crazy funky, with CL Smooth
My man ?, Rob-O, G-R baby pah
The Heavster, my brother Grap Lover
