Sold Out Dates,UnKnown,2018.0,"Yeah, yeah
Young, young, young Gunna, yeah
Run that back, Turbo
Baby

Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

'Nother backend, I'm back on the road
Flooded Patek, paid off a show
Drippin' is rare, more this Vlone
Hoes by the pair, I'm never alone
Sleep on the Lear, Comme des Garçons
Drop eight in a two and let it dissolve
Balmain my denim, young GunWunna ball
Rock the whole concert and hopped in a frog
My foreign's a toy, I'm still a kid
10K this year for Coachella, it's lit
Rolls got umbrellas to cover her wig
Open Ceremony, left them in a trench
Lightning bolt diamonds 'cause I want revenge
We straight like a line, man, I really got rich
Some more fancy yellow diamonds in my piss
Don't get it confused, I'm still bangin' the six
New Cartier, Gunna a don
Niggas tryna soak up the drip like a sponge
Hatred's contagious, I keep me a gun
I'm focused on makin' a M in a month
Baby order twenty thousand in ones
Walk in and buy, I'm not asking how much
Red on the bottom, you need to catch up
Consistently droppin', I need me a dub

Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid
My jacket Off-White, don't mean that it's beige
I clean up real nice, I don't got a maid
An ape in the night, I'm still rockin' Bape
Live on paradise, I don't see the shade

Me and young Gunna back at it again
We just left New York, double datin' with twins
I just bought a Wraith, I retired the Benz
I fired my bitch and I hired her friend
I see all the hate through these Cartier lens
Every two months tryna put up an M
My dog caught a body, they got it on film
He still rockin' Gucci watches in the pen
Take a trip 'round the globe then we do it again
Got 'em watchin' my drip, guess I'm settin' the trend
Louis backpack, hit the jet and I'm gone
I don't post what I do 'cause these niggas be clones
See these diamonds they hittin', these VVS stones
Got a championship ring, I just brought it home
FN is plastic, them bullets like pellets
This Givenchy jacket, this ain't Pelle Pelle
Sold out dates, you know I don't play
The last eight months straight, got no time for breaks
On they neck 'til it breaks, ain't pushin' no brakes
I got on two watches, I still come in late
It feel like my birthday, I'm gettin' this cake
I pop like I got it, I'm holdin' my weight
I control the projects, I'm pushin' this weight
I'm sippin' this sizzurp, I poured me an eight

Sold-out dates, cash every day
I got you Hermés, I light up Blu-rays
This cheetah my pet, the condo a cage
Addicted to sex, I gotta get laid

Coupe worth too much, valet can't even park it

This is a Bentley, bitch, this not a Lexus
You beat me to the club like a domestic
I came to the club and they gave me a section
Hop in my truck and my truck all matte black
Saint Laurent trench coat, Rick Owens my jacket
Pull up, I Lam' it, No I won't crash it

Keep your strap 'cause these niggas play tough

New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't not one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs

Relieving her stress, I beat down her walls
Skeet-skeet on her chest, she kissin' my balls

VVs on my neck, I shine in the dark
It's easy to slip, don't want you to fall
Walk in with the drip, that Met Gala Ball

Shoot your shit up, I got accurate aim
Fucked up a few mil', now I'm back like I came
That boy say my name, I went and got me some strain
You know I don't crash, I just stay in my lane
Please don't compare, because we not the same
GunWun ain't no gimmick, ain't clownin' for fame
I trapped for a living and been had a name
Work hard for these clothes, cars, and watches and chains
Oh, man, Rolls-Royce got umbrellas, this whip for the rain
These folks done fucked up, let me slip in the game
This bitch let me fuck, this shit went to her brain
She know I'm a beast, and ain't easy to tame
She squirt on my sheets while I beat out her frame
Dozed off, woke back up, she still sayin' my name
In love with my life, and you wish we could trade

Came in and she strip, her panties and all
Lip gloss on her lip, suck me like a Hall
A boss and a pimp, I bought me a ship
I walk with a limp, FN in my drawers
When she talk that shit, I put dick in her jaws
I hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Hit and don't miss, ain't no win, lose, or draw
Came from Flat Shoals and Old Nat
On the South, in that back, you get whacked, then get shot in your car
Why hell you think that I'm maxin'? Relaxin' in mansions, no cappin', 'cause we had it hard
I ain't get this shit just from askin', I made this shit happen and passion, it played a big part
I ain't get this bitch off of mackin', it came off of actions and fashion and stay in accord

Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission

None of this shit came free, got it out the street, had to take a chance, yeah
Put the cake in the rubber band, stuff in my pants, I can do the band dance
Thousand dollar Fear of God Vans
, 
drip when I'm playing, just call me Raf stan
Of course they dig what I'm saying, another advance, smoking me a strong strand
Ice all on my watch, add it to the card, had to get the cars washed
Heated marble squares on the floor
The condo got a bar, cost me an Aventador
Yeah, punch in this shit to record
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Spot just got jammed on the North
Fifty bands to my lawyer for court
My spot just got jammed on the North
Fifty bands to my lawyer for court

I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it
Bankroll got hundreds and fifties
All too familiar, admit it, I'm truly committed
My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis
Back to back Maybachs and Bentleys
Shows back to back, my coupe paid off commission

Runnin' the sea on my wave
New two door coupe came with leather and suede
Fuck with this bitch 'cause she goin' both ways
Too much of this shit, I'ma throw it in bags
Not fuckin' you bitches from back in the day
My condo is raised, they dig like a grave
Gettin' in my bag and my family amazed
Gettin' out the hood, that shit felt like a maze
Gettin' out the hood, that shit felt like a maze
Call me your dawg, hold me down to the grave

I see you with it, I'm with it, my nigga, let's get it

My palms consistently itching
Served out the kitchen, relentless, we chasing these benjis

You gotta stack, you gotta grind
I'm statin' facts, these niggas lyin'
You can't relax and keep wastin' time
I want the racks, I gotta get mine
Stackin' it up, I work wit' a stride
I went from a deuce, turnt up to a nine
I sleep with the stars, I know I'ma shine

Same price as the rent, that's the cost for the kicks
I'm stackin' up racks just to make a hit list
My nigga El Chapo' will chop off ya wrist
Pull up wit' them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch
But I kept it solid and hard as a brick
Winked at your bitch, she want give me a kiss
Walked in that bit' I was drippin' like piss

Bought an AP, and took my wrist out of the pot
Pop a bottle of Aces, and pour that shit out
Put some diamonds and chandeliers all in the spot
How many racks does this young nigga got?
I flew to Dubai, I didn't go to DeVry
Hunnit racks to put the jet in the sky
Time is music, this the best you could buy
I'm drippin' bitches, niggas still think they still fly
I think I'm the flyest, I ain't got no stylist
I'm geeked up off Molly, I'm fucking on Cyrus​
I flew wit' a choppa, I might catch a body
'Cause I see these fake niggas through the Cavalli's
I got with my locs and we reunited
These niggas quote poems, and they bitches like it
I didn't turn a ho, when I got indited
If I catch a case, then I gotta fight it
My nigga called shawty, he ride with the shottie
We pull up in 'Rari's, these niggas don't like us
Smoke weed and sip lean and get money, my vices
My frienemies Poison and I know they sheisty
I pray to the lord and he know that I'm righteous
I need a reward 'cause they say I'm the nicest
Got too many bros, they gon' roll out the dices
I stay out the way 'cause niggas like mices

Put the dick in her mouth, and it's fuck what you say
Fuck the law, blow the police away
I blew a 50, 'cause I had a long day
When it come to money, I done came a long way
I fucked the bitch, but I can't go on a date
She sucked me loose, I put some nut on her face
Let her see the loft, she gotta fuck at my place
I'm steady bossin', bitch I'm havin' my way
Niggas in the trap, but can't get away
But I've been 'round the world, it feel like I'm tourin'
I’m livin' life, I swear I know your life borin'
Mama said don't stop, I gotta keep goin'
The house so big, the bedroom got an alarm
The necklace cost so much it came wit' a charm
The diamonds drippin' like the rain when it stormy
These niggas say that they lookin', well I'm finna' show 'em
So many acres it look like a farm
23 Million like I'm Michael Jordan
2 or 3 bitches, they wanna come join
Fuck all these bitches, I feel like a Don
I looked in the mirror, I know I'm the one
You ain't gonna shoot, but you carry a gun
Niggas act tough, don't want to bury your son
Had to stay down, stack them racks through the month

Belly of the Beast,Drip Season 2,2017.0,"Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see
And them bust down, got some diamonds and some molly on me
And I let her ride, she a dime, and plus I gotta dime on me
She a wild lil' beast and I'ma let her ride on me
Foreign outside, wide body ain't got no key
And we touring out of town, bitch say she never see me
Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast

Yeah, told you I'ma show you who I am
Touchdown, came home from jail
Still had dope on the scale
These niggas thought I would fail
Went and got a Rollie, Audemars (Audemars)
Keep the finer K like the fair
Sitting on some bands like a chair
And I was tryna whip some fish scale
You see me coulda sent it through the mail
Walked in the spot, had a smell
Shit was all white, looked pale
And I got the last bale off
I was tryna shoot but I was shell
And they say the lean help my health
Smoke the shit leave it in the air
And we'll never leave, we'll never fail
'Cause we the last real niggas left
All my young niggas real
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up at the spot we Dare
We ain't never ever care
We gon' cop designer every pair

Told bro we ain't take this route we was never gon' eat
Glad I made it out the jungle I'ma feast with the belly of the beast

Ayy, too many chains like a slave
Told my bitches behave
I'ma take this shit to the grave
You stand in line for the J's
I was tryna cop some new Ye
They told me Gunna Gunna you the wave
Now I'm tryna go and catch a play
And I hadda good day
Told my bitch she slay
Barber never gave me no fade
But a nigga down to catch a fade
Treat him like a meal, he a plate
I ride around with them snakes
And all my niggas gon' shake
All my niggas livin' off fate
I'm just staying down for the come up
And I'm going hard give it all what it take
Told you was no time to debate
Don't put me on the time I ain't late
Told you I'ma grind for the A
Used to get them pounds from the bay
Niggas better stay down and lay
On the fucking ground in your face

Young nigga colorblind, blue hunnids all I see

I pour up a four and I go outer space
Can't go back and forth, ain't no time to debate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
I ain't got no feelings, I don't feel the fakes

My plug get that work and it slip out of state

I moved out the hood, made sure momma straight

I cannot stop, I gotta keep going
I can't go off, I gotta stay on

We at the top and you niggas boring
Got with the slimes and I started touring
Jumped out the jet, went and copped me a foreign
Four Audemars, finna dip it in water
Go to Saks Fifth I might spend me a quarter
We shit on these niggas and shit on these bitches
My loc on Old Nat cut that dope in the kitchen
I'ma rap on my track, I done make a decision
It used to be Green but now we shop at Lennox
The lean on my face just to help with my vision
Handle my part and I play my position
I use my brain and I pay attention
I'ma sit back, chop up that work up like Beni

Look up at a boss when you talking to me
You know this shit cost I can't walk through for free
I pour up that mud and I roll up, get geeked
I heard he ran off on you niggas, you sleep

I bought the whole house, they didn't give me a lease
Run through the week make a hunnid at least
Copped me a coupe, it ain't come with no key

All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ah

Oh, Wheezy the wave, need a board yeah
You rich when you make it on Forbes, yeah
We winnin', stop checkin' the score, yeah
We can live with no warning
Spur of the moment
But it's war if you want it
Get too much of this money, buyin' too many guns, they treat me like a god
Too many keys to these exotic cars
Too many freaks, I been fuckin' a foreign
If you niggas fly then I must be airborne
Won't pay you no mind and they gon' pay me more
Hopped in the coupe, let the Tesla charge
I keep the strap 'cause I really be knownin'
I can't imagine my family poor
But I can see my mama in Dior
We walk inside and they closin' the store
You niggas ain't drippin' like Gunna the boy
Geekin' up and it's already a sport
Jeep and it's clanging, the engine it roaring
Fiending so much I don't know what to pour
In middle school when I jumped off the porch
Good in the hood, had to dodge all the narcs
I made it out, gotta live with some scars
Protectin' your family, you gotta go hard
The way my drip set, that shit come with a scar

Balmain jeans cut like a sword
I'm drippin' sauce like it's sore
I'm one of the owners
Car not a loaner
I want carats and pointers
I really fuck with lil shawty, I pay for whatever she order
My brothers get jammed, we cash out on a lawyer
Gunna always have your back like a spoiler
Some happen, I gotta look out for your daughter
You cappin', I'm rappin' my shit, you ignorin'
Saving the profit, our business is growin'
They felt sunny days and they wish for a storm
Fly in the sky, young nigga airborne
Wiring account, money come in all sorts
I really trapped out that Honda Accord
My chopper my pillow when I'm in the war
Blue hundreds my reason, lil nigga what's yours?
She tell me she cummin', I'm strokin' it more
Thinkin' that time we go big like the Hulk
Feel me, you thought I wouldn't make it at all
Get rich and I still gotta duck all the law
Shut the fuck up, I don't need you to talk

Still selling pounds of that weed
I leave 'em with the bro, when I’m goin' overseas

We can sip the lean, pop the X, really geekin'
And I’m rocking water like ice, I could freeze it
When your bitch land, I'ma book her at Four Seasons
Niggas hatin' on the kid for no reason
Gunna drip sauce, let her spring it like the season
Rockin' Off White when I’m walkin' in the meeting
A nigga flyin' kites down the road, they some demons
Nigga, stop caking that hoe, she a cheater
I only fuck her once or twice, then, nigga, I'ma leave her
I tried to pop a Percocet and pour me up a liter
I drop a fishscale in a bowl, let it heat up
Chanel on, still can’t see us
Nigga, send 'em back, countin' money with my feet up
I been sendin' racks to my cuz on the kiosk
I'ma send that pack down the road, 'til you get out

Hundred thousand worth of ice in my Louis bag
Saint Laurent, kickin' these bitches like “Who that?”
Rich nigga came from the hood, but you knew that
Ice on my neck, it look like a sleet
Plain Jane band on an iced out Patek
Don't cuff that hoe, she a freak
I’m up gettin' money, don’t know how to sleep
I fucked that lil' bitch and I fucked up the sheets
Ice all over me like I was a Christmas tree
Mind on a milli', ain't thinking 'bout enemies
Shoot a nigga down like J. F. Kennedy
Sellin' chickens, you can come get a 10 piece
Jumped out the plane with the Fendi
Jumped in the foreign with the semi
Baby Draco hold a 50

Stunk up the whole house when I broke down a P
Got mine out the streets and I brought home a feast
I do it for my fam, I don't just do it for me
When I took a loss, man that made me a beast
The car in your name, but that shit still a lease
They'll let niggas pop but don't pop shit on me
I'll cut your shit top, leave your brains in the seat
No more baby bottles, we pour out the pint
I bust in her mouth, flew her back to the bay
That Wraith make me feel like I'm floating in space
I went to Old Nat now I'm back in L.A
I still got that Rolex to keep up the day
Gon' shine on these hoes like the middle of May

Before hit the awards, man I pop me some molly
That shit was so pure, had me itching and rocking
Then poured up some Tech, had me leaning and scratching
And a half of a Xan just to help me relax
And I pulled that lil' ho she was from Calabasas
Don't know her real name but she looked like that action
Took her to the room, we couldn't go to the mansion
And then dropped her off with my locs who on Stanton
Stunting that bitch must've thought she was Kourtney Kardashian
I hit and I run like a muhfucking accident
Pulled up to the spot, don't see nun' but some packages
And I got some Sprite finna mix 'em with Actavis

Bang yo shit out with the accuracy

Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah
And I came from out that jungle, I'm gon' eat when I get hungry
Had my back against the wall, I had to face off my opponents
If I trip or fall or stumble, I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it

Money talks, my favorite conversation
I fuck that money and give it penetration
Private flight came with no invitation
When it come to paper I had to practice patience
Had no transportation, had to use the Marta station
Now we ride in spaceships, inside of the coupe it's spacious
On the jet getting faded, flew out the whole crew to Vegas
Smells like we make it, racks so long from here to Macon
Stood out on these niggas, I'm so outstanding
Had to get rich, couldn't do that shit without planning
When you take a fall nigga don't panic
Gotta give that shit your all, bet you don't fail it

I'ma grind, get this paper
I'ma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah

If I trip or fall or stumble, I'm bouncing back and getting back on it
Get that check up every morning, gotta get it if you want it

Told all of my bros we gon' be on
Told myself I had to make this shit just on my own
When shit got real, I still had your back when you was wrong
When we get Ms, I'm gon try to bring my nigga home
My Rosetta Stones, nigga sit me on a throne
I just got a dome, then I left that ho alone
I'm just tryna grind, make a million worth of songs
Cop a Patek for my mum, she gon know her son the don
Got that AP on I feel apologetic
When I fell in love with money that shit was so romantic
Get them racks and cuff 'em, hide 'em in the attic
I done got so high, I done forgot I had it

I'ma grind, get this paper
I'ma shine on a hater, yeah
Build a mine, I got acres
Diamond ring, I go glacier, yeah

I'm tryna pave the way

Hopped on the interstate

Come from where they kill and take

Shoot out in broad day
We takin' all aim

Lean is my bombay
I promise I'm putting Chanel on my niece

New sixty-three, AMG
I'm a little 'head of my speech
I'm in the need for speed
I got this beat from Wheezy

It's a new drippin' season
I had to be the reason
Girl what I said I mean it

I'm not eating lo mein
I know it's a cold game
I'm still rockin' Balmains
I'm tryna remain sane
Buy platinum and gold chains
I smoke out a whole thing
Pour out the whole pint
The spot white as Colgate
You just missed your ho, you too late
I don't really care what you think
I'm in my own lane
I'm poppin' my own mane
It got me a long way

Bitch looking fly as hell and don't take pictures
Nigga get out of line, a nigga hitting
My bitch is fine as hell but she don't listen
That's why I fuck the bitch and then dismiss her
I want blue cheese only
I ain't rocking no Saucony's
Gunna gon' be the first one to own it
That shit is out of season I don't want it
I got my britches, how 'bout Ferragamo?
I got some choppers, 'bouta buy more ammo
I'm tryna catch a nigga, I ain't a scammer
I'm in New York and I feel like the panda
Promise I won't let up
You a pussy nigga, nigga shut up
I think these bitches dig it like a shovel
I got my cheese chip, I'm stacking cheddar
God I made it out the ghetto
I cannot lie a nigga living better
That Rover came with two umbrellas
White and black seats, I call 'em salt and pepper
I'm a rockstar, I'm toting heavy metal
Hit the gas and press the pedal
Nigga can't get no service, ain't no data
I'll cop another car, you make me madder
I could keep getting money, it don't matter
You don't like what you see then change the channel
Cause I'ma keep popping shit on every camera
Gunna Gunna with whatever

Come where I'm from, gotta keep a gun nigga
Cause the young niggas gon' ride
Nigga can't run, nigga you can't hide
I come from where the young niggas die
Go get a bond nigga, flip a pot
Break down that bond nigga, make a lot
Niggas ain't real, niggas never lie
Your brother get killed nigga, and you gon' cry

You can't get what I got
I ain't no pussy, I ain't someone to try
Nigga can't take the chain or take the watch
Nigga a ghost of Gunna blow the spot
See the real in my eyes
Nigga ain't put my pyrex to no side
I'm from a mob filled with ties
She fuck me cause she like my vibe
I copped the car then I chopped the top
She want me raw dog but I'm not
I feel like a star when I'm walking out
I shoot you like Paul Pierce, I got a shot
You still playing hard, nigga need to stop
My nigga never seen the drought
And Troup like a guard living on the south
I come from where them bodies drop

Come where I'm from, gotta keep a gun nigga
Cause the young niggas gon' ride
Nigga can't run, nigga you can't hide

Make No Sense,Drip Season 2,2017.0,"Told you we was gon' be rich

So much money don't make no sense

Make me wanna cop that Benz
Ride around the town with no tint
Cash in the bag we lit
Smashed and then got in that 'Vette
So much money don't make no sense
I ain't got no friends
Tom Ford all over my lens
Got racks in my pants

Got steel like Pakistan
I flew 'cross the map again
Got shows and I got fans
Gotta count them racks again

I ain't hide my safe in the attic
Smoke weed, sip lean, eat molly, pop xan bitch
Please don't panic
Got a Glock 19 black matte
Gotta ride with that static
Lil Duke with a iced out Patek
YSL getting green like salad
Gunna got a flow, can't get it
Fucking on all these bitches
My diamonds wash all the dishes
You niggas can't reinvent me
Pull up in that foreign, foreign, foreign at the Weston

Sipping on lean 'bout to fuck up my kidneys
Since a young nigga, been getting it
Quick to turn 10 to a 20
All of these bad bitches they on my dick, I got plenty
Selling out shows and winning
This foreign on me got tint
Riding with a bad lil' bitch
Hop on the highway, she suck on my dick
Diamonds on me and they looking like piss
Mama I told you that we gon' be rich
Gotta keep it real and can't ever switch
I had to stack up my chips
Stuck in the streets, came up off a lick
I had to stay down, stay in my own lane
Mama she told me, ""don't go against the grain""
Knew what I been through, you can't feel my pain
Keep it so real that shit run through my vein
Made myself a boss and made me a name
Work in the trap, make the trap go insane
And ain't a damn thing changed, ah

She say she wanna fuck and suck me with no strings
Leaning on the X tryna balance it with weed
Think about flying to Belize
Take a nigga bitch and I let her fly with me
But I will never ever ever let her get between

New lights on the Benz looking cock eyed
On the southside
In the coupe sippin' lean, eating Popeyes
Got a Glock

Shit'll get hostile
Make a nigga her star
Any given time and
Rolls Rolex not the Timex

I ain’t tryna sign, I'ma stay independent
Now open your eyes, hope you pay attention
I copped me a coupe and it come wit' no ceilin'
I used to struggle 'til I started dealin'
I gotta hustle to get me a million

Try to avoid and roll me a spiffy
But these niggas tellin', I smell somethin' fishy
I can't sell a brick 'cause I think it's too risky
If I sell a bale they might try come get me
I'm still gon' pour bale and my shit cost a milli's
Wake up in the mornin' and think about Benji's

Turn the beat up
Yeah, yeah yeah
They gotta hear you out there
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I ball like a pitcher, I'm so superficial
I fuck with my niggas, spend a check on my niggas
I'm stackin' residuals, pullin' up 'bout my issue
Droppin' hooks like a fisher, tryna see me some figures
I lust how I'm feelin', got my mind on a million
Think it's smoke like a chimney, niggas plottin' and envy
I wan' feed all the children, 'member times I was miserable
Niggas try to belittle you, man I let 'em get rid of you

I'm hot like a fever, I got ice like a freezer
That pussy a pleaser, told that bitch I don't need her
I got more stripes than Adidas, pour that syrup, I'ma drinker
Drop a four in a liter, Backwood filled up with reefer
Drop a lil cash and tease her
I treat these niggas like 
Niggas are fakin' and they change like the season
I stack that check, stayed the same, that's the reason
Diamonds just hang, that bitch blangin' and blingin'
Sippin' on Ac' and high-tech, we still leanin'
No more regrets, we live life with a meaning
Pockets ain't light, spent a check inside Neiman
I'm tryna make billions, you fool
I know I'm bigger than you
'Bout that bag we don't play by the rules
Ain't goin' out, I ain't been in the mood
Take a swim in the infinity pool
Got a whole lot of shit I could lose
Can't let none of you give me the blues

I ball like a pitcher, I'm so superficial
I fuck with my niggas, spend a check on my niggas
I'm stackin' , pullin' up 'bout my issue
Droppin' hooks like a fisher, tryna see me some figures
I lust how I'm feelin', got my mind on a million
Think it's smoke like a chimney, niggas plottin' and envy
I wan' feed all the children, 'member times I was miserable
Niggas try to belittle you, man I let 'em get rid of you

Man, I let 'em get rid of you
Know your own folks don't wan' see you irrelevant
Nigga I'll crush your whole shit like a elephant
Pass me the Rollie, I feel like the president
'Member I ain't have my own pack, had to mail in it
This shit get you high then you know I was sellin' it
I got one foot out but I'm still dodgin' felonies
I'm gon' free my , we appealin' it
, now I gotta cap off a brick
Got racks on me, swear I'm a walkin' lick
Said I wouldn't stop when they thought I was talkin' shit
Keep spillin' the drip and then droppin' hits
Ballin' these bitches 
Walkin' that shit only I could pick
You niggas fake, I'm the opposite
YSL slime and I bang the six
I'm 'bout to make a set
If I spend a check, I'ma make it back
Beat up that cat like a maniac
No running back, got a running back
If I let 'em  what's the fun in that?
I'm tryna see who he gunnin' at
Pull up with that cutter, no lumberjack
Three stones in my ear, don't hear none of that

I ball like a pitcher, I'm so superficial
I fuck with my niggas, spend a check on my niggas

Watch me pull up in that white and grape Wraith
These niggas hate that's on these nigga's fate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
We keepin' them flaws and we know that you fake
Riding with Gunna, Draco like Osama
We ride behind 10, Presidential Obama
You dissin' fire shit then we shoot up your Mama
I got them bales coming in by the bundle
Takin' the top floor to condo
Gave the bitch 500 just to score
It ain't nothing to me 'cause I get me some more
200 around the corner in the 'Rari

Hit the Pedal,Unreleased Songs,2019,"Yea, uh Southside

I want some Ms, nigga, I can't settle
Got me some Gs covering up my sweater
Hop in that Benz, watch how I hit the pedal
I spent me a ten, got me lookin' better
I told all my friends ""Promise I won't let up""
My cousin in pen' still sendin' letters
I told her I'm movin' momma out the ghetto

These Balmain jeans also met Margielas
I stuffed them with racks, it got these niggas jealous
Maison my fragrance, know you bitches smell it
Still dodgin' cases 'cause these niggas tellin'
Just come by my way, know these niggas ready
Sleep with that K like I come from Bel Air
Still get some percs from my grandma Betty
Vlone Air 1s, these here come from Nelly
They tryn' bite the style, know you gon' regret it
Yung Gunna, Southside, nigga, we done did it
I'll catch you outside, make you start repenting
Make me go live, get you some attention
We split down the pies, turn it to division
A bunch of bad guys playin' they position
I can look in your eyes, know you wasn't with it
You stack them racks high, nigga, penny pinchin'

I want some Ms, nigga, I can't settle

Movin' momma out the ghetto
I'm 'bout to go take my talents out to Cali
I just might move my momma to the valley
I just wan' make her smile and see her happy
You thought she was loyal 'til she sent the addy
I fucked her twice, she sucked me, did the nasty
I will not cuff 'em, play 'em with a passion
I'm not like these bucket hats, these niggas cappin'
I grew up hard, had to make it happen
Had weed in my jar wrapped inside the plastic
Used to pull up and park, nigga, just start trappin'
Said I do not pause, nigga, just start rappin'
That nigga come to bargain, nigga, beat it
I drip when I walk in like I'm sweatin'
This bitch love a boss bein' in her presence
You know we ain't talkin' to no peasant

I want some Ms, nigga, I can't settle
Got me some Gs covering up my sweater
Hop in that Benz, watch how I hit the pedal
I spent me a 10, got me lookin' better
I told all my friends ""Promise I won't let up""

In the Lamb', I do the dash, I'm pushin' these Balmains on the pedal

Take my shoe  on your pedal
Put my diamonds in a  look like stupid pebbles

Контроль процесс
На глубине
Но всё это бред (who)
Я всё так же зависим от всех этих сцен

Привык ценить момент, хоть и знал что конец

Как ты можешь говорить за людей
Если ты ещё себя толком не понял?

В открытом архиве, но я не леджит
Боевая машина - мой пульс дребезжит
Тег с шестеркой в начале - это мой shit (грр-ра! па! па!)

На них сюр и грязь образуется
Контуры граффити как магистрали, кварталы на карте рисуются... (йе-е)
