Beat Street Breakdown,Beat Street (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) - Volume 1,1984,"Beat Street Breakdown
, rrrrhaa!
Beat Street, the king of the beat
You see him rockin' that beat from across the street
And huh-huh, Beat Street is a lesson, too
Because ah, you can't let the streets beat you
Uh!
Well, a picture can express a thousand words
To describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over
I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colors would swirl
And the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand
As far as the eyes are able to see, ha
I never knew art till I saw your face
And there'll never be one to take your place
'Cause each and every time you touch a spraypaint can
Michaelangelo's soul controls your hands
Then serenades of blue and red
And the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo colors playin' tunes
Man why oh why you'd have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Where the good die young is all thy must
'Cause as life must live death must die
And the tears shall fall from the living eye
Huh, teardrops fall for the state of mind
Of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead
And she still can't get you out of her head, huh
More tears fall for all you've done
Tried to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed
Put a shirt on his back and a roof over head?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream
Of the beautiful cities and the islands and streams
When your works of art brought into being
All that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the street
Abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are sellin' that body
And everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hangin' out tough rockin' late at night
Runnin wild in the town of the neon lights
You either play some ball or stand in the hall
Huh, you gotta make somethin' out of nothin' at all
I'm sittin' in the classroom learnin' the rules
And it says you can't do graffiti in school
That can't be wrong in the hallowed hall
So my notebook turned into a big wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three
And the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
'Cause I'm caught in a rat race lookin' for my own space
It gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky and a eye for a eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweatin' from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, it's, huh, just us
Still life urban masterpiece
Your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released
Huh, and yet you got killed for nothin' at all
So after this there'll be no more hard time
No more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you hip-hops, get on up
And let's take it to the top where we belong
Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now come on
And say hooo (Hooo)
Say hooo (Hooo)
And to let me know I'm rockin' the microphone
Everybody say Ramon (Ramon)
Ramon (Ramon)
Rrrrhaa!
A newspaper burns in the sand
And the headlines say 'Man Destroys Man'
Extra extra, read all the bad news
On the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire
The sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibies
And the foolish attempts to conquer the sky
Lost in space, and what is it worth?
Huh, the President just forgot about Earth
Spendin' multi-billions and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran in the zillions
There's gold in the street and there's diamond under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're livin' like mice
And their houses even make the ghetto look nice
Huh, the water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
A people shout out in the darkest hour
Sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused
Huh, minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lices, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothin' is sacred and nothin' is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Hitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan
Napoleon, Castro, Mussolini, and Begin
Genghis Khan and the Shah of Iran
Men spill the blood of the weaker man
The peoples in terror, the leaders made a error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
'Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
So learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
'Cause the children of Man inherit the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Rrrrhaa!

Step Off,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1984,"Chrous:
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get
 lost because you know you're soft

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the 
be-bop
 swing
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear
See, before my reign, it was the same old same
""
To
 the bop with the bop"", that street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is dowwwwwwwwwwn!
(Oohweeoohweeoohweeooooooooooooooooooooooohh
Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water, my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
Cause anything you wanna do, I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And 
tricks are for kids
 so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I buy a mansion for my mother
The 24/7, 
the Kool-Aid smile
Say, ""
Headcrack
 eleven and look at my pile.""
(Repeat chorus)

Come on
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good
Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand
One girl at a time gettin' MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away
You're right
There is no diff' between me and you
Except I look good and you look through
Take that
(Repeat last two lines of chorus)

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds
But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity, the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the words of the master teacher
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why we're gonna get everything we want
Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense
See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio
Kami Kaze, Clayton Savage and Eazy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop
ROCK!
And not only that
(Repeat first four lines of chorus)

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the country that was overseas
Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, y'all, all night long
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said
""
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
."", I said
""Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said
""Let me me rock you cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you wanna do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you, Chaka baby, cause my name is Melle Mel.""
(Instrumental break)

Say what, y'all
Say what
To the DJ scratch, you met your match
Cause we're comin' out fresh with a brand new batch
So takin' you off into the galaxy
Is Vicious, Vicious, VICIOUS LEE!

Pump Me Up,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1984,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle
There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you
Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew
The shark got sick and then he exploded
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me
Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel
And to all the fly girls I come off hard
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge
Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat
I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you
Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker
The microphone champ
Got a knock out voice
Like a rolls royce
Gotta rank as number one
To be the people's choice
Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle
Up above your head is the flash of light
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train
The train to the bus the bus to whatever
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother
Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night
Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud
And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women
That give me good love in the beginning
Bubble bath and candle lights
And girls saying Scorp you alright?
So stop standing there like you from above
And just relax yourself and get in this tub
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up
For all you beautiful people out there
If you having a good time, everybody scream!

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel
And to all the fly girls I come off hard
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge
Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat
I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup
Cut the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew

We Dont Work For Free,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"In the darkness of night, huh!
All the stage lights are shinin' bright, hey!
And we work very hard, to make you stay, rah!
But it ain't no thing y'all
'Cause I know that you can hang
We're not too expensive but you got, to, pay, rah!

Some say the money it's the root, of all evil
It's not the love, but lust of it, that makes men greedy, oh
You said, ""You wanna go for a ride? You gotta pay the fare""
So stop!  You ain't got no money, you ain't got no beat
Whoooooh, say you
""Got no satisfaction, won't you come and work for me?""
And I say to you
""Can't you see baby, we don't work for free""
You know you gotta live, but shit, they give you stuff for free
Man, these times are hard, hey!                                                            And don't nothin' come easy-hee-ee, yeah

And I say to you
""Can't you see baby, we don't work for free""

Finance, city life
You gotta work to afford paradise, huh!
But if you livin' in a glass house
Don't throw no stones, rah!
Slave, trade, don't get laid
You gotta get paid, if you wanna go places
Where you've never been before
Ok baby, rah!

Where you been before, don't matter with me
Better save your pennies, nickels, and dimes

Hee hee hee, hee, haoowww, we don't work for free

The Truth,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"Rap is our way of life
That's why we do what we like
Born to rock the mic
Like E F Hutton
So don't say nothin'
Just listen

Yo, yo, I am the man called Scorpio
The one that's seen and never heard
But, all my sons just running their mouth
So, it's time for daddy to speak his words
You see, the biggest problem about all the MCs
Is I look good and they are ugly
While they always gettin' together saying I'm not cool
Their girls are out being my fools
'Cause I'm the first attractive exotic male
To walk around town with beads in his hair
To be stopped on the street by the people I meet
Saying ""Where you get your beads, 'cause you look so sweet?""
Hey, for any fellas that think I'm gay
I pull five girls right in your face
I'm not saying that I'm the playboy king
'Cause I didn't make it up but I made it swing
I spend more on spice than I do on clothes
So how could they front that they got gusto
There just barely make enough for a gram of blow
To start hoping and praying for their next show
But a brother like me, could rock it all day
I'm much smarter than that, in my own way
And you know what I'm saying is an actual fact
'Cause my Mercedes outside, where there's at?
(Born to rock the house!)

Hey, check me out while I roll my game
There's not another MC can make me feel shame
My name is Cowboy, not given no slack
I'm like 4-5-6, better known as headcrack
I've been rocking that party eight years of my life
Got shot with a gun and stabbed with a knife
Had to pay my dues, had to learn the rules
Had to separate the smart from all the fools
People talk behind my back and never to my face
But they make a clear path when I step in the place
I can make them clap their and hands and stomp their feet
Make 'em party to the rhythm seven days a week
Make 'em shiver and shake, just like a earthquake
Make the people dance, without a mistake
I can cruise around the world, all accross the nation
Get a big kick out of crowd participation
Make them hip to the hop and all that stuff
'Cause the other MCs know I'm just too much
My eyes are brown, my legs are bowed
I can tell a MC right where to go
I can get a young lady with the wave of my hand
I can stretch out long like a rubber band
Saying one for the treble and two for the bass
'Cause I'm Cowboy, to put a smile on your face
(Born to rock the house!)

K is for Kool, running through my veins
I got, ice water blood, so I show no shame
Intelligence is next, and that stands for I
Is something you inherit and you cannot buy
N is for night and for armor that shines
Slaying other MCs with vicious style rhymes
And G is for great to describe this man
My name is King Lou, I got a master plan
For the shores of Paris to the streets of Maine
There's a certain reputation I got to maintain
I got to, write the rhymes and say them well
And if I don't do that, I know I've failed
There's a few things I use to get me over
They all fit together like a four-leaf clover
First and most important is originality
You gotta be innovative, versatile as can be
Second on my list, you gotta know how to flake
You got to make the crowd yell, cause a major earthquake
Make 'em stop on the floor and scream for more
From the very first minute that you walk in the door, huh
Movin' right along to the end of the line
You gotta get a fly girl on your devine
Have 'em come to your shows wearin' nice fancy clothes
Looking sharp as a thorn on the stem of the rose
(Born to rock the house!)

Melle Mel is potent, super high-powered
To make other MCs feel devoured
Taught all the MCs, the birds and the bees
But they still can't get your young lady
I'm the legend in leather, the lord of the rhyme
If you can't see that, you must be blind
I always wear black and I always will
'Cause I'm dressing for your funeral, huh
Heads gonna roll and rappers gonna die
And whoever want to battle, I'mma give 'em a try
It ain't no pressure, you know I'm fresher
'Cause I was born to never be lesser
It's more than the record and the show to me
'Cause I came here to set the world free
From around the way, back in the days
We got beat so you can get paid
We made you a job, you two-bit slob
Now you don't have to work, murder, steal or rob
You got a little bit of fame and wealth
Now you think that you did it all by yourself, huh
I am you, but you ain't me
Beause you didn't start rocking 'til '83
Melle Mel is the best that will ever exist
And if I gotta be sucker, suck on this
(Born to rock the house!)
We're born, born, born, born
To rock you, girl
We're born, born, born, born
To rock the world

World War III,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"1984: World War III

Life is a Game of Business
And in the end we fight (swear to god)
The new and old are bought and sold
And everybody thinks theyre right
War is a game of business
A game we shouldnt play (swear to god)
Cause men with guns killed all our sons
They blew us all away
They Called it
World (Paranoia!)
War (its Almost Over)
3 (Cause Nobody Hears what the People Say)
Realistically the Bombs are ready
Technically, Nuclear by name
Capability of total Destruction
Radioactive death and flame
There is talk of a fiery doom
Prophesied since the dawn of time
In a world of bloodshed, mass confusion
Killing, diseases, Pollution and Crime
Man is in Conflict with nature
And that is why theres so much sin
Mother natures delicate balance will fix it so nobody wins
In World (Catastrophic)
War (Reaganomics)
3 (and nobody hears what the people say)
World (its Atomic)
War (catastrophic)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
A thousand miles away from home
A mortally wounded soldier dies
And on the blood stained battlefield
His life flashes before his eyes
Before he dies the man saw Jesus
And Jesus Christ took his hand
And on the soldiers dying breath
The good lord took him to the promised land
Cause theres.. No (people living)
More (People Dying)
Pain (Everybody Disappeared)

Breakdown, Pain
1984, See the world at war
Your darkest fears of reality are knockin down your door
Drones and mutations, Clones and deviations
And theres no one that can escape the nuclear revelation
Because

The silver moon, the midnight stars, jupiter collides with mars
And out of the darkness spirits roar
To cast revenge on the earth once more
The leaders of the world are hypnotized
By wizards, dark and in disguise
Brought to earth by an evil hand
To devour souls in a brand new land
They let the leader think that war brings peace
And out come the one with the mark of the beast
Theres evil behind closed doors
In the year of 1984

Long ago and all too soon
2 different wars fought on the moon
One put (creators?) on it first
Then we blew futher in the universe
Both of these were nuclear wars
Breaking universal laws
Then falling stars and meteorites
Dropped to earth by day and night
Twisters, earthquakes, hurricanes
Volcanos, drops and torrential rain
Then one day, the UFOs
Came to see the whole world explode
We will pay the ultimate price
And a lesson is to be learned
When we play with nuclear fire
Everybodys gonna get burned

Pain! Pain! (so let the music play on)
Between the boundaries of time and space
Was the planet earth and the human race
A world alive and centuries old
With veins of diamonds, silver and gold
Snow capped mountains over looked the land
And the deep blue sea made love with the sand
Full grown strands of evergreen hair
Kissed the sky with a breath of air
Where exotic fish once swam in the sea
And the eagles soared in the sky so free
But the foolish clan that walked the land
Was the creature, that they called man
Theyre cannibalistic, paranoid fools
Tricking each other with games and rules
Training their men to kill and fight
Moving and stearing their mechanized might
Only thought that man had in mind
Was to conquer the world and the rest of mankind
And with the thought that they were right
They gave you permission to take a mans life
The ones you killed fought just as hard
Then you even had the nerve to pray to god
But god dont wanna hear all your mess
When you aint the one that he laid to rest
The devils children with no disgrace
Crushed and killed the human race
While they got rich off the games and war
What in the hell were you fighting for
A silly ass metal, a stupid parade
For all those innocent people you slaid
And after that, you couldnt even get a job
Cause fighting that war made you a slob
A seargeant and major, a corporal, Lieutenant
Titles and positions were all invented
You, and me, and all this mess
Are just a bunch of pieces in a game of chess
Its all the same, a third world war
A blood thirsty massacre just like before
Its genocide, three billion tears
Feeding on a war every twenty years
Then one day we heard the sound
Of the whole damn world tumbling down
Just one big boom, and what do you know
The world is a ghetto, high and low
Crumbling buildings all around
Mans creation burned to the ground
Chaos, panic, fear and pain
Days of radioactive rain
Grotesque figures burned alive
Miraculously seem to survive
Everything of reality is the science fiction on TV
Mutant dog and sabertoothed rats
Eat men with guns and baseball bats
The dead wont die, the (rudie?) wont cry
And everybodys asking the question why
Until swarms of millions walk from the city
And thousands more went underground below
With their head held down in their own pity
Wondering where, they do not know
Cause in this game we had a chance
But we blew it for cheap thrills and romance
Maybe one day well get another play
But until then remember what i say",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-world-war-iii-lyrics
Beat Street,The Sugar Hill Records Story,UnKnown,"Beat Street Breakdown, Raah!
Hip Hop!
Beat Street
The king of the beat
You see him rocking that beat from across the street
And Huh Huh!
Beat Street is a lesson too, because you can't let the Streets beat you!
Well a picture can express a thousand words to describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over, I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colours would swirl and the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand as far as the eyes are able to see, Ha!
I never knew art til I saw your face and there'll never be one to take your place
ÂCause each and every time you touch the spray paint can
Michelangelo's soul controls your hand
Then serenades of blue and red and the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo of colours hang in tune, Man why oh why d'ya have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, where the good die young it's all thy must
ÂCause as life must live, death must die and the tear shall fall from the living eye, Huh!
The teardrops fall for the state of mind of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead, and she still can't get you out of her head, Huh!
More tears fall for all you've done, trying to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed, put a shirt on his back and a roof overhead?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream of the beautiful cities in the islands genes?
When your works of art brought into being all that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the streets, abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are selling their bodies, and everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hanging out tough, rocking late at night, running wild in the town of the neon light
You either play some ball or stand in the hall Huh!
You gotta make something outta nothing at all
I'm sitting in the classroom learning the rules and it says you can't do graffiti in school
They can't be wrong in the hallowed hall, so my notebook turned into a brick wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three, and the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
ÂCause I'm caught in the rat race, looking for my own space
There's gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky, and an eye for an eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweating from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, there's Huh, just us, Ha!
Still life urban masterpiece, your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released, and yet you got killed for nothing at all
So after this there'll be no more hard times, no more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you Hip Hops get on up, and let's take it to the top where we belong
ÂCause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now c'mon, say âHo!' (âHo!'), Say âHo!' (âHo!')
And to let me know I'm rocking the microphone everybody say âRamo!' (âRamo!')
ÂRamo!' (âRamo!')
Raah!
A newspaper burns in the sand, and the headlines say âMan destroys Man!'
Extra! Extra! Read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire, the sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibis
And the foolish attempt to conquer the skies
Lost in space, and what is it worth, huh?
The president just forgot about Earth
Spending multi billions, and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran into zillions
There's gold in the street, and diamonds under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're living like mice
And the houses even make the ghetto look nice, Huh!
The water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
And people shout out in the darkest hour
Of sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims, and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused, Huh!
Minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lice's, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothing is sacred and nothing is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Hitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan
Napoleon, Castro, Mussolini and Begin
Ghengis Khan and the Shah of Iran
Mixed with the blood of the weaker man
The peoples in terror, the leaders made the error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
ÂCause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
To learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
ÂCause the Children of Man inherits the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave âem like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say âOh yeah!' (âOh yeah!')
ÂOh yeah!' (âOh yeah!')

White Lines 89 - Part II (Dont Do It),Piano,UnKnown,"White Lines '89 - Part II (Don't Do It)
Base, blow, base, blow

White Lines 1989, let's try it one more time
While you're standing on the crack line
Using one another
Eyes as wide as a manhole cover
Smoking like a chimney
Puffing like a dragon
Try to hold your breath too long
Now you're gagging
Try to tell yourself that you need a lift
Make a couple of lines and then (sniff!)
Sniff your world away, sniff your girl away
Sniff your life away, sniff your wife away
Sniff your money your gold and your friends
Your credit cards it's not very hard
Once you start it never ends
Blast off hands on the throttle
Basing chasing genies in a bottle
Make a wish but don't say it out loud
All you're gonna gain is pain in another cloud
Anticipation, the thing called crack is going to ruin the nation
Everyone is buying it and then trying it
You made your bed and lie in it
There is no denying it
I'm the drug you should do, but who's fooling who
You tried doing crack but crack is doing you
Base, blow, base, blow

Why did you put your life on the line?
Things were going fine until you played with those white lines
You're in and out of rehab
You put up a front for a month then you relapse
You're back out on the ave you're getting schemed
You need some blow some speed and indeed
You got a nosebleed
You let the blood run on, wipe it away
Then take another one on one, two on two
A hundred on a hundred
Wish it was more but then you already done it all
Even licked the ink off the dollar bill
You had a dollar bill, until you illed and sniffed overkill
It's still yearning, stomach churning, your nose is burning
You're coming down fast start to plummet
Pockets empty as Mother Hubbard's cupboard
Now you're turning to crime
And everything you own is mine all mine, boy
Fun baby... Don't do it! Don't do it!
Base, blow, base, blow

Standing on the corner, like Gotti
Work for Scotty you're a nobody
You met a girl, she's a straight up fiend
Give her a half of crack, she'll lick your nose clean
Slam bam for a quarter graham
Made you feel real, like a big man
Now you're ice cold, flash your bankroll, but
You're the lowest face on the totem pole
Sell to the brother that robbed their mother
That raped the sisters, murdered and killed one another's
Uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces
But for what, a few little pieces of crack?!
A few dollars and a nice set of wheels
Sucker you was born to lose you caught a raw deal
You're a marked man up to no good
Used by the mob to wreck your own neighborhood
And while most Italians get out on bail
You got dark skin, you're gonna rot in jail!
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans or Blacks
You get held back when you sell crack
Base, blow, base, blow

I met a lady, at a party
She had the nerve to say that she want my body
We moved and grooved, she removed, I was smooth
Took her to my room and she sure improved
Two hours later she put on her clothes
Right in my room she start to powder her nose
I told her it was wrong and she made it a joke
She said, ""My name is Pepsi, things go better with Coke""
Base, blow, base, blow

At the front door looking for a white line
And then O.D. off the right rhyme
On the dance floor at the disco
New York, L.A. to San Francisco
The white lines phenomenon goes on and on
Til your money is gone, til the break of dawn
I'm the stuff people love to love
White dove what dreams and nightmares are made of
The ultimate sin for the masses
It could be solid, liquid or gaseous
Powder form crystal whatever
I make you out think yourself, I'm that clever
Make you see things nearer hear clearer
Looking at me is staring down in a mirror and
Seeing the inner demon of your ego
You're a junkie, adios amigo
I left you cold, and your soul's in a black hole
Lo and behold I'm sex drugs and rock and roll
All combined and refined by the devil
To bring all society to my level
Just one more line is worth everything
Your car, your kids even your diamond ring
There's no debating, sniff some of this
You'll belong to satan
Base, blow, base, blow

On your hands and knees, on the floor
Searching, you want and need, got to have some more
You found a rock, tasted bitter
But it wasn't crack it was kitty litter
Executives and athletes
Taste the thrill of victory
The agony of defeat
Colombians will give you a taste
But there's nothing free about freebase
Base, blow, base, blow",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-white-lines-89-part-ii-dont-do-it-lyrics

Hustlers Convention,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"This record is dedicated to Kool Herc
Rrrrhh!

Three-card monte is the name of the game, we play in New York but it was made in Spain. Who said red like the rooster head? You pick the red you get all my bread, black you get no money back. Who see the red like that?
It's the one in the middle
Alright, my friend you got the red so you get all the bread, you see black you get no money back. We gonna try it again my friend 'til it has no end because the red card you win, the black card you lose, it all depends on the card that you choose. Alright, ten to get you twenty, twenty gets you forty, forty gets you eighty, then you can go out and get you a lady
Well I paid forty man I need a pretty lady
Okay it's the red card you win, the black card you lose. You see the hand is quicker than the eye so you must follow my hand my friend and not the card, how much you win?
It's that one right there
Okay, that's black you get no money back, get my money
, no man you cheated me! 
It was a full moon in the middle of June
In the summer of '79
I was young and cool and shot a bad game of pool
And hustled all the chumps I could find
Well now they called me Sport cause I pushed a boss short
And loved all the women to death
I partied hard and packed a mean rod
And could knock you out with a right or a left
I had learned to be cool while playing hooky from school
At the tender age of nine
And by the time I was eleven I could pad-roll seven
And down me a whole quart of wine
I was making it a point to smoke me a joint
At least once during the course of a day
And I was snorting scag while other kids played tag
And my elders went to church to pray
I've pitched pennies and downed bennies
And played the horses at the track
I've won at cards against tremendous odds
And my favorite game was Blackjack
I seldom lost cause my game was so boss
I mean I had my shit down pat
And I was running through freaks eight days a week
Cause that's where my heart was at
Yes I was a down stud's dream, a hustler supreme
There wasn't no game that I couldn't play
And if I caught a dude cheating, I would give him a beating
And I might even blow him away!
Stick-ups, muggers, drugs, in the ghetto
I grew up running wild, i wanted to be public enemy number one!
Little kids used to want to be like me but i always told them:
""Kid, if you live like me, you die like me""
I had so much money i didn't know what to do
I bought up everything and everybody i wanted
And when i got it i just choose to abuse it
 Sometimes wanting is better than having: You want it, you got it!
Yo, yo, who got it good?
Yo, i got it. I got joints, nickels, dimes, half-ounces, ounces, pounds, what you want? cocaine? i got twenty-fives, fifties, grands, eighths, quarters, ounces, kilos, what you want? dust? acid? i got ups, downs,  dope, mescaline, what you want, man, what you want?
Yo, you think i can get a loose joint?
Oh, man...
We took a hundred seventy-two grand
Between me and my man
And we was ready to retire for the rest of the day
But just when we was about to split
Four stick-up kids and Grit
Had plans on takin all our money away
So then I fire five rounds
And two dead bodies hit the ground
And I felt two slugs strike my bulletproof vest
And all that Grit would get
Was a bullet hole on his neck
To match the one i had blasted in his chest
Me and Spoon fled the scene
And they chased us in a limousine
'Til we realized some cats was chasing them and us
And them the flashing lights on top
Told us all that it were the cops
With the intentions of making a bust
I gave Spoon the vest
And fired shots at the rest
On the hopes that Spoon could get free
But the cops shot him in the face
And hit me twice below the waist
And then they started beating the hell out of me
When I came to i was all black and blue
In the hospital ward in jail
I was handcuffed to the bed
With a belly full of lead
And a two hundred thousand dollar bill
When I went to see the judge
The man's eyes didn't budge
He just looked me in my face and said this here
He said: ""Boy, all you gonna be is a menace to society, and that's why we gon' sentence you to the electric chair""
Before i was dead and my eyes popped out my head
I realized what type of petty hustler i had been
Because the real hustlers steal billions
From the unsuspecting millions
That's programmed to think they can win",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-hustlers-convention-lyrics

It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head

It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow

Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A zircon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watching all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so, so saditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

My brother's doing bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standing on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under

My son said, ""Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cause it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say, 'You want some more?' Livin' on a see-saw""

Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head (Say what?)
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto living second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool""
But then you wind up droppin' out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null and void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Being used and abused to serve like hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young, so

Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from going under
Huh, ah-huh-huh-huh-huh

Superappin,The Enjoy! Story,1979,"It was a party night, everybody was breaking
The highs were screaming and the bass was shaking
And it won't be long till everybody knowin' that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going that
Flash was on the beat box going
And, and, and, and
Sha-na-na
Italian, Caucasian, Japanese
Spanish, Indian, Negro, Vi-et-namese
M.C's, disc jockeys
To all the fly kids and the young ladies
Introducing the crew ya got to see to believe
We're one, two, three, four, five M.C's
I'm Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And I'm Mr. Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem in all the ladies' dreams
And I'm Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
I'm Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole playing the role
Dig this, we're the Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Giving you a blast and Sho'nuff class
So to prove to ya all, we're second to none
We're gonna make five M.C's sound like one
Ya gotta dip dip dive, so so socialize
Clean out your ears and then open your eyes
And then pay at the door as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
He's a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame
But he'll shock and amaze and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
And from a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure is 3 times 2 is 6
You'll say Flash is the king of the quick mix
We're five M.C's and we're on our own
And we're the most well known, on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and that's a fact
And the satisfaction guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an e-m-c-e-e
Is not a threat to society
Say step by step
Stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my Mercedes, 'young ladies'
In my Mercedes, 'young ladies'
If my Mercedes breakdown and dog my grill
I will ahh, drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I take it on back
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Cadillac
My Cadillac break down, i'm just too much
I will ahh, shock your mind in a new Star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I make another choice
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if a Royce break down, I'll be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Can't, won't, don't stop, rockin' to the rhythm
Cause I, I get down, cause I, I get down, cause I, I get down

Ladies who don't know my name
And you fellas who don't know my game
Yes I'm called the prince of soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The M.C delight, young ladies bite
When I'm on the mike, I rock the house right
I'm the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin to the rhythm while I'm playing the role
A cool calm customer, the master plan
It takes a sucker's man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do and what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say 'all right'
Creole to the broad daylight
Mr. Ness, my mellow, what he look like
With ya on the mike

Let's a rock y'all, a let's a rock the house
Because the Furious Five are gonna turn it out
So young ladies, if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Yes, it's true that we got the fuss
Because it can't be the best unless it came from us
There's five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming through rough
We number one ain't nothin' you can do
And if you wanna get down we'll rock you too
So free-formin y'all, you don't stop
Come on, come on and let me see 'a rock rock
Cowboy, they say you're from the bronx
So why don't you rock the beat and add a little spunk

Yes yes, y'all, ya don't stop
Come on fly girls, I wanna hit the top
I am the c-o-w-b-o-y
Why the man so bad that ya can't deny
You better watch your woman cause I'll tell you why
Cause I'm Cowboy, I might give her a try
They call me Keith Keith
The young ladies' relief
Know as the man of romance and make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance?
I'm Cowboy and I'm shockin the house
Ya say, ya say 1, 2, 1 more is 3
Ah, Melle Mel come on, whatcha got for me?

To the hip hop, a hip hop, a don't stop, don't stop that body rock
Ah, Just get up out your seat and get ready to clap
Because ah, Melle Mel is starting to rap
And ever since I talked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rapping on the mic, making cold cold cash
With a jockey spinnin for me called DJ Flash
Signing autographs for the the young and old
Wearing big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It's ain't like that yet, but -huh- you'll see
I got potential and you will agree
I'm coming up and I got a step above the rest
Cause I'm using that ladder they call success
You say 1-2-3-4-5-6-7
Rap like hell and make it sound like heaven
A 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 come on Rahiem come and get some

Yes yes y'all, ya don't stop, come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top
I'm a one of a kind, the man supreme
I know I'm in all, all the ladies' dreams
I'm the r-a-h and the i-e-m
I put a wiggle in your butt if a tell me when
I'm the son of a gun with the hell of a fire
Now gather, mess around i'll take ya all higher
My clientele climb the great big boost/boots
I'm the give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that don't know my game
Come up and talk to me and we'll tell you all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies' dreams

And makin' more currency than any M.C
And if the dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel'll be makin' money
Mr. Ness, make makin' money
Rahiem, makin' money
Cowboy , make makin' money
Creole, makin' money
DJ Flash, make makin' money
Hit it


Take your time and you will agree
That Black Door got good security
So when you walk through the door, just do me a favor
Be sure to be on your best behavior
Young man, what do you wanna do
When the party is through
And a young lady wanna go home with you
You search your pocket, ya soon aware
That you don't have enough for cab fare
Then you say to yourself what a mistake ya' made
Your heart start pumpin' that ol' Kool-Aid
When she walks to you and she starts to say
'Call one-double-o' it's down with O.J
And you pave the way....

Young ladies a like, young ladies galore, young ladies
We do adore
From the way they move and the way they smile
It make's me admire their grace and style
There is not room for disbelief
That's the only way that The Kid Creole can relieve
Or rock the house

I'm the Scorpio and I will not flow
I need 10 fly girls before I go
Now when the night is done
You come and get some
(Then you meet Mr. Ness
And you have some fun)
Till you walk up real soon
And you head for my place
And when you get in my room
You touch my face and then you start to chase
And then you grab em' by the waist
(And then I lay you right back I'm on a steady pace)

I'm the only go of the rodeo
Ya' say I ride in the rain till it's time to go
I'm the buckaroo of the boogaloo
(All the young ladies roll when he pass through)
I got 2 jazzy ladies in deep deep check
(Both ladies in the discotheque)
I got 1 in the front and 1 behind
I'm in the middle cause they're both mine

Yes yes y'all, you don't stop
Ah that body rock
From the shores of California to the streets of New York
Ain't nothing sweeter than ya walk
Cause thats the way you front
You got hair everywhere, skin so fair
A dynamic personality, (a lot of flair)
With your flashy clothes and your photogenic pose
You're as sharp as a thorn on the stem of a rose
So petite and elite you're huh, too sweet
So great I'm amazed that you can't be beat
The way you swerve your curves
It really wrecks my nerves
You're everything that a man deserves
So women of the world amen to thee
(Because women like you make men like me)

Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
Come on, come on, huh
I wanna hit the top
Young ladies out there I won't be surprised
If I catch you watchin' or starin' in my eyes
Come a little closer and you're sure to find that
I'm a helluva fella and I'm one of a kind
If you happen to stare for just about a hour
You sweet young thing you'll be in my power
Don't fight the feelin', it's nothin' you could do
Except watch your back (HUH) 'cause I'm gonna pursue
If you think that you can't contain yourself
Well put all the silly games right up on the shelf
Come here ya sexy figure, tell ya what I'm gonna do
(I got a hell of a proposition just for you)
Gonna stick the lovin' to ya, baby, later for a kiss
If you pass the chance up, you know you just missed
Beyond the shadow of a doubt, or anything you can believe
If you so deep in the forest that you can't see the trees
Creole, my mellow
It's on you so what you gonna do?

You say I rock the house because the MC's run
Place a bet with this devil, cheated for a hun'
Call any calm man, with bat or bowl
I go by the name of the Kid Creole
I'm the king of finesse, I'm here to rock the rest
All the young ladies I wanna impress
When I rap on the mic, I guarantee
A certain amount of consistency
Like Flash we'll cut the record to the bone
Creole will rock on the microphone
Mr. Ness, my mellow
Come and get some 'cause we're number one

Don't stop y'all, let me see ya rock
We gonna rock to the sounds around the clock
We gonna move to the beat but don't you dare stop
Come on everybody, stop playin' around
Because you got to get up so we can get down
Unless you too hot to trot and not ready to rock
Come on and dance give me what you got
'Cause you know by now you got to give me something
'Cause after all you sweeter than honey
Get down on your behalf
Because you gotta do it do for your calfs, Cowboy
They say you from the Bronx
So won'tchu rock and add a little spunk

Yes, yes y'all
You don't stop
A come on girl, let's hit the top
Like a .357 pointed towards your head
Cowboy just about ready for the bed
So pull back the covers and take down your pants
'Cause Cowboy will make you Patty Duke dance
A side to side and you pat ya foot
Get up out ya seat then you shake your butt
You say 1, 2, one more is 3
Melle Mel come on, whatchu got for me

You don't stop
That body rock
They say a child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
Your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps, and pushers, they're the big money makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them
Huh, smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket, peddlers, even panhandlers
You say, ""I'm cool,"" huh, ""I'm no fool""
But you'll wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non void
Walkin' around like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, and look what you done did
Got sent up for an eight year bid
Now your manhood is took, you're a maytag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Bein' used and abused, served like Hell
'Til one day you was found hung dead in a cell

You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad, song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
Say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Rap like Hell and make it sound like Heaven
7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Now come on Raheem
A come and get some

Yes, yes, y'all
You don't stop
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
And let me see you rock
I'm only five-foot nine, you think I care?
I can pull a girl from anywhere
'Cause I'm bubblin' 'round, just the talk of the town
When they talk about me, they don't dare frown
I'm too hot to trot, to cold to walk, huh
To all the fly girls, I'm aimin' to talk
To all the fly girls, you got to beware
'Cause Raheim, huh, will be in yo hair
Just come over to the roast, listen to me
Because everybody knows Raheem is what it be
Melle Mel (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out
Mr. Ness (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out
Raheem, (Bang), rock the house (House)
Come on, help me turn it out

New York New York,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1980,"Ah New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around, too much
Ah too many people, too much -- a ha hah
Too much, too many people, too much, rrrrrrrah!

A castle in the sky, one mile high
Built to shelter the rich and greedy
Rows of eyes, disguised as windows
Lookin down on the poor and the needy
Miles of people, marchin up the avenue
Doin what they gotta do, just to get by
I'm livin in the land of plenty and many
But I'm damn sure poor and I don't know why

Too much, ah too many people, too much
Too much, too many people, too much!

A man's on a ledge, says he's gonna jump
People gather round, said, ""He won't he's just a chump""
Cause he lost his job, then he got robbed
His mortgage is due and his marriage is through
He says he ain't gonna pay no child support
Because the bitch left him without a second thought
He got nothin to eat, no shoes on his feet
She even left his clothes, out in the street
He keeps hearin noises when he's at home
He always hears voices when he's all alone
His wife took the kids, the car and the crib
In this man's world, so much for women's lib

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law, and I know my way around

Down in the Village, you might think I'm silly
But you can't tell the women from the men sometimes
They're sugar and spice and everything nice
But when you get em home ain't no tellin what you find
Right next door is a little old man
I seen him eatin dog food out of a can
He says, ""I got to eat, when I can't afford meat
I barely can stand, on my own two feet""
I got a bad habit and I just can't break it
Somethin's on my mind and I just can't shake it
I need some time, and I want some space
I gotta get away from the human race

Too much, ah too many people, too much... a-ha hah
Too much, ah too many people, too much! Rrrrrrrah!

Stand at a skyscraper reachin into heaven
When over in the ghetto I'm livin in hell
Just play ball or be an entertainer
Cause niggas like me can't read too well
Nobody loves me, nobody cares
I dreamed about a life but I'm livin in a nightmare
Paranoid schitzo, set back, snowbound
Bad news psycho, heart attack, breakdown!
Hee, huh (16X) HUH!

If only I could sleep just ten more minutes
I might find the strength to make another day
If I didn't have to get up, and do my thing
I would probably sleep my whole life away
I messed up a nice dream, somethin bout ice cream
Whipped cream fruits and a cherry on top
Now I gotta get up and face the world, huh
The pressure is on it ain't never gonna stop
I sho' gotta learn to use my mind
I don't wanna be kissin nobody's behind
Just standin on line lookin like a jerk
Gotta get off my butt and do a full day's work
I ran into a pothole, got into a car crash
Shoulda been thinkin and tried to fake whiplash
A crowd gathered round, they're callin me fat
Who you lookin at wit a face like that?

New York New York big city of dreams
Everything in New York ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

On 42nd Street, lookin for some action
Women standin on the corner sellin satisfaction
One young punk just leanin on the fence
Tryin to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
Really is a prankster, tried to be a gangster
Real big wheel when a gun is in his hands
Just did a stick-up, just got picked up
One dead punk, killed by the man

New York New York big city of dreams
And everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around
Too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much! HUAHH!

A baby cries and a mother dies
And the tears fall from the doctor's eyes because
In this room, on this day
The Good Lord has giveth, and taketh away, huh
The gift of life really means a lot
And in the ghetto your life is all you got
So you take to the streets, tryin to exist
In the trash and slime of a world like this
What you watch, on TV
A tells you what life is supposed to be
But when you look outside the only thing you see
Is the poverty stricken, reality, heh
Abandoned places, angry faces
Much hate and hunger throughout the races
You say, ""I'm grown and I'm on my own
So why don't everybody just leave me alone!""
Now you stay at home, talkin on the phone
Doin ninety miles an hour in the fifty mile zone
They never took the time to tell you bout sex
So you had to learn about it in the discotheques
Nine months later, the baby is there
And the nigga that did it said, ""I don't care!""
You don't have enough money to help feed two
So you have to choose between the baby and you
The sky was cryin, rain and hail
When you put yo' baby in the garbage pail
Then you kissed the kid and put down the lid
And you tried to forget what you just did, huh
The muffled screams of a dyin baby
Was enough to drive the young mother crazy
So she ran in the rain tryin to ease the pain
Huh huh, and she drove herself insane

New York New York big city of dreams
But everything in New York ain't always what it seem
You might get fooled if you come from out of town
But I'm down by law and I know my way around

Ah too much, too many people, too much... ah ha hah hah
Too much, too many people, too much! HUHHH!

Aay, ""Party""
(Party!)
A-C'mon
Heh heh, heh whoo!
Ah yeah
If you wanna party and that's a fact somebody say. ""And you know that""
(And you know that!)

We don't care if you're 8 to 10
Or if you're a senior citizen
Because we got a beat that just won't end
So you better get ready to rock my friend!
You see, we got some news
That you can use
An offer that you can't refuse
We're givin' up honey, and you got to come
Because you're the one!
Red, yellow, black, white, or brown
In our own way we can all get down
So just take your time and enjoy yourself
And you'll rock as good as anyone else
A-come on go to it, put your body into it
If the feelin' is good then you might as well do it
See it makes no sense a-just standin' around
Just boogie to the beat of the funky sound
You don't rock with us, you won't have a ball
And we might as well didn't rock at all
You see we can't rock if you don't have fun
Because you're the one that's number one
Now raise your hand up above your head
If you agree what I said
Then writhe your hands all in the air
Somebody say, ""Oh yeah""
(Oh yeah!)
Ha ha ha ha!
Flash! One time!

Melle Mel with the clientele
I'm gonna rock your chime and ring your bell
See I'm so bad and I'm so light
To write a rhyme on a dime to make the world turn twice

And I'm Mr. Ness, that rock the best
And I'm ready to rock at your request
Go on, go on with your bad self
Raheim is gonna do the rest

So my name is Raheim
I'm a son of a queen
I'm the king of my castle
Don't give me no hassle
Young ladies in the place, put me on
When I'm a part of your life, you can never go wrong

You say at first my name was Denny Den
The secret weapon, the master plan
I'm slick, I'm cool, I'm solid gold
They call me the Kid Creole

I'm the C.O.W.B.O.Y. (why)
The man's so bad that you can't deny
And when you ask the cowboy to play
I'm Cowboy, I never ran away

Grandmaster, cut faster
Than any known, stone to the bone
Full-grown he's a one of a kind
And Flash is gonna rock your mind, huh
Flash, two times
Beep beep, you in the crew, hold it
Why don't you find somebody and...party!
I like this part
Get down
Whoo! Yeah, alright, alright
Quickly now, quickly now
The bass was in your face
The highs that make your nature rise
Young ladies in the place
Feel the highs, feel the bass
If you wanna rock till the break of dawn somebody say, ""Come on""
(Come on!)

Melle Mel, right on time
Taurus the bull is my Zodiac sign
And I'm Mr Ness and I'm ready to go
And I go by the sign of Scorpio
My name is Raheim, I don't like to fuss
My Zodiac sign is Aquarius
The Kid Creole is the name of mine
And Pisces is my Zodiac sign
And I'm Cowboy and I'm runnin' this show
My Zodiac show is uh, Virgo
And Grandmaster Flash cuts so on
His Zodiac sign is Capricorn
We gon' try somethin new
(Whatchu gon' do!?)
We gon' try somethin new
(Whatchu gon' do!?)
Now that you heard our names and signs
Put your name into this rhyme
What's your name?
(All yell names)
I say what's your name?
(All yell names)
And gon' try somethin' else
Go for yourself
And gon' try somethin' else
Go for yourself
Gon' try this game, one more time
Now this time use your Zodiac sign
What's your sign!?
(All yell signs)
I say what's your sign!?
(All yell signs)
Ha ha ha ha!
Flash! Two times!
Beep beep, you in the crew, hold it
Hey, why don't you find somebody and...party!
Oohwee oohwee
Here come the kazoos, alright!
No doubt, get down, whoo! Heh
Young ladies in the place
Bass in your face
Ha ha ha ha, ugh

The ladies' action, the coming attraction
The man with the positive reaction
The man with the style on top of the pile
Melle Mel gonna rock a long, long while
I want a Rolls Royce, I got a golden voice
Gonna rock in the mic if you give me the choice
And I rock to the beat and I got it like that
And you couldn't beat that with a baseball bat

I could play a dumb game and I won't feel ashamed
Because I got more smarts than any slick git
I'm not the butcher, the baker, or the candlestick maker
But I'm Mr. Ness the woman's taker
When I talk to some girls, the girls think I'm dumb
But that's O.k. because they all get some
I'mma tell it like this, you will never discover
That Ness is, is a lover

I'm the force that keeps you on when you tend to stray
I'm the jester of the joust so heed what I say
This advice I give to you is for you to keep
All I want you to do is just sow what I reap
I'm 100% on all the time
I'm like Earl the Pearl when I'm saying a rhyme
I could get taped on like a magical wand
I make all the ladies' dreams and my word is bond

We're sick, we're bad and powerful
We fill you with five hours full
Of the music that's proclaimed the best
In town to the funky sound
Now clap your hands, do the freak dance
Become a victim of circumstance
'Cause everybody rocks with Flash and the Five
Get down RRAH!

The butter, the bread
The bread to the butter
C'mon everybody let's rock one and another
Hey ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Nobody rocks the mic like the five of us

You say the bread to the butter and the butter to the bread
Don't be misled by what I say
You say dust to dust and ashes to ashes
'Cause no man cuts are faster than Flash's
You're the one

You don't stop and everybody hiphop
You don't stop and then find your 
Just clap your hands and get on the go
Then you rock to the beat in stereo
And if you wanna help us get on the go
Scream it out and say, ""Ho""
(Ho!)
""Ho""
(Ho!)
You don't stop
And if you wanna rock into the broad daylight
Somebody say, ""What it look like""
(What it look like!)
""What it look like""
(What it look like!)
You don't stop
I'm gonna talk about the man that's the real McCoy
No other cool brother than Keith Cowboy
I wear a eight and a half, a 29 waist
A medium shirt take a look at my face
You check out my hair and then you look in my eyes
'Cause all I'm here to do girl is make you hypnotized
Till you hip hop the shoobop doobop take a look on your arm
And check your clock
Let's do it, let's do it
You know you got to do, do it
To the beat, y'all
You don't, you better not
Don't stop that body rock

Contained by wild beasts
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies' thighs
Cause all the fly guys'
Natures to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
And the heir of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine

Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy
And keep on shaking that thing
And I want you
Swingin it swingin it swingin

Don't you worry bout a thing, Rahiem'll do you right
I'm a man that's fresh huh, a woman's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get
In the history books or the picture show
It's the golden voice on your radio
I'm the rapper never printed, voice is solid gold
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole
And I'm the, the Romeo of the nasty show
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go
Freaking in the den just to make you move
Cause I'm Cowboy, and I got the groove
As DJ Flash cuts so mean
That he wanna know your favorite jean
Is it Jordache? (NO!) Gloria Vanderbilt? (NO!)
Maybe it's Sassoon? (NO!) How about Sergio? (I DON'T CARE!)
Could it be Calvin Klein? (NO!) Then what is it?
Back to the bridge y'all

And helping us turn it out
Is everybody sayin play? (PLAY!)
Say play! (PLAY!) Well OK!
Alright, woo!

Got waterbed seats in my limousine
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean
I tour around the world to make the people dance
And here's a little message for the ladies in France
Je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Donne moi la petit mademoiselle
Donne moi cinq, donne moi six
Donne moi huit, neuf, dix
I'm seeing this girl that I just adore
I'm seeing this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Rahiem in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Rahiem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my sleeve
Only one fine lady, that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game
Well I'mma Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest
Grandmaster Flash is willing and able
He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's and 33's
Rocks boys, men, women, and young ladies
He can slice so precise it's almost fun
And he makes better love than a mint makes money

Super Rappin No.2,The Enjoy! Story,1979,"Sha-na-na
Introducin the crew ya' got to see to believe
Were one, two, three, four, five MCs
Im Melle Mel and I rock it so well
And Im Mr.Ness because I rocks the best
I'm Rahiem hah, in all the ladies dreams
And Im Cowboy to make ya jump for joy
Im Creole, solid gold
The Kid Creole, playin the role
Dig this
Were The Furious Five plus Grandmaster Flash
Givin you a blast and show nuff class
So to prove to ya all, were second to none
Were gonna make five MCs sound like one
Ya gotta dip with the dive
Get so socialize
Clean out your ears
And open your eyes
And then you pay at the door, as a donation
To hear the best sounds in creation
Hes a disco dream of a mean machine
And when it comes to size, ya see what we mean
Ya see his name is not found in the hall of fame
But hell shock and amaze and make ya feel shame
He takes a lime from a lemon
From a lemon to a lime
He cuts the beat in half the time
And as sure as 3 times 2 is 6
Youll say flash is the king of the quick mix
Were five MCs and were on our own
And were the most well known on the microphone
And we throw down hard and we aim to please
With finesse to impress all the young ladies
We got rhymes galore and thats a fact
And the satisfactions guaranteed to cause a heart attack
We are the best as you can see
So eliminate the possibility
That to be an E-M-C-E-E
Is not a threat to society
I say step by step
Stride by stride
I know the fly young lady would like to ride
In my Mercedes, young lady
In my Mercedes, young lady
If my Mercedes break down and dog my grill
I will ahh, drive up in a new Seville
If my Seville break down, I take it on back
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Cadillac
My Cadillac break down, i'm just too much
I will ahh, shock your mind in a new star Stutz
And if a Stutz break down, I make another choice
I will ahh, dog my grill in a new Rolls Royce
And if a Royce break down, Ill be out in the rain
And then forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it, forget it
Huh, take the train
Take the train, take the train
Cant, wont, dont stop rockin to the rhythm
Cause I get down, cause I get down, cause I get down
Young ladies who dont know my name
And you fellas who dont know my game, huh
Yes Im called the Prince of Soul
But others call me the Kid Creole
The MC delight, young ladies bite
When Im on the mic I rock the house right
Im the dedicated prince, heart of solid gold
Rockin to the rhythm while Im playin the roll
A cool calm custom of the master plan
It takes a suckers man to try to jump my hand
And the things I do, what I say
Affect a lot of people in the strangest way
Makes them clap their hands and say ""all right""
It's Creole to the broad daylight
Mister Ness, my mellow
Come and get some, cause were number 1
So go on, go on with your bad self
And let Flash just do the rest
Furious Five is gonna turn it out
So young ladies if you think ya heard
You heard the best rap, you heard the best word
Well yes its true that we gotta fuss
Because it cant be the best unless it came from us
Theres five of us and we take no stuff
We coming through the city, we coming too rough
We number one aint nothin you can do
And if you wanna get down well rock you too
So get down, get down, get down, get down
Come on Cowboy get down
Yes yes, yall, ya dont stop
Cmon fly girls, I wanna' hit the top
Cause Im the C-O-W-B-O-Y
Why the man so bad that ya cant deny
You better watch your woman cause Ill tell you why
Cause Im Cowboy, I might give her a try
They call me Keith Keith
The young ladies relief
Know as the man of romance to make you dance
Can any of you ladies stand a chance
Im cowboy and Im shockin the house, ya see
Ya' say 1, 2, 1 more is 3
And Melle Mel rock the mic so viciously
Ah, to the, hip hop, the hip hop, and dont stop
Dont stop that body rock
Just get up out your seat, and get ready to clap
Because Melle Mel just about ready to rap
And ever since I talked at my very first party
I felt I could make myself somebody
It was something in my heart from the very start
I could see myself at the top of the chart
Rappin on the mic, makin cold cold cash
With a jock spinnin for me called D.J. Flash
Signin autographs for the the young and old
Wearin big time silver and solid gold
My name on the radio and in the magazine
My picture on the TV screen
It aint like that yet, but huh youll see
I got potential and you will agree
Im comin up and I got a step above the rest
Cause Im using that ladder they call success
You say  1-23-45-67
Rap it like hell and make it sound like heaven
7-65-43-21 cmon Rahiem come and get some
I said my name is Rahiem
Im the son of a queen
Im the king of my castle, dont gimme no hassle
Im a one of a kind, the man supreme
I know Im in all of the ladies dreams
Im the R-A-H and the I-E-M
I put a wiggle in your butt if ya tell me when
Im the son of a gun with the hell of a fire
Now gather mess around i'll take ya all higher
My clientele climb the great big boost
Im the give it up and turn it loose, huh
All you fly girls that dont know my game
Come up and talk to me and well tell ya all the same
When ya wake up in the night in a hell of a dream
You know ya been possessed by the voice of Rahiem
In all the ladies dreams
And makin more currency than any MC
This dream will turn to reality
And Melle Mel, bang, rock the house, pow
Cmon, help me turn it out
Mr. Ness, bang, rock the house, pow

The Message (Re-Recorded),UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
'Cause the man with the tow-truck repossessed my car
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Standing on the front stoop, hangin out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
A crazy lady, livin in a bag
Eating out of garbage piles, used to be a fag-hag
Said, she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
Was circon princess, seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got Social Security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Ha-ha-ha-ha
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My brothers doin' bad, stole my mothers TV
Says, she watches to much, is just not healthy
""All my children"" in the daytime, ""Dallas"" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon king kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A midrange migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
My son said, ""daddy, I don't wanna go to school
Cause the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
I dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'Cause it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed the arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park, 'cause it's crazy after the dark
Keep my hand on the gun, 'cause they got me on the run
I feel like an outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say you want some more, livin on a seesaw
Don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
A child is born, with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you, but he's frowning too
Because only God knows what you go through
You grow in the ghetto, living second rate
And your eyes will sing a song of deep hate
The place that you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alley way
You'll admire all the number book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money makers
Driving big cars, spending twenties and tens
And you wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpockets, peddlers and even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, I'm no fool
But then you wind up dropping out of high school
Now you're unemployed, all null 'n void
Walking 'round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stickup kid, look what you done did
Got send up for a eight year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a may tag
Spend the next two years as an undercover fag
Being used and abused and served like hell
Till one day you was found hung dead in a cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young
So, don't push me, 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Huh-huh-huh-huh-huh-huh

Contained by wild beasts
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies thighs
Cause all the fly guys
Nature's to rise right before their eyes
We're the earl of the world
And the air of flair
The duke of dare
The mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine
(Chorus)
Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy, and keep on shakin that thing
And I want you - swingin it swingin it swingin

Got waterbed sets in my limousine
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean
I tour around the world, to make the people dance
And here's a little message for the ladies in France
Huh huh, je m'appelle, Melle Mel
Ah donnez-moi la magique , mademoiselle
Donnez-moi cinq, donnez-moi six
Donnez moi huit, neuf, dix
I'm seein this girl that I just adore
I'm seein this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game
Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock

He's the king of the cuts on two turntables
He's the GRAND, GRAND, the master man
He's so nice with his hands he don't need no band
Rocks 45's, and 33's
Rocks boys men women and young ladies

And he makes better love than a mick makes money

You Are,The Message,1982,"You have been so good to me
And you're very very wonderful
Lovely and beautiful to me
To me
The start of life is what I'm after
What does it take to capture
All the things
'Cause you're very very wonderful, yes you are
Lovely and beautiful to me, to me yeah
Yes, you're very very wonderful, yes you are lord
Lovely and beautiful to me, to me

You know, a lot of people don't realize it, but
Our lord, Jesus Christ, is the father
And everyone might not do the right thing in the father's eyes
But our father's very forgiving, and he loves everyone
And in this crazy mixed-up world of ours
Where things never seem to go right
As times goes on, we will have to surpass and overcome all these things
Which are negative and unjust
And I know that we will, and so does the father
God bless you all
Lovely and beautiful, to me
Yes, you're very very wonderful
Love, to me
Love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya, love ya
'Cause, very wonderful
Lovely and beautiful

U Know What Time It Is,Ba-Dop-Boom-Bang,UnKnown,"Just get off the wall, let's have a ball
The 70's are gone, it's the 80's y'all
Grab a fly girl by the hand and ask her to dance
C'mon fellas don't be shy, just take a chance
You'll never know it might lead to romance
Cause the beat is cold stompin', it'll put you in a trance
You're so hypnotized that you stop and stare
I'm steppin out of this cuase I'm not with that there!
Get on the dancefloor c'mon take a stand
All the girlies in the place wanna dance with you my man
Get on the floor and work it out if you can
Here's my ulterior motive, I mean my game plan
It doesn't hurt to flirt, just go ahead and chase the skirt
You can't help it, it's your line of work
To get women on the floor
It's you they adore, you might as well
Chorus:
You know what time it is
Hang on party people cause here we go
We're gonna cold take the party to another plateau
But in order for us to achieve a new height
We wanna hear flash cut the beat up, ain't that right
While flash is choppin the mix like an ax on wood
You gotta dance cuase the beat is finger lickin good
Throw your hands above your head and reach for a cloud
And if there's anything you want to say, say it loud
I know the bass is pumpin' so hard the lights are dim
And y'all are lettin me know we're cold blowin the rim
That's right , you're being served, served with a smile
And homeboy you don't like it, we can step in the aisle
Just show no shame, you know it's only right
And if there's anything you want to get off, get it off tonight
Chorus
A simple puch of the fade, a little flex of the wrist
Flash whoopin the mix while I'm kickin the gift
Yo like a double edge razor, the boy is nice
When he cuts, give him room, or you might get sliced
He's too cold to hold, to hot to be stopped
This jam that we got is good to the last drop
Weather you like it or not, we rock
Yo since the day we emerged, have you heard
That it was all about a party and yo' this is word
This party's rated ns for no suckers allowed
That's the scoop, hear me troop
So don't you come here actin' wild
But as you know there's always one in the crowd
You wanna party, then act like you know, can you dig it
And if you came to get ill, forget it, I ain't with it

We're Grandmaster Flash!
We're giving you a blast of class! Huh!
And if you wanna know why we're on top of the pile
Cuz we got style!
(Verse 1)
Yves Saint Laurent, Pierre Cardin
The ?, the ?, and the ?
Styles not Gucci or Louis Vuitton
Imported straight from the Bronx and my name's LaVon
Creole with a few words I'd like to voice
And I ? particular choice
Got style and finesse and I'm sure you'll agree
Nobody ever never ever rhymes quite like me

(Verse 2)
Well my name is Broadway and games I don't play
For me the mystical, the magical but you're okay
The young man supreme I got savoir faire
And you can come into my world if you dare
Raheim the lady dream is my claim to fame
Strictly emphasizing I posses true game
Got style all around me like drapes on a wall
Responding to my slightest whim when I'm takin' a call
(Hook)

(Hook)
(Verse 3)
He's Larry-Love and if you have any doubt
Come try your luck and he'll take you right out
He's making the moves others never thought of
Grindin' up the floors in all the nightclubs
That want the Grandmaster Flash that everybody knows
He leaves a trail of destruction wherever he goes
Gotta style like a young jock's never seen
Don't deny you're full of envy, boy your face is turning green!

Picture us stackin' down, shit we came too far
We done paid our dues, still in the game
Why these niggas actin' like they can't feel the pain
My thoughts is deep, Suburban slang up with heat
Talk is cheap, just show me money, them big faces
Been down since RUN-DMC with big laces
Tapes, diamond nigga we bout to hit that
Hit it at the club all y'all hoes gon' bizack
Big exec checks, bitch nothin' less
And I pull on the strip with Jets, Harley nigga


I'm a street nigga, load up my heat with hollow tips
Acknowledge this, go against the grain and feel stiff rain
We big stings, stackin' our safes to capacity
Force tragedies, a thug mentality
Test my heart pumps blood
We can throw slugs or shoot the fifth, call me
I'm all for it, I don't care bounce ya fair or where ya from
We can act dumb and leave niggas backs numb
I wanna eat on some legal and shit
But I was born on some evil shit
Ridin' ways, my childhood is far from forgotten days
See moms locked away, that's why I hate cops today
So I cop the yay, lock the block, pumpin' trays
If I reach and shoot, believe that niggas lay
But I went through my trigger phase
Now I want a bigger case
Fuck dippin' jakes now we sittin' great


Yo, it's a shame how these bitches wanna know if I'm holdin' a knot
Haters on the block, gassin' us from holdin' a Glock
And I'm looney too, Big K big way
My mental states I been through breakdown airway
Bottles or rat, nigga straight sleep with the fishes
My team is vicious, holla at the baddest bitches
Know what I got, hit the crib hot cold to rock
Steamin' off the top then my soldiers box
Flip the score, plot ways to hustle on tours
See these hit the pipe, fuck up they jaw
I'm livin' ya rap, hot weight I'm triplin' that
Pack 22s, come on y'all I'm fuckin' with macks
Laid back, spazz like I did five flat

Contained by wild beasts
The finesse of the West, the masterpiece of the East
Hah, the boss of course
As the lord of our fort
The ones with the platinum vocal chords
We're the science of desire
With a magical mic
The monarch of the dark in the night alright
We advertise
And specialize
In the exercise and we'll energize
The young ladies thighs
Cause all the fly guys
Nature's to rise right before their eyes
We're the Earl of the world
And the Air of flair
The Duke of dare, the Mayor of debonaire
Got fine, drink wine
Can dance and dine
Got a first class female oh so fine
(Chorus)
Hey baby, whatever you doin right girl
I just want you to always be easy, and keep on shakin that thing

Watch your girl and watch your wife
I got the kiss of death, to touch your life

I like fly girls that don't say no
Hey girl, grab my hand, hold on tight
Don't you worry bout a thing Raheem'll do you right
I'm a mint that's fresh huh, a woman's pet
There ain't a thing in the world that I can't get
In the history books or the picture show
It's the golden voice on your radio
I'm the rapper never printed voice is solid gold
I'm playin the role, they call me Kid Creole
And I'm the, the Romeo, of the nasty show
All the ladies in the place, to my house we go
Freakin in the den just to make you move
Cause I'm Cowboy, and I got the groove
As DJ Flash, cuts so mean
That he wanna know your favorite jean
Is it Jordache? (NO!) Gloria Vanderbilt? (NO!)
Maybe it's Sassoon? (NO!) How about Sergio? (I DON'T CARE!)
Could it be Calvin Klein? (NO!) Then what is it? (?????)

Just let us rock, you!
Got waterbed sets in my limousine
And everytime I'm seen I got to be clean

And here's a little message for the ladies in France
?Huh huh, zmapel, Melle Mel? (I have no idea what Melle Mel says)
?Ah dome mal lamate mademoiselle?
?Done wa sing, done marseis?
?Done wa rik no dees!?
I'm seein this girl that I just adore
I'm seein this girl that what I never saw before
The way she was swaying and doing the swing
I had to let her know just about my thing
I'm the M, R, N E-Double S
Come on, ah fly girl, and put me to a test
And I'll rock you, until you give me the rest
I keep on it, until you start to fess
Raheem, in your life, what more can you ask
I bet you can't think of a greater task
I make my light shine on your cloudy days
You can surf if you want to, on my waves
I caress your soft body on those mellow nights
A continuous thing, to the morning light
It's reality, it's not a dream
It's nothing less than the best when it's from Raheem
Now it's my turn so understand
That I'm the Kid Creole, and I'm a ladies man
I don't, have a lot of women hangin on my steez
Only one fine lady that you better believe
I say Annette's her name, and that's the truth
I give a lot of things up, before I turn her loose
It's just her, and that's simple and plain
And that's the only way I run my game
Well I'ma, Cowboy and I'm the real McCoy
I'm chocolate all over like an Almond Joy
Bowlegged cool brother and you will agree
On top of the world for the ladies to see
Gonna hip gonna hop gonna rock the spot
Gonna make everybody wanna rock rock rock
Gonna do it to the East, wanna do it to the West
Gonna make you relax right upon your chest
Grandmaster Flash, is willing and able

The Message- Kroesche,UnKnown,1982,"It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'Cause a man with a tow truck repossessed my car
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
All My Children in the daytime, Dallas at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
Til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so
Don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Leave Here,On the Strength,UnKnown,"Put your clothes on, and get your feet off my couch
I think it's time that?you?left my house
I?tried to let you know that?you have a friend
But now you're actin' like you wanna?move?in
You?have problems, nowhere?to go
But now?you're stayin' like you're runnin' the show
And when I come in my house all I see
Is your back in my fridge (Got the back in your fridge!)
I don't like that eatin' up the food that I brought my girl
You just messin' up both our worlds
She can't even walk around, but you're always lookin'
You was horny, you stop 
 that you just can't have, and I'm mad
So get the  back and take out the trash
And on your way out
Ay yo, I think you better stay out

So you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
'Cause this is my house
Get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here, right now

You used to be my homeboy, I'll never forget you
But when you leave let the door knob hit you
In your back side, 'cause what's fair is fair
But please take those dirty underwear
Out the bathroom, I wonder what you been drinkin'
, the smell got your whole house stinkin'
I shoulda never let you get in here
Like Richard Pryor says, it smells like shit in here, word
Your underarms had a bad day and
Look like your Right Guard, all went the wrong way
Don't , don't need no deodorant
So drop the soap, 
You talk all the time, say rhymes 
The sneakers piled up, lookin' like a pyramid
Your girl stinks, she's just straight up jinx
She got missing teeth, like Leon Spinks
She might as well, go kiss Joe Frazier
She looks like a pitbull, but her in a cage

So you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
'Cause this is my house
So get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here

You, you're in violation
Actin' like you're on vacation
In the White House, but his my house
And you're 
Watch out, homeboy, I said you got no 
A buster in my kitchen, drinkin' my 
Wearing my clothes, for you they're too small
Always on the phone, you never paid for a call
And those lies, that you can't see
Homeboy, when you're gonna leave
All mistakes been made in a field that I made it
You can not , but I can't fake it
Opportunity's knockin', you know I gotta state again
Get out of my house 'cause I just can't take it

And you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
This is my house
Get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here, right now

You got bad feet, you don't get no sex
Corns and bunions (Don't blame )
Fungus, bacteria, your exterior
Your odour is superior, even my interior
Decorator told me that you had to move out
You don't blend with the cushions, you clash with the couch
Your girl came by, with extensions in her hair
Huh, and when she left, fake hair was everywhere

My bathroom, my kitchen, even my stash
I sat down, got up, and my butt had a mustache
The day you moved in, you didn't give me a 
To top it all off, you broke my favorite lamp
You screwed up the stereo and blew the amp
The next thing you know, you was settin' up camp
You said you wasn't stay here long, you're just a liar
I came in the living room, you made a camp fire
Roastin' marshmallows, beans, and franks
You ate, you burped, and you didn't say ""thanks""

So you, get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here
'Cause this is my house
Get out of here (Leave here)
Get out of here, right now",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-flash-and-the-furious-five-leave-here-lyrics
