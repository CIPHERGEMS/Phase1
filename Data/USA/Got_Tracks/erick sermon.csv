I'm immaculate, come through masculine
Wide-body frame, E-Dub's the name whoa
In the field of rap, I'm superb, I'm fly
I should be in the sky with birds (*caw caw caw*)
I ride twenty inch rims when I lean yo

Come through storm the block like El Niño
Scoop up an Arabic chick before she close
She goes (Kisi ko)

Mug me, I ain't got nothin' but four figures
And weed and hash chopped in the coffee blender
My shots like squeegee men on your window
Usual Suspect, I'm the crippled member
Get away when I sat down in the office
Heat in my lap keep me walking awkward
While y'all talk it, the doc reinforce it
The mic, it's hard to keep my paws off it
Your bitch is my bitch when it's over
No Cristal, I pulled up a King Cobra
Out in the Nova, don't bother
My Nino Brown bust, it'll shut down the corridor

Sparks when I rock the mic like Sigel and Free
When the pen hit the pad, the evil in me come out
Total Recall for people to breathe
I got dogs in the backyard shitting in lawns

Round and round we go, circle the area

Enough's enough, the stuff y'all releasing
Had to call Method Man up to start beasting
Everybody scared to speak up

Never wrote a verse sitting in a cell
But I'm cold with it, a little sickle in his cell
Chicks love a nigga they tripping on his cell
And I tell 'em my album out, hit me with a sale
My bruh said when I rap, talk to 'em
I said cool I might as well, harpoon 'em

Keith Murray's, comin from the North South East and Left
Rhymin to death, makin the world want to take a deep breath
With a body boom bash
My paragraph portrays dual human behavior in a psychopath
Ooooh, I might lose my cool, and break fool
And pull out my get busy tools
I write like a mad journalist
To funk, that's deeper than a bottomless spliff (that's my word)
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is my notion, for murderous poetry in motion
And the illiotic shit I come across
Form a leash you're trapped in with explosive force
I push your head through the cracks of sanity
And leave your brain doin a bid in purgatory
It's ninety-six degrees in the shade
Before I catch blood on my blade
I take my frustration to the stage
And gets open dope and stupid bumpin rumblin tracks
When I rap my jams be packed like a laundromat
My context'll wreck your whole concept
Cause my delivery is so complex
And I'm inter-galactic on plastic
With the super distinguished shit I kick
I'm high strung at the top of my lung
With my tongue makin hardcore niggas wanna get dumb
My dialogue comes straight from the slums
Damaging your medula, cerebrum and cerebellum
If ya got a crew ya better tell em

To your city, on the Zapp side with the vibe
I'm Stone Cold like Bobby and Ralph T
I come with the Game of Death, without Bruce Lee
The irregular speakin, for those MC's who be tweakin
Catch me at the Beacon just freakin
Chorus:
Brothers can't see me                                \
Cuz my style's the bom-digi-bom-uh-dang-a-dang-digi  / repeat 2X
...
Brothers can't see me
Verse Two:
It goes one for the trouble, two for the show
Aiyyo, I'm gettin airplay like 
The Most Beautiful
I'm the mack, I made Goldy turn chrome
When I induce my styles upon the microphone (yeah)
I goes down for y'all in broad daylight
Weeded, rockin the mic like ta-dow and psych
Today is a Green Day, so it's blazin
To specify it, I get big-up from Jamaicans
Hey, the E-R-I-C-K gets down for the public
More doper than Janet Jackson's stomach
Ask anybody, who's the dopest producer?
I think of cruise, I'm never too much like I'm Luther
My style is the craziest
No crew is fadin us
You got beef with my squad you better dare that
The shit I kick make rappers say, ""I should've said that""
Chorus
Verse Three:
Complete this puzzle, what Squad be Def like Russell Simmons
And more flyer than Robin Givens
Cosmic Slop, from the darkside
Basically, I Can't Wait, songs from the Redman tape
(and make much sense when he's kickin fool) cause I constantly keep shitting
And y'all constantly keep listening
Yeah, who can it be now, watch out
Flying through the air with wings E Double doing my thing
Chorus",https://genius.com/Erick-sermon-bomdigi-lyrics
Hittin’ Switches,No Pressure,1993.0,"Yeah, this is Colorado from Shadz of Lingo
Kickin it with the Funklord himself, E Double
Hittin' switches, and we bout to get stupid
So you know, yo E,! 
(Hey young world)
 check it

Ah yeah one two, hey young world, hey young world (""It's on!"")
Mic check, here I go again, check me out
Bust the flavor (""heYYYYYyyyy"") you know my clout
Rough and rugged -- funk's the contact I hit you with
To make your head split, trip and do a backflip
I swing it hardcore like an orangutang
I bring it wicked, and freak the funk slang
Like god damn, yea dude gnarly, fuckin A
I don't Play-Doh, my nickname ain't Clay
It's the E Double, mackaframa, bust the grammar
My style is sickening, like Roseanne-ah
Plus, I'm funky like _Atomic Dog_
Boy you can't see me, I'm thicker than fog, so
Save that drama, here's a floppy disk don't risk it
Boo-yaa, that's my biscuit!
On the mic, I cover every angle
A square, tri-part to a rectangle
I mean dat wit a passion, so be it
When I rock the mic it's worth seein
So cop a squad and parlay bitch
With the E-R-I-C-K, while I'm hittin' switches

Off and on, off and on, it's on 
Hittin' switches!

Ah shit, it's part two, it's on with the funk so
RING THE ALARM, ding! While I drop the bomb
On the country, E's gettin funky word to mother
I smother, any emcee or so-called brother
Why? I gets busy, who the hell is he?
The roughneck from New York City
You wanna mess around with the ill bastard
Then get your ass kicked, messin with the click
Def Squad, now on location, with the funky sensation
You wanna step you must be freebasin
Punk, why you playin, you bored?
You can't afford, to get choked by the mic cord
I keep you drunk like whiskey, solve the mystery
Ummmm, without 
Agatha Christie
 (there we go)
You think you know _What's Going On_
Without Marvin Gaye around
, c'mon let's get down
I spark your brain with all funk material
And gettin wicked, and let Wilson Pickett
Before I break, let me announce - get the bozack
Now we all can bounce, as I'm hittin' switches


(Switch) Back in effect mode, droppin loads
Watch me explode with the devil in me like crossroads
And ding-a-ling-a-ling with the guitar, freak the funk speech
Make the contact strong as bleach
Rock the mic make the vibes right, and plus dy-no-mite
So I can fly high like Mike and ""Just Do It""
And get freaky-deaky on the real, grab the steel
In case there's caps to peel
In the mix, when I flex the context, beware
Like when you're havin safe sex
I continue to get brand new, one two
My mic held tight, so I can recite the hype
And get busy, my name is Erick Sermon
Back for the Adventure, without Pee-Wee Herman
For those who don't know, don't act suspicious

This is my openin, E comin at ya lazy style
Versatile, crazy wild with my profile
Dominatin the microphone, on my own
Freakin it, with the ill vocal tone
Outspoken, here's a token of my appreciation
I bring drama like Jason
Who can see me?  You better ask Superman
For his super vision, cause I'm on a fuckin mission
Test my skills, and I rearrange your fuckin grill
Will kill if I have to get ill
Get away, carry on, and step
Like the S1's, cause my crew carry big guns
To blow up, anybody in the range
And plus I'm bad as Michael Jackson, even though he +Dangerous+
E Double with the funk type shit
This is it, so get with the skit motherfucker

I still get loose in the rap vocal booth
I know I can, I can like a train caboose
Smoke up the hardcore scene when I be rappin
I make it blacken yo, and make things happen
Why?  I'm like the Michael Jackson of rap
I'm bad, plus I moonwalk over tracks
I am still, so a-mazin
I flex, punk and get funky for the occasion
Superstitious, so I kill black cats and all that
And buck em down with the gat
E Double in the house don't you know me
What's up homey loc, step and you get smoked
I have a dream like Martin Luther King
That one day, yo, I can do away
With the pitiful, and the critical wack MC's
Seperate the ocean, and throw em in between
Grab my nuts, hold em, becaues they're golden
With more wins than Hulk Hogan
It's the future, of a dope producer
On the rise, the hype is my green eyes

Aowww, part three!
Shhhhh, quiet, your rap style's tired
The stores can't sell it, the fans won't buy it
Hell no - even if it was sold at an auction
Boy get rid of it, like an abortion
Word is bond, you made a mistake
And struck out, while I'm home safe at the plate
Def Squad, act like you know, backed by Russell
And that word to me means dough
Cause look -- I've been rich and I've been poor
Now I'm back in the door hardcore
So whattup Duke peace to the crew
Def Squad's in the house gettin wrecktafied beaucoup
Motherfucker!

Relentless,"Chilltown, New York",2004,"Yeah, all day yeah, uh
Turn me up, uh-huh...it's serious
Headphones turn me up
{Recordings indistinct)
This is somethin that you need to hear
It's cool and capture
I feel like Blondie caught in the rapture
Rappers and those who try to offend me
From false accusations they had heard from Wendy (Hello Erick)
I'm in the game to play
For those cats on the sideline callin me gay, huntin
Don't be the broads cause niggas
Mad cause I'm baggin chicks that look as bad as Jigga's (tell 'em)
And make seven figures, a rap icon
I'm the one kid in the biz to keep your eyes on
Me, Superman, I fell from the window
If I fly high, then why drive a benzo
In drive a 'lac, in drive a hummer
In drive is something brand-new this summer (tell 'em)
The operator, I got your number
Don't act like I don't flow like water, call the plumber (uh-huh)
Something tryna stop the E from gettin large
I feel like the Beastie Boys in Sabotage
In all five boroughs, I pissed on trees
I'm a dog (arroo), ask Rockwilder please
There's some fake cats, they talk behind me
A few A&R's sayin they won't sign me (uh-huh)
Cause they see my face and think I'm done
Meanwhile, I'm the black Neo, yes the one (one)
While they sign they brother or friend or they man
That's supposed to blow, he's a no-show
And that's why the game is shutdown
Every major player that's in it, been changed around (tell 'em)
But I'm still standin and got something to say
The boy is still here like LL and Dre
I sat down with Russell and Def Jam team
I sat down with Suge and Jimmy Ivine
I sat down with Sylvia, sat down with Tommy
Sat down with Clive Davis and no favors
I got booked at dark
And this might be my last huh-rah
I'ma rock now until tomorrow
Some ask about EPMD's prognosis
But it won't happen til P get focused
I won't be compared to Nas or Jada
But I'mma punish the game for it's foul behavior
And y'all got it backwards
Those ain't real MC's, those is actors
Cast of Fear Factor (tell 'em)
I agree with Missy
No creativity in the game no more
It's the same old bore
A few people in the biz know what's happenin
The fans don't know, they think I'm platinum
Cause they hear the record gettin played 4,000 times on every station
But at the same time hate...disc jockeys
If I'm over, explain how I do it
In 2001 I shut it down with ""Music"" (hmmm)
If I'm whack, why in 2002, yes it's true, I made cats react (uh-huh)
Source might not quote this here
It might not be nothin but I wrote this here
Like Eminem said, you wanna be Erick Sermon (that's the truth)

If your not with me freeze back the hell up

Kid Capri, Flex, S, Clue or Biz
It is off the lid, spot's type crazy
Cats up in here got more bling than Baby
I'm not ice rockin crystal poppin
The type to rebound with chicks I'm not Rodman
I gotta girl with a butt big as Trina's
And green eyes but mines are greener
(I'm Hot) I keep it simple like add and subtract
One color, everything I rock is black
Like that black chick black whips
Black AMEX card brand new never ran it

I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh
I'm hot, I'm hot just like an oven ooooh

Ay yo!!!! we are
My name's drama that's why it starts with ER

I'm a master with a mic and green jacket
They can be the traffic write somethin and run it
Add a hot boy threw with me and stun it
(I'm Hot) Still cats wanna outlash me
I'll smash outlast your best MC
Make him trash that cd, crash that seat
Head bang thru the window when he heard the E

Uh, feel the music get into come on (Now baby let's get down tonight)
Yo stop the hate, appreciate (Now baby let's get down tonight)

Verse 3 uh, lights out let's bounce
Get it crunked, before the last songs announced
T Braxton heat, track I burn
While you go left, I make a right turn

Breaker breaker one nine roger copy that

Flavorishis, mackadoshis, sour cream and onion type flavor
Redman:
I rule the world like Kurtis Blow with my afro blown out
I'm torn out the frame, drunk style stagger like Ned the Wino
For black albinos, I'm like suicidal on vinyl
The type of antidope you have to keep away from minors
And I'm the, bombest rhymer, check my steez
My vocals are like vaginas, wettin' MC's when they open
My identities, blows facilities to ememies please test these abilities
I'm rugged, plus pack a 24 studded, karrot automatic, 45 nigga slugger
So ring thee alarm, when your TV is on, I react freakin' to songs
When bitches see me perform, bitches get wet
Then I inspect them like Deck,
 check my resume says I strictly break vertebrates
Bones back, chinky eyed like Japs I blow states off the map
Just by eye contact
Hook:
Don't get it twisted and if you do, you best to move on move on
""Rock, rock on"" - Redman (x4)
Erick Sermon:
Yeah, I shut down things for the moment, what?
Paying my does for them fake ass crews (yeah)
Who be claimin' to be the shit? Y'all stop
Gimmicks, hard core lyrics for an image

Cleats
I let one nigga slide in 93, but this year, he's fuckin' history

Passion:
Strick nine rules the mind on the verge of destruction
Blood starts to boil like a lyrical combustion, eruption
Insane no pressure no pain, niggas falling off it's strain to maintain
They be killing me, trying to preach to me, teach to me
I got a PHD in funkology
You got your bachelors and your masters in the field of dramatics
The lyrical are bringing the static from the attic, so cock your automatics
I've had it up to here, you niggas are in danger
You better stand clear, no hugs no love and kiss mainstream America
They just ain't ready for this, cause I'm nice as shit
Niggas be having fits, the Squad of Def be smacking hits after hits
And what's goin' on in your mind I can feel it
Tremors in the body has caused for the healin'
Hook (x4)
Outro:
You know what I'm sayin'? Things is hot in the tunnel out in here you know

Two thousand (""FOUR"") means a brand new motor
Phoenix, capitol of Arizona
But that means nuttin, I'm just sayin somethin
Spare the moment them niggas is suspect
I took a line from Keith Murray off his first cassette
I never took my dog to the vet
And I download songs off the net
But you would rather hear some rapper brag
Meanwhile, bombs bein dropped over Baghdad

Can you hear me now? Good
Can you hear me now? Good

Cheating cause I wrote down Brat

The Underground Kingz in the building, pimpin
Oh no, they must be feelin me
Pinch me now, this don't feel real to me

Knew she wasn't first class cause her bag was Coach
She was like, ""Redman! Buy me boots.""
So I, bought her Timbs, and a army

Nobody want it with Doc, you smell me Duke?

That ain't fair, that ain't the way the street work
This is street hop, nothing about pride
For you, I'mma keep them ambulances outside, you dig?


All them rappers that can't rhyme (can't rhyme)
What you're doing is a crime
Saying that garbage all the time
{*chk-chk-BOOM*} Word up, yeah

That's how I'm livin, still a gangsta, still a pimpin mack
All around hustler, 9 to 5 flippin crack
Tryin to stay up out of prison, steady spittin raps
Not to mention spittin scraps, don't mix your puddy-tat with that
(Meow) Dhark Citi, put it on your map
Don't ride through without your pistol, put it on your lap
And I don't look for beef but don't think that I won't attack
Have you in a coffin momma like, ""He don't belong in that""
You shoulda thought of that before the fact
Why a nigga roll the dice, lose all they money, then they want it back?

That's my nigga, we get down from ""How High""
To ""Get Lifted"", down to ""Golddigger""
Yo, I am that monumental
The rap superstar with mad credentials
Yo, I rip over instrumentals
To make you squint your eyes like orientals
A, high school diploma, mastered the art of music
It's my title, doma
That's spanish for ""gimme that"" for those wondering
When I speak, lightning and thundering, uh
Me and Redman be up in Hell's Kitchen daily
I see a few rap cats around there barely
Scared to get out the car
While I keep it real like Buckwild and Star baby pah
Def Squad be the best by far
I rock New York then Motown like (?)
Yup, my name rings bells (bells)
This year I'm confident so yo homes watch the sales

Yo, I lamp out in the RENNtech E7 V12 screamer
The new Benzina
290 thou', wow
Somethin' your rap budget does not allow
Why you laughin'? I don't see nuttin funny
Pull back two Mac-10's, now it's a big Mac-20
That there's the basics, Quik and I we run the Matrix
Close your mouth, don't say shit
Walk through any borough
That stretch from here past the Triborough
Better respect us dog, we thorough
Don't get confused, we smashin' crews, it's my rules
Step incorrect and get abused
I bring the ruck to any cats bringin' drama
Make 'em feel it, like 2Pac's ""Dear Mama""
It can be pitch black and I'll spot ya
Boom! Kick in your door like Big Poppa

Tell me what you get when your nigga Xzibit
And Quik get down with the E Double? (What?)
You get we trouble
E, make the beat bubble
Make the bass so low you shake they brick house to the ground and dig 'em out of thee rubble
Partyin', happy that you shook the whole crib
And if you got a pound, E Dub, I got dibs
'Cause this is how we do it here, it's ironic
That you done stepped into a room of purple hydroponic
Fat booty bitches sparklin', tryin' to take you to a star
Tryin' to get you to recognize they know who you are
Can't you see the red carpet, they lay it out
And if you got a fantasy, Erick, they play it out
We big figure rap niggas; from the gate
We been waited on and hated on since '88
Now cross my dogs or cross my path and I'mma wet ya
Way down from the Compton town, and I betcha they...

Never understood, how we did it

How we made this music groove your very soul

I'm the spin doctor, Phantom of the Opera
If this was '89, I would break you off proper
Cockblocker, dump a few G's in my lolo
Not dough, hoe, my nigga Big KAM and Solo
Dolo, most niggas react like a homo
And when they with a crowd then they wanna get loud
Wanna act wild and act like their criminal file
Is stretching a mile, but really got the heart of a child
Splicing your mind to steal our chickens
Extra points like a field goal kick-in
Like a fucked up D.A. with a charge that ain't stickin'
I'm walkin' away, a free man
'Cause y'all niggas softer than sand
'Cause we fuckin' a fan in Okinawa, Japan
I fucked your mother, so now I'm the motherfucking man!
Break fool on the track like it's supposed to be
And break bread with the real niggas close to me

Funky dilemmas, destroy MC's by process of elimi-
Nation, ghetto lingo breaks your inner
Mind body, got me sold like Hurachis
Fuck tracks up the ass, make beats walk knock-kneed
The funk dwella in your cella, no one's wetta
Pull more Playboy bitches than Hugh Hefner
I played you wit my nasal style I'm able
To rock two turntables for old sake like Sweet Sable
Now who's on the deals, I'll make you feel the real
I kill at will wit nine shots in your window shield
Or mill, so feel the gust of wind
I must've been born with ten of my dusted friends (Ahhh)
I get up in you like Keith Murray
Make your whole crew shit stew beef curry, in a hurry
Make competition leave early, smokin the lala
Blazay Blah come through your block and open fire
(Redman's in the area
Keith Murray's in the area
Erick Sermon's in the area)

Is this mic on word up
I swarm like helicopters, after robbers, at banks gettin dollars
The lyrical Street Fighter call me Sagat
Blazin hot, like a bullet from somebody gettin shot
Where there's a drum there's a beat
And where there's guns there's a street
This option allows me to bake my opponents wit degrees
From here to overseas
Clowns in my mix and don't know the flava
Its the same reason why I threw away my Skypager
Magnificent, givin rappers, death certificates
With fly intricate flows by the loads
Y'all come out the hype description of this
One time Billboard winner, six time Gold record list
No one invited me so I crashed and brung the vibe
And broke it out like a rash, who? (who? who?)
So who do I be? The E the D, O-U-B the L to the E
Get your blunt leafs and fire it up
Get your ZigZags and fire it up Whhhoooo!
MC's you betta stand clear, Def Squad is a world premier
The one and only Philly Blunt king

Word is bond the lyrical lexicon gets it on like a moron
I break your little itty bitty style down to ions
My rap style has many many mixtures
Of murderous poetry and deadly lectures and pictures
Matter fact my rap Sounds be on sickly timin
Meaning your brain can't be defined
In the words I be using when I be rhymin
Now you can shake the whole world back and forth
Bring your roughest rapper, and I bet you blood he'd cough
My rap style is like my lifestyle, rougher than turbulence
Ever since I commenced to subject you to my bullshit
I compress your chest and perform open-heart surgery
And God forbid I bring Reggie, P.P.P. and the L.O.D
I love beatin you in the head with this
Make you wanna run off and go get a psychotherapist analyst
(He's way nicer) than you false pretenders
The nicest rapper that ever came out since you could remember

 - New York, word up

Respect my views on this day and era
Keep your eyes upon me, and not the sparrow of berettas
I'm fly, than any bird on this earth
For what it be, my style is butter like Worth
I freak the beat like I'm lost in the twilight
A zone with no phone, looking over parasites
I pack the house like Woodstock when I rock
A three day event of me dropping the illest shit
From here to New Jerz, back to Brooklyn and Queens
To Uptown to Bronx River, I still deliver
The off the wall for y'all
Rearranged cameo-type strange pumping through your veins
What your mommy do, if you're not ready to die like Biggie
I'ma keep jamming like Ziggy
I got the air waves wiped down like Funkmaster Flex
Sway and Tech
, and Premier, and we in here

 It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
 You are welcome


Now, it's on like that once again, it's getting hot
Now it's time to blow up the spot
For my niggas out there on the block getting money
Playas whose hustling, doing their thing
But me, I've lounged without the stone
Do it for my peeps, take it to the streets
All day, everyday, I sets the mood
Parabellum eye , with new attitudes
I change not for the words, but for the better
And be a trend-setter, and bring the best ever
Yeah, teach me for the president
So I can bring the vibes through your residence (E Double!)
The ghetto blast, the green eyed rapper slash producer
And O.J. with the juice, uh!
Y'all know me, it's the E-R-I-C-K
So enjoy the day, and peace to Marvin Gaye

 It's on like that! And everybody's welcome!
 You are welcome


Let's groove back and forth like Aaliyah
If you ain't got the vibe, then I wouldn't want to be ya (see ya)
I threw it like a rap attack from New York to Hackensack
Kiss myself and jump back, surprise like a Crackerjack
The eye can bring the smiles without Shanice
And make enemies call truce, or even peace
Funk Lord fights back
Again without the Force of Luke Sky, Chewbacca, R2D2 and the crew
The miracle worker (God praise him, praise him!)
All of them ready for the funk, you feel like you want like (blaaah!)
Whatever you requested, and you suggested
That I bring the pain like Method
It's nothing nice, cause I'm down for whatever

Funky fuckers
Erick Sermon:
Y'alll guess what the fuck is going on now
Me and Reggie Noble, making funk tunes around the global
Cause times keeps on slippin', and I get the funk from the kitchen
Then commits to ass whippin', there is no time for me to bust it
So I'm a chill and let Red get into a fly poetic justice
Redman:
Yo, it's all in the mind and I'm high and I kick it for the do or die
On 2 or 1 area code, leavin' shit blown
Funkadelic is the one to bring the creature out your preacher
And I make girls act like they can't find they shoes when I freak 'em
Oooh, yes y'all I got the mad method can you catch it?
And if your ear's not tuned in then adjust it
Erick Sermon:
Breaker 1-9, breaker 1-9 representin' today
Hey, Erick Sermon's on the way
Dre gave me a ride
 so I Gangsta Lean while DRS will put the smoke in my chest
And if you understand me then escape and kick it
While the E-Double gets wicked with your brain twisted
It's going down, it's going way down
Go get the 4 pound and boogie down
Redman:
Boogie boogie to boogie to bang, boogie to that
My rap get mad dap on ass cracks in effort if it's BMI or ASCAP
Cause my funk rolls thicker than 
Bisquick
If it's mixed with that same funky sticky stuff I roll my spliffs with
I shot the sheriff on the terrace
And I kick the funk like these to have 
more off days than Ferris
Just wrote these raps up in the studio
Brothers can't tell and sisters can't hear me though (hear me ho)
Hook:
E got the funk, Red got the funk, Red got the funk, E got the funk (x2)
Erick Sermon:
Someones knockin' at my door, yo Johnny Gill, I need the whole floor
So I can get busy remember? And if you don't call Michael Jackson
And don' be afraid to ask him, Erick Sermon got mad tunes
No matter what they say, I got more props than Richard Bay
The mind bogglin' with the hardcore followin'
So what's up, cause I don't give a fuck
Redman:
Whoa, I make you sing with Toni Braxton
I tear the shreds out of jams in stadiums when it's packed in
Back up boy you messing with the rudeboy yes I told ya
I rock leather jacks with Timbs, sweatpants; one leg rolled up
Hold up! This is a stick up, I spark the izm
The 'boom-kick' like a Biz cut, one twos and skirts'll lift up
E got the funk and Red got the funk, pop the trunk
I got blocks of funk to make a victim say ""That's the one!""
Of course, I'm funky like fat people having intercourse
Basically the funk's stuck in your teeth so get your dental floss
Oh oh, freak out, 20 & over let me knock your teeth out
When I was young I made my tree house to a weed house
And I'm deeper than Nostradamus
, swimming in chronic
And I leave your kitty cats meow in home made bondage (meow)

Testing, microphones are o-o-on

New York, stand up! (I don't care!)

Yeah, I'm on the block, man (chillin!)

And I get the paper so (I don't care!)

MC, and ma, people call me Whip
I'm just (chillin) all alone, no one to be with, man
I took long, but I'm finally here
The most anticipated chick of the year, cheaugh
I came to flip and reverse game
Every dude I touch get whipped lie my first name, and
Although I'm prissy, don't get it confused
I don't need to mess with you, I got plenty of dudes
Got the caramel skin, on the parallel twin
Heads keep turning like a carosel spins
I know for a fact, these women are sick
Cause these hoes can't mess with this Dominican chick
Got the flag on my arm, it proves I am the bomb
All I do is speak Spanish and it works like a charm
I been ready, cause I payed my dues
Yo, this goes out to my Brooklyn crew
Yo (I don't care)

You might catch me on the train, OK, I'm just (chillin!)
I ain't too big for the game, I'm just (chillin!)
I got the whole Red Hook with me (chillin!)

Y'all non-rapping chicks can keep (chillin!)
Talk if you want, cause (I don't care!)

Ayo, E is chillin! Kwe is chillin!
Whip in the house, Brooklyn in the building
Blood on the dance floor, sweat on the ceiling
When you get that feeling that gun concealing is a hobby
Nobody stealing shows like Kweli
Working on a new project while you chillin in the lobby
Keep it thorough, ain't real, guns don't kill
People kill people, but the Sun don't chill
But still, I stand cooler than a Minnesota winter
Nigga, hotter than the blocks where guns bust over dinners
Plus, all the sinners got dreams they running after
Working a 9 to 5 now is like you hustling backwards
That's why all these young girls in love with the rappers
Basketball players, and up-and-coming actors
Swimming with the sharks, and flirting with disaster
When the things you own start owning you, they your master
Yeah! (I don't care)

I got the yak in the back of the club, I'm just (chillin!)
With Whip and my nigga E Dub, we just (chillin!)
Nobody give a fuck about you, we (chillin!)
But I smack the shit out you, like (I don't care!)
So if you really want to know how it is, I'm just (chillin!)

Where did the game go?
Where
Where did the game go?

Huh, the game takin' a turn for the worst
Niggas makin’ whatever, doin' it for the thirst
The money and the women, the fame for the position
To be number one, got 'em trappin’ in the kitchen
Cookin' up that white girl, oh yeah, I get it
Everybody a dealer, it goes with the gimmick
The rest of them mimic like they the new Jeezy
Make a couple of records, thinkin' it's just easy
Shit, this the streets, motherfucker, it's beef in it
Niggas don't give a fuck, you see Chief Keef in it
They ain't your friends, ask a stranger
They wanna see you dead
The other people who hungry don't wanna see you fed
The Devil’s a liar, he bring whatever you want in your face, that’s fire
The proper attire
Oh, look at that round fat, brown skin, few tats, hair black
That's not where I was goin’, I was showin' ya niggas the mirror
To see your nonsense way clearer, here's the picture
Hold up, wait a minute, Erick Sermon puttin' on a clinic
Spittin’ up authentic (Mmh), likin' the way I pen it
My team is hittin', like we ran the pendant (Ball game)
I love those thinkin' I'm over (Uh huh)
I pull up, left foot out the Rover
Some ain't believin' it (Nah)
I'm chillin', motherfucker, milk with D in it
I ain't ask to be in it, I was destined for seein' it
So why you wan' try me?
Sayin' I'm washed up, today I used ivory
Everybody askin' me, where I been (Uh huh)
I'm out in Mexico, homie, with Carlos Slim
Everybody askin' who's him?
The richest man on the planet
I'm gettin' that money, goddammit

When you turn on the radio (Ooh ooh)
When you lookin' at the video
It's just the same old (Same old)
Where did the game go? (I don't know)
It's all the same, it's all the same
I'm like
Where did the game go?

Ah, from the era the crack wars
Rubber band stacks, fitted caps, and rap tours
Certain plug was let in the backdoor
We show love 'cause this is what that's for
Fly dude, destroyer of Yaku
Dutches and fried food
Fuck, it was my move
Vibes rule, spoke what we felt then
Like jailed men, nothin' was held in
I tell spendin' the coupe with no roof
Off that 40 proof, the spook with the gold tooth
Flow the truth, I know the booth
Been about it, got photos as a youth
Salute, my trap raps was facts
Attack tracks in black, these rap cats is wack
Bring it back, that feel good when it still hood
Big would if still alive, his skills could

I don't play the radio, I ain't watchin' no videos (Uh uh)
In the juice bar just buildin' with the Millennials (Facts)
Everybody sound the same, everybody look the same (
Same ol', same ol'
)
I'm cut from a cloth of them old school criminals (Cut from that)
Keep that fake shit to a minimal
Matter fact, don't even do it 'cause I'm a general (Don't even do it)
I ain't got time for no industry lies from a industry guy, I'm in the G5
Homies catch a sting like we in the beehive
Got beef? We don't go to sleep, let the heat fly (We let it fly)
Like them birds goin' south
Yeah, I splurge goin' out and I swerve goin' out
Come around the curve, hit second and third, then I'm out (Out)
Fast life make you holla, told E-Dub
I'm the other P makin' dollars gettin' high
Pray to God that I'm gonna see tomorrow

Yo yo, I pause for the cause
I seen niggas heads busted, someone pass the gauze
This rhyme may affect the skull to a point
And crash the membrane, so you should spark a joint
*inhale* There I go and now it's Showtime without
KiKi Shepherd, now the bitch feels neglected
Check the memo, remember you listened to my demo;
Yeah the one about the fuckin limo?
Rewind because I'm pushed for time right now
What where when how, my sound's out there like Moscow
I hear nuttin but the music, raw fusion
No mass confusion or illusion
Blink blink, blink so what you sayin?  I'm not playin
Hey man, yo I caught you playin
So don't be conspicous, cause you can't get with this
Hardcore scientifical, far from typical
My rap style, is dy-no-mite
It make you wanna be like the E Double, and not like Mike
Yo, bust my acoustics, SWING!
Deranged, when I rock the mic I feel strange
Now back to our program, fuck Batman, bang bang

Let me quit it, cause I feel I have shitted

As Erick Sermon's, we's the ones usin the method slurrin
So Joe Sinistr came through the armed recruit to blank crews
My six will fix another one greedy
FOREAL, let's peel they hats back for deal slow
And we'll catch clown, with they pants down REAL LOW
The screwball better work a RuPaul and switch fast
Or we'll be in the cornfield, killin your bitch ass
And Timb's roam through bad bad odor but it is home
Wild flex and more sex than Mad Cobra
So take it easy ?just to mash a kraut? mine's the cheesiest
And I'm sworn to keep their eyes on more than CBS
I make the Funk Doobie turn to a process
I mob just any nigga, I don't care who he
I still get doughs, takin off bitches Girbauds
And lamp with Erick, a champ merit cause I flip foes
See these screws loose, I repeat, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
But stop there goes the third time with the cock-a-roach
And I get more flows than Vic Tayback
So kids, here come the second big payback
Chorus 1/2
Verse Three: Erick Sermon, Joe Sinistr
*tire squeeling sound* I return burnin rubber
The black African brother, low key so call me undercover
The funkster from the boonies
I love Muhammad Ali, so FUCK Gerry Cooney
Oops, can't forget, under a roof from One Nation
*rrraow* Crowd participation
Shit, I'm so upset, I feel like snappin niggas neck
But I'mma chill and let Joe get wreck
My secret recipe put Pepsi on Diet's, uh-huh
The funk dog as I come low to piss on hydrants
And howl at half moons and White Owls and mad tunes
Live quite fowl, leavin Lifestyles in bitches bathrooms
I crack granite, and pack a mass transit it's so weird
My style is more Fear-ed than Black Planets
And I fuck your shit, suck my dick for explicit
I let clips at your name, pay rent in your brain
And I gets wicked, wick-wick-wicked
And keeps a full clip in case the bullets get evicted
And now to twirl up the fat nigga, seek psychiatric
I devour worlds and Galactus
I gets mean troop, grabbin Christine around the block
At sixteen, spittin the green pea soup
And cock nines, when niggas got slime, the only men
Puffin Nick Nick Nick's- with -elodeon
It's Joe no diss cause the funk mist flow
Make a mess like Aunt Tess when she leaped off the sixth flo'
So straighten it out if your knock-kneed
'fore they draw chalk around the body",https://genius.com/Erick-sermon-payback-ii-lyrics
Swing It Over Here,No Pressure,1993,"""Kick it over here baby pop!""
Chorus: Murray, Sermon, others
 Swing it over here!
 Yo swing it over here!
 Swing it over here!
 C'mon swing it over here!
 Y'all swing it over here!
 Yo swing it over here!
 Come swing it over here!
 Yo, swing it over there!
Verse One: Keith Murray
My rap style is swift like boom bips
So come get a whip, and a bump, it's rough
Crews couldn't hold it in handcuffs
The ordeal is that I'm raw ill on the mic
Switchin my styles up like a transvestite (word)
I think of competition as ?? and
Keith Murray is the vocabulary champ
?Come in against deep notable to breach lines?
I'll make you make the same mistake twice three or four times
And nobody got a style like this
You could say, I got my thinking cap on backwards
I'll demolish the retarded smartest rap artists
Regardless, tryin to scream the hardest
I fuck your head up like amphetamines with L.O.D
Then bend you out of shape like a master Yogi
I put my head through your chest, just to see
Who's next in line, just to get wrecked
I makes contact, bust the interlude
I take my skills to another level like qualudes
And you couldn't hear me out; cause the type of shit
I converse about'll drag your brain in the slaughterhouse
Chorus: change to  throughout
Verse Two: Erick Sermon
Cling cling, somebody tell me something
Why I got more props than Don King without bouncing boxing rings?
*ding ding* I be the flyest guy you ever sawr on the microphone
Rip the shit to pieces, so leave me alone
Check me out, the way I freak the mode
The active half flippin shit so split 'fore I explode - BOOM!
So umm, pay attention, before I put you and your crew on suspension
For being closed minded to my invention
Yo, I rock on reel when I record oh my lord
The world full of jackers so I keep my shit stored
When I rock the microphone I rock it right
And keep it hardcore and more blacker than Wesley Snipes
To my crew there's no match
You want more funk then here's another batch, yo I
Chorus:  throughout
""The Redman that's what they call me"" --] EPMD's 'Headbanger' (repeat 3X)
 Oh no, here comes the Funkadelic Redman
Verse Three: Redman
Aoowwwwwhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh my goodness! Could this be
The funk that I was stretching out my lungs
Funkadelic sums up *nasal inhale* I clear the mucus
Stick tissue up my nose to stop the snot from makin spots
To be or not I still give niggas polka dots for plots
Now Richard Dawson had a survey sayin that I was awesome
Throw on your Walkmans while I pour the funk sauce in your coffins
WAKE UP! While the blunt's laced up just to pick the pace up
My style's freaky, nasty like ?Seka? pussy papers
When I raped her, you don't know check the four-uno-uno you know
That funk mixture that gets your body, holy like scriptures
Now right about now I'm settin off a bomb to blow the Empire
To ashes -- cause my shit's more raw than niggas stashes
Massive funk, swingin bangin bent up while I fucked ya
I'm rough enough ta, fuck up another white man's trucker
Redman's evil like the board of ouiji, niggas could smoke
A whole pound of weed and couldn't see me off the TV!",https://genius.com/Erick-sermon-swing-it-over-here-lyrics
Safe Sex,No Pressure,1993,"Sex
Have some sex
Safe sex
Word 'em up
Okay, it's time for some action
A little passion, some booty waxin'
For the bozac, make sure he's strapped
And if baby got back, then yo, we with that
Call up a few people on the phone
Yo we're havin' a party, at my private home
Some bring some chronic, plus some brew
Call up your girl and invite her too
Come active and bring purple lactives
'cause we're gonna get more busy than gymnastics
And do the humpty hump all night
So when you come with the boy, make sure you're right
It's nine o'clock, party starts at ten
So enough for now, I'll talk to you then
Later, huh, I'll see you when you get here
And make it quick, ah yeah
Time for some safe sex

Safe sex
Safe sex
Safe sex
We all need (safe sex)
Ding dong, there goes the bell
I opened up the door and oh, what the hell
It was a buncha niggas standin' by my door
I said come in, but respect my floor
That means take off your shoes and englands
'cause I'm a gentleman, some say distinguished
All of y'all put your things up in the kitchen
And the rest of y'all sit down and listen
Be free and relax in what you're wearin'
Let's all be happy like Bobby McFerrin
And get loose and produce the funky juice
And let's swing this shit like they swing a forty deuce
They want some reggae, like some flex
Time to have sex
And it's all night, so turn off the light
And let's get high as a kite
And have safe sex

Somebody say sex (sex)
Say safe sex (safe sex)
I love it (I love it)
I need it (I need it)
But for real, when you're havin' sex
No matter what type, make sure you wear the latex
To all of the cons out there sexin'
Stop and look, boy, you're stressed out protection
Cause aids is real and something to beleive
Or not make-beleive and fake like hair weave
A death wish like Charles Bronson
And if you don't beleive me then ask Magic Johnson
About the sex",https://genius.com/Erick-sermon-safe-sex-lyrics

What's the 411?
Erick Sermon, Ice Cube, and KAM here to get the job done
So back the fuck up! I have an attitude, dude, I'm 'bout ta get rude
I'm buckin' out shots during my interlude
Right about now I'm 'bout ta get courageous like the cat
Got the gat in the corner of my back so get my bozack
American Dream, the people choice pick
I flip more vowels than Pat Sajak's white bitch
I'm bad, ask Michael Jackson's dad about the E-Double
The mack fram, the black superman
Made of steel, the mic I'm holdin' is a Samson
E-D the Green Eyed Bandit in raw fashion
I'm lettin' niggas know my territory
My grind is rugged. I kill a million niggas so fuck it!
Knick knack paddy wack, give a dog a bone
Once again it's on with the brand new song, yeah boy!

(""With the boom, ping-ping!
Listen to the ill shit that I bring-bring!"")

Goddamn, not KAM! But I'm afraid so
I lay low like a brick, quick to make a cameo
So hand me your eardrum 'cause here comes the 4-11
Little devils don't go to heaven
187 on a saltine cracker
Smack a, paranoid Caucasoid, don't make me have to act a fool
Watts up, now you can determine
The West Coast niggas is down with Erick Sermon
On the G tip, we trips hard on the opposition
Three niggas on a mission
So listen to the Ill Shit 'cause we'll get wreck!
What you expect! Fuck a rain, nigga, take a chin check!

(""With the boom, ping-ping!
Listen to the ill shit that I bring-bring!"")

Well here I go again, throwin' up the W
Ice Cube and I'm down wit' E-Double crew
Pullin' up in my homie's black 6-4
Hittin' switches but mine's a convertible
Mashed to the Westside, still got the deuce-deuce
'Cause some niggas don't believe in a gang truce
Heard some new shit, what is this? EPMD is goin' out of business?
Goddamnit! Can't leave my dog stranded
(Who?) The Green Eyed Bandit
Picked up KAM 'cause my nigga need a ride
Bumpin' ""Peace Treaty"" but still had the 4-5
Glock, cocked for the clown
Yeah, we down, pulled up in Echo Sound
Don't you know that we can drop 10 of these
Dope tracks, so fuck all my enemies

From uptown to the Twin Towers
Makin' a statement, once again, with no replacement
Erick Sermon comin' from the basement
I leave you blown away like Jeff Bridges
Mind boggling, cuttin' through ya brain like a pair of scizzors
When you see me at a show, don't bother grabbin' this microphone
I'm terra-fabulous with out it, holmes
Spritually, I'm like the holy ghost
I bring joy, to the average girl and boy
Def Squad, we got more faith than dick-ruckers
I feel sorry for any crew out there tryin to fuck us
I blind MCs, like Ray Charles while I'm drinking Pepsi
Which will kill(?), so don't test me
The super supreme, mackadose, ya host
Erick Sermon, representin for my coast

Just because you made a hit record
Don't make you a star in one year
Let's get things clear
 Free your minds! 

I rock the mic, safe and sound, like DJ Quik
In the mix, without packin' a M6
Bein up on the scene, 
eyes are green, no bullshit
Niggas sayin' they pull shit, but won't pull dick
Fake hardcore MCs with fake hardcore crews one in the same
Practicin' brand new gun names
And new swing, they sound more street
They gain more peeps so they won't let the (?)
Only west coast was kickin' that shootin' cops
Fuck that bitch shit, now we all on they dick
I represent The Bridge is Over, Eric B. for President
Gettin' Raw, Rockin' Bells, and Raising Hell
I ain't knockin' those out there keepin' it real with the steel
Yall know the deal
But if you ain't shot nobody, don't claim to be a John Gotti
Remember the days of La-Di-Da-Di


I been shootin' nine-mils, 45's since '89, Black
In the big payback (yeah)
I struck crazy jewels
I got robbed one time, yeah you sucka
But now the kid is gone, motha fucka
I had beef with one nigga after me and my group had broke up
At least from jail, and I woke up
So don't think I was a shook one, or scared
I laugh, I wanted to catch a charge for yo' black ass
I coulda commenced to beatin' you down in front of your bitch, but I didn't care
That year, I was a millionaire (yeah)
Don't try to play me, cause I got two million plaques on my walls
And you don't have the balls (yeah)
My squad is Def, and we don't hear nothin'
No time for frontin', tell me when you want somethin'
I jam like NBA

Can't hold back the shit, so I flip myself aside out
Dramatics, they act in classes, act what
Actin like suckers raw, act enough to get they ass whipped
Ask for the acts and ask for the axe
They get as actors, Beams, Navs, and Ac's
Still navigatin rap cats, attack on tracks
To flow til I fall off the atlas map
(And stomp a cat) til they frame mats to mat
Not my bloodtype, DNA mismatch

Enough to clean these preachers to the fifth pew
The shit stink like pee-yew, G2-D2
Versus R2-D2, please move peaceful
Bulbasar smash the Pokemon powers of Pikachu
Faced against Yui Oshamitsu
I speak in two's like I had two faces
Get deeper than Tomb Raiders, open and shut case
Like suitcases, Dark Forces couldn't take it
If you had NATO backed by Duke Nukem with two lasers
My true nature bite you and your face out
Leave you on the ground pointin finks out
Scatterin towards your safehouse, the illest nigga that's out
I brainstorm til the whole rap game get rained out
Don't make me get a hat and start pullin names out
Change the outfit, get the thang out
Make you wish you never came out, get laid out, without an 8-count
Get up, get out, and stop tryin to play house


Yo, don't exchange with E in exhibition, I'm a expert
Feelin the overexhausted from the leg work
Write hate mail through e-mail
Talk on my cell, my cell charged like D-cells
I hate the flows MC's they use these days
It's overused, used too much these days
E explain, X mark the spot, I rock the spot
E-Dub the name, and that's Sy Scott

Who wanna battle? The beat beat badly in battle
In battle I paddle like world-class battlers
In the heat of battle, true MC not abbreviation

Microphone tyrant, always comin sideways
And topsy turvy, lyrical crash-up derby

Unquotable sociable thirty-eight caliber style swayin

Darts'll damage ya dogs, where the U-Haul in my truck
The camera installed, hand upon my balls
Call the morgue I'm killin 'em
Even Kyle is not feelin 'em when I drill 'em with skills of ten Eminems
You feminine, don't even call my name
I stay locked down walkin with a ball and chain
Put the mac where you tongue at, I done that
These young cats'll get thumbtacked and sent where Big Pun at
Smoke so much the doc asked where my lung at
I took it out to stash my gun, son run that
Pop mega shit, I pop mega clips
Fuck a system, I keep the heat where your Sega sit
Then I bang the controller, 'til the game say 'Over'
In the Bricks we'll stick ya when ya plane lays over

Two-thousand nail me Sy Scott rap's newest Damien
It's humane punish ya maine
'Til no skeletal remains remain remain mainly main event
Man made disease that's made by man
Crackin the DNA code to see how God made man

Put microchips in they wristbands and make 'em raindance
Lay hands like Mike Strahand
Puttin ya face and hands in Ace bands

Flooded the market - got your mens on the wall
Holdin his blunt, too fucked up to spark it
Show me a nigga who can do like I do
Then gas your mans up so I can rip that nigga too
Braggin you goin platinum like that shit brand new

Come (?) L - what you call rocks to me is minerals
Tried to throw salt on my name, shit's political

Cram to understand it, I'll switch and write it lefthanded
Heat my pinky ring up and leave your bitch branded
Got a voice like a cannon - nigga shoot

I'm the best MC to ever touch the pen
Take a look at what I'm doin it will not be done again

Leave you in the truck, wrapped 'round ya wheel

You a trash-ass nigga, slash garbage-ass rhymer
You switched from the raw to a chart climber
And now your shit is blowin out the stores
And uh, next month you fin' to go out on the tour but
Count - (two, three, and, four)
Your records ain't sellin no more
And damn - you done spent your money galore
Buyin all the stupid shit that your money can't afford (uh-oh)
Tryin to keep up with the trendy
Got your bitch minked out in all Fendi
Bought your homeboy a brand new Bentley
And the well that wouldn't run dry is now empty
It's simply, cause you wasn't focused on the next day
And your next tape you can't give it away, but hey
I send these to these niggas tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Everything you see me I owns it
I've been quietly sellin tapes for thirteen years
So let's get, that, clear
You might have sold a few more tapes, but
Realistically, are you that great? (nah)
Can't get respect but I done paid dues
Stood on the block slangin cooked up rocks, I'm the same dude
I've been the same nigga since I came through

Wake up!

Do you know, where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?

Ayo what's going on y'all (nothing) wassup?
It's a few things you should know so let's touch up (okay)
I was once one of y'all, I admit
But I never judge a book by it's cover, my own was ripped
Look, most of y'all was a first class member
And now you're gone and it's past November
Word to Wyclef, I test the best
To go against the industry, without plan B
And don't count those that made it
Even those one hundred million bucks still don't equal up
Yo, where you live, you got a crib?
I bet you got some brand Timbs, car got brand new rims
Look, it happened to Prince, it happened to Michael
It happened to Bobby, it happened to Whitney, is y'all wit me?
Yo, things go wrong when there's no hit song
This chorus made for you, so y'all sing along, come on
 x2

Second, ayo I done checked the Vibe on any Rap Sheet
It's the same beefs, even athletes (uh-huh)
There's five types of ballplayers
Volley, foot, soccer, basket, base - all in the same race (to win)
What happen when the clock stop (uh?)
Injury, and no more wicked jump shots (two!)
ESPN ends...
There goes your 2 million fans and there goes your friends (uh-huh)
They don't care who you are and what you did
You a ""Where Are They Now?"" VH-1 type kid (it's over)
Major fact is, all the actors mad
Cause they Rolls been taking by rappers
""How High?""  You thought you had it all figured out
Get the car, get the truck, and then get the house (uh-huh)
Touchy subject, I ain't wanna paint this picture
But Picasso's dead, so I did it instead, do you know
 x2

Listen, uh-huh
This is for the nine to five worker, or nine to five hustler
That had to make ends meet, in the kitchen or the street
I wish drugs was food and water was liquor
So you'd kick back, kill thirst and not kill niggas
Every real gangsters dies
Tony, Al Capone, Gotti, Bonnie & Clyde
It's almost done for you, it's about to end
Either linin six by two, or live in a 8 by 10 of sin

They figure I'm a trigga happy nigga so they step back

Lord forgive me now

I can't sing so I have to bounce
Even though, that's not what my style's about
I hate this world, sometimes it gets me
When family and friends are not friendly
I just don't get it - so I sit home
In the bassment lights low on the mic and spit it
They plot, to get my scratch
Not knowin the time to get where I'm at now
In my face, like I owe 'em somethin
Handout from me, and never did nuttin (word up)
They're mad at me, like I changed
It's hard on me Lord, it's wreckin my brain
Is it me?  I know it can't be
So I ask you, please help me, now

Sometimes I laugh, tryin to keep from cryin
If I was plain out of luck, then tell me who could I trust
See I work so hard, just to get ahead
If it wasn't for God, I'd probably be dead

Uhh, I laugh when ain't nuttin funny
Meanwhile cats wanna count my money
Plan on me, to get jumped or somethin
Plot-ting like E's punk or somethin
Feels so strange, how I maintain
To last in the game, throughout my fame
I'm focused man, the E stay the same
Hate when folks call me out my name
Damn Lord, heal my body
Cause I'm mad enough to kill somebody
Even hard to trust my lady
Did she lock me down to have my baby?
I know she love me - damn it's nuttin
The world's so corrupt, it got me buggin
Uhh, I wanna move away like Nas in Belly
Y'all feel me - yo, R. Kelly


Huh, yo, huh
The game changed, damn I should quit
Can't get respect, without havin a hit
Someone somewhere talkin shit
Got fake cats in my clique
But I deal with the cards that's dealt
Try to make music that's heartfelt
Still doin eighty on the Belt'
In the Escalade, with Dolce shades
I've been paid, now what's left?
I guess, should I stress life or death (huh?)
Sometimes I wanna end it all
Live at peace, with 'Pac and Smalls
Can't do that, got fam at the crib

Step off me, I'm hyped like I had a pound of coffee

Took the sucker out, cause he clowned me on a payday
The funk is flowin to the maximum
From the E Double, while I kick the facts to them
Check a chill brother with class, rough enough
To run up and snatch the spine out a niggas ass
Grip the steel when caps peeled, here to chill on the real
And don't give a motherfuck how you feel
Thinkin you're steppin to this, I kinda doubt it
Ain't with the bullshit, so you can write a fuckin book about it
The big nigga with the bud and I'm on that
E kick the beat and yo you shoulda known that

Droppin that mellow but mad mackadocious

I'm determined to be the nicest creation since devices
Or Italian ices, no matter what the problem is, I still, ah 1-2, in your
Face like I'm Biz
Hook:
Boy meets world ""I want to know of you, I want to know of you.""
I wanna know if you feel me though (X8)
Verse 2:
I believe in the power of the conscience mind
And if you think something then it becomes something like
If I had to battle a whole crew, if I couldn't beat them
Then my conscience would defeat them, yeah
I wouldn't put my career in jeopardy, but I will let something off if these
People keep stressing me
This is madness, I wish I was around when that midnight train to Georgia
Picked up Gladis
Listen close life is just what you make of it, if you wanna Be Happy like
Mary J
Then hey,  then get rid of negativity in your circumference
Or outside your realm in mass abundance
Knowing that the industry is fulling up with drama got some hype (fakness
From people of all types)
Even the so-called keepin' it real type stars are frauds, get the sword
Outro:
And the question is asked. Who is the fake nigga? Who is the fake brother
That is always fuckin' up your shit. You wanna know how a niggas fake?
Check it out. Sit back and you focus your shit from a general perspective
And if your shit ain't lookin' tight, there's a fake nigga in your
Circumference. And that's word is born. For the 9-5 area, cause Def Squad
Forever, reigning much terror",https://genius.com/Erick-sermon-boy-meets-world-lyrics

A southern girl who raised me, look at me
A track record too long to fit in this song
Strong ass women, tougher than leather
Tougher than the pair of denim, ass barely fit in them

Gettin stupid -- shootin rhymes like arrows shot by Cupid
Ahh, you so crazy, is what somebody told me
You can't hold me, so why you actin bold G?
Come correct when you steppin dude, don't get rude
Or I might blast you durin my interlude
But for real though, I'm doper than chronic
A million dollar man, but I'm not bionic
Erick Sermon, a name you know so don't front kid
E.D., rock the mic and roll the blunt, ya dig?
Goal is to get Naughty by Nature
And blow up like when girls blow up my SkyPager
Make loot by the stacks - so when I come back
Through my neighborhood, they see I'm doin good
I got my hat to the back, my hands down below
So act like you know

Imma gitz mine, you go and get yours 
Imma gitz mine, you got it!

Part two, show the way I flip the funk lyric
And get ghost - with the magical form of spirit
I do my thing, I don't dare front or flake
I commence to earthquake, dominate, and cremate
Abuse and use a funky form of dialect
When I mic check, I freak the ill concept like
Skip to my loo my darling, I hear someone calling
Hey, Erick Sermon, yes yes y'alling
I got funk by the ounce to make you bounce
To the bus stop, and flash back to the wop
Now I got the +Vibeology+, in a funky way
Somethin Paula Abdul would say
My style Development, should be Arrested
Arrested Development, _Everyday People_
From my heritage kickin, E's on a mission
It's a black thing kid, and not the Blonde Ambition
Mackaframa, fly mack-dose
Got props from North South, East and the West coast
Like Michael Jackson boy, just _Leave Me Alone_
Cause once again it's on


(Worrrd) One two, as I speak upon the funk
Why is that when the ?, the people told the junk
Man, we can't have anything
Why can't we all just get along like my man Rodney King
I'm a young man, doin what I have to
Who asked you? I'm doin what I gotta do
I'm guaranteed to have my own show, like Arsenio
If I maintain to be a desperado
Stayin wicked when I kick it through your speaker
You might think I'm a alien, but that's a corny ?
Because my ways are, ""Strange -- and I like it""
And got power like a psychic

It's on (IT'S ON, IT'S ON, IT'S ON, IT'S ON!!)

The industry is a trick, and everyone is on the dick
A cheap trick, just like ? like ?
I peep it, everyone, wants me to sound like
A ?, I'm dyin, before I get up from behind
It's crushin up the rush of the rhyme in my mind
Drink and trust - blind, think and trust - my, nine
Because, nine lives nine triggers
Fine rhymes equal the nine figures
Yeah the cold cash, I hold a bold stash
Yeah pockets next to my nineteen year old ass
Yeah, God bless the child with his own
God bless the roots and outsiders who zone
Motherfuckers caps, get bucked in the dome
Lick a shot, in his mad packed crazy chrome
Chorus (+ Soup shouting over)

Like that, but it's all words
Words can kill more pens, than guns, and friends
And foes, God knows, I chose the pros
That rose, still froze-n, chose-n, YOU

It's the dude

The doorbell rings, it's my man, Ooh Wop, hyped
About something that happened last night (yo what's up?)
Yo, I'm the mix at the tunnel at the bar
Playing big bully with the other superstars
I might stout, ray bans, I got them going, dummies
I got the Moe laid back, low key
Now next to me, yo, I hear a bitch speaking
I hear her say your name, so I start tweaking
I'm eavesdropping, plus I got my head bopping
I'm on point, cause I be getting in with the joint
I hear this nigga talking, ""I know that big black motherfucker
He know me too, he's a sucker, bitch""
I glanced over to see his grill (oh no)
I recognized him plus his ho
I chilled, checked my watch, it's 3:15, the club is almost over
Without the keys to the Range Rover
Tapped my man upon his shoulder
I said ""yo, we splittin"", he saw I wan't bullshitting

In the heat of the moment
Things get hot


Club's letting out soon, I see them coming
Him and his girl dolo, I move up slow
They walk towards a black Yucon, alarm hits on
Before he gets in, I'm up by his chin
I asked him a question, ""you know my man E?""
""Hell, who the fuck are you?"", I smacked him with the 32
Just because he raised his tone, to impress the girl
I rocked his fucking world
As I'm looking, I remember you had beef a long time ago
In Georgia, at the club Soho
I left a message, ""next time I'm pistol whipping you
And stripping you, to the ground butt naked""
Hit the deck and feel the blast of the oowop invasion
Coming from the scorching hot desert
I'm blazing, grazing, so amazing, flaming
Clowns get vamped from the Hell I'm raising
Torment and torture, the enforcer
I'll extort you, claim that ass, your mine, I just bought you
Cha-Ching! That will be $12.50, thank you...

S.O.D.,React,2002,"Yo, I'm a tic-tac-toe tactical wit it tactician
Tit for tat, three bombs on me, we all ticking
Schizophrenic, up in the kitchen
With a black fifth up against my head, just, click, click, clickin' it
Recheck the barrel and start respinnin' it
We I start, medics, start sowing and restitching them
My constituents and scorpions poisonous stingers filled with opium
Stay grippin' 'em
I got a venomous heart, filled with vigilance
That will shatter seven continents and ten peninsulas
Envision the vengefulness, visualize the vindictiveness
I rhyme with Sid Vicious viciousness
You be kiddin?
You soft like kittens
My grills are pit bulls they will kill when I say sick'em
Restrain me, restrict me
I'm arresting, resisting
I'm a rest when resisting, can't be apprehended
Nigga

If you got a problem with E
And you got a problem, come and holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole Squad siding with me

Let the gatty spray and wet up the matinee
Smack niggas with both hands like patty-cake
Violate and I will retaliate
I don't battle fake niggas, I'm heavyweight nigga
GMG, fam, we gladly hotta
Ic' hold the sorcerer's stone like Harry Potter
And I'm like harry potta, we scary riders
Can't get near the dadda
I swear to God I'll come find where you hidin'
Have my high ninas, firing ninas from Beamers
And leave the area shot up, you hearing me patna?
I'm a fucking five star general, to drive cars into you
Ic' dodge interviews
One flip of the mac, take all ten of you
This message intended to, who's ever offended duke
Yeah you my nigga, but you could still get it too
So don't test me, I don't wanna do this shit to you


Live from the NY state
And I gots one question, guess what's in my waist?
Ya'll got me pisted off slick talk
To get that Jacob watch, I'll cut your wrist off
I'm in the limo too long to turn
And this motherfuckin' dutch taking long to burn
I'm impatient
This is a song you learn
Make money, take money, and I'm hear to confirm my occupation
The new boss of course, the new Porsche
I pull up just to murder you niggas and move off
You too soft, Red Cafe from New York
I tell a bitch quick, I'm hot can't cool off
I twist lesbos, and and guzzling out X.O
My firearms stick to my waste like Velcro
It's R.C. nothing phony about me
With E double the O.G. you know me


Yeah I know, you never expect me to anchor
I bring it to them so called pranksters and them gangsters
I run DMCs, from rappers that's petter piper
I am the big apple, ain't nobody riper man
I'm not M.J. I'm a lover and a fighter
That's why I'm in D.C. now, looking for the sniper
I came in the game with hoodies and timberlands
Hard since Cypress Hill been wanting to kill a man
I did time, a thirteen year bid
I'm gutter E, I'm hanging on the side of crib
I'm a fan, but I hate what you're doing
Whenever you performing shows it's me booing
Ya as soft as your bid-die
You punk now, and you gonna be a punk at sixty
Dawg, ya need more team to get me
I'm a G, and my Unit come through like Fifty

Same word, rework 'em without re-wordin 'em
Word perfect for workin with 'em
Workmen do homework, men at work in the network workin system
Yeah, I overwork, work the middle
Work and turn your homework workbook against you
In the range of a roundabout ratio
I merry-go-round around around the radio
Around around and away we go
Everytime Sy bust down then it's up up away you go

Now what do you niggas think about this
A jam for the streets that you can't resist
So hustle to this, bang to this
Get your money to this, yeah listen to this
Now what do you bitches think about this

You see the new E-Dub spin when I pull up
Ecko sweatsuit with the hood up
This shit is so hot you could cook an egg on it
So I sunny-side up, buttered toast my opponents
I take the drama to the middle of the street
Or any nigga that's feelin himself like Tweet
Kid you sonned out, let me speak to your father
Matter of fact, hold these here, and don't even bother

Just me in the lab, just me in the street

Half the industry rhymes on somethin I did
I target, one market
Underground shit to start arguments about who's dope

They fiend for this, like he's a genius

Then buy that tape, and hear that flow (YO!)
Jah said somethin like you have to grow
Can't stagnate the flow, cause you said so
I walk this way, cause I've paid dues
I'm a giant, and you need platform shoes
Talk to me


Okay last bomb, so I'mma let this go
Been fresh since Doug and Ricky did ""The Show"" (YO!)
And you act like E's not able
You ain't said nuttin, put the cash on the table
I'm from the era of battle, LL, Moe Dee
Who held the mic when you held the rattle
But you frontin like E's not happenin
Like Run told me, ""I'm the reason why you rappin""
Feel my spirit, so powerful that the dead can hear it
I'm Raw, got the wrath of Kane

Yo I contour my lines, to freak a funky rhyme
To fit you like a pair of Calvin Kleins
Mad brother with distinction, keep the girls blinkin

When I rock the mic and get freaky and nasty
People in the industry seldom ask me
Whassup, whassup, whassup

And the club's packed and shit, I feel like freakin
Pick up the phone, call my niggas, ""Yo whattup dude?
Need me a bitch man, to put me in the fuckin mood
Check this here - I'll pick you up around twelve o'clock
Right around the parking lot, I'll find a spot
It's on, man I'll see you soon
In about twelve hours, yeah past noon""
It's the hype yo
It's the hype
Word, pulled up brake, ehh, by the front door
Parlay, and I stepped out hardcore
I tipped the boy park the car in the front
Not the back, in case I have to run and get my strap
I walked inside, somebody sing, ""Errrick Serrrmon""
That's me, got me in free
Looked around the club, man no half-steppin
Walked straight up, to the V.I.P. section
Sat by the wall, so I can see what's happenin
My boys spread out, got their girls, and rappin
Oh no, I see a girl comin towards me
Posse deep, so I paused for the cause G
She approached me, hi, told me her name
I told her my name, then kicked the game
Sat beside me, like Little Miss Tuffet
 (hello)
Talkin bullshit, knowin I want to fuck it
Basically, I figured she was widdit
So I pulled out my ink pen and exchanged the phone digits
Gimme a call when you get to your crib
So I can get directions, right to where you live
She smiled, and left, the girl was wide open
I'm no jokin, when the E blows the smoke in
Check the Rolex, asked for my check
The waitress came over in a pair of black spandex (whoo!)
Gave me a look like, ""Aren't you Erick Sermon?""
""Yes, and who is it concernin?""  Me, that's the hype
It's the hype
I asked her, ""What time you get off?""  ""Oh, in 15 minutes""
So I stormed the bitch like a blizzard
""Umm, can I take you home?""  ""Sure meet me in the parking lot
I'll flash my high beams, so you can find my spot""
She came out - MAN, she was all that
Cool like that, and stacked like that
She jumped in with a wide open grin
Before I went to her crib, I dropped off my best friend
Got to his house, and gave him dap
He knew what time it was, so he passed me a 
jim hat
Got to her house, then parked the Jeep
I asked her who was home she said her sister but she sleep
Walked upstairs, right into the room
With one skylight lookin straight at the moon (yep yep)
She wasted no time, man she was on it
Grabbed for the bozack, and her hands was packed
Took off our clothes, went to work, man trust me
I heard someone knockin, somebody tried to bust me
It was her sister, man I must be buggin (ahh shit!)
It's the same girl, I met from the night clubbers
""That's your sister?  Oh I didn't know -- I'll go""
And they both screamed, ""Hell no!""
They smiled, with a devilish grin
And the other sister jumped in

Yo! I'm in the zone tonight with no special guest and...
In the recession the E's progressin
Eye candy stay in my session
So when I write, I'm cool, with no regression
I'm focused now almost restin
'Cause, I do it in my sleep caressin
The beat's like it's a chick, from Straight Stuntin (SLAY!!!)
Give it to her hardcore like it's nothin!
Uh! I Roc like Charles Dutton (Uh Huh!)
And I call the shots, then I push the buttons
So when it comes to war, I nuke 'em
You know you done fucked up right! Bill Duke 'em
You can, do what I say or lay like carpet
The New York area I ran that market (Uh Huh!)
Flush the whole decade I ran like faucet
Or weight, like The Biggest Loser, you lost it

You can see me in the flyest thing that I think is
It's brown guess what my drink is?!
Chicks catchin Vapors but I ain't Biz
I'm the commander, chief with the answer

I advise y'all to be like we, if you wanna become a success like we
All up in your prime stay fresh like we
Watch what I'm doin I did this before

I pull up at the G spot (VROOM VROOM!!!) My sound boomin
And I'm West Coast upped!!!! That's what I'm doin
And I do it the most, won't stop won't quit
You know how us gangstas do it yeah BANG THAT SHIT!!!
Ha Ha! Get your walk on do that dance (J!!)
Get your boogie on get in a stance
Drink spillin, 808 hittin nobody shootin and killin
'Cause everybody 'round here be chillin
(Now what we gonna do?) Get your party on
All night long (From two until the break of dawn)
BOUNCE! Put your motherfuckin hands up
HOMEBOY! If your hatin shut the fuck up!
Low low ragtop, drive coupes and fly shit
Black tie party and I'm comin with a bad bitch
Weed blowin so the party ain't over
We do this shit all night 'til six in the mornin!!!

You can see me in the flyest thing that I think is
It's brown guess what my drink is?!

Future Thug (Original Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"WITHOUT further adieu let me get this show on the road
Future thug, even my Kool-Aid jug's plated in gold
Faded & blowed, my life savings - made it in shows
& lost it on my way to Jers' 'cause I paid it in tolls
So you can kiss my hairy bean bag, FUCK the nations
& twitch your favorite titty nipples to my radio station
'Cause I say what I mean & I do what I say
I had a mind of my own the weed blew it away!
& now my lyrics got the parents all disgusted & heated
Because I'm nastier than airplane food & those that eat it
I'm never forgotten, just rotten straight to the core
Up in your 'telli with that wet towel up under the door
So need I say more? I'm just your neighborhood whore
With Coronas & blunts the size of some 4x4s
So all these other phony rappers, keep your heads to the sky
Because I'm ruining it for evryone, they wish I'd just DIIIIE!

ATL (oh!), DC (oh!), Houston (oh!)

Tennessee (oh!)

Ay yo, everybody hands up
Where yo' bling bling nigga? Boy stand up
It's E-Dub what's up? Yeah I'm bouncin'
Large amounts of cash we countin', that stand tall like mountains
To bring the drama, it takes a second man (that's it)
One wrong move +Bring the Pain+ like +Method Man+
It's yo' boy damn it, it's the Bandit, new Hummer in transit
27"" come standard (yo!)
It's my people, whether drivin' the Benz, the Pinto, or the Regal
The Range Rover, the Beatle (uh)
I'm in New York now but I represent the SWATS of A-Town
When I touch down amid grounds (uh)
Me and L-Dub and Redman, that's it Motherfucker

Shaolin (oh!), Y.O. (oh!)

Yo, I ain't a thug but I do thug things nigga so hold me down
40-round, caliber spitter, that's how the shorty crown
Run with gordy hounds for 40 miles then ignore me now
Duck +Motowns+ than Barry Gordy found, sorry clown!
Super future thug, 12 shoe shoot you through the rug
James Bond, watch on my arm, tellin' me who to truck
My God's my gun, don't need him since cerebreal cock
Beat him size ammo three to five mammal we the Gods
That'll shit on your turf, that'll get in your skirt
I heard +Alicia+ so my dick give what +A Woman's Worth+
I make them niggas blow, then hide 'em inside 'em
My noggin' is strange when them dogs is ridin'
'Cause I'm a cheap fucker, street usher, eat supper with
Pack of wolves that act a fool, blood on they upper lip
Need a nigga, I'm that nigga to call, nigga to draw
Chainsaws to the brawl, cuttin' ya ligaments off

ATL (oh!), Chi-Town (oh!)
To all my niggas (oh!) that is bumpin' & dumpin' (oh!)

New York, stand up! (I don't care!)

Yeah, I'm on the block, man (chillin!)
I'm parked by the Rucker park, I'm just (chillin!)

The most anticipated chick of the year, cheaugh
I came to flip and reverse game
Every dude I touch get whipped lie my first name, and
Although I'm prissy, don't get it confused
I don't need to mess with you, I got plenty of dudes
Got the caramel skin, on the parallel twin
Heads keep turning like a carosel spins
I know for a fact, these women are sick
Cause these hoes can't mess with this Dominican chick
Got the flag on my arm, it proves I am the bomb
All I do is speak Spanish and it works like a charm
I been ready, cause I payed my dues
Yo, this goes out to my Brooklyn crew

Blood on the dance floor, sweat on the ceiling
When you get that feeling that gun concealing is a hobby
Nobody stealing shows like Kweli
Working on a new project while you chillin in the lobby
Keep it thorough, ain't real, guns don't kill
People kill people, but the Sun don't chill
But still, I stand cooler than a Minnesota winter
Nigga, hotter than the blocks where guns bust over dinners
Plus, all the sinners got dreams they running after
Working a 9 to 5 now is like you hustling backwards
That's why all these young girls in love with the rappers
Basketball players, and up-and-coming actors
Swimming with the sharks, and flirting with disaster
When the things you own start owning you, they your master
Yeah! (I don't care)

I got the yak in the back of the club, I'm just (chillin!)
With Whip and my nigga E Dub, we just (chillin!)
Nobody give a fuck about you, we (chillin!)

Here I Iz,React,2002,"Yo!  Here I is on radar
A sixteen verse burst, the last two are 8 bar
Cause by that time, I been did damage
The type 9/11, so duke call the reverand
Sermon; the rappin Mandingo
A mega producer, more drugs than Ringo
""A Star is Born,"" Erick Streisand, the E I'm nice man
A rock star while youse a mic stand
So everybody gather round by the speaker
To hear things clear, the blood comin out the ear
I'm a daywalker, the rap be the serum
My Squad still Def and you still can't hear 'em
If you was a shadow, you couldn't get near 'em
Even if there's ""Thirteen Ghosts,"" you couldn't fear 'em
Look outside, there's 24's on my Cadd' (huh?)
I'm a +Big Boi+, droppin ""Bombs Over Baghdad""

Here I is, Sermon - yeah - I'll mark an E on your back
Yeah.. ""That's my man throwin down!""

Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
It's like street hop, the beat knock
I'm what time it is on my clock on my block
I'm rockin, I got the Earth in a cradle
Youse a baby and not quite able (hell no)
""The Ring"" appears when you're facin me
Death comes time after, some say it's the rapture
I'm closed captioned, boy I'm Phil material
(Yeah Francis Ford Coppola, E-Dub's the opener)
See you at your burial, ""Wack MC"" on your gravestone
Atlanta, I get busy in the Braves home
I'm on your head, Ted Danson +Cheer'n+
You forgot Squad is Def, and we hard of hearin (WHAT?!)
The star vet got a StarTac phone
Extraterrestrial, to see who phone home
Got more dough than me?  Man stop it
Green shit, I got +Shrek+ in my front pocket!

Here I is, Sermon - yeah - I'll mark an E on your back

See I know how to get down, word up
It's so hot it's, LL's version of the East coast chronic
Smoke 'til your lungs collapse
You supposed to be the nigga, where all the drama at?
So ironic, L came back
Flooded the market - got your mens on the wall
Holdin his blunt, too fucked up to spark it
Show me a nigga who can do like I do
Then gas your mans up so I can rip that nigga too
Braggin you goin platinum like that shit brand new
I was platinum in eighty-five, what THE FUCK wrong with you, huh?
Come (?) L - what you call rocks to me is minerals
Tried to throw salt on my name, shit's political
The baddest man on the planet
So ill when I'm spittin niggas take it for granted
Cram to understand it, I'll switch and write it lefthanded
Heat my pinky ring up and leave your bitch branded
Got a voice like a cannon - nigga shoot
I don't think she really hot, your career is a fluke
I'm the best MC to ever touch the pen
Take a look at what I'm doin it will not be done again
As sure I am the descendant of former slaves
I'ma resurrect brothers from they mental graves
Make 'em confess - LL's the most rugged
God, and no man's above it, gotta love it

DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about
MI - you ain't goin - FA
L said it - SO, puffin on the - LA
DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about
MI - you ain't goin - FA
E said - SO, puffin on the - LA (.. TI DO)

Uhh, E Dub on the microphone
Droppin bombs - spots get blown
So why would you assume my style wouldn't bloom
When I rap, wack MC's vacate the room
Cause they suck, and that's how I feel
I'ma smack down the A&R who signed the deal
Then wrap 'round his neck yo' reel to reel
So next time he know, how the real feel
Get loose and wrap hand 'round the steel
Leave you in the truck, wrapped 'round ya wheel
(I ain't playin) But y'all front like I ain't it
And every rapper y'all like, sample my shit
(Name one) I'm nice, and there's no mistakin
I threw a bomb rhyme in the hands of Troy Aikman
My track record is out there, gone
E.T. like maybe I should phone home (hello?)
I'm known for the dome bangers
Drop any song of mine right now in the club and it's DANGER
Scarface, E, LL Cool (jigga jigga)
J, never heard it spit this way, hey

DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about
MI - you ain't goin - FA
L said it - SO, puffin on the - LA (that's right)
DO - get this bread, use ya infrared
RE - fuck the industry, it's all about
MI - you ain't goin - FA

You a trash-ass nigga, slash garbage-ass rhymer
You switched from the raw to a chart climber
And now your shit is blowin out the stores
And uh, next month you fin' to go out on the tour but
Count - (two, three, and, four)
Your records ain't sellin no more
And damn - you done spent your money galore
Buyin all the stupid shit that your money can't afford (uh-oh)
Tryin to keep up with the trendy
Got your bitch minked out in all Fendi
Bought your homeboy a brand new Bentley
And the well that wouldn't run dry is now empty
It's simply, cause you wasn't focused on the next day
And your next tape you can't give it away, but hey
I send these to these niggas tryin to keep up with the Joneses
Everything you see me I owns it
I've been quietly sellin tapes for thirteen years
So let's get, that, clear
You might have sold a few more tapes, but
Realistically, are you that great? (nah)
Can't get respect but I done paid dues
Stood on the block slangin cooked up rocks, I'm the same dude
I've been the same nigga since I came through

Niggas fix ya face fore I fucks it up permanently
Hit that, quit that, then burn it a B

On my worst day, see I hammer that ass
Line for line, let's see whose stamina lasts

Show the tapes to my dogs like we was all menace
Look how long I sit, still big as it get
People still runnin' up with that Digga-Digga shit

Known like crack or angel dust up on the corner
I'm dirty like pneumonia
Stylistic, Erick makes the world go round
I'm devious mischievous, and if y'all believe in this
Then cool, alrighty then
Let's begin with this masquerade without George Benson's rendition
Huh, don't forget boy I'm still hittin' switches
Hittin' Nubianses with rags or re-iches
Whatever's clever, I still be the Funklord
E Double, from EPMD from NYC
My style starts more fights than hockey
I Wayne Gretzky, on any MC
Double or nothing, raise your bets
If you got it empty your pockets
Shit take the gold off your watches
Huh, I'm confidence
I will Trailblaze you and your crew to Portland
First class wearin' Walkmans
Now, who let the bones out the closet
The fans cut you off like if they were Lorena Bobbitt's boy
That's trifling, and was it deserved maybe
That's more evil than Rosemary's baby
Anybody outcast the E I'm doin him
Try my best to ruin dem and outright screwin' 'em
From Boyz II Men, turn men to boys
From child to kids for whatever dey did
You dig? You crossed the wrong bridge and it's over
It's rigged, with all types of deadly explosives
Watch out, I'm serious like Jermaine Jackson
I call red when it's time for some action
I'm coming through with the ultimate
Ultra-style-Magnetic, funkdafied shit from me Erick
Who said the E can't rock? That's bullshit
Suck my dick and get a big fat lick of my balls
You wanna brawl? Punk I thought not
You might get beat down, stomped like Sasquatch
Your girl, like Keith Sweat, I wanna
Fuck her, psych I already stuck her
Huh, I got rhymes to make your whole head swell up
Here's an icepack homeboy shut the hell up
Huh, Erick Sermon comes through
I can't be stopped, I'm like a runaway train
No half-steppin' like if I was Kane
I come through the crowd Rugged-Sluggish, to the Bone
I grab the microphone niggas know me, whassup homey
Who wanna go through me

Tit for tat, three bombs on me, we all ticking
Schizophrenic, up in the kitchen
With a black fifth up against my head, just, click, click, clickin' it
We check the barrel and start respinnin' it
We, I start, medics start sowing and restitching them
My constituents and scorpions poisonous stingers filled with opium
Stay grippin' 'em, I've got a venomous heart, filled with vigilance
That will shatter ten continents and ten palatinates
Envision the vengefulness, visualize the vindictiveness

I'm arresting resistance, can't be apprehended nigga
You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started

Smack niggas with both hands like patty-cake
Violate and I will retaliate
I don't battle fake niggas, I'm heavyweight nigga

Behold the sorcerer's stone like Harry Potter
And I'm like Harry Potta, we scary riders

Y'all got me pisted off slick talk
To get that Jacob watch, I'll cut your wrist off

And this motherfuckin' Dutch taking long to burn
I'm impatient, this is a song you learn
Make money, take money
And I'm here to confirm my occupation
The new boss of course, the new Porsche
I pull up just to murder you niggas and move off
You too soft, Red Cafe from New York
I tell a bitch quick, I'm hot can't cool off
I twist lesbos, and guzzling out exos
My firearms stick to my waste like Velcro
It's R.C. nothing phony about me
With E double the O.G. you know me
You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started
Plus I got the whole squad siding with me
Yeah, I know, you never expect me to anchor
I bring it to them so called pranksters and them gangsters
I run DMC's from rappers that's petter piper
I am the big apple, ain't nobody ripper, man
I'm not M.J., I'm a lover and a fighter
That's why I'm in D.C. now, looking for the sniper
I came in the game with hoodies and timberlands
Hard since Cypress Hill been wanting to kill a man
I did time, a thirteen year bid
I'm gutter E, I'm hanging on the side of crib
I'm a fan, but I hate what you're doing
Whenever you performing shows it's me booing
Ya as soft as your bid-die, you punk now
And you gonna be a punk at sixty
Dog, ya need more team to get me
I'm a G, and my Unit come through like Fifty
You got a problem with E
If you got a problem, come a holla at me
And if you want it, we can get it started

Not to mention spittin scraps, don't mix your puddy-tat with that
{*meowww*} Dhark Citi, put it on your map
Don't ride through without your pistol, put it on your lap
And I don't look for beef but don't think that I won't attack

You shoulda thought of that before the fact

Street Hop (Featuring Redman & Tre),UnKnown,UnKnown,"This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
Yeah, Redman uh, E. Sermon, Tre
Yeah, yo, I'm Doc, Brick City, know how I rock
I'm hip hop, I live up in the rim shop
I blow out my tires then I buy some mo'
My car's Ying Yang'n the way it sit low
A little Anita, a little Vandross
I got two guns to give you secondhand smoke
I'm no joke, this ain't Hanna Barbera
It's the Bricks, Mandela on Anteras
In my rear mirror, a freak approach
Knew she wasn't first class 'cause her bag was Coach
She was like, ""Redman! Buy me boots""
So I, bought her Timbs, and a army suit
Nobody want it with Doc, you smell me Duke?
Front page, smokin' L's in The Daily News
Y'all cats big time, but the tops are turned
When you in the same realm as, Doc and Serm', yeah
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
And hear the record it's hot say, one two, one two, one two
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
And hear the record it's hot say, one two, one two, one two
E-Dub in the flesh, no replacement
I still bring trunk funk from the basement
Peeimp MC, my style's mackadocious
Boy, ask her-on who the dopest
E steppin' to me, better-a think twice
I'm nice, the outcome be 'The Passion of Christ'
You get ripped, you ain't equipped to rock with the vandal
I change your Timberlands to sandals
Thug MC's, thinkin' they hard
When they walk around the block with six bodyguards
Yo, I'm a big dawg, you a pup
It's like comparin' a car to a truck
What, you spend dough for airplay when you network
That ain't fair, that ain't the way the street work
This is street hop, nuttin' about pride
For you, I'ma keep them ambulances outside, you dig?
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
You hear the record it's hot say, one two, one two, one two
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
You hear the record it's hot say, one two, one two, one two
All them rappers that can't rhyme
What is you doin' is a crime
Sayin' that garbage all the time
Word up, yeah
That's how I'm livin', still a gangsta, still a pimpin' mack
All around hustler, 9 to 5 flippin' crack
Tryin' to stay up out of prison, steady spittin' raps
Not to mention spittin' scraps, don't mix your puddy-tat with that
Dhark Citi, put it on your map
Don't ride through without your pistol, put it on your lap
And I don't look for beef but don't think that I won't attack
Have you in a coffin momma like, ""He don't belong in that""
You shoulda thought of that before the fact
Why a roll the dice, lose all they money, then they want it back?
But that's a bunch of crap
But f'real jyo, don't gamble witcha life, 'cause ain't no comin' back
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
You hear the record it's hot say, one two, one two, one two
This ain't rappin', this is street hop
Now get up off yo' like yo' seats hot
You hear the record it's hot say, one two, one two, one two
This ain't rappin', this is street hop

Big ass kid with a big ass crib (still hood)

My rap style got shiny rims and it's kitted

Around my neck a fat cable (uh-huh)

Got cameras all over me like R.Kel's spot
Look at me!
I'm a mixture of Godzilla and Kong
The Don Juan on your block, yo
I'm getting guap, yo
E-Dub I'm nothin but the truth
Transform to Superman when I'm in the booth
The cats think I'm old like ""E. can't ride!""
I resurrect like Jesus Christ when he died
I walk out the grave with 4 holes: hands and feet
Then find my squad and hit the streets
Yo! I'm the biggest thing since MySpace
I ain't lettin' no one come in and take my place!

Third verse - when I was released from the slammer
I was the first cat to ever move to Atlanta
Before it got hot I had a rim shot
And then came Two-Short, Scarface and Pac
Half the ATL that's on TV
Either hung around the kid or either worked for me
Cause I'm (Cool!) E-Dub I'm icon status
The first big boy Benz with 20 inch Brabus
I've been there, done that
I hung where you hung at
I ran where you run at
I came where you come at
If you don't know the definition of cool
It's ME! That nigga from E.P.M.D
I'm...

Banger..
Yo.. ""keep bouncing"".. have some fun
 Uh, bouncy bouncy

Uhh, flamin hot, game shot
Five seconds left, all net, watch
Yo, this here be a funky dope maneuver
Bring it to your gut with more Jab than Judah
(take that, take that) And make sure the beat slam to the canvas
Get a call from Vince McMahon cause I
Pinned the game with a Marvin verse
Two suburbs in the hearse when the rhyme disperse
Uh, E Dub been real since a fetus
Came out with no laces, shell toe Adidas
Fame like Regis - made myself a millionaire
Got three lifelines, I'm fine, I'm
OutKast +Fresh+, my tracks be +Clean+
No confusion, stop the illusion, E's
That man there do it, I come with explosive force
Sixth time on the cover of The Source
A decade, so what can y'all tell me?
Go against the grain is seldom seen
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turnin
I hear voices sayin, ""That's Erick Sermon""

He be the gen-i-us, E Dub
He be the one that rocks the house, so crazy (so crazy baby)
All my people out there show love (show love) ""keep bouncing""
Bounce, forrrrrrrrrr me ""keep bouncing""

 Whatcha gon' do when you get in the jam?
 I'm gon' have some fun
 What do you consider fun?
 Doin it for 'Pac, Big L, Tah and Pun

Yo, it's too hot for the devil
I raise the heat to the maximum level
Stop drop and roll, the roof's on fire
Next time think when my name's on the flier
T-shirt and jeans, Air's the attire
Two-way pager, NexTel wire
I'm like this seven days a week
Whatever, song is made best believe it's freak
Cause I - get my freak on, uh, I get my freak on
Erick Sermon is so ill, somethin to speak on
Yo, you came in the game and blew it
Got your rap deal revoked and can't renew it, uh
You wish you was blessed like me
A child God chose to overexpose, whoa
I'm over - that's what I heard
But now I'm on your station with songs preferred
Uh, I'm top three, in thirty-five states
And now I'm eating over thirty-five plates
When I walk through the crowd I can see heads turnin
I hear voices sayin, ""That's Erick Sermon""

Yeah, yeah, when I stick it she be like (uh)
Yeah, pimpin, I run up right inside 'em, yeah

Yo, it goes hey you, guess what, guess who gets what
I snatch baguettes, you get what you get, guess what
Guess what, you get it and forget it like guess what
Guess what get done to special guests that can't guess what
He goin on when Sy be goin off
In the cross my Squad run tracks like motocross
I write words I read and then re-word 'em
Same word, rework 'em without re-wordin 'em
Word perfect for workin with 'em
Workmen do homework, men at work in the network workin system
Yeah, I overwork, work the middle
Work and turn your homework workbook against you
In the range of a roundabout ratio
I merry-go-round around around the radio
Around around and away we go
Everytime Sy bust down then it's up up away you go

Now what do you niggas think about this
A jam for the streets that you can't resist
So hustle to this, bang to this
Get your money to this, yeah listen to this
Now what do you bitches think about this
A jam for the clubs that you can't resist
So shake to this, freak to this
Drink up to this, yeah listen to this

Uhh, huh
E-Dub, I'm known like the Rucker
Fucker, comin through like a redneck trucker
Nother, man down, call 9-1-1
I stash that so they can't find my gun
I'm in the woods like hikers, bikers, campers
Antlers, bears snakes and long-leg tarantulas
Uh, E-Dub I got balls
If I get chased pon' de river like Sean Paul, believe it
I'm on the fish neck, like jet-skis
I killed Romeo, along with Jet Li
And messin with the E be incomparable
Get romped like Romper Room, a one man platoon
Oh I say, I'm Andrew Dice Clay
Filthy mouth and also fuck y'all
You wanna get physical we touch y'all
Haters we appreciate the love so - thank you very much y'all


Last but not least, Keith wreck shop comfortably
When I flow, I fuck up your street credibility
Def Squad get busy often
When it comes to chicks we got more tricks than a dolphin
You see the new E-Dub spin when I pull up
Ecko sweatsuit with the hood up
This shit is so hot you could cook an egg on it
So I sunny-side up, buttered toast my opponents
I take the drama to the middle of the street
Or any nigga that's feelin himself like Tweet
Kid you sonned out, let me speak to your father
Matter of fact, hold these here, and don't even bother
We come through with the nines poppin
Niggas get so quiet, you can hear rats pissin on cotton
So you see there's nothin furthermore to say

Invade earth like a UFO landed

You still can't hang with the Green Eyed Bandit
Your chains tampered, caught red-handed
They asked you to run ya jewels and you ran it
Smile you on candid, fake thugs canned it
Got shot and +Scream+ed, like Michael and Janet
Tape SoundScanned it, b-boys slammed it
Gots to play my tune cause radio demand it
This here's the real, hardcore steel
Boogie Down Production, KRS-One feel
That there's the deal, Ron grab the steel
Set b-boy stance and grab my deallz

In stores boy I'm heartless give you the whole cartridge

Chop your hand off and sawed off your diamond ring
An' my nigga Murray touch down on it, time to push it
