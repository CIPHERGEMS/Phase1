7 Minute Freestyle,Harlem’s Finest - A Freestyle History,2010,"Yo, I got slugs for snitches, no love for bitches
Puttin' thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet, known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow? Hell no!
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough;
I'm known for yokin' Jacks
And beatin' them with smokin' gats
Leavin' token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit, step to the rear, son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
'Cause in a street brawl I strike men like 
lightnin
'
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes, I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug-related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks
Sellin' pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
I'm tellin' you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hottie stare
I keep a shotty near
It's that nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most, I'm leavin' niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smokin' dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed, and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids, I kept mad blades
Stabbin' teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak, 'cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper; fuck around
You'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a wild town
You know my style, clown, so bow down!
[Interlude: Big L + 
Jay-Z
]
Word up (say what?)
'95 style (yeah)
I got my man Jay-Z here (Jay-Z!)
Check it out now…
Check it, check it, check it out now

Brothers can beg and borrow, still feel sorrow
When Jay Z, like Zorro, get in that ass, better luck tomorrow
I'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down or get yo' ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky, to stop me you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone, you can still feel me, on the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven, I raise hell
'Til it's Heaven;
 
recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me, nigga, it's bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin' Crystal,
 
shootin' game like missiles
As projected, all hoes affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldie
But the goody, pullin' R&B bitches, wearin' hoodies
They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin'
When I be goin' I be runnin' the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things with a swing
And have 'em rockin' like…
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm, I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge
And follow with wisdom
For greater understandin',
 
I'm landin' blows
And knockin' sense into those that oppose me
Enticin' when slicin' through tracks
You're screamin': ""Jesus Christ, he's back!""
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map, so give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that—fuck that!
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible, even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beatin' me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow; I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creepin' through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Bet your lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's tryin' to be the best
And even in dyin' couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin'
Ever since L said, ""Throw three G's in!""
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself, I get up…
[Interlude: Jay-Z + 
Big L
]
Yeah, word life (Big L, try that mic out!)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (back to Big L)
(Let's get it, back to Big L!)
Yo, one two, one two, aight?
I'll drop one more joint, aight, check it out
I ain't do this in a while, check it out
One two, one two, check it out
One two, check it

Ayo, my crew be deliverin' hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch; nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' them shits in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
I'm feelin' like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probly got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head, got loot 'cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'ma beat your faggot-ass half-dead
I stomp white cops 'til they life stops, for a low price, hops
'Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
'Cause my crew'll kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my MAC-11 bucks
I'm killin' at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple, hun
Fuck love! All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown MC's I be attackin' quick
I'm on some rappin' shit and some car-jackin' shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac'
And put the gat to his cap, click-clack
Sorry, Jack, but get up out of that!
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin'; he started reachin'
So I left him sleepin' with his temple leakin'
[Interlude: Big L + 
Jay-Z
]
Aight, back to my man Jay-Z
One time
Check it out, uh

As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it
I get it together like a marriage
I'm seekin' all rappers, I'm on my P's and Q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand, well
Goddamn, don't you know my status?
I'm flowin' the fattest
Mmm that is, mmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain, my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinkin' that's hollow
The rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
It hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath… goddamn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, nah, whenever I'm in the
Uh, whatever I touch, whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya
Uh, the nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey
Hahahhhh, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in
Niggas are du-do-duckin', I'm bo-bo-buckin, fuck it
I'm wild, but a boo boo boo bam
What you niggas gonna do to the man?
I see you brought your little crew… and?
I'm still comin' with velocity
Check it out, Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of these clowns fuckin' around
Ain't none of these clowns standin' their ground
With the crown prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
Jay-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be comin' out of their seats now
Shit, I got crazy skills, it's a pity the way I'm rippin'
Rugged rhythm through the city
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
I got rhythm, I hit 'em with rhythm, I
Hit 'em and split 'em, I did 'em, I get rid of them guys
J-A, baby, baby please, gimme G's
Baby, baby, with crazy ease, watch Jay-Z get crazy G's",https://genius.com/Big-l-7-minute-freestyle-lyrics
Put It On,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous,1994.0,"Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""BOOM BOOM!"" and yo' guns go ""pow pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on

So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
C'mon, put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, represent, put it on, C'MON!

Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
(You don't know?) you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella, put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, represent!
Put it on, c'mon, put it on!

Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke

I drink Moët, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella put it on and onnn!
Big L, you gotta put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L put it on ond on!
Word up, knahmsayin?
My man Big L, runnin' things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?
It's the Kid Capri, in full flair
And we gon' put it on a little somethin' like this
Big L, c'mon!

Lord Finesse (He be puttin' it on)
My man Buckwild (He be puttin' it on and on)
My man Fat Joe (He be puttin' it on)
Showbiz and A.G. (Yeah, they be puttin' it on and on)

’98 Freestyle,The Big Picture,2000.0,"Fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting, trigger temper I'm quick to body somethin'
You looking at me like I'm probably frontin'
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all cause niggas like you
Be praying on my downfall, hoping I flop
Hoping I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smokin' the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk, you ain't a leader what, nobody followed you
You was never shit, your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit
Do me a favor; please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel, fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come? You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something, 'fore I crack his jaw
You running with boys, I'm running with men
I'ma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like ""damn it this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idiots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas

Aight, let me kick some more shit, one more time
(Yeah-yeah… Spit, some more) - Bobbito
Aight, check it out, yeah, check it out
Yeah, check it out, yeah, check it out
Uhh, check it out, aight, check it out
Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit, you ain’t worth stickin'
I’ve got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'ma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that
Yo, I’m not in the mood son, so don’t push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight — gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch; right now you prolly wearing wires
It’s not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I’ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no there ain't no parts open
I’m not a sweet stud, I’m a street thug
That’s quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain’t a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I’ll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal Street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo, I’m a take you out your misery
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book cause you’re history",https://genius.com/Big-l-98-freestyle-lyrics
Ebonics,The Big Picture,1998.0,"Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down

Check it, my weed smoke is my lye, a key of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted I'm high, with new clothes on, I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones, ugh
A radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cops
And if you got robbed, you got stuck, if you got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is an okey-doke
And if you got punched, that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speaking it

(Speak with criminal slang) That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang) That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

Yo, yo, a burglary is a jook, a wolf's a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony, you caught a F, if you got killed, you got left
But if you got the dragon, you got bad breath
If you 730, that mean you crazy
""Hit me on the hip"" means page me
Angel dust is sherm, if you got AIDS, you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease, then you got burned
Max mean to relax, guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats, critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub, a victim's a mark
A sweatbox is a small club, your ticker's your heart
Your apartment is your pad, your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speaking it

(Speak with criminal slang) That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang) That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)

The iron horse is the train, and champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine, she's a dime, a suit is a vine
Jewelry is shine, if you in love, that mean you blind
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl, that mean you creeping
Smiling is cheesing, bleeding is leaking
Begging is bummin', if you nuttin', you cummin'
Taking orders is sonnin', an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly, a cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly, your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took an L, you took a loss, to show off mean floss
Uh, I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speaking it

(Speak with criminal slang) That's just the way that I talk, yo
(Vocabulary spills, I'm ill)
(Speak with criminal slang) That's just the way that I talk, yo

The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, and when tensed, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
'Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A TEC-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
'Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me 'cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure

I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan

Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
'Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
'Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one

So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep

And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never passed up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit

(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up
They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well, I ain't real, 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a MAC-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly
Little kids be wakin' up cryin'
Yellin', ""Mommy, Big L is comin' to get me!""

(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone

I keep a cutie with a soft booty
Hoes be runnin' up, ""Can I get your autograph, L?""
No, bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge, just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch – if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Ayo, crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread, pretzelhead
'Fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

That's how we do it!

Follow me, tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See, niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned: word is bond, you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave, picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it

Fuck with me and have
A hundred motherfuckers at yo' do' with fo'-fo's!

With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash armed robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin', diamonds shinin', autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out, huh
‘Cause I keep cream, I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics you hear all the freaks scream

Yeah, yeah, Big L, Harlem's finest, yeah
That nigga who hold it down for Uptown

On this underground real shit, nigga, it's the heat, nigga

L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah 'cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them, they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C

Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance, Jack, to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches

Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)

From killin' corrupt cops with motherfuckin' buck shots
So don't step to this, 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big, but they make coffins yo' size, too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga, we do walk-by's
No one can match me, tax me, or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps, G, just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin? That's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS, every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than Swiss cheese

(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)

I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone, chief
Or catch a buck shot to your dome piece
I must warn, I got it goin' on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like PM Dawn
I'm catchin' bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggas, but hoes too
So don't try to test me, 'cause I can't stand testers
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man, you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the get-go
Leavin' fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

And I'm known to milk freaks and hit 'em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'ma start rapin' bitches
I'm all about makin' papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole
So the next day, knocked on his door, and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin' on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style, I'm wild, comin' straight out of Harlem, pal

Devil’s Son,Return of the Devil’s Son,2010,"Ayo, Showbiz, man, I had this bugged out dream last night that I was the Devil's son, B
I was doin' some ill shit

""When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus""
""When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus""
""When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus""
""I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns""
""When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus""
""When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus""
""When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus""
""I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns""

L's a rebel on a higher level, go get the shovel
'Cause I'm the only son of the motherfuckin' Devil
It's a fact I'm livin' foul, black
Niggas should have known I was sick
From the shit I did a while back
'Cause bein' bad I couldn't stop
When I was in pre-school, I beat a kid to death with a wooden block
Faggot niggas I was back-slappin'
I realized that every time I got mad somethin' bad happened
A nigga hit me with a can of beer, then he ran in fear
Later they found him hangin' from a chandelier
Enemies I be buckin' quick
My moms know who I am
'Cause she know who she was fuckin' with
On my skull the 666, no tricks
When I catch fits, my mom picks up the crucifix
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
I'm rollin' with Satan, not Jesus Christ
Enemies, I got several done
Big L straight from hell, the motherfuckin' Devil's son

When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns

It's Big L and I'm all about takin' funds
I'm a stone villain, known for killin' and rapin' nuns
Ayo, I even kill handicapped and crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
There's no doubt I'm all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
This kid Joe owed me dough, I didn't take his life
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
One nigga cold tried to diss me, and that shit is risky
The nigga took a swung but he missed me
So I popped off, now the chump's knocked off
I spit in his mothafuckin' face and then bopped off
Once a hottie shot me with a shotty
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way I'm livin' is dead wrong
I'm a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Killin' is fun, I'm number one with a gun
Front and get done 'cause you can't run from the Devil's Son

When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns

The Big L is strictly gun-play
I run through church and pistol-whip the priest every Sunday
Once I put out the crazy order
I sent niggas to kill Tom, his mom, and his baby daughter
I'm livin' up to my extortion image
I be stalkin' Lennox
Catchin' more bodies than abortion clinics
A kid tried to take L out
Shot me in the chest with a TEC
I just laughed and spit the shell out
Next I took his gun, then he dropped to his knees with ease
I made him freeze, he begged me please not to squeeze
But I ain’t the type to fuss, I just snipe and bust
Click clack bang, another nigga bites the dust
Shorts, I'm takin' none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devil's Son

Word, Big L
The motherfuckin' Devil's Son is definitely in effect
Givin' a shout-out to all the murderers, thieves
Armed robbers, serial killers, psychos, lunatics
Crackheads, mental patients, mental retards
And a special special shout-out to all the niggas with AIDS
Peace!

Lifestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous,1995.0,"(Everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
Did you think anybody in this town is any different?
They don't give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as ""the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin"")

My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave. there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no muthafuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob, selling corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin' connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po' - I couldn't afford the 'o-r'
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene, took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, ""Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke? *gunshots*
Now you're dead broke""
The Big L was cold crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

Word
All of us from Harlem
139
That's living the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

Coming at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown, and everywhere
Check it

Yo, where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
Their life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks, and bust gats, and run the streets actin' violent
To them, it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?) 'cause they're street struck

You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

Before the rap contract, I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head, do your thing
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
And yo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers, or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up 'cause they street struck

You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time, I'm in the crib writing rhymes to some dope beats
Or either calling up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

Word up
Ayo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the casualties of the streets

And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin' this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go berserk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, 'cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, 
wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally
, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

Well, I'm flave, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, 'cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas gotten props to swallow nuts

For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff and when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise
Break bones, then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease, ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from Hell, I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood, I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm no maricón, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice and cold take a fag's life
My swellin' melon got niggas jealin'
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon

Yo, I'm bustin' chumps like a Glock 10
When I drops in, the top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill your show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail, dig
Yeah, and I'm nasty, too nasty to trash me, bash me
Aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that's sawed-off
But when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
You dissin', you'll come up missin' like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Fletch
'Cause they sections say they slaughter, son
Talk about nines and TECs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease 'cause once I release
My crew from the East, we leavin' at least 20 police deceased
It's the beast on attack, so make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black MACs
On Lenox Ave., ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin' but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein' heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme 'cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones
And sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice 'cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a MAC-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm 'bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, aiyo, 8 is enough

True, true and before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning

"No Endz, No Skinz",Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous,1995.0,"Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother's tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losing all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

Girls of the nineties ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours, but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes selling jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke, the girls stopped speaking
'Cause nowadays girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. gold digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss, but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz, I'ma break it down like this

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

It's like that y'all and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all
If you don't got ends, girls be fronting
If you don't got ends, they ain't giving up nothing
If you don't got ends, all the girls ignore you
If you don't got ends, they act like they never saw you
If you don't got ends",https://genius.com/Big-l-no-endz-no-skinz-lyrics
American Dream,Return of the Devil’s Son (Deluxe Edition),2010.0,"Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler, blowing out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion chillin', inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream, weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smokers, Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper, I've been a willy for a while nigga
'Gruff got hoes, the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes, drop top Rolls
East coast, West coast, fiends overdose
'
Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

This money be temptin' me, to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since 14, I sold morphine for more green
Kept dope in a Nautica coat under the drawsting
And watched out for cops, squad cars, and Beemers
And laundry ninas, flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach (yeah) coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For a while, yo; pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo
'
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo so I can ship it out whenever I say so

Yo! Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast, you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown, Downtown; you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splittin' this cream

Yo! I'mma run hysterically, till they bury me
Count numerically,hills of Beverly
More grands than cherokee; president like Eric B., and Rakim
Drug game, I'm top ten; locked in? Right now its not an option
And those who creep got the Mac in the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy raggin'
Last year, had me saggin', wasn't ready
When Heavy was back, tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club, poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune; goddamn, you wrong
Killa kid Cam-e-ron surviving in the Amazon

Yo! I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted
While bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm back to sea, sippin' daquiris
Coke factory, fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts, and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chub
All the ladies love me, they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep, with freaks with Lamborghini jeeps
Neighbors be sneaking peeks, how my semen leaks, between the sheets
Mess up my loot, I cut your collars, Juan
Cause these is modern times, and the only thing I see is dollar signs


Check it! To be seen clean in the mean Beam
Is every team's dream; Big L's a cream fiend
With more green than Springsteen
You know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie
I'm known to mack a hoochie
Do I got stacks of lucci (Absolutely!)
Harlem kids is known for felonies
And sellin' keys, pushin 300Z's
GS3's, and puffin' trees
These G's breeze while DTs
Be yellin, 'freeze!', 
we stash cheese
And keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo, I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain, said ""act a fool and get slain”
Nigga, yo' bitch chose me, you know the rules to the game

Ayo, I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', ""L's this,"" and, ""L's that""—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up

I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
It's all about me, yo it's a B. I. G. L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate, Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing, cause every hero got a theme song

The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L

""Sit back I'm about to begin"")

I drive up and down Harlem blocks, iced-out watch
Knots in my socks, cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if I'm drunk, but I'm sober
They wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo, you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year, I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names, try to hurt my pride
You're just mad cause I'm a young cat, pockets dumb fat
Talking 'bout, ""Where the gun at?"" I been there and done that
I'm through with that illegal life, I'm staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pistol, my whole clique's wild
I'm rich pal, no more sticks, I'm making hits now
I drink Cristal, I'm through breaking laws
I don't sell coke any more, I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down, them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up, them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap, I doubt that

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

Aiyo enough's enough, Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus, they want a nigga's soul, but they know
Big Joey Crack will never rat a cat that he know
For sure, death before dishonor, I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing
Pursuing my dream till there's enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real, I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witnesses that you claim to have
Saying that I'm taking half, extorting New York and not paying tax?
I'm laid back playing the role, laying the low
But it's the same old Joe so don't get KO'd
Hey yo, I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid, why don't they just let a nigga live?

Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick
Why do I end up in so much shit?
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up, even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

I Don’t Understand It,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous,1995.0,"There are too many MC's who are overrated
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer,
 cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight before I bruise ya
For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
Hey yo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin games
I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin platinum and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin down
Because it should be the other way around

I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted

MC's - what's goin on?
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged
You're not the same,
 your raps are plain
That explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Who's fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same
And only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin beads?


This is how it should be done
I'm not the one, and my raps is strong like rum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum (How come?) Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail
They're false like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps border wack, and you went on tour with that
Crap, don't understand it, cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin hard, and rhymes they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's

Niggas like,""L, when you comin' out?""
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wife's missin', I'm the nigga she was last seen wit'
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A buncha niggas got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds wit' dime hoes who stuff the coke in they ass
Crazy beef's got provoked in the past, lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth, believe me son
We breed the smoothest niggas on the face of the earth
Mics I steadily smoke, rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd I'ma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when I was unheard
Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word, you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say what's up, gimme a pound, that's it
When I was at the steak house, pullin' cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out, you took the fake route, you oughta break out
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out
What?! Yeah, fuckin' punks
Niggas like you will get robbed everyday

All my wolves in the house, are you live or what?
See, Harlem 'bout to get it, all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine, who gon' rise wit' us?
And the first cat who act, we gon' size 'em up
All my wolves in the house, are you live or what?
See, Harlem 'bout to get it, all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine, who gon' rise wit' us?
And the first cat who act, we gon' size 'em up

How Will I Make It?,Harlem’s Finest - A Freestyle History,2010.0,"Some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will

I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, ""How will I make it?""

It seems like my life's been cursed ever since I was a child
And how will I make it? I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown, I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how
Aiyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it, I won't, that's how

Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream
Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday and it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets late, robbing suckers for funds
Now everyday I creep with the heat, ain't nothing sweet
I rob for meat, If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living Hell
Then I started to realize, I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiyo, I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'How will I make it?'


Doing time was full of stress G
All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease, I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'How will I make it?'


Word up man, it's real rough out here man
In the ghetto, all you can wish for is a better tomorrow

Fed Up With the Bullshit,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous,1995.0,"Yo, on the scene is the brother that's big, I'm not a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they ain't nothin but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights, and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop, or I'mma stop em, by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me, muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin life bids
Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip, cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up (Aw, shit)

Whether it's the hot, warm, cool or the cold season
Pigs be fuckin with a nigga for no reason
You're just gettin home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up, and that's fucked up
This every day, not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other cheek
Or you'll be layin' in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm also fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin
Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick

I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out, uhh - bust it

Aiyyo I just left the studio, and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And there's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jump in the Jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep; my voice is hoarse, barely can speak
I called back on the cell - it's Corle', mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell

""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn""

""It's my wife, you sure?""

""Yeah, I'm sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door""

""Say no more, which one?""

""The one in Jersey son, right over the bridge""

""We goin' hurt those hoes""

""And hurt both of them kids""

Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cut
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
""Yo, who that in the background?""

""It's Tommy Gibbs""

""Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready? We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared, there's no time to back out

We gon' take the back route
And pull the gats out and throw the mask on
We ain't leavin til everyone's dead, and all the cash gone

We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do""

""So let's do it!""

I stepped to the desk clerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?"" She paused and said ""212""
I took the steps now I'm out of breath; I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the Glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced, I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin

These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate

We know they got stacks
Cause they don't fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose

And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
""You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at""

He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 ki's in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass, and two million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the T
I put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Corle' done popped them punks

""Aiyyo fuck it L, we might as well pop these cunts""

Now that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money three ways

At the bars buyin Cristals like they bud lights
My style is hard like strong lumber
Dime pieces get the digits, chicken heads get the wrong number


Yo I announce facts
When I get busy over bounce tracks
Droppin lethal raps on wax so I can count stacks
I keep a heavy knot, got a spot on every block
Honeys that’s very hot get slid to the Marriott
95' was a beautiful year for L
Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for L

Have y'all niggas runnin for homebase like Babe Ruth
Have you holdin holes in your body like you play flute
Lay you down til you get found up in the sprayed Coupe

Be found on the block with the street taped over

Yo, y'all fellas like to stress them chicks
Impress them chicks, spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send them home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 P.M
Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the gray BM
Went to the ATM, took a thou' out
Then later on I had to wild out
In the club, knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin - which chick number I could dial out
Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And that's ill, playa haters be givin me harsh looks
But I'm tryin to sell records like Garth Brooks
So eff 'em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega-ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo, I guess it's Perignon
If the na-na's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years
And cats is still thirst - to hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that want to battle;
Get a deal first - I sport the bulletproof, fitted hat
That attitude - you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What? I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin figures while you broke cats keepin it real
L is rap's most livest cat
I'm gettin stacks while you askin people
""Do you want fries with that?""
I rob fags in the staircase, no mask, bare-faced

With no release date, I sell in each state
I'm the type to drive to Philly, for a cheesesteak
So what I'm a Harlem king, doin my thing
My name ring - chains and dames what the fame bring
After platinum it's the same thing
And niggas'll never learn
Til I pull the steel and make they lover burn

Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded, niggas must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And I'mma gamble until he come back - why not?
Click-clack, cock the gat back, gotta be strapped
The game was mad packed, mad cats pockets was fat
They playin cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
After headcrack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, ""Hop the fuck in""
On my face he saw the grin and said, ""How much did you win?""
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, ""Yo son, I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs, bring your big gun""
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get, real hasty
Grabbed the steel, took it off safety
Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin, I'm feelin weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
To one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the buildin, staggerin
Lookin tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, ""Why?""
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
Damn, here comes a couple of cops; I pulled out
And started blowin they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holdin back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shootin, one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad, and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens, that means here comes the Jakes
But it's too late, I'm knockin on the pearly gates

Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes
I leave a trail of dead mic's
Where I'm from, niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a TEC stuck down your throat
I'm telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hotty stare
I keep a shotty near
It's the nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm know to roast
Until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most
I'm leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed
And got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids
I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak
Cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper
Fuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a whyle town
You know my style clown, so bow down

Word up! '95 style. I got my man Jay-Z here. Step up to the mic. Yo, word up! The single's called ""Put It On."" It's in stores right now. Produced by my man Buckwild. In the chorus, he got Kid Capri and got a LG remix which you heard a little while ago. Word up! Jay-Z!
 Stretch was wondering if that was a condom endorsement
 Oh nah nah nah nah
 Yo we got Jay, we also got ""Da Graveyard,"" right? That's coming up next? With Jay-Z on it? Well, we got Jay-Z in the place. What's up, baby?
 What's up, man? I just come up out that hectic party, man, down in the city, man. That shit was hectic, man. Cops sitting there with shotguns and all that. And that was an R&B party, man, you know?
 Yeah, well, the plague is everywhere
 It was probably Reef
 Yeah, it was probably mad Daddy Reef. Yo, he beat you up, you know what I'm saying, so?
 Yo, I don't give a goddamn who it was. I'm here now
 Yeah, you do your thing, baby
 So, you want this beat?
 Yeah, that shit is fine. Check it out, now. Check it check it check it out, now

Brothers can beg and borrow
Still feel sorrow
When Jay
Z like Zorro get in that ass
Better luck tomorrow
I'm too much, nigga, so never should you rush
You need slow down, or get your ass tore down
Check it out, I'm too cocky
To stop me, you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone, you can still feel me
On the real, B
The shit is eternal, I rock the Heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven
I raise hell, till its Heaven
Recognize, the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me, nigga, its bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin Crystal, shooting game like missiles
As projected, all ho's affected by this style
I mack like Goldie, go back like the oldies
But the goody, pulling R&B bitches wearing hoodies
They don't be knowing the way I be flowing
When I be going
I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things wit a swing and have em rocking like
You say never you run, if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I be producing like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding
I'm landing blows and
Knocking sense into those that oppose me, ha
Enticin when slicing through tracks
You're screaming, ""Jesus Christ,"" he's back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map
So give him his dap
And me, I just take mine
Gimme those, gimme this, gimme that, fuck that
You never see me stressed, in a GS
On the prize, my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping, extortion and corruption
So you know, beatin me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow, I'm too thorough, nigga
I make moves, cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
Um. We're the peace like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise, I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying, couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin
Ever since L said ""Throw three Gs in""
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself
I get up",https://genius.com/Big-l-stretch-and-bobbito-95-pt-i-lyrics
You Know What I’m About,The Danger Zone,2011,"When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about 5-0
A hardcore life, I chose to explore
Therefore I lived raw and went to war with the law
My only picture was a mug shot, slugs what thugs got
Pockets swellin' hot from sellin' tops on the drug spot
Gs was clocked, fat knots went in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
'Cause we could put the guns down and go one round
With the hands my man, I ain't the one, you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style 'cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child, I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two tecs in case your crew flex
I wet up the set in a sec and yell ""Who's next?""
To feel the wrath of a psychopath, shoots it up like Shaft
Turn your staff into a bloodbath then laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack, you're softer than jelly jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat
On one three ninth street, Malcolm X boulevard
It's full of hard brothers that's thick and quick to pull a card
I tell facts when the beat start
Listen here sweetheart, the Big L is street smart
I fuck ducks and they crews up, make 'em give the jewels up
For those who refuse I squeeze the uz and light them fools up
I had beef with this nigga named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
A beat down from Big L, that's what all pranksters get
Like Al Yankovic, I'm on some real gangster shit
I'm never fuckin' with no handicapped or crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
Crimes I committed, I'm a villain admit it
I'm the type to murder you then tell your moms I'm the kid who did it
Peace and love is somethin' that I don't rhyme about
Fuck what you heard, you know what I'm about

Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, you know what I'm about
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
You know what I'm about!

It's the man with the rough flow
Some niggas don't like me but I don't give a fuck though
Cause I'm in command y'all
I'm smackin' niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball
I ain't the funny type
To joke around I gotta get my motherfuckin' money right
'Cause I got the right game
Definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
I'm rolling numbers with no practice
I'm snatchin' up the dough like motherfuckers owe taxes
'Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin' head crack trips and makin' all the brothers mad at me
Word, I'm taxin' shit
I'm shittin' on niggas like I just had a laxative
Tryin' to earn props I ain't the one to see
You clowns'll fuck around and get played like a drum machine
Ya gotta find a better way
I'll pull ya card, your file, shit, plus your resume
'Cause I don't play clown
I gotta get mine that's why my face stay frown
I don't smile, don't try to pull my file
I'll lay your ass like tile, you know my motherfuckin' style
So just slow down 'cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a nigga's makin' dough now
And I'm livin' better troop
And I'm makin' more noise than a fuckin' heavy metal group
I'm a cool man, a brother with a smooth plan
That's why I'm seein' more papers than a newsstand
So peep it, don't try to run around or speak it
Point blank I keep my whereabouts secret
While niggas are packin' steel, actin' ill
I'm on the D.L. with a female and I'm stackin' bills
How I'm livin'? Everything is well
'Cause a nigga like me, yo I'm ringin' bells
Without doubt I got clout
Yo fuck that shit, yo you know what I'm about

Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, you know what I'm about!
Yeah! C'mon!
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out
Knockin' niggas off, knockin' niggas out

I Shoulda Used a Rubba,Lifestylez Ov Da Poor & Dangerous,1995,"I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, ""I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave.""
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 & Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'mma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her
 x2
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic
One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, ""Sweeheart whats your name?""
""I gotta man,"" ""I ain't ask you that.""
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, ""Fuck you bitch.""
Another girl walked by, I called her
""Excuse me what's your name"" ""Lorraine, what's yours""
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, ""L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?"" ""You'll see.""
Ayyo, my pockets was extra thick
""So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick.""
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'm a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick
 x4
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic
Ayyo L these bitches be burnin’ the dog shit outta niggas
, know what I’m sayin’?
Who you tellin’ man? These bitches nowadays’d have a nigga dick drippin’ lava

You know what I’m sayin’? Ayyo, these bitches’ll have a nigga, give a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin’ man
Okay…
Man fuckin’ with these hoes without a rubber nowadays is like bungee jumpin’ with a rope around your neck. That’s like playin’, , that’s like playin’ Russian roulette with a shotgun. Ayyo word, ayyo, ayyo man, fuck a rubber man, I’m a start puttin’ balloons on my dick, dog, ayyo I’m a start puttin’ suntan lotion on my dick or somethin’. Ayyo these bitches is triflin’ dog.

L be keepin’ niggas hearts pumpin’ like Reeboks
It's the nigga that bitches suck and sweat
Faggots I buck and wet
Disrespect and I'm a break your fuckin’ neck
I'm known to put a cap in a duck face
I spray guns, fuck mace
I'm a nutcase from a rough place
It's called Uptown
Front and get bucked down
Walk through with jewels on, that ass'll get stuck clown
I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix
Straight from H-E double hockey sticks
I'm the devil's son, like my song said
I smash niggas like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and my crew peel caps and carry gats like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near trash, so step to the rear fast
Before I have your queer ass cryin’ like tear gas
Every day I gain clout and my game sprout
Some niggas'll still be virgins if crack never came out
The Big L's hard to kill, when my squad gets ill
You better guard your grill, before you get scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin’ more holes in a nigga body than a golf course
I'm crazy quick to knock a duck off
I'll pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the fuck off
You'll get smoked like a Phillie fast
‘cause your shit is really trash
Fuck around, I’ll swing on ya silly ass
It's Big L the crime converter
Sayin’ peace to all the niggas in jail doin’ time for murder
I wreck the mic, plus the whole stage
Rockin’ cornrow braids
I'm killin’ muthafuckers like old age
Known to have a hottie open
I keep a shotty smokin’
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach, so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Marc Buchanan and North Beach
I'm makin’ rap hits, I snap flicks at mack chicks
Just the slim ones, you won't see L with no fat bitch
Yo I'm the nigga that they call A.W.O.L
Punks, I slay all, on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds, I spray clowns with trey pounds
Makin’ gs from transportin’ kis on Greyhounds
My shit is kickin’ like a sensei
I'm smoother than Ben Gay
Comprende?

 Yeah yeah, this is Joe the God, Terror Squad reppin

Yo, yo, yo
I'm from a place where them niggas don't, talk no shit
Where them wigs get split, where the guns forever click
Where the track stars come to warm up for a race
Blue and whites ride by and niggas yell, ""Fuck them Jakes!""
So much respect, I can lay dough on the floor
Walk away and come back without cats runnin off
I'm a model ho's wet dream, in her sleep
Performin X-rated fuck scenes, me goin deep
O.C. the Starchild, let your cameras record
I'm like a man bein honored at the Grammy awards
I pitch lines like fastballs, mush-out, rap my ass off
Knuckle gaze crumblin your glass jaw
Supreme figure, drink liquor, what team thicker?
""The Big Picture"" be the motherfuckin theme nigga
Flamboyant forever, this is how it goes
Pray we don't clap your way when the gats explode

 Where Brooklyn at?
 Yo B-K don't play
 Harlem World
 Where niggas get the money all day
 Boogie Down Bronx, specialize in gunplay
 Triboro, so thorough, always

Where I'm from, dudes get sliced, cause crews is trife
And you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
I'ma slide to the telly and abuse your wife
If I got one rubber, I'ma use it twice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
When I rock 'gators, hoes be like, ""Them shoes is nice""
Dimes I'm willin to hit, I stay drillin a chick
They all know I ain't shit, but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
'Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I blast the tech at your dome to leave you restin alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of sess 'til I'm gone
You got this nigga frontin like he the, main event
When his album ain't even last long, it came and went
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him
Niggas don't want it with L, they like, ""Anybody but him!""

 Where Brooklyn at?
 Yo B-K don't play
 Harlem World
 Where niggas get the money all day
 Boogie Down Bronx, specialize in gunplay
 Triboro, so thorough, always

Hoodied down with the mac, Boogie Down where it's at
Fuck around hear the sound of the gats
Wanna clown, we react, fuck that
Do you know what you do when you fool with Joey Crack?
I'm coke on the streets, I'm open for beef
I'm hoping you reach so we can go with the heat
I'm like a nigga that you just can't kill
Niggas spittin that hot shit, but just ain't real
Uhh, it's like you muh'fuckers frontin for me
Nuttin to see, when I'm the one you wantin to be
Lovin the stee', come through plush in the V
Got niggas mad 'cause they payin' while we fuckin for free
Make Trizz a household, live what I told
I only speak that true shit that I know
Besides y'all don't want it with us
A hundred or plus, killers that be livin to bust
What the fuck?


Yo Remi so crazy, rhymes be blazing
Styles just switch like hips on gay men
Trips to the Caymans, rich and famous
Rhymes so hot my spit be flaming
Benz be rimmed up, doo be pinned up
Bitch talk slick whole crew get hemmed up
My shit drastic, all type of tactics
Rip shit flip shit, spit shit backwards
Screw you, don't let the pretty face fool you
I kick shit like kung-fu and I jam like guns do
You got one? I want two like water, I run through
Psycho, make you wanna change your whole mic flow
Floss it, givin bitches lyrical abortions
Stay cautioned, my first shit was just a lil portion
I come back with more shit, playback some raw shit
You can't rock, so I'mma take your spot make you forfeit

 Where Brooklyn at?
 Yo B-K don't play

Games Females Play,The Archives 1996-2000 (Mixtape),2006.0,"Ey yo, what's up this is Big L, know what I'm sayin'
Calling to see how that joint, know what I'm sayin', came out

Hey yo fellas... Keep our eye open... watch out
Cos females be playing a whole lot of games like these

Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

I know this lady by the name of Katie, If you broke, she's shady
You got cash, she's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed
In Chanel, Guess, nothing less
Body got more curves than an S, I smoked the boots like Cess
And I confess the sex was the best (yes)
Within a week she had keys to my res
I done mad her my main squeeze and gave her G's to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Saying how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinking she was wifey, tricking ridiculous
Given her dues that was icey, I said it's over
And what I gave you, you can have that
It wasn't even her - it was myself I was mad at
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game


A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle


So watch out fellas... Watch out
You better watch out fellas
Yeah, you better watch out
Watch out fellas... You better watch out

I’m about as ridiculous as bankrolls, clothes and hostin' shows Smokin foes and strokin' hoes in the Poconos
I roll wit intruders looters and sharp shooters
Who spark Buddhas and fuck thick bitches wit large hooters
I grew up in the slums of greed
Known for Drawin guns with speed or
Sellin' tons a weed cuz I got sons to feed
Harlem’s where the thugs rest, in the slug fest
We sendin faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh

Champagne cooler filled wit Mo, Don, and Cristy

Doo Wop #5,Harlem’s Finest - A Freestyle History,2010.0,"I'm comin through y'all, with the Glock buckin'
Ya whole block duckin'
Every bitch that I'm fuckin' with now is cock-suckin'
It's like I'm allergic to not fuckin'
Ya niggas is faggots like Rock Hudson and Boy George
I destroy frauds with one verse
Nigga, we could knuckle up
Or we could let the guns burst
L is the type to murder your son first
To get my point across
Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the coppers
Y'all might as well join The Force
Where I'm from, believe me
Snitches get killed
Niggas be hustlin' daily
Tryna fuck more bitches than Wilt
Takin pictures in silk, gator'd up
Passport: dated up, hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch
But I ain't rape the slut, she gave it up
I runnin' with Wop, you runnin' wit' me
We runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together
But don't front, the guns is under the leather
Ready to ill
Ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin to Corle', you better be real
'Cause none of my niggas be lettin' me chill
My crew be deliverin' hot lead
When gats are clenched rappers I clap and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' up shit in rap events
It's like soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin'
The people yell
I'm rugged as hell, brothers can tell
That none of y'all niggas is fuckin' with L
When I'm that nigga ya expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time
My parents haven't met yet",https://genius.com/Big-l-doo-wop-5-lyrics
Stretch & Bobbito ’95 Pt. II,Harlem’s Finest - A Freestyle History,2010,"(Big L)
My crew be deliverin hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time, my parents haven't met yet
I'm feeling like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Guillianni hung
Never had a gassed head
Got loot cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'mma beat your faggot ass half-dead
I stomp white cops till their life stops
For a low price hops
Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
On 1-3-9 you don't want a block war
Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time a mack eleven bucks
I'm killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike, I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit, ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple hun
Fuck love, all I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown emcee's I be attacking quick
I'm on some rappin' shit and some car jackin' shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black ac
And put the gat to his cap, click-clack
Sorry jack but get up out of that
My .38 works great, so make a mistake and hesitate
And I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin
He started reaching
So I left him sleepin' with his temple leaking
Aight, back to my man Jay-Z here
(Jay-Z)
As soon as I grab it, I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it, I get it together like a marriage
I'm seeking all rappers, 
I'm on my p's and q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand, well, god-damn, don't you know my status
I'm flowing the fattest, mmmm that is, mmmm, I'm the baddest
No need to explain my name, the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me, they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinking that's hollow, 
the rhythm is too r-rugged to follow
I hit you like bam, biggity bam, bam, biggity bam
Let me take a little breath...god damn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up, nah, whenever I'm in the, uh
Whatever I touch, whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya, uh
The nigga don't play, hey, the nigga don't play, hey
Hahahhhh, here I come a-g-g-gain, run, up up up in
Niggas are do ducking I'm boo buckin', fuck it I'm whyle
But a boo boo boo bam, what you niggas gonna do to the man?
I see you brought your little crew... and?
I'm still comin' with velocity, check it out
Jid-a, id-a, wid-I, zid-e, uh huh
Ain't none of these clowns fuckin around
Ain't none of these clowns standing their ground
With the crowned prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on, sweat now
Jay-Z's on, be gone to the next town
Punk, jump up and get beat down
Check it out, check it out, check it out
Ladies be comin' out of their seats now
Shit I got crazy skills
It's a pity the way I'm ripping rugged rhythm through the city
Like dunnanna dunnanna di-di-dun dun ditty
I got rhythm, I, hit em with rhythm, I
Hit em and split em, I did em, I get rid of them guys

Dime pieces, shake that ass, show me love
This goes out to all of the above

I be that playa with the big street buzz, who all the freaks love
Braided hair, light moustache, a little peach fuzz
That slim guy, all my life been fly
Representin' one-three-nine, Harlem World, NY
Yeah!
Yo I was destined to be a star honey
Plus I rock jewels that cost car money
And cats like you never got rocks on
Rappin' bout Roleys, and got a Swatch on
Playa hatas don't wanna see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment C.E.O
Huh! (You know)
How cool can one MC be?
Ya'll still envy me, cause I'm MVP
Cruise through Harlem in a bulletproof MPV
Man, you fuck around and get plugged like MTV
Word!
My style is rough like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick, ugly bitches get the wrong number
I stay droppin' like April showers
Give me BET's address, so I can send Rachel flowers
And I'm rap most livest cat
Gettin' stacks while you asking niggas: Do you want fries with that?
Try to tax me, and watch the nine mil' burst
I've been off the scene over two years, and ya'll still thrist
To hear L drop a ill verse
And all you unsigned rappers that wanna battle, get a deal first
I'm quick to smoke an ounce with my thugs
This be that party shit that make you bounce in the clubs
I defeat creeps, with techniques, on elite beats
Always front row, never sittin' in the cheap seats
Boo, I got too much cash for that
I never date rape, I get too much ass for that
And do I walk around the streets broke?
No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the O.J. trial
Yo, my Harlem World playas, ya'll can shine with me
Got my own label now, so ya'll can sign with me
Ya'll can take it from the bottom and climb with me
It's fine with me, that's how it was designed to be
I'm in charge of all
Just threw a party at the Taj Mahal
Cause The Mirage is small
We gonna build like construction, real hot production
No playa hatin', just congratulatin'
And I'm known to taste a chick
Take her to my Harlem hideout and lace her quick
And believe me, I know the right place to lick
As long as I got a face, ya'll got a place to sit
I'm a true Don, from here to Huston
Strong like a Yukon
No more jelly, strictly Grey Poupon
Pretty ladies wanna see L
Fellas wanna be L
If I go to jail, you'll wear shirts saying: Free L",https://genius.com/Big-l-let-me-find-out-lyrics
School Dayz,Return of the Devil’s Son,2010.0,"Ay yo Rookie, is a game that a fool plays
I'm sitting here reminiscing about my school days
Ay yo I used to go mad fresh
Scoop the chick, stupid prick, get the digits and the address
Yo they was jocking, cause I was clockin fast cash
I slid a chick everyday after last class
Strictly a sex thang, let me explain
I hit 'em up, get 'em up, and put 'em on the next train
My trademark was black glasses, I cut the whack classes
Then slide off with some cutie pies with fat (hey)
Yo all the fellas was amazed
By the way I was macking females in my school days

Yes yes, y'all (here we go, here we go)

Ay yo the school I went to, a whole bunch rhymed
That's why it was battles everyday at lunch time
A brother battled me once it was plain whack
I played him so bad he left school and never came back
And in the lunchroom it was a Big L thing
I made so much noise that you couldn't hear the bell ring
One of us froze then dozed, to the top I rose
And got props when I rocked the school talent shows
My opponents got scarred fast
That's why when they see me they do the hundred yard dash
I left emcees and they whole crew phased
Yea, that's how I did it in my school days


When I first got inside high school, I wasn't known
I roamed alone but I held my own
I was a freshman, in other words, a new jack
When you mentioned Big L, brothers was like ""Who's that?!""
Then I made the master plan, now I got a batch of fans
So when you mention my name now, ""Oh, that's my man""
You see how, it's all about me now
All the girls scream ""Ow"" whenever I freestyle
When I roll the whole crews on the scenery
So those who envy me can't do a thing to me
I used to move alone, now my crew's fat
I went from a new jack to a new mack, that's true black
I'm cutting rappers like soufflés, I came off like toupées
Yea, that's how I did it in my school days",https://genius.com/Big-l-school-dayz-lyrics
Blackout Rap Show Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I be puffin' blunts in the house, hittin' stunts on the couch
This year, crazy cats gon' get punched in they mouth
When your wife see me, she don't know how to act
So don't be mad when I blow out her back; For real
Your whole crew's a buncha poo butts, made a few bucks
J'd a few sluts, then ya'll started runnin' your lips a little too much
Got chedda to blow, pockets never get low
Chickens sweat me wherever I go
Me and O.C. be in the Lex', Cartier specs, Nautica sweats
Gore-Tex, with Presidentials on, full of baguettes
I done sold coke, sold crack, sold smoke, sold smack
Now I wanna gold plaque, can I get a soul clap?
Some cats be col' wack
You got the lye? Well brother, roll that
And if it won't get me high, then hold that
I'mma cop me a six, and cruise through the block with your trick
I'mma keep droppin' them hits, it won't stop 'til I'm rich

Any mic I hold in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd, dictating shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic
Scolding, bringing somatic to this rap shit
Bona fide. Mic set, you can't see me on it
Master the art, so now I just flaunt it
Born to live a life and die, but 'til then
I'mma keep on writing slick rhymes with the pen
I take the cherry from a beat like a virgin havin' innocent
Bust my nut, bring rhyme to life like Genesis
Poetical renaissance, endeavors are flawless
Tearing it up when it comes to me picking up this cordless
One of New York's finest
On this trip, I coincide with Beatminerz
Bringing out the best in me
We formulatin' like a recipe
Water and dough, we sho' 'nuff
Bestow my presence
Then I'm divine like the seven
Keeping it tight, cause what I suffice is raw nigga
It's only right

Like that, y'all

It's like that, y'all

On the Blackout Rap show, with my man Phat Phillie
Check it out, uhh
We about to get into a verse like this
Check me out, y'all

Hmm-mmm

Yeah, yeah
A couple of years ago, before the year nine-fo'
My cash flow was low, I was low on dough
Used to try to talk to fly girls, and they was like: No!
I knew that all of that'd change once I started to blow
Now my pockets are bloated, because I exploded
Stay devoted, dropped a hot album, now I'm loaded
I hang with fly stars, buy cars, for fifty-thou'
The New York City child, thug with a pretty smile
I love this rap game, that's why I married it
It's a big load, but somebody gots to carry it
At one point I was about to give up
Then got offered a record deal, and my eyes lit up
In 1992, boo, my dream came true
First I got the fame, then the cream came through
Word up, I used to rhyme all the time
Whoever thought that slim kid from one-three-nine'd
Shine down the line, huh?
I used to sell cracks, now I sell tracks
Listen up, cause when L raps, he tell facts
I'm the type of cat to lay wack MCs to rest
I was told to work hard to achieve success
Words of wisdom from my father
He said: L, when things ain't going so well
Don't give up, try harder
And never be afraid to make mistakes
And don't spend your cash foolishly, save your papes
Cause good things come to those who wait they turn
Stay concerned, cause it's a lotta papes to earn
And help those that's less fortunate than you
And stay true to whatever you do, until you're through

Yo, uhh
O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you
O.C.'s illin', I will never, ever bore you
To rock like I do, it takes certain zest
I'm truly untouchable, like Elliot Ness
See, my word and verse is fly. One moment tranquil
Then the next minute it goes with the strength to kill
I can rock a party right, all night, just trust me
Not an MC out there who can touch me
Anywhere I go, young ladies, they rush me
When I'm on the mic, no way in hell you can hush me
My mere presence will leave you in awe
And when I'm through you too will call me pa-pa
Now is the time to settle this vendetta
Slicin' MCs like a Swiss-cheese shredda
If you don't like Swiss, then I cut you like chedda
Thick, slow and quick, great pain it will inflict
The beat's on time and the cuts all click
Elegant, never meant, I loves to invent
If you heard me say I rock, this is what I meant
I don't shriek, I speak, I could never be weak
I got the crowd overwhelmed with my rap mystique
I'm shrewd, never booed, I wear the MC crown
When I step in the place, MCs, they bow down
Suckas I will smash, they're not fit for the class
Yo, when we get on the mic, they break out like a rash
Cause my sonic, atomic MCs get moronic
Chillin' with Big L, we like: It's bionic
Charismatic, emphatic, bass has no static
Strungin' off the rhyme like a cocaine addict
Nothing but cheers, call O.C. the leader
Def rhyme writer, fake MC defeater
Girlfriend said you're sweet, but I'm sweeter
I'll slay any MC in this rappin' arena
Colossal, not a fossil, MCs are quite docile
Teach what I'm preaching, you can call me an apostle
Tall, not short, dog, and this is the sport
I'm a soldier with the mic, and I'm guarding my fort
And MCs are no bigger than my big toe
And I get higher rating than The Cosby Show
When I recite my rhyme, just for you, my friend
Big L, jump on this mic and flow once again

Yo it's L the Harlem
Check it out, bust it
Yo it's L, the Harlem pimp baby
For real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And that's ill
Playa hatas be giving me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
Forget em all
Yo, it's L the Harlem pimp baby, just like I said
Right now, I'm going off the top of the head
It's me and O.C., we be low-key
Chillin' in the cribs, iced-out Roley
Chillin' with my man, his name is Phat Phillie
I'm about to get illy, L is a willy
The Blackout Rap Show
I'm cool like my man, Fat Joe
Chew MCs like tobacco
O.C

Who's the fatso? No, not O
MC pro-rap, I can rip the show
With my man Big L, that's right, we representin'
Name is O.C., I'll put my foot indent in
Inside your butt like a slut on the call
MC war
Mics I storm
My man Big E is on the back of the side
MCs, pull away before I crash your ride

Check it out, check it out
O.C. I got your back, bro

I got your back

And we chillin' on the show called the Blackout Rap show
It's like that y'all
It's like that y'all
O.C. and L could never be wack y'all
Check it out, every time I flow it's a sensation
Check it out, like

Live motivation!

Uhh! Yeah, cuttin' MCs like Jason

What? We been the ill ???

I'mma set it off, then you gonna set it off next

One-two. Watch how we flex

Uhh, it's like that y'all
It's like that y'all

It's like that, we hit the cats with a base-bat, y'all

Right now, we tourin' all over the world

MCs, just dissin' your girl

Uhh, we cool. You know how we do

Takin' MCs to schools and we ain't no fool

Right now we gonna make this the very last line

Sucka MCs, O and L is on time

My clique is quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
You shoulda known not to roam through the Danger Zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest, in a slug fest
I'm sending faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums with greed, known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed, cause I got sons to feed
It's a must that my toast smokes, I'm not like most folks
Fuck tens and twenties, I carry ghost notes
And it's a must that I commence to slain
Any faggot MC who goes against the grain
I'mma smoke Pataki ass and Rudolph Giuli' like a wooly
I keep a tooly for any muli who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L, to hell is where I'mma send ‘em
After I skin ‘em and spit some venom in ‘em
I run with intruders, looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddhas and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
I'm the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
So when I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends, like there he go!
I never had rules to follow, none of my jewels are hollow
Try to take mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games, I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out, with suicidal thoughts
All my life I been a lady bruiser, a wrong chooser
School refuser, drug abuser, born loser
Clothes bummy, nose runny, it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
I'mma hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I’m better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward, so fronting on me, I won't allow it
I'm high powered, fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front, get your belly torn, I keep a Pelle on
I'm fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom Pérignon
Cause on the Ave. I pump rocks, quick to give a chump knots

I keep a pocket full, none of you niggas can touch my funds
I don't fight no more, all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed, I'm squeezing macs
Bustin' off caps, those coward cats, 
will go to platinum plaques get taxed
And I do jooks and sling pies to make cream rise
It's all about these green guys, front your whole team dies
How I'm, livin' so far swell you can't scar L

I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
She had big breasts, honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dancefloor, gettin our boogie on
I see the haters watchin me with they hoodies on
Tryin to peep the ice under the sleeve
I'm like, ""It's time to breeze,"" told honey, ""Let's leave""
Took her to Ema G's(?), got some eggs and cheese
Grits fishcakes and orange juice, freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal, I said, ""What's the deal
For real - you goin home or you tryin to chill?""
She got close, whispered somethin slow in my ear
And it ain't hard to tell where we goin from here

Guess I gotta be a ballplayin nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch, I ain't even wanna fuck
She runnin around, all open off Kurupt
The ho I thought, was gon' be real easy
Told me she got a man and he's some beatmakin nigga named Stevie
What's wrong with these hoes? I'mma fly nigga
I don't wanna go flip Mo' to Rah Digga

With some Dominican 'dro heads, ridin on top this
On the back of mopeds, titties all out - what what?

Is yo' game rusty? Around yo' dame, never trust me
Cause soon as you blink I'mma slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creepin cause I'm sneaky like that, uhh
It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin
And matter of fact, the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walkin crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait, cause I'm not on the patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name, it ring a bell
Ask any female, nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda, who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda

Jealousy, I expect that, I don't stress that
I want a cutie with some tight jeans on, that I can scheme on
Treat her nice, take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the U.S. I'm seen on

Pack a three-pound, that's my prerog' like B. Brown

The ""Danger Zone"" is where pies get cut, where all the guys get stuck
Try to front we gon' size you up
Like Corleone'll grab the chrome and throw five in your gut

Aiyyo, gats we bust (backs we crush)
Only hot tracks we lust (crazy stacks we clutch)
And we need plaques to touch (that say platinum plus)
Cause half of you niggas that's rappin now (is wack to us)

 Big L!
 Y'all know the name
 He's still here
Y'all thought this was over with?
This ain't over with..",https://genius.com/Big-l-still-here-lyrics
Tru Master,The Danger Zone,2011.0,"Yo while we hold gats, you hold knives
And when you sold eighth's, we sold pies
And when you rode bikes, we drove 5's
There's no comparison son, s'just embarrasing
I'm runnin' wit some of da baddest men in the whole New York
We hold the fort while you crab cats is holdin tips
Playa hatin, pushin stolen whips
We at da dice game rollin trips, out of town throwin bricks
Taking over, cooking up coke with baking soda
I buy hot jewels and ice it down, while you go to the jewellery store wit short doe tryna bring the prices down
You betta spread wit them 30 dollar kicks on
Or get whipped on, knocked out cold, and pissed on
L is a heavyweighter wit steady paper
You da type to go to jail for a petty caper
Then come home on good behavior
Talkin' bout you no longer hard now cause you a man of god now
Yo its amazing, L is blazing, always been
Before i put da braids in, i use to let the waves spin
What you be saying don't impress me at all
And them chicks u be jayin dont be sexy at all
Word life, everything that i recite stand out
Go head and front, so i can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw, L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce tha law
You got sumthin to say, then cough it out
Cuz cowards be wantin beef, but when u pull out the heat
They ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about, u was just frontin
Now it ain't nuttin, ain't that suttin
I should start bussing anyway
And put one of u punks in da ground
Ya'll cowards be killin me wit ya'll faces frown, jumpin around
Like u scaring L, not even, cause I'mma be a thug until i stop breathin
Plus I'm runnin with a smooth ass crew, that'd shoot at u
You wanna knuckle up, whateva we can do that too
Ya'll fellas like to stress them chicks, impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks, i sex them chicks
Then send them home, corleone is known to be stoned
When i bone, i rubber duck in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm, pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the grey BM, went to the ATM
Took a thou' out, later on i had to wild out
In da club, knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards, went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now im thinkin what chick number i can dial out
Cuz its L, the harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes then that sprint lady, and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks, but im tryna sell records like Garth Brooks
So f em all, when its cold i throw the skelly on
Illegal chips, keep my celly on, mega ice is what im heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo, i guess its Pérignon
If the na-na's too tight, i throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
I've been off the scene over 3 years and cats is still thirst
They hear Big L drop a ill verse, so all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first
I sport da bulletproof, fitted-hat, that attitude you betta get rid of that
Whereava u floss is where u gon get it at
What
I stay strapped, i go to sleep wit my steel
Makin figures while u broke cats keepin it real
L is rap's most livest cat, im gettin stacks while u askin people ""do u want fries with that""
I rob fags in da staircase, no mask, bare face
The one police wouldn't dare chase, keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes? No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the OJ trial",https://genius.com/Big-l-tru-master-lyrics
Games,The Big Picture,2000.0,"Yeah yeah, watch us turn it up for y'all
Tight broads watchin
The Guru, the great 'Dat X, and Big L
Flamboyant for life

Check it, a year ago, I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro, then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, Monique
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get something to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dying to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right, it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it, we was doing our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claiming she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that, I wore a Lifestyle

Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

I'm in the breed of the bad guy
Get caught in a mad lie, come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
And think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin witchu
Had said some ol' slick shit, that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin swell, how you gon' fuck my man L
Like we don't cross paths in these New York streets?
But that's good, cause he's my man and we both shine
And to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted;
Things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it, think back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted, she ain't never resisted
Left it red and blistered, shakin
I could slam it if it wasn't NO money makin


Games, these girls now-a-days they play many
Techniques for getting your loot, they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick, just for some ice and shit
In the beginning they're polite, actin all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushing your Land
When she got you - she goes and fucks your man
Understand, you gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud, they'll set you up Baby Pah
Some'll try to get you stuck up, some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough, and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a ho a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick - could be a lifetime bid
A lot of cats be beefing over these honeys
Not me I keep it moving they ain't getting jack from me
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
And one love to L we gon' stay Flamboyant


Yo son you better watch these little fast-ass
Little fancy-pants bitches with the thongs
Heh, that's my word
Yo, rest in peace to my man Big L,
 uhh
Peace to the God Sadat X
Guru, GangStarr, uhh
Hold it down",https://genius.com/Big-l-games-lyrics
New York,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Big L:
I drink Moet not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin rappers in the wheelchair, Big L is the villain
You still fear, cause I be hangin in Harlem and my shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread, you can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin, I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sherriff in town, and it ain't Reggie Hammond
2Pac:
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home
Big L:
Aiyyo, you betta flee Hobbes, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rapper's hearts pumpin like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be vergins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go boom-boom, and yo' guns go wow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open, I keep the shottie smokin
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopie
I run with sturdy clicks I'm never hittin dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, Buddy don't make it thirty-six
Biggie:
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
Jadakiss:
Uh, I learnt the game, I know what I want and I'm in it
The time is now, it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a ***** in the eye, you could tell if he tinted
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks
They act like it's all love, only love is your money
So when it's over *****, are you a thug or a dummy
I'm neither, but I been hot so long, it feels like I got a lifetime fever
And I ain't gotta spit, I could cough and still eat ya
And f*** rap I make mills of reefer
I'm a man first, tired of punchin *****z, so I'mma shoot *****z cuz my hands hurt
And God is great, guard ya space
One hand wash the other, both wash the face
And I head crack so much, it's hard to ace
.38 revolver flow, its hard to trace, what!
Fat Joe:
Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie, even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Mase is back, I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin crazy how they're AK spit
But we know this investigatin, and they ain't spray shit
Not me, I'm the truth homie, got the industry shook like
""Naw nigga, Joe gonna let em loose on me""
True Story, I'm bringin the T back
Even Roy Jones was forced to ""Lean Back""
My nigga Dre said grind cook
Now we killin them hard niggas, who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling, like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke, crack, niggas fiend for that

Times Iz Hard,Devil’s Son EP (From the Vaults),UnKnown,"I used to be a rich nigga, selling much crack
To make a long story short, I fell off like a hubcap
My operation got shut off
I can't slide a slut off
I gotta beat my dick to get a nut off
Cause when a convo is struck up
Bitches act stuck up, my luck sucks, everything is fucked up
To get cash I gotta beg
Cause every time I reach in my pocket all I feel is my damn leg
Its about time that I feel cash, gotta get it right now, gotta get it real fast
Cause all I got left is two MAC-10s, a army jacket, a ski mask, a hoodie, and some black Timbs
I'm about to get extra ill, so I went to my crib, got booted up and got dressed to kill
The first place that I hit was the corner store
I pulled out and told everybody to get on the floor
I took the cash and I jetted
One kid tried to set it
I bet he regret it cause because he got wetted
Robberies I did well
When you look in the dictionary under villain you'll see a photo of Big L
Fuck a job, punks is gettin robbed and scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard

Yo I was robbing people on a regular basis in many different places and all types of races
I robbed gangstas, I robbed ducks, I didn't care who I stuck as long as I got a buck what the fuck
When niggas see me they take flight
I'll even rob Jehovah if I catch him right on a late night
Keep a vest G don't try to test me
A redneck police chief tried to arrest me
Ayo that wasn't a smart cop
Because I put 2 in his chest and his motherfucking heart stopped
Its a must I commit crimes
Cause I gotta get mine, its hard times, and all I see are dollar signs
Why should I work for another sucker
When I can do robberies and make G's like a motherfucker
Fuck a job, punks is getting robbed and scarred
Cause times is hard on the boulevard

Yo I was goin out, just like a crusader would
I robbed everything that moved in the neighborhood
Yo I was even robbing chicks
I did mad sticks, I needed more dough so I started taking hits
Blastin ducks with the shotty
The trigger I squeeze with ease I got paid 50 g's per body
In a year I killed 88
So I made about... umm... fuck it I was crazy straight
Fuck a job, punks is getting robbed and starved
Cuz times is hard on the boulevard",https://genius.com/Big-l-times-iz-hard-lyrics
Principal Of The New School,Return of the Devil’s Son,2010,"I got the gift of gab
To lift and grab
The mic
And recite hype rhymes
That’ll rip and rag
And drag
A fag MC
Who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot
Talkin’ about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle troop
Rhymes I hook up, MCs I cook up
Like Campbell’s Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you’ll get bust an’ dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack
‘Cause I got ‘em down pat
Your rulin’ time is over
So gimme your crown jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get wit’ me hops
That’s why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine ‘cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn’t kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I’m smoother than Vaseline
And I’m a stone cold rappin’ fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin’ out, but that’s cool
‘Cause I’m the principal of the new school
I recite hype rhymes that shine like rainbows
I pick up the microphone and play MCs like game shows
And suckas are coppin’ pleas while I’m clockin’ gs
Try stoppin’ these, lyrics nigga please
Cause my rhymes are ill like a kid with a bad cold
Your style is mad old, you’re small as a tadpole
This is a giant here, an MC rap pioneer
Before you battle me chief, go throw on your riot gear
I’m hardcore, comin’ outta wars jus’ barely bruised
Makin’ MCs go on strike like the daily news
But there aren’t gonna be any comebacks
Sayin’ them bum raps, your lyrics are dumb whack
I wreck shows and explode like a landmine
‘Cause L kicks the deadliest shit known to mankind
Front on me, you’ll be history like last week
‘Cause rappers be frontin’ hard and booty like ass cheeks
I’m hotter than Florida
I gets raw with a, mic
Slammin’ niggas like the Ultimate Warrior
The subject, the predicate
L kicks better shit
Couldn’t get passed me if your homeboy set a pick
Try to play me out like a cub scout
Better get the fuck out, my face
Or get placed, in a casket
It’ll be a tragic, incident
What a coincidence
My rhymes are infinite
Like math
And I go to work in a suit fool
‘Cause I’m the principal of the new school
The lyrics that I’m kickin’ are like lethal weapons
Every time that I pick up a mic I see you steppin’
‘Cause you want no parts of the L
Hear the sound of my voice, ya start bitin’ your fingernails
‘Cause you’re petro, and my lyrics are death so
Could you win a battle against me? Heck no
I just cruise and get smooth on the rap tip
Go ahead, bite my lyrics and get a fat lip
Or a broken jaw, you’ll get more than a beatin’ troop
Fuck around you’ll be eatin’ soup
‘Cause I’m a brother who likes to party hard
Nice with my hands so I don’t need a bodyguard
MCs be walkin’ the streets jus’ col’ frontin’
Step to this and get beat like you stole somethin’
‘Cause I’m not the man to be step to
I won’t let you, ruin my repu-tation
Across the whole nation
Rappers that be basin’ I’m choppin’ like Jason
I kick so much flavor you should call me the flavor man
Here, take my autograph ‘cause you’re a major fan
Of the L, ‘cause you like the way I’m kickin’ flavor
Hot as an oven but cool as a refrigerator
MCs be bitin’ my lyrics like a stone thief
Believe me chief, you want no beef
So give those lyrics back, to the right owner
Or get beat until ya fall in a coma
And physical contact, you don’t want that
So gimme what’s mine and there’ll be no harm jack
‘Cause where I’m from we don’t like that thief shit
And I’m the last rapper who you wanna beef wit’
‘Cause chumps I overrule
I’m invincible and the principal of the new school",https://genius.com/Big-l-principal-of-the-new-school-lyrics
On the Mic,139 & Lenox,2010,"Aiyyo I shoulda been out, I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin', almost tried yo' chin out
I knocked a lot of men out
I left em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'mma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me, she must like women
Everytime I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad cuz your career's in the ninth inning
It's over now, nigga leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where MC's get slain
Where thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey, 48 Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT your bitch wrote me
First day home, I dived in it, left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
MC's I squash and disgrace
It's all about the Benji's, so why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin', mad singles wit a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac cuz they really were hot
Rap game heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer wit us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail, you'll wear a shirt sayin' ""Free L!""

Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit

Da UnExpected Flava,Devil’s Son EP (From the Vaults),UnKnown,"Yo I'm the one who made you get on the dance floor
And shake 'til your pants tore, so party people clap your hands for
The one they call Big L
I'm hot as hell, I'm livin' swell
My name's ringin' bells, can't ya tell?
So grab the Moët and take a sip
I stay lookin' dip, mics I rip, but don't flip
We on the party tip
I get so loose, on tracks that I produce
MCs be frontin' mad hard but got no juice
I'm not the type that strikes out when I pull mics out
Violate L and it's lights out
And if you got no skills on the mic you oughta dash
Cause rappers that're sorta trash, the Big L slaughter fast
I'm gettin' high rates in all states, makin' papes with the crew called:
Diggin' in the Crates!
I'm a rap crowd amazer, microphone dazer, Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Now when I'm on the stage microphones I lock tight
The Big L rock right when I'm in the spotlight
Yo I'm a young dapper rapper that dress well
Foes I expel, the ladies wanna sex L
Because my raps are real raw
I'm hard as a steel door, with skills most MCs'll kill for
I'm known for grabbin' the mic and then droppin' a raw rhyme
Big L's the greatest of all times, so gimme my props, I want all mines
Battles I refuse to lose, I chose to cruise smooth like the blues
I never hear boos cause I abuse
In '93 I'm blowin' up like dynamite
And don't think I can't fight because I'm kinda light
L's a teenage poet that men fear
Chief to be sincere, you got no wins here
I play MCs like a game of Sega
Cause I'm poetic, and this is the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Now I'm gonna kick flave 'til the microphone's broke
And I'm known to do the wild thing like Tone-Loc
I screw whores, I do tours, I'm smooth like Lou Rawls
I write raps that hurt MCs like blue balls
In all zip codes, the Big L rip shows
You couldn't touch this if you was on your tip toes
I live in the ghetto and rap is my route out
Now I'm on wax givin' my crew a shout out
Since I'm paid I could knock any ho' boots
But L wasn't so cute when I had no loot
Now I'm lookin' slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my dick
Ayyo my cards I'm playin' well
Picture that, a rapper slayin' L? No way in hell
My rap skills are sharp like a razor but don't sweat it
This is the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Once again it's the man with the flava

Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah yeah-yeah
UHH! This goes out to all the wolves (*ARF ARF AROOOO*)
Hah, in the streets and in jail
Yeah, yo it's your man Big L
One-three-nine, Danger Zone
I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out, uhh - bust it
Aiyyo I just left the studio, and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And it's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the Jeep, stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep; my voice is hoarse, barely can speak
I called back on the cell - it's Corle', mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
""I just seen Mike and Ben with your wife and a friend
And they just got a room at the Holiday Inn""
""It's my wife, you sure?"" ""Yeah I'm sure
I saw the whore soon as she walked through the door""
""Say no more, which one?""
""The one in Jersey son, right over the bridge""
""We goin' hurt those hoes"" ""AND hurt both of them kids""
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes, doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to buck them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Coleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill, lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cut
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
""Yo, who that in the background?"" ""It's Tommy Gibbs""
""Oh, I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready? We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared, there's no time to back out
We gon' take the backroute
Pull the gats out, throw the mask on
We ain't leavin til everyone's dead, and all the cash gone
We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do"" ""So let's do it!""
I stepped to the deskclerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt
""They just walked in, party of four, two chicks, two males
What room they got?"" She paused and said ""212""
I took the steps now I'm out of breath; I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon' be the cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now, cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door, let the Glock off, tore the lock off
Took a deep breath, then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced, I shoulda shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in, each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin
These two crab cats, we know they hustle upstate
We know they got stacks
Cause they don't fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose
And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back
""You wanna live then tell my nigga where you stash the work at""
He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there, I found 50 ki's in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass, and two million in cash
I was dumb glad, the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three, filled 'em all up to the teeth
Then put the bags in the van, then I locked the truck
When I got back, Corle' done popped them punks
""Aiyyo fuck it L, we might as well pop these studs""
Now that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's, split the money threeways
Now we all laughin hard, gettin nice and weeded
Celebratin nigga, heist completed",https://genius.com/Big-l-the-heist-revisited-lyrics
Hit It,The Archives 1996-2000 (Mixtape),2006.0,"Can I hit it? (Yes you can!)
Can I hit it? (Yes you can!)
Can I hit it? (Yes you can!)

What's up boo, how you do?
I've been watching you and you don't have a clue and this ain't nothin new
Come to the crib, I got a beautiful view
And a heart-shaped water bed made for two
Uhuh, I do my thing when it's humping time
So all you cuties that wanna bump and grind, jump in line
Let me zoom in the boom like Wreckx
When I'm through your nets
Cos I'm a fiend when it comes to sex
Am I the man? (True that)
Of course you knew that
I'd give you the world, but trick my ends, I don't do that
I'm ready to get my flirt on
One honey with the skirt on
She got knees that I would love to put some dirt on
Come here shorty, let's drink a forty and get naughty
Go get your crew, I'll go get mine and let's make it an orgy
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it (why?)
It's just room to hit it


So all my ladies are you with me, where you at?
Let me hit it from the back and tell you if it's good or wack
When I'm all alone I call honey's on the phone
And Tell 'em come see me, but if we ain't gonna bone then keep your ass home
I used to mate with this honey Kate
The sex was great
Her shape would make a sweet playa turn straight
When you mention my name it rings a bell
Ask any female, nobody does it like L
That's why the ladies wanna meet me, discreetly
Cos I'm freaky and love to go deep sea
Fishing, I be caressing em', strickly sexing em'
You know my style, I'm Down with O.P.P. like Treach and em'
I get the woman loose quicker than gin and juice
Sometimes I wanna jiggy to sporting gators and linen suits
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it? (Why?)
It's just room to hit it


Around your girl you shouldn't trust me
Cos soon as you turn your back I'mma slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of brothers I know are taking care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low, I'm freaky like that
I even hit my mans girl cos I'm sneaky like that (huh!)
It ain't my fault your girl me ho-hoppin'
And matter fact the last time you gave her loot to go shopping
She picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walking crooked and her throat hurts
I hait to wait cos I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off, we don't need a relationship
I practice safe-sex so I keep the latex
Looking through the Rolodex to see who I'mma slay next
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it? (Why?)
It's just room to hit it",https://genius.com/Big-l-hit-it-lyrics

You better flee Hops, or get your head thrown three blocks

It's the nigga that bitches suck and sweat
Faggots I buck and wet, disrespect and I'm a break ya f*ckin neck
I'm known to put a cap in a duck face, I spray guns, F*ck Mace
I'm a nutcase from a rough place, it's called Uptown
Front and get bucked down
Walk through with jewels on, that ass'll get stuck clown
I got styles you can't copy bitch
It's the triple six in the mix
Straight from H-E double hockey sticks
I'm the Devil's Son, like my song said:
I smash niggas like cornbread
You can't kill me - I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and me crew peel cats and carry gats like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near trash, step to the rear fast
'Fore I have ya queer ass cryin like tear gas
Every year I gain clout, and my game sprout
Some niggas'll be virgins if crack never came out
The Big L's hard to kill, when my squad gets I'll
You better guard your grill, before you gets scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin more holes in a nigga body than a golf course
I'm crazy quick to knock a duck off
I'll pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the f*ck off
You'll get smoked - like a Phillie fast
Cause ya shit is really trash
F*ck around, I swing on ya silly ass
It's Big L the crime converter
Sayin peace to all the niggas in jail doin time for murder
I wreck the mic, plus the whole stage, rockin cornrow braids
I'm killin motherf*ckers like old age
Known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach, so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Martin Cannon and North Beach
I'm makin rap hits, I stab flicks and mack chicks
Just the slim ones, you won't see L with no fat bitch
Yo I'm the nigga that they call AWOL
Punks - I slay all, on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds I spray clowns with trey pounds
Makin G's from transportin keys on Greyhounds
My shit is kickin like a sensei
I'm smoother than Ben Gay

Violate or try to fake jack and you’ll get moved on
Peace to all my niggas with the thousand dollar jewels on
Pushing rides with four lift minks with gator shoes on
I am known for rockin tours, picture me moppin floors
Only fuck with keys and not the kind that be locking doors
The type of nigga that be gaming your freaks
While you out working hard, I'm putting stains in your sheets
Exportin Coogi and Gucci, that's my duty
Fuck a big booty groupie
Need a fruity, cutie hoochie with lots of loot G
This goes out to my niggas uptown, downtown, midtown across town and out of town

My cash flow don't get low it just increase
Who ever try to take mines a rest in peace
I keep a stoned look, peace to every known crook
Not those who go to jail and can't hold their own and come home shook
On 139 and Lennox niggas are bananas, we got bad manners
Cops can't stand us, that's why they try to jam us
But I hate jakes they mad cause I make papes
I am large like the great lakes, with drug spots in eight states
I'm chillin makin sure this money is right
Sippin Sunny Delight, hittin every honey in site
And I wanna smoke Pataki and Rudolph Gulie like a wooley
I keep a tooley for any moody who act fooley
What I recite be taking hours to write
So if you bite, just tell your man what type of flowers you like
So bloodshed, aiiyo my, mellow my nigga

Okay good Big L!

Tell me if this was suffice, or if it's somethin mayo .. outta here

This is the frosted flakes right here

This is the Lord Finesse beat

Yeah, yeah let me see, check it out

You can ball with this

One-two, one-two
Kinda tired..
Big L, 'bout ta.. get into some shit
Aight check it out
Yo, fuck all the glamours and glitz, I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expandin my chips
You mad cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne, that you know in your heart
I got style, plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle, sellin blow in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
Forever - hottie huntin, trigger temper I'm quick to body somethin
You lookin at me like I'm probably frontin
I fuck around and throw, three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm, older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin around y'all, cause niggas like you
Be prayin on my downfall, hopin I flop
Hopin I stop, you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe, smokin the rock
I got more riches than you, fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more, stitches than you
Fuckin punk, you ain't a +Leader+ what? Nobody +Follow-ed+ you
You was never shit, your mother shoulda swallowed you
(Mmmm.. WHOO!) You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit
Do me a favor, please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever, put your money up
Put your jewels up, no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead, and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red, I'm far from broke, got enough bread
And mad hoes, ask Beavis I get nuttin Butt-head
{*laughter*} My game is, vicious and cool
Fuckin chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come, you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from?
(YEAH!) So what you actin for?
You ain't half as raw, you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga sum'un, 'fore I crack his jaw
You runnin with boys, I'm runnin with men
I'mma be rippin the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
Have y'all niggas like, ""Damnit this nigga done done it again""
I throw slugs at idi-ots, no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch, eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm makin wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
 YEAHHH! (What?)
 I'm TIRED
 For somebody tired, that wasn't, that wasn't too bad!

You wrote... yeah... you where.. you where thinkin' bout somebody when you
Wrote that right?

Nah, all my shit like that, cause lately niggas been battlin' on the block
Lately

I could tell you wrote that ready for somebody

Yeah, yeah niggas been up on some... (sharpened up the swords)

You sharpened the pencils for that one

Aight, we gone hit it like this, check it out
Yo check it, yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken, I should rob you
But with that cheap shit, you ain't worth stickin'
I've got a left hook, that be leavin' guys knocked out
Keep frontin', and I'm a choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing, swing right back
Battle Corleone, why do a stupid thing like that?
Yo, I'm not in the mood, son, so don't push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight, grippin' my dick like a pair of pliers
You fuckin' snitch, right now you prolly wearin' wires
It's not a joke, so as soon as he laugh
I'm a strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass 
Leave him heart-broken, make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done, so no it ain't no parts open
I'm not a sweet stud, I'm a street thug
That's quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug, till he leak blood
You sure soft, watched you fall off, might slide your whore off
Then call all off, and tear your jaw off
My life is far out, I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out, go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain't a player, put that cigar out
Take that suit off, before I shoot off, and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst, put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse, should have tried these other cats first
Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join, I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too, I'll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into, you lame-ass nigga
No dough, always on the train-ass nigga
Canal street, 10-karat-chain-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate, you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take?
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half {*laughing*}
Yo, I'm a take you out your misery 
And after this, nigga, put you in the social study book cause you're
History
Yeah

Aiyyo I'm gonna be on ti-dop

Yeah surprisingly
I've been laying
Waiting for your next mistake
I put in work
And watch my status escalate
Now I'ma start collectin props
Connectin plots
Networkin like a conference
Cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down
Haters wanna take me down
Break me down
CLAP all they heard was the sound
Yo I scoped it out
I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch don't really got no ass
She just poked it out
On the d-low
I'm saying,you versus me though?
We can do this shit right here
In front of your people
See time is money kid
And BS walks
And to me
It's funny kid when you meet heads talk
I see Feds stalk
They wanna dig up the dirt
Son is it me they hawk
Cause I be puttin in work Son?
Aiyyo I'm gonna be on ti-dop
That's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine
Yeah surprisingly
I've been laying
Waiting for your next mistake
I put in work
And watch my status escalate
You cornballs get stonewalled
Blackballed I own y'all
The veteran
Running my plan I'm the better man
Crazy raw
Doing my job like the mob
Blazin y'all
And disappearing in the fog
Or a mist
And chicks can't resist what I kick
They be beggin for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up baby, someone may have to get hurt up baby
Shit is mad shady, but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a tech
Keep you hittin the deck, feelin heat in your chest
Bangin your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for goin where he should not
Viciously, I make history, instantly
Those other lame ass loser ass niggas, they can't fuck with me
I'm doin my thing now, to lamp later on
Paid in the shade, with some fly gators on
But now I'm grimy as they get, mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggas out here know, I be puttin in work
Aiyyo I'm gonna be on ti-dop, that's all my eyes can see
Victory is mine, yeah surprisingly
I've been laying, waiting for your next mistake
I put in work, and watch my status escalate
 ""For the qualified pros""

Fuck them other cats I'm runnin with my own wolfpack
Keep frontin like you's a thug and get your dome pushed back
Cause you don't get down that tough shit you talk is profound
You's a clown, fuck around come uptown and get found
I keep my pockets wrong none of you niggas never can touch my funds
I don't fight no more, all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed I'm squeezin Macks, bustin off caps
Those coward cats with gold and platinum plaques get taxed
And I do jooks and sling pies that make cream rise
It's all about these green guys, frontin your whole team dies
How I'm livin so far swell you can't scar L
Head of the cartel, sellin more cakes than Carvel
And I'm, labelled a kind thug, police got my line buck

Word up, I use a chrome gat to push domes back

I stay jewel-ed up, pockets swelled up
From banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep, in the triple black, dark-tinted o' jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn'
On the block all alone
And put a Glock to his dome
Tell him: Give it up quick, you nitwit, don't try to get slick
Or I'mma let this four-fifth spit, and leave your shit split
Prick, it ain't nothin' decent about me
A true thug for real, you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junky, don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be frontin' a lot
Poppin' mad shit, tryin' to be somethin' they not

You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin’ this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Wes’ blast
So jus’ dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don’t get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smoke ‘cause these knuckles hurt
I’m from the alley not the valley
I’m hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I’d rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don’t hang with jive pals
Adiós, ghost, I’m five thous’

Flave it’s always easy for new bait
Taken here to groove quake
Make ya more addictin’ than tube steak
‘Cause when I work a line, nobody’s jerkin’ mine
So bring the noise an’ I’ll poison like turpentine
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass rubber, your rhymes left trash gutter
I’ll leave chumps done, don’t come with some junk son
‘Cause I’m makin’ flave niggas cool for consumption
I’m more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it’s too late for that lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow up
Sour luck, niggas got popped an’ swallowed nut

On the mic, I rip the scene right
Terra just caught wreck, so I guess I got the green light
Niggas know about Herb McGruff
I’m on some murder stuff
And when I talk every verb is rough
MCs are live but I’m mad liver
Ayyo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this an’ get sliced with ease
Ate up like rice an’ peas
(Herb can you fight?) Yo I’m nice with these
Put up your dukes, then me an’ you cook raw
‘Cause I stand tall an’ kick ass like a football
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from hell
I’m the fuck up outta here

Ayyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I’ma melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews ‘cause I'm bad news
In a mad move I'm servin’ brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this an’ get your body blown
‘Cause I'm a no maricón for poems and slidin’ hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Ayyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice
And cold take a fag's life
My swellin’ melon got niggas gellin’
Ayyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo I’m bustin’ chumps like a Glock ten, when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill ya show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail kids get nailed and read Braille when they fail
Yeah and I’m nasty, too nasty to trash me
Bash me, ayyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that’s sawed off
And when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
For dissin’, you’ll come up missin’, like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like flesh ‘cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines an’ tecs an’ never shot a water gun
But Killa Kam I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease ‘cause once I release
My crew from the east, we leavin’ at least
Twenty police deceased, it’s the beast on attack
So make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats an’ black macs
On Lenox Ave. ain’t no light looks, you fight crooks
Left an’ right hooks, if you front, get your life took

I'm havin’ nail sharp pains in my brain like a hell raiser
I'm blazin’ trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin’ but lead
Boom bye-bye then find another batty boy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call ‘em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein’ heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up to keep my head straight

I should never rhyme ‘cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
‘Cause they know when I start droppin poems
That I be knockin’ domes, poppin’ bones and sendin’ niggas hoppin’ home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin’ to see me, nigga, bring a cast an’ crutches
And niggas, I don’t need a gun for you, none of you
‘Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my number two
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn they motherfuckin’ ass to ash
No need to question am I nice, ‘cause it's a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a mac ten
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm ‘bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin’ it tough

I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded wit rocks
Hustlin on hot corners that be smuggled wit cops
I was sworn for harlem, true roach don
Word bond, we leave mics torn
Yall brothers slept too long, now its on
L Corleone will neva fly
Records are forever hot
Front on me you better not
I keep the barreta cocked
This goes out to my people's up town
Downtown, mid town, across town, and outta town
You see me flossin often, at all the club sites
At the bars buyin crystalls like they bud lights
My style is hard like strong lumber
Dime pieces get the digits chicken heads get the wrong number
Yo I announce spacks
When I get busy over bounce tracks
Droppin lethal raps so wack so I can count stacks
I keep a heavy knot, got a spot on every block
Hunnies thats very hot
And sent to the mary yacht
95 was a beautiful year for L
Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for L
Whatever I write is gonna be tight
Cuz if makin hits is wrong I dont wanna be right
Never the less, the east is were my crew rest
We bust caps that go through vests
We only do what we do best
And thats triple than you riddle men
Since you wanna play rough, then say hello to my little friend
I like drop tops when its hot
I like lands when its snowy
Bank account is fat like Joey
Im not very religious you wouldn't call me holy
Sometimes my hairs corn row, sometimes its froly
Spark up the you know what
Pop the moey
L stay flossin, presidential doughly
Yall brothers know me, I step in parties with minks and fly links
Shorties hittin me with eyewinks as I buy drinks
And every girl I got looks like a model
If you ever see me with a chicken then she must of a hit the lotto
Uptown is my home, and where I roam
I stand alone, Big L Cornleone got a song
Sellin weight in and outta state to generate cake
The one jakes hate
Got homicide runnin out of yellow tape
I pack toast with infra red scopes, I turn crews to dead folks
If yall fellas is playas, Im the head coach",https://genius.com/Big-l-power-moves-lyrics
I Won’t,Return of the Devil’s Son (Deluxe Edition),2010,"Aiiyyo, some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
(Pause)
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven, which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them... and never will

I'm only at the age of 10
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
Cause my moms be smoking mad crack
My dad went out for a fast snack, and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel, it's quite ill
Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it (uh-huh, uh-huh)
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'

It seems like my life's been cursed
Ever since I was a child,
 and how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I walk around with a frown; I got no reason to smile
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
Aiiyyo times was rough, I had to grow up foul
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how
I always knew that I'd end up doing time on the Isle
And how will I make it?
I won't, that's how

Five years passed by, now I'm at the age of 15
No more fun and games, it's time to get cream (word up)
Cause I'm about to burst, it's like my life was cursed
I went to church, prayed everyday
And it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets, slate robbing suckers for funds (give it up, give it up)
Now everyday I creep with the heat
Ain't nothing sweet, I rob for meat
If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar
Then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living hell
Then I started to realize – I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep, now I can eat
Can't hit skins, but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street
Aiiyyo I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'


Doing time was full of stress G, all the
Fighting's and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease; I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic
Cause I'm broke, get up naked
And can't get a job cause of my jail record
Before you know it, I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for they change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered, but do I deserve it?
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot (word up)
I just can't take it (uh-huh)
And every day I ask myself, 'how will I make it?'


Word up man, it's real rough out here man
In the ghetto, all you can wish for is a better tomorrow
It ain't getting no better, it's only getting worse, word up...",https://genius.com/Big-l-i-wont-lyrics
Clinic (I Shoulda Used a Rubber),UnKnown,UnKnown,"What have I done stuck my dick in?

I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joelle, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joelle in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, ""I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave.""
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 & Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'mma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her

I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic
One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, ""Sweeheart whats your name?""
""I gotta man,"" ""I ain't ask you that.""
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, ""Fuck you bitch.""
Another girl walked by, I called her
""Excuse me what's your name"" ""Lorraine, what's yours""
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, ""L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?"" ""You'll see.""
Ayyo, my pockets were extra thick
""So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick.""
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'mma a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting older
Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a piss
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

I shoulda worn a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo L these bitches be burnin’ the dog shit outta niggas, know what I’m sayin’?

Who you tellin’ man? These bitches nowadays’d have a nigga dick drippin’ lava


You know what I’m sayin’? Ayyo, these bitches’ll have a nigga, give a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin’ man

Okay…

Man fuckin’ with these hoes without a rubber nowadays is like bungee jumpin’ with a rope around your neck. That’s like playin’, that’s like playin’ Russian roulette with a shotgun. Ayyo word, ayyo, ayyo man, fuck a rubber man, I’m a start puttin’ balloons on my dick, dog, ayyo I’m a start puttin’ suntan lotion on my dick or somethin’. Ayyo these bitches is triflin’ dog

Oh man these hoes is triflin'

Ay I’m gettin’ the fuck up out of here man

I stay jeweled up pockets swelled up
From banks I held up, plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet, when I hold heat, we roll deep
In a triple-black dark-tinted OG
I catch a fag 3 o lock in the mon'
On the block all alone, then put a Glock to his dome
Tell him give it up quick, you nitwit, dont try to get slick
Or I'mma let this four-fifth spit, and leave your shit split
Prick, it ain't nothin decent about me
A true thug for real
, you can ask the 
precinct about me
A rap junkie, dont try to play like some flunky
Jewels be chunky, pockets lumpy, attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be frontin a lot
Popping mad shit, trying to be something they not
Your faggot ass better stay to dancing, don't even look at me
I might break your jaw just for glancing,

Yo while we hold gats, you hold knifes
When you sold 8's, we sold pies
When you rode bikes, we drove 5's
It's no comparison son, it's just embarrisin'
Im runnin' with some of the baddest niggas in the whole New York
We hold the fort, y'all bitch niggas is holdin' dicks
Playa hatin' pushin' stolen whips
We at the dice game rollin' tricks
OT, throwin bricks, takin' ova
Cookin' up coke with baking soda
Yeah, you better spread with them 30 dollar kicks on
Or get whipped on, knocked out cold and pissed on

You the type that go to jail for a petty capor
Then come home on good behaviour

Go ahead and front so I can try this right hand out
Across your jaw, L never losed a war
No respect for them faggots who enfore the law
You got suttin' to say cough it out
Cause niggas be wanted beef
But when you pull out the heat they ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about, you was just frontin'
Now it ain't nuttin', ain't that suttin'
I should start bustin' anyway and put one of you punks in the ground
Y'all niggas be killin' me with y'all faces around, jumpin' around

’97 DJ Clue Freestyle,The Danger Zone,2011,"I drop hot rhymes
Take it hot '97slot time
I shine like a icon
Hund' Thirty-Ninth, don
V12 600 gas put my Nike on
Put a mic on
Put it piped on
Strong armed like 'Nam
Desert storm never fight calm
Four-fifths shook my right arm
Pearl white palm
Murder your life on
Make more noise than a night storm
Heavy artillery, hand grenades, and pipe bombs
Like Tron
Man there's no telling who I might harm
Time Wall Street business men in their white pawn
It's like on
Bullet holes buck fifty life longs
Fight strong, Don Juan, ill trife con
Write hype shit, my gang can make a dyke like dick
And my crew bigger than your crew twice as thick
Niggas be lookin' for some ice to stick
Nice and slick
And pipe the dick
And all the bad righteous chicks
My niggas locked up, we light them flicks
Send you commissary all types of kicks
My man L got 25 to life taught me life's a bitch
Said hold your head 'Gruff son and write them hits

Ya'll niggas like to stress them hoes
Impress them hoes
And spend money to dress them hoes
I sex them hoes and send them home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone I'm rubbered-up 'case the bitch full blown
The other night around 8PM
Pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the grey B.M
Went to the ATM
Took a thou' out
Later on had to wil' out
In the club knocked some nigga and his pal out
Afterwards went to the restroom and pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' what bitch number I can dial out
Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady, that's ill
Playa hatas be givin me harsh looks
But I'm trying to sell records like Garth Brooks
So fuck 'em all
When it's cold I throw the skully on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal bitch I guess it's Pérignon
If the pussy hole to tight I throw some jelly on
Try to tax, watch the 9 mil' burst
I've been off the scene over two years and niggas is still thirst
To hear Big L drop an ill verse
All you unsigned niggas that wanna battle, get a deal first
I sport the bullet-proof fitted hat
That attitude you better get rid of that
Where ever you floss is where you gonna get it at
I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin' figgas while you broke niggas keepin' it real
L is rap most livest cat
I'm getting stacks while you askin' niggas - ""Do you want fries with that?""
I rob fags in the stair case
No mask, bare face
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes?
No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the O.J. Trial

Yo, I rhyme with my heart and my soul
Shine like a carton of gold
Got M.C.'s startin' to fold
Leave 'em cold
Better play their part and their role
Leave 'em shook like a hustler with knocks on the stroll
What you know about slangin' in the park in the cold
Puffin buddha with your buddies
Gooses and the skullies
Rockin' Tim' boots and all the honeys
And when it's sunny
We sport linen spending money
Of course we some men who hungry
Society forced us to attend to ugly
And scorin' like Bugsy
I rather die than keep the feds cumfy
I read Nicky Barnes
 yeah plus I read Bumpy
Harlem World's where I'm from see
Picture 'Gruff comin' clumsy
I'm from the home of the money maker bum is junkie
DJ Clue pull up something funky
I'm kinda of tired off this weed and this Brass Monkey

Uh
Ears studded out
Playa hatas cut it out
Chain flooded out
Sexin' hoes tell I'm nutted out
You on the mixtape, talkin 'bout you flip weight
You fishcake holdin' your dick and still couldn't piss straight
I got heavy dough
And that's something that you already know
Clue heard me once and said ""I bet he blow""
I rock the Presi' Rol'
You want beef let me know
I be in Mexico chillin' with a sexy ho
How cool can one MC be?
Ya'll still envy me cause I'm M.V.P
Cruise through Harlem in a bullet-proof MPV
Man, you fuck around and get plugged like MTV
I'm a pretty pimp with mad gear
I put my hoes on the moon if there was cash there

Yo, I'm mad vexed, give me your address
And I'll deliver, stand and watch you shiver
As the bullets travel through your liver
This nigga bloodshed is mad rough
Battling me is like jumping inside a river while you're handcuffed
My fist is more nastier than Travel Fox
My silhouette inside intensive care, because I like to shadowbox
My gat makes more noise then Roman candles
I stay in murder scandles, and dust the fingerprints of burner handles
And I left Jehovah slain, I don't cry over pain
Cause I puff fat dimes of novacaine
Murder astrologist, mad cases of manslaughter
I rape this man's daughter, then put the shit on cam corder
Put it for sale on 2-5th and 8th
Her pops tried to flex and bass, then the tech correct
And spit in his face, her brother dice tried to get shiest
So I took his life, with a knife, then asked him twice about his fucking son and wife
After that, I load the gat and let the lead start flying
That shit is death defying, now you need dental records to identify him
I had beef with this Priest his name was father Clyde
This how he died, I had seven put on his side, and fulled him with formaldehyde
I get more high then frequencies, no one gets ass deep as me
Your worst nightmare, don't sleep on me
(Chorus)
""It ain't where you're form it's where you at"" - Rakim
So when you walk through Harlem faggot watch your back
""It ain't where you're from it's where you at"" - Rakim
So when you walk through Harlem faggot watch your back

Yo, I'm a cat with 9 live, but everyday I risk them
Pop shots the Glock at the cop and missed him now he's all up in the system
Upstate, buying for crime, slaving the time
My mother down here praying for mine
Cause I'm like Snider, living one day at a time
Harlem's a rough route, get snuffed out in a tough bout
The streets is full of smoking guns from people getting puffed out
I scrap them like a sculpture, living out my fucking culture
My crews a bunch of vultures with the .38s and holsters
And I quick to hurt a fool, cause money got that murder pull
And don't leave my house without the guns, mask and surgicals
Don't tell me how I act and sound, I pack a mack and pound
And strap them down to clap them clowns, I never seen a cap and gown
And I'm a basketcase, I'll bash your face, and blast your waist
In a casket trace, cause me and this bastard Mase, drop at a tragic place
Cause uptown it ain't nothing sweet, it's just guns a grief
Tons of beef, and little niggas run the streets
And pop the boots for lots of loot
Even sell a cop a deuce, on top of roofs
But be careful cause the Glocks is loose
And I'ma choke you like a capsule, niggas wanna scrap? Boat
And I'ma end the shit on that note
(Chorus)
""It ain't where you're form it's where you at"" - Rakim
So when you walk through Harlem faggot watch your back
""It ain't where you're from it's where you at"" - Rakim
So when you walk through Harlem faggot watch your back

I'm known for drawing guns with speed, and selling tons of weed
Cause I got sons to feed
And it's a must that I commence to slain
Any faggot MC that goes against the grain
And I'ma smoke Pataki's ass and Rudolph Giuli' like a Woolie
Keep a toolie for any moolie who act fooley
So if a nigga disrespect L, to hell is where I'm send them
After I skin him, And spit some venenom in him
Run with introduers, looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddah and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
Beat niggas with lead pipes, leave trails of dead mics
Cause where I'm from niggas jewels get run like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided, crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules the thugs created

’92 Rock N. Wills Audition,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ayyo, I got the gift of gab
To lift and grab, the mic
And recite hype rhymes
That'll rip and rag, and drag
A fag MC, who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot, talkin' about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle troop
Rhymes I hook up, MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust and dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack
Cause I got 'em down pat
Your rulin' time is over
So gimme your crown jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get wit' me hops
That's why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rappin' fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin' out, but that's cool
Cause I'm the principal of the new school

Yeah, aight, check it out
I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot, props I got a whole lot
Cause wit' a pen and some paper this man makes
Rhymes that're so damn great, with flavor like pancakes
I'm kickin' rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall, MCs take a big fall
For tryin' to get with this, I'm too swift with this
A microphone murderer full with magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own poems or get your dome flown
Or put in a boot camp, L is the new champ
I'm not the type to go out like a food stamp
I'm throwin' rhymes like a pitcher throws a curve ball
And I'm a serve all punks that try to brawl
So stop sleepin' on me, don't even doze hops
Or I'm a heat you up and eat you up like Stove Top
Stuffin', I'm bum rushin', shorts I'm takin' none
My rhymes weigh a ton, I'm not fakin' son
You're the one who's fakin', tryin' to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit, tell you the truth, you should quit
Rappin', start snappin', cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo I overthrow ya and have ya screamin' like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup o' Coca-Cola
I'm goin' through MCs like a ransack
Stand back, as I cruise smooth like a Am-Trak
Your rhymes are rusty g, you can't fuck with me
That's why you're hidin' in protective custody
L's not the one and I keep MCs runnin'
I hurt 'em like bunions, make 'em cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter and I'm brighter than Einstein
Try to bite my lines and you'll get a size nine
Foot put in your ass for bein' a crook
Hit with a vital hook and get your title took
Yeah, I'm a pass it to my man

Now check it out, I'm a get paid for the nineteen nineties
I don't care who likes me or who stands behind me
The man to peep, far from weak so don't sleep
From stage to streets I still go one deep
So save that off the wall bullshit, ya get had son
Fuck around, grab the mic and catch a bad one
I come correct and strapped to bust a ill rap
Me take a loss to who? Ya oughta kill that
Back up, slack up, give a brother some head room
Hype on the mic, amazin' in the bedroom
Girls like me cause I'm straight and don't sidestep
I do shit Jack LaLanne ain't tried yet
Ask any female, bet you she'll say I'm good
That's why I'm Finesse, porn star of the neighborhood
Yeah, cause I kick slicker raps
It's Lord Finesse, so bow and tip your hat
And make way cause I get plenty say
And those who don't like me I don't give a shit anyway
Cause when it comes to lyrics I always find somethin'
That make brothers press the rewind button
I'm a get mine, tell me what you're gonna do?
Cause ya couldn't see me if ya wanted to
Get who you want, shit you could call the cops
But for now, I'm gettin' all my props
I reign terror, whatever's clever
I'm cooler than The Mack and Shaft put together
So chill, don't try to get ill dummy
Me get stomped by who? Be for real, money
I'm not havin' it so go on and get your best group
You'll see why they call me Lord Finesse, troop
I eat 'em like sandwiches, send 'em home in bandages
Gimme that mic, I'll show you what doin' damage is
Nice, swift and deeper than quicksand
I'm takin' out opponents like a hit man
I get the crowd hype like a sorta drug
It's Lord Finesse, who the fuck you thought it was?
I lounge and chill but still could get ill
I'm live and real with skill beyond skill
Pull girls like a lasso, keep the crazy cash flow
A nigga beat me on the mic? Don't be an asshole
I'm indestructible so bring in a substitute
What's up with a battle? Yo I can't fuck with you

I'm intellectual, gettin' the best of you
I eat MCs like the food at a festival
Drop science and math; stand tall like a giraffe
Completin' the…task, breakin' rappers in half
Puttin' suckers out of it, yeah I talk a lot of shit
But when it comes to rhymes I deserve a fuckin' scholarship
Won't front or perp the role, I get the most of hoes
I'm so cool, I've got pussy on remote control
Whether you're a virgin or a bad lookin' hot sister
I'm baggin' up bitches like a shoplifter
So Lord Finesse is not the one to fool
I was gettin' sex since they first invented Underoos
So set it off, no time to rehearse the rappin'
It's Lord Finesse, so prepare for the worst to happen
Mics get ripped up, good times get tucked
Throw your hands in the air, suckers keep your lips shut
Cause ya'll wanna waste time sayin' them fake rhymes
Gimme my respect and props or I'm a take mine
Cause I ain't nothin' to play with
And fuckin' with me ya need more than a first aid kit
So it's better that ya chill and max with me
I'm sendin' out warnin's quicker than a fax machine
I get funky and kick it so let's get wit' it
Opponents who think they can hang, y'all can forget it
I sit and write rhymes, makin' up hype lines
Achievin' shit you couldn't do in a lifetime
So don't care me and compare me to those other brothers
I'm Lord Finesse and I'm one bad ass muthafucker
I'm doin' MCs as ya hire 'em
Bustin' they ass and make 'em sign up for retirement
Without doubt I'm a brother with all the clout
Whoever said I'm whack, what the fuck is they talkin' about?
Yeah, you don't stop, so L, my man my brother
Tear shit up you bad muthafucker

Yo I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for bustin' mad caps
I was in rag tracks with rhymes that backslap
'Causin' a nightmare, I don't fight fair
Niggas playin' hard rock, hopin' they might scare
The B-I-G-L but I'm not to be fucked wit'
You're tryin' to take your idol's title?
You on some bugged shit
I keep the women fiendin' and screamin' for my smooth shit
My rhymes are mad thick and yours is thin as a pool stick
Fuck it, bust it, I like it rough and rugged
Your style is wick whack and played out like nugget
Bracelets, face this, you can't erase this, escape this
Break this, take this, cause I bake this
I get so loose on beats that I produce
Niggas be frontin' crazy hard and got no juice
They softer than paper plates, the lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf and a Erasermate
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Mics I wreck and fry, rappers I petrify
Pack a fo' fif' with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now you're locked in a box, dead, with no props
I'm not jokin', there's no time for snappin'
Niggas that be yappin', I'm puttin' caps in
So base up or get sprayed up to the waist up
You'll get found faced up, police can't trace up
Fingerprints, why? Because I leave no evidence

Wit tracks that'll make you cry, hate you die
Stop frontin, you got no dough, might a had, but not no mo'
You mad cuz I knocked yo' ho
While cops watch me, I got cats that watch po-po
My block loco, don't need a crew I rock solo (what)
Or wit my nigga Gruff
These faggot niggas ain't as rich as us
I need chicks to lust, smoke my weed mixed wit dust
Go ahead and let your crew soup you up
In the ambulance, gon' have to come and scoop you up
Fuck wit my last soul, my new shit is goin past gold
And if you don't agree, you's a asshole
Mark my word, you gon' make me pump the bird
And spark this herb, 'til homicide chomp the curb, ya heard?
I never hesitate to bust my gun
Harlem World, y'all know where the fuck I'm from

The game of life, got ups and downs, downs and ups
Kingpin cats lose they crowns in cuffs
Some get murdered, some get shot (boaw boaw boaw)
So lay on, nigga her-oin, cocaine, pot it don't stop
Rise to the top, nigga stop despisin my pops
Yeah I rap, but still got them pies on the block
Bitches lookin at the size of my rocks, size of my knotts
Keep a stash box, ride wit them Glocks
Smoke 'dro, fuck po-po, fly from the cops

Die by the gun, thou shall come but for now have fun
Fuck bitches, party, Cristal on my tongue
Violence is young, wild as they come
Catch me in Harlem World smokin silence wit sons, what
Aiyyo cats wanna talk trash, yo I talk cash
And take it, make they ass get naked
It's a stickup (get on the floor),y'all niggas crash the pavement
Pass yo' chains, pass yo' Rollies, pass yo' bracelets
Or feel them hollow laced tips nigga
I spray clips at the punks that be runnin they lips
Not gunnin they bitch, gunnin them
Squeeze off, don't miss none of them
Shoot po-po right in front on them
Double-M, goddamn niggas shouldn't have fucked wit him
Y'all niggas sufferin, I'm thug hustlin

Tied your monkey-ass up, took the bucks and the raw
Nigga what, yeah Harlem World, Big L, Herb McGruff
Nigga holdin it down, 9-8 shit, fuck that, word up

Aiyyo holy war, chrome four-four
Twelve shots call, I came deep
One-hundred-one wolves at your front door
Mouths foamin, rubber grips laid on my hip
Cock it and spit, slit his whole shit, empty the whole clip
Pretty kid, broke a few ribs, did a murder bid
Four-five, got hit wit two more, then the god slid
Why try, watched men die, let the slugs fly
Stay high, I'm from the streets Murderville, NY
I told y'all I was comin, niggas thought I was frontin
I want it all, in nine-bill I'm sayin something
MC's petro, me lose hell no, you're wet no
My verbal techno, spit it for dire out the Expo
Me and D-O, on the lee-low, lay low
Call Grago, Boriquas call em Flaco
The latest Timb's, I got those
Burn that ass like tobassco, you know my name
Hot hell, Fidel Castro, ask no
Questions, fuck you and your weapon
You're pussy, your gun ain't went off since '87
My Mac-11 shot thirty-three in your direction
Where I come from, bums bust guns, what you expected
Well connected, from the slums where life's hectic
Niggas starvin, need paper, jackal's is desparate
Aiyyo movin like Israeli, sippin Henny in Bentley's
Got a deal now, I'm signed what the fuck can you tell me
What, Murderville, all square beware
Hot-hell nigga tortured

Ha, listen closely, to how C.L.'s focus be
Who wrote me, a diamond-gold ball rosary
Had supposedly, tarnished his name and status
Draw the fastest, force him go to the mattress
Imagine this, in my technique's
This swervin authentic version M.D. Mount. to Vernon
Touchin anybody like that lime in Bacardi
To whippin all the watercrafts down in Yardie
Half-steppin, hardly make it son, perfectly clear

The buck stops here, ain't a damn thing funny
Barbershop niggas always bad-mouthin money

Hearin cats talk about me like a chick
They gotta be sick, ad-libbing we singin
Went from day one over there we bring it
Or scrap like hockey, cock-ing, blow it ?a-key?
The poss-e, car shows under the marquee
Dressed up, caked out, and vest up
Better rest up, pop bottles till I'm messed up
Paper chase, play clubs like a vacation
On occasion, politicin my situation
Every broad care, what he drive, what he wear
Wit a bonier whisperin the shit in my ear
Yeah, the bombshell, trapped in the Caramel
Get the parcel, iced down the cartel
Knowin C.L.,do know you mack slow
Bitches act though, bigger niggas call me Fatso
Heavy-weight, regulate the tri-state

I keep a stash full of cash, puffing grass with a dash of some hash
Jeans be saggin' off half of my ass
I keep it ghetto, still, I'm a fly fellow
I love the cuties, no matter if they dark-skin or high yellow
My iceberg sweaters and leathers are raw
I'm getting cheddar galore like never before
I can pull a dime quicker than Dillinger can pull a heist
I rock the blue face presidential for the ice (
Woo!
)
Me and my crew is sick like the flu
So what you gon' do, boo, when we come for you, huh?
It ain't no calling time out once I climb out the garbage can
Get two nines out, and blow your spine out

How could you call yourself MC?
If you from the hood, I know you feel me
How could you call yourself MC?
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned

Ayo, my whole entourage is large from here to Vegas
Imitators hate us 'cause we sport gators and flavors
Put snitches in boxes, coppers and federals watch us
They tried everything in this world to lock us but can't stop us
I'm known for rockin' tours, picture me moppin' floors
Only fuck with ki's and not the kind that be lockin' doors
What I recite be takin' hours to write
So if you bite, just tell your man what kind of flowers you like
I be that buck wild, foul criminal who make the women smile
It's time to drop something new, it's been a while
And L is that nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time, my parents haven't met yet

How could you call yourself MC?

One shot in ya butt, my guns never tucked
Don't want a slut, finessed by the art of the cut

Feds wanna challenge us
Off balance with silencers, locked up for calenders
Made men reversed my life, started again
Gone in the wind, respect niggas rhyming ten
Stuck on the grind, with two nines hugging ya spine
Addicted to crime, new car sitting on two dimes
With two dime, New York niggas, we love shine
Whether it's yours or mine by the night yours is mine
That's shilling week anyway, fuck it, it's more shine
I'm 24, your part time you ain't killing niggas
Walking round and grilling niggas
Acting like we ain't feeling niggas
Pop bottle, roll with gorillas and breed drug dealers
North, South, East to West ya'll gonna feel us

Keep fronting like you'se a thug and get your dome pushed back
Coz you don't get down that tough shit you talk is profound
You'se a clown
Fuck around, come up town and get found
I keep a pocket full, none of you niggas can touch my funds
I don't fight no more all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed i'm squeezin' Macs busting off caps
Those coward cats with all their platinum plaques get taxed
And I do Jooks, and slang Pies to make cream rise
It's all about these green guys, front your whole team dies
How I'm. Living so far? Swell you can't scar L
Headed to cartel, selling more cakes than carvel
And I'm labeled a kind thug, police got my line bugged
Hope I see the grave from old age and not a nine slug
I'm quick to bust a mean nut in some teen slut

We quick reachers, spear with the fearless til you drip liters
Flip divas, them chicks, eager to strip to they tits and beaver
Sip Cris' and sniff coke off the beater
Yeah we ball big baby, look off the meter
You should see us, it's movie star status
Scar lackers lost cabbage, drip the Pablo Escobar fabrics
Froze the road we chose, not a pretty route, let it out
Grimey and grittied out, stack dough, jiggy out
Dime bitches behavin like ya sex slave skizzied out
Some nigga dizzy south, til he's out, busy mouth
Swerve to the curb, hit the bird split the kitties out
We kidnap for trap blackmail for a gang a mill
Spot banger himself, fishscale rocks under the fingernails
The blood trail lead to a corpse
Treat my appetite for greed with a torch
For keys to a Porsche, to breeze in the loft
Roll up my hand sheets with the force
We squeeze off, no need for remorse, playa
Forty wild goons, we forty Calhouns
You die forty foul dooms for forty coward moves
Bless sparkle, and spark until my shorty style rules
Giancanna dead? Widespread, I'll be a 40 mile tune baby

I left em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'mma squeeze the gat and pop 10 out

Now I'm icey, I ain't gotta say one word, you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit, hate to be around that shit
You don't know me, just say whatsup, gimme a pound, that's it

I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale

I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch – if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Ayo, crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L

98' Halftime Radio,The Danger Zone,2011,"Ya'll cats like to stress them chicks, impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks, I sex them chicks
And send them home, Corleone known to be stoned
When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm, pockets crazy slim
Jumped out the gray bm, went to the atm
Took a thou' out and later on I had to wild out
In da club knock some kid and his pal out
Afterwards, went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin' what chick number I can dial out
Cuz its L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes then that sprint lady, and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks, but I'm tryina sell records like Garth Brooks
So F em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips, keep my celly on, mega ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo, I guess its Perignon
If the nana's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
I've been off the scene over 2 years, and cats is still thirst
They hear Big L drop an ill verse, so all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first
I sport da bulletproof, fitted-hat, that attitude you betta get rid of that
Whereava u floss is where u gon get it at
What, stay strapped, go to sleep wit my steel
Makin figures while u broke cats is keepin it real
L is raps most livest cat, gettin stacks while u askin people ""do u want fries with that""?
I rob fags in da staircase, no mask, bare face
The one police wouldn't dare chase, keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without cash? No way pal
Word up, my money longer than the OJ trial
Yo while we hold gats, you hold knives
When you sold 8's, we sold pies
When you rode bikes, we drove 5's
There's no comparison son, it's just embarrasing
I'm runnin with some of the baddest men in the whole New York
We hold the fort while you crap cats is holdin
Playa hatin, pushin stolen whips
We at the dice game rollin trips, out of town throwin bricks
Takin over, cookin up coke with baking soda
I buy hot jewels and ice it down, while you go to the jewelry store with short doe tryna bring the prices down
You better spread with them 30 dollar kicks on
Or get whipped on, knocked out cold, and pissed on
L is a heavyweighter with steady paper
You the type to go to jail for a petty caper
Then come home on good behavior
Talkin bout you no longa hard now cuz you a man of God now
Yo it's amazin, L is blazin, always been
Before I put the braids in, I use to let the waves spin
What you be sayin don't impress me at all
Them chicks you be jayin donit be sexy at all
Word life, to everything that I recite stand out
Go head and front so I can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw, L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce the law
You got sumthin to say, then cough it out
Cuz cats be wantin beef, but when you pull out the heat
They ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about, you was just fronting now it ain't nuthin
Ain't that sumthin, I should start bussin anyway
Put one of you punks in the ground
Ya'll cats be killin me with ya'll faces frown, jumpin around
Like you scared of L, not even, cuz imma be a thug until I stop breathin
Plus I'm runnin' with a real smooth crew that'll shoot at you
You wanna knuckle up, whateva, we can do that too",https://genius.com/Big-l-98-halftime-radio-lyrics

It's the Big L, and we gon' do a lil summin' like this
So check it out yo
Aiyyo, knock, knock

Guess who

Bloodshed to your rescue
I'm rougher than the projects that niggas don't walk next to
My mental, sense is drenched from the Beck's brew
Eyes chinky like an oriental; far from gentle

You'd rather douche B, before you mush me
Or even push me black, in fact I call you Cujo, B
Cause all y'all some pussy cats
Give me the gun, and watch this trooper spark it, I maneuver targets
Cause I be packing like the minions in the supermarkets

Yo, my style is mastered, blunts; never pass it
Stay blasted, Jurrasic type cash up the ass split
I'm mad sick, when shit get hectic, I wet shit
When my TEC spit, it's redruM cause I'm dyslexic
Out of my crew I am the loc'est one, so don't provoke the strung
Or my smoking gun'll leave you soaking son
I speak the truth, so you should all figure
My double four trigger's +Above The Law+ like that Seagal nigga
And I'm a buddah head until I'm dead
It ain't no changin' Bloodshed
Tough bread, enough said

Aiyyo, check it out
It ain't no fools in rappin
Nigga play me, pull out the tool and clap him
I don't care if the kid's quadruple platinum
My peeps ain't cheap, they deal coke
And when my steel smokes, you will choke
You feel dope? You won a hundred battles, and you still broke
You a joke loc, nothin' but a slow poke
Your ass couldn't paddle in a row boat, you know ho
Let me tell you a few things, don't care who your crew brings
Cause when my trey-deuce sings, you'll get laced up like shoestrings
Nobody can touch my rhythm
My brother Hud'll get 'em, and I bring Blood to victims
When they get stuck like stick 'ems

Aiyyo, my crew never fights fair
(SO DON'T SLEEP MUTHAFUCKAS)
Cause it's your worse nightmare

Aiyyo, this kiko will dismantle cancers
Handle dancers, voodoo do y'all Kangol dancers
Handle wraths, get put inside ambulances
My gat'll screech each adder scenes, now up in magazines
Heavy D fucked up my black, coffee got to have that cream

Check it, yo move
Mics I be tearing them, from here to Maryland
I'm known to bury men, and drug mics with more dope than heroin
I clear the block like one time, plus street sweepers combined
My gun rhymes make niggas wonder why I'm still unsigned

And never see me run, believe me hun
It ain't no freebees sons, go out with BB guns
Then niggas say, ""Can we be chums?""

You must've went to the Wizard and got some heart
To fuck with Bloodshed because I spark with mints in the dark

Yeah, and I'm the 'nnihilator
You couldn't figure out with a calculator
You sweet like candy, eat you Now and Later

I extort dough like broken phones
I'm on my smoking bones, and tokin' chromes
To have you croaking with soaking domes

Yeah, and bitches see me, they run double-fast
They got trouble? Laugh
Cause I make niggas' mouth foam up like a bubblebath

On my block, niggas get licked quick
My man Caroni got his wig split
He could've signed, but had no time for legit shit

You play like punk rock, I catch wreck when the funk drop
You a chump hops, and I stunt cops, whenever I let my trunk pop
And devour turbans, who this coward hurtin'?
See me every hour flirting, with a nine to wet niggas up like shower curtains

That goes to all the niggas faking the Jacks
I be like Jason, racing through your block with a axe
And I be chasin', til I meet your crew face to face and
The first nigga basin', I'm wastin', closed casin' nigga

Aiyyo, my crew never fights fair
(SO DON'T SLEEP MUTHAFUCKAS)
Cause it's your worse nightmare

Word up, the Children of the Corn is puttin' it on from now on

I want bricks so thick, you cut em with machetes
Any nigga met me know I'm bout gettin cheddy
Ain't nothin fancy, settle for 1500 chevy
I watched my man get banned tryin to plan scams
Done ran grams on a pan am to san fran
We want the money, so it's a must we get paid
I puff in the shade, rock clothes custom-made
Send bricks to papi, be big as liberacce
You don't believe me? nigga, watch me
Unfold your phone and call up all your soldiers at home
Tell em you saw mase in rolling stone holdin a chrome
Now he probably out in a poconos strokin hoes
Smokin those, celebratin, open the mo? s
A cool guy, even a cool guy can't get too high
Even his boo'll try to set him for his moolah

This little menace be guzzlin hennessy
Props from here to tennessee, police wanna finish me
You know I hate jakes, they mad cause I make papes
I'm large like the great lakes, with drug spots in 8 states
Chillin, makin sure this money is right
Sippin sunny delite, hittin every honey in sight
Playboy, tracks I like rough, ain't that right, gruff?
I might puff some green shit, but no white stuff
I shoot the gift like a quick fix, front and get your shit stitched
I drop slick hits (go l) get off my dick, bitch
When I was broke, you ain't wanna see me get rich
Now I kill tracks and flip bricks and murder nitwits
And I'm all about big bankrolls, clothes and hostin shows
Smokin foes and strokin hoes in the Poconos
Without cash you ain't meant to live
Signin out corleone, the uptown representative
Hey yo, gruff, man
This is yo track, man
What you waitin for?
Rip this shit

Now my life somethin finer, it wasn't when I was a minor
See, but now I'm pumpin china
White, nigga, yeah, right out the diner
For this shit here I could get time in either
Facility, locked up where all the villains be
Make your first move if you're bored of grillin me
From harlem world, take care of your mob and your girl
Too much dom, gruff can't starve in this world
.38 revolve with the pearl
My wolves hollerin at the moon as the earth revolve in a twirl
Blood thirst, nigga with dough get rushed first
Get him, a thug search, tell him these slugs hurt
Do you in, hooligans, timbs and rough shirts
Bust jerks, better duck when gruff squirts
Leave niggas in more pain than when your nuts hurt
Give niggas the business, done-done much dirt
Alright, alright
You see what I'm talkin about?
That's what I'm talkin about
Who started this?

Who made this?

It's a fact I stay geared it shouldn't be weird
That I'm feared, cuz my raps are rougher than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm Def like Jef, right to left
My raps are badder than mornin breath
For niggas deaths I'm the number one suspect
Cuz I catch much wreck, 'specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stiggedy star
Breakin 'em up and then takin they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin the microphones
Apart
I hold a 40 right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic, niggas be like, ""Shorty hype!""
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics is well writ'
You sayin L's dis and L's dat, get off L dick
Rhymes I create and knock out ya gold tooth
Battlin me's like fightin a gorilla in a phone booth
I wreck mics and drop the cool speeches
Nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin school teachers
1-2, 1-2, Rappers I run through
Fuck Karate, I practice Gun-Fu
The Big L is an assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a fag leakin like Activator
I'm the nigga that you never even thought of beatin
Black, white, or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each an'

From OB to QB my war rest in peace to bandit
Take a chance to this game of life

Everywhere we go, we must bring toast forever
Popping the chrome, always dropping a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is how I'm gonna give it to you, Big L style
They brought it back to the streets cause that shit sell now
So pal back up a bit, give me elbow space
I represent Harlem World
, 
not Melrose Place
So I'm a lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyent is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop fronting cause I might get vexed
And I'm a run up on y'all and slice y'all necks
With the machete, pockets heavy, slang more

Yo, check it out, this that Sandman 118 shit
And it's the B-I-G-L, straight from 139 in fucking Lenox
Harlem, the danger zone, I gotta represent it
Somebody gotta do it, you know what I'm sayin'?
Ayo, I got a new single out, It's called ""M.V.P.""

My clique is quick to put a bullet in a strangers dome
You should of known not roam through the danger zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest, in a slug fest
We sendin' faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums of greed
Known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed 'cause I got sons to feed
And it's a must that my toast smokes
I'm not like most folks
Fuck 10's and 20's, I carry ghost notes
And it's a must that I commence to slayin'
Any faggot emcee who goes against the grain
I'ma smoke Pataki ass and Rudolph Giuli like a wooly
I keep a tooly for any mooly who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L, to hell is where I'ma send him
After I skin him and spit some venom in him
I run with intruders, looters and sharp shooters
Who spark buters and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
Yo, I'm that nigga that be jumpin' on your stereo
When I walk the streets, your bitches tappin' they friends like, ""There he go""
Never had rules to follow, none of my jewels are hollow
Try to tax mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
'Cause I was never the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games, I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out with suicidal thoughts
All my life I've been a lady bruiser
A wrong chooser, school refuser
Drug abuser, born loser
Clothes bummy, nose runny, it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now  me and the devil are on the same team
I'm a hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I'm better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward, and frontin' on me, I won't allow it
I'm high-powered, fuckin' freak bitches like 
Nadina Howard
Front and get your belly torn, I keep a Peli on
I'm fuckin' with Grey Poupon and Dom Pérignon
On the ave with punk rocks
, 
quick to give a chump knocks
You ain't tough, the only thing you shootin' is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick, ugly bitches get the wrong number

And that's how we doin' it",https://genius.com/Big-l-sandman-118-lyrics

Calling to see how that joint, know what I'm sayin', came out
Hey yo fellas... Keep our eye open... watch out
Cause females be playing a whole lot of games like these
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
I know this lady by the name of Katie
If you broke, she's shady
You got cash? She's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death, well dressed
In Chanel, Guess, nothing less
Body got more curves than an S
I smoke her boots like Sess
And I confess the sex was the best (yes)
Within a week she had keys to my res
And then later my man Squeezer gave her gees to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Saying how she didn't like me, all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinking she was wifey, tricking ridiculous
Given her dues that was icey
I said it's over
And what I gave you, you can have that
It wasn't even her - it was myself I was mad at
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame, but it's a shame how I fell for the game
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
Aiyyo fellas, you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware
A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out, it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz SL
I asked honey her name, she replied, ""Monique""
Soft and sweet, from her head to feet, hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat, let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night, she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right - it's all good, so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home, and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child, I think that's quite foul
How is that? I wore a Lifestyle
So watch out fellas... Watch out
You better watch out fellas
Yeah, you better watch out
Watch out fellas... You better watch out
F'real
So watch out fellas... Watch out
You better watch out fellas

Go ahead and front, so I can try this right hand out
I'll cross your jaw, L never lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce the law
You got somethin' to say? Cough it out
Cause cats be wantin' beef, but when you pull out the heat, they ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about? You was just frontin'
Now it ain't nothin', ain't that somethin'?
I should start busting anyway, and put one of you punks in the ground
Y'all cats be killin' me with y'all faces round jumping around
Like you scarin' L, not even, word
Cause I'mma be a thug until I stop breathing
Plus I'm runnin' with a smooth crew that'll shoot at you
You wanna knuckle up then? We can do that too",https://genius.com/Big-l-88-hiphop-radio-freestyle-1998-lyrics

Fed Up Wit the Bullshit,UnKnown,UnKnown,"( VERSE 1 )
Yo, on the scene is the brother that's big, I'm not a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they ain't nothin but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights, and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop, or I'ma stop em, by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me, muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin life bids
Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip, cause I'm fed up with that bullshit
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up (Aw, shit)
( VERSE 2 )
Whether it's the hot, warm, cool or cold season
Pigs be fuckin with a nigga for no reason
You're just gettin home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up, and that's fucked up
This every day, not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other cheek
Or you'll be layin in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm only fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin
Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick
Cause I'm fed up with that bullshit",https://genius.com/Big-l-fed-up-wit-the-bullshit-lyrics
Audition,Return of the Devil’s Son,2010,"Yo. 1, 2, 1, 2. G'ahead, drop it
Yeah 1, 2, 1, 2. I go by the name of the Big L. Know what I'm saying?
Rock this for Rock N. Wills. Hardpack tape
A'ight. Goes like this
Ay yo. I've got the gift of gab
To lift and grab
The mic and recite hype rhymes
That'll rip and rag
And drag a fag MC
Who likes to nag a lot
And brag a lot
Talking about the lyrics that he has are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle, troop
Rhymes I hook up
MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust
And dust
And crushed
Bum rushed
And all of that
Rhymes never sound wack
Cause I've got them down packed
For you the time is over
So give me your crown Jack
I get hype fast
And MCs might last
A minute with me
Because their rhymes are light as
A feather and mine are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get with me, hops
That's why they all got taken out like a pizza box
The crown is still mine
Cause I kick ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rapping fiend
A lot of new jacks are coming out, but that's cool
Cause I'm the principal of the new school
A'ight. Check this out another joint like this
A'ight. Check it out
I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot
Props: I've got a whole lot
Cause with a pen and some paper this man made
Rhymes: they're so damn great
With flavor like pancakes
I'm kicking rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall
MCs take a big fall
For trying to get with this
I'm too swift for this
A microphone murderer form of magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own po'ms
Or get your dome blown
Or put in a boot camp
L's the new champ
I'm not the kind to go out like a Food Stamp
I'm throwing rhymes like a pitcher throws a curveball
And I'm a serve all
Punks that try to brawl
So stop sleeping on me
Don't even dose hops
Or I'm a heat you up
And eat you up
Like Stove Top
Stuffing
I'm bum rushing
Shorts: I'm taking none
My rhymes weigh a ton
I'm not faking son
You're the one whose faking, trying to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit
Tell you the truth: you should quit
Rapping
Start snappin
Cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo. I over throw ya
And have you screaming like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup of Coca Cola
I'm going though MCs like a ransack
Stand back
As I cruise
Smooth
Like an Amtrack
Your rhymes are rusty G
You can't fuck with me
That's why you're hiding in protective custody
L's not the one an'
I keep MCs runnin'
I hurt them like bunions
Make them cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter
And I'm brighter
Than Einstein
Try to bite my lines
And get a size nine
Foot
Put
In your ass for being a crook
Hit with a vital hook
And get your title took
Pass it to my man

Ha ha. ??? got flavour
Keep that flowing

I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for busting mad caps
I rip and rag tracks
With rhymes that back slap
Causing a nightmare
I dont fight fair

The B-I-G L, but im not to be fucked with
You're trying to take your idol's

You're on some buck shit

Face this
You can't erase this
Escape this
Break this
Take this
Cook or bake this
I get so loose
On beats that I produce
Niggas be fronting crazy hard and got no juice
They're softer than paper plates
The lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf
And an eraser mate
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Mics I wreck and fry
Rappers I petrify
Pack a four fifth with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now your locked in a box
Dead with no props
I'm not joking. There's no time for snapping
Niggas that be yapping
I'm putting caps in
So base up and sprayed up
From the waist up
You'll be found face up
Cops can't trace up

I’m tired of these punk niggas O
We gonna hit ‘em like this, check it out

Yo, while y'all standin’ on the corner, bummy and high
I'm out buyin’ the finest things money can buy
Cats frontin’ like they holdin’ but them crabs is broke
Chippin’ in for ten dollar bags o’ smoke
All on my back, because o’ the fame and the wealth
You male groupie, you oughta be ashamed o’ yaself
Plus I'm runnin’ with thugs who bust slugs at the heat
I be the MC who mad chicks be lovin’ to meet
And I'm not just a rapper, I got drugs on the street
I swear you never catch Corleone with Lugz on his feet
If you think I'm not as nice as whoever, then put your money up
Put your jewels up, whatever, put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up, punk, or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead, make a lotta bloodshed
Turn your tux red, far from broke, got enough bread
Mad hoes, ask Beavis, I get nothin’ but-head

Go all out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!

True indeed L, I hear these niggas talkin’ out their mouth slick
Mad ‘cause they bitches all on our dick
Peepin’ us out at the bar, checkin’ out what kind of champagne we sip
Jealous o’ the ice on my wrist
We pop Don and Cris’, no less
Hard pressed motherfuckers chippin’ in for White Star Moet
Chicken heads flock around us, thug niggas protect us
At the end o’ the night, all the hoes want to sex us
While y'all stand stagnated with blue balls
You face the song, ""You'll Never Find"" like Lou Rawls, shit
How the fuck a nigga with two good hands and feet
Be a bum and not survive in the streets?
Get your weight up, right now, we ain't promised later
Do what you gotta do to get them big headed papers
Even if it mean you and your team pullin’ a caper
Instead of going out like Pushead & Black, straight up

It's time to go all out, fuck it, get yours!
Stick and move wit' it, get yours! Get dough!
You only live once, Sky's the limit
I hope your ears are at attention y'all!

I keep cash, you couldn't pay me to rhyme if the beat trash
I stay bulletproofed up, Benz Coup-ed up
When it's cold, I rock the mink or I’m Triple Goose-d up

No doubt we're souped up, arrogant as fuck
Niggas can't touch what we holdin’ when it comes to the buck
I push the double R, ride through the city like a star
Dough bulgin’ out my pockets like my dick be hard

I gotta go see Poppi and snatch this brick up
But first I'm a smack this bitch up ‘cause she scratched my six up
I ain't the one to tax or stick up, cats get hit up
Frontin’ on me, y'all niggas got nothin’ on me

Yo, let's double the cream and stick Poppi and hold ‘em for ransom
Keep the bricks, sell 'em all, triple the pie and some
Kill two birds with one stone, get full blown
Tango and Cash, live niggas, Mush and Corleone

Go all out, fuck it, get yours!

Click-clack, let me get that
Make it quick black, skip the chit-chat

Want everything out your pockets coward, even the lint
You better not budge when I point the semi at you
What's that, a carat in your ear? Then give me that, too!
I'm like Death, you never know when I might pop up
In your hood and let the Glock buck and shoot your block up
Go ahead, call the cops, and I'll tear the cops up
Cause I don't give a hot fuck if I get locked up

What's this motherfuckin' rap game without L?

Yo, I'ma real wolf
That's why you always see my face in the hood
Others is phony, so they ain't safe in the hood
I'm from where the real hustlers pile dough
The home of rich Rich Porter, AZ, Alpo
Where they shoot dice and puff wild dro and talk fly
Throwin' game at every chickenhead bitch that walk by
That's how we live, everyday, all day
From one-one-o' to one-five-five, from first Ave. to Broadway
Harlem's soft? That's what they all say
Until they get murdered in broad day in a project hallway
You get cash, you get it your way
I get mines the fast and sure way: ski-mask and four-four way
Take some wolf to your crib and kick down your doorway
Go to the Hill, stick a aww yay for a brick of raw weigh
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him
Niggas don't want it with L, they be like: Anybody but him!

You frucker I'm like Bounty the quick to pick her up her
A bottle full of liquor that shit I can't get enough of
Don't let it happen again I understand much love
Next time Mark Ferman won't even find my gloves
Now you know better don't even wanna hold the grudge
Was it worth it? You found out too late I was the wrong person
Who ate while everybody was snatchin purses
You bait, cause every time I see you you nervous
You defeated your purpose now you seeing its worthless
I gotta aks myself what the fruck I was doin'
And I gotta aks myself who the fruck you was screwin'
I'm ready for anything, off the top of the head
I say anything, and I'mma get mines any means
I'm in the cream I'm in the weed
I'm in the position to take over
I know y'all cowards will leave
And if I get cut I know y'all cowards will bleed
Every second every minute every hour it's cheese
A bloody mess that's what I'mma leave what you expect?
The hungriest has gotta eat, and that's N-O-T-S
Complimentary ain't nothin for free a lot of men worry
Baggy jeans NOTS search tensery
My nigga L told me that a lot of men bury
And when we go to court we not on trial we jury

Back up off me baby let me see where it is
A one way ticket to nowhere with nothing to blow here
I want it all nigga from the chain to the money
If it's something here that you want
Then it's something here to die for

Put the mic down and fight now
That's up to you, I got no love for you or that counterfeit clown you with
I might let this this four pound spit and leave your crown split
Fuck you and fuck who you down with
Yo, I clap at you then clap at you gang with accurate aim
Blow off more than half of your brain for actin insane
You whack in this game I can see me now macking ya dame
Snappin' ya pockets and snatchin' ya chains
Shit I roll with cats that will attack in the rain
Be in the Benz or in the back of the train
Or the city bus, crones be hideous no-one I really trust
They call me Willie Hudge the way I mack these silly sluts
And right now I'm on top of the world
So when you see me comin through put a lock on ya girl
What


Everything is clear, I can see now, no longer seem now
Together we explode is lethal, we get stronger than re-clouds
And it's allergic I think I send niggas to turgis
We round up when it's urgin, four pound up and lurkin'
Big your whole town up in hearses
And it'll stay with you for like a thousand curses
All I want is more cream all I want is more weed
All I want is your cheese so we can throw the hands
Or we can show the cans but you still no man
I fear no man there's no chance
Just be ready for that last slow dance
Many come many run many gun
But there's no warrant to city run
Under the city son I pity none
And I still knock down these hoes until I'm 51

I Don’t Understand It (Demo Version),Rare Selections EP Vol. 3,UnKnown,"There are too many MCs who are overrated
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become an actor or a actress
Or a producer, ‘cause you fail to use the
Microphone right, so take flight before I bruise ya
For sayin’ them bull crap whack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
I'm serious as cancer, I'm not playin’ games
I should get foul and buckwild and start sayin’ names
But deep down inside
You know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And 
that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin’ platinum and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin’ down
Because it should be the other way around
I don't understand it
MCs, what's goin on?
I can't understand, man, how rappers col’ transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
And that's what you was known for, but not
No more
You changed and rearranged
You're not the same, your raps are plain
And that explains why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, but you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Who fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make dope tracks, jack, but now you're stone whack
So MCs, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same and only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Yo, go for yours like I'm goin for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dapper, stay dapper
And never try
To look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains but now they're wearin' beads?
I don't understand it
On the lyrical side, this is how it should be done
I'm not the one, my raps are stronger than rum
But some, MCs grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum, how come? Rap skills, they have none
And I wonder how the hell they get record sales
They raps are stale and frail
And forced like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak is weak
Got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, jack
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps are poor and whack and you went on tour with that
Crap, don't understand it, ‘cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin’ MCs nightmares
Rappers be frontin’ hard and rhymes they don't write theirs
But they still call themselves MCs?
Please, how could that be?

We Got This [Alternative Lyrics],The Archives 1996-2000 (Mixtape),1998.0,"I'm comin through ya'll, with the Glock buckin'
Your whole block duckin'
Every bitch that I'm fuckin' with now is cock suckin'
It's like I'm allergic to not fuckin'
Ya'll niggas is faggots like Rock Hudson
And Boy George
I destroy frauds with one verse
Nigga, we can knuckle up or we can let the guns burst
L is the type to murder your sons first
To get my point across
Since ya'll wanna chitty-chat with the coppers, ya'll might as well join the force
Where I'm from, believe me, snitches get killed
Niggas be hustlin' daily, tryin' to fuck more bitches than Wilt
Takin' pictures in silk, gator'd up
Passport dated up, hair braided up
I fucked your bitch, but I ain't rape the slut, she gave it up
I'm runnin' wit' Cheeks, he runnin wit' me
We runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together, but don't front
The guns is under the leather
Ready to ill, ready to kill, ready to peel
Steppin' to Corle, you betta be real
Cause none of my niggas be lettin' me chill
My crew be deliverin' hot lead, when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I been killin' up shit at rap events
It's like as soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin' the people yell
I'm rugged as hell, brothas can tell
That none of you niggas is fuckin' wit' L
When I'm that nigga you expect to catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parent's haven't met yet

Hittin' niggas with the real rap, remedy
Remember the real niggas from the NY
Me and my men high
Stay with cash, bring nothin' but the hotness
Ya'll niggas chill kid, we got this
Hittin' niggas with the remedy
Remember the real niggas from the NY

Yo, where I'm from, dudes get sliced
Cause crews is trife
And you might loose your life for your jewels and ice
I'ma slide to the 'tely and abuse your wife
If I got one rubber, I'ma use it twice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
When I rock gators, hoes be like ""Them shoes is nice!""
Dimes I'm willin' to hit, I stay drillin' a chick
They all know I ain't shit, but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I'll blast the TEC at your dome and leave you restin' alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of ses' 'til I'm gone
You got this nigga frontin' like he the main event
When his album ain't even last long, it came and went
I'm like Gotti to him, I throw the shotty to him
Niggas don't want it wit' L
They be like ""Anybody but him!""


We got this shit on lock

EZ Elpee Uptown Freestyle,UnKnown,1991.0,"Awww, yeah!
Yo, check it out. On the M-I-C, right about now is the B-I-G, period, capital L in effect! Word
And on the wheels o' steels, it's no other than, the EZ Elpee. Word
I wann' give a shout out to the whole one three nine crew
Herb McGruff, he's in the house, word up
Who else, who else? Lemme see... My man Antwon, he's in the house. Word up
Ayo, I can't forget D-Wiz, he's in the house. Word up
Who else? Ayo, uh, Tommy Rine, he's in the house, everybody in the house
But check it out, it go like this...

Yo it's the L and you can tell by my style and my light voice
You dig that I'm the youngest in charge, that's the right choice
I'm a MC that should be left alone, I'm bad to the bone
Flippin' and whippin' a rip and own the microphone
And taking me out, you know that's dead
Cause I got the rap biz sewed up like thread
In the rap game, I'm numero uno
Far from little, I'm bigger than a sumo
And rappers that pop shit, the Big L drop quick
I'm breaking niggas in half like a chopstick
Don't ever step to this, ""Why, L?""
Cause I'm the foul type
Throw up your hands and get floored with a wild right
I'm getting rid of emcees without a tussle, I don't hustle
And still pull bitches like a muscle
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well writ
You sayin' L's this and L's that, get off L's dick
I'm the toughest and roughest in the industry
Over the years my rap skills improved tremendously
Rhymes I recite, on the mic
Take flight, like a gear bike
Me get tooken out? Yeah right
Duck emcees at the mouth, they be poppin off
Talkin' about steppin' to the L, they need to knock it off
And slow the fuck down, before they get bucked down
I'm rolling with my strong crew, straight outta Uptown
When I'm in a rappin' mood, I grab the mic and get rude
Me gettin' booed? What the fuck, is you food?
You must be, or you're just plain dusty
Smoking PCP now you think you can crush me
But you'll get slayed, and get played, like ping pong
And I'll stomp that ass out flat, like i was King Kong
Rappers I ran past, but still many men ask
Cause I be gettin' loose, like a ho in a dance class
Raps are deadly and dangerous plus raw
Some rappers get props, but the L gets much more
Your rhymes are lightweight, mine's a heavy set
You're try'na get ill, you better chill cause you ain't ready yet
In rap battles I make rappers say ""I quit""
I drop metaphors, punchlines, all that fly shit
My heads you couldn't fly, diss me, you wouldn't try
I boast and brag a lot, but why shouldn't I?
Rappers that be basin, I'm wastin', without hesitation
Lyrics are so ill I had to put 'em on medication
Brothers be amazed, for days
The way L flow
Can other emcees fuck around? Hell no
Rhymes are extra ill, come on and test the skills
And you'll be the next fool who I'm next to kill
Believe me Chief, you don't want no trouble son
Try to call my bluff and you'll be calling nine double one
Emcees that act rude get chewed like Chattanooga
Quote what I wrote and get smoked like a bag of buddha
I never wear saggin' clothes, L be baggin' hoes
Bo Knows that I flows, and I'm draggin' those
Emcees that try to compete
Stop bein' cheap and spend ya papes and buy this dope ass tape

It's like that y'all and ya don't stop
The Big L gonna make your body rock
Peace, I'm out. Word up
Yeah. Word up, I'm comin' out soon
You can catch me on a Lord Finesse twelve inch, on the flipside. You know what I'm sayin'?

So don't be upset if I toss your girl
I got cheddar to blow, pockets never get low
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
I cruise in a GS Lex', Cartier specs
Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes, swingin like the Mets
Throwin' the dice and takin' all side bets

A little bro was born with the mind of a psycho
They first knew I was a crazy nigga
When my mother came home and found out I killed the
Baby-sitter
I did more crime in due time
Started my life of crime
About nine going out for mine
I made every little kid from my hood run
I was just like that little bastard from 
The Good Son
And my mind was past bummed
Dropped the blow-dryer in the water while my moms was in the
Bathtub
Then I just saluted as she electrocuted
They got booted, 'cause that's another I executed
I was a child runnin' wild like a goose chase
Punish my dad, I put poison in his toothpaste
Then I pick my aunt or sister up, gave her a quick spank
Then dropped the little bitch in a fish tank
I invited company, murdered the four guests
Put a cap in each whore chest and ate their raw flesh
I tell the truth I ain't lyin' man

When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus

And right now I got my cousin Brian' hand in a fryin' pan

In The Game,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's Flamboyant y'all
Yeah, yeah yeah, Corleone y'all
Me and my man was cruisin' through the streets
And everything was flowin' nice the corner's crowded
Niggas must be rollin' dice I parked the ride
So my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot and I'ma gamble
Until he come back, why not? Click-clack, cock the gat back
Gotta be strapped the game was mad packed
Mad cats pockets was fat
They playin' cee-lo, my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin' less than a G yo, you know my steelo
First I was losin' then I started throwin' head crack
After head crack, got my bread back, jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin' for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin' to plot, and I'm far from my block
Finally he walked out, told him, ""Hop the fuck in""
On my face he saw the grin and said, ""How much did you win?""
I estimated about, 45 maybe 50 G's
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone, headin' home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin' so I picked up the phone
Called Bones, I said, ""Yo son, I'm on the run need your help
Before I get done meet me downstairs, bring your big gun""
I don't believe this, this nigga said he can't make it
'Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked and then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut, what?
I'm cruisin' fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from, and his grimy crimey
It's about to get, real hasty grabbed the steel, took it off safety
'Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast, then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed, when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too, leakin' with a deep gash
I ain't panicked, I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm, so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him, shook my head then started buckin' my heat
It's over now, cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin', I'm feelin' weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help, I had to catch a cab first
To one-forty-first and Bradhurst
That's where Bones live, walked in the buildin', staggerin'
Lookin' tore down, shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye, he knew he would die
Started to cry, stuck the gat to his head and said, ""Why?""
Then he offered me, all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out, he's ass-out, then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood, about to pass out
The hospital's up, a couple of blocks, I'm on my way but
Damn, here comes a couple of cops, I pulled out
And started blowin' they started blowin' back I'm goin' all out
I ain't holdin' back, I been to jail once and I ain't goin' back
I kept shootin', one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin' real bad, and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear, so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin' everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them, run for they share and all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear now I can hear the sirens
That means here comes the Jakes but it's too late
I'm knockin' on the pearly gates
Yeah, casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya

I run with intruders, looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddhas and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
I'm the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
So when I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends, like there he go!
I never had rules to follow, none of my jewels are hollow
Try to take mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games, I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out, with suicidal thoughts
All my life I been a lady bruiser, a wrong chooser
School refuser, drug abuser, born loser
Clothes bummy, nose runny, it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
I'mma hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I’m better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward, so fronting on me, I won't allow it
I'm high powered, fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front, get your belly torn, I keep a Pelle on
I'm fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom Pérignon
Cause on the Ave. I pump rocks, quick to give a chump knots
You ain't tough, the only thing you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber
, cute chicks get the dick
And ugly bitches get the wrong number

When I bone, I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around 8 P.M
Pockets crazy slim, jumped out the gray BM
Went to the ATM, took a thou' out
Then later on I had to wild out
In the club, knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom, pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin - which chick number I could dial out
Cause it's L, the Harlem pimp baby, for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And that's ill, playa haters be givin me harsh looks
But I'm tryin to sell records like Garth Brooks
So eff 'em all, when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
Mega-ice is what I'm heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo, I guess it's Perignon
If the na-na's too tight, I throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years
And cats is still thirst - to hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that want to battle;
Get a deal first - I sport the bulletproof, fitted hat
That attitude - you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What? I stay strapped, I go to sleep with my steel
Makin figures while you broke cats keepin it real
L is rap's most livest cat
I'm gettin stacks while you askin people
""Do you want fries with that?""
I rob fags in the staircase, no mask, bare-faced
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced - do I walk around without papes? No way pal
Word up - my money longer than the OJ trial

Harlem world, holdin it down
L rhyme great, Nigga Long overdue
They want know if you still got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
Harlem world, holdin it down (""Big L"")
L rhyme great, Nigga Long overdue (""Big L, so amazin'!"")

Them lil' niggas that be rapping on my block'll diss you
If you not official, when i cock the pistol
Lick a shot and hit you, spit the ox and rip you, plot to get you
Nigga fuck boxing with you
Brothers can't believe how the skills have gotten
And I'm still mad plottin', the big apples mad rotten
The rap cocking, I'm that hot and my gat popping
I rap with the black stocking cap, over my face
Taking over the place, put the toast in your face
Open the safe, gimme the money the sculpture and the vase
I run with niggas that'll throw a key of coke in your face
Niggas'll sign anything when that dough in your face
I put two in your asshole, tryna ruin my rap flow
I spit like I'm chewing tobacco, we stack dough
And pack fo' in the Range Rover
Party Arty the flamethrower, game over

Harlem world, holdin it down
L rhyme great, Nigga Long overdue (""Big L"")
They want know if you still got it? (""It's so amazin'!"")
Harlem world, holdin it down (""Big L"")
L rhyme great, Nigga Long overdue (""Big L, So amazin'!"")

Yo, yo move the fuck, A bring the heat, when I touch tracks
These niggas beef then wanna chill? Fuck that
These rap niggas with the mills, we deduct that
I asked all my ghetto cats, where my love at
Now where the brews, and the drugs at?
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
Puff with the dread, cause I puff black
High, til I die, and you can trust that
All I wanna know - is the club packed?
I see the haters sweatin shorty, but I dug that
She put my nutsac, back where her lungs at - little ho
And them niggas who owe, give up that
Huh, it's me and Corle', like Eddie and Nolte
Go 'head and provoke me
Heard you rap, wanna rhyme? Better be dope B
Still ""Diggin"", still livin, still givin
Y'all the ill written, still fuckin like Bill Clinton
 (x2)

Deadly Combination (Azəricə),UnKnown,2000.0,"Bəli, qarşınızda Mix kralı Ron G!
Dünyanın hələ hazır olmadığı bir şeyim var!
New York, L.A., Chicago, Atlanta, D.C.,
Detroit, New Orleans
Siz mövzunu bilirsiz, stil!

Hahahaha! Yeah zənci
Yeah, eynən! Beybi!
Bax bunu belə edirik

Məni izlə, söylə məni başa düşürsən?
Məncə, zəncilər məni öldürməyə çalışır
Tapancalarından çıxan iti uclu mərmilərin
Məni deşməsini xəyal edirlər
Doğrusun desəm, kriminal düşüncələrimi
Belə gizlətsəm, hələ də silah daşımağı düşünərəm
Görürsüz, zəncilər yanlış edir
Məhkəmələrdə oturub xəbərçiyə çevrilirlər
Əvvəllər həqiqiykən, indi çürümüş qəhbədilər
Güclü olmağa çalışıram
Məni bombalamaq üçün ordu göndərirlər
Ron-u dinləyin, məni sakitləşdirə biləcək tək Dj-di
Daima silahlıyam, tapancam məni isti saxlayır
Fırtınada qalmışam, dünyadan köçənə qədər
""Sikim dünyanı""
Qəhbələr diqqətli olun, söz sənətdir, məhv olarsız
Giulani-yə cumuram, çünki zəncilərimə yanlış edib
Və mən gedənə qədər davam etdi, məni təsəvvür et
Bu axmaq qəhbələrə atəş açıram və
Azad olmaq üçün çabalayıram
İzlə məni, zəncilər bunu istəmir
Sənin də başına gələ bilər
Əminəm ki, bunları deməyim qısqanc zənciləri dəli edir
Bu ""Thug Life""dı dostum, fahişələri yedizdirmərik
Mənimlə tərs düş və yüzlərlə adam üstünə 4-4lərlə gəlsin
Hahahaha! Yeah, zənci! ""Thug Life""!

Mən o cavan, yaraşıqlı, ""cool"", sağlam, şanlı oğlanam
Pis oğlanam, eynən Notorious B.I.G. kimi
Adamı sarsaram Shawn Carter kimi
Çoxlu oyunlarla, Ron Harper-dən də çox
Bomba partladan reper xətt silahlı soyğunçu
Siz tinlərdə bomj kimi və hallıykən
Mən pulun ala biləcəyi ən yaxşı şeyləri alıram
İstəyirsiniz ki, mənim mövqeyimdə olasız
Əla qafiyə etmək, almazların parıltısı, avtoqraf imzalamaq
Mənim həyat tərzim əsrarəngizdi
Hər həftə fərqli bi maşınlayam
Hər gecə klublara gedirəm və bütün barı alıram
Çünki pul qazanıram, küçə səhnəsində rolum böyükdü
Mən hər dəfə mikrofona toxunanda
Sən dəlilərin qışqırıqların eşidərsən

Yeah, yeah, Big L... Harlem-in ən yaxşısı
Şəhərin yuxarısını işğal edən zənci...
Hahahaha! Burda bu işi belə edirik
Undergroun budur, dostum
Bu alovdu, dostum
İndi bunu başa qaytar
Bilirsən ki, kömək edə bilməzsən
Ölümcül kombinasiya!",https://genius.com/Big-l-deadly-combination-azric-lyrics
