"They’re Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!","Make the Music with Your Mouth, Biz EP",1986,"Remember when they used to say
That there would be something blay
And said that my beat delay wouldn't work
Well
You walk right out the door
And see me practice more and more
Now it seems that i'm absurdably obsessed
That's why, they're coming to take me away
Ha-haaa!

They're coming to take me away
Ho-hoo!
He-hee!
Ha-haaa!
To the funny farm, where beats are stolen all the time
And whack em caesars stay around
As long I lay a thought
And show the men in the coats i'll be happy to go

Now
You think it's a joke, the things I say
I *Beatboxing beats* all day
It seems that times have taught me
That if you troll, chan
You'll know you laugh
I heard you laugh

You have the dirt to tell me
I'm totally mad?
I don't know why

They're coming to take me away

Why do you gotta take me away, man?
But every time they put me in
The room that makes you
Break
Now
All of those times you called me whack
My rhythms sections
They're all one track
The Bass, the stairs
The hots for all your needs
You just wait
I'll find it yet
I'll drive you nuts
They rhymes play beats
Well, I play cuts
That's why, they're

They're coming to take me away

But when they come and take me away
They would put me in this room
That I just go crazy, and
Break
Now
Looney Toons, go down the hall
My beats don't ever patter off the wall
They try to put a jacket around my lips
Well
If you put me away, you're totally wrong
I'm not gonna do it, my bass is so strong
My highs will probably wind up breakin' glass

The Vapors,Goin’ Off,1988,"Radio, TV, and even the press
Know the meanin of V-A-P-O-R-S
The meanin' of this word without no doubt
Means nobody wants to be there when you’re down and out
Once you’re established and got a lot of money
Everybody wanna be your buddy and honey
Like tall buildings they call skyscrapers

Can you feel it, nothing can save ya
For this is the season of catching the vapors
And since I got time, what I'm gonna do
Is tell you how this spreaded throughout my crew
Well you all know TJ Swan who sang on my records
""Make the Music"", ""Nobody Beats the Biz"", well, check it
Back in the days before this began
He used to try to talk to this girl name Fran
The type of female with fly Gucci wear
With big truck jewelry and extensions in her hair
When Swan tried to kick it, she always fessed
Talking about ""Nigga please, you work for UPS""
Since he wasn't no type of big drug dealer
My man TJ Swan didn't appeal to her
But now he trucks gold and wear fly Bally boots
Rough leather fashion and tough silk suits
Now she stop fronting and wants to speak and
Be coming to all the shows every single weekend
To get his beeper number, she'd be begging please
Dying for the day to get skeezed

She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors
She caught the vapors

I got another partner that's calm and plain
He goes by the name of the Big Daddy Kane
A mellow type of fellow that's laid back
Back in the days he was nothing like that
I remember when he used to fight every day
What grown-ups would tell him he would never obey
He wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
And a rasta-type Kangol tilted to the side
Around his neighborhood people treated him bad
And said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
They said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
Or either in jail, or someone would shoot him
But now he's grown up, to their surprise
Big Daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
Now the same people that didn't like him as a child
Be saying can I borrow a dollar, ooh, you're a star now

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Now I got a cousin by the name of Vaughan Lee
Better known to y'all as Cutmaster Cool V
He cuts, scratch, transform with finesse
{imitates cuts and scratches} and all that mess
Well I remember when he first started to rock
And tried to get this job in a record shop
He was in it to win it but the boss fronted
Said, ""Sorry Mr. Lee, but there's no help wanted""
Now my cuz Vaughan still tried on and on and on
'Til the like break of dawn
To put this j-o-b in effect
But they'd look right past him and be like, ""Next""
Now for the year of '88
Cool V is making dollars so my cousin's like straight
He walks into the same record shop as before
And the boss be like, ""Vaughan, welcome to my store""
Offering him a job but naw, he don't want it
Damn, it feels good to see people up on it
Cause I remember when at first they wasn't
Now guess what they caught from my cousin
The vapors

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors

Last subject of the story is about Biz Mark
I had to work for mine to put your body in park
When I was a teenager, I wanted to be down
With a lot of MC-DJ'ing crews in town
So in school on Nobel Street, I say ""Can I be down, champ""
They said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
After getting rejected I was very depressed
Sat and wrote some def doo-doo rhymes at my rest
When I used to come to parties they'd make me pay
I would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
I was never into girls, I was just into my music
They acted like I wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
But now things switched, without belief
""Yo, Biz, do you remember me from Noble Street, chief?
We used to be down back in the days""
It happens all the time and never cease to amaze

They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors
They caught the vapors",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-the-vapors-lyrics
Nobody Beats the Biz,Goin’ Off,1988,"Yes, y'all and, to the like beat and
You could either dance or just have a seat and
Listen to the way and, what I am displaying
A different kind of rapper language that I am saying
To all the party people that absorbs the info
When it come to rocking parties I am a nympho
Maniac, brainiac for doing my dance
And my record Make the Music will put you in a trance and
Hypnotize your body and, like you do Bacardi and
You won't be fighting or illing, you just be partying
Down, with the funky sound with yours truly
I'm the original B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I but the E
I came to have fun and, not be number one and
Just hear to let you know, who's like running the place
And everywhere that I perform and do a show
As long as you know that...

Nobody beats the Biz
(Nobody beats the Biz)
(repeat 4X)

You know me as the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E and
I go for what I know doing a show for human beings
I'm guaranteed to rock I make the ladies scream and shout
I'm bound to wreck your body and say turn the party out
The Mardi rapper toe-tapper always having fun
And when you hear the Biz Markie, I get the job done
Yes I'm the M-A-R the K-I-E you know that's me
I got the stutter step to keep in check my speed is so unique
They say I look and sound funny but I don't be caring
I rock the Latin Quarter, Rooftop, Union Square and
Roseland, the Heartthrob, Madison Square Garden
Even rocked for the World’s Fair at Javits Center
Pardon the way that I be talking 'bout the places I be rocking
I love to perform for the people that be clocking
Not sayin that you're on mine or on it like a hornet
But you pay for a good performance, doggone it, you want it
That's why I'm here, to be like letting you knowing
That I'mma highly recognized as the king of discoing
Making people laugh and have a lot of enjoyment
I'm the best person for this type of employment
That's why...


On and on to the break of dawn
When you buy food cheap, you need a coupon
Or catch a sale retail, before it gets stale
So hurry up and get the WIC check out the mail
And shop non-stop, but how I hip-hop
On the mic and like make you co-op-
-erate with the rhythm, that is what I give em
Reagan is the Pres but I voted for Shirley Chisholm
It might sound confusing, the style that I'm using
But in the end I'm sure that you will find it quite amusing
And funny, oh honey, it's just ridiculous
Don't try to front, come on and admit you was
Thrilled, chilled, your heart was fulfilled
So respect the architect as I begin to build
Science and my reliance is upon my rap
Like Carl Lewis I get to it, so let's go the lap",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-nobody-beats-the-biz-lyrics
Pickin’ Boogers,Goin’ Off,1988,"Now this may sound disgusting and like very gross
But it's sure to have you trippin', so yo, listen close
It's not bright as the sun or sweet like sugar
But it's rather on the bug tip and it's called Pickin' Boogers
Now what I'm MCin' might not seem kosher to you
But it's still somethin' we all have to do
So go up your nose with a finger or two
And pull out one or a crusty crew
Yo, don't try to front like it's so gloomy and gray
'Cause we all pick our boogers some time every day
Whether out in the open or on a sneak tip
With a finger, tissue, or even a Q-Tip
Take it from the Biz Markie because I'm jokin'
And also, remember this slogan
""
Hey, ma, what's for dinner
?
Go up your nose and pick a winner""

Pickin' Boogers (4x)

Let me tell you what happened on the train, man
I was coolin' one day with my partner Kane
Headed up to the 
Rooftop
, ridin' the D train
When the man sittin' next to me was so profane
He'd stick his finger up his nose, then do a drain
(You should 'a moved)
I was just about, but all of a sudden, homeboy just pulled out
A big green slimy — nah, I'm not neven gonna say it
But it weighed a good pound if you tried to weigh it
He sat there for a while with it in his hand
So I tried to play cool and like ignore the man
So I laid my head back to catch a quick a nap
All of a sudden he plucked it dead in my lap
Now Kane sat there laughing like it was all a joke
But a brother like Biz Markie had almost choked
So I dug up my nose and pulled out about five
And plucked every last one of them dead in his eye
Then the man jumped up and said ""What's wrong with you?""
And wiped them off his face and said ""I can't mess with you!""
Like if I did something that was so full of shame
But yo, you got to know the name of the game


Hmmm....
Now let me take a trip down memory lane
Back in public school with my partner Kane
When I was class clown, and he was my brother
Sittin' at the desk pluckin' boogers at each other
Never doin' work as we was supposed
'Cause we was too busy diggin' up our nose
And in the lunchroom you would talk about rude
God forbid the person that'd leave his food
No matter who you are we didn't give a damn
We even put teachers down with the program
Whether if it was a woman or if you a man
We put boogers on our fingers then shake ya hand
Catch anyone from anywhere
But the best fun about it catchin' Kane out there
Especially when we playin' ball in the gym
I put boogers on the basketball and pass it to him
Now we're grown up and things have changed
But we still be playin' the pickin' boogers game
Just last night, when Kane was gettin' ready
I slipped a little green one inside his spaghetti


Let me tell you what happened to me with this girl...
One night at 
Latin Quarters
 I was standin' at ease
I saw this gorgeous young lady that I wanted to skeez
I didn't show enough that I really did want it
So, no half steppin', I pushed up on it
Pulled out the gold cable and I knocked her with phat
Had a spotlight beamin' on my Biz Marck hat
But when she stepped in the light and she got real close
I saw a tiny weeny booger on the tip of her nose
She was dressed real def and her body was hooked
But that dried up booger just ruined her look
I wanted to tell her about it but I couldn't be bold
So I played if off and said ""that's a cute green mole""
I was hopin' from that she would wipe it away
But she didn't do nothin' I guess she wanted it to stay
I said before you get my number, I don't mean to diss you
But write it in your hand because you're gonna need the tissue",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-pickin-boogers-lyrics
"Make the Music With Your Mouth, Biz",Goin’ Off,1988,"Ah one two, ah one two
Ah one two, ah one two
I'd like to.. introduce myself..
My name is.. ah Biz Markie..

Well I'm the human orchestra called Biz Markie
Makin music orally is my specialty
When I go {*BOOM*} ah one two, girls get excited
When they hear my lyrics they wanna recite 'em
I know y'all in the mood, just go with the flow
And I can play rappin records and all disco
Like ""Beat It,"" ""Billie Jean,"" by Michael Jackson
Or the Treacherous 3 record, they call ""Action""
When you hear me do it, you will be shocked and amazed
It's the brand new thing they call the human beatbox craze

Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Make the music with your mouth, biz!
{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}

Well I don't just do the beatbox, I rock on the mic
And all the rhymes that I say, all the people like
I get the crowd jumpin, get the girl's hearts pumpin
All the party people say, ""Isn't he somethin?""
Rock from New York City all the way down South
Sayin rhymes and makin music, with my mouth
I'mma tell you party people how I began
It started when I'm livin in Long Is-land
Hey when I was a kid I used to play in the streets
Makin sounds with my mouth, all sorts of beats
Grown people, used to say - WHAT?
Grown people, used to say - WHAT'S..
.. wrong with that kid makin that strange noise
It was like, for all the fly girls and all the homeboys
Then I tried it at a homeboy's basement par-ty
They thought it was a record, they ain't know it was me
When they came by the DJ, and saw who it is
They said, ""Make the music with your mouth, Biz!""

{*song continues as just a beat for a while*}

It may look and sound easy doin the human beatbox
But it's real difficult, even knocked me out my socks
It's a movement combination with your lip tongue and throat
Use your teeth and your nose for a mysterious high note
I like doin it as a hobby or a job
People treat me like a star and surround me in the mall
It's not all about, spittin, breathin hard and chewin
You need practice, be ambitious in the schoolin
Let me tell you party people, you gotta admit
Anything than you want you gotta work hard for it
That's why I like doin sounds, that's hard to achieve
Makin two or three sounds at one time you can't believe
When I walk down the street, people crowd around me
And say, ""HOW YOU MAKE ALL THEM SOUNDS at one time, Biz Markie?""
I tell 'em it takes a lot of practice, and lip control
I've been doin it since, fifteen years old
And everywhere I do it, the people say I'm good
I even get big respect in my own neighborhood
I'm tellin you a fact, it's just like it is
Even moms, pops, and cops say, ""Whattup, Biz?""
Everywhere I go, I always rocked the boat
Gonna end this rhyme, with this one note
Not gonna act conceited and say I'm the best
But I'm guaranteed to pass any kind of test
I say def rhymes, with funky fresh lyrics
When I do the beat the party people go into HYSTERICS!


You heard the beginning, now here's the sequel
All human beatboxes is not created equal
That's why I'm here, to say today
That I'm doin my beat in a special way
Makin musical tunes, orally, I have perfected
I'm very well known, and greatly respected
I like to thank people, without no doubt
Peace hi party people it's time to break ou--

Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
Make the music.. make the music..
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!
MAKE THE MUSIC.. with your mouth!

Biz is Goin’ Off,Goin’ Off,1988,"Hey to everybody and, people that say partyin
It's time to hear a funky rhyme from me the Biz Markie again
As I just display 'em, the way I like say 'em
The stutter steppin style that I use to amuse and HEY
I'm the original, hellified king-ing
For freaky sound, for throwin down, and you know that I'm bringing
The crowd to enjoyment, by what I do
Like {*ah-oww-oww WAHHAZOOW, boom, ah one two*}
I keep the people cheerin, because of what they hearin
Movin and groovin, to a devestatin sound that's glarin
Because they're in the mood for me
The B-I-Z the Emmezah-Emmezah-A-R-K-I-E
The party rippin, never trippin, king of crowd pleasin
I can turn it out without a doubt in any season
I entertain crowds, a million and thous'
Homeboys makin noise, as I do browse through a girl's blouse
Say the funky rhyme to make the girls get naked
I can turn it out, with different sounds on my record
That I say give 'em, as y'all exault the rhythm
The magnificent record maker of Prism

The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off

Ha ha ha ha ha! Check out this bizarre
Rappin style used by me, the B-I-Z
Emm-A-R-K-I with the E and, you will be agreein
A brother ain't a brother unless he is say like G'n
Up with his technique and, keep the people freakin
Like me the Biz Markie because my style is so unique and
Guaranteed to rock the mic with rhymes that I say
I'm just as good as Clint Eastwood, so won't you make my day
Markie the original, yes I am the boss
And I can rock the microphone for you and yours
Go {*boom, ah one two*} 'til my voice is hoarse
Then take a pause, annnd you know, of course
I can rock a party, with so much force
I'm the greatest entertainer Marley came across
Puttin pictures in photomat to give 'em a gloss
And I don't eat spaghetti without the meat sauce
Whether Ragu, Prego, Hunt's or Aunt Millie
You wanna get dissed? Then try to get illy
With me the inhuman, because I'm like boomin
Reagan is the Pres, but so was Harry Truman

The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz {*""Go off, go off!""*}
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz, Mark, is, ah goin off
The Biz {*""Go off, go off!""*}

Now! I make rhymes, each and every day
And always seem to come up with somethin fresh to say
In January, February, March April May
And the other seven months of the year, but anyway
Hey, feel the lay okay, here's a rhyme I must display
When I'm finished you be in it sayin HIP HIP HOORAY!
I will be an emcee, 'til I'm old and grey
And I can even rock the mic with tooth decay, decay
Yo - ladies of the 80's know that I'm the
Original B-I-Z-M-A-R-K-I say with an E
You know me, and my man Big Daddy
I can't forget, Cutmaster Cool V
And my partner, my best friend TJ Swannie
Rockin the mic would say most definitely
So listen don't be missin, I will never be dissin
I just rock the mic, and always have discipline
Listen to the brother ain't no other you discover
I rock up the mic just like if I'm, your, mother!

Go Biz Mark! Go Biz Mark!

Albee Square Mall,Goin’ Off,1988,"On the mic at this time in the place to be
I'm the Inhuman Orchestra called Biz Markie
That made you dance, make the music with my mouth, and all
But I'm here to talk about the Albee Square Mall
A place where people shop in downtown Brooklyn
Where I can be found if you're lookin'
For me, the B-i-z, so just come check me out
'Cause 24/7 I'm mikin' the house
So when I come in the Mall, and then I start to roam
You wouldn't think it's a store, you would think it's my home
'Cause when I come in the place, then I hang up a sign
Reads ""Home sweet home"" - this house is mine

Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

I been to many malls from state to state
But I've never been in, say, one this great, I hate
To say, about the other shopping centers that's left
But the Albee Square Mall is the doo-doo-def
I be in there everyday, walkin' around chillin'
From when they opened all the way until when
It's about time for the place to close
I'm just running things like a pair of panty hose
They all know me, the Biz Markie
I get more respect than the average employee
Could work in every store in the mall
Because the place is my house from wall to wall
If I could move in, party people, I just might
So I could stay forever, and it won't be just like
A bum that you see sleepin' on a park bench
So how will it be when you see Biz Markie
I fade them all, been havin' fun
See, to me this mall is like number one
And any other shoppers there that try to compare
There ain't no way they could hang out with Albee Square

Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall
My house is the Albee Square Mall

I step in the place and shop around for a while
Buy some jewelry for Treny and Ali, and after that I'll
Go take a stroll inside of Gibb's Pups
Then buy some fresh silks, Bally's too
Next stop Olympic, wanted to buy some sneakers
Then hit the Game Room to pick me up a Cesar
Stroll around with a fly female
While security's riffin' about leanin' on the rail
After that I go eat some food at Wendy's
In the Albee cafeteria, could be shoppin' plenty
From store to store just stuffin' face
And I do the pfrr-one-two while sayin' my grace
Finally I step off all alone
Up to the top level to use the telephone
Never use a quarter, 'cause I got a calling card
So I can reach out and touch everybody I know
That's where I be until the day is done
Just coolin' in the place that's number one
So next time you'll be in Brooklyn walkin' around
Play like ""Price Is Right"" and ""come on down""
And

Go shoppin'
Go shoppin'
Go shop - let's all go shoppin' (3x)
Go shoppin'
Go shoppin'
Go shoppin' - Swan and Biz go shoppin'

This is Something for the Radio,Goin’ Off,1988,"This is another hit from Biz Markie
Dedicated to the radio, not he or she
Be-cause it's time for them to get recognized
This is my version of the Nobel Peace Prize
That's why I'm comin out my face like this
Far as negativity, you never get dissed
If it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

This rhyme is dedicated to the radio DJ's
That play all the hits on seven days
And even on the weekends, the DJ's will be freakin
Without a doubt because everyone is unique-and
The way they cut the records, and be talkin
It sound doo doo EXTRA CRAZY DEF on the Walkman
To all the disc jockey's that's on the go
This is something for the radiohhhh
{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of ""for the radio"" randomly*}
Now I'ma kick it like this

I'd like to thank all the people state to state
For requestin my records on the radio great-ly
Appreciate what you've done for me
And my reward to you is my M-U-S-I-C
Straight up, I make the music just for you
So you can do the extra crazy Biz Mark dance too
Or even do the dance made up by yourself
As long as you're in good phy-sical health
Because you're the one that make the radio hype
Like fresh tobacco and a brand new pipe
A program director always pick the right hits
Like puttin some salt and pepper and butter on grits
I ALWAYS look up to program directors
Cause they're the ones, the jam selectors
A couple of years ago when I didn't have a record player
On the radio I thought to myself sayin
If I ever get the chance to playin my stuff
I'm gonna make everything extra tough
Cause radio will last to infinity
As long as my name is the B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-R-K and I'm hear to say
Number one entertainment form in the like U.S.A
Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh
{*Biz ad libbing a harmony of ""for the radio"" and singing shoutouts*}

This is the conclusion of just the beginnin
Of hip-hop on the radio, mix never endin
Story and fightin, just to get the right and
Have our respect on a station that's excitin
In about two years, I will be a superstar
Be able to buy anything I want, even a car
Cause if it wasn't for you, nobody would know
That's why this is something for the radiohhhh

Shake from side to side, witcha arms and hips

Just a Friend,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour, at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage, drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if ya hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said: ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said: ""How do you like the show?"" She said: ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"", she tried to pretend
She said: ""No, I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on!
I'm not even goin' for it, this is what I'm goin' sing

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jack
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named ""blah-blah-blah"" that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time, so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her, it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, but then I called again
I say: ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that!
Jus' bust this

You, you got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend
, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You got what I need
But you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend

So, I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl, that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
""Yo, could you tell me where is door three?""
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So, I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap!
 Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in her mouth
I was so in shock, my heart went down south
So please, listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend...",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-just-a-friend-lyrics
Spring Again,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"Yo this one aight though
Yo, me and Cool V
Dis dis dis gon' be dis gon' be our new single
And when you hear this story you'll say it's aight though
Yo yo yo yo Cool V, why don't you give me a cue
One more cue, and then I'm ready to go in

Don't you like when the winter's gone
And all of a sudden it starts gettin warm
The trees and the grass start lookin fresh
And the sun and sky be lookin their best
Birds be singin, flowers be bloomin
A lot of brand new cars be zoomin
Fly girls lookin the best they can be
And the guys be dukey dukey Dan you see
Besides all that I like the warm weather
Cause that's when you can get yourself together
But I like Easter time with a grin
Cause when I was little we used to go to Coney I-sland
We used to eat a lot of stuff like cotton candy
Cause back then, it was like fine and dandy
You used to get dressed up in double knits
And your plaid suit jackets, they were the shits
The good ol' days, was back then
And the reason I reminisce, cause..

It's spring again
Everybody know it's spring again
To the girls and boys and people above
This is the time to fall in love

Now girls - have you ever broke up with your boyfriend
And you felt that the world was comin to an end
Sittin around the house poutin for no reason
Just because you thought your man was skeezin
For a couple of days, look gloomy and gray
Thinkin about the ol' happy days
All of a sudden, the telephone ring
He beg for your forgiveness and you know what that brings
Joy and happiness into your life
Before you felt like your heart was stabbed by a knife
I'm tellin you girls, keep the man that you got
Cause if he cheats, you might need a VD shot
You know two wrongs don't make a right
And if you did somethin wrong, don't do the same it's not polite
Please don't make this breakin up a trend, BECAUSE.. BECAUSE..


Now fellas - have you ever met a girl that tried to front
And wanted you to act like you was on a hunt
I used to see my homeboys frown and fret
For a girl that always tryin to play hard to get
I know I caught it myself, I must admit
And said - anything you want you gotta work hard for it
Me the Diabolical, be obsessed?
And go after somethin that a girl posess?
They're really on yours like a pair of drawers
They want you to be like Santa Claus
They want drug dealers, and four-wheelers
Truck jewelry, they expect you to steal her
Sheeeeit, I know they must be buggin
They better hit the streets and do their own muggin
But in this case, you would just overlook her
Send her on her way and say I can't help you hooker

A Thing Named Kim,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"One two, one two
The Diabolical's back again
With the Cutmaster Cool V
At the boards my man Paul Sea
But this goes out to my man Danny Dan
The beat man that makes you understand
He want me to tell somethin bout this girl named Kim
I'ma do it like this

Well it was one of those days when nothing's right with the world
I was half broke, bored, and fed up with my girl
Lookin for somethin to do but wonderin how long
It would take for the next thing to go wrong
So I decided to hang, go out and ease my mind
I told myself you would never know what you might find
I took a hot bubble bath, instead of a shower
Got rid of ""The Dragon,"" it took me a hour
Decided on a sweatsuit, Gucci red and white
Some rings and some ropes, and then I'm on for the night
The Gucci sneakers some cologne, I think Aramis
I look in the mirror and said, ""Biz you look - marvelous!""
I jetted out the door, and hailed a taxi
And said ""54 in a hurry,"" and jumped in the backseat
We arrived he said, ""$8.50 and that don't count my tip""
I said, ""Don't drink and drive -
GIMME MY CHANGE before I bust ya lip!""
The club was jumpin and word is bond
I saw girls walkin around with jeans painted on
Splittin they skirts up the middle, tight leather and lace
Both me and Jimmy agree, we're gonna like this place
Took a seat at the bar, the girl said what are ya drinkin?
A Coke and a smile child, and slid her a Lincoln
Took a sip of my four dollars, she looked at me strange
I said, ""Psych I bet you thought you was gonna keep the change""
I made my way through the crowd, it was plain to see
Same everywhere I go, all eyes on me
I sat down at the table, and one of the staff
Said, ""Ain't you the Biz"" I said, ""Yeah but no autographs""
I sat alone in the corner, and sipped my drink
Happened to look across the room and somebody winked
I did the only thing the Diabolical could do
Looked down to see what that I was attached to
Sure enough it was a girl, a sweet female
Her hair and eyes sparkled like ginger ale
I looked lower to her lips, her chin and her neck
And fantasized about the rest, then decided to check
I sent champagne to her table, the waiter asked her name
He returned with Kim, and I almost came
I checked myself and made sure, I looked alright
And told my dick, ""Don't worry - we're fuckin tonight!""
Threw her the Kool-Aid smile, and a dash of charm
I stepped to the lady and tapped her arm
But when she turned around, my smile turned to gloom
She didn't look none like she looked across the room
She had big broad shoulders and her titties was big
They were filled with silicone, and her hair was a wig
She had more makeup than Boy George and Phyllis Diller
Ugly enough to be a monster in ""Thriller""
Had hair on her chest longer than King Spade
Even though I got a band, I don't need the AIDS
So I hurried out and left, she said, ""Please stay""
I said, ""Sorry money grip, I don't go that way""
So I stepped out in a hurry, to gather my wits
And thought that's a damn shame, he had nice tits
And that's the last I ever saw of Kim
You wanna know why?  Cause she's a he and her's a him
Like that and-a, like that and-a
I'm not the man called Dantana
You go on and on and on and on and on and on and on
Don't go to Getty, go to Exxon.. {*echoes*}",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-a-thing-named-kim-lyrics
Things Get a Little Easier,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"And yes y'all, yes y'all
This is, a different type of dedication
To my man Marcus from Kansas City
But I'm just tellin ya straight on up
Don't be messin with no drugs
Whether you're young, whether you're old
Whether you're bad, whether you're bold
Don't mess with it cause it's not for the soul
And we gonna do it a little somethin
With three subjects like this..

Subject one is about a brother by the name of John
Who was sellin crack, just like it was Avon
And you know y'know the reason I say ""was""
Because that's no longer what my man John does
There was a time when he was wearin much gold
Drivin a Benz, Jaguar and a Rolls
The lifestyle he lived was far from penny ante
Yo-ho-ho-ho-ho, word to granny's panties
Cause he would make dough-roll, and swing it like a yo-yo
Bein broke, was just a no-no
But then the day came when John got caught
And he was dropped like pantyhose without support
You shoulda thought about, what you did in the past
To realize, this fast livin wouldn't last
But, the same guy that was a big hoodlum
Is now in jail, waitin for someone to duke him

Things get a little easier
Once you learn to understand it

Subject two, and this one is a doozy
A messed up story about a girl named Suzy
Now when you're on WIC, the problems may seem enough
But you know she had to get Scotty to beam her up
On a crack mission, no type of ambition
Make blunts disappear better than a magician
Her eyes got dim, her body got slim
She said there's nothin in the world like a good ol' stem
On and like on and, and it was strong
Grabbed her pipe and sung a song
""I want to get HIGH.. so high!""
""I want to get HIGH.. so high!""
She'd go out buy a nice rock just to suit her
Then hit the weed spot to be blessed by buddha
Bum offa Lucy to complete her stimulation
Put it all together for a perfect combination
I mean this girl would actually buy a rock with
The very last dime she got in her pocket
And when she saw her friends, comin from the spot
Like Prudential, she got a piece of their rock
That's why


Subject three, finally, the
E-N-D about a girl by the name of Marie
She used to be hot, most beautiful to the utmost
I mean this girl was blessed with an overdose
Of curves, swerves, word to the mother my brother
And boy did the B-I-Z love her
But then.. {*singing*} those.. were.. the.. DAYS
My friend.. we thought they'd never end
And she looked alright, to the S-K Biz Markie
But then she got on drugs
Started wearin extensions and rugs
And let me tell you what say happened to Marie
{*rapping*} because nowadays Marie don't look so hot
Everytime that I see her, she's headed for the spot
Her hair is all knotty, got Scotty got her body
And her underarms kickin like the ho know karate
Her clothes are real dirty, and usually the same
As for money she don't have a dime to claim
Because when I saw the girl the other day
She was puttin a pack of Now-or-Laters on layaway
 - fades out",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-things-get-a-little-easier-lyrics
The Dragon,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"Now this is a difficult subject
About something that's crazy - oh, what the heck
They know they have something that people don't like
And they still continue to disrespect
The thing I'm talking about is an essence
A foreign fragrance with a presence
That you can't see with the naked eye
But to the nose it's a nuisance
It comes in so many forms, it's camouflaged
And it will sneak upon you like espionage
You might not know it cause it won't show it
And you will swear it's just a mirage
It can be with you when you're talking
It will be so close, you think it's hawking
With a bit of a twang it got its own slang
Is even known in New York, and
Everybody know what I'm saying
From here to the Himalayan
If you don't know, you must be doo-doo
This is what I'm saying
About the dragon

I think I should go more into depth
About a secret that is quiet as kept
If you have it like Richochet Rabbit
It can ruin your rep
There are ways of preventing this
Check your hygiene and your dentist
You might think I'm messing, but this is a lesson
Godliness is cleanliness
But if you think I'm misguiding you
By saying there's something inside of you
That bothers everybody when you're at a party
And your reactions to it is: ""pee you!""
You're sitting there baffled and puzzled
Whatever you have, you wish you was muzzled
But if you want a clue, between me and you
It could be the beverage you guzzled
But if you listen to me
The diabolical energetical B
The I-Z Mza-Mza-A-R-K-I-E
I'm tryina give you H-E-L-P
So I'ma end it off like this
Before you give somebody a kiss
For the one you adore, check them before
You get a crazy whiff
Of the dragon

I once knew a guy by the name of Tock
He was one of them kids from like around the block
The kid was cool, had the right gear, and slim
The only thing was wrong, he smelled like a gym
His secret telling rumors, his right guard went left
And his band was playing a song that was funky to def
He was kicking like Bruce Lee and Jim Kelly
Word is bond, that kid was smelly
Even if he would shower and shower
A sprinkle a day, wouldn't last for a hour
He would always wanna like hang around
His underarms had bass with Sensurround
I tried to tell him, but he just wouldn't listen
He thought from my heart I was trying to diss him
I started beating around the bush cause he thought I was nagging
I said, ""Yo Tock, you got the dragon!""",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-the-dragon-lyrics
She’s Not Just Another Woman (Monique),The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"I once knew a girl by the name of Monique
She was my childhood sweetheart every day of the week
Whether PS46, or 151
After school I'd go to her house, to have some fun
We both lived in Colonial Projects
I lived in building 48, she lived in building 26
We used to play Ringling, Coke or 1-2-3
But when I'm in Monique's presence, I would just freeze
The relationship began when I was five startin
She was in nursery school, I was in kindergarten
We was more closer than a hand and glove
This is what you call real puppy love
When we'd go trick or treating, I would carry her bag
When we moved to Long Island, it was all such a drag
Cause I know it would be difficult to see her again
I wouldn't miss her more than I'd miss all of my friends
Even though we was little this love was unique
And this is what I say to my love Monique, because

""She's not, just another woman..
She's not, no no!""

Let me tell ya a little somethin, about Monique
Even though we was little she had a physique
Indian brown skin with a nice complexion
She always gave me tender love and affection
I knew she was different in her own little way
I used to knock at her door bout every single day
I remember when we used to go trick or treatin
I used to snatch bags, so she could sink her teeth in
Crazy big variety of a lot of candy
She would share it with her friends Kim Ron and Fran and
Lee-nette, the girl she called her cousin
We never had an argument, oh we was never fussin
That's why me and her got along so good
Anything I asked her to do, you know she would
We would have family day, in back of building 70
I would win her a prize, so she could treat me heavenly
I don't care what nobody say, because
This girl would make my day, and


Now this is the epilogue of this story
About a young little girl, especially for me
No matter how many years ago I can't forget
But then again 1986 hit
She looked just the same, but in a bigger version
My mind started goin on a love excursion
I started reminiscin to her bout old times
She began to smile, I guess I rang her chimes
I didn't see her again until 1988
And I saw her again, and she still was straight
Now this time I had enough courage to speak to her
I told her would you be with me, and what would occur
Then I asked was, she swingin any capers
She said - no not me, nobody got no papers
I couldn't believe, after all of these years
I was so happy she waited it brought me to tears, cause
 - quickly fades out",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-shes-not-just-another-woman-monique-lyrics
Check it Out,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"Yo.. this is kinda slow
But I know the Jeeps gon' be pumpin it
But this is, this is one subject, that nobody don't know about

Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
When you hear my golden voice, you know it's me
The poetical, energetical rap MC
Well that's not the subject matter of to be cool
I'm just tellin you girls and fly kids, stay in school
I always reminisce when I was in class well
But you feel like a simpletone when you get expelled
Or, even if you have a couple of days in detention
It's just as good as one bad suspension
So when you're grown up, you'll say the same thing
To your kids, be in class before the bell ring
But you know, kids is kids
To them high school is like a three year bid
I'm not gonna tell a lie, I used to cut class
Until the principal straight got in my ass
He said, ""Biz the only way you're gonna get a BM
Is to get your education instead of hangin with him""
So I got my head together, and chilled the hell out
And now all the break-breakers says is check him out

Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

Now this is the second part of this lesson
I'm sayin it this way cause it's my profession
You don't have to go to high school to be an MC
But you got to know the value and means, of money
Cause a lot of parents, they are taxpayers
So it's real stupid, when you disobey a
Principal, vice principal or even a teacher
Cause when you do that, you know you'll never reach a
Higher level, or even your goal
Because, you don't wanna listen to what you're told
So please take heed, to what I say
I hope I'm not sayin it for my health today
Cause if I am please tell me, so I can stop
It's not like I'm your mother sister brother or pop
So come on and listen to me without no doubt
So you can be educated and have, clout

Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house
Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

I'm just tellin young people to stay away from drugs
Cause if you mess with that it'll make you bug
Whatever you wanna, like call it, I'm tellin you
Don't become a drug addict or alcoholic
Because it will mess with your mind and brain
And only thing you wanna do is feen and complain
Cause I'm tellin you just like this off the top of my head
Don't mess with it, cause you will be misled
By other people, devils and demons
I'm Biz Markie, I'm not Alfred Simmons
I'm just tellin you to do this, without no doubt
Cause I'm the Biz and I got the clout

Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out

Check him out, check him out, check him out, check him out
With the beat I'm gonna rock the house! {*echoes*}

My Man Rich,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"This is a different type of dedication
To a guy that was a different kind of inspiration
Only people that knew him, know what I'm talkin about
And at the end of the story, you will say without a doubt
This wasn't your typical case, of fast livin
Anything he was makin, he was givin
To his moms, pops, his brother and his girl
Cause they, meant, the most to him in the world
Around Suffolk he wasn't known
But in Eastern Long Island, he did have a home
Called L.I., is where he stayed
Where there was no need for D-Con or Raid
He was cool with everybody, he had no enemies
I'm makin this record, cause he's a friend of me
Cause he's a hard workin kid, I've just stated
That's why this record, is dedicated
To my man Rich
Yo yo, this is for you my man
God bless you

Let me tell you what happened in the early 80's
When we wasn't thinkin about gettin all the ladies
Me and Rich was thinkin about survival of the fittest
You can ask Keith or Kevin, cause both of them were with us
We'd try to get a job everyplace that it takes
We was even at the factory they call {?}
Everywhere we went they said they'd call us back
Or even said they're not hirin to throw us off track
But Richie Rich said, forget that stuff
Even though, times was rough
We kept searchin searchin lookin and lookin
It seems everywhere we went, the jobs was tooken
Still Rich didn't give up the faith
He found a job that wasn't safe
Even though it was dangerous, it wouldn't switch
That's why this is dedicated to my man Rich
Yo this is to you my man Rich
Cause you know you go way back, you go way back
Word up, God bless you

The way the story end, is just a tragedy
I wish upon a star that it didn't have to be
Endin this way for my man Richard
Cause still in my mind, he's still as pictured
Like, he just had gone yesterday
For sellin, C-R-A-C-K
His dream was.. to be a boxer
So, he could knock the socks off of
An Iran Barkley, or even Mike Tyson
But on the streets, he was sacrificin
For his family, and his wife
Cause he struggled, he struggled all his life
He wasn't a straight up, criminal or villain
Or even tryin to get, stupid or illin
Was messed up for takin somebody's life and shit
That tried so hard, and just wouldn't quit
This is a slow record, with a switch
Because it's dedicated, to my man Rich
To you my man
This is to you, Rich

Oh, now you don't know who it's from now right?
Okay, now I'ma just tell you
You know this is from the diabolical energetical
Poetrical numerical new lyrical man, B-I-Z
Emmezah-emmezah-A-R-K-I-E
Best on the scene, man appointed rap king in effect
If you EVER try to disrespect the Biz Markie
Disability checks you collect, BUT ANYWAY!
I'm just bringin you you somethin
A new, a new a little somethin
Because you remember me from y'know, ""The Biz Mark, Biz Mark""
And from the {*beatboxing*} and all that mess
And you know all the other stuff from like, ""Make the Music..""
But yo, but I'd like to dedicate this to, my best friend TJ Swan
My cuz-n, my cousin Cutmaster Cool V
My man, my man, and my man, DJ Marley Marl
Cause we in the studio doin this, this is for my NEW DANCE
So check it out, everybody ready
I think he's ready to get, I-ah-I
I-I just think he's read', I think I'm ready to get hype

I'm the Diabolical, Biz Markie
From ""Pickin' Boogers,"" the ""Vapors"" - ""Make the Music"" you see
But now I'm bringin to you for your enjoyment
It's an animated dance for my employment
You might remember him from Saturday afternoon
He was my favorite character on any cartoon
But when you do the dance, you can't stay kaput
EVERYBODY GET UP.. and do the Mudd Foot
C'MON!  Get up and do the Mudd Foot
C'mon, yo yo, yo c'mon and do the MUDD Foot
""Hey hey,"" yo hey, yo, do the MUDD Foot

Now bust this out
I'm not even gonna get into no rhymin
I just want everybody to listen to the funky beat
While my DJ Cutmaster Cool V, cut up what the name of this dance is
{*Cool V scratches ""Mudfoot""*}

You know, I can't really do all that stuff
You know I'm not into that cuttin, but
I want everybody to the dance, let me show you
You see, you gotta act like you crippled
Like you just got one leg, and you know you just gotta just
You gotta just, ge-ge-ge-ge-ge-just gotta relax
And just, let the music take over your body and just chill
Cause this is the Diabolical B-I-Z, Emmezah-A-Rrrah
You know me from, ""The Biz Mark, Biz Mark""
I already said that already, but it don't even MATTER
Bring the bassline back in, now bust this out
I'm just talkin about, this is gon' be the new thing to take over
The next century, cause it's gettin ready to be the 90's
And I want this to be one of the hottest dances comin out
It's called the ""Mudd Foot""
You know, you you can't do ""The Butt"" off this music
You can't do ""The Wop,"" can't do nuttin else off it
Can't do the ""Michael Jackson""
Only thing you can do off this music is the ""Mudd Foot""
Can't be doin that ""Arsenio Hall""
I don't know I don't know how he do that, m-heh-heh
Or that I.O.U.'n, Scoob and Scrap'n
And anybody else dancin
Only thing you can do off this, is, the ""Mudd Foot""
So c'mon, do the MUDD Foot
Yo, I, see, you know I been here
I been in this studio for about a month
I'm tryin to teach Swan how to do the ""Mudd Foot""
I don't know what the heck he doin, he-heh-heh
Marley can't even do it, yo
I'm tryin to teach, Cool V how to the ""Mudd Foot""
He doin the ""Butt Foot"" I don't know what the heck he doin
But, the way you gotta do the ""Mudd Foot""
You gotta just kick it, it gotta be like flowin y'know?
It gotta be flowin!
I know everybody from Uptown, by the Apollo, Uptown

{*beatboxes*}

I'm the original B-I-Z
The Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E
Everywhere I go, I always G
I'm thinkin somethin that you never could see
Doin the beatbox and the R-A-P
That's why I'm the Inhuman Orchestra, Biz Markie
I'm here just doin my J-O-B
So I can reach the T-O-P
As soon as I get to the T-O-P
Then I will be D-O-N with the E
I rock New Jersey and N.Y.C
Whether it's at a club or a block party
To my man Capri, Starchild and Brucie Bee
{?}, Baby J, and DJ Marty
The title of the song in the place to be
Is not this or that, it's ""Me Versus Me""

{*Biz Markie beatboxes*}
Me versus me

I think it's time to act up and throw a fit
Cause I'm rockin to a beat that just won't quit
This is the real thing, not counterfeit
Cause everything you hear, I'm doin it
The name of a baseball glove is a mitt
And what I need on my BMW is a kit
A preacher preaches from a pulpit
And my man Benny Hill, got a lot of wit
The rhymes that I say are the ultimate
And the way out anywhere is called an exit
A real short play is called a skit
And New Balance sneakers are legit
The past tense for bite, is called a bit
Everywhere that I go, all attention I get
I used to live by the North conduit
The Biz Markie will always make a hit!


This is one thing, that I like to say
This is a different kind of rhythm and rap display
I'm not Frankie Crocker or Lamarr Renee
Cause both of them are radio DJ's
Otis Redding be sittin by the dock of the bay
I'm bound to wreck your body to the break of day
And if you wanna see me at a show, you gotta pay
Cause if you don't you will have, a little delay
Zip-de-doo-dah, zip-de-day
I'm the S-K the B-I-Z the Emezah-A-R-K
And even if I'm buggin on out, around the way
You'll never see me drinkin Tanqueray
Swan, G. Rap, Kane, Shan and Shante
Always been down with the capital J
I got a homeboy by the name of Dr. Bombay
My favorite color - is GREY!  Uhh

I can't forget I like reggae
I'm Biz Markie, and my DJ
C-double-O-L V to the break of day
Hold up, bricka-bricka-bay
Rockin to the rhythm, to the break of day
The original B-I-Z, the Emeza-Emeza-A
Best to sing, and appointed rap king, to the break of day
Everywhere I go I like break your way
And it don't matter to me, as long I give you a display
Zip-a-dee-do-dah rock the microphone and you say
The king of romance will like break your day
I'm Biz Mark, I'd like to say okay
And my favorite drink is called OJ
Hippin to hop then to break your way
Listen to me as I rock and I, say okay
To my man Rud and Superlover Cee ay
I rock to the rhythm and oh say okay
Can't forget my man, G-A, U-L
Hold up - it don't matter to me I rock swell
Hold up - you know it's, me, the
Original B-I-Z, the Emeza-A-Rrah-K-I-E
The original with the material and the ladies always know
I'm bound to wreck in like a Lincoln, always steal a show
To kick it with swing, to rock the thing, ha-heh-ha-ha-ha-hee
Known to me as the original B
It don't matter long as I say stuff you see
Kickin records of a rap technique and..
.. down to wreck your body, your moms be freakin

I Hear Music,The Biz Never Sleeps,1989,"One two, one two
You're listenin to the grand groovin sounds
Of the diabolical energetical B-I-Z
Emmezah-A-Rrrah-K
And this goes out to my DJ
The cutmaster that no one cuts faster than
C-double-oh-L V
Drumroll V

It's a different kind of sound that's in the air
It's not shots, firecrackers, or a car that's there
A little different noise for your listenin pleasure
A sample from a record that's a four bar measure
Adults think this music is just a big headache
They think all this hard work, is just a piece of cake
They must be buggin, right out of they socks
Why don't they get up and try to do, the human beatbox
Cause back in the days when there was just block parties
A DJ would set up his equipment, and start these
Live performances, and DJ tricks
A lot of different DJ's was on the mix
It is a proven fact, music is a universal language
From the tip of Long Island to the Verrezano Bridge
We won awards and served them by the millions
The more more years go by, the more we be killin 'em
They said it's just a fad, it will never last a year
All of a sudden, ten years later - ""I hear music""

Cool V, give me a drum roll

I can't believe how hip-hop has progressed
With more and more groups that have finesse
We have groups on the East and West coast with different names
We all play a part if we didn't we'd go in flames
We all got to stick together as one
But at the same time, still have fun
Cause you don't wanna lose the love for the music
When you have it keep it, and make use of it
This is a lesson from the S-K Biz
Cause nobody else is gonna tell you like it is
Everyone thought that rap was just a phase
But it still continue, to muse and amaze
It gives people chance to show they true talents
Instead of submittin to the crime and violence
People said to me the S-K-B
Is rap gonna stay until infinity?
As long as me and V be makin up the beats
You will hear people sayin - ""I hear music""

Cool V, give me a drum roll

This is the ending, conclusion, kapiche?
Of this new hip-hop masterpiece
About people countin chickens before they're hatched
Recollatin on somethin that they can't match
They're creatin sounds of a hip-hop human bein
Whether you're American or European
Or even if you're from the West or East coast
I'd like to thank all of you, save the most
Don't diss each other by sayin who's better
Just do it the best way, and stick together
With different rhyme techniques and DJ cuts
And be crazy ambitious, and have a lot of guts
And the people buyin, thanks for your support
Cause if it wasn't for you, we'd all fall short
As long as there's radio, cars and jeeps
You know what you will hear?

What, what?  What, what what what what?
Yo V, yo yo what what what what what what what you hear?
I can't hear you man, scratch it up one mo' time!
Yo what you hear?
Yo Paul Sea, yo yo, what wha-what you hear?
Yo Godfather D, I ain't hear what he said, what you hear?",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-i-hear-music-lyrics

The diabolical is back again
But now I want the Killerforce Connection
And we gonna do it in harmony like this
We're the Killerforce MC's
The best in New York city
So let us put it to perfection
While we change it to the Biz Mark connection
Other crews in this section always try to ban the connection
They got together and they combined
Tried to hurt us from time to time
But it didn't work.. as you see
The Biz Mark is in the place to be
So come on party people, get into the groove because-
Biz Markie is gonna bust the mood
Biz Markie.. hey that's me
You know that I body rock to the T-O-P
And I'm the born sureshot you can't resist
I'm gonna take your girl with my sweet kiss
And he's TJ Swan that's his name
And if you're rockin to the beat, I'm the blame
I got the power to get you up off the wall
And get you on the floor, so you can have a ball
The cut master Cool V
He is the man that's at the top of the key
Of course he is fast you know that he is slick
So many fly girls jumpin on his dick

Alone Again,I Need a Haircut,1991,"I was on my way, to 125th
I saw this def Benz, yo that's my man Cliff
As I flagged them down, he pulled to the side
At this moment I had to swallow my pride
Cause usually I wouldn't ask for a lift
But it was cold as hell, and my legs was stiff
He said, ""Hey Biz, what you want, a ride?""
I said, ""Hell yeah,"" he said, ""I can't cause my girl's inside""
So he jetted off, leavin two tracks
Not at one time did homeboy look back
It took me an hour, to get where I was goin
And to top it all off, it had to start snowin
My sneakers was old, and my coat was thin
But my determination kept me goin within
I had nobody to help me as you can SEE..
I'm alone again, naturally
Alone again, naturally
So I went into the show, and started maxin
People came up to me, and started askin
Whassup wit me, and when I'm gettin on
And how many records is Shante gonna perform
I don't know, but now I gotta go
Cause Shante is callin me to do the show
First she was on, and then she called me out
I did a lot of funky beats without no doubt
I put the mic on my head, and began to riff
The crowd began to flip, cause I was rockin the shift
When we was done, I started to laugh
Massive people come to me for my autograph
After the funk was over it was time to break
If I was rhymin it would be the icin on the cake
As I saw Shante, get into a limo
I had to walk home, I wrote it in my memo
I'm alone again, naturally
All alone again, naturally
Now I'm a-ight, nothin to worry
Wherever I wanna go, I get there in a hurry
That's right I'm big time, very well known
Now I'm sayin rhymes instead of beats on the microphone
Right about now, I'm gonna explain
It was Cool V, TJ Swan and the Big Daddy Kane
Doin shows all together, as one group
None of us actin big headed, or souped
Then after that, we all formed a block
I paid everybody, told them how they rocked
They all grabbed they props, and when they seperate
Swan said, ""I'll see you later Biz, in a couple of days""
When people see me leave, like a mamma-jamma
It's like if I was swoll with stars lights and glamour
But when Vaughn came home, he thought I was in somewhere
With a girl was in bed.. nah..
Alone again, naturally
I'm alone again, naturally

Ah-h-h-hm
Ah yeah
Now check it out
I would walk into the bathroom to take a crap
I sit down, and then I write me a toilet stool rap
Whether I'm constipated or have diarrhea
I always come out with a funky fresh idea
Even if you don't think it's funky fresh, and
To all the little kids I'm makin a good impression
Cause a lot of my hits are written on the john
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
This's a hidden secret where classics come from
Everybody has done it, even my man Run
Only in there I am the king of the throne
Hey, hey, you know I can't be alone
No girls, no guys, no dogs, no cats
No parents, no nieces, no nephews, no brats
That's the only way that I can get privacy
And you know where I write my funky fresh rhymes live, you see...
Me sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo...
Yo, bust it
Let me tell you a little something bout this episode
It was four in the morning, chillin on my commode
It was me, my pad, and pen, and my bad breath
All of a sudden I came up with somethin that was real def
I was thinkin, what a real beatbox could do
What if I put a hype beat with the ""p-pf 1-2""?
Then I write some words, so I really can use it
I think I would name this one Make The Music
Like 
if I was the man that they call Clark Kent
Cause I go into the bathroom for rhymes I invent
Then I come out on stage like Superman
But never show the people my masterplan
Instead of movin towels, or movin vowels
Only think I'm doin, is movin bowels
A tv in the bathroom just might spoil it
Only thing I can say is...
I'm sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap

What Comes Around Goes Around,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Goes around
What comes around goes around
Sittin here reminiscin back to high school
Wwhen everytime I see you, girl, you know that I drool
Day-dreamin in class thinkin what would I say
When I saw you, but you never looked my way
It started freshman year and lasted straight to the 12th grade
I have to give it to you, though, you was top-shelf, babe
I asked myself time and time again: what was it
About me that made me treat me like a buzzard
I speak to you in the hall and you ignore me
You keep walkin and talkin like you never saw me
You didn't have to conversate with me, I can say that
It woulda made my day if you just had waved back
I used to buy you candy, lollypops and gum drops
I even pack a extra-sandwich in my lunch box
You're treatin me like dirt and everyone in the school knows
You call me out my name and crack jokes on my school clothes
If anyone could make you feel good, girl, I could
But you give me that look like you don't wanna be bothered
But that's okay, just keep on frontin, see
Cause one day I'mma make it, and you'll be wantin me
Been tryin hard ever since I graduated
To make it big, and yes, I finally made it
Been doin shows, videos and tv
Now everywhere you go everybody knows me
Now the tables have turned and now it's me you're hawkin
Now I turn up my nose, and keep on walkin
You see, ladies marvel me in clubs frequently
And you make it your duty to come and speak to me
Rememberin how she played me in the past
Yeah, we can talk, I'm in a rush, please make it fast
And we can start off with all the men you been with
And don't come poppin that just-a-friend bit
Remember how you used to diss me and play me out, how
Come you got so much stuff to talk about now?
The word's around town that you're on the money tip
But sorry, I can't do nothin for ya, honey dip
So pardon me as I make my way to the dancefloor
And over to the bar because that's what I came for
Cuties pamperin me with champagne and roses
As I think to myself: thank God for showbiz!
Everywhere I turn girlies throwin me rhythm
Drinkin and thinkin who will be my victim
Here comes that girl that used to diss me
She whispers in my ear could she come home with me
Yup, get your coat and we could shoot north
Took her to the crib, and cold knocked her boots off
After i got it, yo, I never did call back
Thinkin how she used to front like she was all that
It's a new game, and the odds are in my favor
She caught the vapors and nothin could save her

Romeo and Juliet,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Romeo, Romeo, wherefor art thou?
That's what Juliet asked, but I don't know now
Maybe he went to get some roses for you
Yo, I'da I'da I-don't know where he's at Ju-li-et
Don't regret, cause he will be back
To come and get you, and bring you to the crillzab
But, there's an obstacle that's in his way
I think it's the-the-the ? that won't decay
Well, I'm the B-I-Z-M-izza-A-R-K
Let me tell you what I hear most people say
That you two people are a part of life
It explains why Romeo died by the knife
Or was it - the poison on Juliet lips
Or vice versa I don't know it make my mind flips
Whichever way it was, it's very educational
So look at the movie and listen cause it's sensational
And if you hear the music you could never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing a long, now come on now
	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 4X)
To the R-O-M-E-O, and the J-U-L-I-et
I think the thing he did was to get respect
The way that I see it, it was a great deed
Because if wasn't, he wouldn't succeed
At getting Juliet's heart, and loving care
And all of the moments they had to share
But I really want you just to check out the plot
Of the movie it is groovy it will hit the spot
It will make you laugh, it make you cry
And that's when you know you will be satisfied
Cause you know I wouldn't tell you nuthin that wasn't right
Cause the Diabolical is outta sight
Yo, Romeo and Juliet should be household names
They names should be in the hall of fame
With my funky beat, you can never go wrong
I want EVERYBODY sing this song, now bust it out now
	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)
	Romeo, Romeo, HAH!!
	Romeo and Juliet get-tin bu-sy (repeat 3X)
	Romeo, Romeo, HAH!!",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-romeo-and-juliet-lyrics
Take it From the Top,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Huh?
Yo this is funky!
We gon' get down to the point
And I'm just gonna say - I'd like to thank my man Rashad
But we gon' get down like this, and you don't stop
A twink-twinkle, a rock the house
And my man Diamond Shell, a rock the house
Can't forget my man Sal, rock the house, and
Felle Fel, rock the house
I can't forget, Capital, rock the house
My man Capital T, will rock the house
And to my man B, a rock the house, and
My man Frankie, a rock the house
I can't forget Doo G, rock the house
And my man Cool V, a rocks the house y'all
Ah to the beat y'all, you don't stop
I'm Biz Markie with the funky sound
And right about now, here's the countdown
One.. two.. one, two, three

Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo B take it from the top
Yo B take it from the top (wellllllll)

Well I demand respect, so everybody salute
And by the way Backspin, is my attribute
You may or may not, know who I am
But frankly my dear.. I don't give a damn!
You may know me from ""Rockin' With Biz Markie""
Or Shante, when she used to battle Sparky
You might have seen in some videos with other folks
Sittin on the bench while me and Biz was tellin mother jokes
The meaning of my name some people may, try to guess
Yes yes I'm fresh to the flesh, so let me manifest
I make romance, I'm not a freelance
I spin records; BITCH I don't breakdance!
I scoop girls around the world that's what B does
The name Backspin means that B was
Born.. as a creative, cut king
Supreme poet, inferior to nothing
Call me the teacher, since I'm the one who taught you
(What's that?) Myyyyyyy DICK! (CAUGHT YOU!)
I'm signin off because my rhyme's complete
I say peace to Chancellor Avenue and Bergen Street

Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Cap take it from the top
Yo Cap take it from the top (wellllllll)

Well get a grip and, yeah the Capital's rippin
More than just a ordinary style, cold flippin
Those that attempt to diss, or try to take this
Title away what? I think you better forget it
Pit-pat this Jack, get off of the crack black
It's the true fact, your record hit the pillow sack
And now you're wonderin how make a comeback
But don't make me laugh, your studio's a two-track
Biz hits the bassline, then I rip the real line
Together it's combined and designed to a master rhyme
A little touch from Cool V himself
An overnight process then it's ready for the shelves
Perfect shit on wax is made
Then bring it to the radio and let it get played
There's no joke and only time to get fanatical
So listen up or pay attention to the Capital
I'm done with the rhyme for the time, so you can have 'em
Aiyyo guys, why don't you throw somethin funky at 'em

Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Shell take it from the top
Yo Shell take it from the top (wellllllll)

Y'all know me, as the Original D
Like to the I say with the A and hey
Bust this, M-O-N-D
I grab the mic and recite rhymes in your left ear
It's always def and different
Never somethin from the previous years
I'm quite slim, but rougher than a pair of Timbs
The Diamond Shell will never trip stagger fall or bend
I don't smoke and never ever have I drank no liquor
Bein smooth keeps my rhyme style, that much quicker
So yo hey chief, bust this technique of speak
I'm feelin sheik and also rather unique
I'm smooth as (?), you can't deny I'm
Innovative with style, and bound to hit primetime soon
As I tour from Kalamazoo to the moon
Give props to the rapper, the brother dresses Dapper
Than Dan cause I'm the man I'd like to make ya toes tap
With the, funky type of flow, I'm smooth as a Lambo'-
-Ghini I dream of Jeannie her hands on my jam
So, once but not twice, this brother's precise
When it comes to snakin girls I get as crooked as loaded dice
Pullin women can't no man compete
I nut 'em all from the Great Wall down to Wall Street
So..

Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top (sayyy whaaaat?)
Yo Fell take it from the top
Yo Fell take it from the top (wellllllll)

Ready for the riot I rip rap rapacious
Crews don't slip you're payin penalty slashes
Clashes crashed, but I crash ass or
Ravish the mic, and then I'mma pass all
Hard to handle run a gamble like Vegas
But I never lost the force be runnin wages
Of pages, and pages, biters think I'm cajun
Spice cause I'm so nice and eighteen is my age is
Rappers crumble when I tackle they crackle I ramshackle
Don't even know why they waste time on the pack'll
Of nine cause my rhymes do 'em in like rifles
Stress the word, so you know I live trifle
MC's, metamorphosize to digest
Days from a faze and my praise is like a rajah
I reckon, that crews that step over this way
Think life is a game and they just too pissed to play
Some say, on mics I'm a master
A snatcher, a catcher, a very well matcher
But crews better know that I hit like after
Effects who's next I wreck from now til then
And then when the then comes, I'mma go hit again
Like rat-a-tat-tat of the tickedy eatin dick-er whore
So every move I make I make sure, it's riggydiggyraw
Biz

Mar, kie the original
Everytime I see V, yo I got material
I was just kickin funky records for you
Cause I'm down with the rhythm of a, ah one chk two
Singin, on records, I get respected
It don't matter to me cause you know that I'm connected
With B-M-V Biz Mark and Vaughn
Down to wreck collect and then jet, to the break of dawn
Discombobulate, sentence ain't complete
Unless I go {*beatbox*} AHH AHH AHH UHH {*cough*} on beat
Zip-zop-a-zigga-lah, zagga-zucka-zaii
No matter what I say, I always come out fly
Because my records get respected as I like jettin
You will agree it's me, cause you know I'm inventin
A different kind of rhythm of rhymin state
That's why you like everything I create
""Pickin' Boogers"", ""The Vapors"", ""Just a Friend""
That's just some of the things you can comprehend
So just check it, MC's wreck it
You listen to the Biz Markie, don't disrespect it
Just listen!",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-take-it-from-the-top-lyrics
Buck Wild,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Hey I'd like to tell you a little story
About my man named Dee
Yo, even from when he was little
He was like kinda on a tough tip
Doin all that stuff
But, I'mma tell you the way..
.. it should really go like..
.. the way he would say it now check this out
When I was young, he always dreamed of bein rich
But compared to then, that'd been a big switch
Drivin big cars, wearin rings and ropes
But man without a plan all he had was hopes
So he sat down, and thought, what he wanted to be
But it seems, no occupation had appeal to Dee
He didn't wanna be a doctor, he don't like school
It wasn't that he was dumb, he just thought he was too cool
Cause all the moneymakers and the big-time crooks
He never ever seen NONE of them carryin books
He used to be on the block, do whatever they pleased
Never had a nine to five, but STILl clocked G's
Harold Reuben, Freewood Ave would make a man of them too
And he thought, yeah that's the life, he wanna do like they do
So he start to flip and cut class with the big boys
Take other kids toys, cause he didn't dig noid
He'd rather run the block and watch the hustlers play
And he'll say, he wanna be just like that one day
He used to run in the stores, steal cookies and candy bars
Watchin the pimps roll by in they fancy cars
But never did the thought even pass
At the time, he 'posed to have his behind in class
So when report cards came, all he received was a F jack
And he got his neck smacked, for cold gettin left back
But yet and still, he didn't care
Cause to him, school's for the birds so he didn't belong there
When he was only eight he hung out with the pros
And he went, from stealin candy, to boostin clothes
He used to dip out the class, go straight to the mall
And he'll take, ANYTHING from anybody at all
His neighbors used to ask his mother ""Brown what's WRONG witcha child?
He done ROBBED my damn house again, yo that kid is buck wild..""
Yo, I don't know whassup, but he be BUGGIN word up
Yo that yo.. I'm just sayin like this
I don't whassup, but
I think you will understand a little bit more of the situation
I'mma say like he would say it, on this second part
So just check this out aight?
Just kick it one two three, go head, go head man, go head
He was a crook -- at the age of nine
Do whatever it took -- he'll ROB YOU BLIND
Snatchin pocketbooks, robbin blind ol men
Way back WHEN.. when he was only ten
Then when he was in 5th grade, he carried a switchblade
Tried to stay rich to keep him and his bitch paid
And if he ever had to travel somewhere far
Take a bus? PSSH - HE'D GO STEAL HIM A CAR!
He'd always choose to live his life the wild way
Tag?! Russian Roulette is what he'll play
His moms and pops told him when he first reached Junior High
The way you live determine just how soon you die
And he didn't care because to him it was fun
And he was only THIRTEEN when he got his first gun
He robbed stores and did stick-ups frequently
Gave a new name to juvenile delinquency
And yeah you know that, he, was on the go
Seven days of the week, he kept his pockets full of dough
But he was headed for a dead end fast
Cold riskin his ass for petty cash that didn't last
Went back and forth to jail six times
For stolen cars and stick-up and various crimes
So when he sit in his cell, he reminisce as a child
It don't pay to do crime today, so don't be buck wild..
Ay that that that's a little bit of a lesson
For all the kids out there you know now
Yeah yeah yeah you know what I'm sayin
And this is comin from
The Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler
Ain't no one cooler
In 7th grade I had a teacher named Mr. Dulah
Who used to wear his pants up to his chest
And I want you to just listen
Cause.. this is no joke, so don't be buck wild..",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-buck-wild-lyrics
On and On,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Maaaan, this is the last.. record on the album

Squig Love is in the house
Cool V on the vocal, gettin me mad
But I'm gonna lil' do a lil' somethin like this
Check this out
One.. two.. one, two, three
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Non-stop rappin to the break of dawn
I'm the Biz Mark, and I'm a sure shot
All of a sudden, you you you you..
I got a friend by the name of Charlie
Charlie got a wife by the name of Dolly
Dolly and Charlie got a son named Wally
And Wally got a girl by the name of Polly
Polly got a sister by the name of Molly
Molly and Polly got a mother named Holly
Father named Arthur, we call him Artie
You don't understand and I'm very very sorry
Cousin named Freida, Uncle named Skeeter
He's married to my fine Aunt Rita
Who is the leader, of the merry cheaters
So, I don't greet ehr cause my Uncle don't need her
Grandma Joyce, drives a Rolls Royce
Of the family I'm a favorite choice
Buddy named Homer, used to be a loner
Now he got a girl by the name of Mona
Now that Homer's marries to Mona
All he does all day is bone bone bone her
Partner named Lex, get big respect
Drivin in his black 300 Z-X
Week after next, when Lex his get check
Me and Lex will be chillin in the X
My girl Eleanor, went to the drugstore
To get deoderant, I figure for sure
Cause the one she used before made her underarms sore
And that's why Eleanor, don't use it no more
Her girl named Betty, who used to go with Freddie
Asked me was I ready, for us to go steady
I told Betty, I wasn't ready
To go steady, cause it would hurt Freddie
A girl named Glen, she's my best friend
Known her ever since who knows when
And do you comprehend, the message that I send
Of family and friends of Grandpa Ben
Like this like that like that like this
You know the Biz Mark's on top of the list

'Member when they had a place called Shanendoah?
Shanendoah, and St. Noah

You will agree it's me, cause I rock a funky beat
The, oh-riginal B, I-Z-M-A-R
K-I with the E, are a superstar
They are I am me, is it because I
Know how R-A-P, no, I think it's deep
Cause my DJ Cool V is a rockin
And a guaranteed to rock and be always clockin
So listen to the hyper, MC fifer
Is it because, yo, I'm not the type of guy
That know how to make a B-I-Z-M-A
R-K-I-and you know that the rhymes fly
Now I go on, zest and sing
Man appointed rap king make the 'phone sing
I'm Biz Mark, the microphone king-er
Down to wreck your body, super-educated
Like swinger of a rap, make your hands clap
Soon to adapt; hey - say, oh Jack
With the rhyme of the MC time
Will agree it's me, Aries is my sign
So is Cool V, nine-teen
Down to wreck your body and on the scene
We went to the fight with Foreman/Holyfield
All of a sudden, we saw a shield
Of girls comin round with the MC sound
Will agree it's me, (??) just around
Just listen to the S-K-V
And ain't another MC messin with me
Even though I got my haircut, down to wreck your body
And make all your girls shake your butt

KISS and 'BLS'n I got the profession of

The lesson with the rhyme of a MC time
Will agree it's me, Aries is my sign
I said that say once, I'm not a dunce
It don't matter to me, nu-ance
Was a per-fume, go and consume
Is it because I'm Biz and I'm in a room
Just (??) to my vocal, I'm not a local
I'm Biz, you can call me a yokel
I'm not from California, I'm not from Kansas City
I'm not not part of the itty titty bittie
Committee with the rhyme, you will agree it's me
The original, M-U-D, D-F-double-O-T hey it's me
Ahh, ahh, P-E-C-E-E
I spell it wrong goin on
To the break of dawn, word is bond
It sound kind of funky, don't it Kevin?
'Member when me and you used to go to 7/11
.. when Shelton worked there?
He used to give us food, and he was fair
Not because we was on the wel-fare
Just because we were down, and we didn't care
But now I'm a millionaire makin my rap
And I'm freakin that dance, make your hands clap
Now are, you, gonna keep the vocal

I Told You,I Need a Haircut,1991,"This is for those who didn't believe
That me, myself they said I couldn't achieve
My goal or even get to my destiny
To be the S-K-B-I-Z
It was a rough road, for me to pursue a
Career in rap to make you say hallelujah
For those who did, I'm not talkin to you
Cause I couldn't be there with-out you
Everytime I see you they always say
I knew you was gonna make hits someday
But then when I was strugglin hard, word
A peep of help from them was never heard
I always knew that, I was gonna make it
No matter how much beef and aggravation I take it
And if you try to hold back me and my crew
Remember, I told you..
I told you..
I'ma give you one incedent from my past
When I had short money, goofy pants off my ass
I used to go to block parties my cousin had served
And see how people who made it, kicked OTHERs to the curb
And then I said if I was in their spotlight
I would treat everybody, equally right
To get where I'm at now, I used to hand out flyers
From school to school, for New York and L.I.ers
It was me and Mike from Ike and then they used to do it
He said if you wanna be like them you gotta keep to it
So I kept at it, cause it was hard work
I told em I was makin a record, they gave me a smirk
Like if I was incapable of doin the deed
Or virtually impossible for me to succeed
You must be crazy if I wouldn't pursue
Only thing that I can tell you is I told you..
I told you..
Now now now this is how it's endin
Just like any other story, it is splendid
I said to Ty if you let me come out with a cut
They will never ever stop shakin they butts
So I came out with ""Make the Music With Your Mouth Biz""
An introduction to me, and told it like it is
Some said it was beginner's luck, with this record
Then I showed em with ""Nobody Beats the Biz"" and got respected
I threw em off with my song ""Pickin Boogers""
It was acquired taste, for different kind of sugars
I got international like twin skyscrapers
With my album ""Goin' Off"" and my single ""The Vapors""
Since I produced my own, they said it would end
Cause it took a year and half to come out with ""Just a Friend""
It went platinum, my album went gold
Altogether it was one point five records sold
So don't EVER try to hold back me and my crew
Only thing that I can say is, I told you..
I told you..
So when anybody try to, mess with your head
Just go for what you wanna go for in life, aight? Chill",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-i-told-you-lyrics
Road Block,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Yo Doc, drop the beat in!
This is a incident that always occur
With the opposite sex, other word is her
No matter what nationality color or creed
Or wherever you at, there's always a bad seed
They're always talkin about wantin to be alone
You're spendin too much time witcha friends, all night long
I'm sayin yo what the heck, I am single
It's no reason why I shouldn't try to mingle
So I met this girl by the name of Maxine
Her breath didn't stink she used Listerine
She looked crazy a-ight, and the whole nine
But this situation was one of a kind
Because I wanted her.. all to my own
So I called her on, my Mickey Mouse telephone
I said, ""Hello pretty momma it's the guy you just me
Uhh what are you doin tonight?""  She said, ""Nuttin,"" I said, ""Bet""
So when I went to pick her up, I was in shock
Cause she brought her friend along for a ROAD BLOCK
	
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	Is it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?
	No I think it's because I have the R-A-P
	I think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY
	Yo I think all the girls is funny..
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
(Yo Biz you know you don't usually be with things like that
Why you let her get away with that?)
I thought she was buggin just to see what I'd say
I said nuttin, let her friend come anyway
Okay now listen what she wanted me to for her friend
(What she want Biz?)  Expected me to pay her way in?
It's not like kid from stingy cheap or my name's Ebenezer
But I'm here to please Maxine, not to please her
So I still let it go by, and got her in the movie
Thank the Lord I bumped into my cousin named Cool V
I said please Vaughn, take her friend off my hands
So I can be alone, and get my man
He said alright I'll introduce, she act like she was wit it
But when we try to split, she looked and said forget it
I don't know whassup Vaughn, she must be buggin
I thought you was in the way she was kissin and huggin
Soon as I said - wanna make music like Sebastian Bach?
I'm not leavin my friend with a guy but it's another road block
	
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Why you do it to MEEEEEE?
	Is it because I'm the BIZMARKIE?
	No I think it's because I can R-A-P, no
	I think you think I'm UGLY makin CASH MONEY
	All of this is funny..
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
	AMERICAN WOMAN!  Stay away from MEEEEEE!
So I was highly upset, and you would be too
If an icicle's in your way, stickin to you like glue
I mean it's the end of the night, time to move on
I'm tryin to kick ballistics so she'd come to my home
I went to, yo bust it, call her when you get to your crib
She said, no and started cryin like a baby with a bib
Now why you wanna bat me up and ruin my night?
I coulda said no but I was bein polite
She tried to pull the I'm stayin over her house bit
Not tonight baby you gon' be stayin at a Parkway Exit
So they went into the bathroom to get in a huddle
If you keep playin you're both gonna take the shuttle
They both came out the bathroom with a glance
Like the bathroom they were goin to dance
They both approached me with the look of a rock
I look and tell my senses ahh it's another road block..",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-road-block-lyrics
Busy Doing Nuthin’,I Need a Haircut,1991,"I was sittin home, all alone
When I heard the ring, on my telephone
I picked it up, to see who could it be
This girl I just met, her name was Tammy
See I was surprised, cause she called me first
She was one of the baddest in the universe
I was just buggin cause she gave me a ring
It was a Monday, and it started off with a bang
She start the conversation over how was your weekend
I did this that and the other with my friend Monique
And Shaneeda, (She need a new hairdo?) We both laughed
How you long you gonna be home?  I gotta take a bath
So I gave her two hours then I called her back
You know I was ready, when I rolled a headcrack
Cause when I asked, can I?  She cut me off so tough and
I gotta call you back - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN

Let me tell you a story bout a girl named Gilda
She was from out of state, I was wonderin will the
Same thing happen to me like the deja vu
Let me keep quiet, and go into a tale
See I was chillin at the Chapter 3
Word is bond she looked divine, she looked as fly as can be
I thought she was different cause she was by herself
She looked real wholesome, and in good physical health
I walked by, she said hi
Ain't you the B-I-Z-the-emmaza-emmaza-A-R-K-I
I said yes can I have the number to your home
Are you allowed to call Jersey on your phone?
She chuckled we exchanged, I went home joked about it
How she was gonna be mine, with no doubt about it
But everytime I call I say whassup muffin?
I'm doin somethin now - aww baby, you busy doin NUTTIN
Chorus

Ahhhh, don't give me that!
The last episode was at a club in the Bronx
I was rockin with Capri who got a good response
It was Backspin June, and Limo Driver Mike
You chill in the car, cause clubs he didn't like
So me and V went in just to look around
Seein girls that had bass with sense around
Then we all got on stage and rocked the house
There were no fights in, not even out
Slide, then we got in the car
Saw two trillzadills shinin like a star
One was with Mike, the other was with June
Yo it's not gonna be theirs for soon
So V got with Mike and hooked me with her sister
If I knew she was like that, I woulda had dissed her
Cause everytime me and V called them both up and
They both were busy?!  Nah - they're busy doin NUTTIN
Chorus 3X

Ahhhh, don't even give me that!
That's junk
This goes out to all you bitches doin nuttin
Ka-ka-cause that's all you be doin
Am-am-I right B, am I right Doc
Am I right Shell, am I right V
Am I right am I right Sahai, am I right ?
They don't be busy doin NUTTIN
They go nowhere fast and then go backwards
With Bart Simpson in the background
All of a sudden roll like they got shot by the Apollo though
Word up, I didn't even.. okay
Bblabaldblablballl, ah!!",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-busy-doing-nuthin-lyrics
Kung Fu,I Need a Haircut,1991,"Once about a time there was a kid
Who didn't have a bicycle or a car that skid
Only thing he had was Pat and Turner
He didn't know the future but the lesson to learn-ah
Way to get started in the music biz
Just listen to the story as I tell it like it is
I was a youngster from East Junior High School
Who thought somebody with Adidas sweat-shirt was cool
It symbolized somethin, but I don't know
I wanted to be down really really bad so
I asked one of my best friends Derek Mangareu
""C'mon man can I be down can I be down witcha crew?""
He had one by the name of Masters of Control
I wanted to be down, so I could play the role
He said, ""No you're not good enough we have ours Mark""
I went home and sat in the room with no lights in the dark
And this is gonna be a rough rendezvous
And that's why I sing this song to you
I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong
I got a little older, three years to be exact
When a crew named Midnight Express gave me a crack
It consist of one MC and two DJ's
And the way Kevin D cut had me amazed
It was like I just joined the Lakers
Or even Rock Steady or the New York City Breakers
I was in 11th grade, at ?? High
They was sayin they was sayin hey what's wrong with this guy
Because all he do, is bang on tables and mumble
And doin music with his mouth like a band ensemble
Or the human beatbox wasn't thought about
And the teachers they thought I was crazy without a doubt
I guess they didn't understand what I was comin from
Since I was into MC'n, they thought I was dumb
Then there was a teacher by the name of Ms. K Parke
Since I was good at rememberin numbers she said I was smart
But that don't got nothin to do with this rendezvous
And THAT'S why I sing this song to you!
I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong
I was a walkin son of a gun before the day I begun
I'mma tell you how it started, from day one
Well me, I lived in ]??[, they lived in C.I
I was ambitious and devoted til the day I'd die
I used to get on Fair Islip, take the S-42
Get off at Bunanan Street, and go to the house of the crew
I would walk from C.I., to Bay Shore
Just to see if I really had the rhymes galore
I'd go to house parties here, go to house parties there
Walk the ?? ?? pants off my derriere
Like if I was David Carridine who played ""Kung Fu""
Who would walk from China to Japan without a shoe
Hummin beats, sayin rhymes, kept me goin
From givin up or bein crazy, or just stop flowin
My teachers and parents said, I should just stop
Just go to army go to college get a job witcha POPS?!
I can't take no more of this rendezvous
And that's why I sing this song to you!
I'm a lonely soldier.. yeah..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong
I'm a lonely soldier..
Many miles from home..
With a heart that's heavy..
And with.. a will that's strong",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-kung-fu-lyrics
Young Girl Bluez,All Samples Cleared,1993,"""Huh huh huh, now what was I to do?
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue, I said"" - Slick Rick (Repeat 4x)

I was walking down the street, just a minding my biz
I saw this young lady, the ultimate
She had a pair of jugs that was so fine
Then I took a look at that behind
36-24-36, I looked to her and I said ""I need a fix""
I asked her the same blahzay, blahzay
Her name, where she live, and how much she weigh
I got her digits and gave her my 1-800 beeper number
You can leave a message under the name of Rhumba
I know you're bugging off the nickname, I would be too
But every time she be walking, she turns the heads of the crew
Word is bond, I wouldn't be messing
With this girl if I knew she was an adolescent
To all the guys over 21, here's the news:
It's the hip-hop version of the Young Girl Bluez


As the story goes on, I get a little deeper
I got a strange message on my 1-800 beeper
Call me looney, crazy, psychotic or dumb
But I got a good message from a girl named Rum
She said come and get me from Mickey D's at 8
That's where I work after school, pick me up for a date
I was so excited that she called my pager
But never thought to ask if she was a teenager
She mentioned going to school, but I didn't think it was high
If you saw what I saw, then you'd know why
You wouldn't believe or even think of
A bird like that could be a dove
I picked her up in my Lexus coupe
Only God knows what I'm doing is an oof
Am I robbing a cradle? I'm very confused
I'm stuck in the middle of the Young Girl Bluez


Now I was seeing her for about half a year
Everything was fine and dandy without shedding a tear
Age ain't nothing but a number, that's what Chi-Ali said
Okay, then why don't you get that through the judge's head?
Proceeding along, I must have to say
It was coming very close to her birthday
I asked ""What do you want?"" She said ""A pair of earrings""
I never knew what an avalanche the future brings
Her birthday came and she gave a party
I arrived kind of late to the place to be
People was excited for seeing my face
If my mother ever knew, I would be a disgrace
""How old are you now?"" to Rhumba-reen
I was in shock when they screamed ""Sixteen!""
I felt like falling apart when I heard the news
This is the never-ending saga of the Young Girl Bluez",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-young-girl-bluez-lyrics
Hooker Got a Boyfriend,All Samples Cleared,1993,"Aiyyo here's a tale, about a female I once messed with
Or better yet, skins that I swung eps with
Face full of grace, waist shaped like Vanessa Del Rio, oh-me-oh, my but the heffer had
Big juicy lips, wide hips you had to call fat
Stacked back to mack, yo the hooker was all that
And lots more, and baby girl I had the hots for
But I'm really not sure, who she spread the twat for
Heard it was a kid across town named Hector
But I don't give a heck, so I still went and checked her
On the down low, he ain't around so
Out of sight, out of mind, get your coat and let's go
So we dipped, hopped in the whip and we was gone
Off to City Island cause they had it goin on
Two yuks a foo, now the mood was set
Caviar at the bar, Red Star, Moet
Silk suits, spendin loot like a straight up mack
When I felt somebody finger tappin me on my back
And turn around quick, but before I could begin
All I seen was a big mac-10, aiyyo it's her boyfriend

""Hooker got a boyfriend!""
""Why do she do this boyfriend?""
""Ohh ahhh.. why do she do this boyfriend?""

Check it, yo
I broke camp, ran like a champ, yep I jetted
Off to the trunk for the pump, time to set it
Money kept screamin some CRAP that I dissed him
So I started lettin off {*gunshots*} but I missed him
Honey got scared, and called the five-oh
So yo, you know the half Dukes, time for me to go
Cause I ain't the type to be doin no bid
For a dame or a lame-brained punk Spanish kid
So I chill, call the hooker up the next day
She told me come over yo, bet I'm on my way
Be there in a sec, yo I'm not too far
She said, ""Park around the back so he don't see the car""
Met me at the door with a kiss and a smile
I said, ""Sorry about last night, money kinda wild""
""Umm yeah I know, small thing don't worry""
Just show me to your room so we can do this in a hurry
Kissed her from her earlobes down to her chest
Went for the bellybutton and to hell with the rest
Got her butt-naked and before a second passed
I had her on the bed with my fingers up her {ahh!}
Now she's ready, set for a good steady bangin
Until she looked down and seen Moby Dick hangin
She told me, ""Take it easy yo trust me just chill""
Knowin once I get up in it yo I'm goin for the kill
So she spread 'em, thick rich and creamy like mayo
Aiyyo, lay-o, the tip is on the way-o
Pinned her legs back, just about to slide in
When the door burst open {*SLAM*} damn it's her boyfriend!
Did it again!


Now I'm mad, money done spoiled all the fun
On top of that he beefin and he ain't got a gun
Flippin the jibs, I guess he wanted to brawl
So I started hookin all butt-naked and all
Threw a right, caught money dead in the jaw
BOOM with the left and his fronts hit the floor
Now I had him, time to put his head for rest
So I beat him unconcious and I started gettin dressed
Honey all hysterical and screamin all hoarse
Said she seen a box car pullin up in the yard
Just bout to jet, yo guess what I saw
Some old big black {*HMMM*} bust in the door
""Now hold up, what the hell you doin in my house?
Get your ass off the floor, put your teeth in your mouth
Now everybody better be gone by the count of one
Look, better yet, y'all stay right here
I'm goin to get my gun""
Now that's it! Enough is enough, I ain't with it
I'm catchin mad beef and yo I ain't even hit it
Honey looked good and yo the buns was fat
But ain't a coochie in the whole WORLD worth all that
So umm, I got my coat and I was on my way
That's when she started breakin down, and beggin me to stay
Knock it off, it ain't that much beggin in the world
Next time I want some skins, I'll go and hit my own girl
Man I'm out, and I ain't tryin to see you again
So eff you, eff your pops AND YOUR FAGGOT-ASS BOYFRIEND!

I’m An Ugly Nigga (So What?),All Samples Cleared,1993,"Hey hey hey, know what I heard?
Beauty's only skin deep, ugly is to the bone

Back in the days, I'm not gonna lie
They used to say I'm ugly, a hurting guy
They would crack on my lips, and my powder
Saying I look like yuck without the house or ?Wig Howard?
]From junior high to high school they thought I was retarded
Just because the way I looked, they said I farted
I was very very sad and you wonder why
Because my looks and my gear wasn't ultra fly
I wouldn't even attempt to ask a girl out
Cause she get around her friends and began to shout""
""Guess who asked me out to the movies girlfriend
It was Mark, I told him if the world would end""
But my parents told me beauty's only skin deep
If that's true then why do girls think that I'm a creep?
I even joined the football team to get some recognition
But that didn't spark the key in a girl's ignition
They said I'm so ugly I give Anican a headache
Aw man, that is the icing on the cake!
So I kick this to all the girls from houses to huts
I don't care what you think, cause you all are nuts

I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
If you don't like the way I look, you can kiss my butt
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? Ewwwww (Repeat 2x)

I'm a tell you story that's really bugged
About a guy with a Benz and he's dealing drugs
In the begining before he got his riches
He was so ugly, he gave me the itches
I mean, if you see him, you think I might be kooky
But homeboy looked like, um, God-zooky
I used to crack and joke and say he looked like a star
And everybody laughed when I said ""Mon-star""
I can't laugh now because it's a new decade
My guzu-friend got the girls and got it made
I guess having jewels, having money, having a vehicle
Makes you sexy, handsome, gorgeous, and adorable
When you're spending money, giving girls what they want
Behind your back they talk about you say you're ugly and you front
Why do you go to bed with someone that you don't like
Just because they got a nice car like Reverend Ike
It would be wrong if he heard what you're thinking
Thinking that he look like, um, Stinking Jenkins
But let me tell you a secret, he has ESP
And this is what he whispered in my ear to me

I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
Just because I got loot, that's why you give me the butt?
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? (Repeat 2x)
Let me tell you how poor I was

Dome to the doo, and doo to the dome
For the dome I go to school and for the doo I use a comb
Now people always ask how are these things known
Cause the dome does the doing for things that are done at home
That's why I keep a pick in my nappy fro
And for lunch I eat Ragu with my sloppy joe
But at night I be starving, like Messy Marvin
I get cheap and go settle for the White Castle bargain
They offer me a lot in the army
But I'd rather get it second hand from the Salvation Army
Cause times are getting harder than boot camp
Man I'm so poor I need to print my face on a food stamp
So if my hooptie breaks down, I just have to suffer
And tell Minekie ""I'm not gonna pay a lot for this muffler!""
So I keep clear thoughts as the weeks run
But even on the beaches, they call me a beach bum
Something ain't right with me, and that really frightens me
Cause nowadays girls don't even like to sprighten me
Some say I'm embarassing, but I got some comparison
Like if I was on TV, I would be Oscar Madison
Is there another like me? Only God knows
Man I should even rap in church cause I wear holy clothes
But for now I'm just going to do the strut
And this is what I say to girls from houses to huts

I'm an ugly nigga, so what?
Just because I'm poor, that's why you won't give me the butt?
I'm an ugly nigga, so what? So what? (Repeat 2x)",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-im-an-ugly-nigga-so-what-lyrics

Yo V, bring it in
Aight, this this a special dedication
To my man DJ Hollywood

And I-I-I'd like I'd like to sing a little song
A little something like this
To all the ladies out there, this goes out to you now
Check it out

Ooooh, whoa-whoa
No wayyyyyyyyy, no wayyyyyyyy

Give you so much lovin, and treat you on

And let's make love tonight
And I swear to you baby, I'll treat you right
If you're the kind of girl that I've been lookin for
Be real good to me baby, let me be adored

Let me here you say welll (welll) - oh well (oh well)
WELLLLLLL-LLLLLLLL-LLLLLLL

Did you ever see a girl, and thought she didn't care
Did you ever feel like cryin, and think you'd get nowhere
Did you ever see her comin, when the lights were down below
Did you ever whisper GOD I LOVE HER, but how much you never know
Did you ever look into her eyes and see a little prayer
Could you sew a spot, flow to her heart
And think that you were there?
Did you ever wonder where she is, or wonder if she's true?
One day you'll be happy
But that next day you'll be blue

That's why I say well (well) - it feels so good to me
WELLLLL (WELLLLL) - you know just how to set me FREEEEEEE
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh
Whenever I see her face (where you goin brotherman?)
I take a trip to a beautiful plaaaaaaaaace
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

Whenever we're up close
It's your perfume I love the mooooooooooost
Say LET ME LET ME LET ME LET ME
LET ME LET ME TURN YOU ON, ooooooooohhhhh

When all the other fellas try to run that game on you
I wanna show you baby a love that's true
A love that's good, and a love that's fine
Somethin to blow your mind
Talkin bout a love of the freakiest kind
Because you got eyes like a-water
Lips so rosey red
Everytime I see you really turns my head
And I'm the kind of guy, that love you all for me
And everybody know my name is (BIZ-MAR-KIE)


Say, well, WELLLLLLLLLLLL
Well, well well welll
Well, well, well!

I’m the Biz Markie,All Samples Cleared,1993,"It's me the diabolical, Biz Mark symbolical
I shakes from scripts of hits I made a while ago
Now I'm on the run again starting other capers
And people couldn't catch me even if I was ""The Vapors""
I leave you in trauma with my funky personna
Cause I'm jamming just like Teddy but I'm nasty like Madonna
Cause me without big strong thoughts for a Biz song
Is like Patty LaBelle not singing with a wig on
I don't give a damn if my record gets panned
Cause my style stays fresh like I rap in Saran
When I'm sure that I'm pure like Snapple
Suppose when I write my rhymes like I'm the Big Apple
Or New York or whatever you call it, I don't even care
Cause if I can make it there, I can make it anywhere
So, I walk the walk through the streets of New York
More green I can hawk cause I can talk the talk
So don't try to stalk cause my style brings more
I rock it from the Billy Ocean to the Al B. Shore!
People always want to give dap to everyone
But I've been around the world so I ahhh ???

""I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king""
""Have the people stomping to my beat you bet""  (Repeat 4x)

Take a pause for the cause, cause this is a recording
If rap was a prison, then I be the warden
I do the Gator in my snakeskin Jordans
And when it comes to cash I flash more than Gordon
You want me to rock the rhyme cause I got the type you crave
And I heat up jams like I was MC Microwave
And when I drop a style, call it def, call it cool
As long as you don't call me when I'm on a toliet stool
I stoke and swin in a room full of women
When I drop the gold like Meadowlark Lemon
Everywhere I've been I've seen 'em fat and thin
Even girls with hair on their chinny chin chin
But you can be just a friend if you're sporting your own look
Or if you got more chins than a Chinese phonebook
Women love my style from ??? Long Isle
Even got my mother singing ""Thanks for my Child""
My temperature rises every time I'm near a stereo
Cause I catch dance fever like my name was Danny Terio
But I go, on and on and on and on and on and!
From midnight point to the early morning, AHHHH!

""I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king""
""Have the people stomping to my beat you bet""  (Repeat 4x)

It's my way or the highway, I'm ahead of the slow lane
But when I ride to Motown I jump on a Soul Train
Rappers like to flow with all energy and action
But I'd rather take it nice and slow like Freddy Jackson
So don't try to stick to me like somebody's gearshift
Cause I'll hit you so far west you'll come back Easter
The style I display, but I say it a badder way
I got more rhymes than cartoons on a Saturday
You're still confused cause you don't know how bad he is
Like a pregnant ______ who don't know who the daddy is
Just like a snap I can whip any rapper
That's why probably my grandparents called me a whipper snapper
You're lost in the sofa trying to cross my line
Then run to the lost and found cause you lost your mind
I'm coming on strong cause I'm dropping nothing soft
Still had it going on when ""The Biz is Going Off""
I'm singing in the rain cause I got the audacity
Or some kids want to sundance with Butch Cassidy
You couldn't shine on my in the spotlight
Cause your ass couldn't shine if you sat on a flashlight

""I'm the Biz Markie, the human beatbox and the rap king""
""Have the people stomping to my beat you bet""  (Repeat 4x)",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-im-the-biz-markie-lyrics
Bad by Myself,All Samples Cleared,1993,"Yeah yeah yeah
Oooooohh
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh, yeah yeah yeah
Let me tell you a story now

I was in front of the Apollo on Amateur Night
It was after the show, and the moon was right
The {?} was really perked off the Red Zone
I was in my MPV, I was all alone
A lot of out-of-town people askin me for
My John Hancock or my signature
I gave it to, all of them cause I was down to earth
And plus the Apollo is my home turf
So I walked across the street 'til I'm on, 125
I saw this pair of shoes that was really live
It wasn't just a pair of shoes, that was on her
From the ground up, she looked like a plate of lasagna
I said, ""Hey shorty, not you, your hair""
She turned around slowly and started to stare
She said, ""Why don'tcha take picture, it'll last a lil' longer?""
Me likin you grew a little bit stronger
She asked me what's my name I said, ""Emmezah emmezah""
""The name that your momma gave ya is what I prefer""
She asked me what am I drivin, and how is my health
I know what you're really thinkin baby, LET ME TELL YOU!

I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that alone
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't tryin to be funny honey

She started arguin with me, and say she's not like that
I know who you are, I don't care if you're livin fat
Because I have a mother and father that take care of me
And I'm livin in Long Island with a J-O-B
Okay okay I got you wrong, I must admit
I'ma give you a little time to see if you're legit
So we started goin out on a regular basis
I was takin her to the movies and my hangout, places
Like the Q Club, The Scene, or The Arcade
I thought this relationship was tailor-made
Cause she was sweet kind considerate I, was hypnotized
Never thought she'd try to pull the wool, over my eyes
After I smacked it and flipped it, she thought I was whipped
I know she is like a knockout but I'm not gettin bullwhipped
She asked me why I am so stingy I know you got the ends
Because you got two MV's, two BM's, an SL Benz
What are you my accountant or the IRS?
Why ya clockin everything that I posess?
She want me to waste everything and be small as an elf
Let me tell you somethin baby, let me tell you

I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I can do that on my own
I can do bad by myself
I don't need no help, to starve to death
I ain't tryin to be funny honey

Now all her friends boosted her, to get my dinero
Like if I was a drunk Mexican, wearin a sombrero
I knew she had a boyfriend on the side
She told me, yo, she didn't have to hide
She said she cut him because he was too jealous
He always thought I was tryin to talk to other fellas
It's now the present, and that was the past
From now on bein with me, is gonna be a blast
I know she thought in her mind, it's gonna be great
Juicin and reducin everything I make
With her Victoria's Secrets neglice
She tried to seduce me in every way
She would come out to Jersey rain sleet or snow
She acted too true blue to be after my dough
My man, Jeff told me but I didn't wanna listen
I was too hooked, and strung out, I thought he was dissin
Then she popped the question, and asked me for some dough
I looked her in her face and said, ""HELL NO!!!""
You're a head nurse and you want my wealth?
You must be CRAZY AS HELL, cause


Let me tell you know
All day long, you been talkin on the telephone
Braggin to all your friends, about all the cars that I own
But YOUUUUUU don't tell 'em, that I'm the one doin it all
While you're out there livin it up, and havin yo'self a ball


Ummm, whoah-whoah, yeah-yeahhhh!

I’m Singin’,All Samples Cleared,1993,"Yo Biz, let's send this out to the propmaster Kool DJ Red Alert
Bring the beat in, Todd
Yeah, this is how we're doing it for the '93, we're on the smooth tip
Ha ha, yo Biz, kick something funky for 'em, word up

Now people always want to know my strategy plan
For me to use the weird name as ""Diabolical Man""
Well I got diabolical beats, raggedy clothes
And aw hell, I'm even wearing diabolical drawers
I'm not White as Barry cauce I'm Dirtier than Harry
With a rap that's big and fat that Mariah couldn't Carey
So don't come to me with that same ol' same ol'
Cause I'll knock your butt somewhere over the rainbow
I write rhymes that jam more than jelly
So call me the Arthur without the Fonzarelli, or Nelly
Cause I am so bad when it comes to a rap jam
Even robins scream, ""Holy hip-hop Biz man!""
I grab the microphone and go every which way but loose
Cause I'm the ugly ducking that seduces Mother Goose
And I don't be using flipping tounge twisters
But I still get better in time like The Whispers
But older crews you see can't stay as loose as me
Cause old school rappers just ain't what they used to be
So up your nose with a rubber hose
And every brother knows that your style's older than my grandma's clothes
But gray skies is going to clear up, so put on a happy face
Take off that frown and chear up, and put on a happy face, cause
	I'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)
	Ah ah ah ah ah
I start with a rhyme as I enter your mind
I hit so hard even Michael Jackson won't remember the time
So here I come a bombing every time I home in to
Off a funky drummer boom I get hot as Donna Summers
Cause I reigh supreme as a rap brainstorm
]From corner to corner, I'm dropping some more on ya
Not Tony Toni Tone, cause I came to warn you
That I even reign in Southern California
Everybody talking bout Biz is hype
Cause I make Dirty Harry's day, hell I even make Gladys Knight's
Soon I star on ABC because rapping DEF is the best way to the G
Alphabetically I have to lead you through
Since I'm the M-izza I know to watch my P's and Q's
Like the EMT's but the B-I-Z
I rap so picture perfect I should just stop and say ""Cheese""
So if I step up, who's gonna move me back?
Cause Scooby Doo can't even do that for a Scooby Snack
You think you can, you think you can, don't even try it
Cause instead you need to can it like the Jolly Green Giant
Cause trying to step to Biz, you know I'm a diss them fast
So play like 98.7 and KISS my ass!
Cause me and rap is like peanut butter and jelly
Which reminds me of a song by my man Gene Kelly
	I'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)
	Ah ah ah ah ah
Now it's the universal languange that the Biz Mark is speaking
I'm down with blacks, whites, Indian, and Puerto Rican
I'm an African descendent, myself would have say
But I was ""Booooorn in the U.S.A.!""
I spent the 80's duking ladies without making babies
So I guess I'm over like a fat rat that never caught rabies
Went from messing around like Tonto with no woman in 3 years
I had one little two little three little indian
B-I-Z Markie is what it is
And if it's hard for you to spell, then just say ""Biz""
I'm down with the Zoo Crew, some kids who act nutty
B-Danks, Cool V, Everett, Todd, and Jeff
They're my buddies, ha, my buddies, ha
Wherever I go, we go
I pass my April Fools in monster May
I pass by so much bull I should say ""Ole!""
I got friends named Raggedy Ann and Andy
Call my ""Bon appetite"" cause I'm sweeter than John Candy
Don't even knock it, till you try me
Cause the proof is in the pudding, you can ask Bill Cosby
Some think I'm bragging, some think I'm boasting
But even Smokey Robinson would second that emotion
That's why I take through the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm fly-ly-ly-ly-ly, ly ly ly ly
	I'm sing-ing-ing-ing in the rain ain ain (Repeat 7x)
	Ah ah ah ah ah",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-im-singin-lyrics
Family Tree,All Samples Cleared,1993,"One two, one two
This goes out to my brother dimond shell
My man jazzy jerome, def jeff
I can't forget my man kevin d and the midnight express crew
Philly, soda pop
I'm gonna run down my family tree like this:

One, two, one two three and
I got a friend by the name of charlie
Charlie got a wife by the name of dolly
Dolly and charlie got a son named wally
And wally got a girl by the name of polly
Polly got a sister by the name of molly
Molly and polly got a mother named holly
Father named arthur, we call him artie
You don't understand then i'm very very sorry
Cousin named frita, uncle named skeeter
He's married to my fine aunt rita
Who is the leader of the married cheaters
So i don't greet her, cause my uncle don't need her
Grandma joyce drives a rolls royce
Of the family i'm a favorite choice
Buddy named homer, used to be a loner
Now he's got a girl by the name of mona
Now that homer's married to mona
All he does all day is bone, bone, bone her
Father named lex, gets big respect
Driving in his dodge 300gx
Week after next, lex gets his check
Me and lex will be chillin' in the x
My girl eleanor, went to the drugstore
To get deodorant, i think it was pure
Cause the one she used before made her underarm sore
And that's why elenor don't use it no more
A girl named betty who used to go with freddie
Asked me was I ready for us to go steady
I told betty that I wasn't ready
To go steady cuz it would hurt freddy
A girl named gwen, she's my best friend
Known her ever since who knows when
And do you comprehend, the message that i send
Of family and friend of grandpa ben
Like, like, like, like, like, like that
Bound to wreck your body
And ana na na na na na na na na na ana
Cool v bring it down",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-family-tree-lyrics
Funk is Back,All Samples Cleared,1993,"Get up out your seat, the grand groove is back
With a beat to sink your teeth in like Wolfman Jack
I'm bringing in the swing like ching a-ling a-ling
Guaranteed to rock and make the microphone sing
I combine funk with a make-a-monk piano
I'm nuts, I'm crazy, I lost it, and man a
Different type of bud in my veign and hey
Like I'm *cookoo cookoo* like a nappy dread
Now it's me, the B-I-Z, M-A-R K-I to the E
As you can see, going to the T-O-O, mo mo most definitely
I concoct to rock, and put you in shock
Not from the past, but I blact like Binac-a
Yeah, the one foots getting ill
Cause nobody beats the Biz still

The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

Ooops, well I'm the original B-I-Z Mark
Here to let you know my bite is worse than my bark
I'm coiming out with some freakified funk
If Joanie was around, then I'd be a hump
But since she ain't, I still am the
Hellified king of the R-A-P
I'sa I'sa I'sa here to let you know
I'm the hypnotizing, mezmorizing, stealing the show
Uh-oh, I'm hitting hitting just like a speaker
My mom dropped the bomb, then God said ""Eureka!""
To say a lay masterpiece that's long overdue
]From the streets of California to Kalamazoo
Don't look at me like I'm crazy or dumb
Cause my jinlge will tickle you cerebrum
My sensational delivery will give you a chill
That's why nobody beats the Biz still

The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

I'm the super, duper, party pooper
With my loop I'll put you in a stupor
Chump, thump, with doctor's bump
With the trunks of funk to make the heartbeat pump
M ah Z R, K har, I har, E har
Try hard, a star, rocking the Casbah
My brain maintains with no restraints
Not John Doe or Jane, here to entertain
Feul a, deuler, plus an old schooler
Funk from the crack keep me kicking like I'm ruler
Dunky, drunky, skunky, funky, and pokey
Chunky, a junkie with the monkey on my back
Knack, opposites attract
Biz being wack? Get the bozack!
Skill to ill, plus always thrill
And I be sure that no one beats the Biz still

The funk is back! (Repeat 4x)

"No Rubber, No Backstage Pass",America Is Dying Slowly ,1996,"Artist: BizMarkie, Chubb Rock, Prince Paul
Album: America Is Dying Slowly
Song: No Rubber, No Backstage Pass
Intro: BizMarkie
C'mon
Break it down
Rarrraaaahahhhh!!
What happened? C'mon!!
What happened?? Ahhrrrahhh!!
Rrrrah!
Now we got me
My man Chubb Rock over this Prince Paul beat
Yo Chubb you start it off we gonna freak it
C'mon
Verse One: Chubb Rock
Here we go
To the consumer, and the kids who drop rumors
For the man who sport, Timberland and dash suede Pumas
I, come backwards on stuff you don't deny
If you try to act fly then I'll, punk you I and I
When, I turn my ducats into Li Pao Yen
The gas from the past of the American friend
With your suits and your squads and your fancy car
Turn to bourgeoise, to invade the media, shame
Take it insult, call me, the Grape Ape
When I flow people gotta see the whole Ricki Lake
Ate, every cuisine and scheme from Jamaica
I like Spike Lee's a kind of sporty 40 Acre
I gotta have it, O.J., he gotta stab it
Stop dealin with that Cato Caelin kid, the drug addict
If you missed me, don't kiss me with the tongue
Soon to come is my man BizMark the one
Verse Two: BizMarkie
La-dah-di, la-dah-da, I like to say
You know me, as the inhuman orchestra
When you first heard me I did MEOW MEOW
Guaranteed to rock and shock and clock and
Oh, I made you say ow yes
You hear me rockin, you hear me clockin
You hear people jockin
Is it because I'm like smart like Mr. Spock and
Captain Kirk and, you know I'm workin
I'm bound to wreck your body, go OWWW, I go bezerk and
You always hearin, you always clearin, you always cheerin
Hey, umm, umm I'm dissapearin like Magic
I'm tragic, all of a sudden
You Gotta Have It like Spike Lee, hey, you know me
As the Uh-riginal B, I-Z, the M, the A
The ickaZarR-Kay, I-E
I'm not diggedy Das EFX but I can mic check it
The original, here to rock and get respected
I'm Markie, heh, the M-ahh-Zay-R-Kay
The man appointed rap King, and I'm here to stay
I'm down to wreck your body, I'm not here to scrub
I gotta pass it over, to my man Chubb
Verse Three: Chubb Rock
From the glass clear era that's the point of the one
Be unique, critique, from the crumb, me neva done
I check them then wreck them let them fall into my spectrum
Then the Punky Brewster kids they, squeeze like rectum
I become monolithic then rip it the remains I sip it
My hat I tip it, cheerio, kid and here I go
Off beat slackin, but the platinum mediocre rappers
With the corporate backers interfused to grab sag actors
The, acoustic suits it, the boys juiced it then boost it
It kinda Gravedigs, well it should, Prince Paul produced it
What about bourgeoise, super star, in unleaded fuel cars
Hangin in bars, talkin the trife squads
Girls buckwild, child, in the rub-a-dub style
Every girl love oh Chubb Rock profile, smile
At the camera point your gluttimus to the man
At the movie star to smack out, with my rubber band
I can tell that, you need me, you don't want me to get paunchy
And me, I don't want to catch no HIV
So we'll protect you, and me but mainly me
If you don't want no rubber then P-E-A-C-E",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-no-rubber-no-backstage-pass-lyrics
The Energy Blues,Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks,1996,"And now, the Energy Blues

Energy
Sometimes I think I'm runnin' out of energy
Seems like we use an awful lot for
Heatin' and lightin' and drivin'
Readin' and writin' and jivin'
Energy, you'd think we'd be savin' it up

Energy, you can get it by dammin' up a river
Energy, a windmill can make the breeze deliver
But even with millin' and dammin'
Our needs are so much more demanding
Energy, we have to use some kind of fuel

Chop, chop, chop, the cavemen used wood to start their fires
Chop, chop, chop, they made all the tools that they required
Chop, chop, chop, inventions got more and more inspired
The fires got higher and higher
And clearings got wider and wider
Energy, they were burnin' 'bout all their wood up

Then one day men discovered that coal would do it better
Miners dug, and it looked like it might just last forever
It seemed like the final solution
It started an Industrial Revolution
Energy, we just keep on diggin' it up

In 1859, way out in western Pennsylvania
A man had built a rig that got some laughs from folks who came there
But then suddenly, a mighty roar came up from the ground
And soon a gusher gushed and soaked all who stood around
Now no-one knew, who that gusher blew
The petroleum years were on us
And that so many cars and trucks would come to cause a crisis
And then!?

Energy, we're looking to try and find some new kind of
Energy , exploring to try and make a new find of
Nuclear and thermal and solar
If we miss we'll get colder and colder
Energy, we've gotta stop usin' you up

So don't be cross when momma says turn that extra light out
Just turn it off till we find us a fuel that never runs out
If everyone tries a bit harder
Our fuel will go farther and farther
Energy, we're gonna be stretchin' you out",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-the-energy-blues-lyrics

From U.S.A. to Japan
On the week days I be in school
Be in school learnin, the golden rule
I wake up in the morning hangin' out my bed
I don't do a thing till my grace is said
And when it's said, I wipe my ass
And think off all the fly girls in my class
Pay off the don say it can't hurt
I pull on my Lee's and my blue sweat shirt
Walk around the corner seem to catch the bus
And if the bus ain't there I don't dare fuss
Just tell mama I'm Mister bust a day
And she take me to school in a white OJ
But when I get to the school and the bell ring
I don't even worry cause it ain't no thing
Walk in the room they say you're late for class
Teacher mark me late, I'm gonna kick his ass
You know the teachers is gonna listen to me

I'm at home in my boxers watchin' Tom Warner classics

While you hear that kick, high drums and snares
Puttin you right here met ya chicken out in Brooklyn
When I hit that rare, air, you don't wanna see Black
When I get mad cause I come and Black axe, square Black maks
It's a real thing while I hold my hands on this microphone
I get it open till the breakadawn, or maybe to the sky kerr caucasian
Y'all be rockin for rhythyms I rock for blacks nations
I leave you all in a daze
I'm pickin' up these flows like pimps that brush waves
Get it for all days my broke cup pawn flows

Me and Superman we had a fight
I punched him in the face for all my might
Punched him so hard he fell to the floor
Picked him up, and ragged him some more
Turned around, and who did I see?
It was ah Lois Lane she was lookin' at me
She said: ""Yo Biz Markie you are the best
Cause you knocked the S off Superman's chest""
She took my hand and led me to the room
We smoked three joints and cracked the core of the brew
I looked her up I thought she was fine
I knew the deal; what was on her mind
We took off the clothes and clicked off the light
And we rocked the bed, till the sky was white
When it came to the break of day
She said: ""Yo Biz Markie why don't you stay?
I've cooked you some breakfast with some orange juice""
That's one thing I couldn't refuse
At around eight I kissed her goodbye
She said: ""Whoo! Biz Markie you one hell of a guy!""

Perfection direction, in any section
My style is kicking like Chinese Connection

Walk around with a name belt and a funky new rap
Shell tops new and Space Invaders cap
Old school like, bread and gravy
Me and Monty roll together like Fred and Grady
Ain't, nothin you can say to stop this mad man
Play Defender, Centipede and Ms. Pac-Man
Just like Martin Luther I had a dream
In a house with no heat, just kerosene
Call Biz Mark, so you get the better connection
The type to wear Timbs to a weddin reception
I'm so smart, I even got a GED
Plus a vide-oh-oh, BET, and MTV
I'm the best thing out now go ask your moms
Spendin money on cars just to pass the time

Four chicken wings with shrimp fried rice, that's good

Chicken chow mein with a little white rice, that's good

I need a couple of egg rolls in my neighborhood, that's good

I'm the Uptown rhymer, large like Big Momma
Keep three girls on the couch like ""Oh Drama""
End every line with period, no comma
Hidin out 'til I'm found like Osama
Walk on water, filled with pirahnas
Want the tie within coats with no liner
If I ever lose my girl, I go find her
If not, I got Shirl' and Tawanna
Right back on ya, yep the old timer
Any contract you got, I no sign-a
Don't smoke or use drugs, of no kind-a
Everything that I wear, is de-signer
Just like Dolce, hang with Gabbana
Biz Mark play his part, the show timer
Make any party hot like your sauna
Still keep the crowd controlled with no drama
 - change last line to ""I need SOME egg rolls.."" etc

It's the Mmah, Zah-aYYAH, Rrah, Zah-KaYYAH
When Guiliani leave I will be the Mayor
In the year two-thou', I'm gonna house
I'm still tryin to look up a girl's blouse
Got a Hummer for the summer, Benz for my girlfriend
When it comes to ice, I got a lot of dia-monds
I'm hangin at the Rucker, watchin skip-to-my-loo

I rock weddings from Toni Braxton, to Boyz II Men Shawn
And this is what they say, word is bond


Let me tell you how I started in ninety-two
When I was DJ'n from Jersey to Howard U
I did homecomings from U-V-A to James Madison
And did The Tunnel, Reflect, or Kordell and Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ love
From rockin from Virginia and seein the Q Club
People looked at me and said ""Why you DJ'n?""
""I loved +Oh Baby You..+ and you're a rock singer""
So the transition from rappin to DJ wasn't smooth
But I still pursued cause I had somethin to prove
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From {?} to Jones Street to Philly Greek Picnic
Florida and Bayou Classic and Atlanta Freaknik
All the girls, in G-strings and thongs
If you would, please just sing along",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-party-to-the-break-a-day-lyrics
Let Me See U Bounce,Weekend Warrior,2003,"Biz Markie and Elephant Man, we sensei
Bump fair ladies like Sean Paul, okay, c'mon!

Ladies and gentlemen, how do you do (a do)

The Diabolical came to get the job done
Cause I'm the, Woogie Boogie and the master of fun
If you're ready to rock, and ready to get down
The grand groovin here to prove a different sound
I gotta get funky for the Y2K
Each and every time I know what to say
East West Midwest and the Dirty South
Always love the way that I be rockin the house
All the ladies, in the new jeans
Like Steve Arrington, you make me weak at the knees
I'm glad to be right here with y'all
Let the players play, and ballers ball, so

Yes, I'm here to confess
That I took the S off Superman's chest
He got mad cause I felt, Lois Lane's breasts
I asked her could I touch 'em and she said yes
So I guess, that I got the most finesse
Cause I wear {?} Fila, Ecko, Akademic and Guess
When I watch cartoons I watch Johnny Qwest
I wake up in the mornin and shower with Zest
I hope you understand the rhyme I express
And that you know, poppa don't take no mess
You're rockin with the best, so forget the rest
Cause you know that the Biz always pass his tests
Like if I was in high school sittin at a desk
Starin at a teacher, lookin up her dress
You gotta admit that the rhymes are fresh
Right about now I gotta take recess
So uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh
Uhh, ahh, uhh, ahh
Make it sexy, sexy baby
Make it sexy, sexy baby
Make it sexy, sexy baby
So shake it baby just shake it baby

Throw Back,Weekend Warrior,2003,"I'd like to tell a story and it goes like this
Before I was makin money hand over fist
The mid-80's is what I'm talkin about
You will agree without a reasonable doubt
As I tell this tale, sittin on a pail
This is one you'll like when it's done
Only certain people know about Union Square
The Rooftop, Latin Quarter, cause I was there
Red Alert downtown, Brucie Bee uptown
Grandmaster Vic had a different sound
You had block parties, with free gifts
Mr. Magic and Marley gave radio a lift
You don't understand, but we do
That's why I'm tryin to explain it to you
So sit back and listen, to what I say
As I tell the story of this beautiful day

""We'll go dancing in the dark"" - HEY!
""Walking through the park, and reminiscing""
BREAK IT ON DOWN!

Before Versace and DKNY
There was a lot of clothes that was fly
Like Polo, Benetton, Coca-Cola and Osh Kosh
Guess jeans and others that's acid washed
D.C. wore K-Swiss and Sergio Tacchini
Girls wore tennis skirts, that was mini
Spot{?}, Ewings, Le Coq Sportif
New Balance, Fila, Nike and Ellesse
African clothes and medallions was worn
And when Rakim came out, knowledge was born
In the midst of it all, I almost forgot
There was a brother uptown makin his own spot
Makin Gucci, leather and suede tailor made
That had more flavor than mom's Kool-Aid
I'm gonna tell you, the name of this man
He goes by the name of the Dapper Dan


See at this time, you might think I'm strange
Cause I wore a four-finger ring, and big gold chains
Like I was Mr. T from the A-Team
It was just a sign of me makin cream
But the cars and jeeps was incred-a
Like the Audi, 280 Z's, 98's and Jettas
Cherokees, Wranglers, Suzuki Sidekicks
L.A. and West coast cars was doin tricks
Now the dances was crazy to match
Like the Pee Wee, The Wop and the Cabbage Patch
The Prep, The Snake, and ""The Biz Mark, Biz Mark""
The way the Gucci Girls gave shows a spark
Now listen, to what I got to say-ah
Reagan was Pres', and Koch was the Mayor
You can't beat that with a baseball bat
And you'd never see me without my Biz Mark hat

Turn Back the Hands of Time,Weekend Warrior,2003,"This is a story about without a doubt
When I'm done, you will all scream and shout
They always say time is on our side
If it is, why is it a rough ride?
If I could save time or return to the past
I would bring back the good times, hate to last
Like when I was the size of Jay-Z
Back when Ra was still with Eric B
Remember when friends was friends, and LL had a Benz?
And cell phones and beepers was the new trends?
When Koch was the mayor and Reagan was the Pres?
We listened to what other enemies said

I wish there was somethin made, or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time
I wish there was somethin made, or somethin designed
Where I could turn back the hands of time

I know y'all remember goin to Great Adventure
On Labor Day on the Beach in Virginia
The beginnin of the summer, at Jones Beach
When t-shirts, were ten dollars each
Didn't matter if you had a Lex, Beamer or a Benz
As long, as you had room for, all of the friends
Mr. Softee came through, or the Good Humor truck
When ice cream, was less than a buck
If it was up to me and I could turn back the clock
I'd bring Masterdon, Buffy, and Scott LaRock
So - please listen to my song and rhyme
If I can turn back the hands of time
 w/ ad libs

If I could turn time back in a rhyme
I'd bring back Bird, Magic, Jordan - in their prime
Remember the days OH, remember the days
When they had the high-top, fade craze
Want back Big Daddy Kane, Fresh Prince and Kid & Play
""Ohhh, what a beautiful day!""
When parties was parties, and clubs was clubs
You could tell the real MC's from all the scrubs
When havin your own style and originality
And your character and real personality
But I have to go, and off I sign
If I can turn back the hands of time
 - 2X w/ ad libs

I wish there was somethin made
Bring back Aaliyah! (Jam Master Jay)
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Biggie and 2Pac
I wish there was somethin made to bring back Scott LaRock
I wish somethin bad, I wish there was somethin made
To bring back, Left Eye (Barry White)
I wish there was somethin to bring back my man Dahsil Masterdon
I wish there was somethin made to bring back my man Keith Cowboy
My man B.O., my man Step from Baltimore
I wish there was somethin to bring back
All the strange people that I knew that, was a part of my life

Soon to be elected in the Hall of Fame
I rock the microphone, emceeing's my game
I flip so many styles, my name should be Flipper
On Three's Company, I wish I was Jack Tripper
Back in the days, I used to eat {?}litina{?}
Back in the days, my sister had a Thumbelina
Back in the days, I liked a girl named Angelina
Back in the days, I wanted to get in between her
My jingle bella, always Roc-A-Fella
Even my acapella will be a best seller
She couldn't believe what I had achieved
Funky like ring around the collar, doo doo on the sleeves
Enquiring minds always want to know
How did I get my ill freestyle flow?
I just tell 'em straight up without no B
Ask me no questions yo, here's my ID


I'm not Captain Kirk, or Mr. Spock
When I put the party people in a state of shock
I'm like Mark Twain, or Shakespeare
Cause when I'm on the stage, people throw they hands in the air
Wavin 'em wild, like in a frenzy
Dog in the house like I'm Spuds McKenzie
I'm just doin it, just rockin the house
Sucker MC's is spiders or mouse
Comin off the top of my head
I'm not dumb so don't be misled
When I was young, I never pissed in the bed
Always listened to what my moms and pops said
Love reggae so much, you could call me a dred
Got a big belly so you know I'm well fed
And I'm a lover-lover like my name is Ed
And I'm +2 Awesome+ like K and Teddy Ted

Never had a cameo, never had a perm
I'm not Billy Dee, or R. Kelly
Or, Markie Dee or B.I.G
I'm a, LITTLE somethin like Heavy D
Because ""girls ah girls they love me""

You that one year scream BLING rapper
Dapper than Dapper Dan, my interior's Gucci
Overdosin, call me John Belushi
Never liked Lucy and I beat Little Ricky
Made him +Cry a River+ like his name was Britney
I rock gold chains, I never wore the platinum
Unless records was jewelry and it come from rappin
(WOW!!) Like the Diabolical Biz
I'm followin his, style - how are you kids?
This here is real, Mobb Deep underground
Take me to funkytown, and drive around
I hop out the Hummer, the same color as the truck
Fake cats lookin Biz like ""Hey whassup?""
I'm a vet, and never wore a green suit
The only army is Def Squad, believe troop!


Ah let's do it, let's do it
Work your mind, put your body in-to it

I got mo' toys than Mr. Spock

Listen listen listen to the Emmezah-A
Rrazah-K, always makin your day
Without further adieux for you and yours
Luckier than a gambler throwin 3's and 4's
Just like {?} pageantry
That I could turn the party out, make the ladies scream

It's the M-zah, A-ah, R-zah, K-ah
Like the internet, I am here to stay-ah
Been a long time, I know it's been years
Oops! I did it again, like Britney Spears
Like The Matrix and Keanu Reeves
Ringed around the collar and doo doo on the sleeves
I'm explosive like dynamite
I should be on ""Entertainment Tonight""
Or ""Access Hollywood"" or ""Soul Train""
I'm so on fire, I fart propane
Don't use Rogaine, got a head full of hair
Cause the brother on the mic is so debonnaire
I'm so cool, the Fonz say ""EYY!""
Cause I'm the best MC from around my way
Never listen to what haters say
I just stay focused like Kobe in L.A


I'mma do it like I never have done it
Never got drunk and never got blunted
The Redox in my ear, they cost about a hundred
If the record's a hit, you know the Biz spun it
Super educated master rap techniquer
Ill funk freaker every day of the week-ah
Whether it's Kim, Agnes, Monique or Tamika
My unique physique make 'em all weaker and weaker
Cause I'm hung, like Mighty Joe Young
They all get sprung, from the joy that I brung
I drive a Hummer, I'm hot like Donna Summers
I'm one of the first human (rum-a-pum pummers)
No matter what they say, I always sound flyer
Than anyone you heard, or even de-sired
Yes it's me, I'm the Original B-I-Z
M-A-R-K-I with the E


The beat don't stop 'til everybody's gone
I'm old school like a bag of Bon Ton
Like the Mary Jane Girls I go ""All Night Long""
Hit you in the head like El Kabong
My style is masculine, far from feminine
I got soul like James Brown and Rakim and 'em
I don't know what you came to do
I came to rock the house for you
From sunny California to Kalamazoo!
Been rockin parties since ninety-two
I know you heard that Reality Bites
But I'm liver than the show called ""Saturday Night""
I stay on, it looks like city lights
Chicks cling on me like ballerina tights
Like Minute Mouse and Courageous Cat
You can't beat that with a baseball bat!",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-like-a-dream-lyrics
Friends,Weekend Warrior,2003,"I saw this girl from like around the way
I told her I was the B-I-Z Emezah-A
She said she know my reputation, know I got clout
And like to get to know me, without no doubt
So we started havin long telephone conversations
Tryin to feel each other out, showin a lot of patience
Was a hook-up from my man, word bond she was bad
If I met her whole family I would kiss her dad
So in my mind I was thinkin she really liked me
She got a good head on her shoulder and she's no dummy
Me and her, had compatible horoscopes
But she bugged me out so bad I was on the ropes
Now when I was with her, my shoulders shrugged
Because when I reached out for a kiss and hug
She mushed me in my face, and smiles with a grin
And said this question

Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?  We can't we be friends?
Why can't we, be, friends?  We can't we be friends?

I knew she was different, a very special gal
For the time being, hmm I shall
Respect her wishes, she wasn't a groupie
I understand, she said she just had met me
I liked her for that, a woman with morals
She called me every day, so I saw she was loyal
It bugged me out cause I don't usually wait
But on a scale of one to ten she was a twenty-eight
We was goin out on the reg', movies and dinner
Always stay at my house, way past ten o', clock
I thought she really really liked me
I did the right thing, like my name was Spike Lee
She had her own car so I walked her to the door
Like Busta Rhymes I said, ""Gimme Some More""
So I put my lips out, to get a kiss
And she said just like this


I knew somethin was wrong because my mack is correct
Talkin for six months and didn't hit it yet?
I thought I was slippin, or maybe in a slump
I felt like Eddie Murphy when he was Professor Klump
Naw it can't be, she's here every day
So I don't know why she'd wanna treat me this way
I gotta investigate like Magnum P.I
I just don't understand, why oh why
So the next time I saw her she was unhappy
She had a frown on her face and real jumpy
I said, ""Yo what's wrong?""  I was real concerned
The way she looked her life had took a real turn
She said, ""I went to court today,"" and I said, ""What?""
""If I tell you this, you're gonna go nut""
I said, ""Tell me I can take it I won't pretend""
""I gotta go to jail for life, so..""",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-friends-lyrics

Hi there good lookin, pretty sweet thang
I really want to put you under my wing
But everytime I try you give me a hard time
Like I'm a murderer, or commitin a crime
I try to do everything right for you
You're always givin me excuses, makin me blue
When I met you at Cancun, at Fiesta Americana
You lookin tasty like strawberries and banana
I asked you your name you said Lee-Lee from San Fran
She said, ""I have friends but I don't got a man""
I said, ""Really?!  As good as you look?
Lookin like somethin out a Playboy book?""
I thought I struck gold, ching ching, the jackpot
Just the thought of you it be makin me hot
When I step to you, you act funny style
You need to marinate on this for a while


Now let me tell you like this baby doll
I never guessed you would act off the wall
Give me a chance for a little romance
We can dance and dine in Jamaica or France
Somethin in the way you make me feel
I like your personality, and your sex appeal
But it's all hard, not bein witchu
You're playin hard to get like catch 22
Some people got time to play them games
But I don't, so don't call me no names
Like all I want is sex, and take you no places
And, why you always up in girls face
You know, I'm the B-I-Z, this is my job
Fans nibble on me like corn on the cob
Let me tell you somethin, my word is bond
Like ""Bonita Applebum,"" you gotta put me on


If I didn't feel you, I wouldn't send you roses
Jewelry, furs, and designer clotheses
You know you got me, that's why you do what you do
Stressin and depressin, me and my crew
You know it's got to be real like Sheralyn
Or you wouldn't be askin for an encore again
I know you like me!
So you might as well ""Do the Right Thing"" like Spike Lee
Because I love you more than human eyes can see
Cause you got what I need, ""OH BABY!""
I don't know why you give me real rough times
Cause you're the one that rings my chimes
You bring me joy like Mary J
I wanna do the same thing to you every day
So stop playin your games like Barry White
You know, you know, YOU KNOW!  AIIIGHT?

First girl, I ever had was a screamer

I was a rap king
But you know, on the tables I've been doin my thing
Like Lisa Stansfield, I've been around the world
I'm from New York, like Earl the Pearl
But since I live in Washington I'm Redskin like Levon
Hangin' at Dream and V.I.P. like a superstar
But I don't buy the bar, I buy a Red Bull
And sip and look at all the chicks that's, beautiful
Like dark-skinned, light-skinned
White, Puerto Rican, Ital-ian
I like to see them dance and drippin with sweat
Givin' them more than they were supposed to get
Winter, spring, summer or fall
Whether you're eatin' food or drinkin' alcohol
They gonna rock your body all night long
'Cause this beat, it kick your ass like King-Kong
Listen to B, I am the
Original S-K B-I-Z, RRAHHAAAAHAHHHHHHH

You can do the hokey pokey or even the wop
I don't care what you do baby, just don't stop
A zunga zeng to the break of day
Listen to the brother with the rhythm rhymes I display
Whether you from New York or L.A
You listenin' to the B-I-Z every day
I was always a class clown, never the teacher's pet
That's why right now I'ma do the alphabet
Like A-B-C-D-E-F-G
H-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p
Q-Rrrah-S, T-U-V
Ah W-X say Y and Z
That's why a lot of emcees wanna see
If I'm gonna fall off but I'm not G
I'm guaranteed to go all night with rhymes I write
I've gotten the mic guaranteed like Entertainment Tonight
So listen as I take a breather
I'm old school New Yorker like my name's Contiva{?}

Long Island, New Jersey, and I'm on the scene",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-ei-ya-lyrics

This is what I love to do
Besides it bein a hobby, this is what I love to do
I love to look for records, I love to play the records
I love to, rock the crowd when they don't expect it
Love to go to Chicago where they like house and club
Even love Jamaica where they do the rub-a-dub
I like B.More, V-A and D.C
I can break it down and so on like I'm most definitely
I can shake it in Miami, A-T-L and Carolinas
But New Orleans and Texas know my bounce is finer
St. Lou', Tennessee, Detroit, Philly to L.A
They know I par-tay to the break of day
Can't forget Boston, Connecticut and across sea

Nothing's like a nice derriere
Looks so good, it's just not fair
Now let me tell you a story about a girl named Judy
Was a 5 in the face, but had a real nice booty
It was so soft and mesmerizin
I met her in Jersey by ( ? )
Oh my goodness, I almost lost my mind
When I saw this hee-haw that was so divine
Now I would usually just kept goin
But it hypnotized me the way she was throwin
I said, ""You want a burger and fries with that shake?""
She said, ""No, I want shrimp, lobbster and a steak""
Bein Rockefeller is not my duty
The only reason I changed my mind is because..

You look good to me

Tell you what happened to me while I was mindin my biz
I came across a girl by the name of Liz
Puerto Rican or Spanish, almost went frantic
For bein a 10 she was a body mechanic
I was bee-beein on what I was seein
It's like Pocahontas jumped out the TV, an
Hourglass shape that made me go ape
Ask Lil' Mo, she was a 'superwoman' with a cape
She couldn't speak no English, I had Fat Joe with me
So he could tell me what she was sayin about me
She said, ""I like papi with big belly""
I said, ""Why'd you tell her in Spanish that I want her tele
-phone,"" now you know it's on
Like hot butter on say what, the popcorn
I had to have that cause she's a cutie
And you know the other reason why is because..

You look good to me
When I walk through the club what do I see
A real fly cutie
You look good to me
You look good to me
That ass is fat
Oh Lord, yeah
You yeah, oh, look good

Now let me tell you how I started in '92
When I was deejayin in Jersey in Howard Hughes
I did homecomings from UVa to James Madison
I did the Tunnel with Flex and caught L in Patterson
Now I graduated with DJ Love
From ( ? ) Virginia, NC and the Q Club
People looked at me and said, ""Why you deejayin?
I like Just a Friend and your rhyme-sayin""
So the transition from rapper to DJ wasn't smooth
But I still pursued cause I had somethin to prove
July 4th and Labor Day in Virginia was hot
Cause Biggie Smalls and Teddy Riley was in the spot
From the relays to all the Greek picnics
And all the football ( ? ) and Atlanta Freakniks
To all the girls in g strings and thongs
If you're with me, just sing along


I got so much on my mind like my name was Chuck D
That when it comes to deejayin I'm a Public Enemy
I rock all colors, races and ages
When the crowds see me go crazy they think I'm outrageous
I rocked Sinbad, Essence and the Grammy's
All Magic Johnson joints, even in Miami
First Fridays from Philly to the Lou
( ? ) and Alex know what I can do
Chicago with Corey, Detroit with D. Archer
New York with Gator, Lenny Smith and Lenny the Barber
I rocked all the joints for Eddie Murphy and ( ? )
Still get down and dirty in Newark, Elizabeth
Rock ( ? ) Orlando
Even go across seas to London and Tokyo
I rocked weddings from Toni Braxton to Boyz II Men's Shawn
And this is what they say on and on",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-come-party-lyrics
Bad Day,Friends EP,UnKnown,"Ah..
Man, why did it have to happen to me?
Man, what did I do to get this?
What'd I do to deserve this?
Check it out
(Verse 1: Biz Markie)
I woke up in the morning with my hand on my head
Not knowin this would be one day that I'd dread
I prayed the night before, for a let-me-live
The way this day turned out wasn't my prerogative
I went to the kitchen to get some cereal smooth as silk
But when I looked in the ice box, there wasn't no milk
Well I don't need no breakfast, I'm too fat anyway
I just grab a cup of juice and be on my way
So I got my car keys, on route to my job
I walked out, my windows broken and my car got robbed
They took my radio and my favorite cassette
What a way to start the day, aww - what's next?
I get to the office, my boss starts to scream
It was really unbelievable, like a bad dream
He kept talkin all this blahse blahse
And looked at me and said, ""What you have to say?""
(Chorus)
I'm havin a bad day
Things ain't goin my way
I'm havin a bad day
Today, today
(Verse 2: Biz Markie)
Here's somethin else that happened to me
In the middle of this day that's bein deep
To begin this era of grief and aggravation
I was parked by a meter and still got a citation
Took the ticket off my window, got in my car alright
A cop pulled behind me at a red light
""Your licence, registration and insurance card""
I was buggin out cause it was really hard
I didn't do nothin, asked, ""Why'd you pull me over?
You never saw a young man drive a Range Rover?""
He let me go and said, ""Don't do it again"" - ""Why,""
I said, ""thank you officer, you been a nice guy""
So I stopped at the store to get somethin to drink
Guess what happened to me before I could blink
They had my truck in the air, just about to be towed
For $700 in tickets I owed
(Chorus)
(Verse 3: Biz Markie)
After all that I could finally go home
And rest my feet and get on the telephone
I had a unbelievable time in the city
I shoulda be down with the ( ? ) committee
I tried to cook some dinner but it came out burnt
The fire was too hot, I just had learned
So freak it, I'll go to a restaurant
I brought a girl with me, asked, ""What do you want?""
""Shrimp and lobster, two bottles of Alizé""
I looked at her and said, ""Hey hey hey!""
She ate all the food and drank all of the liquor
I better bring her home so I can stick her
So I got her to my house as fast as I can
This is like takin candy out of a baby's hand
But when I got her to my room, without no doubt
She was so intoxicated that she passed out

Before I catch asthma or emphysema
You can catch me in a playsport or a beamer
I rip and rag, play freeze tag
But since I got older its all such a drag
But it dont matter now like purina cat chow
The first beat I did was meow meow meow meow
Dont have a son or daughter even though I oughta
Its almost ten years since I rocked at the quarters
Roof top program ? baby what a man
Now I plays the tunnel ??

Just a friend - single version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love she wanted you to wait
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got on stage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, ""Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you're hundred proof""
I asked her her name, she said, ""Blah-blah-blah""
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, ""How do you like the show?"" She said, ""I was very amused""
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, ""Do ya have a man?"" She tried to pretend
She said, ""No I don't, I only have a friend""
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I took Blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine and Jag
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named Blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', gettin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build a
Relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Every time that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up and then I called again
I said, ""Yo, who was that?"" ""Oh, he's just a friend""
Don't gimme that, don't even gimme that, just bust this
You, you got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, got what I need, but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
Yo, could you tell me where is door three?
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-just-a-friend-single-version-lyrics
Toilet Stool Rap,UnKnown,UnKnown,"G-goobely-goo
Ah-h-h-hm
Ah yeah
Now check it out
I would walk into the bathroom to take a crap
I sit down, and then I write me a toilet stool rap
Whether I'm constipated or have diarrhea
I always come out with a funky fresh idea
Even if you don't think it's funky fresh, and
To all the little kids I'm makin a good impression
Cause a lot of my hits are written on the john
I hope my legendary style of rap lives on
This's a hidden secret where classics come from
Everybody has done it, even my man Run
Only in there I am the king of the throne
Hey, hey, you know I can't be alone
No girls, no guys, no dogs, no cats
No parents, no nieces, no nephews, no brats
That's the only way that I can get privacy
And you know where I write my funky fresh rhymes live, you see...
Me sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo...
Yo, bust it
Let me tell you a little something bout this episode
It was four in the morning, chillin on my commode
It was me, my pad, and pen, and my bad breath
All of a sudden I came up with somethin that was real def
I was thinkin, what a real beatbox could do
What if I put a hype beat with the ""p-pf 1-2""?
Then I write some words, so I really can use it
I think I would name this one Make The Music
Like if I was the man that they call Clark Kent
Cause I go into the bathroom for rhymes I invent
Then I come out on stage like Superman
But never show the people my masterplan
Instead of movin towels, or movin vowels
Only think I'm doin, is movin bowels
A tv in the bathroom just might spoil it
Only thing I can say is...
I'm sittin on a toilet
Waitin for my bowels to move
I got a doodoo rap
I got a doodoo

 And I'm the P. Diddy
 So you know what time it is
 A-come on
 If you
 If you
 Wanna know
 Wanna know
 The real deal, about the Biz
 A-say what?
 And that's comin from me, the P. Diddy
 And you know what time it is, RIGHHHT

So come on Diabolical
Don't stop and don't you dare quit
Just get on the mic, sit on the mic
Spit on the mic and don't you dare quit!

When I get on the mic, I guarantee
There's no better MC than Biz Markie
Everything I say, or anything I do
Will move yo' posse or your crew
When you me hear me say, and what I play
Affects a lot of people in the strangest way
Well I'm too cold to freeze, too hot to burn
And I never miss a tag when it's my turn
Cause I can, rock the mic if you give me a chance
Cool V'll cut the record, make you do the 'Biz Dance'
I can - flip the crowd with a wave of my hand
I'm the Diabolical, ""And you know this MAAAAAAN!""

You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone
You can do your thang, and any-thang you choose
But please, please, leave my thang alone

I'm the court jester, the manifester
I used to buy my clothes at A.J. Lester's
The rhymerator, the beat creator
Whack rappers get dropped like a hot potato
The dime repeater, the MC greeter
Knuckle bleeder, no need for a heater
The only MC in history
Who didn't even have to R-A-P
The bum destroyer, I'm comin for ya
Got took to court and didn't need a lawyer
Make James Brown get down (yeah yeah)
Made Beretta go get her (yeah yeah)
Made Laverne and Bill Cosby (yeah yeah)
Go change they sweaters (yeah yeah)
I fought Mike Tyson, dropped him in 4
Went to Fort Knox and kicked down the door
Rocked seven continents with all this flow
""And this is somethin for the radi-ohhhh""


Got ladies screamin STRANJE STRANJE
With the rhythm and rhymes and style that I display
If rap was sex, I'd be a porno star
With Sade, and Janet, in a menage-a-trois
Merrily merrily, life is just a dream-ah
First car, I ever had was a Beamer
First girl, I ever had was a screamer
I got out of breath and almost caught emphysema
Put the party people in a state of shock
While Biz compose songs like Sebastian Bach
This is the end of this scenario
Like Robin Harris, ""I gotta go - gotta go!""

Just a Friend (Re-Recorded),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Have you ever met a girl that you tried to date
But a year to make love, she wanted you to wait?
Let me tell ya a story of my situation
I was talkin' to this girl from the U.S. nation
The way that I met her was on tour at a concert
She had long hair and a short miniskirt
I just got onstage drippin', pourin' with sweat
I was walkin' through the crowd and guess who I met
I whispered in her ear, 'Come to the picture booth
So I can ask you some questions to see if you are a hundred proof'
I asked her her name, she said 'blah-blah-blah'
She had 9/10 pants and a very big bra
I took a couple of flicks and she was enthused
I said, 'How do you like the show?'
She said, 'I was very amused'
I started throwin' bass, she started throwin' back mid-range
But when I sprung the question, she acted kind of strange
Then when I asked, 'Do ya have a man?' she tried to pretend
She said, 'No I don't, I only have a friend'
Come on, I'm not even goin' for it
This is what I'm goin' sing
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I took blah-blah's word for it at this time
I thought just havin' a friend couldn't be no crime
'Cause I have friends and that's a fact
Like Agnes, Agatha, Germaine, and Jacq
Forget about that, let's go into the story
About a girl named blah-blah-blah that adored me
So we started talkin', getttin' familiar
Spendin' a lot of time so we can build up
A relationship or some understanding
How it's gonna be in the future we was plannin'
Everything sounded so dandy and sweet
I had no idea I was in for a treat
After this was established, everything was cool
The tour was over and she went back to school
I called every day to see how she was doin'
Everytime that I called her it seemed somethin' was brewin'
I called her room, a guy picked up, and then I called again
I said, 'Yo, who was that?' 'Oh, he's just a friend'
Don't gimme that, don't ever gimme that
Jus' bust this
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
And you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend, oh baby
You, you got what I need but you say he's just a friend
But you say he's just a friend
So I came to her college on a surprise visit
To see my girl that was so exquisite
It was a school day, I knew she was there
The first semester of the school year
I went to a gate to ask where was her dorm
This guy made me fill out a visitor's form
He told me where it was and I was on my way
To see my baby doll, I was happy to say
I arrived in front of the dormitory
'Yo, could you tell me where is door three?'
They showed me where it was for the moment
I didn't know I was in for such an event
So I came to her room and opened the door
Oh, snap! Guess what I saw?
A fella tongue-kissin' my girl in the mouth
I was so in shock my heart went down south
So please listen to the message that I send
Don't ever talk to a girl who says she just has a friend
Ayyy boi",https://genius.com/Biz-markie-just-a-friend-re-recorded-lyrics
