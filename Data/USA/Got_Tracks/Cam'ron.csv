Takeover Freestyle, Diplomats Volume 1,UnKnown,"When it comes to these guns my men'll clap this
Bullets I will send you access
I'm about to Reynolds Wrap this
School all the haters, blue is the gators
Do me a favor dawg don't do me no favors
I've put undercovers, under covers
Not only that I put guns to mothers
Sons and brothers, aunts, nieces, nephews
Cousins to in-laws, no one's above us
Guns in Ruckers (Ruckers) now no one can duck us
Your parents ain't shit, y'all the sons of suckers
Son of a bitch, I sell the slugs
Keep a shotgun like Elmer Fudd
You could tell the judge dawg
I sat in the cell with thugs
One year and eight months still felt the love (no homo, all good)
Act drastic killa, pack plastic
You rap black bastard get your cap clapped backwards
Round ice, I'm as nice as Gretzky
Dug Lewinsky NC like Mike Krzyzewski
Bomb missions, Saddam vision
But I send you a tape of your sister and your mom kissin'
My dick that is, see how I foul them bitches is
Four minutes they gon' lick my kids
But no presents, keep your Rolies
I don't want you to teach me or mold me
I don’t need you to hold me, lease me or loan me
Ma I ain’t gonna feed you a phony
Keep it as homies or leave me alone B
Apologize?, I’m not sorry
I done came through got my jollies, undercovers say not the Ferrari
Yes he did do a part in dolly
What color he get? hot tamale
Who in the car with him, Oh my god its Hollys
Robinson and Berry, Fuck Eric Benet
Send slugs wherever you stay
Matter fact have her back, she was just used
She get married every two years the bitch is confused
Come to ice, I get it in cubes
Tried to get another bracelet, my wrist just refused
Bout time that I get at you dudes
If you wore size 30 couldn’t fit in these shoes
That cokey though, it fit in these shoes
Fuck the okie doke, opinion and views
Why you runnin, I’m gunnin, your linen is through
Bust you onion, a bunyon, any limb you can lose
I spit rounds, to cut kids down
And I sign to the Roc man don’t suck dick now
Dame looked out signed a gem
It’s all creme de la creme, now run tell a friend
Cats say how I get out my deal?
Dawg I pulled out my steal, I’m bout it for real
I ran in the Sony buildings
Smack grown folks around like they were only children
No one outta line, cause they spotted nines
I want out an y'all sign on the dotted line
Word homie I ain't kidding you hops
Only one to leave Sony without getting dropped
I’m about getting Glocks, I’m about hittin blocks
I’m about findin bitches that’s about lickin cock
Niggas ballin but they hoop game is sloppy
Dudes ill knock me, coupes ill drop me
Ask Luca Brasi
Before I come the mood be groggy
I hit four five, Hallelujah Papi
Yo I’m tryin to get through to Papi
I’m paying thirty-four and I want two from Papi
So you think you loc, we locer
You got that diplomat tattoo
We like coastra nostra
It’s perpetual, sit up in correctional
Come through shoot up a precinct like The Professional
Jim Jones get indicted just let me know
Put up the house buy the perico
We movin down to Mexico
Yeah there they won’t mention me
Call Tavisia we need new identities
You want Santiago
I’m Jose Perez, down there they don’t know them heads, shit
Who don’t think I’m the Don of Dons then bet me
Shit the way I bomb Saddam respects me
R-O-C, runnin that rap shit
Cam’ron, runnin that crack shit
Santana, runnin that gat shit
Beef nigga? that’s it, we come through and clap quick
Jimmy Jones, believe me that’s it
Fuck with Zeke you know you get slapped, bitch
I’m downtown, Gucci or Sack Fifth
Tripped on and licked on and yes by a bad bitch",https://genius.com/Camron-takeover-freestyle-lyrics

Other Side,1st of the Month Volume 1,2014,"I can show these hoes the other side
Where these niggas spend they rent
Give these bitches them hood dreams
New Coupe so I show the lean
I can teach you bout the other side
When they shake it we blow it
Grab those clips up and load em'
Can't find your bitch we the ones they going to

I grew up around the animals
The cannibals and hannibals
So if I act up understand its understandable
My father died from AIDS
And nowhere was his health
I don't care fuck him he left me to fend for myself
He smoked angel dust
And my kitchen was funky
Tried to tell me what to do
I don't listen to junkies
Two pieced him at Nana crib his tooth was broke
Then  start selling the shit my momma used to smoke
It ain't easy here
Trust me it get greasy here
Grizzly
And I ain't got no grease for my peezy hair
My uncle Bill the Thrill
Tried to get me to box
But my uncle called
He would get me them Glocks
My uncle Ted though
He would get it in flocks
My uncle Steve robbed banks and he shot at the cops
Caught the murder charges
Attempts too
This is what I can do


Ain't nobody pulling no book out
Before we book we book out
My niggas shoot up don't cook out
This barber steal my look now
is still my partner
Sug is still my stickman
Bret is still my barber
In other words my hitman
He'll clip a nigga
You know click the trigger
It gets no bigger
You beg to differ
I'll rip a nigga
Flip a nigga
Let the coroner
Zip the zipper
We don't murder cats
44 long, ever heard of that?
I'm swerving back to MIA
I need some of that Turbo Tax
Sak pase!
My Haitians let me eat
That home invasion shit
Don't ever go to sleep
In my pocket though
44k
Fuck the hired, I'll take shorty for that short stay
She ain't beef
She ain't never mad
That's the best three hours that she ever had
Murder charges
Attempts too
This is what I can do",https://genius.com/Camron-other-side-lyrics
Put It In The Sky,1st of the Month Volume 1,2014,"Kill em's good, nigga
Time is now, man
Was real good, nigga
It's been a while


Ride around, trunk full that funk, call it that parliament
Shit go for 60 a brick, I got a lot of it
Glock 9, thirty shot clip still filled with hollow tips
Get up in the booth, put the beat on and knock the molly shit
Dope came straight out the jula, like polishin'
Watch them niggas that's close, know who you ridin' with
Never get caught in between, know who you sidin' with
Watch all the bitches you fuckin', know who you slidin' with
Pussy all slippery, wrist all glittery
One five one is the mob where my niggas be
Rest in peace, Train, we gon' ball in yo memory
Fifty blunts o' sour, a gallon of the Hennessy
Slow medicine, like I got the remedy
Niggas find link, they pay the penity
Niggas get hit with the gun that killed Kennedy
New rafe and side color, cinamon grint - cuss

This shit is tough, mane
This shit it tough, mane
This shit it tough, mane

I put it in the sky (that money)
I put it in the sky (the weed)
I put it in the sky (that money)
I put it in the sky (the skunk)

Shit, if ya down, let's get it, I ride around wid it
No quarters or halfs, I'm moving by the pound wid it
Then I sit at home, gettin' dome
Bird chirpin' on the dick, that's a chicken bone
Started touching shiz-shit, I sell this shit alone
Took her from first to third base, so I sent her home
You be happy to be me, much as sassy as Ree-Ree
But every mornin', man, , you happy to see me
I deserve this life, I come from hot things to murder knife
Shoot-out, knife fights, you heard it right
From a hell tale to gosh children, I'm hellbound
ATF, CIA, FBI, DOH, what the hell now?
DT's, DA, DEA, feel like hell solo, spellbound!
It's the circus stuff, so I deserve the clown
But I'm a show closer, hell, I'll blow ya curtains down

Talk About It,1st of the Month Volume 1,2014,"Call the doctor up, the jewels sick
Front get confronted, the tools grip
My gun stay long like a pool stick
I don't need it, I could kill em with a toothpick
Like a bad hand, no prob. folding em
Make em a golf course, 18 holes in em
Like a Jamaican shirt, 28 grams I could make it work
Straight to work, like amber stay alert
'Fore I creep up behind you
Won't see me coming like the swine flu, huh... times two
Remind you I'm way way worse
Like the FK, AK, trey 8 first
I tell mami ""ohh display your purse""
Treat my dick like a sprite obey your thirst
Walk in the weed spot, Louie shirt, g-shock
Lennox Ave to d-block, we hot... oowww

My mom had 3 strokes, fell hard
No sympathys, flowers, get well cards
All swell god, no lost love Ak
She driving again, put her in soft spot
Gotta thank Tito Poppin, off top
Got her medicine, vicodins, cough drop
Now I'm back out, niggas jaw drop
Girls dras drop, glass say fuck em all ock
Hit em hard rocks, right in they soft spot
January 2nd until the ball drop
I don't lobby for more props, I'm something that ya'll not
Porsche hot, out in the ball park
The faucet leaking, I don't play with leaks
Song get played early, break his teeth
I'm a fuck the nigga up that made this beat
Two piece, dope fiend, straight to sleep

I'm a keep it a hundred, these niggas don't want it
Either a head shot or a bullet to the stomach
If you live, you'll never fully recover from it
If you die, we gon pop bottles 'til we vomit
And nah, we don't wear diamonds, we roc comets
My money came illegally, fuck it at least I'm honest
Finally bout to leave all the bullshit behind u
So right now death is the only thing I can promise
40's and the lamas, we hitting everything except the shorties in pajamas
Shooting in the Miami heat, like Chalmers
Slugs make you feel like you rocking leather bombers
Somebody call the coroners, I'm a hustler did numbers in the drought
You at your moms crib for the summer on the couch
A lot of niggas suck, nothing to figure out
They put themselves in the hole, want you to dig em out",https://genius.com/Camron-talk-about-it-lyrics
So Bad,1st of the Month Volume 2,2014,"I really thought we could've worked it out
Even gave us the benefit of doubt
But we couldn't stop playing around
Didn't understand, but I do now
Sometimes I wish that we could get it back
Because everyone deserves a second chance
But we can never go back like that
It's a shame how our good thing turned so bad
Too bad, baby
So sad
Look at all that we could've had
Just too bad

Yo, baby
Let me rescue you from the residue
I don't know what the rest'll do
But this is what the best'll do
Take you to a better view
Do things we never do
Pleasure you, treasure you
Don't skimp and measure you, girl
And they scrutinize cause you get the coupe to drive
But you caught me cheating and in stupid lies
Yeah we argued a little -- no need to pout, mama
I changed, I ain't about drama -- Scout's honor!
And you forgave me; that's why I behaved, b
You don't have to bathe me to love that you gave me, it's gravy
Grade me -- would I get a A, B?
Maybe you my lady, but you my baby


Yeah we made love; man, I wish I ain't acknowledge ya
(Wish you ain't acknowledge me?) Wish I ain't acknowledge ya
Acting like drugs -- if I do, I would have bottled ya
Bitter on Twitter, following my followers
And I don't like a follower, uh
I heard enough complaining
You getting chilly, I'mma let it burn, Usher Raymond
That's where game was served
, 
let me explain my words
You like a app in my iPhone, a angry bird
Screaming Cam name cause I do the damn thing
Forget a low down dirty, it's a damn shame
Cause you a thug cutie, Louis, snug booty
Ooh-wee, but the attitude on Judge Judy",https://genius.com/Camron-so-bad-lyrics
Soul Plane,1st of the Month Volume 2,2014,"....I could tell you how a female fake a nut for a relationship
Or how a nigga fake a relationship for a nut
How a smart nigga can play stupid but a stupid nigga can't play smart
But I'd rather just tell you about me and the things I do...You ready baby?

Got the fiends dancin, like Soul Train
Stamp on the dope, Soul Plane
They losin hair, get em Rogaine
Sell Kung-Fu, nothin like Coltrane
To keep you informed, won't catch em in a uniform
Before that, you'll see a unicorn
I blew the horn
Two girls hopped in
Oh-ten nine-eleven, homie I'm boxed in
Don't start a mess, Ima architect
Ya bum ass shirt stink, it need Carpet Fresh
White tee, Louis jeans, my Audemar the best
Two chains, hat, please don't disregard the specs
They from Switzerland, boy-boy I gits it in
Money all around the world where you niggas friends?
Actually, factually, a car you livin in
I'm three times coke baby, I need the dividends


As I'm sittin on this mailbox
Waitin for my bitch to leave the nail shop
Auntie lookin at me like I sell rock
Point-blank range, call it shell-shock
I, started off makin ounce moves
Was invited to a dinner with The Council
Two-piece, black rose on my brown suit
In two weeks, I was eatin with my mouth full
In the streets like the seventies
Long Cadillacs, bumpin Frankie Beverly
Mama known to work and go to church faithfully
I ain't gotta ask, every day she pray for me
She knew soon I'd be seven up
By the window like X with my weapon up
Fuck ya intro I'm the next best gunner up
Stand in first place with my medal yous a runner-up


Niggas runnin around, wit street dreams
Til I put em to sleep - Sweet dreams!
I played dirty, so I keep clean
The back of Deleanor is where I meet fiends
Got the whole plate, you don't have three beans
Did Eighth with a eighth in Lee jeans
Tonight, got the chauffeur
Showin off the loafers
You cowards: turkeys, the bullets: Stouffer's

Dom P, Cliq, and Rose
Fruit bowls, few hoes, on the Dolce
OG's round the table but I won't say
Let's make a toast to everyone on the coke chase
Coupe rose, two-tone, parked with no plates
You too close, you gotta ask, can you approach me?
I told em sports wasn't my forte
How can I be like you, and get all this dope cake?

Let me know, you feel me right?
Live niggas know the game its sad but they ain't got the change to play it
You talk a good one, but are you good son?
Keep it real wit ya self
Before you end up dealin wit ya health, man
You know me, Vado!",https://genius.com/Camron-soul-plane-lyrics
C.F.W.U.,1st of the Month Volume 2,2014,"Yo, I had a dream Hud 6
Said 'Killa Yo, killa, you put the real in rap'
And your style, man your style, he be stealin’ that'
And those niggas uptown, we gon’ be feelin’ that
But with that deep shit
You gon’ be feelin’ that Fuck the schools
Jumped in and pushed the ceiling back
And if it tires like the orange
I was peelin’ that
Pardon my absence
I was spendin’ too much time
In the Aspens, killin’ ‘em off with asprin
I ain’t talkin’ slopes
When I say skeet up
And this movie money got me with my feet up
Percentage do come in
I should name it the re-up
We up, TBE, no-one can defeat me Shawn
That nigga money made
The weather don’t matter, I fly to a sunny day
I backed out fact, man
Who wanna come and play?
You ain’t got to run away, british
Go put the gun away
I’m gone
I smoke spliffs
On my lawn
I'm slicker than the Fonz
With more kicks than Solange
Cool shit, waistline
Full clip them off Finish with the judges
With tha’ bullshit they on
We started gifts with a train
Dealt with part of the team

In 98? killa went platinum
Then broke jaws for the team
Them big stupid old mansions
Ain’t nuttin’ change but the mansions
I’m still in the cut with a bad bitch
Lettin’ that champagne spill while
I’m dancing The all by just text me
Said the Lord’s always gon’ bless me
I pray you, I got the gun on me
If a nigga eva try to scratch me
I still kill for killas, make one call for my dealer
In a hall of war, in the summertime we still do
Four wheelers Rich Porter
Brick orders one nigga won six quarters
Still fuck on that white girl
But I’m gettin’ money with that bitch daughter
(Hey, molly)
Brenda had a baby
When I had Mercedes I’m a serial killa
Just might stab yo lady

Cam certified me on day one
I shot a nigga on day two
Bought a Benz on day three
See why these niggas hatin’ me?
I’m Mr. Ruga
I’m still as the shooter
Baby We both got a Mac, but his a computer
Got yo shit in the stupor
Put yo bitch in Aruba
She came back with a tan
I sent her back to her man
He lookin’ for me in the club
I’m in the back bustin’ champ’ 30 racks in my hand
Clap you and yo man Bitch
Spread the word, go tell ‘em we dippin’
Again Shout out to Plugs
No name, but he settlin’ in Ride around
Drop Rari, colors Cinnamon
Temps Shootah got Glock
Nigga sneeze and the nigga abyss
Every time I pull up I look like a brick-a cooker

Said, ""Cam'ron, you bitch made!""

Tam' called Tiffany, Tiff can't stand the sweat
Tiff called Erica, Tanya and Janice up
Janice called Nika, even Havana up
They came twelve deep, three cars, bandana'd up

Standin' there lookin' like ""Damn, I embarrassed ya!""
Blood in her mascara, now it's a massacre

Father or ya uncle or ya cousin we can knuckle up
Seatbelt? No, but believe I'm buckled up
You will get muzzled up, for a couple bucks
Had to let her know my shit was unsinkable
Character who you are, reputation what they think of you
Everybody like, ""Yo, Cam, let me drink with you!""
""Link with you!"" ""Um, stink to you cuz I ain't do the clink with you!""

Criminal, general, taking vitamins, minerals
All identical, we'll lean you like benadryll

Went at d ones in d strip club, threw ma watch at her

Had dat bitch suckin dick when Cam drops suck it or not

Diamonds come from Africa, where Nelson Mandela from
We’re rouga, Ferragamo store, going hella dumb
Stomp dis lil nigga out until d paramedics come
Oh yea, you got a gun wid a body on it?

Had a ass on two knees for a bag wit 2 C’s

You won't see nobody cryin

Make sure you get yours
Lemme run it down, tho

See your boy is tough, they applauding us
If I leave, don't be sad, I been on tour wit Puff
Rapped with Ma$e, Busta, Prodigy, and ODB
Lil Wayne, Baby, Juve, Biggie Smalls smoked with me
Threw a rope to me, Ohio got smoke for me
Maryland? Dope for me! Cubans sent coke to me
Slept in Mariah house, Four Seasons Vivica
Rikers Isle, sixth building for me - prisoner
Rode jets with Kevin Lyles
(Got call from Kevin Childs)
Forever style, did Detroit, '98, 7 mile
I was livin' negative way before the record biz
But check the credits, 20 albums, I produced, executive
Consecutive! Did songs with T.I. and his brother Dro
Club promoter? Yep, for Kanye, I booked a couple shows
And that ain't 5% of my resume
That was only what I thought about yesterday

If I were to go away would you be good everyday?
Or would you be strugglin'? Boy, you gotta know
What I do is one thing, but you gon' do your thing
Just keep up the hustlin', I know you can hold it
Down down down down down down
You can hold it down down down down down

See, I have my own liquor, homie Sizzurp by the case load
Cologne in Macy’s baby, way before J-Lo
Paid In Full co-star, thought I made my own point

Got the cream, did a magazine which we own
Chill with Bun B, Pimp C., Sweet Jones
House in West Palm, my address, Bel Air (Fresh Prince)
Hell yeah! Niggas talk and talk, who the hell cares?
Hell no! I done been a way long from welfare
Selling dimes, chasin' fiends, now I got a healthcare
Understand it love fly high, kiwin dove
For my niggas hands and hugs, wanna thank the man above


I done been round and round, housing down in every town
Drivin round, when it come to weed, I sold five thousand pounds
Ten thousand pills, fifty people up in a large line
Couple hundred keys and please, that was part-time (one week)
Been through some hard times, hard grind
Right on the block ahk, sellin' hard dimes
Roll down my when it come to our hard shine
You'll have a hard time
Did Italy, The Kentucky Derby
Cursed out Bill O'Reilly, did 60 Minutes dirty
Share VIP with Michael Jordan
Mayweather-Pacquiao fights, damn, your life is boring

When Big L put me on his album I was fourteen
Mase got the deal sold three million out the 
What we been waiting for moved around state-to-state
Held'em down it was so so fresh
But he ain't put me in that deal he got with ""So So Def""
And I won't pressure you for you Little Kim and Little Cease
Got treated like a mouse a little cheese
But he told Biggie Biggie told Un (Lance Rivera)
And Un had to feel son two weeks deal (""Untertainment"") done
First album gold second one went eventually
That was cool but you taught Harlem they would mention me
Still hustle though niggas couldn't find me
I was selling rocks baby when the Roc (""RocAFella"") signed me
Took my advance went and 
Got the (Dip)Set ready we finally got our chance
Juelz (Santana) was at Syracuse Jim (Jones) state New York 
Me and Zeek (Freekey Zeekey) midwest out there and 
Oh Oh ""Oh Boy"", ""Hey Ma"" here we go
Hype Williams no I told Jim (Jones) to shoot the videos
My connect said you getting too famous
Radio and TV he don't speak the language
And we had a run longer than a marathon
To a couple of my niggas I had to pass it on
Say no more cause I tell the rest later
 gators I would impress haters
Never I said I never try to be on best behavior
The Bank' Coupe left for me an impression on my neighbours
But Lior (Cohen) popped off Kevin Liles 
Blue Lamborghini  Michael Koch  shotgun
Tim Duncan you can catch me on the block son
With a fiend in the post pass the rock got one

Weed in the air, 2 pits in the yard
Handlin' biz, cameras all over the crib

To count this much money you need enough stamina
Some went to Stanford, I grew up on Cam and them
Makin' this money and makin' it fast
Rollin' a joint and I'm makin' it last
Reppin' my Gang, ain't no fakin' it
Drivin' my car like it ain't got no brakes in it
Now both my cribs got a safe in it
Had my own swag, you start takin' it
Rollin' one up and I'm facin' it
Got so much juice you could taste the shit
Shout out to Juicy J
He rock them Louis shades

Got one, need two of them rings

Coped another Rollie, I was pressed for time
TNT pullin' up, but we don't talk to swine
Send the corner pies, hustler since 
Breakin' nights, blowin' blunts on Morningside
While you was in the nosebleeds at the Drake & Wayne tour
I was Hitler with the pounds, got like 8 off
Eatin', clean the plate off, cause they lost
First class nigga, make a flight before the takeoff

Where the hero? But this hero, play the villain

Landscape, and I swear
Got my neighbors grilling
So I cop some acres, God, to the top you take us
He know we not some fakers
Every day the cops come chase us
Not what they make us, we the minority
Wanna be the majority, skybox, watch the Lakers
So I could ball like Lucille
In the mall, I'm too real (he is real)

Them backstabbers that'll trash rappers on wack beats

Come over let's swallow and sip.""
I'm like: ""momma is sick

They all say I'm rotten and rich""
But not her, boobies' real, high heel doobie feel

And this my down girl too - ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the Jacuzzi, I tell you, my boo be's real
I mean she do be winning, Louie spinning
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen
I see boo be grinning
She looked and said: ""Cam, I know that you be sinning""
""Naw! I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
(Look) I got a whole new game plan""
Looked and said: ""That's nothing but game, Cam""
She was right, she was up in the Range, man (she know me)
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flipping the cell
That's right, I had to call up L
Yo L, what up? I hit, what else?
Plus dome, say word, and we got it on tonight

Hey ma (wassup)

All right - and we gon get it on tonight

Ladies and gentlemen

Stand the fuck up!

I'm a BK brawler
Marcy projects hallway loiterer
Pure coke copper, get your order up
I bring 'em to Baltimore in the Ford Explorer
But it's gonna cost you more if I gotta get 'em to Florida
Rucker game attender; with the Bent parked
On the sidewalk with the temp plates on the fender
I ain't hard to find you catch me front and center
At the Knick game, big chain in all my splendor
Next to Spike if you pan left to right
I own Madison Square, catch me at the fight
With Cam, once again if you pan left of his ice
It be the man that write checks with the hand that don't write
I go, off the head when I'm rambling on the mic
And I throw, off the Feds when I'm scrambling at night
And it was often said I brought hammers to the fight
But we from New York City, right Cam? (Ya damn right)

It's the home of 9/11, the place of the lost Towers

You'll get eight from the nine and straight blown
Wig split, melon cracked, all that on day one
Carry eight guns, two in the trunk
Two on the waist, two on the ankle, two to just spank you (faggot)
You get jammed with them jammers
Blammed with them blammers
Hot here, ask Mase he ran to Atlanta
You think you know what life do, mink on the motor-cycle
Trinkets they so delightful, blinging in so much ice fool (bling!)
In front of Sparks body Castellano
Block away watch by Gotti and Gravano
It's la costra nostra, someone close approach ya
They'll toast ya: gopher, bread loafer your chauffeur (over)
Coke they raise up and snort, blaze up ya fort

Midnight pitch fights, another victim

Coverage at Centre Street, got Brafman defending me
'Cause New York'll miss me if I'm locked in the penitentiary
The judge said, ""Is this that thug, from the Kit-Kat club?""
But I got enough chips stacked up to make the bitch back up
Killa, I pinch that button, I grip that snub to hit that thug
Lay up in a pitch black tub
You looking at rich black thugs that get that love
And we won't stop til I get back Blood, holla at 'em Hov'

"Losing Weight, Pt. 2",Come Home with Me,2002,"Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a car, new estate
Nah, fuck it get the beef and brocs: blue and gray
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Killa never let the drama slide
Y'all gon' hear a nigga momma die
Yell out ""homicide""

Yo, 18 months? Please, that ain't facing time
I'm stressed anyway, need it for vacation time
I'ma do the right thing though, take shock anyway
6 months, right back on the damn block anyway
But look, money from across the street
Think it's sweet, think he get money across the street
Me and my peeps often meet
And 5-0 they work for us, walk the beat
Walk with heat 'cause talk is cheap
So dun stay silent
Revolvers, automatics, guns stay silent
When it comes to beef it becomes a talent
Remember me, ODB, I'm the one from Violence, Killa
Digital ten, shit get critical friend
I got 800 invisible men
That mean it could be the bank-man
Person at the gas station filling up your tank, fam
Lady at the frank stand'll
Rat poison your relish right in the center, babe
Bitch is a renegade, she'll piss in your lemonade!
And y'all dead now
That you can bet now
Do like a toaster put your bread down
Upset now, hate when I gotta rep, clowns, blow TEC rounds
In a collision, I see their ambition
But they don't know them days I was stooped up and pitching
Or all them hot summers I was cooped up in the kitchen
When it came to grams it was 90 I fried
350 on the stove and it's 90 outside
I'ma get this girl that be stuffing my bricks
Felt life cheated her, she be cutting her wrists
Her mom died, her-on overdose stuffed in her wrist
Father fucking her, older man fucking her sis
But love my music, say I do nothing but hits
She'll do anything for me, nothing but hits
'Cause when she needed help I got her nothing but fixed
Needed coke, needed dope, yeah, I gave her a fix
So she went across the street, gave him a kiss
Stuck her tongue out, flirted, played with his dick
""You know Cam?"" He said, ""yeah"", ""Don't play with his chips""
Stood back, blazed him with 6, amazing and shit
Huh, Killa, Killa, Dipset nigga

Yo, fuck losing weight
We back on these highways moving cakes
Life's based upon what I'ma do today
Take my moms, move away
Yeah, I think I'ma cop me that new estate
Baby due today
I got to move an eighth
Fuck the scrutiny
Y'all niggas screwing me
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me
Until the shots get me

Niggas wanna know why I'm so nice
When it comes to spitting that fire, it's real dog, I live in the fire
Used to being in the streets homie, in the midst of the fire
Break work, put it in pots, sit it in fire
Quick to grab the fifth and just fire
Try to peel off, I'm hitting your tires
Hittin' your door while your car's spinning, hitting the wall
That's just the beginning of war
I let you know you dealing with dogs
My villains'll finish you off
Head in your chest, brain-
Dead on the Van Wyck expressway
While I got my hand in the TEC, wave
Niggas like ""fuck, is he stupid?"" (Yes I am)
Cops wanna cuff me, do it
You wanna be a hero, snuff me, do it, rush me, do it
Shit, like I ain't been through the scars and bruises
Like I ain't been through the bars, seen the sergeant troopers
Look at my body, I lost so much weight
Cops raiding my spot, I done lost so much weight
I'm telling Papi ""front me a brick, let me owe that cake""
He telling me he ain't got but so much weight
He been waiting for his connection to come
I'm like ""at least give me a half, I'll compress it and stretch it to one""
I'm on the block as usual
With that block that you chop and the rocks as usual
Watching for the cops that's moving through
Me and my soldiers know the rules to use ‘case we get bopped by the dudes in blue
We use cakes to get by, by the dudes in blue
Keep your mouth locked, screwed and glued
Or shots from the Ruger duke'll circle round your body like hula-hoops (woo!)
Mami told me son, hold your own
And one day you gon' grow to be a rolling stone
I believed her...
Juelz never let the cops get me
On the block 'til the shots hit me...

Ayo, fuck losing weight
I'm back on these highways moving cakes

Plus, they know what a clip get down like
Turn bags from bladders, legs to wheels, pain and pills
'Cause you fucking with a nigga that'll jump out, wave the steel

Blow smoke in your bitch face, piss on your wheels
Slap ya custies, clap ya worker, dead the strip
Stick your connect, yap your bitch
So let it be known, I'm back on my grizzly
The Sergeant, the Cap, the MAC holds 60
For rookies and vets, I'll bang 'til it click (Click)
So run and tell ya dude the Ruger come with two clips, dog
M-Easy, won't leave, my hood need me
Pop, fa-sheezy, who, don't believe me?

We get low, when the dough low, get it back

Here is somethin' you can't understaaaaaaaaand
How I could just kill a man for Killa Cam
Me and my Roc killer fam, top billers, man (Man)
We run the spots, drop ceilings fam (Fam)
Hit the wall drop ceiling fans (Ugh)
Listen boy, man I show you how to fill a van, up with killers man
And line the trunk, keep a stash box for the nine and the pump
The coach walk you through and he grind you up
What-chu want the dope or the weed?
How you want package it? In the cap or the bag?
How you want me packing? With the MAC or the Mag?
Yeah that Bent get back, but listen, scrap, act real fast
And keep a wack that'll gag your back
Block style from your swagger, your swacks
It's the Broad Street Bully, bitch
Bully niggas on the broadest streets
I house niggas on the narrowest block!
Know my rules when the barrel get hot, when the gun blows
And the shots fall, and the smoke clear
Man I be hearin' you were murdered (You ain't here!)
Nobody hit up in the cross 'cause I'm observin' (You ain't here!)
Nobody be missin' your loss 'cause you deserved it
South Philly niggas kill at will
I keep my MAC-milli CHILLY CHILL (Ugh)
On the really-real, 'fore I make you niggas feel this steel...

(Killa, Killa!)
Go 'head stupid niggas go fuck with them chicks
I'm the third little piggy, I'ma fuck with them bricks
Better yet the bakery I got pies and cakes
Nigga think doublin' is turnin' 5 to 8
I turn 8 to 20, 20 to 100, 100 to 1000
That to 100,000, in front-a housin'
Closed the mall down, dog, no one's allowed in
I'm coppin' everything I'm done with browsin' (gimme that)
It's the top don, Glock palm, dot com
Get your shit rocked mon like Hasim Rahman
And I'm extra scary
CEOs all the frontin' ain't necessary (why?), I fuck they secretaries
All for information, it ain't necessary
They in love like the 14th of February
Play 'em like April 1st right before I slide off
It could be March 2nd, sound like July 4th
Halloween or Memorial Day
At your memorial be one year from today (today)
All y'all think it's peace and peachy
I leave you reesy piecy, all my bitches rock
Christian Dior, BCBG, 'round phony niggas get the heeby jeebies
Hungry hoes say ""Killa feed me, feed me...""
Calm down ma, easy easy
Talk greasy, please me, get my man Weezy
Still rock Ellesses, to squeeze appease me
He ain't no tease but measly
Not Doggy's Angels, Killa, please believe me... uhh

Harlem World USA man
Take a walk with us on our block man
See how we live
Dipset

Yo, yo, uhh
Come on home with me, early '90s
It wasn't pearly and shining, I was certainly grimy
'Cause I ain't have no fresh clothes
Or jewelry with the X O's, my house had asbestos
I'm fixing up a 60 pack
Where the kitty cat? Mice run around the damn sticky trap
Come on home with me, where my mother found my crack platter
Threw it away so I snap at her, back slapped her
She picked up a bat like McGwire
For that matter hit me, I was back at her
Come home where I ducked the DTs
Lying around the corner, but I'm getting the free cheese
Come on home with me, where I stand on my post
Playing my toast, dinner there was mayonnaise and toast
And pepper, many nights I done slept with a hefa
Any beef came it left on a stretcher, Killa
Come on home with me, where they rap and be flossing
Where I beg Kim to have the abortion
Money brang back extortion, caution
Ain't no tracking an orphan, relax in a coffin
And the bitch know I'm serious, 'cause I'm never scared ma
Unless you miss your period, so come home with me
Where the girls wanna come home with me
They say ""Cam, if you need dome, hit me""
Love to see the chrome whippy
The car a quarter mil', on the wheels I done blown 50
Dice game blown 50, Jones loan 60
Head cracks thrown swiftly, took it home with me
So come home with me, where a nigga make star bucks
I'm about to cop a Starbucks, I reversed all my hard luck
Now I'm at the dealer buying cars, trucks
Awww shucks

Come home with me
To the streets, the slums, the ghetto, that's home to me
Every night my girl crying come home to me
No, come home with me, where there so many cops
The block is boiling and the food is spoiled
But that pot with the rock is boiling
Same pot mommy cook with, left the oil in
Come on home with me, where these bitches is frauds
Niggas don't listen to broads
They having you sitting in court for kids that ain't yours
Come home with me, where every day the Glocks go pop
Where the front door's broke and them locks don't lock
Come home with me, dog where the beef is seeking
Kids don't trick or treat, they get tricked for treating
Come home with me, where the pistol squeezing
Niggas twist ya cheek in, rip to pieces
Our kids get even, come home with me
Don't leave your condoms behind
'Cause them bitches leave the martians behind
Pray to God that I'm fine, come on home with me
Come on zone with me, come on walk through this cold city
Where these kids need food
Niggas need guidance and bitches need roofs
Come on home with me, where niggas living off they last bucks
Phone is off, rent is backed up
Come home with me, niggas strap up
Hit the street gats up, clack up and get they money back up
Come home with me, every block got a crack in it
Every hallway got a nigga with some crack in it
Don't get trapped in it

Uh, come on home with me, where my parents
Would um, leave me alone, so early I was free to just roam
7 keys to the home, 11 trees to the dome
13, I ran the streets with the chrome
Come on home with me, where the buses don't run
And my dogs stay busting they guns (billllllllllllappppppp)
Think that getting caught by Justice is fun?
Keep a blade up in the gums, this Harlem
Where the fuck is you from? Uh, come on home with me
Every few minutes, was a knock at the door
Fiends coming copping the raw, clothes, kicks, socks on the floor
Mommy like be quiet 'cause I really think them cops at the door
Is them locks on the door?
Come on home with me, where grandmothers is 30
One gram of that butter is 30
4 grand is my cut from the birdy, school cutting it early
Don't stutter motherfuckers you heard me, uh
Come on home with me, these are the facts
Steve Francis and Latifah got jacked
Mike Tyson punched Mitch Green in the face
Sarge snatched by the Feds, we was the case
No shit, he still pleading his case, come home with me
Hoes say, ""That's Jones with you
But I wouldn't take him home with you""
Come home with me, get stoned with me, be zoned with me
The chrome you see, the Jones you see

If she get pregnant again, it'd be from swallowing
But once in a while I dive in it
That car you bought I be driving it, head while I'm driving it

She need a nigga with Timbs, gats and straight hoodies

Yo, I got Timbs, dog
Yo dogs, what else she be saying dogs

Huh well.. huh
She said you gotta get drunk, and I could fuck her better sober
You get 20 grams, and think you fucking Erick Sosa
Better choke her, she the female Bill Clinton
Lie, cheat and smoke, you got her still sitting
Then she bouncing in, so you wanna pounce her in
She gas you up, ""I love you, I swear to God we'll go to counseling""
I ain't cherish ya cutie, inherit her booty
Have her wanting to kill you like American Beauty, Killa
'Cause you a motherfucking rest haven
I put a gun to her head, paint a picture like Wes Craven
Ya chest aching 'cause I'm very blunt, ya stunt, wanna cherry pump
Extra kid, a extra check every month

Tell you about ya hoe, she's a bitch
Came right between her lips
You thinking I'm fronting, she got a birth mark between her tits
And money, please stop calling niggas phones harassing
She come home, don't wanna fuck, we boned her back in
You's a creep, and all do is use your freak
And when we done, we send her home for you to keep
You want beef? Punk faggot, we got stupid heat
Ayo, you acting like you want die over pussy
I ain't gon' front, I was hazed up, high in the pussy
Yo, she greet me on GP, you buying the pussy
Breathing hard on the other line, dying to push me
Crime crime, sip fine wine, puff lime, lime
Laughing at the bitch on Primetime
Me and Killa for reala, all of the sudden you wan' be a guerilla
Nigga please, I'm quick to put three in a nigga
You ain't nothing but a sucka for love
She got you thinking it's love
Hit her on the sink and the tub
A little head crack, while a nigga drinking a bub'
You be surprised what ya bitch could do
She did shit to us, she never did to you
That hoe mad physical, cheesy bitch

Yo, give me the motherfucking phone nigga
This stupid ass nigga coming around here
Dialing my number, how the fuck he get the...
Listen nigga, ya BITCH ain't shit anyway
Her pussy no quality, and how the fuck you gonna take
This motherfucking ho to the Hotel?
She ain't nothin' but backseat, backshots
You talking about ""Oh I wanna soak ya feet baby
I had a long day, I wanna make you feel right""
She just got finished soaking my dick in her mouth nigga
You put time in this ho, ""Oh let me take her out Benihama's
Oh let me get some Dolce & Gabbana""
Motherfucker, I don't even know ya ho
She fucked me off my man deal

You running around trying get her some shit

And yo' bitch ain't shit, nigga
I done brought her to my house, fucked her
""Oh, put it in my ass, no, no, no, no not ya dick, ya whole fist""
I turned around, my pop's dick in her mouth

I know (fucking) with a crook is whack
I lied, cheated, still took me back
What I do? Turn around, ask you to cook me (crack)
Boost my work with a jerk and tell the truth it hurts
'Cause you even ask me to come through to church
What I do? Act second rate
I stole ten dollars out of the collection plate
But I'm ready to change
You got my heart, plus you smart
And the sex is great
And you hate rap, I like that girl
I argue with Keisha, I ain't like that girl
You jumped right out the car, to fight that girl
You beat her (ass), you ain't have to bite that girl
And my baby got the best thighs
And my whip she ain't never got to test drive
Copped her the X5
You paid attention when no one acknowledge me

On Fire Tonight,Come Home with Me,2002,"Uhh, uhh, wave your hands now (lighters in the sky)
Yo I'm looking for a hoe (word), found a hoe (and)
And the hoe ended up being, a hoe (what you thought?)
My man Zeke always told me a hoe's gon' be a hoe, let a hoe fly
Let the birds fucking fly, let 'em fly right Zeke, fuck
Let 'em fly away

Yo (holla), yo
I need a girl that can sing like Celina, ass like Trina
Tits like Janet, get beat like Tina, have you seen her?
I mean cake like Oprah, chauffeur
Keep the toaster in the holster, tell me have you seen her?
I did, yeah I found one, a little brown one
And she down son, plus she pushed a Beamer
I should've knew something was up from the jump
When I passed ma the blunt, the bitch was a steamer
I ain't care I had weed to blow
I ain't feed the hoe, we took a trip to Argentina
I don't know why a guy would pause
I went raw inside the whore, I thought she would be cleaner
Dirty bitch burnt me, that concerned me
Now I'm thirsty, I'm looking for her with the nina
I'ma kill her when I see her
So tell me have you seen her, tell me have you seen her?

It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight
It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight (tonight...)

Yo, it's like treat her like a prostitute (prostitute)
Don't treat no girly good, don't ever show her ya loot
Girly see you riding wanna roll in the coupe
See you a ice cream want you to throw her a scoop
I don't get mad tell her to blow on my flute (suck a dick, bitch)
Before the I-E, you gotta throw in the group, groupie
Sad I read it, woo wee I'm glad you deaded
Sue me, what, you mad I said it?
'Cause front, back, side to side
Never let a broke ass female ride
I learnt that down South, niggas in Texas
Before I trick, I buy bigger baguetteses
Imagine me get her baguetteses, get her a Lexus (not me)
You figuring reckless, baby I'm sexist
So back up, let me strap up
Before you give Cam that clap up, I'm gon' have to clack up

And why the nigga still going raw?
This for my niggas out here who DO use the condom
For the first night...
Then go raw all the other times
Where the psychological sense in that player?
You need to wash your face, get your mind right
Girls out here is burning
The bitch burnt the braids off my nigga the other week....
Yeah, yeah, I know what to do
I'ma get the pussy ATM started
Before anything happens your gotta swipe your pussy across this board
Let you know what's going on
What type of temperature you running
'Cause I can't stand niggas running out here to the clinic sitting down talking 'bout ""Nah it ain't nuttin Zeek, I'm over here getting condoms""
Nigga, I seen you break the door down running to the nurse talking 'bout ""Help me, HELP ME!""
You damn right I'ma help you
I'm gonna hang your stupid ass right in front of the damn clinic
The hell you gonna give my girl 'niece this got damn venereal disease, huh!
Her pussy lighting up like some damn light bulb...'
20 watt light bulb... shit, light bulb?
What type of, engineer, venereal disease is going on down nowadays
These bitches is crazy, niggas is crazy
You need to write a book on how stupid niggas is

It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides
Pretty thighs, but what about they insides
And that bitch is a liar and dyke
I took the condom off, now it's on fire tonight
It be the girls with the pretty face and the pretty rides

When you meet a chick, you gotsta straight slap her

Slap her?

Off the bat?

Off the bat, just backhand her

Why's that, though?

Cause later on down the line
You ain't never gotsta to worry about
That chick telling you --
""Cam, you don't treat me the way you used to""

{*Laughing*} That's what I'm saying, nigga
But see the thing is with me
I don't understand how a bitch can go out
Rain, sleet, snow, fuck, suck whoever
And then go give another nigga her fucking money

The Rag Muffin y'all soon say
Y'all fuck around with brother Num-say
Y'all gon' see doomsday
I'm a savage but colder
Now I rock karats that I'm older
See this parrot on my shoulder?
He do the talking, I ain't concerned with words
Act up, and be returned to the birds
I return with them birds, any 28 grams
A bitch that I touch, pretty much turns to birds
I be in Miami, Boca Raton, poking your moms
Her and ya aunt all over the Don
Using a dope then I'm gone, back
Copacabana, no joke I'm bananas
Cops come for dope it's a damper
I'm low in Atlanta, get hot, go to Savana
Rush the crib, go in the hamper
Don't follow me, ""Stan-a""
If you do, I'm blowing the hammer
That'll rip that vest apart, hit ya chest and heart
I ain't finished, that's just the start
You'll be calling for back up, praying for help
Fuck my life, I'm taking myself
All the aching I felt
In my crib at night, praying for wealth
Bitches dissing, ""What's the problem ma? I ain't balling?""

Killa, yo, yo
Cops bagged me 1 night, looking for the blow
Went from Bronx house to bookings, bookings to the show
From the show to the crib, to the kitchen cooking Os
Kitchen to the car, to the street looking for hoes
Looking for hoes, to straight up bagging 1
From my game in her brain, in the wagon, hun (in the wagon bitch)
From the wagon, garage to the house
Dining room, kitchen, kitchen to the couch
Couch to the bedroom, my dick's in her mouth
Bedroom to front door, this bitch getting out (see ya)
Front door, to ""You know where the Jacuzzi is?""
Dress cooley, but usually the Coogi kid, bouchie kid
Tell ya boo-bee, a doo-bee did
She a houchie groupie Cooley is
Who am I? Come on, can't be for-reala
Went from Cam to Killa, Killa to scrilla, gorilla
From Killa to skyscrapers, from skyscrapers
To high papers, that's my nature
Do five you now, y'all die later
Come to your wake, look at you; ""Hi hater""
From the wake to lot, another boogie
From the lot to the hill, to cop something ugly (ugly)
From the hill to that state Dakota
From Dakota to the corner, get that baking soda, Killa

Lloyd, Floyd, Roy, Soy, Black British
Bitches too, joy toy, what
Cat like you? Call you a Gladiator
Give her oral, and you happy, Glad-he-ate-her (stupid)
Put nine on the pussy, she a masturbator
Then my dick in her mouth, that's what fascinate her
I'm a legend now, passed a player, passed it player
Got the rock? Pass it player
I'm like Betty Crocker with cake, that's in layers
I had city issues before, ask the mayor (ask him)
He said, ""Cam'ron, please stop this crack behavior""
(Shut the fuck up, man)
He ain't know '96, I had a knack for Gators
I come through, laugh at haters, bitches too
Wanna act, sit back, relax a player
'Cause all these hoes jelly you hard
When your purelius are hard
And the Chanel, skelles to Scarfs
Have 'em sick to their stomachs, their belly's will barf
And I take them to the telly where their belly will force
""Why fucking me like that? Calm down that's my uterus
My cervix, my ovaries"", relax, I'm doing this
Welcome to exclusiveness
You about to take a week off, the ultimate freak off
Hit Jimmy, Juelz, Sean, and Zeke off
Wait a minute ma', wipe that cum on your cheek OFF
I hate me a filthy hoe, but I like me a silly hoe
That way you really blow
Having to fuck cats, she don't really know
Then take all her money; you don't feel me, though
You don't understand my pimp-ery
You love them you got sympathy, fuck that, I'm into me

I been on both sides of burglaries, guns out and choked up
Man, this shit'll get you choked up
I had been shot at, got at, back-stabbed, coked up
Almost doped up, but had no guts
So I pimp all these hoe sluts
When they period come it get slow, but so what
I got big plans to blow up
I'ma love this year, but Blood ain't here
We would puff grass, plus hash, cut class
To fuck ass, dough, we had enough cash
Little cats, he would see y'all dreams
18 with the 3-18, that's Blood y'all (Blood y'all...)
He had hot gear, rocks yeah
Now that he's not here, I feel that it's not fair
Fuck see him at the crossroads, wanna see him drive across road
Poor, stole, then floss mo', had to tell a few niggas
""My man was a hell of a nigga"", swell with the triggers
Whatever ethnic problem dog, better check it
Little Cam, it's just Bloodshed resurrected
Death to birth, ""logic"" I said
Four months, got him some head, right in the bed
Listen dog, I'm beyond dead
This ain't even me spittin', this Derek Michael Armstead

For my fam, keep it up, those that fell, pick them up
Keep it here, that's what's up, tomorrow's not promised
To my streets, hold it down, all these hoes, hold your ground
Let's not wait, get it now, tomorrow's not promised, no

I just had fight for rings, ice and bling
I done spent nights in bings
Now I realized Christ the King, ain't no righteous thing
But how I get the right to sing?
And the streets be talking like Donahue
Clowns, they belong on Comic View
That's why the Feds onto you
When they form they assembly's
You stuck on the block like the Ave. got parenthesis
'Cause everybody gotta war story (shit)
I swear to God, I hear more and more stories (damn)
I'm in Jersey, the crib, 4 stories
Add a fifth one in case the 4th 1 bore me (Killa!)
I done ran through the NBC's, CBS's, 3GS's, VVS's
Baguettes, princess cuts, diamond layers
And I never said, ""I'm a player""
But I been down with messy action
Similar to Jessie Jackson, regret what happen
Ma kept resisting, I had to bounce with my shipment
I'm scared of commitment
I'm a hustler, work in the closet, work in the kitchen
Outside, working them pigeons, work on the block
Even put in work with the Glock
Work on the toilet, I'ma workaholic

For my fam, keep it up, those that fell, pick them up
Keep it here, that's what's up, tomorrow's not promised
To my streets, hold it down, all these hoes, hold your ground

'Til when? ('Til the early morn')

Confessions,Confessions of Fire,1998,"(Cam) Father
(Minister) Yes my son
(Cam) Forgive me for I have sinned
Its been 21 years since my last confession
(Minister) 21? That seems like a very long time for
You to miss confession my son
(Cam) Yeah, but I'm only 19
(Minister) 19?
(Cam) Yeah
(Minister) Thats interesting
(Cam) Yeah, its like I just have these dreeeamz, and you know
Verse 1
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo father, where you wanna start
How I love ladies
Or how I'm slug crazy
Or how I'm a thug maybe
From a drug baby
I need more than just a slight high
I mean father I'm blind out my right eye
Don't mourn and cry
Cause we were born to die
So fuck mom and father cries
I was one never to bother guys
But when my girl got sodamized
I was dramatized
Shoved the dick down her throat and
Told her it was a taste test and
Take a deep throat so she wouldn't have to waste breath
I mean they fucked her and stuck her
I said man fuck a AIDS test
Cause I'm gon' go raw anyway
I'm one that like to chase death
But that guy, got to get him hit
Wild hairs and tattoos and spanish
Wait, wait, wait, who that description fit
Don't give me chrome for Jenny Jones
My man with the crime sheet
But he kept talkin bout my girl was a dime piece
And she had a nice figure
Drove a nice Vigor
And for mr to bag her
That I had to be a nice nigga
Wait, wait, don't appall me yo
I can't jump to conclusions thats all we know
But his wife did use to call me yo
Now I roll for the hell
I'm sorry father
Let me go head and tell
How I really wanna be old in a cell
See my two year old nephew
I swear I was holding him well
Til he cried, and he cried, and he cried
I had to scold him and yell
Ya know one thing led to another
I said oh what the hell
Then I threw him against the wall
His parents I told them he fell
Thats why I'm going to hell
This shit ain't going that well
Too many things I did that aren't loose
Smoke and leaks like giving a car a boost
My grandfather got me mad
And I peed inside his orange juice
And asked him if its tangy
When I'm angry
Then one day
When I thought it wasn't a sin left
I ran into my aunt
With the fat ass and the thin chest
I don't really wanna talk about it
Or get in depth
But father I'm gon' leave you
With this last word called incest
(Cam) You know what I'm sayin'?
(Minister) My son, my son, remember the words of the Lord
Isaiah chapter 59, verse 1, behold, the Lords hands is not shortened
That it cannot hear, but your enipirings have separated
Between you and your God, and your sins hath speakath
Boastfully, that he will not heal
Verse 2
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
See father I lost my scruples
Went straight banoodles
When I raped that putu
And tried to turn the putu
Into, veh, Oodles of Noodles
Now I'm chased by the voodoos
See what that dust does
I love that Vanessa heffa
But I jerk off 'til I bust blood
Oh yeah I got my balls pierced
And my psychiatrist I ain't seen him all year
He........
(Cam singing)
Hey little baby don't you cry
Mama gon' make sure you get high
Put that vodka in your milk
Make sure that your bottle filled
Oh that was just a little song my mother
Sang when she was stressed yo
I don't know why she got mad when I cry
If the bitch deaf yo
Who the F know
But death row
I'm coming by the inches
And them niggas outside on the benches
Don't think that we in the trenches
Cause we got a 600
And we ride like the Princess
But my cousin Blood yo he died like the Princess
20 years old and dead
BMX days he played the front
I rolled the pegs
My girl wanna know why I'm cold in bed
Tellin' me to hold my head
Askin' why I scold my kids
Cause I don't want them litlle muthafuckas
To touch the drugs I sold and did
But fuck it I'll take my own life
And cut a vein Black
Why don't you do like the cartoons
And tie me up to the train tracks
Or fuck the glory
Why don't you drop me from the 6th story
That'll be a sick story
Wait, wait, wait, speaking of sick stories
Oh father don't start me tweakin
I don't wanna talk about that Sunday evening
That cold November weekend
When I had to grab that Deacon
And put him into my dungeons of heathens
And then in tongues I was speakin
(Cam speaking in tongues)
Then I woke up to loud preaching
Oh thats just the Pastor
Flippin through the Bible
Reading the scriptures on the rapture
I guess it was my soul he was trying to capture
He missed me by a hairbone fracture
But he wanted to lay me down in a green pasture
But yet aiya
Still feel like I'm in a bed of fire
Like Jebaniah
Y'knaw I'm sayin cause
It's like Daniel trapped in a lion's pit
Father I feel like I'm dying quick
Thats why I ain't shit
(Cam) So, could you just please fuckin' help me please?
(Minister) My son, my son
(Cam) Please
(Minister) I understand that you're stressed my son, but
Don't forget the words of the Lord my son, which reads....",https://genius.com/Camron-confessions-lyrics
Rockin’ and Rollin’,Confessions of Fire,1998,"Ay yo you wonder who I are
I guzzle up at the bar
But you see me in the cars that start with the double R
Range Rover, Rolls Royce, even got a Rocky Rolly
See more ice than a hockey goalie
Baby eating guacamole
I did without
Now I live it out
Cars? got to whip it out
Every year I get it out
(Why?) I be long gone
(Where?) probably Hong Kong
Girls with their thong on
I'm playing Don Juan
Drinking Chandon
Where the chron, ma?
""You smoke weed?"" ""What you think, girl? Uh-huh!""
Start the car up
Take her on a long ride
Yo she think my steering wheel on the wrong side
No I'm sorry
This is the Ferrari
Limon like Bacardi
Rock with safari
But la di da di
We like to party
And every night, believe, we gon' leave with somebody

We was rockin' and rollin'
Now we rollin' and smokin'
On the phone and we chokin'
While you strollin' and hopin'
For the tone which you spoke in
And I know that you're open
Live a Branson life and a brand new 5
Hot man, God damn, Killa Cam be live

Ay yo come on, girlfriend I ain't no actor, really
So when you come around here don't be acting silly
Askin ""did he?""
Come on I got the baddest biddies
Ass is pretty
Like hoes down in Magic City
Now you smoke hoes and the coco
Niggas say I'm loco
Cause I'm low low from the po-po
Every night I stroke hoes
No-no for homos
F doing promos
I was Def already I just added the So-So
Wherever we at
Ready to act
Better be strapped
I live the life of Riley
Whether Teddy or Pat
And when it come to the cash
Bet I'm heavy with that
If your man want to bet
Then I bet he be cracked
And your little girlfriend
She was wet off the bat
From the Chevy tonight;
Yo, I'll bet she be back
For the one night stand
Yeah, the sex in the sack
Yo I ask her if she miss it
Then I tell her to kiss it
Come on


Ay yo your girl around me? That's like sand to a beach
Or a gram to a ki or a branch to a tree
Your money? That's my advance to a G
And you'll see me and Lance to the B
Yeah acting wild
Jimmy back me, child
How long you think an ounce gonna last me now?
But I love when hoes call me
""The Cat's Meow""
Cause I run up in them and I make their cats meow
Are you hip to the jive?
How we get to the thighs?
Half of my game? Yo, that shit be a lie
But it's true about Duke from the hoop to the 5
And I'm right behind him in a coupe that we drive
Baby am I slick
Oh your friends are sick
To see me and my chicks in DKNY kicks
And my clique
Yo we get the dank and bounce
And put another half a mil in my bank account",https://genius.com/Camron-rockin-and-rollin-lyrics
D Rugs,Confessions of Fire,1998,"This song goes out to all the teens across America man
Who livin' in single parent homes and they mother or father wanna pick they boyfriend or girlfriend over you
Remember parents, kids don't ask to be born
My story goes a little bit deeper, come up about '88

Yo, this nigga named d-rugs
My moms dates him
Swear to God I hate him
If I could I would break him
When he comes around, her brain sizzles like a Steakum
Damn, can't jakes take him
She neglected me
Run around with this punk nigga recklessly
Had him in her tummy
Guess she was in ecstasy
For his love
Took the best of me
O-d'd excessively
That's her boyfriend
Or her toyfriend see
Let me specify
Her last man
Took the money
Left the guy
Desert dry
And gave it to d-rugs
He kept her high
When he come around
See her facial
Guess it was his fragrance
She sniffed it in her nasal
She wouldn't even listen
I told her he ain't faithful
Fuckin' wit Aunt Rachel
Ya'll so dumb
Makin' me look disgraceful
He got a girl named Hazel
And another white one
With him it ain't racial

I'm your mama
I'm your daddy
I'm that nigga
In the alley
I'm your doctor
When in need
I'm your coke
I'm your weed
You know me
I'm your friend
Your main boy
Thick and thin
I'm the monster in your dreams
For my love
You will fiend

What the deal dun?
It's '91
Moms still strung
On this nigga d-rugs
His game's tight
Every night in the room she screw him
Yeah she do him
But my man Un knew him
Schooled me to him
Told me he got mad hoes
He used to pimp him
He can get you mad doe
What you mean?
Yo it's more than just your mother
He's got other partners
He's a foreigner though
The cops don't like him
Illegal alien
Can't even say his name on the phone
But you can get money with him
Then leave him alone
Or you'll be inside the new cuffs
Plus a news rush
Told some more about him
Then he introduced us
Took me to the block where everybody get him off
Showed me his clientele
Ever since - hit it off
He was right
D-rugs got dumb freaks
Men and women love him
Got me 10 grand in one week


Now it's '98
D-rugs, he payed me well
500 S-E-L
Got me land in A-T-L
It's all swell
Way beyond a felony
But now that we together
I think my mom is jealous
Cause he with me now
And see the way I G him
But when it comes to her
She even pay to see him
Yo, money excites me
But my niggas on the block
They got shysty
Cause I'm wit d-rugs
They don't like me
Tried to snipe me
Right before the damn feds had indicted me
You know my mother
Her nostrils wide
Too much of d-rugs left her hospitalized
We both was arrested
Stars of the block
Her by cardiac
Me by the cops
But for my mother
Yo it's nothin' but love
But that's what we get--fuckin' with drugs",https://genius.com/Camron-d-rugs-lyrics

Click, clack, uhh
Since day one been in a ditch
Kin with a snitch
Now I'm in the pen in the mix
Friends sending me flicks
Girls sending me kicks
Been in some shit
Had to tap a chin with a fist
When the ?
Begin with a stitch
End in a kiss
So yo so I blend in the mix
Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
8½ on the dope ask Dominican Rich
Winning and rich
Eating on cinnamon grits
Grinning and shit
How a nigga spin in 6
See they all see the 12
But you see me in it
TVs in it
B be kitted
Ask who it is
You see me tinted
I did drive-bys
Now I take you on top of a high rise
See if you can sky dive
I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
How 'bout the Palladium
Fuck it Yankees Stadium uhh

I got dudes that'll jig you with a AIDS needle
You not a threat
You want it you got it bet
I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet
Nigga when I’m upset
I'll go another route
Kidnap your family make you brother eat your mother out
After I done dug her out
Needles to drug her out
Pillows to smother out
You don't give a fuck about, I'm what a thug about
I'm through with it
Your crew ain't even true with it
I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
I know you pack like that
But Cam why you act like that
Shut up nigga clack clack clack
Pat pat pat
Rat tat tat
Put fear 'fore envy
Nigga I'm not in fear of any
I'll leave a nigga black and blue
Like a pair of Pennys
While 
me and Betha
Throw fiestas
By alma queta
Chicqueta, monero, nieta
Don't ever fuck around with the Don's cheddar
See Jimmy Jones frontin' in the chancletas
Or the black boots, jumpin’ out to act cool
Cars never lease 'em
Girls ? 'em
My man and his wifey want me down with the threesome
Niggas tease 'em
Bitches please 'em
When I'm out of town yo my pants gotta crease 'em
All calls valid
Never hard mallet
Dallas
Been up in your favorite star's stylist
Coward
Bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
But you should thank Un though
Coulda made you run though
Been at your front door
Gun hold for fun though

What's up?

Fuck that it's not a game

Everytime you look up a gat
Got you shook up attack huh
Look in the back, nah
The guns I had put in the back
I want the hook up in check
On this work of the rap
Now I'm not saying what I like
Or what I dislike
But get the fuck out my face til' your shit's right
See baby boy I carry guns, you know the big type
The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life
And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
But nowadays I'm a owner, you a runningback
You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
I get pure white coke from Columbian cats
Or the cocaine plan
Leave your whole brain dead
Light this herb
Don't mean to disturb
Never been to Sesame Street but I flip a big bird
And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh
No kids rapping or ostriches
Just kidnappings and hostages

It's like I got a habit
Gotta keep the drug game
Why
Until we blow up with that ol' platinum thug thing
Ey yo what you think lame nigga I feel the same
Cause I be outside nigga, cocaine and me
But if it ain't about money then it ain't about me
Well I ain't in poverty and no one's starving me
Cause when we first felt heat we sought robbery
Now, ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
I know y'all ain't gonna come out and front like that
When yall got knocked, yall was dying in jail
The way you keep on calling, crying for bail
Acting like criminals, yall some fake generals
What you know abut bail being more than ten thousand (Cam: nah nah nah)
Peep the old way, how I done sold cake
Behind the closed drapes, on one of your old plates
And the tubes of Colgate
Two and four states, yeah I can verify
Man a nigga never lie
Go head wit your killer schemes
Nah we gotta iller dreams
Land in the Philippines I got about four mil a piece
Kiddies on the corner, they got a lil' team
And they keep frontin
Are they gonna jump me too
I wish they would
Jump me please jump me too
That's what I'm sayin with y'all
Monkey see monkey do
Now y'all niggas can see why I want to plead insanity

I might pull the silks out
But I'll do your body good cause you know I'm illed out
I took an ill route, I might pull some krills out
Cause that cash and the weed, you know I'm still about
Well what you want baby, a description of me
I'm frontin with the ladies having you picture me
Well I'm tattooed out with a scroll of my fam
And the long sliky hair with the bow legged stands
You in my V in the rear
, on the low from your man
Yo I do many things but I ain't holdin your hand
Do you know how to scuba
I got a house in Aruba
But you keep it on low cause my spouse got a Ruger
Yo you see I ain't dumber, on me some type of tutor
Cause I been had the info, on the whores wit the hooters

Get out my house cause I will shoota
Federica I will step to her
Senorita know how I maneuver
Mamasita sip margarita
Messin with Cam you get punched in your mouth
Only key you ever had was the one to your house
F a spouse me single, I'm one of the ones
You think Cam's nice he's a son of a gun
Cause I have heaters before them sneakers
When Run had Adidas and reefer was cheeba
Although I'm an entity
All those crooked crooks down town remember me
Second home one hundred tenth street

You remind me of your daddy

And you remember that stank bitch hittin' the deck

Yeah that's when your pretty ass ate coochie free though

And I took you off canal right down to Tito's

But when the cops pulled us over I had to keep the heat low

But I gave you the money to pay off the repo

A-yo you real funny

Yo you know how we go

Yeah, motherfucking peoples

Uh, without the egos

And I'll do anything for you, even give my last breath
I wish you the best

Man I love you to death
Chorus 1
I don't care what they think about us
I don't care what they say
I don't care if they think that we're fucking
I only love you this way

Don't care about the way girls thinking you twistin' my back
Bought the chrome almost so you can christen the Ac'
In '91 when you was young and I was dumb and
Robbing niggas splittin' the figgas wit you boo, screw who?
Incest, never dissed a kiss
Shine on your wrist for a birthday gift
Niggas like, you must've bent that
She never would've spent that
On Cam'Ron I bought me my first box of tampons
Bleeding in the pants at the school dance
Never took a chance at romance
Although all my friends think ya fly
But me doing that, I think I'd die
We like Thelma and JJ, Brandy and Ray J
Anyone against C and C, pulled a AK
Thinkin' 'bout sucking your dick, had me sick
But if I lost my mind, you'd be the first I'd lick
Chorus 2
I don't care if they try to avoid us
I don't care what they do
I don't care about anything else but
Me and you boo, me and you boo, me and you boo

A-yo I'm sorry yo
But when it come to Charli
I wouldn't hit that, we got back like Atari
How you live mister?
Yo you see me and CB she a wig twister
Call her my big sister
She game heads
Never wear the same threads
I wouldn't hit that if we slept in the same bed
Fucking wit her, yo shit get sliced
Her wrist is ice
And rappin', the bitch is nice
She told me how girls fool you for the bucks
And I should stay low, cool up in the cut
I told her the difference
A wooler from the blunt
That's how we get down
So cool I call her Cha'
And any girl next to her, just to run her up
That's why y'all run a muck
Thinkin' that I done her up
I thought about it once
When we grew up
But then I saw her naked
And I threw up

Ohhh, on and on and on

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, why stay here when all y'all don't play fair?
Wanna disrespect, slit ya neck, spit the tech (Ohhh)
Yellin' out, ""Baby hit the deck"", and all the people
See my face on all the TV's
Laid out like Castellano on a war with Thoebe (Ohhhh)
And to my family? Y'all all are greedy
Yeah my mother, I can't judge her
I love her, but trust her, she a sucka (Ohhh)
Went D Rugs when I turned around
Ready to lock her in the liquor store and burn it down
Or at least give her a tumor to kill the rumors (Yeahhh)
How she a coke consumer, and my girl too slick
Acting goody two shoes like she don't do spit (Ohhh)
I knew it, no bluffin', no fussin' or nothin'
After all, I'm the one that was up in her cousin (Hmmm)
But she got a girl in the world
F a boyfriend, I don't know if I'm mad or if I should join in
Like the movie flicks (Ohhh)
And all my tempers with the hoochie lit (Ohhh)
I tell 'em you be quick
My grandmother need her rubies fixed
And some Gucci chips
She think I'm paid cause she heard me with the Fugee clique (Ohh)
All the money she want?
I tell her, ""Sue me quick
Why don't you shoot me quick
Do it tasteful and graceful."" Hateful
My grateful behalf (Hmm)
Now my girl is crying pregnant
Look it and laugh (Ohh)
No, and I ain't seen 'em last in a year and a half
But they hand open
Prepared for the cash (Yeah)
But y'all don't offend me, my ends be
Buried out in the Indies, too bad I'm stingy

On and on the rain will fall (Sometimes)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child
On and on the pain will fade (On and on, oh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are (We are so fragile)

Yo, yo, yo (Yeaah)
Yo, you got a best friend? Me too, mine's in heaven
My man Blood Deedee left in '97 (Ohhh)
C'mon how that sound, yo
Put my man in the ground, y'all
Cause he let a girl be his downfall
We would slide together
In a ride together (Ohhhh)
What you know about Blood, and even my endeavors
How we cried together, vowed to lie together
I wish I was in the whip, we coulda died together (Ohhh)
Like the charm, love is gone
I ain't bleedin' but I got Blood on my arm
Cause what happen when you die
You miss one or two treats
One or two weeks
One or two beeps
One or two peeps (Ohh)
Cats like you?
Miss one or two freaks
Them hoes gon' cry
For one or two weeks (Yeahhh)
My life is like a car race
No brakes, just gas
Goin' real fast
Probably land in a crash (Ohhh)
Like my cousin, perhaps, for a dozen and black
Harlem buzzin' in fact, prayin' I wasn't the cat (Yeahhh)
But haters lovin' the fact, can't stay on my toes
And I be layin' in low, got me blazin' my Os (Ohhhh)
Yeah, I sound wet
But lounge yet
Playa lay it down bet
Y'all be tryin to J and I ain't even in the ground yet (Hmmm)
And this verse? I put my heart in it
I love you Blood Deedee (I love you)
I'll see you in a minute (Ohhh)

On and on the rain will fall (Sometimes)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child
On and on the pain will fade (On and on, oh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are (We are so fragile)
On and on the rain will fall (Sometimes)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child
On and on the pain will fade (On and on, oh)
How fragile we are, how fragile we are (We are so fragile)
On and on the rain will fall (Sometimes)
Like tears from a child, like tears from a child

I'm about to lace ya'll
Check it out
I'm not a muthafuckin' joke b!
Whoever think I'm not nice
This is for ya'll punk muthafuckas!
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!
See the drug game was always the man's sport
That's what Cam thought so everyday I had a hundred grams bought
On the transport kept it inside the Jansport
A real hooty game, we ain't care who we blame
Shit was all the same until Guili' came with a moody aim
You know the mayor nigga, a fight crime approach
Acting like a kind host but gettin time for a roac
h
A little indo
That's when yo, I said I'm messin with these bimbos
It's easier to pimp hoes, nowadays they simp ho
It don't take much to make her
Just take her to a place where It's nice
Show her the ice
 and might give her a fake fur
Cause girls I control them classy
Old and nasty
Bold and sassy
I ain't gonna front that nigga Gold he gassed me
But now I'm flowin fastly, rollin jazzy
Just a while ago I was rollin badly
We was on the low wit Aggie
But now what have we
Range Ro' and Navy life size
My girl yo she slices pies
A benz is what my wife drives
You know Qeet' nigga
Executive thug
Yet she respected and loved
Don't let your head meet her slug
Until she sprayed out and layed out
Ineffections of blood
A lil' thick chick that'll click quick
Do anything for the dick dick
And know what else that puzzles me?
I find this shit a riddle
How come when you got a lot?
People say you got a little
Like they say you act a little funny
Cause you got a litte honnies
And you did a little song and
Made a little money
Oh, you know my favorite
Oh, you think you a little star
Cause you got a little fans and you drive a little car
I prove they all are liars
Saying that they got a fire
Hang em up on a barber wire
Yo, you think you got attire
To the point like Stoudamire
Yeah I'm a harsh nigga
That drink hard liquor
A six benz car getter
You know Digga
He ain't rich
He's a star figure
Platinum deep
Hangs with Jews
Chills up at their barmitzfah's
He loves the hooligans
Now we eat at houlihans's
Seen Ed Lover and Doctor Dre
We told them niggas Who the Man
Pulled the toast out on these niggas one time
And even Cuda ran
You know that I'm a skitzo
Who listens to calypso
But I'm quick though
And old school like Hungry Hungry Hippo
Ask my Queens niggas how I get dough kiko
Now I beat up clicks, eat up chicks
Ask my man how I beat up shit
And when I'm out of work, I got to re-up quick
Every six the same pies, every Cris' to St. Ides
Every hit my bank rise, and no bitch I ain't high!
I've been hotter
Since I was in pampers hittin pinatas
You win nada
Come on I got put on by Mase and Big Poppa
So I'm glad you sat down
I ain't want Uncle Un to bring the gats down
He spat rounds, I heard that nigga clap towns
But me I never back down
My mother, she can sign that

 The Death

Ayo, I'm hit with at least ten, beat again
Hey Cam'Ron need a friend?
Aww man, we meet again
Here's your suit and tie your laced with the gear
You the same motherfucker I been chasing for years
Don't take you why not? Cause you rhyme now?
Listen here, motherfucker lie down
Yo yo chill, it ain't my time now
Come on last year you had me ducking the blaze
What about that bitch that you fucked with AIDS?
Aww shit come on death I ain't know that
You know I wouldn't of went up in that bitch kojak
Yeah, but her ass was so fat
But let's go back to when your ass stole cracks
But I was a little cat that ain't know jack
So I know that, but let's go black
When they put you in the trunk of the gold hatch
Oh yeah, with the cold rats
But back then I even came back with rabies
But you still living that was way back in the 80's nigga
But yo, you tried to get me once when my house caught on fire
So I let you go when your girl called you a liar
And choked you with your necklace
And what about when your ass drove wreckless?
Wha-what in the Lexus?
Come on now I'm thinking of Blood in the BM
Well, I know where he at nigga yo you wanna see him?
Ayo, don't play with me nigga you'll get lead in your head
Yo shut up, nigga you bout to die you can't kill me I'm dead
This is how I get extortion
I coulda got your ass when you was a portion
Mom wanted abortion
Yo, why didn't you come get me when my time was done?
When I didn't have a penny and I was confined to crumbs?
When I wanted to kill myself and couldn't find a gun
Oh yeah that time you was beeping me 911
But to me that was petty
But now I ain't ready
Man, Cam hurry up I got to go get little Betty
Me and her got a little 2:00 appointment
She playing with wires while she eating on a ointment
Yo, but I don't wanna even join the casket crew
Too bad motherfucker I'll be back in a few

 3x
I swear to God I feel like death is fucking calling me
But nah, you wouldn't understand

The Death

Oh, you slid up on me
Ayo Death, hurry up before they give up on me
It's your time, it's your time
Ayo Death I forsake you, I ain't trying to snake you
Well, why shouldn't I take you?
Well, I understand I stole bottles
But nowadays I'm the one the little bros follow
Yo I'm like a role model and my girls pregnant
Look don't hand me the game
Yo for real I don't wanna see my family in pain
Look, Cam, man, shut up
But, but
What? What?
Yo man, that's fucked up
Yeah, well tough luck
Ayo just show me the light and get me through the fog
What about Mr. Diggs and Jimmy and the God?
Oh, your crew after you left they got a little chest hair
After hard rocks yo they'll meet you here next year
Ayo, what happened to them?
You know, niggas on the hill snipped them
Ayo, why they just ain't fight them?
See funerals I like em you see family and friends
Yeah don't forget the snitches
While you looking for them man I m looking for the bitches
And you don't need no ends, and nigga no friends
I'm just gonna go wit you I ain't got no wins
Let me get my shit man I'll go check it
Matter fact death you got to give me one second
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
And if I die.....
Ayo man, cut the crap man just get your shit man and that'll be that
Man fuck it death I'm ready to go lying in the ditch
Aw Cam yo you always fucking crying like a bitch
I ain't gonna take you your life you can have that
Just wanted to waste time you someone to laugh at
Ayo why you fuck with me? Just give me one answer
Ayo I see you next album with my man lung cancer

Feels Good,Confessions of Fire,1998,"Eh yo, why am I gonna sit here and let ya'll bug me
Cause I met a dime and the girl is lovely
And though we in love she ain't all luvy-duvy
Smacks me on the ass and says fast nigga fuck me
Don't worry if my babygirl trust me
I don't do nothing for her to bust me
I would love her if her rings were rusty
Feet were crusty
And arms were musty
Cause ain't nobody gettin that--just me
And ain't nobody hittin that--just me
If I cheat I know that she will bust me, crush me
Cause she know how many girls lust me
Back in the day they wouldn't even touch me
Now they say they don't want nobody but me
To tell the truth
Them girls just disgust me
Cause I already found the one that love me

It's all good
Lovin' somebody
As long as somebody loves you back

Mess with her?
I ain't have to
But player I was glad to
Brownskin dove
But her love won't pass you
Promised her a ring
Along with a shine
Never stressin my rhyme
All she wanted is time
Where she find me at
Cause I'm a grimy cat
Puffin dime sacks to see where my mind be at
And you know the game a nigga got, I told her yo
I don't always have to hit the twat, ust to get you hot
You don't believe me
Then pick a spot
But remember, I lick a lot
Ayyo she likes to trick a lot
Cause she got a bigga knot
Loves to see her nigga hot
Worries if I'm jigged or not
And her stuff--hot and divine
And the things she coppes--top of the line
Baby is hot and divine
Always poppin some wine
And then she told me
Cam, I got a rock on my mind


It feels good when you love em'
And they lovin you back
Go tit for tat
Never scratch your back
Matter of fact she touches and grabs
Not to lust you bad
Just to get you mad
When we alone she screams and moans
She don't front on me
Cause she don't want to be alone
Come on
Everybody needs somebody
Spanish girls screamin out
Ay Papi!
Take her out
Uh-huh no doubt
Then we lace her out
Uh-huh no doubt
Then we ski her out
Ski her out
Then we eat her out
Eat her out
Come on, where your man at?
Where's your plans at?
You ain't go away this year
Where your tan at?
Cause me and ma just came from the tropics
Wit her legs cocked
And she begging me to stop it",https://genius.com/Camron-feels-good-lyrics

Ayyo a Pimps a Pimp
Flow is flow
Doe is do
Ho's a ho
Chic's a chic
Trick's a trick
Bitch a bitch across the world
So, nigga, getcha money and attend to your girl

Now when it comes to these hoes I did'em I got'em
Rip'em and rock'em
But if I hit'em I pop'em
But if I lick'em I lock'em
And I ain't famous at all
Let my game tell it all
But they a pain in my balls
Got to train'em like dogs
From how they, walk and they talk and when they sit on the couch
To how they, lick in they mouth and never shit in the house
But I make ladies wit babies, let the street drive em crazy
They say ""Cam, good you saved me"" Now I pimp em and they pay me
They feelin' it like Jay-Z, on Sugar Hill like AZ
Went _Party Time_ like Tray Lee, I'm SoSoDef like J.D
Oh baby they have you stressed, nigga
Mad depressed
I want they mind...Muthafucka, you could have the rest
Cause I gas'em up, I tell them I'm more than just the lover
I want to be your friend, father, confidant and brother
See my, nine-inch slugger now she, chose her devotion
With messing with my money, girl you messing with my emotion
Chorus x 1
Now baby-cakes what's you're name?
(Ain't no need to explain)
Why is that?
(Cause I'm from Down South)
Well I got Down South game
And to mess wit' you this my last attempt
Cause I only like when you're ass is bent
So damn dumb you ain't stash a cent
You ain't know I get cash to pimp
Go ask him, my whores are fresh
Hardcore to death, 'xplore the rest
Tell you now backdoor's the best
For the stress
We never raw in flesh
Why I'm sores aguess (?)
I get paper, yeah I stack them chips
Condoms when I grab them hips
Kiss and mix you wrap them lips
And if she act (smack the bitch)
If she wack (smack the bitch)
Sad to see the way it had to be
Mack the bitch the bitch don't mack me
Cubic snappy but so are mine, know my rhymes
Yo, my rhymes got a concubine
Cause I control they mind
Avoid the crew
'void the groove
Got more doe, than the fued
Got more hoes, than the few
If I die they wouldn't know what to do
Whatcha think all they do is cry?
Tell you this between you and I
Forty slit wrists outta the forty nine suicide
Chorus x 1
And now I'm drunk of the Henny now, went off the Remi now
Niggas always envy now cause I'm good and plenty now
And when it come to gettin' head, yo many bow
Girls acting friendly now (Killa cum up in me OWW)
I leave em past leaking
Last weekend, I took Cardan to get his ass eaten
He said you past freakin but I'mma ace so throw your cards up
But if you stink baby, I ain't hard up
Hard luck to wash up, but that's insulting, revolting
But if you clean we ballin, eat you til you catch convulsions
And girls all fiend, for the bodm on my team and my mob
Think we scheme and we rob the way they screamin' for God
And all sluts wit the V's, let em see how it be
They be like ""No, you ain't puttin all that meat up in me""
You whylin out, for the styinout
Girls say I'm foul and doubt
But baby got to understand
That's what my style's bout

While y'all are born in and sworn in, In the store you fake bringing the corn in...
Meat, rice, and poultry

You can fault me

Tell him chill
He ain't the only one with chinky eyes
Yo, I relate to him
And I'll put eight through him
When I skate to him
And my co-d
I don't think you know whats taped to him
But think Oklahoma
I'll have this whole fuckin store with that smoke aroma
And yo, your wife keeps twitchin
Than we both can bone her

But we been livin here forever
Can you feel our beef
So give us half
Or I guarantee baby

And I'm a little bit high
Save a little and you die
Send a blizzard through your store
In the middle of July
So if you wanna chat
We can
If you wanna scrap
We can
But I feel like Jackie Chan
Exactly man
The Don grew
Murder thoughts like John Woo
I'm here for Bi
Not to calm you
Now it's a done deal yo

Yo, I would hate to have to bust her
That's petty black
Matter of fact I know yall
I know where that machete at
Give me that
Blamm!!!
That's when the chink had flipped
Then grabs me like Spock
On some Bruce Lee shit
And his wife had a grenade

In a week
I can bring about 10 thou to the store
Yeah, I know I know I know
That's not near to what your crew had
But we doin this together
Nigga that's too bad
Now here's the deal either take it or leave it
Cause see these guns
We can take it or squeeze it
And you know that Im that type
And my shorties.. they'll be here some time tonight
You know Ninya, the ninja wit China white?
They got some shit that will fuck around and blind your sight
They kind of tight
Now if I here things behind the hype

But since we learned to creep
Is like we yearn for sleep
And my girls in my face when i dont return tha beep
Its like a sin or a crime
U in tha benz all tha time
But ya man know u ain't wit ya friends all tha time
Ill be selfish
Sayin chancin tha long
Dats why I hang up when he answer tha phone
And Ill be callin from tha house in tha paul lobby
Plus I know him he too cheap for caller ID
And my girl in my face jus stressin me child
But Ill dial anotha number if she press redial

And you have me open tha way u throw yours
What tha hell you think why I bout those drawz
And when u go down how u move those jawz
Oh Lord

Damn u look good in ya blouse and ya skirts
But we got to be careful when we out doin dirt
This ain't about us its about who we hurt
But ?mom? i love ya technique
Tha way u make tha bed squeak
Ya man can't get it up
Maybe girl he deat meat
So lets creep
In a lex jeep
At a secret location do it again next week


Now that I sit here I lay distraught
Tha feelings get involved when u play tha sport
Cause when Im wit my girl u even stay in thought
And that dates back to my days in court
Sayin u admired tha way I faught
U ain't even listen when my airplay was short
Me for u girl yo I feel we deserve it
But u ever really think about is it worth it
When tha nights over and tha cris' is gone
You got kids and a man playin mr. mom
Your man and my wife will be gone in tha smoke
Cuz tha last time we did it tha condom broke

Who out here don't feel I'm lockin it yet
Video time, no props on the set
If you see a car that's my drop on the set
If you see jewels thats my rocks on my neck
And if a club scene really pop to be wet
We jus bought a chopper, you coppin baguettes
If you feel different, I'm stoppin the bet
You rockin a vet while we hop on a jet
Chorus
Hey pretty mama come wit me
If you think your a nasty girl
Your man had you livin in a fantasy
But it's really Cam'Ron's world
Meet me at the door about a quarter to four
And bring four more girls (bring em all)
My mans outside in the parking lot
With the six chromed out in pearl
And yo, you know my style when we creepin too
Yo, who dat boo, your man beepin you
Well say your wit Lexis, with the Lexus
God damn yo, I just missed the exit
I'm kinda tipsy, I don't want to wreck shit
And don't think ma, that I'm on some next shit
Just wanna know if we can get breakfast
Then go to the telly for some sex shit

They forgot about the fourth coast
It ain't nothing though
What up Arkansas, Minnesota, Kansas?
Kentucky, Missouri, everybody in the Lou'!

Thinking bout Guy Fisher
Never met him, but God damn, that's my nigga!
I figure real estate invested pie flipper
Never snitch, me, I'm in a bathrobe, fly slippers (I-80)
Left Chicago with good money for 5 drops
Westside, did the Southside like the White Sox (What up Stony Island?)
Van Buren, Pulaski, K-Town is contra (Westside)
They'll dearly depart ya, in front of MacArthur's (What up Madison?)
I'm the author for gangsters, tough guys
Did the whole Ohio, but I started off a Buckeye
Columbus to 'Nati; them towns I raped 'em
Few clowns was hatin', moved my pounds to Dayton
And in Akron, my niggas they would throw things
Not King James, these were coke kings
And you acting grown, doggy you ain't back at home
The smack, it's on, wrapped in chrome
You better get a chaperone

If you know like I know, you should lie low
Killa, I used to get it in Ohio
Don't forget the Chi though, guns are like a pyro
You keep playing, you will look like a gyro

Go 'head and hate me hater
Cause I'm flyer than a aviator?
Well, you'll get smacked with the radiator
And I get catered player. ""Wanna talk?"" ""Maybe later.""
Told her, her time was up, '88 her, Flavor-Flaved her
Need your neck choked; rather, your neck broke
You dead broke, yes folks, the jewels are like egg yolks
And you'll get yoked up, switchblade-poked up
Bitch-made since 6th grade, he need his rope cut
Cowboy roped up, ""y'all boys sold what?""
Know what? Dope, crack, and coke is in the coat tucked
Roll up, hold up, family, this a hold up!
Get close up, soaked up, I'm KG, post up
Ho, slut, no love, turn beef to cold cuts
Family getting bread, well he about to get his loaf cut
Y'all doped up, this game is sewed up
Malcolm X: tell the white bitch, ""Yo, I want my toes sucked""

If you know like I know, you should lie low
Killa, I used to get it in Ohio
Don't forget the Chi though, guns are like a pyro
You keep playing, you will look like a gyro

I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 6
My 12 and 12 -- well, they carry my bricks
And them 12-12 fiends, they're married to sniff
And the V12, that's on various trips
Y'all make a brother laugh, me I took another path
Come into my habitat, hovercrafts, bubble baths
Duffle bags stuffed with cash, fell in love with math
I got the green Benz, red Range, mustard Jag
White coke, tan dope, black gun, trey deuce
Silver bullets, purple piff, blue pills, Grey Goose
Pull out the rat-tat-tat
Duck duck, say goose
Beige coupe, suede roofs, send him up to Jesús (Jesus)
H-deuce, yea yea, piss off the state troops
See me, then they don't, I disappear, say, ""poof""

It's seven AM (yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I woke up late, didn't even have a shower
Lunch break? Give me a break, a damn half an hour
All this bullshit for twelve bucks an hour (I'm ready to quit)
Plug me to Chuck D, wanna Fight the Power
Instead I light the sour before I go in the office
Being here eight hours sure will get you nauseous

Brand new clothes? Naw you'd rather see me naked

Why am I working here? It ain't working here
It ain't worth it here, never gonna persevere
Ain't no money for new shoes or purses here
Should've done my first career (huh) nursing yeah
Now I'm sitting here thinking 'bout the work I put in
This verse from the everyday working woman

I put on my pants, put on my shoes
I pray to God, paid all my dues
I'm trying to win, seems like I was born to lose

Ayo I'm lookin' for a job, ain't nobody hiring
Then I ask the boss, ""when y'all doin' firing?""
You, I'm admiring, nice job, family man
Car and looking at these want ads, tiring
Shoulda been a fireman, learn to do wiring
Then get retirement, I blame my environment (it's my hood)
I went in for an interview, for delivery (for delivery)
""Locked up, felonies?"" now the dude's quizzing me
You working on my future, why you need to know my history?
All he did was Google me, no big mystery
He ain't digging me, politely he was dissin' me
""No we're not hiring, but thanks for the visit.""... ""Please.""
He ain't want me, my grandmother warned me
Them God damn felonies will haunt me, taunt me (I told you 'bout them felonies!)
No second chance, back to the same block
Go home, my baby moms done changed locks (fuck is she doing)
This a game ma? Okay the games on (okay)
Then she opened the door with the chain on (what's up)
Said she been reaching out, for several days
I ain't helping out, we need to go our separate ways (oh word?)
I was just amazed, wanna go another route?

Yo, I hit the bottom of her pussy yall
Nope I ain't talking bout her pussy walls
Yo, I hit the bottom of her pussy yall

Yo I be lying, denying that theres a pimp in me
But I apologize sorry you have my sympathy
When I hit that spot why you ain't tell me nothing
I swear to god yo, I thought it was your belly button
Nope, it was the bottom of your pussy hole
Her legs was shaking like she's trying to do the tootsie roll
We make the sweetest merger, should I keep or curve her
The sex agreed its murder, plus she's a squirter
Yeah baby girl drenched the bed
Sprinkler system, right on my expensive spread
But she made it up, gave me extensive head
Intensive, mention her man it don't make sense he's dead
Plus I like her cuz mami made me say mama mia
Plus she PYP, right Condoleezza
I george bushed her what she don't know what ima teach her
Im her teacher she's a libra, leave her nope ima keep her


Now I ain't seen her in two weeks, that's the wire
Now she sending threats saying that my ass a liar
When she see me she gon set my ass on fire
Came out the crib, got damn she slashed the tires
Keep it up ma, I'll call your mother
She said I already did, why don't you call my brother
And tell him what ""you hit the bottom of my pussy ho""
And you is a bitch nigga, faggot ass, pussy ho
I said your brother don't want to know how his sister is
And with that same mouth you go home and kiss your kids
But lets shift gears, its maybe you, its maybe me
Maybe, ""buts whats wrong baby?""
Baby said ""don't baby me.""
Oh don't baby you?
You acting shady boo?

Red stove, red pots, one in the head cocked
One the on the feds probe, red stools, red inf
Red floor, your all fakers red couch
Red crystal red pepper and salt shakers
The red room, red curtains, its summer squish
Show some respect what you expect thats a hundred inch
Telescopes binoculars the feds hate my vernacular
From sellin coke im proper docked that means im spectacular
They bitin like tyson, worse than that dracula
Ya moms buy heroin wit no hands im smackin her
Let me make it plain,
 
since Dana Dane I made it rain
Now in the strip club the Benjies turn to paper planes
I'm Killa, you Andre Miller, got a basic game
I told ya bitch to hurry up, we don't wait for trains
I'm Derek Jeter, cause I'm in between the base my mane
And thats on Lennox, 7 for 8th ace of kings
Silencers on calibers would do it louder bro
Sledge hammer, smash his melon im the black Gallagher
You know I dump mine on fake niggas, one time
Wack bitches
, rat snitches, 
my life's a punch line
I spend a grip in bars
, diamonds studded, vicious cars
Tha hoes, ask Joe, we audition ours
I hope you make the cut, pop ya puss, move ya butt
Ruger up, think we from Houston we done screwed her up

We pitchin', we pitchin', friction from mission to mission
Block to block, ave. to ave., from kitchen to Kitchen
We just cookin' baby, we just cookin up
We just cookin' up homie, we just cookin' up

You don' sold a bottle, huh, I'm twistin ya cap
And I'm luxury girl come sit on my lap
Her friends like don't go that shit is a trap
They'll have you traffickin' swallowin', shittin' smack
They pigeons in fact, how you gonna listen to that
You the fliest one in your crew
Them bitches is wack
Started to smile like you knew this shit was a wrap
Her friends was right tho, she gonna be pitchin some crack
I'm a true champ, you glance, 4 door, two tramps, fuck my money honey
Bring your food stamps, go ahead, you dance
A elephant to you ants
Chain, Alaska, Bracelet, Nebraska,
 crib, well disaster
42 plasmas, royal blue mauris, shorty you bastard
Only thing I don't know, what resort we in
I tell a bitch ""get over here"", like Scorpion
Cars, order in flavors, you order from avis
Come around me why? They know my aura contagious
And I'm sorta courageous, plus the kid smart
Forget Bizmark, he gonna catch more than them vapors
Next door at your neighbors, they said all of you haters
Set you up the very moment, I offered 'em paper
In the North I'm the Mayor
And my kicks, University of Florida
Of course they gators

Called her a ""stupid bitch"". Sorry? Nah, I might have meant it

But I got It back right back, yeah yeah my life is splendid
Me and mommy drinking, drinking to the point she hurls
I'm bout to swirl the whirl-whirl, want to join me girl?
The clothes: from Italy, the coat: from Sicily
I'm talking literally, (c'mon now stop kidding me)
I don't kid at all, I get it all, get rid of it all
Come and stay with me, oh, where I live? The mall
Banker banker, dealership, and the rim shop

Baby come and play and lay and
Stay with me, girlfriend I'll change your life
Spend the night with me, we'll talk and
Chill and watch TV she said (sure you're right)

You up in something fly, I got my weapon on
We get our chefin on, chefin on everyday
I got the cookie-cutter, mami the pepper spray


Lets get this guacamole, you feeling hot then hold me
You had your guard up at first like a soccer goalie
If I got it you get it, baby I get it you got it
Lets hit the Pacific, terrific, I'm feeling melodic
Cause you looking exotic, now you getting erotic
Like you straight from the tropics, want to shoot it and cock it
Not the Glamour, baby girl, I'm talking something else
All she do is look and say ""Cam, you something else""

Like a bad hand, no prob. folding 'em
Make 'em a golf course, 18 holes in 'em
Like a Jamaican shirt, 28 grams I could make it work
Straight to work, like amber stay alert
'fore I creep up behind you
Won't see me coming like the swine flu, huh... times two

My money came illegally, fuck it at least I'm honest
Finally 'bout to leave all the bullshit behind us
So right now death is the only thing I can promise
40's and the llamas
We hitting everything except the shorties in pajamas
Shooting in the Miami heat, like Chalmers
Slugs make you feel like you rocking leather bombers

Hut one, hut two, hut three, your family tossed
Calico, 81 to your chest: Randy Moss
""How much the candy cost?"" Then I'm explaining to folks:
""It's terrific, but be specific: the paint or the coke?""
I refrain from the hoax, lame, this game is a joke
But hit the hotline, got mine the Range to the Rover
I move the work from New York to New England
New Hampshire, New London, New Jersey, New Zealand
Hop out like ""Who dealin'? Who slingin'?""
Brick looking like ""Who wheelin'? Who blingin'?""
Then I handle weed and tell 'em how my parents eat
They got the work, it don't work? Your money back, guaranteed
But I guarantee money with your money you'll be after me
Fuck it up? Huh, a disaster B
Casualties actually, but I move casually
You're vulnerable, not a judge but call me your honorable
Go head and vomit fool, bomb the unbombable
We beef like a farmer do, my jewelry is a carnival
Heard the goddamn chain, it's like a ferris wheel
You fuckin' with Sosa, you won't find a better deal

Where you at? Who you with?
Get your gat, hit a lick
Flip a pack, flip a brick, man

Louis hat, Louis kicks
Toolie strapped in the mix

I sold the jums and the rock, filled the guns to the top
40th nigga, smoke a blunt with Barack
Put your heart in your stomach, your lungs in your socks
Your girl in my bed, your son on my block
Yeah, they stole my style trife, but this the jungle
Welcome to the wild life, ""Damn you got a foul wife""
I picked her up from karaoke and pilate class
She like to deepthroat, me I call it lollygag
Y'all niggas probably fags, not a body cast, a body bag
Fuck his toe, leave his whole body tagged
Primo give me bricks, I give papi cash
Burglars hit them licks, he'll let the shotty blast
At nine years old, ya'll was watchin' goof troops
Me the only fifth grader with the troop suit
20 years later, bitches boof it up in Gucc' shoes
For a month rent, a fly purse and some new boots
You out the loop lou, me I'm in the crew coupe
Truck boat, tough coke, same color as Dove soap
Niggas needin' favors, believe I'm major
Straight out the hood, but you should see my neighbors
You say a hundred dollars, he say a piece of paper
Yeah we own our cars, you still leasin', hater?

Where you at? Who you with?

I knew it would be inevitable, that my case should go federal
Its part of my journey, see it might concern me
But who Cam's best friend? My attorney!
Can you hold something, Can I throw you some
Now I know you dumb, Where I know you from
I ain't got it right now, but I owe you one
In your head, one shot from a loaded gun
Don't get extorted, I get escorted
To the resort, where the girls say, ""Lets snort it.""
I can import it, export it sports car
Lets port it, fresh auto, I report I just bought it
I scream lets get it, they ain't pimp my ride
My cars an exhibit, huh? next critic
I don't talk it I just live it, just prove it
Tell the feds Calm down, it's just music

Man you cold fronting, beat you like you stole something
Who you talking to, I asked you can you hold something
Where I know you from huh? Where I know you from
Where I know you from scrams? Where I know you from

You got a order shorty, you should learn ring
Your baby moms know, we call her sperm bank
Crazy ho, word baby bro
Mad generous giving out fellatio
A meat eater, Ms. Dahmer Dahmer
Honor my persona, its like a piranha's momma
We move bricks on the highway
So it's bricks in my drive way
K9 come, then the 9 spray
My girl's toe ring, that's 55K
Crack in 4B, coke in 5A
Dope in 8F, the ho's in 9J

We hustle all night, until the sky's gray
Why you think the whole hood corroded?
He tony the tiger, yeah he like it sugar coated


They got the cameras up; they want to tape a solider
Cuz I got that tan, you can call it beige & mocha
Talking in code, is sort of like playing poker
Bring the Pepsi in the oven, that's the baking soda
What up tiny bum, we were all the sorta
Feds gave em 25, damn a quarter mortar
But we from the same hood where they slaughtered porter
You a passer, me I got a scorers aura
Owe me money, your wife, son, daughter oughta
Leave the country, I'm thinking like Bora Bora
Run around with these silly secrets
Trying to keep it real, me I'm gon really keep it
You should really peep it, mack milly skeeted

Smack blood out her, nah she already bleeding
Now sitting in, with nothing on
So I jerked off, left her nutted on

That's why I fuck niggas, all I do is fuck niggas
If he can't eat the pussy I ain't sucking shit

Retire my jersey -- 65 for every chicken I plucked
Pass the purple stuff, whoadie, it's time to get swerk
Up on the block, 1,000 grams on Hogan and Kirk
We in them t-shirts and doo rags
Females all fall back when the No Limit boys in the house
Haters get back. Hot One hold it down
In foreign ghettoes. Big Boys, Uptown, Russian _
C-Murder locked up, but his name still ringin'
Big Simp getting yoked, ridin', hustlin' and slangin'
You know we bout it..I mean we rowdy!
New Orleans to the ATL: you know they bout it bout it
Saint Louis, they keep it swangin'
L.A. to Las Vegas, them homies out there gangbangin'
Oklahoma to Tennessee, them boys ain't playin'
Cause you know they B-O-U-T
Texas, Florida; Detroit, Georgia
Them boys dunn graduated from an 8th
Up on to water-water
Kansas bout it. Virginia rowdy!
Illinois boys to Mississippi: bout it bout it
New York, Arizona, the Bay Area, the whole California!
North Carolina, South Carolina: throw dem bows
Pennsylvania, Alabama: bout to let em know
Missouri rowdy. Boston bout it!

Cam'Ron

I heard niggas talkin' reckless
Man, y'all talkin' out the side of your mouth, nigga
Y'all niggas is faggots, straight pussy
Word to my mother, I'll put my foot in your ass, nigga
No homo, nigga, what's really good?
Jim Jones, Jim, Capo status, East side, fool
Dipset riders, nigga, when we catch you, we gon' slap that Kufi straight off your mothafuckin' head
Any other problems, nigga? You know Harlem gon' ride out, nigga
Harlem, y'all act like I wasn't gon' stand up
I wish you would, nigga
It's nothin'
When the dogs catch you, it's over, you're straight food, nigga
Everybody wanna be king of the city, right
When I come, nigga, y'all niggas better be real calm, nigga
It's nothin', we just livin', millionaire status shorty
When you fuckin' with the don, you fuckin' with the Jones, you heard, nigga?
Y'all with me? Harlem! Diplomats! Let's ride out
It's gangstas over here, Harlem hear me with you, Killa, east side

Aye yo, this lil’ nigga Nas think he live like me
Drove 5’s, shot 5, flipped pies like me?
Nah, Cam gonna blast, I done ran through his past
And I ran for the mag, Taliban on your ass!
You’re terry cloth, that means very soft
Thanks Jay, Carm’s the bomb, broke her cherry off!
Severely massacred, we really gonna laugh at ya
The MAC-Milli blast at ya, you really run to Africa
Stupid, sucker for love, home plenty
Nelson, Mandela, we all boned Winnie!
Shit, I come over and fight
You a lame, you forgot over the night
Yo, your career’s over like Mike
Any one, Tyson, Jordan, Jackson
Ask Dunn about my mean deals
Frizzle steam, triple beam, cripple teams
When you seen money in Queensbridge? Never
I used to catch the tunnel
Lil E, Vernon side, I gave him packs and bundles
How many grams in an ounce?
How many ounces in an eighth
How many eighths in a key
Shorty, stay in your place
Before the AK’s in your face
Take your daughter, R Kelly, have my way with her face!
And your mom’s a whip wop head
And you claim to be a hip-hop head?
Ooh wop, two shots in his hip-hop head
This way the whole world know that hip-hop’s dead! Killa!
Roc-A-Fella, hip-hop bread
50 thou' a night, holla back, hit my spread
You wack, you twisted, your girl's a ho
You’re broke, the kid ain’t yours and everybody know
Your mans even tell you, you be like, “So?
I love my baby mother, I never let her go”
Stupid…

That's right, nigga, we gon' get our spread, nigga
That's a dumb percent of that for me, nigga
So you know I'm ridin' for that, nigga
Country bum ass fuck, don't even know how to rock rocks
I caught you with them two rocks on your wrist, nigga
Next time it's gon' be killin', nigga
Trust me, man, I'ma clap you in flowers, you faggot
You ain't even relyin' on your own hood, nigga
You know where we at, nigga!
140th and Lenox, 15th and 7th, nigga
All our jewels, nigga, trust me, man, we glitterin'
Faggot, you punk, you fuckin' pussy hermaphrodite
Straight homo, pussy ass nigga with a dick, nigga
You got meek, nigga, word to
Man got me so mothafuckin' hot, nigga, I'm just gon' calm down, man
Yo Killa, fall back on these chumps and let's explain to them a few things they need to learn better, nigga

Long Time Coming,Diplomats Volume 5,2005,"It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come

Where my muscle, you be dazzing
But hustling's a hassle
Percocet, Demerol, capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you, they running with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those who incarcerated
Who had it confiscated?
Hate it when they take powder
I'm steady take showers
Baby mama on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man face to face through a glass
On the phone, 10 years he got chasing that cash
Cocaine, he had the game in a smash
Felt like the towers, when the planes went on crash
It wasn't 9-1-1, but it was 9 on 1
Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in, I had to find that dum
That's too long
[Hook: Sam Cooke & 
Cam'Ron
]
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
Dipset bitch, Dipset bitch
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
Oh yes it will

Nowadays, dawg, they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze 'em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost art
I'm like a ball player, shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche box
More props, RIP my poor pops
Can't see a son shine like the Four Tops
That's just what I sold dope for tops
For a second, 4 a rocks, for a burger, 4 a blocks
Shot out to the 4 building it's like Fort Knox
Bullets like freethrows though, sure shots
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers, you'll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers
Cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches
Nana to watch grandma
In pajamas, I snug out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa, you gon' watch Santana

It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come

Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate, little fence, I climbed over
Little scrapes, little dents, I got over
That was just the beginning it's not over
It's been a long time coming Cam
It's been a long time riding and a long time running man
Shit done changed since The Wop and the Running Man
Since Nino, G Money, the Carter and the Duh-Duh man
It's no longer a New Jack city
It's cop fast and move that quickly or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I ain't talking rap man, I'm coming off this road
I'm talking crack man and coming up with O's
I'm coming up with halves and I coming out with wholes
Shit got hectic, had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go, I received it, moved it and roll
I was coming from the QC, Zeek was coming from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smashin' dough
We was all on the paper run
Yeah, waiting for a change to come
Now look the change has come
7-Pick up, Yukon Range is come
The day has come, Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers in this game
We remain, it's a shame cause

It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come",https://genius.com/Camron-long-time-coming-lyrics
Hate Music,DJ Clue Presents: Backstage Mixtape (Music Inspired by the Film),2000,"HOOK: Cam'ron
Ayo my niggas can't take music
Everybody rap to us, so we hate music
Now we make the hate music
We 'bout to rape music, straight up degrate music
You ain't 18, shit, don't even play music
Killin is another high
I hope your girl get AIDS, your brother crash and dash
Or your mother die, and your sister is a topless dancer
No answer, glaucoma, and your pops got cancer

Yo I'm a motherfucking nightmare, y'all can either love me or hate me
Know alotta niggas wanna slug me and waste me
That's why I never keep the gun on safety
When I get this money, y'all gon hate me
Y'all act like Harlem ain't that shit, go 'head and play dumb
Like y'all don't know where AlPo and Rich bought the caine from
Sugarhill cocaine slums, get it correct
Real niggas spit at your chest, look at your death
Y'all cop Playstations, play Live 2000
I'ma cop guns, try to survive 2000
Nigga like me be on the block every day
While you think your moms look rocked every day
Cuz she come see me for them rocks every day
Keep the thang close, ready to pop every day
Cuz I'm tired of you spot betters
I got a 380 full of hot peppers, that'll rip through them cop's sweaters
You dudes is chumps, talkin 'bout you live like thugs
You be home watchin Midnight Love
No bitch, you and your hand makin midnight love
It's over dog, you need to just get right fuck, what
HOOK

I got the gun and clip, runnin shit
I run chains, run rings, run in your block, make you run
Then I run things
Piss in a cup, come on, fuck a drug test
I'm on my block, knockout kings, slugfest
A few beers cold, come through here bold
A few of us blew our goals when fuckin two years old
Off to the lobby, all to the body, then auction a shottie
Go to Boston and party hard with Walter McCardy
Drunk, smackin bitches off the Bacardi
Hustle often as robbery, so guns, coppin double
Fuck around with me, I'ma pop your bubble
Put up my own yellow tape, save the cops the trouble
If you wanna see my true portions, screw bossin
Kill you like Mike pop for new Jordans
Come through flossin, jail ain't nothin for me
I got cake baby, bail ain't nothin for me
I'm that same son of a B, gun in the V
Coke, guns, hookers, I'm the one that you see
Cats still talkin fly, put his tongue in a tree
If we nice, then we'll let him keep his lung for a G
When I rap, it ain't nothing but hungry you see

Dipshits,Federal Reserve,2014,"Never thought they'd see this again
Here we go!
Killa Cam in the building
Dipset!
You know what it is
My man A-Trak
I feel something epic, no homo

Man, I'm that nigga, y'all, I ain't even lying
I'm running fashion, man, I ain't even trying
I see these fuckboys hating on me
Been in the crib three years, they still waiting on me
But I'm done with the frontin', I'm popping trunk and pressing the button
No stunting, I'm dumping and pumping the pump
Somethin' to this chump, have him crying like onions
With a gun I am gifted, back up before I will happily lift it
Popping a cap in the back of your cap
Lift up your hat, my astro's malicious
Mommy backed up and said she see the difference
""You're mature, handsome, mixed with a lot of ignance""
Dick in her intestines 'bout to poke her chitlins
Call me 2 Chainz's Drummond, say my strokes are different
I'm different,
 you beating
What you doing after this, bitch? I'm leaving
Adios, vamonos
I fuck your mama, word to mama, keep your mama close

Uh, I know you miss this
It's still Dipset, you dipshits
Stay fly, don't get your bitch hit
Stay gripped, don't get your shit split
Uh, still push it and get it off
Nigga, we just cut from a different cloth
Uh, I know you miss this
Still Dipset, you dipshits

Man, fuck a magazine, don't care what you cowards read
Don't gotta wonder, we like wonder with our bread
Money, respect, don't forget the power, dread
Had this one girl squirting like a showerhead
Nine on the waist, eighty keys in the trunk
Stamp on the dope, eighty degrees of funk
Reebok money, eighty degrees in the pumps
Lookin' for me? Top floor suite of the Trump, baby
Cause of stupidity, send fire, humidity
No one here is sick of me,
 got the gift, no Christmas tree
Get the shovels, y'all, everyone digging me
I'm back to the future, still making history


I feel like rapping on this shit
First off, my name is Dame Dash
And I want to talk for a second if you don't mind, let me just say one thing:
I am from Harlem, and I'm back outside
And you know what that means?
That means people eat. Cause I'm a Harlem nigga, and that's what we do
That means when we walk in the room, nobody's safe
You 'bout to feel that, pause
Harlem sticks together
So if you feeling like number one, get ready to be number two, cause we back
What's that shit y'all be saying?
Fool's Gold!
Aight? 'Bout to party, I might pop bottles
Might have to see Champagne Dame!",https://genius.com/Camron-dipshits-lyrics
Humphrey,Federal Reserve,2014,"Always tryna doubt a nigga 'round here
I ain't ever really lost nothin'
HARLEM!

Dame said I'm buggin' cause I wanna fight B-Hop
I said I'll fuck him up after two months of detox
 (true)
True, besides that, 8 mil' from Reebok
I take him to the bar, Pa, that’s 33 shots
He tellin' me I need not (what?)
He must not remember young Killa that hustled in his weed spot
When he had the black Lex and I boost tree tops
Somebody talk about him then they woulda got a speed knot
This is when me and Hud sorta ran the G spot
Older niggas left and we came in with green tops
Listen here, so you got my vision clear
Never for pro but I made niggas disappear (poof!)
Niggas know not to fuck with me (word!)
And my record is sucka free
This money, I've been makin' it work
So A-Trak,
 
let's take 'em to church
They don't hear me though!

Na'm sayin'?
I ain't fight my way to the top of the food chain to be a vegetarian
I'll get my own
Bank is a place still lend you money
If you prove you gon' need it, nahmean?

My parents got high, no lie, it's no shame
A product of dust, lust, and cocaine
Still cool with some niggas though, that sniff 'caine
That grow weed to grow hair like Rogaine
Heartless to the core, feel no pain
That's models, hood rats, old flames
Bitch niggas, haters, famous, no names
Street fighter.. I throw flames
On the strip, no strippers
But she suckin' the tip, I might tip her
Understood in my hood, that's the way we go
You can't comprehend or understand the ratio
From a baby, yo, pop got no money for milk
The .380 blow, up-up-away we go
No cash to help out your lady, yo
And look out for baby bro
Should I rob a bank? Tell me somethin', yes, go, maybe, no
What I do next? Get crackhead fellatio
They thought I was slow like Radio
A couple years later, though, they heard me on the radio
Whoa, bro, yo, Killa (..Killa)

Before I met Terrence Howard, Cam hustled and flowed
Be in meetings in my pajamas
Turn decimals into commas
You get it like I get it then meet me in the Bahamas
Island, in Nassau I'm building a Benihanas
Still in the hood, though waiting on any drama
Or the projects parked waiting on your mama
Or the park in the projects to bating with piranhas

But guess what she asked me, yo
Word?

She said Jay made you a millionaire and looked me in the eyes
Said cake, cake, cake got that from the pies
We made each other millions, that was my reply
But had a mill before I met him, baby, that ain't no lie
See he named some Harlem cats and the homie from the Chi
But my thing, he ain't name nobody from the Stuy
And I do it like Bed-Stuy, do or die
But lets talk about something else, you and I
She said cool, played the cool from far
My friends wanna ride if you cool with it, pa
It's all good we played pool at the bar
But I usually don't carpool, there's pools in the car, muah
She impressed by the lemon coupe
Life threw me lemon, I made lemon juice
Huh, from that I made lemonade
I kept the workers, sergeants and lieutenants paid
You messing with a nigga with mob ties
Plug me in girl, download my hard drive
In the bedroom might get hog tied
Dog fucked, aw shucks, welcome to our lives

This what I told her though...

Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you

Yo, she was intrigued by my repertoire
Heard I had niggas on water like the reservoir
Packs of crack, 9 mill in my dresser drawer
Heard I sold keys but made more off metaphors
Told her, her homework's efficient
Don't forget girl I get a lil' ig'nant (true)
And I Diddy bop like I tore a ligament
My whole persona, understand that you diggin' it
I know my life seems exquisite (true)
Know where I'm from, girl, you wanna take a visit?
We can spin up off my pivot, I don't talk it cause I live it
And the money in my pocket 'nough to stack up to a midget, girl...

At twelve, I had a knife for your windpipe
At thirteen, at the stash-house I spent nights
Could be wrong, but since fifteen, I've been right
At seventeen, I ain't care what my friends like
Nineteen was mean, I mean I had Hundred Ten Nike
Airs; twenty one became my money year
Twenty three, I could have been facing two hundred twenty years
Yeah, so let's celebrate, elevate
Roll the vanilla, fella; victory, hella cake
Man, y'all sweeter than Cream Savers, my team's major

Boy, they'll stink, nigga
It's a few of us left
We'll leave you stink, nigga
Stink nigga, wash up -- you funky fresh
Dirty jeans, wack kicks
No cake, with monkey breath
No kicks, but a face dirty stress
A hundred K, twenty steps
Like the way honey dress
One year, one arrest
Tough charge, never met
Homicide, another death, another mother's son at rest
Mother made a motherfucker for my ranger breath
You get it to do it; man, you ain't done nothing yet
I could become a threat; calico, a hundred wet
Wanna bet? When I make it rain, your whole sun'll set
Doing a show? No prob, I'll book it for him
He ain't want the work, so I took it for him
Ribs, I cook it for him; I'll make you rich and famous
Ask Vato, Robin Leach, he lived for him


I'm from where the strong prey upon the weak
Where the lions teach their babies bite before they grow they teeth
They say the world dog-eat-dog, huh?
Well, where I'm from, we all eat dog, bruh
Come from the jungle, learn how to hustle from hunger
Keep my money in bundles, keep a gun that's humungous
Predators are among us, oldest down to the youngest
We hunting, hope to be stunting, turning nothing into something
Get hundreds from going out of bounds, jackals throw a lot around
Trappers get the pounds and run 'em in and out of town
I'm from the A where quarter, halves, whole things you get

Car spray-painted, fucked up, real rap
She did surgery to the V, open heart
Gotta be careful with it, (what's that?) a girl's broken heart
She pulled up with her friends like: ""what's shaking, nigga?""
Them hoes hopped out like Halloween and egged a nigga
You know that made me mad, popped the trunk, K I grabbed
Aimed at where her make-up bag, then thought about it
Wait a minute, this is same bitch that snitched up on her baby dad
He missed his son’s youth, that shit is uncouth
Catch 22, love, hate, thin line
This fatal attraction obsess, thin line
Duck-duck, goose-goose, I keep the duce-duce
I watched Snapped on Sundays, these bitches screws loose

2 Chainz!
Check the Audemar, put the car in park
Clovers, diamonds, Ace of Spades, party hard
We started off friends, then played bros and sisters
But I guess it’s incest cause now I'm fucking with you
Close nigga, so cold you get frosbit
Fucked your friend, fucked up your love
Now you are lovesick
Gimme that kitty-kat, I play Garfield
Flyer than Hartsfield, summersaults, cartwheels
Flipped out like a lingerie
Took her to the psychiatrist, 'Baby, you belong here!'

She ain't drink liquor, but I gave her a cocktail
Gave me great knowledge, call it top Yale
You gonna make me come? She replied, ""I will not fail!""

On the dance floor smack, watch me grab a bra
But I still get fly, only without a jar
When the sun hit the jewels, turn to avatar!
Yeah, but in my pocket a ghost notes
No foes, dad will bring you there on a road boat
No joke, blow smoke, thought I had no hope
Then I copped the yacht guess I showed boats!
Yeah, guess I showboat
Catch me on a water baby, that's how hope floats

Crazy is what a her speech got... start to preach
Ease up, advice I need not!
Blow weed in a weave top, she shock
She look good, but that ain't why she hot
What you're smoking, please stop!
Please bitch, I'm cool with Dre.. but I ain't trying to detox
Cheap skates yeah they throwing cheap shots
We the clean up crew true... who floors need mop
You know how true it is, flyer than stewardess
Don't have to say who it is!

The girl all on my zipper
In the club, baby more than the tipper
Oh, better yet man more than the strippers
As a matter of fact man more than the liquor!

Hey, nigga you know this
Hey, and you know this
Hey, and you know this

Go Outside,Ghetto Heaven Vol. 1,2013,"I really wanna go out, I really wanna go outside and stop to see your day x2

Uh, it's fucked up outside man. Shit crazy man. Barack gotta hurry up and do something man - they just reelected the nigga right? - word!

Man, my car fucked up, accelerator choked
I ain't got time, to tell you haters jokes
On my stoop they try and sell a player coke
Now I walk inside my lobby and the elevator broke? Damn
Niggas act hard, when they in the midst of folks
A hard drop baby, when they get eviction notes
They gon have to drag me out, fuck it bring 'em in to fight
Matter fact by ten tonight I'll organize a tenant's strike!
With our T-shirts saying ""WE THE PEOPLE"" (Us!)
Then I point at you, meet the evil (them!)
You can't neglect the feel, go back upstairs and expect to chill
But forgot to pay the electric bill
Shit, what the hell?
Saturday night, no SNL
Tomorrow Sunday, no NFL
I go on Twitter, type FML


Far as a job, it's hard to find a steady one
Just got paid and feel like I owe everyone (damn)
Troy, Tanya, Mike, Annette, Rex
My nigga Rex, he gon have to wait 'til next check
Just got laid off, damn, what's my next step?
Cop the work from the Hill, that's my best bet
A text from Tasha, looked at it awkwardly
Said she left the doctor and she really need to talk to me
Went on for hours, she text ""you ignoring me?""
Text her cordially, ""yeah you move unlawfully""
Threw the phone away, grabbed me a Boost Mobile
Fuck that iPhone shit, all my moves local!
My pride defined, never lie, you could ride on it
'Bout to go to the Ave, who got 5 on it?
Split the bill with Harold, Page, and Darryl
Then I went and played spades with Ms. Carrol",https://genius.com/Camron-go-outside-lyrics

Five in ya dry curls
Girl what you talking about? Yo who you talking to?
Welcome to my world
Where you might get your shit laced
Girls got their wigs laced
Spit on cop cars, rip up parking tickets

Girls fight at the nail salon
Baby mom and wifey, well see they don't get along

And I'm like Santa, yea I got something for all y'all

That ain't no baby powder (Go ahead and just taste it)
What you're thinking it may be flour

Yeah she got some lady power
I nutted on her face, baby that's just a baby shower
Been doing this before Bathing Apes
Moving out state to state
Man I been on this paper chase
Niggas just hate to hate, but they know I be making pape
Don't matter the season
But I been about shake n' bake (no homo)
Man I told all you hoes before

That coke I got off the boat
That I made float, then copped that Beamer
Over her I cock the Nina
Load the 9 or swerve the Tommy, and yes, I love her
Got my mother out the gutter, word to mommy
Where your real friends at?
Poverty, put an end to that
You ain’t got it, they don’t come around
Only come around for your income tax, but...
Shout your homeboy or your homegirl
That know your game
That let you hold they car
Claim the kids, put your phone in they name
True, they're along for the ride with ya
Even when you’re dead wrong
Right by your side with ya
In the club, bump, ya'll pose for the right pictures
Somebody act, they're down to fight with ya
I held his kicks, he let me hug his chicks
Oh, pardon me y'all I’m just talkin 'bout Huddy 6

Wet T-shirt, no water gun

Grandma raised me, Lennox Ave took it over, though
Thanks to Zekey, he kept my pockets on overflow
Un gave me my first deal, Benz gave me my first wheels
But thanks to Hector Garcia Sr. – gave me my first meal (gracias, papi)
Wanna thank God, my Lord and savior looking over me (looking over me)
Thanks to Tanya, for years I tore up her ovaries (what up, girl?)
Thanks east, west, north, south, overseas (Peru)

Everybody runnin' around, do what they want do
Til two in they ass, no homo

Uhh, no degree, but I got knowledge of self
I, polish my style, lace my wallets with wealth
Now I acknowledge my health
In the mirror I just smile at myself (damn!)
You think you fly? Feel like a pilot myself
Violence - I move in silence, I announce it as stealth
Four pound to the bouncer, try pronouncin' my belt
Pounds - half a pound, kilos, ounces I dealt
Heat, you clowns would just melt
Beat niggas down, give 'em welts
The streets is fucked up, government givin' no help
They get high off the water, niggas livin' like Phelps
My block, had millimeters, hollow points was the finest
A better word to define us, the 140th niners (word)
Why? Nine 9's, 9 to 9
We ain't care if you was deaf, dumb, stupid or blind
Stoop to stoop with them dimes
Recruit the youth losin' they mind
Build a bomb, put 'em on
Yeah, coupe to coupe when we shine, shine

Nah mean?
Ain't no chorus on this man
Just roll one up and think about it man
I don't sell wolf tickets
I don't tell you no lies, I don't sell dreams man
Think about it
Don't sell yourself short neither
If you're easy to get you're easy to for-get
Remember that

Man listen, you'll be John Doe, I run with some no namers
Never met celebrity
Don't even wanna know famous (they ain't with it)
I call 'em my disclaimers that tote stainless
5th bangers from La Havana, no inglés (español)
What you want baby? E, Molly, or nose English?
She said ""number 3"", oh, you feelin' cocaineish
Turn fiend, b-ball rapper or a dope singer
In an alley self abortin' with a coat hanger
To this environment, understand that I'm no stranger
Mo' money, mo' homicide, mo' danger
The love is fake, the hate is real, and yo' anger
Gon' leave him with broke fingers, believe me, he's no gangsta
I come from poverty, for that coke, ma was starvin' me
Curvin' me for that Ramen need fronto leaf for this harmony
Long nights, long johns while armed for the robbery
A life of crime, this life of mine I swear I need a warranty

Still riding coach, need a Coach bag
Let me coach you, no Coach tags (what does that mean?)
Get rid of that Coach bag!
And listen, I ain't trying to throw jabs
(Fuck you, Cam,) Why you gettin so mad?!
Only one that deal with Cam is a queen
Louis handbags, Alexander McQueen
Yeah, stand up I'm mean
For how I handle my team, clean
Harlem niggas don't wear sandals with jeans
Car, scale, gun: I can handle the Beam
Nickel, dime, twenties...I can handle the fiends
So...hey Muma, que pasa?
I'm water, baby: agua

Hey yo, muma!
I'm saying
Can I come over? Cause
I'm not playing
Bend your ass over, uh, I'm not waiting
And if I'm sober, I'm blazing. Hey!

Hold up, (*spit sound* khat tou) let the Slime spit
Need these first three rows, let my slime's sit
Icy, make it hard to see the time tick
Me and my dime chicks, with glasses of wine, lit
Your money can't provide this
""Hi miss"" the answer's ""yes, your Highness""
""Try this! Only I can supply this""
Reply this, you'll only see me in fly shit, shit

Trying to play a tough role? I'm like ""not you""

Under the sun is where we pose
We hot, duke
Whoo, is what I did to the booth
How I spend in the coupe
While UN members salute
I'mma keep it trill: I'm the nigga living the proof
Telling me to chill is like stoppin' Kemba to shoot


In the hood where I creep trying to hook me a freak
Want to see what girl around here could put me to sleep
Could mean a hotel, could mean a suite
Could mean tuition, could mean a Jeep!
Damn those bougie-ass women night Cam hoes
When we jump out of Lambos
Car, neck, hand froze
Damn, yo! Cameras, stand, pose
Therefore, watch her ‘fore Cam goes

She go down, I’m tryna get the top
Me, Lee, ? and chop
How to hit the block: e, weed, piff, and rock
Before the DT’s get the watch
The neighbors watch, all day switching spots

Extra jig, 20 L's
No movie but I bought out that 2012
""Hey girl"" she ignored me, I'm like ""Honey, hell""
What up money? I'm Cam, but I know money well
Sniff me, that money smell, cologne juke
Chrome coupe, before towns Killa had his own stoops
Now I'm shaving coke on an amazing boat
Fuck you, suck dick
I don't know what to say to folks..
Sick chain, from the 6 train
Took the 5th lane, where I get brain
Yeah, get brain, shit mane
I blow past em
Can't hear y'all niggas
Closed caption
Been places, spent faces
Y'all big babies, Glen Davis
You ain't that one team
So come dream, Bruce Leroy glow
Y'all need sunscreen

American greed shit'll turn you
Into the worst type
Lock like Madoff, die like Kirk Wright
You'll get more dirty when
Your collar and shirt white
Carry our dreams, Rose wishes
The thirst life
I'm fire, you burn
Backstreet Boy *NSYNC like Lou Perlman
I'm the 6th member as long as the crew earn
Half the crew earnings, I take my break

Sosa wars I'm feeling like Big, Harlem we back son
On stage, boxers and Timbs
Holding my plaque up
Beat knocking, red put that track up
Move 8-balls, play pool? Well nigga rack up
Hit the white with all soda
Terrorizing the streets in the Viper or Cobra
New Louboutin sneaks with spikes all over
Crib on some kid shit, my Nikes all over
Small purchase, next time I'll re-bigger
Fitted low dark shades like I don't see niggas
Getting dough like I don't need niggas
Didn't know that crime pays?
Well look at Flea nigga!
Fortune 500, we read niggas
Wall Street Journals and several
American Greed niggas
Lot of dough to be made, shit
I agree, nigga
Summertime, True Religion jeans
Is capris nigga


Julius Earving whip her: I'm a 6er
Rucker Park mixer, with the rock I fix ya
Ball at Bar Mitzvahs, miss is off the Richter
Ricky Ricardo laugh at ya
Get your chicks up
Chips up, I got a full house
Ferrari pulls out, leave chicks
With a full mouth. Ouch
Cage open: who let the bull out?
I'm good out, violence and drugs
I'm what the hood about

Vado got a vision that's so raw
Say no more. Rewind: he remind me of me in '04
Maybe it's our habitat, maddest clap
Rat-tat-tat, I had to trap, imagine that
Lenox Ave graduate in fact
And if you seen me in the Louis

Stab ya aunt, hit ya sis, duct tape ya brother

They put my name in the black book cuz they petro
Black retro's, yeah them 60 plus
And black expo, necks broke just to look at us
Ridiculous delivery, the boss type
She fell in love with my kick game like Posh Spice
Half the shit, you spit plain, you part nice
Half the brick is cooked cain, that's hard white
Automar bright, all the haters respect it
Feel like the governor in the Schwarzenegger collection

No OutKast, love me low in the Big Boi
Border her ass, throw some D's on it like Rich Boy

Looking like a bowl of sugar, so sweet
Thinking bout what you look like, no teeth

Known for breaking down small things to a client
4 pound, a small things in the iron
Fucked what could have been a small thing but you lyin'

Second, you stole Kanye from Dame
Third, you stole Rocawear from Dame
Fourth, I seen the nigga throw that diamond up before them shots was fired
Fifth, hold on, turn the beat off
I had to turn the beat off for this

You was born in 1968

Open toe sandals with chancletas with jeans on
How's the king of New York rockin' sandals with jeans and he 42 years old?
Back to business

You ain't the only one with big wallets
Got it, my shits brollic, dot it
But your publishing should go to Ms. Wallace
Honest, stealing Big's shit, he made two albums, you wilding
And he can't dress, dawg, who styled him?
It was Rocawear when Dame had it
Now you got it, call it Cockawear, heh not in here
Dead it pronto, you won't see a car, no
Dame and Biggs' bitch for years, now you Juan ho
He own the 40/40, got you in Atlantic City
Pitch your budget outta Baseline, goddamn it's pretty
You love a Harlem nigga, we get it cooking it's true
But now I look, we got more dudes in Brooklyn than you
Apparently, right? Down in Jeezy video
I should've kissed you on the cheek, you a pretty ho
And Jaz video you starred in it: Peter Pan
I was hopping off the Greyhound: Peter Pan
How could he be the man? Ha, only reason fam
I don't suck dick or kiss ass and I'm conceited, damn
But we hawk yo, right where you walk bro
You can fool the rest of the world long as New York know
We put you under ground clown, they gon' check the cellars

Just for telling y'all, I get fined a hundred thou'
Huh them cats are ill, five times a half a mil'

Paul Wall cap a grill but them cats are daffodils
East Coast, West Coast, slang yo cap get peeled
Down in Houston, ask B I'm a mack for real
Hackie tell me, respect, better dwell me
Beyoncé fiancé,

I might bring it back, that's your girl, that's your world
Had the thing, fucking singing 'bout slinging crack
Mr. Roc-A-Fella stop, stop, stop it fella
Still got our acapellas, but I will Akinyele-ya
(Put it in ya mouth, uh, put it in ya mouth)
It ain't my fault I'm raw, I'm sorry B but I want a war
And he stabbed Un over Charli Baltimore
Sucker for love, hmm-hmm sucker for love
Kill a bitch, go to trial, hand be stuffed in the glove
I'ma hop in the bed, dawg gon' just pop off her head
Tell ol' Jay-Z chill, 
Cochran is dead

You got anthrax over there man, and we George Bush man

Acting like you got something over there

Let it out man, get ready for 15 rounds man
And all I did was battle once
Everybody getting ready to step to the plate
And I'ma step up again and slam, grand-slam yo ass pardon me

Chipped in for the GS, you Jaz-O's son

Round one, let the games begin doggie
Hahaha, ain't laughing at ya ugly ass no more

Had a little knife, tried to flick his shine
Had a big gat, click clack, hit recline
Don't ever complain, over no dumb dame
See you big money, I'll turn 'em to chump change

But a nigga wanna know
Babygirl, you gon' suck it or not?

Huh?
My dick hard as a motherfucker
You don't what?! Tell that shit to another sucker (what I look like?)
I ain't no sucka, mama, come on fuck the drama (fuck that)
Pet, kiss it, then, lil pucker-rama (lil pucker-rama)
I'm so active, you being so drastic
Got something for ya face, fuck pro-activ
I'm a pro at this
Round the globe, atlas
But I need to know ma, you gon' suck it or not?
Babygirl, I'm in love with the twat
Missionary, back shots, pop it off, rock it off
I tell you right now if my cock is soft (what I want?)
Head before and after (what's that?)
Top it off (do what?)
On ya knees, show you how to top a boss (how it go?)
Lick, suck, deep throat, stop, cough
Hop on, hop off, lollipop off
I know it's white, but here come the hot sauce


Lookin light skinned, mami was type slim
Fat ass, big tits, I noticed her nice chin (sturdy chin)
I approached her, slight grin, white Timbs, number you can type in
Said she don't like men (hahaha)
I just laughed, ma, if we link, we link
You don't like men? me neither, what a coincidink (what a coincidence)
Ms. Jiggy, Ms. Piggy, Pinky mink, pinky ring blingin'
Ma, you gon' suck it or not?
I ain't the type to diss you, kinda like the issue (I like that)
That's the situation, bring wifey with you (bring her)
Would you like a tissue? (Why?)
You gon' need it for the cum in your nose, babygirl, cause you suckin my cock!
Ain't a question now, it's a guarantee
They say I think I'm the shit, (oh well) well apparently
But you won't hear words like ""Marry me"" (what, marry me?)
Only thing you gonna hear is, ""suck it or not!""


I get head in the strangest places
Two at the same time, call it changin faces
I tell a bitch ""we ain't tradin places""
Now stand back and catch my amazing graces (Heheh)
Taste and savor it
Vanilla Ice Cream, she say ""ooh, my favorite""
Do you know who you playin' wit?

Chillin' like a scarecrow, looking for some brain
Drivin' in the range or
Flying on a plane

She know the game, get in and get right
Every bitch in the industry wanna rock my mic
I'm hot like light
I'm tough like Ike
I don't fuck with dog hoes cause them hoes might bite

Love My Life,Killa Season,2006,"Ayo, I never claim to be hard, tough, 
no homo
Gangsta, none of the above
Just a kid from 140th and Lenox Ave, Harlem USA
Trying to make his way in the world, ya heard?
You know through the trials and tribulations that life brings
I lost some friends, incarcerated, some are gone forever
You know you can't expect everything from everybody
So get up, get out and get something
That's what I did

Before I had the hammer cocked or Santana rocked
Little Jerv
, 
Grandpa Terry
, 
Grandma Dot
Uncle Carl
, Uncle Ted, Uncle Steve, Uncle Bill
Cousin Steve, Cousin Bill up on the hill, now
My Aunt Normy, 
I don't speak to my Aunt Dida
Or my Cousin Bathsheba
; 
love my mother, Frederica
Neighbor Freda, daughter Raven and Nicka
Down another doorbell was that nigga Wardnell
He gave birth to 
the best MC you never heard
Leather after leather and was clever with whatever words
Derek Armstead, Bloodshed from C.O.C
He did damage
, 
road managed by G-O-D
A.k.a. DukeDaGod, he was stupid hard
Sixteen, a bitch dream, had stupid cars
Cutlass 68', hooptie 75'
Still drive some bullshit, I don't know why
I love the nigga though, for him put Cris' in the air
First one dis 'em in here, I swear I'll risk my career
That's a fact, dick, ain't talking no rap shit
I'm talking that MAC clip, niggas will back-flip
Act sick
, 
my dude studied the Sabbath
No beef, veggie nigga, maybe some catfish
He could have my house, 
he could keep my Mauris
He could drive my cars, 
this a Eastside Story

That's why my dudes love me, I let them do them
You either gon' be rich or famous fucking with me...probably both
If you happen to brush shoulders with me by accident, play Lotto
9 out of 10 times you gon' win, nigga

Play the game, sure to win
They all up on me, know they wants my ends
I sacrifice, 
I roll the dice
I love my hood, I love my life

See, a boss I'm prepared to be
When I walk away from a confrontation
I ain't scared of you, I'm scared of me
I got a gun - you don't, so it's flares you'll see
After that, a five-thousand volt chair for me
So I move carefully; niggas don't care for me
Who care? I don't; you share, I won't
Calm down, breathe again
I don't do extortion unless I'm on the receiving end
Talk to my money, first time I heard her speak
That's word to me, told me I deserved to eat
Moved to a killer Ave, right from a murder street
Rocked Adidas Forums, even though they hurt my feet (that's fucked up)
I don't look in the sky, never mind stars
Know some fine stars right behind bars
Snags, Black, Doe on house arrest
Zeek
, Sheek, won't even throw out the rest
They wanted my ass, right along side Zeek
Turn myself in? Nope, play hide and go seek
I'm gone
, 
put the clip in the chrome
Yeah, I'm just like a fly, see the shit that I'm on?
And hour after hour, I would chill at the after hours
Where they flash the powder, no bath or shower
In that same spot, realized math is power
So I point at the mansion that is ours

Play the game, sure to win
They all up on me, know they wants my ends
I sacrifice, 
I roll the dice
I love my hood, I love my life",https://genius.com/Camron-love-my-life-lyrics
Killa Season (Intro),Killa Season,2006,"Before we get into this Killa Season
Let's start this shit off with my man 40 Cal

Who am I? 40 Cal. motherfucker
Gat to your back, get down motherfucker
Clown motherfucker
(You will be wonderin' what are we gonna do now)
Let me try to explain
I shoot his truck up just to drive him insane
Give his Rover the new name, the firin' range
When we see you yell fire and aim
'Cause when I fire them thangs it's like
(You will be wonderin' what are we gonna do now)
I gotta watch who with me, watch too pretty
Drop two-fitty on a hot new Bentley
But when it come to drops say he cop too many like, damn
(You will be wonderin' what are we gonna do now)
That whip wonderful Cal {they make Hummers in brown?}
Nah I just shitted on you, even haters lovin' my style
I'm a role model, I make the hustlers proud
I make the customers smile
(You will be wonderin' what are we gonna do now)
Catch me in them thangs with Jennifer, BM's with Olivia
If it ain't Vivica it's somebody sim-i-lar
Comin' down the block the suspense is killin' ya like, wow
(You will be wonderin' what are we gonna do now)
That's Cal. we see him (we see him), we leavin' (we leavin')
He schemin', he be beastin'
Heard he kill people, we believe him
Oh shit, he's reachin'
(You will be wonderin' what are we gonna do now)


Killa... Killa!
Dial Killa for murder once, no redial
Just see child, the OG style and how I used to be wild
This the story of Cameron Ezike Giles, one way road to the penal
Yea the hoosegow, ohh child you wasn't there
Zeek snitched? If he did, I'd be doin' a hundred years
Did the interstate, big cities, tiny ones
Took over niggas towns, black tie, tiny bums
Handsome hoods, pretty thugs, but we grimy dun
Cars, cribs, money, had to find me some
Zeek right behind me dun dun, he play by all the rules
That's why the house is his, the cars, all the jewels
Y'all niggas all are fools, your regular married with children
Dog, nine to five, office pool
Couldn't live that life, I need a loft and pool
I had too much class, I ain't report to school
If they report to school, I caught the stool, extort the fool
Took off his jewels, thought he cool
Gun to mouth, they often drool
Fuckin' with this wolf, this should be taught to you
Your money don't matter, what you can't afford to do
Is fuck with me dawg, that could be affordable
Hide ya mom, police protection, that's when I'm cordial
Cars convertible, TVs are portable
Fiends on line, coke lines, they come and snort a few
Killa!

(Killa!)
Guns, cars, bitches, and (Killa!)
Weed, smoke, dope (Killa!)
Glocks, ox ockin' I'm cocked (Killa!)
Cam, fam, damn, it's (Killa!)
Season and the reason you breathin' (Killa!)
Who buy out the bar though? (Killa!)
Who far from a star but they car is Gallardo? (Killa!)

I was forced to eat, anything you lost I keep
Shot the fifth, and then like a Piston, toss the Heat (Bye)
Now round the corner, up the block, cross the street
Up fifty flights, iight where the bosses meet
And the Porsche is peach, felt like Boston George
Left Boston Market, did deals on Boston Beach
Now I bought the beach, all because they applaud my speech
One nigga crossed the chief, I know you heard he lost his teeth
And it's Killa!

Guns, cars, bitches, and (Killa!)
Weed, smoke, dope (Killa!)

I.B.S,Killa Season,2006,"Let me tell y'all a lil' story about myself
This right here is a true story, check it out though, uhh...

Ulcers hurt my salary, alter my personality
Give it to you real, I can't feed my culture no fallacy
You know my attitude: arrogant, cocky, rude
Eating off papi food, used to be a stocky dude
Weighed two-twenty, with two honeys, I move money
It's true dummy, dunny need a new tummy
I become berserk, it was no fun to work
Every day my stomach hurt, ripping off my undershirt
The pain was no comparison, stomach started cherishing
Throwing up in public, yo fuck it, it was embarrassing
Regurgitating: green, yellow, burgundy, boom
But came my urgency soon, (what) the emergency room (oh)
In there, no salvage, treated like a cold savage
They said pimping symptoms, huh, a dope addict
There you have it, but they ain't find no heroin
Coke, crack, dope, just weed, but that's my medicine

My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again

Never mind stunting, dime puffin, doc spent his time fronting
He like a bad detective, he ain't find nothing
Besides that though, I can't enjoy a movie dinner (why is that?)
My son growing up, I'm looking like the movie Thinner
I'm thinking suicide, do or die, sit and cry (oh)
What hurt my baby moms asking if I'm getting high
She gonna play me a thug, I told the lady I love
If it ain't hustling ma, please don't relate me to drugs (at all)
I'm losing weight though, every day pounds of muscle
Gotta get off my ass, hit some towns and hustle
Bein sick, huh, it get sickening you know
I was too sick to do shows, but still equipped to move O's
You know my attitude, get it how I get it
If I can shoot, I turn around (then) I'm off my pivot
And oops, I thought I had it mapped
Weight started to gain again, it was just a game my friend
Dame mane I pained again

My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again

Killa!
Ayo, god body, I'm hard bodied, word mommy, vanishing
Had to go low, The Mayo Clinic, Minnesota
I couldn't get cake, a rock in a hard place
For me, that's a odd place, I'm only here by God's grace
Like a lab rat, them tests dishonor Cam
Ultrasound, MIR, CAT scan, sonogram
Laparoscopy, endoscopy, I be stressed (I be stressed)
The prognosis, diagnosed, IBS
And that's irritable bowel child, I had to spit it y'all
Kick to y'all, so it ain't my fault if I shit on y'all
Get it, get it, get it, get it?

My baby mama, mama, and my grandma
Say that I'm too gaudy (too gaudy), word to my blue Mauris
This is a true story
I got stomach pain, don't matter sun or rain
Thought that it went away, uh oh, here it come again
My baby mama, mama, and my grandma

And things just wasn't the same
So I ran up on him, then pulled my MAC out
And I blew out his brains, haha

Y'all wanted violence, we move in silence
Silencer silence the guns (the guns)
I was the wildest, that was childish
Now I stack my ones
Shinay was in love with her school, Rich wasn't liking his school
Shinay caught two in the ribs (in the ribs)
He was a hustler, she's a customer
Now he's off doing a bid
T got shot with a shotgun on his block
I wish it was all pretend
Nana getting high, hard enough getting by
When is it all gonna end?
Me, I'm still holding on, the team still rollin' strong
The Ave. is down the street (down the street)
But I'm a street target, call me the meat market
I stay around some beef
The block's still pumpin', isn't it something?
Needles, knives, and nines
There's no tomorrow, food getting borrowed
What kind of life is mine? (Life is mine)

He tried to play me, shit got all crazy
And things just wasn't the same
So I ran up on him, then pulled my MAC out
And I blew out his brains, haha

They call me Patty Cake Patty Cake The Bakers Man, I bubble bread (bread)
Beef don't stop, who's this year's knuckle head? (knuckle head)
We done scrapped and scuffled until our knuckles bled (bled)
Shot out in front of police, yelled ""Fuck a Fed!"" (fuck the Feds)
I patrol on d low, po-po know my steelo
Who seen Killa cop? Niggas rollin' cee-lo
Pump the peddle bike, nice chain, light chain
Fiends sniffin' white 'caine, needle, 40 and night train (that's Harlem)
Just a hype lame, you don't love 'em like Dame (why?)
Three years ago I would've robbed his dice game (true)
Life's changed, my snipe game's the right mayne (what's the difference?)
Only difference is I'll push you to that right lane (whip in traffic)
Gotta laugh y'all that's just blue lightnin' (the Lambo)
Or that white thing, you on the internet pricin' (pricing?)
I don't window shop, not, me and Jim go cop
Hop through the window, I- god damn them Bimbo's hot (hot)
Hot Dukes of Hazzard, they wanna do the limbo, lock
Never had a Pinto OHC, first car a Benzo drop (Mercedes)
""Benz and Bops"", put between my hot wallet
And my toaster, I really had a hot pocket
And I'm saying this real clear, y'all can't chill here
I know real thugs in wheelchairs
Yeah yeah banged up and they still there
Party pop more bottles than a nigga on two feet and some real gear
It's real here, real near, you feel fear, a meals real
They don't cry, if they do cry, homeboy it's a steel tear
Animals; lions, whales, seals, bears
Y'all fruits; cherries, grapes, stale pears

That's why niggas fuck with me
And them ladies loving me, they all put they trust in me
'Cause I flip that killa, man
That's why niggas fuck with me
And them ladies loving me, they all put they trust in me

Like your bitchin' wife and sister might get tonight
Mister right, kiss her right, make sure that her lips get wiped
She don't suck nothing, buzzen, but she lick it nice
She a hummer - nah, plumber - she could ""twist the pipes""
When I was 15, bang-bang, I called my moms'
Cell, she snorting long....that don't even correspond
All the Ganj all is gone, just came from Autobahn
Came back with the foreign Palm (I'll holla!)Shit, before I go berserk, jerk, when I sold it hurt
Urf told me go to school: nah, bitch, go to work! (Get a job!)
And gave the coldest smirk
Right after she stole my work (Where you going with my shit?!)
And the nerve to hold her purse (I'll holla!)

Niggas gonna run down, tell you put your gun down

Oh, oh, I'm about that cornbread
Believe me, I'm beyond dead
I do this for Bloodshed, do it for Bloodshed

I'm heroin and sex in one: dope as fuck
I'm hopin', I'm ropin' the Trojan
And goin' a-hoin', ""open it up""
If not, dogg, I'm choking the slut
Am I poking or what? You got to figure, dogg

Let me tell you 'bout her

Yo, she took me out my stinkin' aces, to the pinkest bracelet
Face it, the basics, no way you could think I'm racist
Got a white girl, tell you that she's quite thorough
Borough to borough, flew me through this white world (from what?)
From Colombia, then she moved to Canada
Now she live in Harlem, right, and you could say I manage her
Met her in '90, Jeru was the Damaja
I wasn't understanding her, everyone was a fan of her
That was confusing her, he was abusing her
That wasn't new to her, bought me a Luger brah'
Of course of course, never had intercourse
Of course of course, without her wouldn't of been a boss
I would flip for my mama, got me getting my commas (get it?)
Paid for my 1st va-ca, a trip to Bahamas (YES!)
Swam in the ocean, I was dishing piranhas
That's my girl girl, yup, so give her some honor, and...

Uh, my pride and joy, I call her butter
When she bake a cake, I told her we'd be lovers
She live with me right, I hide her from my mother
See she wouldn't understand I'm supplying the gutta, nope
I let my baby hang outside with the brothers
Come back, cake on the bed the size of the covers
Shot 5 with a sucka, another 5 with a trucker
Took a hit without paying, get a dime for my butter
That's my homie my mama, second only to ganja
But I did watch her, play Tony Montana
Here's a Quaaludes, yep she'll be back
For them pesos, yep she'll be crack
Watch so bright, money so right
I got 7 workers, she's Snow White
And you know the steez, I'm at the ocean breeze

To war with the coppers
Dogg: Them niggas livin' a lie!
Dipset stay fly!

Killa!
Let's get the riot on, acting like I'm lying, huh?
5 years probation, possession of a firearm (that's New York)
Did the county, bologna like it was ""Ground Round"" (that's Texas)
Zeek ran an ecstasy ring, he on the countdown (North Carolina)
Seran down the V, coke in the whip...he bought the Chaper (Chicago)
Victoria secrets? Nah it was secret indictments
Jim indicted but Kelina from P.C could fight it (uptown Rucker)
Up in the peach, yeah the weed at least he could light it (then what?)
Then Zeek shot, then E killed, then B popped, then me rocked
Yeah, but we shooting back, I'm pulling out the four fifth
If I ain't get 'em yet, believe their name is on the short list
Yeah, niggas nauseous, I'll show you just what nauseous is
We surround fortresses, studios and offices
You should be cautious, kid, 'fore the boss of this off ya lid
R.I.P. right where the portrait is


(Da da do) that means drop it and run it
No fronting 'cause the coppers is coming, like
(Da da do) that's when we popping them bottles
With some models on our hip is some hollows (Dipset!)
Before they shot they had to valet me
Back in New York, my P.O gonna violate me
Said ""why you acting pure as Nixon?"", she said ""you had no permission
To go to D.C...you know that's out the jurisdiction"" (I'm on business!)
""Ma, I gotta eat...I don't know your religion
I got child support, I can't endure the bitching (I can't take it)
Plus some cousins in college, add on more tuition (education)
Said she got me on tape, flipping a quarter chicken (not me!)
Nah...that Persian-white, murder-type, fur was right (about $20,000)
You heard the price, on my neck herds of ice
Vertebrae snapped, gats...huh, I swerve 'em right
Dipset, bitch, yes, peep our urban life
Like lighting herb tonight, cops come, adjourn the site
They leave...U-turn...customers, we serve 'em right
So what your life like?
Mine? Type: nice, light come off the white ice
You: bum-ass knife fights, Killa!


I'm proving this, you losing this, there's nothing you could do with this
I'm disturbing the peace, right? Just call me Ludacris (Luda!)
I don't care who exist, the Exorcist moving bricks
Screw a chick, go outside and give the coupe a kiss
Can't pop fly, I get my socks tied
I'm being watched by News 1, Fox 5
CNN, NBC, CBS, creep in my home
Paparazzi, magazines: please leave me alone
Yeah I VV'd the stones, dogg, I'm into cake
I sell records but my real job: interstates (""I"" Whatever!)
I been an ape, diamonds in the dinner plate
I'm a winner, fish in my crib, I got a winter lake
And the fountain right, nope, I won't pronounce the price (nope!)

If we was playing pro-ball, every game I'd be slamming on 'em
Step on my competition, yeah Duke I'm standing on them
I ran up on 'em, pussy ain't have his hammer on him
Pulled the cannon on 'em, blammed it on 'em, 'til I jammed it on 'em
I got some A-rab's hitting me with coke
And when we on the phone we be speaking in some codes
A camel is an ounce, a kufi is a brick
Tell him I need 5 kufis, and meet me on the strip
Yeah I know ""Stafalla"", but I'm tryna cop some cars
Run up in the club that's popping and cop the bar
And everything I hear is garbage to me
You know where I be faggot, bring the drama to me
I'm Presidential nigga, Bush'll pay homage to me

I don't care if they small or some stocky niggas
I just grace 'em then erase 'em, I forgot these niggas....
What they name again?....What they claim again?

You procrastinated so I got you assasinated
Shoot 'em up, bang bang, bullets in his Red Monkey's
Thought he was a gorilla? Nah, he a dead monkey

We blastin' big Tecs (Tecs)

Cheddy heavy so fuck being some petty king (fuck all that)
Can't be nice right? Can't be arrogant

Steer a brick, pie it up; supply the stuff, fly as fuck

From New Jerse to the curb, make absurd figures
Stop lyin', picture me poutin'; dog, could you fish in a fountain?
Bad bitch switchin' and bouncin' (in what?) in that Christian Louboutin
Word, on everything, on everything, you still in spinners
Know what I feel in the winter? 80 degrees, deal with a winner
I know some rowdy rowdy niggas that rock a Audi proudly
One thing 'bout me: doubt me, bounty Saudi shout me
I'm sprayin' it well, I'm playin' the sell
Fifty mil like David Chappelle, my paper propel
Won't lay in a cell; you takin' a L

This is fun, nigga; you should run, nigga
Get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya, get ya gun, nigga
This is fun, nigga; you a dumb nigga

Juvenile gun possession is a problem

I wish I could.....
I gotta leave the hood alone eventually right? (I don't know)

Leave the 'hood, I would but it got Cam twisted (twisted)
When Mikey gon' get that butter or them damn biscuits?!
Mother still getting high, she so damn gifted
Like she got no legs though...she can't kick it (nope)
We can't kick it, my man dig it, I Van Wyck it
Wicked wiggle, the man wicked, rap was Cam's ticket (that's what I thought)
But it backfired, air in the back tires
Get ready for crack buyers, rap liars and trap wires
Thinking I'm awry, we thinking I'm raunchy
Watch ""Menace II Society""...think about Chauncey (shhh, think about that)
The snitch factor, now it's a big factor
Shit, life's a bitch watch ya shit for you pitch after
Get dadda, Michelle home from school, her man Rich slapped her
Kitch scratched her, shot in the air...yeah kids scattered
Cause she joined a fraternity...the bitch ""Kappa""
He ain't like it, kidnapped her
In the hood, bitch cracker
Now Rich not....she could of met a rich cracker
She get high, worked at Mickey Dees, they Big Mac'ed her
They'll train the fighters, Titus gained Arthritis
Cops they train the buyers, with Kelina can't indict us (nope)
He beat them cases up like Mike Tyson '86
That's why it's like I got a license for these 80 bricks
Crib, tried to raid the shit
Agents on some hater shit
$60k to rob the kid, them cases never made 'em stick


I can promise this, you dealing with a Communist
That'll pull the trigger on any nigga and bomb a bitch
My accomplices...they remain annonymous
And they gon stay there, I swear....I'm what honest is
Honestly you thought I quit like Tomjanavich
Conglomerate, treat you like Ramadan...honor it (y'all won't eat!)
Y'all won't eat, I'm unloading a lobster & pasta
Y'all imposters, imposing my posture....I gotcha
Mobsters with choppers, enough ""dado"" (that's chips)
Chicks...duct tape em, turn 'em over....butt rape 'em
Grams...cut, shave 'em, damn hair cut shavin'
But bust on her hussers like a lust....Wes Craven
That's the hustle...I'm old school, you must page him
Whatever love hate em, won't do...touch, play em...
Degrade em? talk slick...fuck it your all sick
Lay you in dog shit, look over you...hork spit
Beef on Bobby block, right where his homeys walk
Homey we make bodies drop..then skate like Tony Hawk
Over short paper, play a O for very long
Fourth of July: M80's, cherry bombs (what's that?)
They'll disguise the slugs
Sent his friends for them ends
They had 'em like the Benz:
His eyes was bugged

Hell Rell and a model sitting in a GT

First come love, nah it ain't love
I'm a gangsta, make her hold my guns and my drugs
Yeah I know she feeling a gangsta
But it's hard for her to deal with a gangsta
'Cause there's certain things she gotta do to keep me happy
Fry some good chicken, when I hit it call me daddy
I'm from Weeks Ave mama, I get cash mama
Those some sexy thighs, I like that ass mama
I'm something like a G cause I bust my mag
Mama you don't love me, you just love my swag

She fly (she fly), she cute (she cute)
She ride (in what?), in coupes (oh)
She shrewd, she nice, she rude (Killa!)
But she still want something new

And I'm lactose intolerant
Pack toast, no tolerance
Black MAC in backpack, Blackjack and holla since
Any turbulence (turbulence), we'll go to Providence
I keep the murder tints, on the Impala mint
Any murder prints? (shh), no acknowledgement
I go to work sir (sir), she in college miss
If I like her I'm cuffing her
The wife of a hustler, be nice to ya customers (customers)
When she bite it I muzzle her
Tight when I cuddle her, that's right when I puzzle her (puzzle her)
Yeah I'm right for the jugular
I ain't tryna juggle ya, diamonds when I smother her, Killa!

And you know all my guns got a muffler
Just wanna see the slut in her, I don't want a hug from her (nope)

I done stopped and styled Hummers, rock for wild summers
The nerve in me, these courtesy of Crocodile Hunter, that's right
That mean they croke-adile, see y'all niggas chokin now
You know my style, you know I style, get money poster-child
Crib, piece, I swear you should come over child
Garage, Benz, Lamborghini, Rover fouls
Red, blue, green like the average frog
Don't be mad at dog, Ferrari out the catalogue
Bracelet switched to bangles, medallion, shit just dangle
Chain twist and tangle, you'll get ripped and mangled
Hit from angles, I told you we equipped with angels
Can't find you, your girl, tape her wrists and ankles
Show her the click clicker, better yet six figures
Ask her, ""Where that nigga, bitch? He a bitch nigga""
The big picture, get figures, my kicks glitter
Get with us, in the basement longer than Big Tigger

Triple up, trey eight, four nickel tucked
Get some weight on your ass, give them nickels up
This is for my fly ice niggas
Kilo breast, chicken wing, fried rice niggas
Quadruple up, triple five on me you stupid fuck
Take your ass up the block doggy the stoop is us
This is for my Benjamin bitches
You don't need 'em, get money credit scam bitches

Killa, uh
Ayo, your clique is soft, my wrist is frost
I just pick a Porsche, guns we strap 'em on then we lick 'em off
(Pap, pap, pap, pap)
Got a sickenin' loft, you know how much the kitchen cost
You bitchin' boss, get 'em crossed, best bet don't piss me off
Listen horse, a lot of niggas I did endorse
Of course makes me nauseous when they call the force
Only force I call is the Holocaust
Holla scholar, bodies drop when the dollars tossed (35 hundred)
Hot stove, jelly jar, bakin' soda
Hot water, mask, gloves, can't take the odor
But I make the quota, hate cats that fakin' older
""Remember back in the days"", man them days is over
Know it might seem I'm sellin' y'all a pipe dream
Wolf tickets, nope, been a legend since 19
And that was in the late 1990's
You late, homeboy I kept them 19's shiny, Killa, easy

Triple up, trey eight, four nickel tucked
Get some weight on your ass, give them nickels up
This is for my fly ice niggas
Kilo breast, chicken wing, fried rice niggas
Quadruple up, triple five on me you stupid fuck
Take your ass up the block doggy the stoop is us
This is for my Benjamin bitches
You don't need 'em, get money credit scam bitches

I came a long way from gettin' hanged by a white jury
Look at my neck, all you see hang white jewelry
I triple the chain, triple the wrist
Dice game the same night, I throw triples and split
I get ménage à trois, that's triple the chicks
Got 'em on a triple beam, takin' trips with the bricks
My clique, the weight watchers, we wait for niggas with watches
Or watch niggas with weight with cake in they wallet
Rapin' they pockets and takin' they projects
If you flip like T-Mobile I could make you a sidekick
Shit you see a profit one day off of my flip
You gotta go triple, just say that it's my shit
But for now get ya hustle up
How you talk about triple when you still trying to double up
This the bubble music, hoes with the bubble butt
Bubble coke, and they bubble coke to cop that bubble truck

Triple up, trey eight, four nickel tucked
Get some weight on your ass, give them nickels up
This is for my fly ice niggas
Kilo breast, chicken wing, fried rice niggas
Quadruple up, triple five on me you stupid fuck

Full speed, no slowing down
I told her ""drink up"" then blow it down
Stay loaded up when we roll around
So as I'm pulling up, your girl going down
? life, all vamped up
My passport pages all stamped up
Bitches in the back all cramped up
All we need is by the pool, get tanked up
I got the juice: Tropicana
Brand new goo: drop banana
Bluetooth and I got a scanner
And a Samsung ? since I got a hammer
I drink, get drunk
And when my cup it on E I fill up
Up top, mo shots, stay poured up you know it don't stop
Pour it up!

We living life fast, full steam ahead
Shipping shots of Ciroc, flavor berry red
And that cranberry drop, yeah it's very red
We gon celebrate life til a nigga dead
Swagged up and you know what's going down
Polo from head to toe, I don't really horse around
Find a bad chick in the valet, bring the Porsche around
Mama, I'mma probably forget your name if you don't jot it down..
New rocks, how the face look?
I heard the chick look better on Facebook
You got a funny lifestyle like Dave Cook

No redemption, but I got my shawshank
9-tec, masked models, hoodrats who are skanks
Fuck with me, show you where the bottom is
One back of your dome, homes, ride or miss
Out your element, make you irrelevant
Hood nigga, true Wu, defined with elegance

I'm a giant in the climate, stay elephant",https://genius.com/Camron-party-tonight-lyrics
Child of the Ghetto,Public Enemy #1,2007,"Let's do the Eastside one time
Metro North, East river, Wilson, Club 99
Jefferson, Charleston, A.K., Jackie Rob, Clinton, Taft, Carver
Lakeview, 1990, Wagner, Taihino, Harlem

I don't care if you a old head, or a young buck
I'm not a elevator, I'm no come-up
Nor do I go down, do like Brand Nubian, slow down
Whole clique, blow pounds
Silencers steady, that's no sound
Circle ya block ock, merry-go-round
Here we go now, I'm the owner
You the pitcher, this block is your mound
Buildin' a beast so villains can eat
I reside on the West, chilled on the East
If I say that I rock, then sayin' is gossip
I lived in the nine, stayed in the projects
Scored 39 then I wait for a profit
Taught, pull the 9 then I spray up a object
Homie, don't confuse me, pardon mine
I'm the Harlem World Karlton Hines
Get it right nigga

A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't to gain a degree
Rippin' and runnin', they gunnin' and aimin' for me
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me

Killa, uh, uh..
I don't really buy jewelry, I take 'em
I don't listen to artists dog, I break 'em
I don't really look at movies, I make 'em
I'm filet mignon, and you a steak-um
Any beef, I'ma open it probably
I got some dudes hopin' ya try me
I got hoes, sell coke in a lobby
I'm rich bitch, sellin' dope is a hobby
You peepin' at candy, heat did they hand me
I be in the Lamby, you with your family
Talkin' gangsta, the church ya visit
You're roller bladin', circus and picnics
The underworld, the circuit I live in
You keep your biscuit, we're workin' with chickens
That's the rules that were laid to me
Why you think they call me KFC
You don't know me homie

A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't to gain a degree
Rippin' and runnin', they gunnin' and aimin' for me
A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me

Killa, Killa..
'91 to '96, yeah Harlem was out
Grant's Tomb, balled out in Laguardia house
Huh, stand in the lobby, Cam and his posse
Steak and cheese sandwich from Heaugies
It come to her-on, the biggest of Dons
Since, Guy and Nicky, Fisher and Barnes (snitch)
Triggers and bombs, hit the alarm
I would, kick in the door, click on ya moms
I fell to the arm, in jail we roasted
If bail was there, bail got posted
Like, in Boston at one point boo
The bail it was 1 point 2, get the money nigga

A child of the ghetto, nobody explain it to me
Livin' the scripture the picture they painted for me
Knew what it wasn't, it wasn't to gain a degree

Dead the Funeral,Public Enemy #1,2007,"'For leaf big blowgun, fag nigga's bitch, doj' an'
Peach chrome, sick Rover, Zeek home, the bid over
He looked at me and said ""Killa I'll be your kitchen pitcher, the bid was rough""
I said nigga I did the bid wit' ya
Capiche, not Mona Lisa it's the big picture
Six scriptures, six blickers, grip triggers, strip niggas
The Big Dipper, swig liquor, big liver
Now that you home watch the shit differ, I dig nigga
Soon as a nigga whisper, believe we jiggin' Jigga
He Elton Brand in a barber chair, he'll get the Clippers
I don't care who you are, the point, don't be stupid pa
We celebrities with guns, shooting stars
Yeah remove ya bras, a few of ours in through-in cars
Spray 21, Blackjack, I knew ya cards
Kid roll, Peter Rowe like Kennedy
Friends with me at the graveyard, visits from old enemies
Some bitched, some snitched, some owed us dough
Piss on the tombstone, write on it, ""Told you so""
Check my portfolio, I was poor then rose to dough
KNow what I'm about in a drought I score, overflow
I'm the waterboy, wet work for water call
The price is nice, TLC, some waterfalls
Fiends snort it all, this fact I report to y'all
Go inside, extort them all, from short to tall you oughta ball
And where the ballas live and all my friends all to win
This the second time around, that shit you call again
Damn yo' lady fine, you been on yo' baby grind
Me I'm 86, highest temp, P-89s
Everyday we shine, fine, don't pay me mind
My watches are retarded, you can call 'em crazy times
Mines are more than brothers
We gon' rock til the Range, Benz, and Porsches clutter
Garage, assorted colors
Yeah Crayola box, for that, payola doc
I'll lay you over a stroller with the strangest odor ock
Is it over not, huh, we immune to you
We shoot the wake up, straight up and dead the funeral
Break*
Ay yo hold the fuck up
I said we gon' shoot the wake up and dead the fu--
You dead already we gon' dead the fu--
Matter fact son, bring that shit back up, fuck it

And you heard Rell, I do worst than foul
They murdered Roberta, lawyer murdered murder trials
We deserve to style, walk on Persian tile
On the island with millions, Durst to Al
I get cake in layers, not the Daily News
But when I flip, I make the papers, hate the mayor
I'm a gangsta, I fuck ma, go date a player
Man these dudes are fish market, straight fillet ya
Went to war with Cuomo, then Pataki
Then Guilliani, then I went to North Cackalacky
What you gon' tell a mobster, cake was hella proper
No Petey Pablo when I saw them helicopters
That's the letter niggas, trick us from the ghetto bird
Her word said I gave the whole ghetto birds
Man your case go find it, need a new assignment
That ain't giving out, first of all it's called consignment
Contest to play
You got no gunwounds, jail time, felonies, real shit on your resume

I walk in nike town
I tell em wipe me down
But the fun begun
Yes its summer hun
Somebody call chuck and flav im PE #1
Get the S1W's professor griff
Let it slide? nope im at home plate with the catchers mitt
There go cam braggin
Nana mad cause my pants saggin
All she said is ""you's a hot mess""
I tell her I ball, baby look at my walls
Shop on the ground I get it out the skymall
Its young CNN, NBC, CBS, TNT, HBO, showtime, CBS
See the borrough G5, yes sir GPS
One diamond 100 carats yes sir V.V.S

When i got dressed
Rather when i got fresh
Pants sag, gun on, nana said you's a hot mess
You's a hot mess, you's a hot mess, umm you's a hot mess
Boy you's a hot mess

Yall are my clones, fresh whips fly homes
Careful when u drive home, youll walk into a cyclone
Over them dry stones
Fiends slept in front of my crib for 2 days straight, like I had the iphone
Pies on i'll bet some pies on
The 2,4 and 6 train the only thing theyll ride on
Ask em why play with my pay
I pitch China in Boston, like Daisuke that white yay
And all this carrot cake, well its enough to irritate
But im so fly high i fuck around and wear a cape
And pardon if you in the garden just beware of bait
They starvin, niggas eatin, nope they wouldn't share they steak
Youll find em out of state near a lake severely raped
Gettin ate by some apes, deers, bears or snakes
So I tuck the llama, yeah enough with drama
I seen a nice slut, big butt with a touch of honor
I let her touch the ganja
I could be ya sponsor
I got one mother right, but i could use another mama
Did I pop? yes. hit it hard got dressed
And all the bitch said ""killa you's a hot mess""

I'm gettin' cake, fetti, cheddy, makin' mucke
She said she hate a pusher, I said I hate a booger
A snotty attitude, she laughed, I purple haze and kushed her
My charm captured her, she havin' man trouble
I'm havin' woman problems, it all began in Harlem
Wife with the Lou' Vuitton said I'm livin' wrong and I did her wrong
Forget the song, I swear I love her to death but we can't get along
Her problems big as hell, her dad died man, beat her friend crossed up
Ma Breast cancer got laid off and plus her son got sickle cell
Damn mami, hit the L, Misses Bell got shit to tell
Sounds horrific, ain't a doctor, but your son I wish him well
Under this damn pressure
She looked at me, I looked at her and then Cam measured
Started to Sanchez her

Tell you some dudes might fight some
Gunplay, day time and the night come

Lack of communication, well that there destroys a nation

And once the grape get dry, hope y'all enjoy the raisin
Tanya never checked the check, Kim gettin' high, no self-respect
What you expect, MTV, naaa, crack got Direct Effect
Plus all the side-effects, they coming fully-loaded
And then divide ya death, fuck protect, better hide yo' neck
So I play homebase, and I keep a chrome case
And a lawyer just incase I catch a case, it's a very long race
Moving at the wrong pace, hope you got strong brakes
My crew ain't nuttin' but candles, yep we sittin' on cake
And all these birds we pitchin', well they're absurd and sickenin'

Kill My Dog,Public Enemy #1,2007,"(I miss you homie.  Yeah)
See they kilt him on a Sunday
We was supposed to do a song that Monday
Had dreams of getting on, one day, somehow, someway
We would jump at the chance, like a good pump fake
Said we wouldn't change and stay hungry
But if I keep it funky 
Even Pac had to do the Humpty
Sometimes bummy with a stack on him
Sometimes fresh with cracks on him, figure him out
He never shouted when he rhymed (nah)
Respected words, could move mountains with his mind (word up)
His best was first
We in the hood, and I'm stressing (I'm buggin)
He said they kill Martin Luther King, but not his message
The jewels he dropped
He never bragged about the tools he copped (never)
But he had 'em
One rule, shit, if they try to rob me, get at 'em
And that's the way he fell up in Harlem
He stuck to his words, they had to kill him just so they could rob him

Asking why?
The nigga had to die?
It don't make sense
(Shit is crazy, man.  The nigga just ain't give up the fucking jewelry, man.  Damn.)

Z died in '97
March 2nd, before 9/11 (World Trade ???)
He won't see my Porsche 911 or the crystal in my place
He dead, they said, get him a page on MySpace (get out my face with that)
I turned my back and think
I embedded the wreath??? (me)
The casket drop, huh, I was dead on my feet (like a pallbearer)
Yeah he resting in peace (what?)
But because of him (what?)
It's plaques on my wall, ya'll, instead of my teeth. (thank God)
Madison Ave, got the leathers from North Beach (the hobo joint)
Beamer in Philly, got broads from Broad Street
He had the Honda Accord, made it more sweet (what up skeet)
We balled every summer like West 4th Street (not the tournament)
Now your face on the wall, next to liquor you figure
They could read what you wrote
Scripture is next to your picture (got your lyrics next to it)
Might shed a tear but real men are here (believe that)
It's hard to believe, my nigga, it's been 10 years, yeah


His kids won't know him
Who they father was?  I'm a show 'em
The world rotating in slow motion
Lights are dim
Hands crossed in his casket, no life within
Some people they are phony
I might be wrong, but it's easier to struggle with your homie
I write this song with a swift pen
And just then, the shit kicked in
Like, I'll never see my nigga again (never)
I can't meet him outside (nah)
Dead, we can't play live
Bum joystick, he can't take mine
Called him a rebel with a cause (cause)
Shit was strange, but there's things you can gain in loss
That was my dog (dog)
To the deathbed, I'm missing you bro (I miss you bro)
Ya, still chasing dreams, still sick with the flow
I gotta breeze, but I'm a see you in a minute (one minute)

Now I feel like Carl Thomas... (wish I never met her)
Understand baby girl I love when I'm with you
Then a tear comes down, she touching a tissue (don't cry)
I ain't coming to diss you, I'm discussing it with you
See the sex is great, but trust is the issue
I hug and I kiss you, with a doubt in mind
You out of sight, but out of sight is out of mind
You out your boundaries clowning me (I ain't having that)
You sneaky, she said no, ma you snuck around with me
(That's how we met)
I know you down for me, don't be ridiculous (and look stupid)
But I'm kind of wild, and you're promiscuous (you know you a flirt)
Feeling like this, I'm sick of this

I wanna give a quick apology to a couple people my man Tom Gist, Robert Earl, Early Light and Hazardous of North Carolina we got some unfinished business we gonna take care off
The biggest apology to my man Funk master Flex & Team Bump well everybody over there my man Paul and Mrs Funk master Flex. I'm sorry I missed a couple of appointments over their. I got an idea though flex. The next car show we can have at my house. I just flew in a Saleen 7 a three seater Volvo. Along with a whole another assortment of shit I ain't gotta talk about right now. We'll get some velvet fucking rope, and take the shit off and have the next car show at my house
Now, I never seen such foolishness, buffoonery, hogwash and a bigger baffle ever in my life. I must applaud y'all, I must applaud y'all
First I got punched in my eye, WORD
Then I got a black eye, WORD
Then I got a broke jaw, WORD
Then I got robbed, again, WORD
Ayo, check this out
Next time y'all doing a movie, just send me my script. I promise I'll play my part a little better man. Please just send me the script ahead of time, please
But I guarantee y'all man, that dark day is coming baby. But y'all know what I think? I went and bought everybody some rings, everybody who was talking I bought y'all some rings. Not for your fingers, for your toes dude. And for your belly button no homo dude. Put them on immediately, I'ma come drop this shit's off put em on your toes and your belly buttons immediately. Then go get your eyebrows arched, after that
Now let's get to some immediate business, Jim Jones. That is my partner, that's my friend. He ran with me over 10 years, he deserves all the success he gets, he's worked hard to get it, but y'all motherfuckers got to realize, ain't nothing lasting forever. I wish that man nothing but the best of luck, and success, and I hope he goes all the way to the motherfucking top, and have a great career. Best of luck beloved
Now, last April, fresh off Curtis ass, I was remanded by my probation. When I get down to probation, 107th Street, 11th floor, probation officer, Arrival, how you doing sir. He told me to be there, and I get there as NYPD enter, with YouTube on. NYPD enter with YouTube on? Asking if I got beef with Jay-Z and Curtis for real? I said sir, how do I have beef with people that be with y'all all day. 24 hours a day, how am I beefing with them? This is all Baloney, this like the WWF. He said that's what I thought. You know what here's my card anyway, and you stay in town. If anything goes wrong you let us know. I said yes sir
Two weeks after that, I was let off probation by the honorable Judge Cataldo. Thank you Mr Cataldo. I got a smart remark on T.V. that I was on YouTube saying it was gonna be a hot summer
A week after that landing in Newark Airport, yeah I said Newark y'all I flew commercial. Teterboro is like a fucking bus stop right now, everybody flying in their but I'ma start flying out of Westchester but I did take a commercial flight. I said Newark I landed in Newark. Greeted by who, NYPD enter. I said how y'all doing? He said why did you leave? I said the honorable Judge Cataldo let me off probation, I'm aloud to go where I want sir. They said well we seen's you on YouTube. I said why do y'all keep watching YouTube? Why are y'all on YouTube? He said that's our job to be on YouTube. What y'all mean by hot summer? I said this is business, I explained to y'all this is the WWF. He said well we'll be around this summer just to make sure. I said well stick around. But that ain't even the reason I wasn't here. I had a family emergency that took a few months of my time. But during that time, how the fuck y'all act like you haven't been gaffing. How y'all acting like Curtis do not mean ""police"". How y'all acting like I ain't name this dude's album ""Curtis"". You've been hoodwinked, you've been bad boosting, you've been let astray. Dudes talking about I'm missing. Let me run my motherfucking resume down to y'all dudes
I got six solo albums
Four gold or platinum albums
One movie soundtrack
One platinum movie
I've executive produced 17 albums
How the fuck am I missing man? Catch up dudes

Weekend,Public Enemy #1,2007,"Uh, Killa, Killa!
Harlem World '89, black Jordans they were mine
Hund'-eighth, Toy Dork is the only one ever pay me mind
Baby mine, lady fine (fine), you ever date a dime? (dime)
Before your favorite rhymes, had gator lime
Major crime made me grind, copped fancy heat
You know hater time, cat food, Fancy Feast
Dated Nancy niece, she like candy treats
God damn she sweet, we did Delancey Street
We hopped the D train, you don't understand the streets
No hassle heffer, did we battle? Never
We went Easter shoppin', coppin' them tassled leathers
From Gimbels with game, make it simple and plain
I wanna nibble on ya ear, rekindle the flame
I'm God's child, but yeah I got devilish game
Once you meddle wit' Cam, ma'am it's never the same
So you through with the peekin'?
You pursuin' and seekin'? You know the season
Killa, what you doin' this weekend? Huh? Killa, Killa!

You could be, you could be, you could be, you could be

You could be my, you could be my

You could be, you could be, you could be, you could be
You could be, you could be, you could be...
(But maybe we can try to work it out)

Killa, uh, Killa, uh
Some say that I'm belligerent, others say that I'm ignorant
I don't just experiment, intimate not my sentiment
Every day at the tenement, yayo like I invented it
Scrambled just like eggs, like eggs to benedict
They don't ever remember shit, all they want is their membership
Only one that they gettin' is jackins, that's the end of it
They want designer recliner along with benefits
Won't take a risk, but wanna spend a mick
Wipe 'em off my agenda quick, I need the other gender thick
You see my Monday to Fridays, I need a Friday to Sunday
We'll eat Friday's on Fridays, and go to Sunday's on Sundays
Drink a little liquor, maybe twist a L
Play catch and kiss, if you don't kiss and tell
Take the city bus, or come through with chauffeurs
We could do Air Ones hun, or Louie loafers
Yeah I'm truly focused, take down your Snoopy posters
Put up Killa Season's, now who the reason?
Come through this weekend, huh? Huh?.. Killa

(Weekend girl)
You could be, you could be, you could be, you could be

You could be, you could be, you could be...
(But maybe we can try to work it out)

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh
Killa, Killa, Killa, uh
I drive big cars, puff heaven haze
Not just the weekend, that's seven days
Rev up the engine, not a lemon, it's lemon
That's the color, wanna play 7-11?
You know catch and hump, your butt gotta extra rump
Forget ya man, extra clip, extra pump
Don't mean to be extra, but ma..I extra stunt
Extra money, extra piff, extra blunts
Extra, extra, really some neck I want
Not the dude for help, but you're truly felt
Ass fat, stomach flat, I could see ya Louie belt
Mine on too, for any gunplay
I'm a troublemaker, yeah yeah some say
You're model material, you need a runway
So let's runaway, we could hit the runway
Round-trip not a one way, come play
Rio Friday, Spain on Saturday
Back on Sunday, make work Monday, huh? Killa

(Weekend girl)
You could be, you could be, you could be, you could be
You could be, you could be, you could be...

Can’t Hurt My Style,Public Enemy #1,2007,"Hook:
Y'all little dudes couldn't hurt my style

I got the stainless, the stainless know how to work the fire
I'll leave you brainless then famous, more murder murder guys
My chain, my ring, my chain, my watch, it might hurt ya eyes
Pop pop pop pop pop pop pop pop, baby come work them thighs
I know that coke the iaina, ya know, birds or pies
Bad work, a bloodbath, niggas deserve to die
Look dude, I'm the Dean, don't mean to hurt ya pride
You the wanksta, I'm gangsta, certified
Get with me, physically I'll take you out your misery
My bracelet is Time Square, necklace a Christmas tree
The piece you see across the entire state children
The night version of the Empire State Building
Let's dead the convo, pronto, go condo for condo
Better yet shot for shot, John Doe for John Doe
Y mano y mano, I'm Don Juan Demarco

We pimps and mobsters, with a different posture
Dipped in Prada, pasta on the shrimp and lobster
A side of oysters, plus the scamp we fried
I don't understand it 5, the way he move he can't be live
We still family ties, get ya family tied
Uh, duct-tape, wrong move, ya family dies
Couple hit the kid, couple shots graze the trunk
Middle finger, pay the punk, know who I was raised amongst
The neck tennis yellow, the wrist tennis blue
I'm at the tennis match, L.V. on the tennis shoes
Soon as the tension fuse, we begin to feud
I'm 80 percent of the reason the tenants move
So tell your employer, better yet, tell your lawyer
You wanna see the boy, a 100 million, Dela Hoya
Dude brought your girl to the crib and said ""Enjoy her""
I got it cookin' on the stove, you can smell the Goya

I'm scared of ya'll I'm scared of ya'll I'm scared of ya'll... (quiet)
Yo, ya'll little girls singin a song hoes sing
Ya'll need lower back tattos, toe rings
Eye brows arched, belly pierced the whole thing
Who, oh-no, low blows, to the coke king
I sold blow some thug things, I'm a slinger
I run a drug ring can't put it on yah finger
I wasn't born a singer, but let the storm just linger
I'm the muslim from new york, I'm mortis stringer
Off ice, but on ice, the money chill
Dummi pay attention, fiends still got the funny pills
I'm vest glocked up, yah chest I red dot up
You can taste it, test it, strech it I got the best product baby
I'm a hustler used skills god done gave me
Know them cop cars you can un mark-em baby
Bills they mark-em crazy, keep yah gaurd up lazy
Had run ins with the atf, marks, and navy
Man I might just quit you know the cycles sick?
When they go to court to snitch, on michael vick?
I'm scared of ya'll, I'm scared of ya'll, I'm scared of ya'll
Ay yo! some lean, when I land the lar
A 100 grand handed here
Crystal pets dogs, cats, panda bears
Liqour, came up here reflection off the chandaler
But baby while we're standin here
Let's go another rant a year
Said cam thts the ocean and the sand right there?
I looked at her and nodded like, you damn right there
Mah you drunk too much, yah drink here and here
I love the public but I don't need the fan fare
I read the fan mail it help me hustle when I'm tryna make this damn mail
Or even pay my man bail
I'm jack and jill kept the water in the tan pail
Fuck school told my teacher that I can't fail
Cops in the club sippin on champell, can't tell
Wire on tapein on the hand held
Before you cross the street you need your hand held
Before you get hit, I spit sick, whip dip
Man I might just quit you know the cycles sick?
When they go to court to snitch, on michael vick?
I'm scared of ya'll, I'm scared of ya'll, I'm scared of ya'll
Don't get your rifles, my rivals, don't want no rivalry
Hand on the bible baby boy, I ain't yah idol b?
You don't idol me? shit why you listenin?
No rims o.t I'm ridin on the michelin
I'm tryna get them dividends, a 100, 000 kid a spend
If the edition is new? Michael Biv and them
I might get rid of them the site I might revist in
Pets as my neighbors, I'm a lower body citizen
Shit, I wish the lord could fin my prison friends
To fly to comply, we was on a mission then
Vision girls use to call us the kitchen men
Cause we was cookin more then them whip it whip it in
Let the shit begin, we get it how we ship it in
The shipment, that they shippin, sittin, right there on the ship, my friend
Baby boy that's when you coppin coke, alot to rope
I'm a city slicker, that can knock a boat
Man I might just quit you know the cycles sick?
When they go to court to snitch, on michael vick?

Uh, Killa! Baby!
Kanye, this that 1970s Heron flow, huh?
Yeah, let's speed it up
Ugh, I'm back in, ugh, ugh
They don't know we finna kill the game this year
Killa! 'Ye! C'mon!

Ayo, street mergers I legislated, the nerve I never hated
On murders premeditated, absurd! I hesitated
Observe: cock and spray, hit you from a block away
Drinking sake on a Suzuki; we in Osaka Bay
Playing soccer, stupid, stay in a sucker's place
Pluck ya ace, take ya girl, fuck her face
She dealing with Killa so you love her taste
She swallowing Killa cause she love the taste
I got brought up with crooking, kitchen orders that I'm cooking
But got caught up with the juxes
You would've thought I was from Brooklyn
It gets boring just looking
Did like Bill Cosby, pouring in the pudding
Now the dashboard is wooden from a hard-tangled grammar
Interior, inferior, Star-Spangled Banner
Car game bananas, mob manning tanners
Guns everywhere, like the car came with hammers, he's back

They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh)
The game's in the nooses (No no)
Our girls is the models (Oh)
They coochies the juiciest (Ooooh)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, down)
Yeah, they say he (I'm down, but not out)
'Cause I'm back on my grind (Oh)
Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

I treat bitches straight up, like Simon Says
Open vagina: put ya legs behind ya head
Cop me Air Ones, hon, lime and red
You got pets? Me too: mines are dead, doggy
Fox, minks, gators, that's necessary
Accessories, my closet's ""Pet Sematary""
I get approached by animal activists
I live in a zoo,
 I run scandals with savages
All my niggas get together to gather loot
Bodyguard for what? Dog, I'd rather shoot
I go to war, old Timbs, battered boots
Hand grenade, goggles and a parachute
Y'all don't even know the name of my flip
It was 
Touch Me, Tease Me
 when Case was the shit
You don't know bout the cases I get:
Court case, briefcase, suitcase, cases of Cris', aaow!

They trying to say he (I'm down, down)
I hear niggas saying he (I'm down, but not out)
But our flow is the truest (Oh)

Money back on my mind (No no)
Ye' and Killa Cam', the world is mine (Oooh)

Uh, Killa, yo, yo...
Ayo you dealing with some sure shit, my bitches pure thick
Play razor tag, slice ya face, you're it!
It's I who come by drive-thru
Gator-toed Mauri, three quarters, sky blue
Look at mami: 
eyes blue, 5'2''
I approached her ""Hi boo, how you?
Pony skin Louis? Oh, you fly too
You a stewardess? Good ma, I fly too""
Now a nigga got baking to bake
Harlem Shake? Nah, I'm in Harlem shaking the weight
Shaking to bake, shaking the Jakes
Kill you, shoot the funeral up and Harlem Shake at your wake
Just ya picture though, you still taped in a lake
I'm laughing;
 you couldn't wait to escape
For anyone who owed the dough, I had to load the fo'
I hope a nigga heard when I said ""I told you so""
Uh, Killa

Man I spit that pimp talk, you hang out where the pimps collide
It's a pimp in my ride, no need to pimp the ride
This ain't the pimp camp: pimp limp, pimp stance
Pimp-slap a slim tramp, order steak, shrimp scamp
Ok-k-kay, you g-g-gay
I'll soufflé ya toupée
 and bottles be a bouquet
Right where you stay, or where you stayed
That .45 trey deuce spade sprayed, you stayed
Unload the click-clack to ya fit cap
Hold the shit back, say goodbye and go commit that
For 9 years in Spain had the time share
Back to Times Square...I got dimes here
By the Port Authority, but I got more authority
Your girl she ordered Mauri, checks she forge 'em for me
Reporters report me how she report to the orgy
But it's more to the story: her daughter applaud me

Sanaa Lathan knows, I'm rakin' but makin' dough
80 holes in your shirt, there: your own Jamaican clothes

You get the ""okey doke"", play me, baby I hope he know
We break noses, call him baby Pinocchio

2 pigeons, ""what the fuck are you pitchin'?""
1 house, 2 kitchens...who's bitchin'?
I bring the diesel, won't see the Fu-Schnickens
(And I don't trust a hoe)
That's mother to baby-mother
Motherfucker, you look like a lady-lover
I'll touch slap her, dap her, plus clap her
Tell her drink, come get drunk, it's nut cracker
And it's well known that

We tie dynamite to the rhino type

wino might find yo' sight
Sell the information for a dime of white, that China-China
I'm behind the diner, selling marijuana to a minor-miner
Elder fella; looking for that shine? I'll shine ya
My mind designer.
 
You a dime? I'll dine ya
Madonna momma, 
body bottled,
 you're fine. I'm finer
Time to climb her, climb behind vagina
Then 
I hymen-grind her
 'til 
her mom remind her
Diamonds blind her; vision's gone, kiss her palm
Turn her arm, lift her arm, notice that her wrists is raw
""Gotta get it right ma, we gon' get along""
Said ""how?"" ""don't trip,"" but, yo, the trick is wrong
First visi-on, day job tick-a-tron

Brother Chris and Don, and their sister Carm
They sell yay', you'll say ""yay, this shit's the bomb""

you my pick upon
The rest, so yes, you'll be blessed to hit the intercom

And I get it cheaper, 
I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia
But I give you an earful, it's tearful
Told my mother I hustle and she said 
""be careful""

Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight
?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs
You ain't gotta stare, go cop a pair
Still the scrutiny, nothing they can do to me
I made sure my mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world
 (Killa!)

Everybody like, ""Cam got the recipe now!""
Not them 3 girls, I got to be Destiny's Child (gotta be me)
Specially equities, reckon we smile
Interfere,
 
tech to tech and use the TEC that we wile
Detective deceptive, receptive of fouls
Hectic, 
Heckler & Koch
Helicopters on the set of my sales
Nah, I ain't gonna be embedded in jail
Talking to a cellmate in a bed in a jail, dog
I broke bread with the whale, fled from some seals (what else?)
And the house, I was the head of the hills, shit
You get a dumb ho, and get dumb-happy
Go to the gun show, get gun-happy
 (who are we?)
Stuck, killed, mugged, milled
Tone, flint, sticks, bo, Chub's milk
 (what up, y'all)
Pucci baba, but I got the hardest shells
We the Midwest gun cartel, nigga (nigga)
Ya, we'll just clap up your brains, snatch up your chains
See dog? Rap is my aim
But I'm a hustler, in my heart, trapped is the game
Attached to my frame, tapped to my brain, the fact still remains:
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, 
don't be asking for Dame, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
And anyway, homeboy, you a grown-ass man, shit
And when I rap it ain't no punchline (not at all)
I be on the highway dirty, crunch time
No timeouts homeboy, just one time
If they find that stash box just one time
Shit, they'll put the dogs in the truck
Side of the road, holding you up, you cold as a fuck
They want that button, lunge it and push it
Soon as they lunge it and push it, I run in the bushes
That's how I play mine, jump over the grapevine
Take my chances one-on-one with the K9
Steel and a clip for anyone squealing they lips
Fuck y'all if y'all ain't feeling the Dips (Killa, Killa!)

Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight
?
My life's based upon what I'ma do this year
Cop a boat, cop a Lear
Now the army suit's cute with my chocolate Airs

'Cause I move bricks, get out the yay
And it's 2 clips, I get out to play for
Few chips, I get out and spray
It's more than shrimps, it's whores and pimps
The difference in our crimes, yours attempts
Attempt burglary, attempt theft you just begun
I'm Grand Theft Auto
Racketeering, larceny, conspiracy, murder one
Electric chair, I don't deserve the fun
But I get the dough, shit I might splurge on one
Now I know a lotta styles, some see
But listen, stop it child it's a done D
I come to ya block, stop it's that one D
Gators straight from Crocodile Dundee
No rubber sole, hardwood bastard
Fitted, legitted, hardwood classic
Killa! Uh!

Uh, that shit you talk don't move me nada
The dudes with the Q's be proper
Uzi pop, you news and choppers
It's truly liver, who knew we'd prosper
The game's a bitch, ooh we got her
Shoes, Louis, Prada, groupie blah blah
Santana, Zeke, the kufi popper
We the movie Shottas
But it's really rude bois and Rastas
With a trailer load of girls, excuse me Shabba
I wish my homie could watch me
Live Happy Days like Joanie and Chachi
I stay lonely and cocky
Dice!
Rollin' and rollin' 'em
Cars, the repo are towin' 'em
Ask black, we totally total 'em
Even Blood, he totally totaled it
Plus his life, he totally totaled it
But any girl I get I totally open 'em
Brain and they legs, coke and the dope in 'em

Talkin' tough? (Yo!), smokin' dust (whoa!)
Fuck with us? (No! No! No!)
Get ya head bust

Fuck around dawg, get ya head bust

Fuck with us? (No! No! No!)
Get ya head bust
Get ya head bust
Fuck around dawg, get ya head bust

I spend days on Kawasakis
Nights with Lewinsky
But I'm like the Ice Man, Michael Kuklinski
I style on New York, pile up my fork
The Dips, consulted by the son of Malachi York, doggy
Cause I push weight, plus I push tapes
God damn I'm starvin' and I just ate
I wouldn't say I'm Nino at The Carter
I'm more like the plant in Little Shop Of Horrors
But I don't say ""Feed me Seymour""
I say, ""Feed me Dame, feed me Lyor"" (billions!)
Epic, they used to feed me detours
Roc-A-Fella, they feed me C-4
The way I blow up, the VS just soars
You GS-3, I'm GS-4
You in a Lexus, I'm Gulf Stream 4
Up in the sky, on a gulf stream tour
You want beef? We'll start a Gulf Stream war
Lay ya ass down on God's green floor
We playin' golf in the Gulf of New Mexico
The cost to be the boss, you gotta respect it, ho
My gas game you gotta respect it though
I swear to god you think I'm workin' for Texaco

Uh, uh
You know me dawg, I just wanna keep the peace
But saying my name, that's only gonna lead to beef
Tell my niggas chill, but they wanna heat the streets (Be Easy)
Or do it on record, check-we spit heat to beats
Everybody welcoming this, welcoming that
He wasn't welcome in the first place, how we welcome him back?
Give me the MAC, let me welcome with that
Tell ""Mr. Rogers"", I leave his brains on the trolley track
Now prolly that
Listen, y'all stop It (stop)
Know you appalled, got it
But this my call by the false prophet, all profit (all profit)
Harlem hustler (yep), I can't at all knock it (nope)
But you hard, when you go in the Lord pockets
What you offering, put it right in offering
They take it all, cash, credit, silver, down to porcelain
Look at the Porsche he's in (look at it)
Then give them portioning (to Who?)
No handicap, Annie or her orphan friends
Friends, but the sizzurp I'm drinking on
Birds I'm thinking on
Get your Kirk Franklin on
Word, so you get your Ben Franklin on
Just when you think it's wrong
One blink, he's gone (damn)

Father Forgive us
We gon take him to church
Father Forgive us
And the truth it hurts
Father Forgive us
And that won't work
No, No, No, No, No Way

Yo, you try to handle us
Get on the air and damage us
Screaming out Harlem (huh) like you ain't just abandoned us (Where you been at?)
Well let me fill you in, now it's a whole clan of us
Blink so mad, he went and beat up Canibus
Zeek got shot then Zeek locked up (then)
E got killed (what else?)
 B popped up but
B hopped up and still broke out his chest
On probation, Doe on house arrest (what up Doe)
Right out the flesh
Sit in a house and rest
He don't pout, get him gear, in the house he fresh (Fresssh)
Not that you care, just getting clear and think
One glare and wink
Everyone wearing pink
I'm the reason that your two rings are clear (Yeh, What Else?)
I'm the reason that your ear rings is square (Yeh, hear?)
Now we take trips to casinos, to lovely homes
You check on Lotti's mom, Minos, Honeycombs (Homes)
You trying to fake it with Cardan, pardon
You gonna leave them naked like Tarzan

Remember I'm a man of respect (remember?)
Remember Santana was next
Now it's not TECs, it's checks
And fans he collects
I want his wrist, fist, whole hand, jammed with baguettes
Pose for the camera man
Me and Santana, man
Word to my grandma
He one bad mamma jamma, damn
So I don't write for the stardom
I get, booted, zooted, write down my problems
I've been through it headed right for the bottom
D.C. nah, would've been a sniper in Harlem (so what)
That's why I throw some dough
To my co-d from Kosovo
Help me get on overflow (ssshhh)
No one suppose to know
But she lay me up like the prime minister
Thousand grams of dope smelling like Heinz Vinegar
That was a lot to linger
But to the top I bring her
But when it came to dope, I always copped in fingers
Money missing, oh shit I almost chopped some fingers
Slit some wrist, that's when they said, ""oh shit, he's not a singer""
Fuck the rap, fuck the movies, fuck Siskel and Ebert
This pistol I'll squeeze it, missiles if needed, Killa
Remember I'm gonna spend my cake
Remember Jim we getting out of 5H (projects)
Now chefs'll fry us steaks (that's true), it's a higher stake
Swiss accounts I'm going show you how to wire cake
And we from BBO
Now you a CEO, direct a vee-ee-oh
Your own album here we go
That's my man anytime I holla, holla with me
We shared chicken sandwiches they was a $1.50
Budget seven dollars, nickel bag and White Owl
I hope the chicken sandwich last us through the night, child
We ain't care, we didn't sleep we was night owls
Insomniatics, our lifestyles compatible
Magical, Pops gone, shit tragical
Moms gon' miss ya, my house is where the addicts chill
I'm like a teacher, I need me a sabbatical
It's not irrational, I grew up radical
And you all are shook, I bought all my crooks

But I'm gettin' head, she's bobbin' her weave and (yes sir)
I'm grabbin' her neck to stop her from breathin'
I'ma wild out until I part with my breathin'
Until I'm sparked up and leakin', part of the cement
I need somethin' pure, like from the Garden of Eden (why?)
Wouldn't mind makin' her part of my achievements (what happened)
'Cause when music discourage my pride (who was there?)
Zeek, the only one with courage to ride
The ride's so dirty inside, seems like we were playin' in mud
Hazin' it up, grams, gauge and a snub
Who ill? A check for two mil'
And a cheap case, defaced, blue steel, true skills

Flip water like Poland Spring and I'ma hold them things

And I stop up the drop, Blocka Blocka the block
Hello mate, yellow tape, helicopter your spot
What you wanted is not what you got
And I pop up them cops
'Cause dog, it ain't about Cam (it ain't about me)
I got a son homeboy, it's about Cam (for that?)
It's about being 'bout It
If you're not, you're ass backwards
My mathematics cause cash matters (that's important)

Not golf but like golf, he had plenty gophers
Can't get paid on an earth this big?
You worthless kid, Cam don't deserve to live
Back then I played for Gauchos, went over the Riverside
Young life, turned left, we back over the riverside
Blood played for Stone Gym

We ain't balling for real, where's the stone gems?
Where's the chrome rims?

Seen New Jack City, cop me a couple Carters

Can rock a Jimmy Choo shoe
Next day velour sweatsuit, construction Timmy boots

You drinkin' Henny too
Coupe color is Winnie Pooh

Not a six-fo-five-fo, but made in jump
Shout Che Che La Funk, he keep the K in pump
He ain't never scared, never scared, raise the trunk

Can't paint it; pop it, champagne it
Stop it, car: drop it - it look dull, damn, paint it

How I'm outgoing but don't be going out

The half a tab
You could ask her ass, I would dash and laugh

Whole ride hazy tell her don't drive crazy

Fly lady, G2 fly baby

Please boo, what's your size crazy
Don Juaning when I'm in a foreign
Almond drop top, my charm is alarming
I was alerting her just to reinsert in her
That I will leave earth with her

Said when I do dirt with her
The only time I flirt with her
Not to be V.I but this is B.I (B.I)
Me and G.I be watched by the P.I's
See why we can't finish together
I'd rather do business than pleasure
And that's real (Killa)

If only you could let me in
I know that love it would begin
If only I could rap to you
I know this love would capture you, yeah
Don't you wanna ride?

P.E. with her, wee wee, easy, ol' me, OG little me lick her
So she need liquor, never seen sicker
Nigga, if rap was head, she could be Twista (fast)
Had her alley to alley, Hawaii and Maui, and Cali the Valley
Up in white Lotus, dog you might notice
That you type bogus, me I'm quite focused
And hope is hopeless, disappear in the air, hocus pocus

Females better twirl on yours, better curl on yours
'Cause I swirl on shores (then what)
Come back to a pearl golf course (who you)
I'm Kurupt, 'cause ""Girls All Pause""
And the world is yours, honey sip sizzurp earl of course
And you know I'm in the building mister
With the Olsen twins, or the Hilton sisters
And I haul 'em in to the Hilton mister
I milked them, I killed them, you quilt her, you missed her
You held her, you kissed her
You felt all the blisters, melt on your whiskers

Mommy all on me 'cause I'm touching her belly
I'm on butter Pirellis
Whip purple and yellow, hello
That's butter and jelly
I flip butter on cellies
All right in front of the deli
Holly, Lilly, to Kelly all spent ones on the telly
(And what else) and I got hella gear
My earring is nice, the price:
Three town homes in Delaware
Uh, tomato Porsche looking like tomato sauce
Hip hop hooray, I got to get that yayo off
That's blocks to the ave, cops come blocking the ave
I put the Glock in the stash, slabs and tops in the trash
Still stop and I laugh; ma, get them rocks in your ass
The rest? Twat in ya bag, dag, hop in a cab
Play you, for what? You gonna play yourself
Ain't nobody gon' pay you like you pay yourself
And my way to the wealth was SK, AK, mayday, payday
Dog, don't play with your health

Mami... she open, she open
Jump off... hoping, I'm hoping
Grab her... rope 'em and dope 'em
Oral... choke 'em and choke 'em
I flip bundle to bundle, trying to double my double
At the same time 
But the cops say I'm 

I get fresh from Yankee stadium to the garden
I beg your pardon, stop it
My closet: Macy's men's department
Pants, shirts, scarf, phone if you check it
Get the scoop on the cologne, belt, and shoe section
Fur for fur, baby; baby, you'll go stir crazy
Got that David Yurman burning, the bird gazey
You'll get hurt, play me
Burp, let the dirt chase me
Every third lady that flirt, want my chirp lately
I know some RN's that still strip
When I and this real dick in the clinic
Nurse suit and heels, shit
Better than college, after that, students home
At least after your bid, ain't no student loans
To pay back, jack, ask, ""What do you condone?""
Hit towns with coke, a .45 blue as chrome
They done juiced my dome, knock knock, ""are you at home?""
I'm Macaulay; girls call the crib and ask, ""are you alone?""

Drop top mustard Tahoe
We like the musketeers, trained by Cus D'amato
Just the model, a dozen hollows is tough to swallow
Watch Sanford and Son, I'm like the buzz in Rollo
Fortunado, the Porsche Apollo, wars'll follow
Got the MAC jack, still swing swords like Zorro
We jacking and clapping, y'all just applaud like ""bravo!""
Now applaud the Capo, Zeek and Santana
I don't raise her wrists, I keep eighths of piff
The game's a chick; I'm Kobe, I'ma rape the bitch
Razor grips, laser spit
Glock cocked; J or fifth?

Chi-Town to Harlem, what's really good?

Part 2, what happens, when you combine the darkness, with the light?

Yeah, I am more than compelled and honored to expel
This hell that's inside of my shell for fuckers who want it
Violence, yeah that bullshit right up my alley
Chasing you right up the alley
With a gun fixin' to kill you cause I feel you was the one
Fuckin' with my family (Psycho Drama)
I roll with a gang of go-getters, and them ghouls and them gorillas
Who be quick to put the Glock
Or the gauge to the gut of one of your niggas and pull it
(Psycho Drama)
The trigga and deliver you niggas these rigorous bullets
It's so rivetin' to see you livin' in vengeance sit up
And shrivel to pudding
Fuckin with niggas you shouldn't
These menaces and villains and hoodlums
That'll give you the business
And in an instant be diminishin' whoopin'
'Cause it ain't no type of jokin' or jivin' comin' off of this
You done somersaulted and dived in a coffin of shit
So if you ever get the notion to just motion forward
And get on some hoe shit
You niggas remember that I got that potion
To bore your brain in a bag
And give you a new perspective on who the realest y'all
(Psycho Drama) you just can't kill one you stupid bitch
You got to kill us all..

What can I say to make you see how the fuck I feel
To make me wanna run up in ya home
Shoot you in the dome, if you bustin my body up with the chrome
I still'll be in the zone like Capone
Better leave me alone, cause I represent the city known for killin' motherfuckers
Makin' plenty money and layin' mack down
Cam, Buk and Twista spittin' gritty competition what a pity
You ain't fuckin' with it then put ya stash down
Come at the family you touched, uh
I'll shoot up ya V-12 even if you with ya female, huh
You was talkin' shit nigga wassup
Fuckin' up ya Sprewell's and ya new interior detail
And a nigga standin' too tall to fall, comin' so I hope y'all can crawl
Bloody up the vest all the wall
Sacrifice my body screamin' Kamikaze, I can take all of y'all...

Y'all niggas play around, guns I wave around
Nigga better stay down, lay down, weigh pounds
Put 'em on the Greyhound, ride it up to K-Town (Chi-Town)
The boy get nasty 'til law enforcement blast me
Sawed-off and I'm happy, raw, where the crack be?
Put it right off of Pulaski
Cross street, don't need to be said
Code red, I already got beef with the Feds
Put three in ya head, from the street full of lead
Fuck knee-deep, you'll be six feet with the dead
Street sweeper when I creep creep, nigga fled (Flii-Flii)
When ya sleep sleep, nigga dead
Right on the back block, fight in the crack spot
Jackpot, ask not yes why not..

That's your adrenaline rushhhhh
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
That's your adrenaline rushhhhh
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk
That's your adrenaline rushhhhh
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
That's your adrenaline rushhhhh
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump
And let the rhythm hit off the trunk

Ya bitch is a hoe, she chill at the Rucker, you really a sucka
Big Will tryin' to grill her and cuff her
And Killa done fucked her, in love with the chick, the slut was a fish
Threw her bait, reeled her in and gutted the bitch
And now she, up in Pokip's, dick, huggin' the strip, slick
5th tucked in her hip, she will mug you for kicks
And word to, mother I'm rich, hit ya mother with bricks
Coke or ones you build buildings with, concussion the bitch...

Come and feel with the baller who's the nicest
And causin' the crisis
Got the ammo and agility that says rewind means growin' before
And this livin' and pause and this likeness
I can spit it for some who for nigga represent the call of the righteous
Or gang bang to the rhythm when I spit it
I'ma kill 'em with the technical precision
That'll be fuckin' up all the devices
Get sick with it like I'm lit off the wet
If it's beef, get the shit off ya chest
Don't take off ya vest, all my niggas make you jump off the set
And always get the prints of the TEC, straight off the deck
Mobbin' up and makin niggas duck
Knowin' I'll still open up the trunk, guns nigga we get 'em and bust
Murderin' the enemy is the ultimate adrenaline rush

That's your adrenaline rushhhhh
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun, to make ya body get up and uhh
That's your adrenaline rushhhhh
Like when the motherfucker have to go and pick up the pump
To make the trigger pick up and dump
So turn the bass kick up the bump

Intro (Purple Haze),Purple Haze,2004,"Welcome to Purple Haze
Previously written in 2001...

2 0-4 76, they wired my mom, couple weeks prior to Ja
Must've been the year of
Murderous killers, murderers that murder and kill for scrilla
OGs with herb that guerilla, then turn
Mathematician, subtraction, addition
Division, to the packs and the cracks in the kitchen
Multiplication, rocks that I slash, precision
I gave a little more, few addicts were bitchin'
But in Harlem you get smacked up for livin'
That was a given, rock the hood
Pop the hood, gats in the engine
Clap up your women, accurate vision, Black, I'm just livin'
I'm the bomb but bombs get wrapped up in ribbons (Shiiit)
This the fact from the fiction, packs that I'm pitchin'
Cats in Maximum Prisons rattin' and snitchin'
'Cause when Feds come, niggas mouths run
But the outcome, gon' be 'bout guns
'Cause I don't bitch, and I don't snitch
I work hands on, fuck with Cam'ron
'Cause I kept the grams in the boot
Damn, I would shoot but fam I would soup
Thought Cam was too cute to stand on the stoop
(What I look like?) 
My Spanish recruit, outlandish with loot
We got obsessed with Miami, cannons, and coupes
Baskin' in robbin', I'm laughin' and poppin'
It's all for Bloodshed though, I haven't forgotten
From the night to the days, my triflin' ways
I'ma bring that platinum plaque right to your grave, dog
You chill in the lobby, you feelin' this probably
You know me well, tear in your eye, chill in your body
Take it in stride, let's bake up these pies
Harlem, no homo, hop on and take this ride
To the top of the mountain
Bout to get this shit poppin' and bouncin'
Now that I'm down, the Roc is surrounded (Feel me?)
Afford all the best, but bought all the wet
Down with the Roc, but I'm loyal to my set (Dipset)
I know you niggas hate it
How I got Jimmy out of 5H, and my dog, Zeek situated
Santana is next...",https://genius.com/Camron-intro-purple-haze-lyrics

How I get robbed in Cali? I be with Cali thugs
Got mobbed in Cali, yeah, that Cali love
Come on chatter mouth, have my bling black is out
Stick me what that about, I was the only rapper out
Beverly, Foxhill, Roscos, swap meet
Slausson, Crenshaw, Compton, we not sweet
Like I'm chump change, Jimmy with his dun game
I'm fun aim, LAX gun range
Wife load is Felli Fel, holla'd at the kid proper
If something happen, skip rapping, they'll be big choppas
Ghetto bird word, cause I keep the big choppa
No disrespect, niggas killed Big Poppa
The Williams sister, Romeo from Steve Harvey
Got the drop, get the drop, no please sorry
Got weed on me, no need guard me
I'm what you need probably, I teach robbery

We ride in that east side
Please roll up my weed high
We ride in west side
The city were them TECs fly
That dirty dirty south side
Midwest up top when we outside
But we ride in that east side
So please roll up my weed high

My momma always told me aim for the sky
So I, came out bangin and aiming at guys
It was, mainly slangin that 'caine by the pies
And the, fiends was payin for dangerous high
Blow, peep and ammonia, we mix it down
There's no sleep on the corner, the pitching mound
And police, when the saw us they frisked us down
We hold heat, marijuana, they lick it down
So tell Bloomberg it's a wrizzy
I take it back to '88 and move birds though my city
G.W. Bridge, New Jers with the pizzies
28 a key, the suburbs, they get busy
And fuck the phones, get the word by mouth
When the winter roll around, know the birds fly south (Miami)
And fuck the cops, got hella folks up in prison
Had no other option but to sell coke for a livin'

We ride in that east side
Please roll up my weed high
We ride in west side
The city were them TECs fly
That dirty dirty south side
Midwest up top when we outside
But we ride in that east side
So please roll up my weed high

Killa..
Dope man, smoke man
O's float the coast, damn
Wrote coke and post man, slow jams, cokeland
Throat jams, throw grams, no ma'ams
Sell white throw tan, tell her (I'll holla)
Watch the kid from 140 bake
They say shorty straight
28 grams, turn 4, 48
Lord upstate, bought the cakes
Law offer 4 to 8
All I do ignore they Jake, tell 'em (I'll holla)
I still bubble O's, still double those
Still double my double, down in the double O
From the C.O, love gets sent to Daddy
Akron, Springfield, Cleveland, Cincinnati
That's Detroit, Minnesota, Greenpoint
Naptown, Sactown, The Lou gots some mean joints
We orangutan it, a range bang it
Deranged strange
Like Pac I'm Gang Related (Killa, holla)

We ride in that east side
Please roll up my weed high
We ride in west side
The city were them TECs fly
That dirty dirty south side
Midwest up top when we outside
But we ride in that east side

Whips on my fists, houses on my wrists
Your budget on my neck, your spouse on my dick

Fuck a Sizzler steak; my estates, they sizzle

Purple Haze (Advance Version),Purple Haze (Advance),2004,"Tito, crack that dutch
Roll that purple up
Niggas slacking in their macking
Simpin' in their pimpin'
Glad I got you baby
You the only one I can count on, man
You my crutch man, yo

We leave spots milked, you get your top tilt
Mop filled, my block leaves cops killed, duck shots still
You not built, you had zirconia's, those was zirconia's
I kept it spot built, I can ensemble linen
Grinning on rock, silk, I'm hitting bitches like switches
I'm a top Wilt, that's Chamberlain, mama became a friend
Said she had the lamest men, wanted to learn the game I'm in
I had to game her then, you rearrange your friends
Then you change that Benz, we need a Range with Rims
She bought a gravy Rover, it had a pastry odor
Yes she made the quota, 'cause I'm like Ray Liotta
Fiends in a caskets, leaning them bastards
But the meanest of fabrics, when I'm with Athena Onassis
Or Ms. Trina, the queen of the asses
Causes when it come to purple, I've seen it in masses

Woo! Tito, you almost finished? (This ain't purple neither Tito)
This blunt almost out right here (I don't know what this is)
I love you man (I'm not smoking this)
Only thing I count on is you (Tito I want him, I don't want him)
Tito just got the blunt, (Don't fuck with nothing else but you)
I'm reloaded now (God damn)
(Tito roll me up another blunt, something ain't right with this)

And I'm a nuisance child, game in a stupor now
Plus, I'm stupid foul, pulled a coupe to trial
I come through Canal, and let the Luger style
In the DA mouth shit, here's a root canal
Right on center street, put 'em on front street
Next day the front page, who gonna front on me
Girls deranked and chumped, call 'em skank and cunt
Take a trip with the Dip bitch, to the bank to stunt
Serena Williams, down to Ivanka Trump
Who wanna bang her rump, chump, yes I bring the pump
That's why I'm kinda hyped, because my money's good
Which means my mind is right, so I got time to write
How I grind at night, Next tab, china white
Army hat, army jacket, yes sir my line is right
Diminish his army, we finished the Dom P
Now let's get purple like Grimace and Barney
Holla

I gotta come in now, I don't know what Tito's rolling up
I gotta roll it up my self (I don't know what's in them Dutch Masters)
If you don't crush your own weed up
And put it in the blunt yourself
Your own brother'll hand you some dust

Hey Lady,Purple Haze (Advance),2004,"Uh, Killa (Dipset)
Jim Jones, my man DJ Nasty in the house tonight (c'mon)
Let's get ready to do it, ma {hey lady}

I know you heard me in British Raj
But I get you bracelets 'til ya wrist is throbbed
Just kiss the knob
And put your meat on my stick like a shish-kebab {hey lady}
Out mingling, heard that I blingy-bling
But I run the circus like Ring-a-ling
I'm the king of things
And your man, he a homo like Jangle Leg, Jangle Leg {lady}
That's life, hit 'em with the pow-ping
Pow, pow, .45 loud thing
Look wild thing, I do wild things
Make China stretch like Yao Ming {hey lady}
Ching chong, ma ga hai ah, Chow Mein
I'm bilingual, ma, I don't need a nickel, naw
Oh, you tickled, ma? 'Cause your nipples, huh?
Coming through your shirt, nearly ripped your bra {hey lady}

I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swole up, ice all froze up, sing {hey}
And while y'all acting surprised, like we don't sell them pies
They way we hold up, papi hold up, mami roll up, sing {hey lady}

I know it's school and work, but you need to be schooled in work
Put my tool to work
I'm feeling your shoes, your purse
You get low on dough, refuel the first {hey lady}
I don't need you high like I'm high
But shit, I need you fly like I'm fly
Fresh Louie Vuitton ankle
Pastel Louie Vuitton rainbow {hey lady}
Threw on the Kangol, threw on Durangos
Not from the 'nati but threw on the Bengals
Moved on an angle
Like a bull and matador, the two gon' tangle {hey lady}
Shake your body, mami, move your body, hottie
Its true I'm kamikaze, I move in a Maserati
They all polly-polly, rude boy, dolly-dolly
I don't talk like they squalie, mami {hey lady}

I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swole up, ice all froze up, sing {hey}
And while y'all acting surprised, like we don't sell them pies
They way we hold up, papi hold up, mami roll up, sing {hey lady}

Killa..
Lady, dry your panties
Damn, she wanna write her family
Tell 'em that I'm a diaper dandy
And I got all type of candy {hey lady}
Whats that? Victoria Secret?
Here's La Perla, come peep it
This lingerie that you could honor, ay
Wonder Woman, woo wee, go on, play {hey lady}
Like Cam watch, like Cam ring
Like Cam chain, like Cam bling
Heard Cam sing, if a damn fling
Goddamn, ma'am, not a damn thing {hey lady}

I see the hate in your eyes, damn them boys is too fly
The way we roll up, rims all swole up, ice all froze up, sing {hey}
And while y'all acting surprised, like we don't sell them pies
They way we hold up, papi hold up, mami roll up, sing {hey lady}",https://genius.com/Camron-hey-lady-lyrics
Lord You Know,Purple Haze (Advance),2004,"Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

With my muscle you'll be dazzled, but hustlin's a hassle
Percocet, Demerol, capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you; they runnin' with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those incarcerated, who had it confiscated
Hate it when they take powder
Upstate he take showers
Baby moms on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man face-to-face through the glass
On the phone. 10 years he got, chasin' that cash
Cocaine, he had that game in a smash
Felt like the Towers when the planes went on crash
It wasn't 9-11, but it was 9-1-1
Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in, I had to find that dumb

Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

Ayo, them niggas from the three two, said I can't breeze through
The 40 if I cop bottles, we can't believe you
Me who? Please boo, 
landin' in that G2
Same color as beef stew, favorite letters: GQ
That's me, true, peach/blue
, Hebrew
Lawyer on my side keep me out of jail the fees stew, steep? Woo!
But it might lead to that R2D2, the mobsters creep through
We the new PE, shittin, pee-ew
To the hood: y'all don't need me, I need you
'Cause my mission's insane, you couldn't vision the pain
Always a snitch in the game, what you want: prison or fame?
Either one, dun, long as my digits the same
He lookin' frigid, dig it, make sure them digits get changed
'Cause I can't be in Hell's cell
, 
shout out to Mel Mel
Cash and Hell Rell, Zeek doin' 3, he even fell, hell
He comin' home on '07 and 12 cells
'Cause you must have known, I can't trust the phones
For the dough you'll be like Doe, stuck at home

Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

Nowadays dog, they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze 'em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost ark
I'm like a ballplayer, shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche Box
More props,
 R.I.P. my poor pops
Can't see his son shine like the Four Tops
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers, you'll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers, cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches, Nana to watch Grandma
In pajamas I snuck out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa, you gon' watch Santana

Now Lord you know, just how hard I try
To live my life and get it right
Trying to see some light or even better
Way over way a new day, someday
Yesterday was filled with sorrow but tomorrow
It gets better I know, tell you, I know

Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate, little fence - I climbed over
Little scrapes, little dents - I got over
That was just the beginning it's not over
It's been a long time comin' Cam
It's been a long time riding and a long time running, man
Shit done changed since The Wop and The Running Man
Since Nino, Gee Money, The Carter, and the Duh-Duh Man
It's no longer a New Jack City
It's ""cop fast and move that quickly"" or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I ain't talking rap, man, I'm coming up this road
I'm talking crack, man and coming up with O's
I'm coming up with halves and coming up with wholes
Shit got hectic had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go, I receive it move it and roll
I was comin' from the Q, Zeek was comin' from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smash in dough
We was all on the 
paper-run
Yeah, 
waiting for a change to come
Now look: the change has come
The 7-Pick Up, Yukon, the Range is come
The day has come, Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers
In this game, we remain, it's a shame cuz",https://genius.com/Camron-lord-you-know-lyrics

Hole throw you in it for a half a brick a blow
Rappin' and movin' is all you niggas know
Swear to God these niggas true fags, certified douche bags

Yeah, you don't know what that new Glock do
You don't know how to count chump, 2 times 2
You don't know what the grind is like or that new rock do
You don't know what it is to see that shoe box full
Chump, you don't know what that oo op do
Have your block like oo aa oo
Who shot who
Yea, I leave the gun there so the police think you shot you
I hop in a coupe and do my do
I pimp most of these bitches, really open these bitches
Ask about me, you thought really Tony was vicious
Man I'm that times 2
So please homey, cuff your bitch and let that guy through
Let that guy move
Let that guy go
Man that guy crazy
Let that guy know
Cat got rabies
Yeah MAC got 80
Shots that ready to pop and hatch like babies
I lock the block down
Like a jailhouse lockdown
Cops found, razors in the mattress
I let the 8 boop off at your face dude
Have you coming out the speakers like the base do
I'm a mothafuckin beast and animal
2003, the street's new Hannibal
Man I show you what the piece and hammer do
Raise my arm with the piece and hammer you
Let the 8 spread, off at your face head
Watch your face, head sorta like snake's head
I'm guerrilla, born lion hearted, ape bread
Zoo minded, eagle eyed, beetle side, snake head
And I play dead, just to fool you, just to move you
All that just to shoot you
Fall back, this shit is cuckoo

Cha ching, I'm in
Bling my rims I sing they spin
But my 2 nine M's, they the ying yang twins
Cus they Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, from the window to the wall
From the ceiling to the floor
With a feeling when you ball
Make your mom cling
I'm into don things
Don Dom, Donna Karan, Don Cornelius, Don King
But follow Jon Gotti, Joe Pesci, armed robbery
Hard body, body hard doggy fuck up your bodyguard
Dolly call us the shotty ma
Y'all call up the squally squaw
Prolly hard, get it all the squally in the party pa
Right in the Hammerstein
Gasoline, tear gas, pepper seed, tear fast
Knight sticks tear ass
Cuff ‘em and chief goes
Damn gun that he reach for
Hammer hit with the cheap blow
Man its nothing I eat those
Then I piss off my fowl, I lay for it
Car, Crib, credit, A 1 steak sauce
I'ma straight boss, great loft, great Porsche
Golf course, race horse, Aqueduct, Ray Soft
And I make one call to get the pussy poppin'
Call your girl, pop that pussy wanna pussy pop
And a hoochie split it, doogie hit it, booby hit it
Her booby want her back the coochie, play saluchi wit it
Booby at this thing, damn he all moody with it
She ain't all that in that car I say Suzuki civic
I make a movie with it just to get my point across
Dog hand cuffin' god damn join the force
Mommy, come join the boss
Stick your tongue out and
Toing a toing a toing on my dick till your voice get hoarse

Dead Motherfuckers,Purple Haze (Advance),2004,"Everybody out at the Roc the Mic tour

Locking ya nice doors
I pop in and light four with chickens that light gauze
They click if they like war
Fixing to fight for
Me look at my ice for sure ya sight's sore
We all wearing links
As I prepare a drink
Glare and think
How I got the whole New York wearing pink
Girls they stare and wink
How I flare the mink
Drop the top pop a throttle
Cock a Glock pop a bottle
Seen Paid in Full now I'm up in Blockbuster
And I'm paid in full still on the block buster
9 4 rock Rucker 01 rob Rucker
Shogun show guns blow one
You not gutter
Little inside joke for you cocksuckers
My block sucker
Popcorn and hot butter
Like it's the movie theater
But it's the uzi area
Whodie who called whodie who produce hysteria
And me I ain't no coat tail bitch
I be at the motel six
With them wholesale bricks

Better be love
I'm leaving depend it all
To get your love
Jump back
Glock cock
Aim shoot
Yall some dead motherfuckers

I do like Alfred though shit in ya car
Pop a squat in the drop
Take a drop in the drop
While you dropping the top
Unlocking ya locks
Damn last year y'all got a mask and y'all robbed
I imagine it's hard
Y'all asking for jobs
Realize I'm attached to the mob
Sellin' crack in the park
Blowin' sacks in the saab
The chrome give you skin burn
In ya dome like ring worms
And niggas coming home
They my interns
We the cake couple
Put together great puzzles
The hood ain't love us
The hood together we stay subtle
Juggle bubble
Why y'all niggas hate tussles
I ain't always hustle
I was mase muscle
He had the one so he bought the body
I had the gun so I caught the body
Done son off in the lobby
I stayed with the gun shooters
Jum movers
Razoo kahluah
Turn one ruler
To sun dueler
And the same brother that you knew
Came through in the Range same color as Yoo-Hoo
Now I know that's the same color as doo doo

And I got esses that's coo coo

All my nigga team fix the fix get the cream

Got the Crist' and the ghanga and its gettin un-karma
Comma, now she cryin she missin her mama
Just a steppin stone for me now I'm hittin Madonna
And she twistin the fauna as we sit in the sauna
Guess it's just my persona, got her kissin my condom

We're the Dips, so cut the shit

See your booty panties, ma shake somethin'
Shake somethin', shake somethin'
Shake-shake, shake shake somethin'

And I got some girls, bout five or six
And a five and six, about five or six

Let her drive the whip, see if she ride a stick
Who as live as this? My pool size is sick (sick)
But swim in my pants and dive for dick
They call me Moby, my pos-i-tive
Tell them free Willy if your thighs are thick
And your ass if fat and your head is right
And your dough is good, we can smash tonight
Right here in the car, ma, at the light
If you ask for cash, oh I'm mad for life
Kiss ass, you dyke, and I'm fast to fight
If you get mad, (??) grab a bite (what?)
Or I stab it light and we'll grab a bite
Is it crab you like? Lobster appetite

In front of the club, drops, coups and trucks
I'ma front in the club with a hundreds of studs
A gun and some bud through the metal detector
The metal detect ya, settle and wet 'cha
I don't mettle with extra, you fakes and clowns
I walk in and get out of the club safe and sound
Silencer, dog, how safe it sound?
I got apes and hounds, he just pace around
And I'll lace you down, but I'm lookin for
A Manhattan ho or a Brooklyn whore
A Bronx biatch that'll let me look and explore
Up front but beat around the bush for sure
'Til the tush is sore, hit it doggy style
Get it doggy style, you know your doggy's style
I'ma mack or more and it's smash or more
A VIP up between the bathroom stalls

We're the Dips, so cut the shit

Why I ain't got no money, if I'm moving weight?
Fucking with Jorge
Up on Broadway, had me in a hallway
Come on primo, I ain't got all day
This shit he called yay was white like the Aspens
I got home, that white was some Aspirin
Took the tenement despite what had happened
Beat up lieutenants, had fights with the captains
Over loot, I kept hammers on the roof
And word to grandma I was cute, with my bandana on the boot
I realized I wanted cameras on the coupe
And I couldn't get that jam, and standing on the stoop
This don't move me, money
This chicken wing, new kick, cab fare and movie money
What about my hair?
Don't think your boobies funny
But the rest is re-up
Next week should do me honey, 
next week?

Diamonds weighed a ton of it, and I didn’t pay for none of it
F all the jewelers, and whatever become of it
Fugazy, crazy, never bought from Donny
Just stole from Jacob and extorted Ivy
Gabriela's cousin got the fake stones
The kind you take home, come back with straight chrome
Or bats to break bones, you gon' be stretched
Macho from TS, said F the BS
In Miami almost hit ’em off with 3 lefts
Had to stop 'em, they was undercover detecs
But I be fresh, b-augettes, we 'fess

I'm the prince that sold Prince, 
Purple Rain
But I'm blasted up, V1, acid cut
Pink diamond, diamond backs, I ain't fat, bastard what
Pal pass it up, pay with plastic bucks
Still drink Clicqo out plastic cups
Pardon the Aston Martin, fast as fuck
The partin startin’ to smash the traffic up
And my furs apply, that’s hers and I
Yeah I'm eyein’ hers, yeah sir, curves and thighs
It's the birds and guys, that flip birds and pies
Any sizzurp wizzurp, word I'm fly

If I could I would give you the world (the world, it’s me ma)
But all I can do is just offer you my love (my, Killa...)

Yo, remember 'Best Out', they were the best out
A crew from Harlem, wasn't down, felt left out
They had coupes I wanted, on cruise they flaunted, taunted
Girls, jewels, tools, I knew what I wanted
Watched the homie shine, then was a lonely time
Boat ride, bus ride, can't go I'm only nine
Ten years later, I'm the one Sony signed
Ten mil' later, damn you watched your homie grind
'Cause I'm past chrome, got that pas-sion
Paprika hot tamale, salt and pepper sads on
For real I'm something else, steel is under belt
Let's go to the district, steal something else

Huh,?shorty?told me her?story, I ain't cast any aspersions?or hold judgement
So I told her a piece of mine

I was 14, just startin' a dream
All grandma wanted was a washing machine
Couldn't afford it, left me with a heart full of steam
Felt like coffee, let me borrow some cream
Hustlers said, ""You can't be part of the team"", why?
""You a ball player, one day you gon' make it out""
Yeah, I hear all that, but I ain't tryna wait it out
You givin' me the work or what, what the debate about?
They said no, so my options I had to weigh it out
Fuck the Daily News, I'ma find me a paper route
Got with the stick up kids, them niggas drove a Pontiac
Never met Martin, but could tell you where the Tommy at
Pass me the pump, that's no relation to Johnny, Jack
Gripped it like I'm gettin' in and out of that laundromat
Apologized to the couple I had to victimize
Week later, told nana, ""Look, I got a big surprise""
She was happy, but listen, she ain't no dumb-dumb
""Where the money for this washer and dryer come from?""
Won it playin' basketball, man, a lump sum
Gave her a kiss and a hug, that's where I come from

Why I feel like I'm losin' weight? (Weight)
Why I ain't got no money if I'm movin' weight? (Weight)
My life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a crib, a new estate (New estate)
Yeah, that's what I used to say (Used to say)
You can't get paid on an earth this big, you worthless kid
You know the rest, that's life, nigga (Life, nigga), huh
That's life, nigga (Life, nigga)

Yeah, huh
I had to get off the mob beat
I gave 'em up, but shit, it could be my streets
Be on boulevards, avenues, side streets
Where you get wet and on top is a dry sheet
R.I.P. Big L, he put me on his album
R.I.P. Bloodshed, y'all niggas knew the outcome
R.I.P. Reg White, my nigga was a falcon
Hud 6, I'm still lookin' up like ""How come?""
Can't forget Fat Mack and Shawn Q
Right now, I'd like to take a second, thank Don Pooh
He gave me money to write for Young Gavin
And I ain't have a deal, I was full time trappin'
I mean, no credentials, but he seen my potential
Thankin' the ones that help you get started, essential
I could've been outlined, chalked, a stencil
Now I got insurance, money for my dentals
So-called gangstas, you better move gentle
Kill you with the number 2 lead from my pencil
But everything's beautiful, me and money are mutual
Try to come between it, we'll quickly put you in neutral
Movin' pharmaceutical through the street, well, it's suitable
Dirt from 1997 still inside my cuticles
Nah, Killa, they ain't used to you
Slug, pretty thug, but I ain't here to get cute with you
We keep the instruments, nah, it ain't no musical
Dog food, you fuckin' with the Eukanuba crew
King shit, bling shit, already felt the crown
Me against you, bet that, double down
See I did the Midwest, NC I melted down
Back at Flex car show, I was sellin' pounds
We were, was that Charlotte? I don't know, but I'm heartless
Weavin' all the charges, I'ma eat regardless
A line from Paid in Full that wasn't in the script
Just how I was feelin', what you see is what you get
I mean look, the Godfather, your father, no Maury show
From 1-40th, I will let the forty go
Black and white like a Oreo, just how the story's told
Niggas suckin' dick on they knees at the glory hole
Vainglorious, I don't need the glory though
Nah, I don't need the glory though

Why I feel like I'm losin' weight? (Weight)
Why I ain't got no money if I'm movin' weight? (Weight)
My life's based upon what I'ma do today
Cop a crib, a new estate (New estate)

Was gon' take my ex back, seen her with Safaree (Psh)
Had her with the work in the car, that was my down bitch
But you joined the circus, you do clown shit
When you fuck up, can't come back around, this
Word from the late, great Hud, ""How I sound, sick?""
It might be old or some', but, look, I never spoke on it
Don't like it? My dick's available, choke on it
Talk when I wanna talk, no pressure from a Instagram

Like a virgin, shower curtain, somebody let Madonna know
Your girl jumped in and jumped off, I yelled ""Geronimo""
Still countin' money, dummy, that's why they on my—
Three million dollar retail, two mill from the online
Another one point five million dollars when it's tour grind
Eight-digit movie deal, yeah, it's Jason Bourne time

They?said?get there by?midnight, I'm way beyond twelve (Fuck?that)
I ain't comin', I'm jettin', Le'veon Bell
My baby mom, they ask why I leave the chick
She too good for me, I'm a piece of shit (Word)
I'm from these cold streets, phased, braised and gold teeth
Me and Monsta circlin' blocks lookin' for old beef (Have you seen her?)
Surrounded by graveyards and murals (Cemetaries)
I lost my nigga, plural
Bloodshed and Hud 6, my brain done went sterile (Crazy)
Plus investigation from the bureau (FBI)
But the truth told, my lawyer, man, he too cold
But they still snoopin' around lookin' for loopholes (Yeah)
What you tell 'em? I know the statute of limitations (Well, I do)
A trip to Mexico, tryna fight the temptation (Sheesh)
They want me back, in Juarez they waitin'
I look at the phone, debatin', please leave me alone, Satan

(Cartel want me out of retirement) All the hustlers rejoice (Rejoice)
Misunderstood females, I wanna hear your voice

I mean, it all seems necessary (What?)
For this money, by all means necessary (Yes sir)
If you messed up, it's very rare you get a pass
We the reasons bodegas doubled up on the plexiglass (That's what we did)
Why at midnight they lock the door, you gotta go
To the window, put your money in there when you spendin' cash (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
We the cause of that (Cause of that), and because of that (What?)
If you ever push play, I be causin' that
I ain't do football, in the streets I was quarterback (Hut)
Freekey Zekey Deion Sanders, see, he was my cornerback (Cornerback)
But I'm off of that (Off of that), I'm from a dust block
Where some of Wu-Tang used to come and place they orders at
Fistfights, shootouts, problems? Way short of that
If you had a problem, you'd be like, ""I need my daughter back"" (Please)
Doctors, insurance, nah, they can't afford all that
One day you'll be coughin', next week you in a coffin, Jack
A few blocks away from where the great Rich Porter sat (Location)
I wish I could say I was lyin', these all the facts (All the facts)
Facts on facts, I would unwrap my snacks
I ain't even have a prize in my Cracker Jack (Nope)
Now the cars are like Golden State 'cause we back-to-back (Back-to-back)
I'm from where the slogans began, ""Crack is wack"" (What else?)
""Just say no,"" ""This is your brain on drugs""
""Drug-free school zone,"" name same, just slugs

All the hustlers rejoice
Misunderstood females, I wanna hear your voice

Who ever thought Cam would grow to gross in the?millions?
101?West, you should've?seen my building
139 Park, started off?as children
Grew up with Big L and the dude supposedly killed him
A week before that though, Big L had tried to kill him
That's what I heard, please don't get in ya feelings
When the time's right I will tell you about these villains
And everybody dead, so it ain't about squealin'
Weapons we conceal 'em, need be, reveal 'em
Fly, nah, fly traps was hangin' from the ceiling
Milk and Giz was chillin', me and Biz was illin'
Love my hood but to make it out, woo, what a feeling
I couldn't sleep at night, in my bed I would keep a knife
Until I got a gun, where I'm from they ain't believe in life
Cops come readin' rights, but we ain't the readin' type
You don't need Adidas or a zebra, see my stripes
Goddamn, you got to feel me brother
On my block, best friends they kill each other
No slouch or homicide to vouch ya
How I was raised, think I give a fuck about ya?

Keep risin', keep risin' to the top (Yeah)
Keep, keep grindin', keep strivin' on the block, and
To my brothers that passed away, see you when we get up top
All of us, all of us, all of us
This is my city (This is my city, Harlem)

Uh, yo, Reggie White took me on my first stick up
15 years old, can't front I caught the hiccups
Told me calm down, then proceed to click up
Thought that car was a shirt the way we left that shit ripped up
8th Ave, dipped up, in my waist the grip tucked
Told me keep my lips shut I ever get picked up
I said before that you'll find me with my wrist cut
Just wanted to chill, now in this shit I'm mixed up
You know Max B, I call him Charlie Rambo
Lived in the same building, you would call a bando
Outside more gunshots than Commando
That's why I had to treat myself to Porsches, Lambos
Pardon, I get emotional
It's all real, none of it is promotional
Just wanted to play basketball and have an ocean view
But when you live where I live, what the fuck you supposed to do?
Fast forward, Fort Lee, New Jersey, my triplex
Son just born, formula by the Pyrex
Liquidated money, the drugs from them big checks
Been solidified way before Dipset
No disrespect to the brotherhood
They're my brothers, but brother I'm from another hood
Where it ain't fair, like Blair they leave you under wood
Old money go missin', shots where ya mother stood

Keep risin', keep risin' to the top (Yeah)
Keep keep grindin', keep strivin' on the block, and
To my brothers that passed away, see you when we get up top
All of us, all of us, all of us (This is my city, this is my city, Harlem)

Her?dream's in the sky, but her life is in the cellar
Public assistance was been supposed to help her
She said, ""Cam'ron, can't you hear me cryin'?""
I called section eight like, ""Get my homie out the shelter""
Gave her 50K, gave her a kiss, called her bella
Invest it wisely, don't turn into Cinderella
I don't wanna you say (Say), Can't you hear me cryin'?
Meanwhile, I'm in Margielas, I'm spinnin' like some propellers
And everybody is jealous because I'm flyer than Delta

Pulled the swammy out, *gun cocking, gunshot* (Killa)
And I was lyin', when? Come on, try again
Even the skit's real, cousin Bang did a five to ten
Could be on the beach, instead he's in the lion's den
He'll never say, ""Can't you hear me cryin'?"", yes

Drama, that's when the feds pull up to mama house
Turned her back, slammed the door, homie, what ya mama 'bout?
Sometime I got the shot, can't you hear me cryin'?
Brain started to shift when Rakim made Mahogany
When I decided I had a problem with poverty
Prophecy, thinkin' homicide, but still logically
Now, stars in the car, the ceilin' know astrology
I ain't have a dollar B, I'm lucky Toy acknowledged me
This around the time the Wu had me wearin' wallabes
Said, ""You the one Cam"", I said, ""Yeah, I gotta be""
Now I'm a father, B, can't you hear me cryin'?, y'all don't bother me
But I do this for the castaways, those movin' a pack a day
Don't gotta be a bag of yay' you could be shippin' hats away
If you ain't tryna get it, go that-a-way
That's why I had to say, can't you hear me cryin'? (Killa, killa)

Kilos and weed were thrown to me (What else?)
Mo Money from Philly
Packed it up fo' sho, got right on the road for me (What up Mo?)
I like to thank I-80 though (I-80, though?)
That interstate made me rich, boy (Rich, boy)
I had coke and weed
But then I threw some D on it way before Rich Boy (Dog food)
You can't deny the bypassin' (Yeah, ya girl)
I got a thing for them wide asses
She suck me off so good
I gave her $1400, go get new eyelashes (Diamond joints)
So, get out yo' feelings (Feelings)
That's how I'm feeling (I'm feeling)
'Cause it sure feel good to see chandeliers hangin' from 50 foot ceilings
H-h-hot girl summer
Uh, bitches got turnt (Yeah they did)
Few of y'all just a little too hot though, man
Couple my niggas got burnt
(Killa, Killa, Killa)

(Keep on pushin', oh yeah)
That's what my nana said (God bless her)
Turkey and cheese, a glass of milk for dinner
With a slice of banana bread (Wish they could reap the benefits right now)
She said, ""Keep on pushin'!"" (Okay), keep on pushin' (That's what she said)
Wanted me to finish college but, I like money, man, I just couldn't

I can't wait for my block to get it together, man
(I'm straight, I'm straight, I'm straight)
Story so fucking crazy, man
Wish the big homies would come together, man
Tell their story, man
I'll tell you a taste of what I know though

I, I-I had to beg the big homie Reg not to rob Steph Marbury (Never told you, Steph)
This the same year that he got drafted
I said, ""That's my man""
He say, ""He got that Rollie on and that's my shit
Tell him to leave or I'ma start snatching"" (Crazy)
""You got it, OG, I don't want no problems big or small"" (None at all)
I knew they was wilding when niggas robbed Biggie Smalls
These niggas cray-cray, I got to get away-way
Until then, I'ma spray anything moving if it's mayday (Facts)
Toughest in my hood, nah, but I am not for play-play (Nope)
On the East side, my niggas had hand grenades and AK's (Tough mob)
Plus nobody love me more, more than my nigga AJ (True)
And be in Grand projects anytime I'm on vacay (What up, Deebo)
I still will get masked up with the MAC tucked
Yeah, I'm back up with no backup
This cap bust, it's like getting hit by Mack trucks (Bow)
Slow money's for show money, but Harlem 'bout that fast buck
Pre-gentrified, only white I seen was bagged up, truth

These new hundred dollar bills, huh
How that look

I'm on 7th Ave with my karats on (Right)
Double park with my hazards on (Wassup?)
On the block, God bless the dead when my nigga Light had had the bomb (RIP)
Word bond, forty dealt before school start (It's a fact, nigga)
In a school zone and the teacher talkin' 'bout school smarts
From the same hood as  and Big Dave
Hoop dreams turn coupe dreams
And we sold crack where kids play (What else?)
Live on Lenox, fell dead in a vacant lot
His 16th at the  trying to make salat (As-salamu alaykum)
I was 15th and I had work tryna make a lot
Cooked it up at a fiend's house
All he wanted was to scrape the pot (True facts)
Rich nigga and I'm sittin' on crates still
Real, real nigga, got a bitch on 8th still

I'm a, I'm a, I'm a 12 street delegate, profitin' off every play
Men y'all look up to is not who I celebrate (Nah, nah)
I was raised by killers that rose Hell and pissed on Heaven gates
I was taught by robbers that robbed the robbers, but that's a separate case
In my present state, I'm getting money, I never press the brakes
Dude die, don't tell me that shit 'bout he in a better place
Move forward and elevate in the spirit of players that used to score
I remind him of Hen Dog when he pulled up in that Coupe before (That's me)
I remind him of Al Fierce, I might shoot right through the door
You remind me of Larry, he talked, facin' a two to four
Get nasty when these plays are running

The kilos I got off of Hamilton Terrace
Way before the Jeff Hamilton leathers
'Til I found out it was stepped on
Damn right, Cam had to test it
As much as I invested, niggas done stretched it
I mean, it was perico
But I'd rather have fishscale from México, huh, no brakes
'Cept snowflake, Cam had his own
I wash the money like Jammin' Jerome, she said, ""You arrogant""
Nah, I'm confident, that I condone
'Cause no man can be the man, he ain't a fan of his own
But where my ladies at? (Ow), With your fly asses? (Asses)
Sellin' hair weave, waist trainer, eyelashes (Get it, bitch)
You out here gettin' rich and you don't really give a shit
You said all them hoes could die, tell 'em pick a ditch
That's ice cold, baby got life goals
Her lips, you could wrap around a lightpole, oh my
If you roll right, you'll end up on the right road
Suede seat, mink rug, dashboard white gold (White gold)
Whatever you want, I'm gon' get it to you
She looked at me and said (I'm gonna give it to you)
Ah, opened my pants and said (Keep risin' to the top)
Ah, ah, yeah, shake it, baby (Keep risin' to the top)
I'm gon' give it to you

I was trappin' in that cold spot

Yeah, I was
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, man? (Shake it)
You know that hate like luggage, baby
That's why I carry on, nigga, get it?
That's why I think things should go my way
I was driving on that highway

Was gettin' to that bag for you, boo
I wasn't? Huh
That's a fact, man
I know sex ain't the answer
It's the question, ""Yes,"" should be the answer, huh
You know when you with me, clocks exist, time doesn't

In our park is murderers, drug dealers and card sharks (I had to get it, baby)
Jealousy and hate, can't debate it, it played a large part
Niggas'll lay underneath the same place your car's parked (I had to get it, baby)
In broad day, let's not talk about when it got dark
Told you watch ya mouth, you played dumb before you got smart

Losin’ Weight,S.D.E. (Sports Drugs and Entertainment),2000,"Why I feel like I'm losing weight?
Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?
My life depend on what I'ma do today
Why I can't move away
Just loot and me, without the scrutiny?
Niggas screwing me; 2 and 3 truancies
4 shots, 1 toolie, G.. 1 eulogy
My mother and girl is smothered in pearls
When a nigga under the world, uh

When I was 11 got the toolie thick
My uncle pulled me to the side
And he schooled me quick, told me some gooey shit
You can't get paid in an earth this big?
You worthless kid, nigga don't deserve to live
Go and get it motherfucker, if you murder kids
Bottle up carbohydrates and preservatives
He got hit up that same night
But ever since my dough, my flow, and my ho game been tight
Puns of pearls, yo tongue will twirl, looka here
Booger bear, I'll have you up in hooker gear, I swear
I was doing, Lex pursuing, niggas be wired like Western Union
Short like next to Ewing, head for truant, only set was ruined
Phony checks was fluent, listen hear me out
I'm from a cocaine block, with some plain clothes cops
And the sun don't rise, but the rain don't stop
The pain don't stop, but my brain don't stop
Ain't no lockouts, the game don't stop
Every month you change yo' locks, change yo' spot
Get a little smart, want to change yo' tops
Rearrange yo rocks you got a gang of friends, money
You got Ben's arranged money, have a Benz or Range money
But if I get knocked, I ain't got no bail
But I come on the weekends, Pablo jail
See I came a long way, that's living the wrong way
That's sniffing the po-na, that's sipping the cog-na, hey
You wanna be a star, you have ya own day
Where they play ball, drink and get a buzz
Reminiscing, what a good kid he was
I don't know what happened, all he did is what he loved
That's when you opposing me, Killa get the rosary
Fuck this rap shit, I die for mine, motherfucker

Why I ain't got no money if I'm moving weight?

Why I can't move away
Just loot and me, without the scrutiny?

When a nigga under the world

Gather around y'all, it's going down y'all
Murder rap, clown niggas back down no
Straight like that, y'all niggas fuck around yo
Bandana P, blow thirds, the fourth take you up off
This thug shit, I keep a beamed out fifth
Is you fiend out now, nigga? Catch a clean bullet
I live the street life, ya heard? Guns, money and birds
Get dead armed and dead on your jewels and pearls
Where I was placed, talking the wrong style thun
Capital P, y'all know what's the outcome
Could 'bout some but rather pull out the stout guns
Don't let ya mouth get you in some shit ya legs run from
For all the killers and the 100 dollar hoes
For real bitches check me out though
We be the most ill, more drama than Denzel
More liver than the park fights at Sunny Carson
Me and Killa Cam, live at the Carbon
It's crazy, bitches throwing they pussy
Niggas flash razors, you crazy

I'm not going to watch this go on any longer
You put my food in the dark
And expect me to look for my plate on some Mr. Magoo shit
Fuck I look like
I'm not going to watch this go on any longer
WHOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'm on ya'll
Harlem, who else is going to hold us down
Bloodshed niggas
Lets get it right this time
Understand
Killa

Yo, I don't understand how these cats sip daiquiris
Like it's all good down at the hit factory
Be on 54th, whole clique backing me
All that click clackery takes your wrist wrappery
I ain't no rapper, b, I skeet Uzis
And I can't act, turned down 3 movies
So gimme your chain, your jewels and your cash
And your fast food, I'll eat your food fast
My rude ass, carries 3 weapons
And I'll give your face a c-section and keep stepping
Who else in a hurry to mirk
We kill girls, rape em', bury their skirts
Imagine me wake up 7:30 for work (what?!)
I'd rather run the streets in a 730 with work
But met this knucklehead, thought he want a order
Came and asked me stop pitching to his daughter
Y'Serious? This man can't be
Be glad I'm not in her damn panties
Got a damn handy
How you going to ever ask stop carrying candy
I'm going to sell to anybody in your damn family
Your Uncle Tom, your Aunt Tammy, your Grandmammy
Your right hand man Randy, understand me
In Atlanta I got an outlandish land piece and a matching land
Desert-colored: Sandy

You know the one with the whips, THATS ME
The one with the chips and the chips, THATS ME
The one with the toast, pants baggy, yelling out get at me
Get at me, nigga, THATS ME
The one that be running and dodging, YOU
The one that be sucking mad dick, YOU
The one that's scared of some yay yo
Always wanna lay low, cause your girl say so, YOU, biatch

I could show you some ice
Throw you advice
You not that good dog, who told you you're nice
Ay, yo your crew, switch siders
When I come through, hey Cam
Dick riders
But I only mess with Navigators 528
6 drivers, big buyers, where you live we live liver
Come through, stick your suppliers
Mack so many hoes, dick in saliva
Gash her up, ma, put it on you mouth
Then I grab her neck and try to take her tonsils out
And I don't got beef, I don't play those games
If I did though believe me I would say y'all names
Go to your house, red dot scope your crib
Smack your earth, snatch your seeds, choke your wiz
My crew split it was my mistake
But to my nigga Duke we all make mistakes
I'm going to get shit right if I spend my cake
Jimmy, I'm a get you up out of 5h
This is for my niggas that load the pipe
Saying I'm the best just not promoted right
You know my life
Drink, smoke, roll some dice
Control the hiest
Know I'm a patrol your schiest
We all get schiest
Ma, keep all your rice
Wedding ring, HELL NO
I like all my ice
Niggas tried to make Killa Cam all polite
Turn on the set now bitch I'm like poltergiest
You the type talk about everything you got now
I interupt you like ""Not now you hot owl""
My rings like a dog, all rock wild
When I flash it, everybody shocked ""wow!""
I see y'all concerned about me
You don't got to go to school to learn about me

Yo, the one with mad guns, THATS ME
The one with the yay for 23, THATS ME
The one with the ice, sliced, coke half price
Yoke that's nice, THATS ME
The one that's scared of a scuffle, YOU
The one that say ""Baby girl, I love you,"" YOU
The one that talk about hustling, never seen a oven
You all about nothing, YOU Biatch

Sports Drugs Entertainment,S.D.E. (Sports Drugs and Entertainment),2000,"Uh-huh, yeah

This goes to all my hustlers, entertainers
And of course, athletes in the struggle, trying to make a little hustle

Some get a little, some get none
Shit, I was part of the some get none
The ball, run for run, play the slums for crumbs
Wired, real tired, till my lungs are done
After all, I was nice in ball
But I'd come to practice weed-scented
Report card like the speed limit, 55-55 expellable
If you're nice they make sure that you eligible
Pretty final, '92 played the city finals
Pretty swift, real MVP, and 55th, I can hoop, yo
All-American in my age group, yo
Grades bad, settled for a JuCo
Uh, but why they let a thug on campus
All I did was rob and mug on campus
Sliced, rolled dice, got shiest on campus
At the toast got bad, payed the price on campus
Forgot about ball, I was done dude
Now I'm in county in an orange jumpsuit, middle of Texas
Call moms, she don't want the phone act
She don't condone and, Cam don't come home, shit

Cause the streets is a short stop
Either you slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Cause the streets is a short stop
Either you slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Cause the streets is a short stop
Either you slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Cause the streets is a short stop
Either you slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot

Yo, yo, ayo, coming back home, I thought it'd be cool
But everybody like, ""Cam, yo I thought you're in school""
""Nah, I'm about to go back"", huh, know that I'm lyin'
See me on Broadway, know what I'm buyin'
Niggas gettin' money, know what I'm eyin'
Shiesty again, nowhere without iron
Seems like my school life self-destroyed
Fuck gettin' a job bitch, self-employed
Slugs pop, drug spot, runnin' the thing
Played ball on the weekend, 300 a game
Till one of the workers pulled a small case
Mouth running like a dog race, trying to get us all laced
I was slingin', but wasn't the kingpin
I slow cased 'em, verdict: probation
Tried to fuck my P.O., she ignored that
Said, ""know what Cam? Get found with more crack, see what happen"", stopped the crackin', start rappin', quit the clappin'


Yo, yo, as a young nigga, always into crime
But no matter what, yo, always used to rhyme
So in that I became more curious
Fuck being up north delirious, more serious
Uh, so Killa did mixtapes
CEOs heard, now here come big cake
But one cat said Cam you better recoup
Before you back on your block, baby, dead on the stoop
But Un hooked me up with all this cheddar and loot
The best rap deal of all time next to Snoop
Money more to clutch, money more to touch
I don't just rhyme I own liquor stores and such, but yeah
Yo, the rap game remind me of the crack game
Niggas wanna get they gun, then start the clap game
For dat fame, roll with Untertainment
Sport, drugs, entertainment, till the arraignment

I'm from where niggas get they weight up in front of they house
Cop coke strap it to the waist of they spouse
I don't think I'll ever know what all this hatin about
Got a deal I don't know what perpetrating about
Got big guns dog, one pop and you out
Love women that suck and keep the nut in they mouth
While I lean back geeking how she loving my house
Let me tell you three things that the Dutch is about
'Cuzzi bubbles, grands, slow dick in yo mouth
And when u hear that (moan) he kicking you out
Hell naw I'm ain't no hater that's just what I'm about

Ayo
They wanna flip me
Bounce me
Half and quarter ounce me
Try to speak my name out loud and mispronounce me
Hit me four five rubber grip me
Them hoes love me in a five but the dealer trying to six me
Dimes wanna twist me
Nah you can't kiss me
Go 'head with the mo' at the bar
You better Cris me
Baby blue 528 doing sixty
Cuttin' swiftly
Duckin' fifty
Hit my ho crib for a nice dick suck and a quicky
Killa Cam, Dutch, and the Spade flow sickly
The streets shifty
So I keep my tool
If yo ass wanna live you better keep your cool
Motherfucker

Yo, Yo
Yo where I'm from they let the cartridge blast
Everybody smart in math
Loan sharks with cash
Running from the narks and task
Streets arts and craft
Come on I start to laugh
Cause I almost caught the case with Rich Parker ass
Now a nigga paid out
Suede couch
I'm into hooded things
Bitch butt be way out
These cats be Heathcliff
When I come around they play mouse
Mickey and Minnie
Jerry from Tom
Heavy in arms
In front of Bamm-Bamm
Hanna-Barbera lover
Collar big
Cotton candy blue gators polishment
Y'all in astonishment looking for acknowledgment
Money, pour it on 'em
Meet a snitch throw water on em
Any repercussions make sure my seeds bubble
If you ain't hear me on clue I said I see double
Guns double tecks
Hoes double sex
Accountant handle my money but I double check
Bubble Lex
Ain't too much more I care about
Liquor store and the Bronx old warehouse
Clear it out
L's with my liquor
Silencer a helluva whisper
Gas-ing up a ho tell her you miss her
Dealing with the old timers was a helluva listener
Business sale a few differ
Nigga pelican slippers
Mommy is senseless
Get my moola I'm conscientious
Tell Mira to buy me Benzes
Por favor
Harlem mamma poor
We fell off but back on nigga time to ball
Hun45th and Lennox
3 piece suit, bean pies, the Final Call
Gun up in the spinal cord
I got no time for y'all
We 8 digits you play frigate
Killa don't cook he blaze biscuits
Around us straight midgets
Jewels we keep frozen
Y'all keep dozing
The wolf in sheeps clothes
Streets buzzing V dozen
Bitches calling me husband
Saying we fuck when we wasn't
Lying on her coochie
I'm dyin for a hoochie
With an iron for a boobie
Casino style diamonds in the doobie
But Killa keep running to the timing of a groupie
But need work
Plate of a kind
If ya dope ain't 8 or a 9
Don't waste up my time
You racing for shine
Only way you be around motherfucking paper boy
If you quit your job and go be a paper boy
Cars swoop buck fifty
Gun shoot buck fifty
Bare facts buck fifty
Air Max buck fifty
Only New York nigga to fuck Whitney
On her period blood sticky
Same night plugged Misty
Play Toronto like Doug Christy
Fuck Christy
Louie the 13
Slugs with me
Gimme head
Yo quiero chichar
Blood to my head
But my day is Friday
Toast for my bread

Made a lot of enemies (true)
Would I do this shit all over again, I dunno
That's a good question, (You right about that) would you do your life over again?
I know I fuck fat ass Tasha one more time if I have nothing else to do
I fuck that bitch one more time, that ass was fat

Yo, shorty get a desk and chair
Now let the guest appear
But if you knew my life you'd shed a tear where
From the fucked up scar to the tough luck bar
To my cousin's final chapters in a crushed up car
A hero I be from the plural IVs
Capisce a few cats tried to muralize me (for what)
Cause I drive a fresh Benz and collect ends
But I lost brothers and best friends
Word life, we all brethren
But we don't speak and ain't nobody budgin
Cause we all stubborn
Yeah, we let the hate rise
Give each other fake fives
Look back peripheral give each other snake eyes
True in all sequels (true)
You too of all people
Guess they right money is the root of all evil
A nigga front on them though I trigger the M
I don't know guess it's just the type of nigga I am
I live my life a thug
Live my life with drugs
Fuck everybody else, I live my life for Blood
So Lexus,  and I got keep trees near

One of my worst fears, is being stuffed in a hearse
Six feet deep getting crushed by the dirt
Bury me with rings so when I'm plucked from the earth
Every mothafucka see how much it was worth (we makin money)
I see y'all discussing my best misjudging of my worst
And all my life put in nothin but work
Don't talk about how I was such a big flirt
I never slowed down cause I was fuckin with skirts
I mean since the early days I was cuttin from church
Y'all talk about things I've done to my life
You talk about things that I've done to my wife
I know where I'm going second coming of Christ
I do this for my niggas, who never get no cheddar
For my niggas upstate, that'll never get a letter
For my vitally sick, that would never get no better
For my niggas in the cold, that would never get a sweater
For the life I lead, things I done
A nigga went to school I had to bring my gun
A nigga had to hustle I had to sling them jumbs (I feel you man)
As the man of the house I had to bring income

All them dimes we sung
All those crimes we've done
All those times was fun
But would you do it again?
All them dimes we sung
All those crimes we've done
All those times was fun
But would you do it again?

Yo, this life I should rock again? (huh)
Stand on this mothafuckin block again?
Almost get shot again (it was tough out there yo)
See alotta men get shot up bad
Back up hobblin sister out gossipin (get em' to the hospital)
So I don't rhyme for executives
It's imperative do it for my jail bird consecutive
Get my messages, hell no
On my block nigga never live, one room 7 kid
Screamin mother overhead, no one fed
Two plates, one fork sour milk and a loaf of bread
But I shook it off smiled of course kid
My girl wild out on some child support shit
Out exhausted obsolete y'all (y'all)
But girls will flip like Dominique Dawes
I'm not here to teach y'all, just here to reach y'all
If I do my life over, I'd repeat all

You souped up, think I'm easy to touch
Then you been watchin' a little bit of TV, too much
Lots of rhymes, so you see my ass lots of times
On the corner still, like I ain't got a dime
Autographs not the kind to be signing the crap
Here's a CD, slash here's a dime of that crack

Nigga double up, keep all guns double clutch
Shoot at yo feet, make you jump like double dutch
New York baby for you matchbox niggas
Chicken wing, french fry, snack box niggas

I know looking at my jewelry is scarring yo brain
Not to mention Jada Pinkett over parking the range
(Yo that's Will Smith girl) naw she's part of my chain
Pardon my game, car gettin washed in the rain
Runnin yo trap, that'll get you one in yo back
The hood that I had, had to take the good with the bad
Like Joe on the run, plus his fuckin P.O. it's done
Low on his funds, had to get the coke or the guns
Word to the wise, killa Cam, I heard of them guys
Diplomat, crisp black, yo convertible fives
Rims on the wheel, to drive down shows in the South
Rap ain't that great neither, I got coke to give out
Stroke to give out, motherfuckin smoke to give out
Hoes to give out, naw we ain't over this route
Back on the street, Jimmy get the crack on the street
Tour over motherfucker let's get back on our feet


I fucked up let the streets got a hold of me
Now they got me trapped in and they holdin me
I'm stressed out, why else would I smoke the weed
Everyday papi tell me he got coke for cheap
Broke as shit, thats why I hold the fifth
Send niggas to snatch your chain and choke your bitch
Rope your nigga, leave you with an open liver
I'm the reason why its gonna get cold this winter
I done seen niggas standin on these blocks for days
Pump work out of buildings, dimes and treys
Fuck A&R's that want me to dance and pose
I rather stand on poles with grams and o's
White shirt, construction timbs, a pair Girbaud's
And white powder shit, that'll clear ya nose, faggot",https://genius.com/Camron-double-up-lyrics

Pissy drunk up in here, brought in gin to court
It's like a biscuit, judging my dick though, case acquitted
For this dough I'll do whatever it takes to get it
So, chain danglers, are in danger
When I skate with your ice like the Rangers, assume later
Boss bitch though, goin out like Tomb Raider
Booth razors, a few blazers, who raised him
He speak Eboni-, me and my goddaughter C-Hanni
Come through with the mean Tommy, ask you if you seen mommy
And she three feet behind me
Why my whole life is like the repeat of Gahndi

Fuck with me, I make you somebody bitch

But a chicken you could have out, pitchin 'em raw
Cuz she listen, been through it, did it before
But you gotta watch 'em close cuz they blab they mouth
Never punch 'em in they face just slap they mouth
Then fuck her til she cluck her whole basket out
Send her home wit her ass ripped out, and her back hurtin'
She wanna act like she don't know why her back hurtin'
Cab fare no, hope your train pass workin'
Hope you got a metro card or a token
They all love sayin if you lickin you stickin

Just get down, gimme some type of brains
And I'm never gonna have no damn wife to claim

It's a shame how y'all chicks admire the jewels
Niggas wearin white gold y'all inspired them fools

Why when I’m starvin I got to gobble meals
Why did I cop the steel
Why did I rob Rob for real
Why we can’t wait til our time God could take her
Why the flesh eatin disease make niggas get ate up
Why bitches with a fat ass gotta wear A cup
Why David Stern fuckin the NBA up
Why the great ones always break up
And when travesty happen they wanna make up
Why niggas can’t get caked up and stay caked up
Say what why we can’t tell who’s smart or dumb
Why niggas in blue suits can take us and put us in a orange one
Why Adam and Eve didn’t know what was in the garden dun
Why niggas from America always wanna car thats foreign dun
Why drugs I gotta buy why slugs gotta fly why thugs gotta cry
Why when I get on Blood got to die
Why me and Tai can’t see eye to eye
Why when plane crashes niggas fly to die
Why your word depend on a handshake when you reachin a palm
Why beef with my mom why can’t sleep without Cron
Why on my block I love every fight, why I laughed when they mugged Mary Wright
Why I got to fuck every night
Why Im deep in my ways Why we six feet deep in our graves
Why periods last three to five days
Why we ain’t retrieve the slaves
Why we don’t learn til we leave for the cage
And they say the beasts isnt raised
Why I can’t tell you the whole story just a piece of the page
Whys no such thing as true lies
Why can’t I have two rather a few highs
Whys homos guys that do guys in the world
Why ain’t more girls that wanna do girls
Whys multiple-sclorosis why got multiple of toasters
You know my .45 my .357 but why my shotgun why plot dun
Why man in statue depend on his rocks son
Why my hood fight urges why I seen crook type murders
And niggas get cooked like burgers

Why she rub it against her mouth like it’s chap stick
Why this rap shit
Why CEOs wanna rap why rappers wanna be CEOs
Yo why you dont wanna see me blow
Why the rhetoric why I can’t get my proper etiquette

Better get all your money motherfucker get that said again
I want that money too nigga
Fuck that lil two dollar prude
I wanna get that Cristal shit too nigga
Yeah niggas up in the shit motherfucker

Chosen One Freestyle,Team Invasion Presents: Best of Dipset,UnKnown,"You really think I wanna fucking sit here and rap?
When there’s cars to be copped
Chicks to be slapped
Wrists to be wrapped
Grip to be stacked
Guns to be cocked
Clicks to be clacked
Girls like me better in Prada
Like me better in nada
Hermes, Gucci exclusively
Know my hoochie coochie is used to me
Oh man I'm with you used to see
When I wild out they say they see their youth in me
They don't wanna see this damn 100 proof in me
100 guns, 100 knives the proof is me
Midnight, pick fight come on a roof with me
A lot of girls say ""Cam you look cute to me""
They just wanna get used to cheese, used to V's
If they wanna sex go do for me",https://genius.com/Camron-chosen-one-freestyle-lyrics
It’s Killa,The Program,2017,"Killa...
You know I can talk about what I wanna talk about
Them statute of limitations is up for them drugs
Far as them murders, I never knew nuttin' anyway, haha
I was sleep, haha yo

Yo, '97 huh, drugs I moved a big amount
Chick in my crib, her ribs I'm 'bout to dig it out
Then Ma$e called, said ""Yo, I'm stuck inside some bitch's house""
Her boyfriend at the door, could I hurry up and get him out
Aight, what's the address? Homie said ""Kingsbridge""
That was great I had some niggas right on Bainbridge
Yeah, we play but believe it ain't no game kid
Hopped off the elevator, aimed it at that lame lid
I ain't give a damn, yeah Cam I was gung-ho
Got this nigga home and he passed me a hundo ($100 dollars?!)
Told him straight up I ain't feeling him
Let me curve this nigga 'fore I end up killing him
I would make 80k on a lazy day
Then I watched him play Pop Lotti against Baby Maine
At this time I'm moving heroin in Maryland
They both died and this nigga turned reverand!
Had the hood hot, FBI agents 'round
We need a referee, shit, that shit a flagrant foul
Fuck it, kept it moving with my true manoeuvres
On the highway nigga moving that Eukanuba

When them drum fly, when them drum fly
Make your son cry, say hi to the bad guy
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker, that's Killa, motherfucker, that's Killa
From your tour dates, from your tour dates
To your court case, dressed in the North Face
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker that's Killa, motherfucker that's Killa

Yeah, I smoke pounds you clown, homie, you heard the bluff
All your murder stuff, man I heard enough
NFL murderers, you heard of us
This when Herb McGruff used to serve the dust
Task force, homicide, DT's and other NARCs
My jewelry, well that's frozen like my mother's heart
Bless her heart lord, me I'm some other shark
But the way I get money that's another art
Where should a brother start? How I used to pump in parks
Or how I parked niggas on the side of the barber shop?
Give me some Skittles, beast mode, I'm hard to stop
My life's cement, not wood, so it's hard to knock
Niggas get knocked off get knocked, the bill paid
From that 212, two-twelving with that 12 gauge
God's child, you owe me money? See hell's raised
You got two weeks and my two weeks is twelve days

When them drum fly, when them drum fly
Make your son cry, say hi to the bad guy
Nigga, that's Killa, nigga, that's Killa
Motherfucker, that's Killa, motherfucker, that's Killa
From your tour dates, from your tour dates
To your court case, dressed in the North Face

Lean,The Program,2017,"I'ma warn ya
In your circle don't mean that they in your corner
Almost was a goner, 10 years for marijuana
Only thing I ever said in court
""I plead the fifth,"" ""Hell no,"" and ""No, your honor""
So the streets honor me, humble, believe I'm on it
I grab my momma, I'm headed to a different genre
They couldn't understand me, now I find it ironic
I grew up with Big L, all I knew was ebonics
Jealousy, crack, greed, homicide and chronic
Where niggas catch a body, changed their name like the Sonics
It was hot like Phoenix
I used to look up at the Lennox Ave sign hold my heart and pledge allegiance
Drama 15 years straight, nothing recent
But I'ma call the state for back pay, they owe me grievance
And you can't knock that, block the block with the top that
Open up that Fanta, I got that

Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For It won't be long, til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on

Lowlifes with no knives, niggas is cutting throats
For that white like Tommy and green paper with the ghosts
That's power, I play my post, one day
You're the best thing since sliced bread, the next day you're toast
I can never be toast, hell no
I get money in lump sums, yea, I like my bread by the loaf
I like head by the coast, as I stare at the pacific
She asked if I liked it, ""Keep going girl, you're terrific""
Yeah baby, see I'm Clyde and I'm looking for a Bonnie, mami
To get a Gucci ghost, watch rings from Avianne
I share my wealth, humble beginnings, hunger strangled us
Pops had a choice, me or drugs, he chose angel dust (damn)
And the mother, some was living more dangerous
Tax season, the only time they was claiming us
Picture it like Kodak, this bracelet you could hold that
If I'm needed, know that you can

Lean on me, when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For It won't be long, til im gonna need
Somebody to lean on",https://genius.com/Camron-lean-lyrics

I can't help it that I look good
Smell good

Can dance all night long
It's America
If I want to wear a Rolex watch
You haven't got one, you understand?
Ha ha ha ha!!!!!

In my car I had two girls
A quarter mill, pill poppers and pistols, y'all
Bounce they will round, got 'em back from 'frisco, yall
Lost a package, hit a wall, got it back, I'm sitting tall
Maybe that's the reason that my wrist look like a disco ball
Who want to dance, man? Let's take it to the disco, y'all
Remember I ain't write for a year straight, I drink Cisco, y'all
This when I was 17, basketball, hollow tips
Hollow tips came first so of course
A nigga ain't got that scholarship
Fuck it
I ain't cared, never cared, not one for politics
King of Harlem took me on that path, please acknowledge it
Towers fell, power gained, still let the sour form
I ain't talking makeup when niggas was in that powder room
A lot of (nasal inhale), fiends coughing up mucus
Give me mine, hurry up, clean that up, I'm still the cutest
Baby 23 she on me like, Killa, you still the cutest
Then she got naked, Honey, so you's a nudist
Still move heroin, 3 piece suit with the Rollie on
Stamps stay fresh, should have named this the Pokemon
That's how fiends was acting, like niggas was looking for Pokemon
Me, I made a left, to get it right, I know I'm wrong
What's going on? Still flowing strong
Niggas struggling, oh, they just holding on (who are you?)
I'm Aaron Rodgers turn around, I'm going long
My dick the car, on your knees, blow the horn
This the winter, spring too, summer, fall
I'm D.I.A, What's that?
Done It All
Baby turn around, yeah, you the one I called
Her friend said, ""What you want?"", I looked and said, ""None of y'all""
Gold bottling, hoes hollering
Funky fresh in the flesh, 
Dave Koresh Cult following
A King Solomon, look at him, not a thing bothers him
On the corner, chicken wing, gobbling
I'm here to dismiss the myth of Ghosts and Goblins
We will leave you ghost from the toast
Oh not again
Snatch your siblings up, I'm really on it
The rap game be mine, I really want it
I stack hundreds, sit back blunted, this cat's done it
I taught bitches how to ball like Pat Summitt
The heroin, it flew in first class
To bag it up, you need scrubs and a nurse mask
Yeah boy, you looking at a dirt bag
50 keys in the tub, that's a real bird bath
Shit, all you mother fucking purse snatchers
Till you seen me, you never heard the word swagger
Nope you never heard the word swagger
Shout out to Dan man but I define the word dapper
(Who you)
Dapper Cam
No clothes on, got a prodigy
Stab your brain with your nose bone
Shit, got that line from 
The Infamous
Black Trump though, look at my apprentices
Shit, tryna finish all my sentences
I called my niggas up and we can start the senselessness
I'm a chemist
Put tools in your mouth, no dentists
Society yeah they know me
No movie, a true menace
Lieutenant hit off the tenants
Some tenants right off of Atlantic
Forgot that they owed us money

Killa!
HELLO!
Rip Murph!

Talking to lead, I'm one of the last few
Had to get my respect, it was past due
Through with my past, I just reminisce when I pass through
Movin' them bags, tryin' to get 'em flipped 'til my stash grew
Shooters that blast over the nonsense when the cash blue
Ask who? He was there when nobody actually cared
Real shit, had to share his kicks for half of the year
And now I take mine and I take his daughter shopping
Same nigga pull up to your door with the .40 knockin'
I got niggas quarter coppin', coke in the water, lockin'
All they ever knew was hustle, cause they never saw an option
I'm hearin' the sneak dissin', I'm tryin' to ignore the gossip
Third tape better be an earthquake before I drop it
I hear the hoes ponderin', I got a cult followin'
Joe Carroll, I throw arrows into your soul hollerin'
I probably not the most known but I'm the most confident
The most relatable, no debatable, most dominant
I'm in need of a blessin', I'm blowin' weed to the heavens
Cause in my dream I was destined to see me speedin' in 7s
When you look in the mirror, nigga, and see your reflection
Is you really or not? That's the easiest question
I'm around OG's, that was sellin' keys out the Westin
Never leave ya protection, and never speak off confessions
Y'all niggas getting lost, when they only need a direction
Feel it when you look at his momma face, and see the aggression

I'm done with that though
I ain't beefin' with the family man
Shit I'm still in the PJ's like candy man
With dudes sellin' whole halves of candy yams
Despite that the garage look like Candy Land
Candy painted, ain't nothin' about me tainted
Drove every car, you name it, look homie, come get acquainted
Can't change it or rearrange it, disclaimer because I'm heinous
The 9 will make you famous, blaow! That's for the plaintiff
The gun range no goggles, the targets they testin' nozzles
The bullets they on point, them points you call hollows
In the club we get the bottles, we leave it we hit the throttle
Then pull up inside McDonald's with porn stars and models
Look nigga you can't erase me
Debate me, rape me, I'm Spacey
These bitches, they want my baby, nah baby, but you can taste me
The guns got no safety, in DC, for when they grazed me
And I ain't been postin' lately, y'all would really hate me
Yeah homie, it's a blessin', I'm here to answer the questions
I'm the OG Don Q was talkin' 'bout at the Westin

What he do next? Check into the crazy house?

Besides that, man, you Yeezy with the Yeezy's
Be yourself, you ain't gotta go AWOL
And fuck that 'Ye, I been this way since yay tall
If you regret it then dead but if you said it, you said it
You meant what you said, can't tell me forgive and forget it
I'm different, I'm from a different type of hunger nigga
Ask OG Juan how I was when I was younger nigga
Shout to Fat Mike, Dave and Rock and they brother Mel
 just some east side niggas, I know they wouldn't tell
But peep the details, it's me, weed and females
Two to be exact, I met 'em doing some retail
Chanel bags, both had on the Adidas with the sea shells
Asked what they do, boo said ""Real estate and weed sales""

But them 

 been in your head though a year and a half
Let's get it right, go to the mall and tear up some tags
Then to my car, open my pants, clear up your tab
Fake hustlers understand why they mad at me
Why? Twenty year run started off with a half of P
Then I got a ki of D from the faculty
Bouffers that was bouffin'
Strong bladders, they never had to pee
And that ain't half of it, kilo's all in grandma's cabinet
Around the time M.O.P. was yappin' shit
You getting money say word, that ain't accurate
No promo, but no homo, I ain't jacking it, nigga

When death was looking in
My mom was doing hard
Grandma Dot took me in
Argued with Grampa Jerry
Scheme with Uncle Teddy
Ain't fuck with Cousin Joe, he was too petty
Thanks to Dave & Rock, that was nice of y'all
They wouldn't give me work (Why ?) 'cause I was nice in ball
This was the 9th grade
Working out with barbells
Then me and Hud bought  50 grams
Thought we was a cartel
What was we smuggling, I was struggling
Rapping, playing ball, plus hustling
Digga did tracks for me
Big L rapped with me
AJ held the guns, he'll still clap for me
Shout to Chasity, her sister Daphony
They drove across the bridge for us, yes the Tappan Zee (yes)
Let me speed up the story of pain and agony
Finally got a deal, more like a tragedy
Good looking Lance Rivera
Jacob for backing me
But I get money on these streets man, factually
Actually, Dominican Rich just gave some smack to me
And I had coke already, came up with a strategy
Kept it at Kim crib, the stove locked it up
Fat Shawn rocked it up, Duke the God chopped it up
Stash box in the car, hit the button stock it up
I was wilding man, and got up with the Taliban
Luca Brasi, introduced me to 
After that it was a wrap had Ohio on tilt
In Chicago, yo, I'm ballin' I felt like I'm Wilt
And that's the truth of how the funding for Dipset was built
Why they give me these odds?
This goddamn city of ours, the city of God
Still I drove off in the prettiest cars
Some was unfortunate, pine box or orphanage
Watching your siblings turning into foster kids

Shed a motherfuckin’ tear here right now, man. You wasn’t there. You wasn’t there. , you was there. Aye yo,  you was there. , you was there. What up, . That little two-bedroom in Ohio.

Could you plug me in with your friend with the freckles?
I mean, she look special
C-cup, cute face, ass disrespectful
Oh now I'm disrespectful, well check the bezel
Disrespected this ice, I got a neck full
You go in the liquor store and get eight nips
Me? I look in the mirror, say this

I, I love you
Gotta jump back, just kiss myself like

Gotta jump back, just kiss myself like

In Jersey with my friends and mama listening to Prince
As we sip some vodka and press my headphones with Balenciaga
Said she need some hot niggas, I said, ""We hotter""
Mine came from whipping up, like Betty Crocker
Said, ""They getting money like you,"" I better stop her
You need medical attention, I said a doctor
Imagine that, my stock in NASDAQ
Look, I ain't jacking that, I just got my masters back
She started to laugh, said she was fucking with me
I laughed too, yeah, you know nobody fucking with me
Can't front 'cause she know I'm that dude
She like it when I'm nice but she love it when I'm rude
I got her that purse, pairs of shoes, and belt
Quarter mil' in ice that refused to melt

I never get used to this guala

Blunted with some hash
Because I stunted on my past, fronted on the cash
Every car I bought in the last ten years had two hunnid on the dash (What else please?)
Your baby mother been labeled a hoe
All my niggas they say she the GOAT
Call her cocaine, 'cause she was able to blow
I ran through her like The 6, I made her say ""woah!""

But left tucked up the ice
Then ordered some duck and rice

The mall dame is my ball game
Aw mayne, he's buyin' denim from Balmain

Remember Game,The Program,2017,"I been going thru this bullshit too long
My ex don't know the definition of move on
She ran down on me like, “Cam, I heard your new song”
You hot now, oh you done forgot, you was luke-warm
You done forgot, son, you done forgot, son
You from the block, son, I was with you on the ave selling hot ones
Trips to Ohio and back, who rolled shotgun?
It was me, I-7-6, I-8-0, I-9-5 in a Datsun
Where you gonna find another bitch like me, nowhere ‘cause its not one
So I asked her, what is this all about?
Are we playing the remember game?
Are we playing the remember game? (shh)
Some things will never change
You slept on that mattress, who bought you that better frame?
You was made at your gut, right, tummy tuck, who paid for a better frame?
Or maybe perhaps when your mother had a relapse
Who talked to her all night? All night, walked her right into rehab
Like a debt I cleaned her up, when Scotty wanted to beam her up
And when I park the Beamer up, who was right behind me? Girl, in a Beamer truck
Or when your brother put hands on you, who came thru with the flamer to steam him up?
We ran in the house with the guns and the mask, wait
Can’t even talk about that, I don't wanna talk about that
But why girl would you flush 5 ki-los right down the toilet like that?
Good thing the Mexicans trust me with the work, boy
Might of been in Mexico, buried down in the dirt, boy
What I do next week (what I do?) even though I almost left earth, boy
Bought you every color bag, green, red, turquoise
So I ask you, are we playing the remember game, huh?
Are we playing the remember game?
High top, low top, Gucci, Louis, bracelets rings and some better chains
Me you can never game, girl, you need some better aim
And there are some things that you know I will never name
I don't give a fuck though 

Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Who held you down when you did that bid?
When you caught that charge, had to raise our kid
Five years up in buffalo, never let you go
On that bus every weekend
I was bagin’, it cookin’ it, puttin’ that work in
Holdin’ that hammer, do you remember?
Remember when they ran up in the crib, tied me up for six hours
They had a gun to my head, when I called you I was crying
Shot you in front of me, what would I do if I was to lose you?
Did you forget that? ‘Cause I will never
You remember when I took that loss
I used my inheritance, my savings and everything so you could be up again
You was down for a minute, played my position, ‘cause I knew you would win
You had violated me, more than once
Bitches calling, texting my phone
(That was my cousin)
Nigga that wasn’t your cousin, everybody your fuckin’ cousin
(Deadass)
No, that was some other hoe
Thought I was gona , or I’d never know
Your lucky I didn’t get ratchet and go get the ratchet
She’d be in a casket or wrapped up in plastic
And left where the trash is
You don't want the madness
‘Cause shit can get drastic
Had me thinkin’ it was just us
Finding lip gloss, panties in the car
Playing the remember game, are we playing the remember game?
So why you acting like you don't remember names
When my homegirl saw you leaving a three-hour telly
With that bitch you told me not to worry about
You was mad when I found out
Made her get rid of that baby
‘Cause you know I was crazy
10 years trying to play me
Had me fighting your bitches
Thought I was the only one you’d miss
When you would give me those kisses on my forehead
Those back rubs little long strokes from the back
Pulling and grabbing my hair
Choking me cause I like that
Doing it everywhere yeah, I remember that",https://genius.com/Camron-remember-game-lyrics

When I don't wanna do a feature (What you do?)
I look inside my phone and laugh (Why you laugh?)
Why? ’Cause indeed its funny
Want 12 bars? Let me fuck your baby mother
Word to mother, (Word to mother) Why?
Nigga, I don't need your money
This game here easy-peasy (Easy-peasy)
Easy as riding a bike
Flyest nigga whenever I’m around, mayne (’Sho is)
I’m start wearing a kite
Shit, I might wear one tonight
Matched with a fresh pair of Nikes
Whenever I’m talkin’ or walkin’
You can declare it a flight, flight (Back off)
Left with that bird talk
Step back, kiss myself
Let the church talk

Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah  baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby

Let me take a second, mayne (Take your time)
Yes, to speak to the church (Talk homie)
When it came to life, boy
Harlem niggas, we weren’t receiving the perks (Sure wasn’t)
They believed we were the worst (We the worst?)
Yeah, they would see us as jerks
‘Til I got this thing called Dipset
They laughed at me and said, “Boy, let see if it works”
I-I-I-I’m in the streets with the work
I used to think we were cursed
I can get deep with this verse
Had a pistol that burst, shots would leave and disperse
Cracked a dude, smacked his girl and told her I’m keeping your purse (Fuck outta here)
Got to thank the Lord tho (Thank God)
I’m in God’s classroom
‘Cuz a nigga got 8 cars now, (What else?) 4 cribs and 17 bathrooms
Yeah, I try to get it baby, (Everyday) it’s just a routine, nigga
Never ever, ever hit the lottery
All I had was a dollar and a dream, nigga
Let the church talk

Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah  baby
Hallalujah baby
Hallalujah baby, let the church talk

Fleegod,The Program,2017,"You don't know just what your soul does
When there's no love and you sold drugs
On the first of the month like Bone Thugs
And the damn funds just won't budge
And you live right where the crime was and the nines bust
You tryna shine 'cause the grinds on your mind
Sold nickel and dime without doing time. Don't mind us!
Still get computer's 'putin
Nuisance, don't care 'bout your two cents
You vexed, you'll never get the blueprint
Switch siders, hopping a new fence
Relax before I relapse, these facts
Squeeze that three caps where you eat at
What you call feedback, bro, I don't need that
Believe that, go home with your kneecaps
Blowing on Cheech & Chong, them sweet ass chron'
To each his own, make media leaches leave alone
Fuck sticks and stones, get beat to bones
You reach for phones, I reach for chrome
Then lie when gunshots reach your dome
Think these is poems? You've seen all the money and cars
You'd think that Meech was home
Monogamy, nah, possibly do pornography
Listen to my philosophy, Cam's autobiography
Outside on Lennox Ave with the coke and the crack
And the pen and the pad with the MAC in the back of the 'lac
While I'm racking on racks, you looking at endless swag
From Cassius Clay to bouncin' yay
In the fastest way, put the gas away
'Cause all you gon' hear is, ""What's his name died...""
""What's his name died?"" he done passed away!
Pull out the arms, body armor on
Dead to a farm by a bag of hay, you a castaway
Sunday through saturday, St. Patrick's Day
Mother's Day, any other day, Labor Day, Father day
Your death date on your death certificate
Is our day, that's what I would say
I beg your pardon, Vanessa Carlton
Yeah, we a thousand miles away
At the ballet, wearing Balleys
That's out of date, that's our debate
What you wanna eat baby, trout? Steak?
Steak, potatoes? How about baked?
Inner city, out of state
I want dessert, that pound of cake
You sounded safe, from down the base
We'll surround your place with a pound of tape
Put around your waist, then bound your face
Legs and arms, you down to race?

Right by the bath house
Moving yay twice a day, had 'em bringing cash out
Hefty bag? Nah, they wasn't bringing trash out
Like that posse out in Brooklyn we would mash out
Body builder, I be slinging weight around
Tell Ben Affleck I got something to wake the town
See I made it 'round, yeah make it round

Dime after dime

The whole neighborhood trapped up, your Lieutenant grab

Hitting up the same town lay down
By any means, AM track, Peter Pan
Greyhound made round
I'll sold it anywhere
Walmart, project building, playground
I'll be everywhere
West, Midwest, up North, way down
But you will respect me, still protects me
Still come check me, no wholesale

I'm like a crack addict
With these Macs I've got a bad habit
Clack-clack, in the pen, back out, I'm back at it
It's like my lawyer know black magic, black rabbit
Out the black hat, black. Back home to my Craftmatic
Next to it: stash mattress. Under it: cash, bastard
Had them bitches ass-backwards, fuck 'em like a jackrabbit
Is she crab status? Call the girl a itchy twat
Stick me not, I go and get dutches, it's a 50-box
I got weed, hash; when I breeze past, breathe fast
Eat ass on point like Steve Nash
But I'm fixin to be OG Nixon in 3
Enough jewels, you fools - I'm cool! - my kicks are a G
I got tramp whores. Yours!
Been V.I.P. since B.I.G
I never seen a dance floor (Nope!)
Behind the velvet rope, pop bottles, hella smoke
Girls with contacts want contact, I tell 'em ""nope!""
You go ""Pon' de River"": leave you in ponds and rivers
Don Juan, a Long John, the long arm of harm'll hitchya

Get ya money up, jewelry tight, swagger right

Cause I'm Batman with the pump, Johnny Johnny

In one ear, yeah yeah, 220 thou'

Po-Po wanna pick his brain, ho's wanna give him brain
We rose up to bigger fame, glows from the tennis chain
Make foes wanna get him slain, these hollows will twist a man
I left out of Clinton Max, got picked up by Killa Cam fam
We on another level, I'm bout to pull that Porsche out
And flood the other bezel, I get dug like shovels
Y'all niggas fuck with pebbles; I flip big boulders
Switch Rovers, hit 'em with the gun that's in his holster
You could gargle cum, ma; why sip soda?
These niggas wanna be Scarface, I'm with Sosa
You need to have my number if you wanna buy weight
Fuck a borough, we floodin' the whole Tri-State
20 thou' on the arm, more rocks on the charm
And I done copped from every damn haze spot on Audubon
Heavy weed smoker, get ounces for free
Add up everything you got, it ain't amountin' to me
I'm in the Crown Victoria, Mac in the back
See these little niggas rappin' to rap, man I just happen to rap
Know what I do: manufacturing crack
Keep talking, get you snatched for that scratch, clapped with the Mac

I have to beef, he look like a gorilla, with rabbit teeth
Bugs monkey, act hard, with a crack god, that mack broads
That video ain't Queens, it's your backyard(Connecticut)

You bangin' five shootin' rocks and signs my way
Fine play I keep it neutral but my family's nine, trey
Soo woo, my A-alikes, that stay to fight, from day to night

You know what he told him?
""Since you saw me last, something happened to me""

Time to get the facts across
Ohh, somebody pissed the pastor off
I'm all for the jokes, bundle up, get your coat
But I only go for the throat, I'm a chimney, I want the smoke
You done opened up a door, I'm petty, ready for war
I ain't got a sister, only sister I fucked was yours
I know the bars off The Program touched you
How you mad at me, though, you let Mr. Royce touch you (facts)
Do what you must do
Me, I'm getting my just due
But who you talking tough to? Blinky just snuffed you
Puff fucked you, we've seen it, no binoculars
Passed you to 50, he was finger popping ya
Then he took it back like a fly bitch that was popular
You're 42 still saying ""Ain't no stopping ya""
You know my deals—liquor, movie, and flashy kicks
How you talking deals? Your last deal was '96
Your flight book it, talking about I'm crooked
Man, I don't steal; if I took something I took it
Pastor Mason, no fabrication, we're winnin'
See all these people you spinning, I'll take it to the beginning
When Corey Wright japped you, Baby Maine yapped you
Roc open-hand slapped you, you still gave him dap, too
That's when I asked you, ""Murda, what's the verdict?""
You said, ""Nah, chill, Cam, I feel like I deserved it""
What kind of shit is that? Nigga, you a queer
My crib in Orlando, I had that for years
The Program gave you the biz
You know exactly what this is
I got homes where you hide, I hustle where you live
Max B from my building, nigga, who you getting wavy off of?
Fugazi baby, going off that water not Avianne
Listening to Suga J, look, he gon' play you wrong
Carmelo took Lala, Meek Mill took his baby mom
And let the church talk, hallelujah

No, it ain't a game, I still roll with the stainless
And you know my slogan, nigga, I'll make you famous
I'll use my brain so I will leave you brainless
So where you wanna meet at, nigga?
(YOU NAME IT!)

So you gon' tell me when you was staying with Puff, and I came over there and used the bathroom, it wasn’t a dildo on the sink?
I asked you, ""What the fuck is going on, man?""
FACTS!

Remember when you dissed trap? You said it was the devil's work
Look at this nigga, yo—see how the devil work?
Wolves on your ass though, I told them all to pardon ya
Why you talking Harlem? You from Jacksonville, Florida
I used to give you all my clothes, don't forget you was bummy
I fed you when you was hungry, crash test, dummy
But the shit he said next, I swear it ain't funny
Said ""Cam, become a deacon, them deacons be getting money""
That's blasphemous, word to Jesus and Lazarus
You got bad karma, stay away, he hazardous
Collection plate money in his pocket, he a klepto-
And to get a dollar dollar you were suckin' Creflo
2 albums, 20 years, come on, this is dead, bro
Only time they mention this nigga when it's retro
Money gone, jewelry fake, you could hear an echo
I'm what you could have been, you was too petro
I took your broad, they all know you a fraud
And the only show you got, the Lady of Soul Awards
He might be nominated, I'm your little mama favorite
Any hood I go to, I'm accommodated
What you mean I'm selling liquor now? You a jizzerk
Forgot 10 years ago I gagged out on Sizzurp
Oh Boy cologne, I was giving niggas that wizzork
I ain't even spend that Killa Season money, man, you hit dirt

No, it ain't a game, I still roll with the stainless
And you know my slogan, nigga, I'll make you famous
I'll use my brain so I will leave you brainless

Look homeboy, I ain't trying to get no names
Must of sniffed cocaine, looking at my Diplo chain
The biscuit turn you to bisquick mixed with shrimp lo mein
Old ladies just stop and say ""it's yo thang""
Can't deny 'em, look down my wrist go bling
Bling bling, listen in, come and get some cash
First kiss my ring, ohh no, well kiss my ass
Back in my zone homes, get ya mind right
The 2-3 or 3-2, nah it's the twilight
It's the highlights of my life
Every gun, car, crib, chicken-head that I like
Ten on the dope, ten that's beside knife
Ten in the hood, ten that's besides night
And they tied tight, my family ties tight
Ten town, 200 bricks, forget 5 mics

You gotta feel the heathen, we guerrilla breathin'

Alright we got this man
Let me hear a hook on this

It's kind of hard to doubt that we ain't a slaughterhouse
Dip radio you're now tuned in to the Hardest Out
Slash the first to ride, you ain't never heard of fly
Call it how you want in nigga my G's is certified

Yo I slow flowes y'all to death
These hustlers acting like they coke hard to stretch
Any broads wanting me to put cash in they purse
Like they wrote half of my verse, nope
I give a few some credit,tell ya dude bring my cash on the first
Plus I hold a welfare card cause that's how I work
I'm bout to buy a Aston Martin, throw you in the trunk
Be at the Funk Flex show, with you in the trunk
If they said I couldn't do it, they put me to the test
But I proved to all them suckers I was worthy of success
Teacher said I was a uhh, was wasting time in her class
It was more like she was wasting mine, I had them dimes on the ave
Mamma said I was a dead shot locked up in a can
Nope, got it popping with Cam, up in a drop like Shabam
But why they knocking that man, cause of the rocks on his hand
Or the Air Forces they'll never see cause they got copped at Japan
Damn, man I know he a gangsta, and he pop his steel
He supposed to be dead or locked up why he got a deal?
He was just shooting a uzi, now he shooting a movie
And all his mans starting to act like groupies
I slow flowed y'all to death
These hustlers acting like my flow hard to catch
Man Diplomats we the strongest force
On or off the court we ball and ball the sport

It's kinda hard to doubt that we ain't a slaughterhouse
Dip radio you're now tuned in to the Hardest Out
Slash the first to ride, you ain't never heard of fly
Take it how you want it coward our G's is certified

Sleepin' high with visions of my enemies
Beggin' for mercy crawling on the floor like a centipede
Screaming Rell please don't shoot me I got children
Should've thought about those snotty nose kids when you was snitching
But now I'm on a mission, yeah fresh out the kitchen
A stand up dude who only sit when he shhh
You sit when you pissing, dude listen
My talent was God-given, got wise by hard living
I Sleep all day, smoke haze, ménage women
I spit these hard rhythms it feel like a car hit 'em
So leave that boy a lone can't you see he in the zone
Dudes try to be like 'em can't you see he getting cloned
All this blue and this yellow can't you see it in the stones
And yeah we brought them hammers Cam we never leave 'em alone
So move back, I'm poppin off the 4
Heaven let me in because I'm knocking on ya door
It's Prada on my whores
And nah I don't really do to many funerals, but I gotta go to yours
I gotta see the face of a coward
Please man let the homie breathe give me a taste of the power
My chain hate my watch, my watch hate my ring
My jewelry going crazy, gotta get some new bling

How to hit that curb, how to get that served
Youngin, I'm the shhh, that's word

Huh, come get wit a rebel, I'll put the kick to the pedal

Dipset is forever B, bet y'all remember me
Stretch all my enemies, heckler send 'em three
But, I got a tek that'll get a G
To drop his flag like a ref on a penalty
I'm fresher than lemon squeeze, wrist wrap chill
Pitch black car wit them pitch black wheels
Nice more stash box, big black steel
Leave you at the red light, the kid's that real!
Stepping in his Nikes, freshest in your sight
You ain't never seen these F-in Pella in ya life!
I throw on fresh gear, throw on fresh wear
This is something you will have to throw on next year, Yea!


Listen scrap believe me, you need crack to see me
I'm a classic, one of your old scratched up CD's
Nigga Check my swag it's easy
That you can see I do the damn thing and I ain't Fab or Jeezy
I stepped through the trap wit Weezy
Front of the tenements
Posted up on post, hundred Dominicans
That'll clap you soon as you go to beef wit J
Throw a couple at you once they hear Dida Le!
Put your brains all across the pavement
You niggas singing like you singing how you talk to agents
But drop my name, and I'm a stop
Throw in a box like some cats at a hop-scotch game
I copp drops mane, come peep what I whip whore
A 62, got it jumpin like a 6-4
Soon as I hit tour, brrr, caught a chill
Sleeves on freeze, add up to a quarter mil!
I'm bout to talk my deal, that's what a thug about
Killa, hit Sharon, tell her I need another house!
I dig ya mother out, then put her in a cab
Gas her up then hit the hooker wit them slabs
What you think? Naw I ain't a rookie wit it fag
She'll have to boof that in a cookie like a pad
You rookies are just mad, you can't say shit to me
You gotta get rid of me, I'm bout to make history


I mean, hold on, that's three and out, hold on
Don't even play yet put that on pause B
New York City, we gonna take a slight intermission
Because if you do this up here, you bitin
We knocked three songs out. You can only do it in one take
That means we didn't punch in. That means I one taped it
J.R. one taped it. Hell Rell one taped it. We chorused it out
That means the business is right
The rhymes is right and if you come up here and try freestyle a song
You're bitin (you swagger jackin)
I mean you did a solo song Hell Rell right
That means you repped BX Borough, you repped the Dominicans
I'm 140 and Lennox to the death
So we might as well do something together
Capo get ready to take the motherfu...uh
Capo take the Maserati up to 200, we goin in, lets go

Determined to be bigger, birds I serve 'em to these niggas

I need to say sorry, y'all already knew it
But my pride won't let me do it, though
Heard that, it's pride, won't let me do it though
Best girl in the world, I might've blew it
Like a small condom, I'll get through it though
I'll get through it though
Heard that, we can do it though
I cheated, another one in the books for me
She clean, roll weed, and cook for me
Ain't hear from the kids, she would look for me
Now she so mad that she won't even look at me
Damn iPhones and cameras, nights in Atlanta
Tried to bring you gifts, she said, ""You ain't Santa""
I'm just showin' manners, she reachin' for the hammer
She ain't got ears, they replaced with antennas
Hard to believe I messed trust up
No good or bad, just tough luck
I looked her in the eyes like, ""I fucked up""
Gripped up, my life had to monetize
Made mistakes, I apologize
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
Dinner, movie, a date, you know, maybe that
Some dudes relate, I want my baby back
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah)
I tell you a million times, I'm sorry
Wild life right here, no safari
I'm dressed up, I 'fess up
I messed up bad...

Later on that night, I bought a kilo
To sell it or sniff it, man I don't know
'Cause I got pulled over by po-po
Oh no-o-o-o-o-o

Day-to-day life dealin' with reality
Lawyer got me off on a technicality
All I think about, we was Mickey and Mallory
Nothin' left but increase my salary
Uh, now money is the focus
Hustlin' president, POTUS
Anything else right now is bogus
Real estate opened up, I gave notice
Murder was the case, Calvin Broadus
Blue magic though, hokus pokus
They forgot that my dope's the dopest
Made a mil' in one week, yeah it's poppin'
Retail therapy, out shoppin'
Pulled off the lot, top droppin'
No legs on the car, but it's boppin'
Speakers in the door, so it's knockin'
I got all the keys, so I'm locked in
Felt above the law, Johnnie Cochran
And I'm off the rebound, Rodman
Woo! Let's get this money, baby
Let's get this money, baby
Ain't nothin' funny, baby
La-la-la-la-la

Later on that night, I laid in my bed
Them birds was chirpin', so I'm countin' up bread
But I can't get her up out my head

1st of The Month,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Ayo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tune with
The moon and the stars
Some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught - pissy clubs
Saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star - nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds
Run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, ayo
Go get that yayo, yayo
Killa, paper, holla at Pedro
On the 8-0 and wait for my son, the lay low
Ba' bro

When I beef, names will be said, tool will be spread
Two in your head, body be bagged, eulogy read
Dog in the news will get read
Cause what I deal with is usually feds
On the first

Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
It's the first of the month
Yayo yayo! Yayo yayo!
It's the first of the month

Now I'm the type of dude
Post up, sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties: You want it? I got it
You see it, you like it
We count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a ""menace to the public society""
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it, I'm driving, I'm puffing, high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving
I'm bugging, my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc, it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers
For all their milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
You niggas follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in


Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me and still a little nigga?
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done
Steak and chicken for the fridge
And their kids fly.. I ain't open, friend
On the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes
Barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam for some coke again

Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image
It's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people
Why? Because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people",https://genius.com/Camron-1st-of-the-month-lyrics

Major crime made me grind, copped fancy heat
You know hater time, cat food, Fancy Feast
Dated Nancy niece, she like candy treats
God damn she sweet, we did Delancey Street
We hopped the D train, you don't understand the streets
No hassle heffer, did we battle? Never
We went Easter shoppin', coppin' them tassled leathers
From Gimbels with game, make it simple and plain
I wanna nibble on ya ear, rekindle the flame
I'm God's child, but yeah I got devilish game
Once you meddle wit' Cam, ma'am it's never the same

They don't ever remember shit, all they want is their membership
Only one that they gettin' is jackets, that's the end of it
They want designer recliner along with benefits
Won't take a risk, but wanna spend a mick
Wipe 'em off my agenda quick, I need the other gender thick
You see my Monday to Fridays, I need a Friday to Sunday
We'll eat Friday's on Fridays, and go to Sunday's on Sundays
Drink a little liquor, maybe twist a L
Play catch and kiss, if you don't kiss and tell
Take the city bus or come through with chauffeurs
We could do Air Ones hun or Louie loafers
Yeah I'm truly focused, take down your Snoopy posters

Extra money, extra piff, extra blunts

You my one, no other
But discovered undercover that you're jealous of my mother
Baby, so from here girl I blow a kiss
And it's me I know she miss
'Cause when I left I told her this

There comes a time
In every girl's life
She'll have to cry, cry, cry
Cry baby, sometimes
There comes a time
When your heart can't take no more
And you'll have to cry, cry, cry
Cry baby

I know
Fucking shame, you fucked what's his name?
That's when your luck changed, got rid of that plush range
The whole bus train give your guts pain
Now you stuck strange, a bum without cupped change (Haa)
Nah, I don't want to have a seat
You know a counselor? Cool, we don't have to meet (Not at all)
Just hear me well, B, I'm gone, and put him back to sleep
Woke him up with this dumb shit cause you mad at me
We got beef? Go ahead, speak your mind (Talk!)
Like I was with you before, when you ain't had a dime
I'm Swayze, she crazy
I went to the door, turned around and I said baby
You my one, no other
But discovered undercover that you're jealous of my mother
Baby, so from here babe I blow a kiss
And it's me I know she miss
When I left I told her this
One time

There comes a time
In every girl's life
She'll have to cry, cry, cry
Cry baby, sometimes
There comes a time
When your heart can't take no more
And you'll have to cry, cry, cry
Cry baby",https://genius.com/Camron-girls-cry-lyrics

I'm in that White House, I'm what all that hype's about
I am the general
I keep the lights on, the head of this family
I moves mountains, there's nothing you can sell me
I tear the world down just to build it back again
Like it's a fairy tale

Boy, chill -- 'course the boy will
Do you greasy -- BP oil spill
Boat rides, bow ties
Coke flies so high, oh my
Listen, scram, Cam'll turn you into maggot food

Nah, I'm Eric Wright,  with a attitude
Then I hit her with some 'Pac -- ""I ain't mad at you""
Y'all stay shook, I'm straight crook
I made appointment for head, that face book
And I stay in drama, but anything with honor
I hit your BBM -- your broke baby momma
And I won't stop, I'm on my Diddy 
Yeah, they start to like me, then they find out I'm a idiot
All they do is look and say, ""Mmm-mmm, pretty slick""
And your girl is like my knot -- pretty thick


Shout to my black president, Obama
Tell the cops chill, though; find Osama
Secret Service, sorry -- I don't want no drama
You'll be enemy of the state; whoa, mama!
Gucci boots with the strap, all brown, though
You're worthless, same circus -- different clowns, though
My scoundrels on Greyhounds with pounds, though
We take trips with bricks -- hey, you down, ho?
Don't question me, play enough clown, yo
I get the whistle cause you're way out of bounds, mo
We fly high, fly guys, aideo!
Y'all burgers like Five Guys, adios


Young girls say I'm fly, cute -- I reply mute
F5 coupe I pull up to my stoop
Kissing in public? That's preposterous
Superman? Nah, but the crip is Metropolis
My day? It consists of driving bricks
Picking money up, getting head, copping kicks
Then the studio -- I don't even stop and piss

Hey Suga Duga
Sold a million and ain't comfortable? Poor boy (poor boy Shawn)
And you thirty you still could go to the store boy
Well at the store get a Windex, clean the Range (that's for the windows)
Chicken wings and fried rice, keep the change (keep that, $2)
Admit you got the coupe shot, well you lame buzzin (stupid ass)
I'm not Pac, Big or Harold, Kane cousin? (I'm not none of them)
Let me explain something, propane with the flames buzzing
Young fella, 
umbrellas can't stop when this rain coming (tat tat tat)
Lemme leave him alone, hop on a paper plane (with Fizzle)
Why I'm beefing for? He still ain't even say my name (he scaaaared)
He know the kid, the deal (deal), F how you bitches feel (feel)
I'm on the gravy train (train), it got biscuit wheels (biscuit wheels?)
The ones the chicks could feel, like Dorothy clicking heels
My car Babyface (why?)....it got that Whip Appeal (oww!)

Killa!
Where my baby, my baby
You know my lady, my lady
She never play me, just lay me
That's my suga duga (suga duga)

Hey suga Duga (suga duga)

Don't wanna hurt ya heart (not at all), I feel we deserve a start
You smart, and me ma? (huh), I'm a work of art (I'm a different story)
You I'm admiring, you feel that you tired then (why's that?)
School ain't paying and you saying they ain't hiring (been down that road)
Been there, told you different then I'd be lying then (I'd be lying)
My boss ain't have a gun so I was doing firing (that's another story)
That's neither here or there, it's you I'm tryna ask about (what you like?)
You like the internet, desire, fashion house? (I know you watching that)
You from a bad block, worst ave, dead street (both from Harlem)
Ya baby father, why bother, his nickname is dead beat (we'll break a deal)
You raise em' all alone, them kids you could call your own (your own)
You need a helping hand, well baby girl call the phone (gmme ya number)
You can't move in but my crib you could call your home, all the stones, just don't do me like Paula Jones


Hey Suga Duga! (hey boo boo!), pusher pusher (pusher?)
Calm down I ain't call you a hooker, hooker (right)
Nah I'm the nookie nooga (nooga), then I look and took her
""What about my man?"" (pffft), tell em' Cam getting booga booga (knocking her)
You know the toolery, the jewelry, he front they'll be a eulogy, you don't know about the kid, well Google me (dot com me)

Major crime made me grind, copped fancy heat
You know hater time, cat food fancy feast
Dated Nancy niece, she like candy treats
God damn she sweet, we did Delancey Street
We hopped the D train, you don't understand the streets
No hassle heifer, did we battle? never
We went Easter shoppin', coppin' them tassled leathers
From Gimbels we gained, make it simple and plain
I wanna nibble on ya ear, rekindle the flame
I'm god's child, but yea I got devilish game

Only one that they gettin is jackets, that's the end of it
They want designer recliner along wit benefits

Wipe 'em off my agenda quick, I need the other gender thick
You seen my Monday to Fridays, I need a Friday to Sunday
We'll eat Friday's on Fridays, and go to Sunday's on Sundays
Drink a little liquor, maybe twist a L
Play catch and kiss, if you don't kiss and tell
Take the city bus, or come through with chauffers
We could do Air Ones hun, or Louis loafers

Yo, I'm thinkin' 'bout aj
Ajinaye, name shoulda been ak
Willie hit the eastside, it was mayday
Red Bentley drop, let's play, play
Chuck stone home, my nigga ray, hey
Pass the brandy brother, I'm ray j
That was deep for y'all, that's just why I sleep on y'all
Peep it y'all, you creepin' any coke, give me a call
Can't stop the d's, but the d's can't stop the keys
Stop the cheese, all these damn shopping sprees
Louis this, gucci that, sacks, 5th
.9, tech, banana, mac clips
Go 'head and act sick, mac spits, backflips
That rich, a half a million dollars in the mattress
Stickup kids outside, tell 'em ""ah it's cool""
Thou will never ever ever get my jewels
Go 'head and try fool, die fool, I, cruel
Mean jet, tough car, bad bitch, fly pool
I'm professional, you high school
Mini hardware store, 5 tools
And they're all hammers, you'll turn pale-blue
Not the cops, ock, but I will nail you
Fishscale, that's on the scale boo
Run a train on your girl, then derail you

(You, you) this is how you get rich
Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich
Yeah, yeah, this is how you get rich
Bitch, bitch, bitch

We talkin' codes on the phone, jellocake
I see my enemy, well look, hello snake
Killa, calm, yeah I'm in a mellow state
Anytime, any moment, they'll be yellow tape
And y'all hesitaters call on your investigators
Legislators, yo you should invest in a respirator
Like Warren G and Nate Dogg, I'm a regulator
I'm on the top ock, catch the next escalator
I want fast head, mami give me slow dome
Wish she can hurry up, so she can go home
Or go roam, I'm so grown
Sun hit the ring, it look like a snowcone
And you synthetic, forget it, I'm connected, respected
What you expected, yo check it, it's genetic
Fuck with me you will regret it, in the ground you'll be embedded
Let's bet it, don't wanna bet it, the best bet is to get it, forget it
The abominal, phenomenal phenomenon
Bomb with' no drama, whole llama blow at abdominals
They fallin' like they dominoes, what we got in common though
Nuttin' cause I'm comma after comma after ho
They bonded though
Wonder where I wander though, where I'm a go
How I'm a flow, they baffle how I'm on the dough, on the low
Babygirl I'm honorroll and right now I'm on a roll
Born to roll, pay your toll, hurry up, get on the pole
Shake it like a tambourine, peel it like a tangerine
Fuck bumpin', liet's get it jumpin', like a trampoline
Damn, his tramp is mean, I want head for sure
Then I looked down, mami need a pedicure
Yeah your feet dun, I told her ""please hun""
I been gettin' money since each one, teach one
And this rap, singer, crack-slinger, mac-blinker
Yak-linger, look at the pinky ring on that finger

I ain't gon' front, I always thought he was a survivor
Shells and rounds, held 'em down, when he was in the fire
Now feds got him tapped from the sneakers to attire
Just like Kanye West, speakin' through the wire
Like: ""Don't forget, make sure you speak into the wire!""
Thinkin' not he was singin', he would be up in the choir
When I find 'em, I'ma put the heater to his visor
All he's gon' see is the screechin' on the tire
Up the block, bang a right, make a left
Thang I light, made 'em stretch
Candlelights, graves are set
Not only that though - all his weight was wet
Hustle dummies, fucked up money, and was way in debt

It was all good just a week ago
We was together smokin', hella reefer smoke
All in the vehicle
I got the word back: he was in the vehicle
With the D's, I bet he thought he was low
Damn, this nigga spent the night in my crib
Sat in my mom's kitchen, now he go off snitchin'
But this my man, I could just stop fuckin' wit' 'em
Like I'm just not fuckin' wit''em...or just pop one up in 'em
Plus - there's rules here: if you play where the rats play
You gotta go, you must lay where the rats lay
Hate to see a nigga that I broke bread with
His whole head split - cold, dead, stiff

See he opposed when we slapboxed
Then we dove the crack rocks
Jackpot: Golden Rolls when we drove the Jag drops
Du-rag top, ock, we cut the cheese together
Legos, ate Eggos, went to Chuck E. Cheese together
We watched Chucky, Shucky Ducky, we were lucky
Had a Huffy, then a buggy
Sold dubs, and twenty three's the weather
Now he got the nerve, to get lazy, watch me serve
With guac? or herb, now he gettin 'jealous cuz I'm coppin' birds
And he wired like MoneyGram, I got the doctrine
Went to the spy store so I watched who's watchin'
And you thinkin' that Cam's sweet? Damn the street
Fuck rock he ran to sleep, I'm cuttin off his hands and feet
And his glands and teeth...Yeah, the mission get done
Dunn, this bitch is the one, that told me to christen my son!
And the muscle tight, he wouldn't tussle, fight
Fucked up his juggle, he couldn't hustle right
Shoulda came for a loan, you know that scrilla's like
But what's ill tonight, Killa gotta kill his wife
Yup, address her homey, won't say he left her lonely
Seen some transactions, don't need a testimony
And I'm no punk, I pump lead bastard
When I dump, you'll get bumped, yeah them bunkbed caskets
And a brother just smiled, I just got him a ditch

I have to beef, he look like a gorilla, with rabbit teeth
Bugs Monkey, act hard wit' a crack god that mack broads
That video ain't Queens, it's your backyard
Cuurtis, what's messing wit' ya head bad
Ya dead mad, but dag that, security with red flags
You bangin' 5, shootin' rocks and signs my way
Fine play, I keep it nuetral, but my family's 9-Trey
Soo-Woo, my A.R. lights that stay to fight from day to night
When I smack the Lightey brothers, Dave and Mike
Huh, believe me hoe, you can't G me though
Jimmy ain't the president, he the CEO
Zeke is the president, it's evident, he'll cock and spray
Santana underboss, I sign off like Dr. Dre
I f**k with Zo Pound too, waddup, Sa Pa Se
Grab the cocoa macok, tessozo, rock away
I extended the clip, never be friends with you pricks
Shout to a real Queens dude, ya know, Kenneth McGriff
He ran from police, you run with police
You ain't from Southside
You 'bout to get your mouth wide

Banks bricked, Mobb bricked, Buck ain't been out for three years
Lemme be fair, I hop up off a sweet Lear

I can't be clowned, beef dog, how dare we now

Whoever wore that outside was a homo, gay ass nigga
Ay yo stop calling my probation officer too
Why you talkin' 'bout my probation
You tryna get me locked up Curtis
Ay yo Curtis you really tryna get me locked up
You said something about my probation on your song
Next thing you know my probation officer called me today, said they need to see me
Ay yo if I go to jail, Curtis put me in jail
It's crazy, how I gotta report to probation next Thursday
I ain't supposed to report for three weeks
I gotta go Thursday and he mentioned my probation

And they father come from a long lista dons
And I get it cheaper, I cop bricks like sneakers
And if the cops come, I just hit amnesia

But I'm a hustla, in my heart, trapped is the game
A test of my frame, tapped to my brain, affects that remains
It wasn't rap, it was crack that got the racks on the Range
Look dog, don't be askin' for dames, see
Playboy, I don't own that man
In any way homeboy, you a grown ass man, shit
And when I rap, it ain't no punchlines

If they find that stash box, just one time

Side of the road, holding you up, cold as a fuck

Soon as they lunge it and push it, I'll run in the bushes

Take my chances, one on one with the K9

Yup, he said I'm cute, tried to throw me in the loop
Hit me when he hungry, lick my cookies, drink my apple juice

No hassle, hit 'em with the gavel, ask 'em, my whole staff will shoot
What could the bastard do?
They run, we run this town, we'll run you down, they'll laugh at you
Damn no, look at mommy shakin' her derriere
Fuck Christmas, you could have a merry year
Where you wanna go? Everywhere, what you wanna do? Let me hear
I'm talkin' Vegas, I don't do them teddy bears
But I do, do the fishnets
Pre-ejaculation and get my dick wet
But I'm tryin' to get your lips wet

(DukeDaGod)
Before we get into this Killa Season
Let's start this shit off with my man 40 Cal
(40 Cal.)
Who am I? 40 Cal. motherfucker
Gat to your back, get down motherfucker
Clown motherfucker
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Let me try to explain
I shoot his truck up just to drive him insane
Give his Rover the new name, the firing range
When we see you yell fire and aim
Cause when I fire them thangs it's like
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
I gotta watch who wit me, watch who pretty
Drop two-fitty on a hot new Bentley
But when it come to drops say he cop too many like, damn
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Down with wonderful Cal. (they make Hummers in brown?)
Nah I just shitted on you, even haters lovin my style
I'm a role model, I make the hustlers proud
I make the customers smile
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Catch me in them thangs with Jennifer, BM's with Olivia
If it ain't Vivica or somebody sim-i-lar
Comin down the block the suspense is killin ya like, wow
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
That's Cal. we see him (we see him) we leavin (we leavin)
He schemin, he be beastin
Heard he kill people, we believe him
Oh shit he's reachin
(You will be wonderin what are we gonna do now)
Killa Killa Killa Killa!
Killa (Killa!) Killa Killa Killa! (Killa!)
(Verse 1)
Dial killa for murda once, no redial
Just see child, the O G style and how I used to be wild
This the story of Cam'ron and Zeke Giles one way road to the P now
Yea the whoscal, ohh child you wasn't there
Zeke snitched, if he did, I'd be doin a hundred years
Did the interstate, big cities, tiny ones
Took over niggas towns, black ties, tiny bums
Handsome hoods, pretty thugs, but we grimy dun
Cars, cribs, money, had to find me some
Zeke right behind me dun dun, he play by all the rules
That's why the house is his, the cars, all the jewels
Ya'll niggas all are fools, your regular married with children
Dawg, nine to five, office, pool
Couldn't live that life, I needa loft and pool
I had too much class, I ain't report to school
If they report to school, I caught the stool, extort the fool
Took off his jewels, thought he cool, gun to mouth, they often drool
Fuckin wit this wolf, this should be taught to you
Ya money don't matter, what you can't afford to do
Is fuck wit me dawg, that could be affordable
Hide ya mom, police protection, that's when I'm cordial
Cars convertible, TV's are portable
Fiends on line, coke lines, they come and snort a few
Killa!
(Chorus)
(KILLA!)
Guns, cars, bitches, and (KILLA!)
Weed, smoke, dope (KILLA!)
Glocks, ox ockin I'm cocked (KILLA!)
Cam, fam, damn, it's (KILLA!)
Season and the reason you breathin (KILLA!)
Who buy out the bar though? (KILLA!)
Who far from a star but they car is Gallardo? (KILLA!)
(Verse 2)
I was forced to eat, anything you lost I keep
Shot the fifth, and then like a Piston, toss the Heat (Bye)
Now round the corner, up the block, cross the street
Up fifty flights, iight where the bosses meet
And the Porsche is peach, felt like Boston George
Left Boston Market, did deals on Boston Beach
Now I bought the beach, all because they applaud my speech
One nigga crossed the chief I know you heard he lost his teeth, and it's
Killa!

Uh huh, yeah

This goes to all my hustlers, entertainers
And of course, athletes in the struggle

Yo, yo yo yo yo
Some get a little and some get none
Shit, I was part of the some get none
The ball, run for run, play the slums for crumbs
Wired, real tired, till my lungs are done
After all, I was nice in ball
But I came to practice weed scented
Report card like the speed limit
55-55 expellable
If your nice they make sure that you eligible
Pretty final, '92 played the city finals
Pretty swift, real mvp, and 55th
I can hoop, yo
All-American in my age group, yo
Raised bad settled for a ju. co. (junior college)
Uh, but why they let a thug on campus
All i did was rob and mug on campus
Sliced, rolled dice, got shiest on campus
At the toast got bad, payed the price on campus
Forgot about ball, I was done dude
Now I'm in county in an orange jumpsuit, middle of Texas
Call moms, she dont want the phone act
She dont condone it, Cam dont come home, shit

Cause the streets is a short stop
Either you slangin' crack-rock
Or you got a wicked jump shot

Yo, yo, ayo
Comin back home, I thought it'd be cool
But everbody like, Cam, ""Yo, i thought you in school""
Nah, im about to go back, huh, they know that im lyin'
See me on broadway, know what im buyin'
Niggas gettin' money, know what i'm eye'n
Shiesty again, no where without iron
Seems like my school life self destroyed
Fuck gettin' a job, BIG self employed
Slugs pop, drug spot, runnin' the thing
Played ball on the weekend, 300 a game
Till one of the workers pulled a small case
Mouth runnin' like a dog race, tryin' to get us all laced
I was slangin, but wasn't a kingpin
A slow case n', verdict probation
Tryed to fuck my P.O., she ignored that
Said, ""Know what Cam your found with more crack""
See what happen', stopped the crackin'
Start rappin', quit the clappin'


Yo, yo, as a young nigga, always into crime
But no matter what, yo, always used to rhyme
So in that i became more curious
Fuck bein' up north delirious, more serious
Uh, so Killa did mixtapes
CEO's heard, now here come big cake
But one cat said Cam you better recoup
Before you back on your block, baby, dead on the stoop
But Un hooked me up with all this cheddar and loot
The best rap deal of all time next to Snoop
Money more the clutch, money more the touch
I dont just rhyme I own liquor stores and such, but
Yeah
Yo, the rap game remind me of the crack game
Niggas wanna get they gun, then start the clap game
For dat fame
Throwa Untertainment
Sport, Drugs, Entertainment
Till the arrainment, Killa


That's how it go on my block
Mad props, let off mad shots

Only two months in, Damn my lawyers good
Ten bricks and a body that's l
ickin rich
Tell the DA, fly f**kin' witnesses
Sittin in the cell, I could just vomit
I took the word of Elijah Mohammed, became wiser as promised
Lies not honest, got ties with congress
I don't hate to see the boys
(Why)cause the tapes can be destroyed
They on the beat walkers, in my socks searchin me
It's not hurtin me, most cops work for me
Yo where Qweet, what up ma muah what
Where D at, damn yo we need that
Yo yo, my earnin' in question, I'm burnin' and sweatin'
You knowin' jail turn me depressing, I ain't learnin my lesson
You just a dumb spouse, I ain't gone run him out
I know where to find D rugs..over Un's house
(talking)
Get the Fuck off me, I'm goin to Un house
Get the fuck off me
Verse 2:
Yo, I knocked on the door, yo yo how it's lookin Un?
You seen d rugs, yeah I was cookin him
I ran to the kitchen, Oh my God damn look at him!
What's the problem with him Un, yo he lookin slim!
What you ain't treat him right, what's wrong he ain't eatin right
You fuckin wit him that's why you sneezin right..
What you mean duke, wit d rugs ya ass will get a mean tooth
You lookin like a fiend too
But he made me chedda, I'll take him to the death wit me
He felt the same, so the nigga left wit me
Now we back, and dealin in hoods, huh
Reunited and it feel so good
Fiends comin thru in fleeces and sweaters
Increasin my chedda, Happy just to see us together
Now we round up new click, competition too sick
D rugs black blue six, woooo shit
Verse 3:
It's like I'm born to rock on the block, still clockin
Me and D rugs hug but they still watchin, no options
She said man keep them mills poppin
The only way to keep you in, they got to kill Cochran
But he mixed business and pleasure, he get to me
And I'm a Geto Boy, my mind playin tricks on me
Optional, ay yo ""he still fuck wit ya moms?""
Naw man that's impossible, ""Yo I heard she left the hospital""
So I stepped to em both, needless to lie
My mother told me ""naw Cam chill he was prescribed""
She got to take him twice a day to keep her alive
And I'm sittin' here shocked yo, rain don't stop yo
What's that the lots yo, who that the cops yo
Female Tahoe, connect wit the Brosco
Fuck a hard case, I'm from a mob race
Why does this fuckin' feel like the end of Scarface
I'mma sucha sober, flip d rugs up to smell the odor
Told him, he f**ked us over
Then popped girl, to my mother, told her I love her
Plugged her, now only God can judge her
Now after this tragedy, d rugs laughed at me
He was here way before, and he'll be here after me..
Now here come the cops and the whole f**kin' calvary
Snorted d rugs and had them niggas blast at me

I went in for an interview, for delivery (for delivery)

You working on my future, why you need to know my history?
All he did was Google me, no big mystery
He ain't digging me, politely he was dissin' me
""No we're not hiring, but thanks for the visit please""
He ain't want me, my grandmother warned me
Them God damn felonies will haunt me, taunt me (I told you 'bout them felonies)
No second chance, back to the same block
Go home, my baby moms done changed locks (fuck is she doing)
This a game ma? Okay the games over (okay)
Then she opened the door with the chain on (what's up)
Said she been reaching out, for several days
I ain't helping out, we need to go our separate ways (oh word?)

Fantastic Four,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You never hear that we buckle
Beef? we chuckle
Scuffle over a game of pinochle
Anything up on my money, man, I gotta see double
Unless you want trouble
Oh, you realer now?
I'm the kind to cut a peace of soap, put it on the imbecile
Crack the hen rock style, give me the foul
Girls grope then I smile
That's when they fall cause they met my balls
Right after I played ball
No wash-up, no nothin'. hear what I say y'all?
O.k. y'all. ask aj y'all
I'll turn the baddest bitch gay y'all
Like stacy, damn, she was eatin' tracy's ass
At this other lady's pad
To get it on I had to call up desert storm
My cut-throats scar y'all, while you hope the don fall
But I'll come inside the tunnel, nigga, wit pope john paul
Yo, them niggas on the wall frontin', they ain't no harm y'all
My crew'll break each shoulder
I'm that nigga they talk about on street soldiers
Cause my street soldiers are heat holders and weed rollers
We keep two bones and two phones in each rover
We all relaxed and any beef we over-reactin
Peace to lorey actins, but I get buck wild like corey jackson
Playin' is called off, cause y'all about to get hauled off
Y'all all soft from smokin nicholi nigga, like volkof
Know what I mean yo? notice the cream grow
I fiend though, I'll come fuck up your whole town like el nino
I'm the hottest nigga you've seen though
Jumpin outta lex coupe
With jimmy jones right next to me in the benz truck too
Fuck all y'all non-believers
I roll wit god, the squad and ts
Out wit the b.s
We platinum, they even doubted jesus
Niggas is 85%, I'm 400 solid
Brainbolic wit knowledge, cock-diesel scholars
Holdin' it down, walkin' around wit gold by the pound
Frozen down wit diamond bolders all in the crown
Talk of the town
Soakin' you down wit the toast 'til you drown
Ghost you and put your corpse in force that'll open the ground
Save the jokes for the clowns
I'm on a serious tip
You keep playin' and I get furious quick
And now I take you for a walk in the ghetto
Even spark your metal and get outlined in chalk by the devil
I rep the borough that mothered this rap shit
I used to clap shit
Now I just lay back and mack on some mack shit
I used to have to pack a mack in the back of the acura
Now I relax and stack platinum plaques in my shack
It's like that but don't think I won't counter act
My niggas is strapped and quick to lay a bitch on his back
I'm swift with the mack, quicker than kung fu
With the reflexes of a cat and the speed of a mongoose
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
?Talk about huh? that's what we talk about thug shit
Now it's a symphony
Without me on it, it ain't a symphony
My crew shit on cats without tiffany
N-o-r-e, I just lace the heat
I don't complain about the track, give me any beat
I get he'd in the wip on any street
I fuck wit clue, other cats is snakes
I've been fuckin' with clue since he made 60 minute tapes
We copped mad bottles and crushed many grapes
We from the hood and they from the hood
The difference is we get plaques, they go double wood
Took the game right over at the time they could
Them niggas silly though, knowin' nore lay pretty low
But them niggas ishomos like the maxwell video
I got 2 albums and 2 cars
Now bitches on my dick cause of chico debarge
Thugged out's 1st lady (let's go half on a lady)
Ya motherfuckers ain't live, don't control the streets
I sold 163 thousandon my 1st week
That means I got more fans than you
Bigger plans than you
We buy real coke, your grams is blue
Ai yo, the president is like me, he smoke weed too
Don't really like to fuck, he just get he'd too
Stick a broom in your butt, tell you, go head boo
Thugged out motherfuckers like the rest of the crew
Canibus, cam'ron and punisher too
And the beats are usually done by duro and clue
Who in the hell wanna battle, the I'll mathematical?
My motherfuckin' brain is IBM compatible
Techniques are foreign
Far from being borin'
My style is hard like cancer without mccorman
I run threw your crew like the flu when I bomb it
My styles like aids cause don't nobody want it
Niggas frontin' like they hard
But I'm a street fighter like jean claude
And I'll split your shit, god
Right down the middle
Play you like a riddle
I got a fetish for titties, I nibble on the nipple
Then trespass on your property like monopoly
Subdue your crew and beat that ass properly
Welcome to the desert storm annual extravaganza
Clue rolls deeper than the cart-rides on bonanza
I feed off weed, natural energy sources
Lyrics with more power than the horses they put in porches
Can't be tested or f'ed wit
I'm too reckless
I chop off heads just to take the necklace
The type of canibus that's side effectless
The type of shit that get the question-mark man arrested
Take evasive action
Flip like reciprocal fractions
Turn the heat up on mcs to watch their meat blacken
You try get fly, you get electrified and fried
Fuck around and get your mouth slapped dry
You could battle me and possibly survive
But you could never see me and walk away without a black eye
Word up hop, clueminat call the cops
And if the cops ain't tryin' to see me, then the cops call swat
Scar your whole squad with bullet scars
No holds barred
I'll even hassle the national guard
Ready or not like the fugees
Crews be steppin' to me
But I wipe em' all out like booty
I'm so unruly, the police don't say nothin' to me
It don't matter whether they on or off duty
I murder you brutally when I spit at you
My actions are unforgivable
Look at what clueminati did to you
The maximum lyrical
Nigga you minimal
There's a big hole in the desert, I told the men in blue to dig for you?
Motherfucker clueminati 98'",https://genius.com/Camron-fantastic-four-lyrics

Guitly like O.J. I'm defending you like Cochran (Pffftss)
I bought you them lavish VV's that were sickening (Sickening)

There's nothing you can do about it
Oh don't cry now

No panties....freaky....nasty....porn star
I be at the club ballin....All-Star
Wit more bottles at my table than a Sports Bar
It look like we at a ""Champagne Campaign""
We do the damn thang and you won't do a damn thang!
2 steppin, bytch I got my new Airs on
I been fly since a baby....I was ""Air Borne""
Lookin at me is like lookin at a Lear fly
I'm so fly I'm bout start my own airline!

You feel the love is gone
'cause we don't get along
But I can prove you wrong
Girl I swear
'cause everytime I close my eyes I see you
And how I wanna live my life with you
There is no one
You're all I need and all I want
The only one I'll ever love

In this relationship we spend alot of time
Now it would be wrong if everything was always fine
Girl, I know we've had our share of ups and downs
But it doesn't mean that we can't work this out
Oh baby girl, I care, yeah

Ya stomach catch butterflies

That take trips uptown just to cop his haze
I rep for them chicks givin brain in the rain
That ain't scared to be a freak, for the right pay

For buryin they boys to soon for this game

And I fouls with this, you can have my ass to kiss
But when I seen ya baby mama, had to ask her this...


I clean up well, loafers down to moccasins
Back up off me, baby girl, I need some oxygen
Yeah, I know, I know, I'm Mr. Get It Poppington
But every time I see you coming, I'm like not again
Chill girl, chill girl, I'm done, I ain't got more to give
You can't cross the line, cause I let you cross the bridge
It's blood banks, it's weed spots
You can make 100 an hour sucking three cocks

You got 3 dollars, good, bitch, spend soon
