Vice City,90059,2015.0,"Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
Big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit...

Turn me up
Sin City, Sin City
Sin City, Sin City

Big money, big booty bitches
Tell the truth, nigga, I'm lost without it
7 figures for a headline
You want some stage time? We can talk about it
Niggas actin' like they be rappin'
Like nice on the mic, truly doubt it
Go against the kid, y'all don't wanna live
That decision is hella childish
Rose gold for my old hoes
They ain't satisfied then I sit 'em down
10th grade, I gave her all shade
But now she got some ass, I wan' hit it now
I don't lease, I just all out feast
I put a blue Caprice on Gary Coleman
Bomb head and some cheese eggs
That's a new raise and a signing bonus

Fall in this bitch
Like some good pussy—can't stand myself
So good, she so hood
She a cheesehead, patty melt
GED with some EBTs, and some DVDs
That shit was happening
She reel me in with some chicken wings
And some collard greens, that shit was brackin'
Just cracked me a new bitch
Bust a new nut on her nigga's jersey
My bitch get off at 9 o'clock
So I had to shake her 'round 7:30
105, I'm stomping fast
With these big guns, I'm hella dirty
Get caught with this shit
I ain't comin' home 'til like 2030

I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might ban myself
I just might... God!

I'm focused, feeling blessed
'Cause my eyes be the truth
I'm focused, feeling blessed
'Cause my eyes be the truth

Mental window blurry as a bitch
Still lookin' out it
So much money off the fuckin' books
Could write a book about it
Took a minute, no, wait a minute
Let me think about it
Bout ten years, Crips, Bloods
Sweat and tears, and we still counting
Had a real thick bitch named Brooklyn
She fucked the whole squad
Now every time I land in Brooklyn
They fuck with the whole squad
I'm more spiritual than lyrical
I'm similar to Eli
Why? 'Cause I'm wearin' black shades
And I'm headed west with the word of God (Amen)
Yeah, I think I'm finally ready to talk about it
These niggas just talk about it
Homie don't play me for no fool
Poppin' bottles like enemigos
Os dios mio, I'm so cold
Get so deep in that water, water
They should call my johnson a harpoon

Feed the needy, don't know graffiti
Paint her walls like a cartoon
Beat the pussy up so bad
Send her home with some war wounds
Loaded off the 'gnac, hit her from the back
Goin' 'cross her head, bar stool
Touch her soul, 'til I curl her toes
Then it's time to reload, then it's part two

Damn near 30, still set trippin', cuz
Where you from? I'ma see about it
Last year I made ten million
That's where I've been, yeah, a private island
Smoking something, on autopilot
Got too many cars, I might crash a whip
New 'Rari pedal barely tapping
Nigga, vroom-vroom, yeah, I'm rich, bitch
Got two rollies, but one missing
Think my daughter flossing, she in kindergarten
Got one crib worth two cribs
And my front lawn, yeah, that's water fountain
You be talking boss, saying big words
Like philosophies, man, you weird homie
What it sounds to me that you broke as fuck
And your bitch gon' leave, and that's real, homie

I got big money, big booty bitches
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big problems, I must admit it
Man, that shit gon' be death of me (death of me)
Big dreams, no superstition
That shit gon' be the death of me (death of me)
I pray to a C-Note, my mama gave up hope
I can't stand myself
I just bought a new coat, I just might go broke
I can't stand myself
I just might damn myself
I just might... GOD!

Hood Gone Love It,Follow Me Home,2011.0,"Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)

Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me ""Keep it pushin'!""
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga

Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)

From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
(Huh?) And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost (huh?)
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up,  drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right

Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)

You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it (Hey)
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public (Hey, hey)

The home girls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esse's at arm reach; one West

Keepin' it G ain't nothin' (Hey)

Who won? We won, yeah, holmes
We old school like Capitol
My old school made doctor note

Called Big Ten on a island bashful
Fuck your plan, I'ma burn that castle
Fuck that clan, I'ma burn that task force
It's sick murder when I say go
Hoppin' out that van with the black ski mask
And a great big burner when I say go
Man I took my chance in the paint like that
Let's see how further it might go
And it just might hurt you when I go
And my name might curse you when I go, bitch

God, we trust
Fear no man but in God, we trust
Both palm in hand, prayin' I stay up
I know you try your best but it's not like us, wow

Out of mind, out of sight (Out of sight)
Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

Sometimes a nigga feel like
Everybody ain't real like Johnny McKinzie
If I could pretend, see, I wouldn't feel right
I bought a Dodge Magnum
I just got signed, everybody on my line
They wanna know the taxes
Do Rock got a mansion? 30K to my moms
The hood turnt up, bitches, bottles, dope and all that stuff
For attention, high hopes and call my bluff
Offended by the notes when I lost love
Things change, people change, niggas change
Bitches change, friend or foe, if or so, pick a lane
Lil Wayne on my single now
Fuckin' hoes like I'm single now
Triggers close to my fingers now
But when the label frozed up, they all chosed up
They tellin' me you a non-believer now
A felony all I could think about
The cars got repoed, the bills they add up
My bitch done left me, I smoked my last one
I'm high with no sleep, I pray a bag come
I just might grab one, I just might blast one of you
'Cause I ain't got nothin' to lose
But I got these wins to gain
And I don't feel comfortable
One thing that I've learnt all of these years
Is to block devils off of my ears
'Cause fairytales don't end well
When the fame and fortune not here
Everybody!

Out of mind, livin' life
Like I'm runnin' out of time

Promethazine in a baby bottle
Meditatin' on daily dollars
Lately problems stem from my bitch
'Cause she know I still fuck with my baby mama
So there be drama in the house, I gotta find a outlet
Waitin' on a plug just like a fuckin' outlet
Fuck it, I'm turnin' my phone off
Fantasies of grabbin' the heat and burnin' my nose off
Blaow! Niggas might not know but I'm slightly throwed off
And I might need Zoloft, but for now, these Xannies'll do
Hear the sound, a 
manic depressive
That ain't been prescripted, what can he do?
Anywho, boy, when you got it, you keep a close watch
On the ones that's befriendin' you (Friendin' you)
Them'll be the ones that's envy you (Envy you)
Vividly dreamin' 'bout endin' you (Endin' you)
But when you low, they don't tend to you (Tend to you)
Actin' new when they run into you (Into you)
Fuckin' your bitch tryna feel like you (Feel like you)
This the message I send to you

Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Look both ways)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Hmm-mm)
Look both ways before you cross me, I tell ya (Hmm-mm)
Look both ways 'cause if you cross me, I kill ya

Rippin' and runnin' wild
My momma say, ""Slow it down"", I don't listen to her
All of my felonies on file, sippin' liquor 'til my liver ruined
My partner just lost trial
This system'll give it to you when you gettin' to it
How could you calm down?
Cause soon as your guard's down, it's a pistol to it
G-ride special, it's a Buick
I'm guilty but I said I didn't do it
Pressure bust pipes like a gunfight
I ain't never bring a knife to it
I done been through it and I been through it
All the rah-rah, I'm in a high rise
Instead of music and the interviewin'
I could be a nigga dead in a viewin'
Would you take a look inside of my eyes?
I'm surrounded by a bunch of blind guys
Out of sight and out of my mind
But y'all can never see me, checkin' chicken fettuccine
And I wish a nigga would when I'm in this Lamborghini
Top back in the bity, top down on a Bentley
Top Dawg's on the map
We familiar with your ways, we don't even need the app
Sorry but I gotta ask, you runnin' the trap or just runnin' your trap?
I'm runnin' amok, I'm runnin' it up, runnin' across the finish line
Hope you worth more than yo' Rolex
When you run up out of time

Pay for It,UnKnown,2014.0,"Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it

It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road
No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it
You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo
I keep it cool to keep from goin' coo-coo
With a cal', aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way
I won't let up, I won't shut up
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written
In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen

Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it

I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
Been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent, then — cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew
And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
See? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
See? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God

When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive

I gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight
I got to eat 'til it shows on my face
Tragedy turned to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate
Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith
Playin' at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupils'll dilate
Their speakers'll vibrate
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum
I come from the slums, we come for the funds
Like run it, under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
Countin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds
Keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, Look, I'm runnin' through it
Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy
This my gutter fluid, nothin' to it
What we lost, we gon' make it back
Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that

Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-pay-for-it-lyrics
Easy Bake,90059,2015.0,"This shit is fresh out the oven
Fresh out the oven

I'm back in this bitch, nigga you know what's up
Stackin' my dividends
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin' with
Highly belligerent
But that's way before the liquor hits
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now
Lookin', lookin', she tryna sabatoge my thing
Never go brazy when you're deep inside the pink
I'm lowkey like a drug dealer
So don't snitch, my nigga, get your chips, my nigga
Mind your business, I minds mine, let's get rich, my nigga
Take our family on trips, my nigga
But if you try me then your wig I'ma split, my nigga
And I ain't tryna kill my own kind
But we always losin' to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie
And they wonder why us niggas always get high
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly
Another thou-wow on it just to get by
Fuck it, only got one life to live
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like

What? This shit is fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin'
Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'

I pull up and park, hop out and swag
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch
There's repercussions, and concussions
You know what's after that, end of discussions
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'
Could it be some intervention on some inner vision?
I don't know, 'cause I'm just goin' with the flow
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low

Ah, I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosie
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
And I don't do trends
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
We'll give 'em blues then
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby ""Blue"" Bland
Aye you a fool man
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
Baby come and get your blessin'
And she gon' fuck with this erection
I got somethin' good for all these hoes
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes
Now if I paid for your dress and your perm
That means you an investment, bitch
I'ma need my dough in return


We reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch

Itchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface
I ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none
You can find me where
The sun don't never end and the waves don't part
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I don't wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower
Dirty for you

Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there
We 4 deep at a swapmeet, don't need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle (No cuts)
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too brazy
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott free",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-easy-bake-lyrics

On the road to Damascus, gun and a suit
You either coming with some products or you coming for loot
I’m coming with the peace so I’m chucking the deuce
I ain’t tryna run a train I’m just in the caboose
And I’m tryna give these niggas the truth
I ain’t ‘bout to spazz on ‘em, give ‘em light
I’m just doing my Zeus
Rubbing on her body just like a masseuse
And it’s money like a hobby for you to seduce
But if you blink twice nigga you can Medus'
See the snakes in here, look there's hate in there
I pray that you niggas all playing fair
You can’t help but stare as you face the glare, yeah
I’m not up on in short yellow
With a helmet on my head while I’m eating marshmallows
Playing jigsaw while I’m picking off devils
I can rock this shit on all levels

I’m going hard ‘til they free us

Have you ever put your hand over fire
Just to see what you could tolerate?
And you can find no escape
Life is a Dominatrix waiting for shit to pollinate
To make you mind your mistakes
Keeping my chin down, nose clean, with my guards up
Charged up ‘cause this ghetto got me scarred up
Yes, I’m the child with the crookedest smile
Look at my foul, look at what the star bucks
You can’t swim if you don’t paddle
Wake up in the morning with my nose to the gravel
Bloodhound, for that federal reserve note
That’s when I noticed the switch, niggas is turncoats
It's the way of the world, carry the weight of the world
Carry a blade too, for they forsake you
Yeah, I’m the vision, from the night I was born
To be the eye of the tiger in the eye of the storm
Eye on the clock, ain’t no need for alarms
Just get on your A-game when it’s time to perform
Yeah, and I can show you what it feels like
The moment they want you defeated but yet you still fight
So what it feel like?

Moonwalkin' fast, y'all respect my journey
Evil tappin' in like the feds was watchin'
No album, no dope, I was all out of options
I'd rather rob than get a job, don't insult me
Remember it was nicks and dimes in '03
I was doing bad so I took your bag
Tables turned, lessons learned, karma come back fast
Flipped off that bitch, Milly Rockin' the wheel
Two hundred thousand in the bank, straight to hospital bills
Mama still got the shakes, prayin' I'm all right
Dreams of enemies in the lobby when they hit the lights
So many niggas be wishin' they was you, bro
Same niggas that hit you with that, ""I love you, bro""
Tread softly, see the snakes comin', I pop 'em off me

Tell me you a real one, bitch, where?
Tell me you gon' kill some', bitch, where?
Say you in the field, huh? Bitch, where? (Erehw, hctib)

Battle scars and tribulations, downfall from the situations
I bounced off with dedication, accounted for my participation
Gettin' pounds off, gettin' rounds off, gettin' blocks back I facilitated
When I sound off, you a groundhog, that's a casket and a pillow waitin'
Magic in the dope spot, four chickens, that's Popeye's
More spinach, that's Popeye, four women sippin' Mai Tais

Free Shooter Ray from the five line

Been a nuisance to my OG's, got a new sense, 2018
Put that on the bloodiest, whip clean on the bloodiest
Bitch clean on the bloodiest, pull up, I'ma fuck with it
Slide in for the tape deck, got a best friend, she say less
Fake threats, I'ma fade that, either pay checks or I pay debt

Broken bones, internal bleedin', stretched on the table
Goin' through surgery, two machines helping me breathe
Sorry mama, I wanna stay but I gotta leave
I see my funeral packed, I see some lyin'
Some cryin' and some givin' dap
I see false claimers, strangers and foes with they head in they laps
I see mo' division
I see some of them showin' up just to post a picture
Like they was my nigga, Instagram's a dead man's best friend
Everybody lookin' for likes but wasn't likin' you when
You needed somethin' to hold on dealin' with life stress
Glad them angels came in surgery, said I'm not done yet!

It's a millions of miracles
Show me the real you, the real truth

If I had a second chance in life, this what I'd do
I buy you flowers talk to you for hours, give you truth
I listen to you when you're hurt
I shoulda went to church with you
But my credentials didn't work, I still should've worked with you
I should've left them lil' hoes alone and came home
But I blamed the moments on you, though I was in the wrong
You checked my phone and I checked you 'bout it
We never talked it over, instead we just sexted 'bout it
I said, ""I'm comin' over"", you turned up and flexed about it
I hit yo mama phone
She said, ""Y'all get it together"", she don't know what we on
My response was whatever, I'm ego trippin' however
I hate to see you gone, she gave me that dial tone
I should've gave you more trust, more love, no lies, more us
'Cause when my motorcycle crashed and everyone left
You was that angel at surgery sayin' I ain't done yet, real shit

These streets make it so hard to breathe
Highs and my lows
Look both ways, where I'm supposed to go
Ah, shit, get out my pocket

The stench from the smoker's smoke, so ferocious
Winos in the alley, nearly slumped over
Demons in they eyes, glassy, no Folgers
Wake up sober, kill you for a cold one
Snotty nosed rascals, big ratchet toters
Give it up slowly, click, clack, it's over
Something like Velcro, stay attached to corners
Hood rats plotting, riding for the blue cheese
All for the Gram, grams and a new weave
All they got is spandex pants, and some loose knees
Niggas taking chances, tip-toeing with two Ps
No one's exempt, weak or strong they do bleed
Candle light vigils, closure if they do leave
Bullets have a name defined by different calibers
Concrete jungle, beware of different challengers
Gotta have the stomach for dookie bags and catheters
Play your cards right or be scratching off them calendars

Highs and my lows

These waters are murky, crocodiles they lurking
Murder rate merging, up and down, burpies
Guess you gotta play street versions of a surgeon
Keep beat bursting, closing down all your curtains
When shit don't go right, gotta question your purpose
Denim with them serpents coming back to surface
EBT, zero balance, worthless
You either leave in limousines or them hearses
Too much bad blood, another problem emerges
You started the problem you motherfucking deserved it
Politicking, a lot of liquor, that be the answer
They Marlboro, trying to trick them, they be the cancer
Gotta get that loose change, 
you gotta kick a nigga brain
Like your name Liu Kang
, 
that be the mantra
Stop, look, listen, that's the words to live by
Know you gotta stake your claim, like a rib-eye

Ah, shit, get out my pocket
Get out my pocket

A force from the rap game my nigga, this ain’t a circus
There’s no Ringling Brothers, no Barnum and Bailey
Clowned ass niggas get marked out daily, trucked out lately
Bitch niggas get they hat brought to them, you don’t communicate
Well hands and the gat talk to you, what’s the convo?
Don’t think fast, you end up getting a combo
Think situations is calm, then they bomb though
Sleeping in the bando, it’s either death or jail
Something you never planned for,
 
dreaming about Lambos
Wake up shivering, pillow next to a lamppost
Straight up out the motherfuckin’ crockpot it’s Watts
One stops leave you with dope, socks is not boxed
No rats, re-rock—that got them all losing weight
Got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot
Gotta call up Dr. Dre just for the detox
All of this in one zip code, keep the streets hot

The ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Oh my, my, oh
Oh my, my, oh

I was on the block right, wasn't in my right mind
Just a young nigga hustling, tryna get mines
Movin' with the 9 double M
Niggas like, ""You don't really wanna fuck with him""
Yeah, young teenager, infatuated with paper
Yeah I had to get it cause momma, she wasn't able
Black and white TV set, no cable
40's in the fridge, chicken noodles on the table
I wasn't born with a silver spoon
Child of the ghetto, raised off a different tune
Watching Bob Barker in my living room
If your price was right, I could get you a whole living room
Yeah, them was my gutter ways
Back in the gutter days, no education but the gutter pays
Through it all, I came a long way
From selling the yay, fistfights to gunplay

In the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
G-ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
I comes from the bottom but now I’m on top
Ain’t nothin' gon' stop me, yo
I comes from the ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto
Where all of my niggas, where all of my niggas
And all of my niggas will roll up in the spot
And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

Yeah, times is hard as it is
That's why I got guns and my guns got kids
That's why I be going so tough on them hoes
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold
Fuck with a nigga, let's go fuck with some hoes
Hear them bitches screaming like they stuck in a hole
I am not a demon but was once a lost soul
'Til I found myself a block away from the crossroad
I have, outgrown the fishbowl
And now I'm on my feet like a fucking insole
And yeah it may hurt like a fucking lymph node
But it's fuck the world like a fucking nympho
And we spend dough cause we make more
And I make sure when I say so
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more?

And get ghetto, ghetto, g-ghetto

Jay Rock still that same OG
I ain't tryna see the grave or the penitentiary
Everyday living, tryna stay on my feet
Even though a nigga paid but my heart in the streets
See my dogs, I'm a beast, so hard on these beats
So my family can eat, I'll be damned if I see no income
Here come Jay Rock, they know
Crack music, drug kingpin flow, oh

Kingpin ho (Yeah) need I say more? (Yeah)
Your family could die, when I say go (Go)

Take the rubber off, there's more passion you could explore""

You know I gotta eat to feed the family
Okay, let a nigga try us, bus em' like they transits

I rhyme like I got pollos in that Volvo
Shit, I switch up, whippers can't get caught, that's a no-no
So watch out, the paparazzi takin' photos
Got this world around my neck, keep my thoughts above my head
Down to ride for my respect, I'm a savage for that bread
Shake ass, baby you know I'm worth it, nobody perfect
Just look beneath your surface and I'll bet you'll find that purpose
Yeah this hustle is poetry, money don't grow on trees
So much to oversee, in this world that belong to me
Big butts and ashtrays, lookin', smellin' like potpourri

Back in the projects
I lost it all, all, all, all
Now I'm back in the projects
I can't get all of you in it

Big slugs, hardcore drugs
Everything crooked, what you thought this was?
Steam pot, turned powder into rock
Plan go sour, that's how you get got
Aww shit, got it poppin' into bricks
Part of playing cool now it's time to get rich
Keep in mind, never walk 'round blind
I can't get all of you in it

All that back and forth gets me hot sometimes
Wanna see somebody get knocked out, just box one time, shit
Catch a fade, catch a fade, it ain't nothin'
Get your head up, at the gym, bring your knuckles
Look, I'm deep inside the projects where it's brackin' at
You know the zip
Where we take a quarter piece, flip it, 'til the corner lit
A1 yola, that fresh over the border shit
Shoot outs and abortions, situations so unfortunate
I knew a nigga, doin' double digits, bust the head wide
For another nigga who's scared to rep his set right
Now in solitary, doin' push ups by his bedside
All he want is a Green Dot, his homie keepin' himself fly
Don't come around without your pass, niggas on they tip
Zero tolerance on niggas money, niggas want they shit
Don't start nothing without your blower, that's a one way trip
Six feet under, real life, that's all gunplay is
That is that hood shit
When young niggas on that misunderstood shit
Jumpin' out of smokin' rentals, Ks with the wood grips
Bitches for them bank statements will come and hit a full split

Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
Don't you know no good, don't you know no good bitch?
I can't get all of you in it

Niggas jaw-jacking, they ain't on that hood shit
Bitch we 'bout that action, on that wish you would shit
All red flags, swag on ten
We ain't in the club, we can't get our goods in
So we in the hood, lituations look grim
One time circlin' for colors of your skin
Black lives matter out here, no way
Cops get promotions while the family gotta pray
It's fucked up, can't explain, babies all in a dump truck
It's all about that money mane, miss me with that Trump stuff
Tryna make a dollar outta fifteen, don't get fucked up
It's shake in the bag, get a bud then you lucked up
You fakin', you mad, you got a issue, you get fucked up
Get laid on yo' ass, you feeling bad, your blunt's crushed up
We in the set, just bickin' it like the Cosbys
Tryna get dope, live happy days like Chachi
If you get a call from papi, that's like Jesus callin'
All you do is execute, next ten seasons ballin'
You can get the world, stay loyal, why you even trip?

Fly on the Wall,90059,2015.0,"Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away
Fly away, sometimes I wish I could fly away

There was a young ghetto child going wild after running 'round
Who came from a happy home, then got lost in the jungle
Hit a lick for like ten chicks
Brought it back to the bricks then got everybody rich
Started his own clique, recruited all piranhas
His favorite phrase: that's on Hunters
His niggas trained to go
Wherever he point, you got shitted on
Or smoked like a joint
Here comes the line-up, first 48 people remain silent
All his goons still remain violent
Damn, there goes another body, oh shit, sirens
Another bite the dust like Mickey Thompson tires
Lights flashing, niggas stunt like the grammys
No one’s exempt, they’ll sell a rock to your granny
Now 
here is
 the part where jealousy comes out here to play
Hood politics official when they want you out of the way
Now back then we ain't never mention this word
‘Cause if you caught snitching consequences fo sho
Niggas'll throw you out on the freeway with a shell in your dome
And no feelings is shown
Then look inside the eyes of these killers
A blank stare, that's stiffer than stones
Got you wondering, where in life, where they went wrong?
Don't wanna cross these types, if you do think twice
It's life saving, don't get caught slipping when you ice skating

When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall
When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall

Now when the sun rise, this young man sees money's a big deal
New Chevelle,  wipe in the morning dew cross his windshield
Killer's saturation while the smokers run through sanitation
For the bags of hands, this young man, calculating for the long run
Since ya homies been on one lately
No one's safe, he keeping his chrome off safety
Headed to the function, momma's gone, they children out cussin'
See this young man hit this bitch for all them niggas she fuckin'
Knowin' one man's been intimate touchin'
Til the big homie found out, gave his ass a concussion
He don't want nothin' now, he walkin' on crutches now
Couldn't see him from the shoulders
He thinkin' how can he buck him down
Hold up, the eyes is watchin'
Gotta be more smart now, devise this option
Watch how the plot thickens
The clock tickin', his weak spot is a thot
Just notice he can't stop trickin', got him
Now this how it starts
He take a bat when he know to go play with his heart
Had his nose wide open while gettin' head at the park
She set the GPS location like this where we park
Now you know what's next
It's crazy how life can end all through a text
Got us wishin' we was all born with a vest
I know you prolly witnessed it all
But picture the vision from the fly on the walll

When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall
When you stand still you could witness it all
Picture the vision from the fly on the wall

Jay Rock what up though? I'm here with you
Let's give 'em a classic, you know I’m here to prepare it with you
Keep niggas inspired, you know I'm comin' to share it with you
And when the wheels fall off I'll get out and put on a spare with you
Let me be real with you, mhmm
It's been selected, let me give you my fly on the wall perspective
Sometimes niggas don't listen, I'm hopin' this serves its purpose
Cause that's some of the realest shit that you talked about in them verses
Hopin' they feel this shit despite how the devils is workin'
To avoid tellin' on myself, I try to speak in third person
See we done been through some shit, throughout my lifeline
We was flies on the wall too from the shit we seen in our lifetime
And through these songs there were digressions
Some stories we shared through music
Question if we in our right mind
Now I'm a new fuckin' fly on the wall
I wanna see how many rappers really write rhymes
And we've been rockin' for a long time, Jay Rock
They ain't got a clue of the timing
I heard about you from Slay when you started shinin'
They ain't knowin' this our fourth collab from 2009 and
Slay heard about you from my nigga Wack
But they ain't know when Top Dawg introduced you, nigga
The way we out, we always give you crack
Not knowin' that we had the raw just to split you, niggas
To tell the truth there's no problem we can't solve
So let me tell the truth, again I'm so proud of how you evolved
And while me and Jay Rock kill these niggas 'til they dissolve

And put my feet to the metal in life to see just how fast it goes
Fuck the world, gotta make that bitch grab her toes
And Rock game never goofy, no weapon shall prosper
Maneuver like I'm Bruce Lee, ya know I'm chucks

Banging for fifty cent from a victim, while my gun tucked

Try'na run up in some bitches who fertile, woah
Feel like this is my moment, feel it's time for change
Exercise some game, niggas vibe done changed
No looking back at it, cause this is that moment
I step forward ready to go at each and every opponent
Give it to anybody that want it
Represent the underdog, training in the gym
Till the minute they get they number called
I'm speed bagging this work, the trainers see me smashing
With perspiration on the back of my shirt, making them sweat
Better yet, just look at them vexed
Like when I’m in that NiX, cashing a check
You know it’s real nigga

The struggle is real, the struggle is real, the struggle is real
You gotta do what you got to just to get over the hill
When you live in America, either kill or be killed, yo

Lord have mercy, have mercy
I know I ain't living right and know I'm not perfect
But plus I gotta eat what I'm doing it's worth it
So, Lord have mercy",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-necessary-lyrics

Politickin' on the yard, drop your ass off a tier
I don't trust nobody but my daughter and my shotty
If it blasts, that's a bag, if he live, for the body
Two door seats, you know me, windows tinted so the law don't see
I like top when she all on me, panties drop when they call on me
Skin-tight fade with the red Cortez
Clip ain't in but it's one in the head
Girl don't play with it, heard what I said?

Off the porch, tendencies, two for one, ten a piece

Gangbang murder state

(What's up, Jay Rock?) Shit, just the same old same old
Same fiends in the hood, chasing the best dope
Project hustling, chasing them pesos
It's a struggle everyday, man, you know how this shit goes
But my demeanor'll never switch, cherry red beamer
Gangbanged the fuck out, red rag around the nina
No doubt, I'm living it
Been claiming the set since the year found Snoop innocent
Slanging hard rock when the rap game was ran by Timberlands
The cortez is back, where's my strap?
Lemme put a hole in 'em, and what's concealed in the black denim
Will rock 'em to sleep like I babysit 'em
I seen it all - loyalty, betrayal, envy
My close homie died in my arms
12 hundred project units under the sun
Ain't about where you at, it's about where you're from

Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
If you're prepared when it go down
Then you know it's Jay Rock turn now

The homie told me, ""Put your feelings aside""
But since I got signed I been feeling the Vibes
Niggas play the background and screw they face all day
Wanna walk in my shoes, wanna take my place
So at any given time they might take my life
So I take the .38 when I ride at night
Broad day, no exempt, niggas kill you when the sun is out
Make sure your gun is out or stay inside your mama house
It's that real, you don't feel me yet?
Fine, niggas, drop the beat and just let me vent
No mask on, fuck around and kill your whole squad
Be the last person you see before you meet God
Keep the rifle on top of the tripod
Aim art, if you live your body might need parts
Jay Rock, putting it down for Top Dawg
From the bottom to the top, we shooting straight to the stars

Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya
You ain't prepared when it go down
You already dead right about now
Welcome to Watts, California
Where we ain't scared to run up on ya

Broke +-,Redemption,2018.0,"Yeah, yeah

Can I do my shiznit? Can I be specific?
Can I chase this grip without lookin' too big for my britches?
Am I too prolific? The vision, my pugilistic moods insisted
Food come from them tools, he's so choose to use
Now Harriet Tubman say she freed a thousand slaves
Could've freed a thousand more if they was aware of the chains
What's under the rugs remaining unexplained, truth is mostly taboo
Even when it's starin' back at you like an enemy tattoo
Refusin' to play the statue, I take action, without quittin'
Until I reach my point of satisfaction, not givin' a crap what happens
I'm just a part of a winnin' family, call me Marlon Jackson
As I'm workin' hard to get my spin right
Morphine and novacane dull the pain, still don't change the diagnos'
Pessimistic thoughts, curin' the bricks, we tryna find some hope
Most my counterparts be feeling the same, give me a light, let's smoke
You either chasin' this dirty money, or living righteous broke

B is for the blood, R is for the ropes
O is for oppression, K is for the kush, need it just to cope
E is for the evolution, it's for this resolution
Now have you ever been broke, sick of forever losin'?

The damage is done but who's to blame? Finger pointin', namin' names
Nobody willin' to pay that full admission to ride the gravy train
Death is a part of life, happens daily, gotta face the pain
I be limpin' through it with lacerations, both my ankles sprained
Can't rely on politics or that 1 percent to gain power
Daily givin' kibbles to let 'em own your life for 8 hours
Poison get to waters, make it hard, safely take showers
Nobody put in place to keep it straight so now we slang powder
Chasin' paper, aimin' lasers at the opposition
Can't play with these streets and say you positive, it's a contradiction
I ain't have no pot to piss in, had to make some tough decisions
Tired of dealin' with these broke conditions, listen

B is for the blood, R is for the ropes

This my testimony, look I got that recipe now
Keep that good book on the dash with that weaponry out
Ain't no mo' rules in this game plus no referees out
All that stressing, it taught me lessons
Caught blessings, went back to stressin'
And that moment when death is present
Had me praying and asking questions
I had no answers so I had to bottle up that aggression
Load up them hollows and I had to follow in my direction
Don't know where I'm headed
I can't look back though, there's nothing there
But backstabbers, snakes that slither, decisions when nothing's fair
Keeping my faith in all, even if they come take it all
Stand on my ground, I was born to fight so I'm taking off
Me and my champs on a mission, work with the baddest intention
Sharp as a scalpel incision
Gotta survive these conditions, vengeance is like a tradition
If you practice what you're preaching might just get what you wish

Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire
I know change coming

Now we have to get whatever we after
See past the regular shit that we master
Learn to survive through love and Jezebels and street pastors
Live as free as we can cause Hell on Earth is being recaptured
I'm caught in this ghetto rapture, spirit detached
I'm smoking backwoods looking for greener pastures
Hashtag we bastards, from money change to snowflakes
The body found, a cold case, we making it out from no place
Now can you walk in these shoes with no lace?
Or push that S5-50 on shoes with no plates? I don't think so
Shit is insufficient when you think slow
That's why I keep one foot in the game like a flamingo
But here's the thing though, picking my spots yelling, “bingo""
Post it with the work, 501's with the peacoat
This ain't no New Jack City and I ain't Nino
Wondering if change gone come, but we gone see though

Never thought it would be a easy, I hope we understand that
Gotta earn it when you see me, I hope we understand that
I look up at these tennis shoes over the wire
I'm looking at these tennis shoes over the wire

What's happenin', we smashin', crashin' your hood
My nigga what's good?
Staying sucker-free, just as well as you should
I pull up in that motherfuckin' big-ass truck
What the fuck? I'm on
Where your bitch? She gone with a real nigga
I hop up out that ho asking how you feel nigga
I press blood; throw your sets up!

Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this (homie)
Poke your elbows out and swing like this
Poke your elbows out and swing like this

Whatever you want to call it
For the weed heads or for the alcoholics
Now this can be some OG low-rider music
Or you could twist your fingers up and gangbang to it

Colors,Unreleased Songs,UnKnown,"Ok now shorty had yellow
Shorty eyes brown
Shorty so gold
And so is my crown
Baby color me red
Shorty code red
And so is my flag
Purple in my bag
And shorty hair black
And so is that card
That I got in my bag
How could I go Hard from my girl in fact
I could take a ball from the world
Since the president black
I went and bought a black pearls
Like damn
And she gonna wanna see lil wayne go
She just wanna bonnafie lil wayne boe
Now or later cause me and her gonna create art together
Ohhhh
She wanna do it has we do it all night
I never blew it hurt my lung
I only look nice
See the wall black and I dress all white
Yeaaa

Mama says she love it when I'm color coordinated
So I pull up in a maroon coupe with maroon laces
In my Supras I maneuver like
MacGyver when it's time to ride
Say she always feeling blue
When he telling white lies
Rain on her window pain
All she see is grey skies
Told her hit this purple
Maybe this will ease your mind
I'm rocking purple lable
Check out my shirt design
Perfect with her purple kisses
Slack track number eight
From The Dream maybe this is something you ain't neva see
Put you in a real world
Take you out that green screen
Sippin on pink panties
In the stretched limousine
They takin off pink panties
When we hit the room please
Don't confuse me for no murderer like Norman Bates
But I'm about to kill it
Pull out the yellow tape
I'm guessing I'm a criminal
You caught up in my web
Like a brown recluse
K. Dot is a color never seen boo

She love it when I'm flamed up
Valet park the Red Lamborghini at the Grand Lux
Grammys with the red tux
She a red bone
Red manicure
Red hair
Think I like her
Might wife her in some red airs
Walk her up my red stairs
Headed to the red room
She gone yell code red once I jump in that womb
Red diamonds on my wrist, red diamonds on my neck
Give yo' ass a blood bath, if you ever disrespect
Red lobster, you a small fish walking thru my set
Red beam, I'm aiming from the roof of my projects
She know that I'm gangster, she read that I'm a prospect
Eatin' red beans, shittin' on em, ""Where the flys at?""
Red in my pupils and that's just from the contact
She wanna blow up I'm a show her where that bomb at
So baby ride with the red flow
Her face turned red soon as I said let's go

Yea Ohhh
Ohhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Yeahhhhh
Ohhhhhhh Ohhhh Ehhhhhh
Hahaha That's right baby
I'm gone",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-colors-lyrics
M.O.N.E.Y.,Follow Me Home,2011.0,"They sell out, or buy in
Put their lives on the line and call it grinding
Without a second thought, now he's doing 5 or 10
Money talks, its murder for hire hear the sirens
You smell the envy in the air, everything is fair
This is war, street dreams are made, it's not a game

Motivated by money, money is mesmerizing
Many are murdered for it while mayhem is exercising
Mighty as Morpheus, and might pay your mortgages
Plus the morgue got some more of it
That embalming fluid merging through your muscles immortal is
Philosophy rules, if your mustard is mean
Then your material views will put a misery on the broke
Majority manifests, a mission before they mope
For math we do the most, observing the optimist, opposites do attract
Operation for evil, its obvious for attack
Obedience is a must but its hard to obey
When your optics ain't saying no opportunities pay
It might be over a dice game, might be over a new chain
Might be over an old bitch, or you owe someone old change
You open for open game, then open your ears
It's not an option it's an order you get shit clear about money!

The things people do for the money
And you might just lose your soul
And some will give their whole life
For the money, yep for the money
Will you give your whole life, for the money, for the money

The negatives are normal when you knee deep
When nice sins get stabbed with a knife in or shot with a nine
The neediest the nosiest, they always trying to be friends
And if you naive you should notice all the signs
They known to turn naughty, might gain notoriety
But your nemesis is lurking through the party
No exceptions, no time to exit
Your neighbours is near, now you hearing noises
Say you got a death wish, everything is everything
Well equity is evident, find yourself establishing
Etablishment executives, street entrepreneurs
Examined in they estimate
Extracurricular drug activities the testament
Taste the work, excellent, fiends excersing dope
To the head estrogen, entertain I have a hope
Intertwined with cut throats, enter when you please
Keep your eyes open its easy to be deceived about money

The things people do for the money
And you might just lose your soul
And some will give their whole life
For the money, yep for the money
Will you give your whole life, for the money, for the money

Why the say money is the root of evil?
Because when you got too much of it
Here comes the rude and evil
So tell me why money keeps you satisfied
Do it keep food on your table, do it keep you hell-a fly?
Why, why is money always on your mind?
Because the less fortunate don't have money all the time
Why money got niggas out there doing time?
Cause snitches getting paid for police to drop dimes
Why bitches set niggas up for the money?
Pussy'll get you killed nigga don't think its funny
Why niggas sell crack to they momma for the money?
Money will have you snitching while your family be hungry
And why envy a nigga who getting money
When you got the same opportunity to get it dummy, yeah
It's just a thought for your mental my nigga pay attention
Get rich or die trying just know you can't take it with you
I'm talking money!

The things people do for the money
And you might just lose your soul
And some will give their whole life
For the money, yep for the money
Will you give your whole life, for the money, for the money
The things people do for the money
And you might just lose your soul
And some will give their whole life
For the money, yep for the money
Will you give your whole life, for the money, for the money",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-money-lyrics

I pull up on them hoes, roll my windows down
Let my music out, four 15s shake the ground
Smoking on that medical, sipping on some medicine
Top Dawg letterman, she wanna ride, I let her in
She sexy than a motherfucker, plus, she brought her best friend
I guess that's a two for one, party at the Weston
Five star suites, bottles everywhere
Wanna fuck a star on the moon? I could take you there, biatch
I got a swagger of Mick Jagger
If you want her, you can have her, I done had her, we done had her
They be shooting at my ladder 'cause I’m standing on a pedestal
She gon' give me good head just cause I’m ahead of you

Trips to Never-Neverland, smoking on Afghanistan

Just Like Me,Follow Me Home,2011.0,"How cool is gang banging?
Its love when you and your homies hanging huh
Your uncles had did it so its a chain reaction
Relate to your homies because them too are bastards
Feel that your hood color look good in Jordans
Spiking your name on the wall to feel important
Banging on niggas hope they push in line
Say the wrong street corner its go time
But ignorance is bliss because that fist is soon to turn into a bullet if that index finger pull it
Cameras comin for the footage
Channel 9 channel 11 aiming 9s mac 11's
Another baby for the reverend another casket
Taking action in a matter of a second
Nothings matters when your repping for your turf
Hold it down, have heart, put in work
That's the moral of the story, when you worried and you wicked
And your mental never get it
It's a sickness when you kill your own kind

Different names, different sides, but I can see it in your eyes
That you're just like me (that I'm) just like you
(You're) just like me (and I'm) just like you
It's up to you to decide how you're gonna change your life
You're just like me (and I'm) just like you
(You're) just like me (I'm) just like you

How cool is selling drugs?
Its love when you and yours making bucks huh?
Your uncles was hustling so its a chain reaction
Risking somebody house just to get it crackin
Now everybody see you as a d boy
You shinin bright now its hard to be a decoy
Servin the junkies to get some quick cash
To give to your momma because she doin bad
Now bitches on your dick and niggas got they hands out like you owe them something if you dont look out of nothing then them Narco feds is coming you ain't even really thiknkin cause your mind is on the money
Jealous niggas politicin', on a plot to leave you bloody
But you blinded cause you shinin Fein want another hit
So you serve him 30 mintues and he OD'd off the shit
Thats the moral of the story when your greedy and you wicked, but your mind will never get it, its a sickness when you kill your own kind

Different names, different sides, but I can see it in your eyes
That you're just like me (that I'm) just like you
(You're) just like me (and I'm) just like you
It's up to you to decide how you're gonna change your life
You're just like me (and I'm) just like you
(You're) just like me (I'm) just like you

You'd rather throw your life away?
On this gang banging shootin off your brother's face
Or perhaps living in the fast lane
Selling drugs poisoning people brains
Its just a thought but don't stress it man
Just know somebody momma out there suffering
Because she lost her baby to a stray bullet
Fell victim from all these these gang shooting, mm-mm
Man these niggas out here wildin'
All the hooting and the hollin man
You'd rather sell some powder instead of trying in college
Where is all the father figures? Either dead or locked in bondage
Your tomorrow is never promised, my nigga, I'm being honest
Better wake up fast, last of dying breed
All I do is press facts, jack
Look the moral of the story is certain hearts will never feel it
Plus they mind is really twisted
It's a sickness when I kill my own kind

Different names, different sides, but I can see it in your eyes

Before I go across your chin and he said ""not again!""
Found Jeezy in the trap he was willin' to share
He like you need these too and I was like YEEAAH!
That was the easy come up,(Cyeah) With money comin' this fast never put my gun up

Asher Roth got more bread than a little bit
Made a song when I took his scholarship
I love robbin' and I love juxin'
Get yo ass out of class

Then I kept callin him Em just to make him mad
Plies always that he got his goons with him
Caught him backstage he ain't have one goon with him

Diary of a Broke Nigga,Black Friday,2010.0,"Look inside the eyes of a broke nigga
See the stress on his face
Look at his heart, ain't no love in the place
What's on his mind? - murder, money and mayhem
If he don't see a dollar somebody visiting Satan
He grabbed his gat from under the mattress, he cocked it back
Then grabbed his gloves and a mask, then threw on his hat
Looked in the mirror and said, ""times is hard""
So hard that he got gray hair on his balls - pause
In the ghetto, you destined to fall
That's why it's a must that we ball
That's why he on the corner lurkin', waitin' for a mothafucka to slip
Soon as he see the chance, he takin' a risk
What should you do, when this nigga snatch you out of your whip
Empty out your pockets then snatch what's on your neck and your wrist---NOTHING!
Cuz when the gat in ya mouth, so speechless
Any false move and ya brains on the CE-ment
It gets gutter, when niggas starvin'
Niggas will run inside ya house, kill you on target--heartless

Give me whatever you got right now
PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the floor
Give me whatever you got plus more
When times is hard and I'm prayin' for change
My funds is low when I need some change
WOP WOP
Make sure you hide your goods when I come mista
You dealin' with the diary of a broke nigga

It's been a whole month he still ain't see no paper
Nigga losin' weight every time that he wake up
Plus, he tired of askin' niggas for favors
Cuz when they got mad they throw it back in his face
That's foul, flagrant this nigga been slavin'
In the spot all week still ain't see no paper, that's fucked up
They say don't bite the hand that feeds you but if that hand don't feed you where would that leave you?
Now that the stress come
Can't turn back the hands of time
Got him thinkin' back on what he should've done
First thing on his mind now get a gun
Shit you gotta eat, and you got a son
And a daughter, now that's two mouths to feed
And that money seems far like miles to reach
But it's right there
But his brain clouded
Life on the wrong road can't reroute it
Caught the nigga, and showed him what that heater do
If you don't feed your wolves your wolves eat you
This is way beyond a cold thriller
This the diary of a broke nigga

PUMP PUMP
Everybody lay down on the ground
Give me whatever you got right now

Everybody lay down on the floor

Numbers On The Board (Freestyle),UnKnown,2013.0,"Not wearing two chains but I keep it true
Real niggas wit me
, 
my real bitches too
Out for trump change, yea I gotta eat
Patience is a virtue something flawless gon' come to me
I'm rollin O.G. blow it out the roof
She eyeballin me, mackin hoes like CPUs
She know me, might saw me on TV too
Thuggin wit the homies tryna make it kickin' ghetto tunes
Out the gutter bitch, what your focus is?
Small time hustlin, now it's time to do it big
I want it all, fancy cars yea the newest shit
Came a long way ridin round on my Buick shit
Went by any means, who said it best?
Kobe Bryant mind state I'm shootin til I'm accurate
Can't stop it til I'm a couple million strong
Grinding to put my loved ones on in my zone
Not your average rapper, step inside my universe
Far from you average rappers, nothin is by the book
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen, show you just how to cook
This city is full of bishops, putting pressure on rooks
My vision so panoramic my brain on another planet
To reach it you gon' need more than a neurologist
Honestly to be honest, far from lyrical
Gifted with miracles when I rhyme it's a ritual
Spit it it hit you spiritual nigga
I'm planning my day to triumph
All I got is my word and my sword, choppa and bible
I pray, pray a nigga never get in my way
Cause that'll be the moment he make his bed and just lay
And now you see me shinin' perfect timing I'm a Top Dawg
I love this feelin' make a killing when I'm on tour
All my life surrounded by negativity, jealousy
(Through the mist of it all is what they tellin' me)

(Muthafuckas can't rhyme no more, bout crimes no more)
When I was in the streets I put them numbers on the board
I robbed two niggas, put they chains in the pawn shop
Got 500 spent it all on a quarter piece
Made about 1500
Them new J's was about 200
The word got back, they know I dun it
Spent a thou' on a few new drummas
Took it to them cause I knew they was comin'
Three yards left, ran through those like first and goal
Naw I'm back burnt pistol close like ""who got the dough?""
Yea, DMX of the projects
Skinny black nigga with a complex fuck your pyrex
Robbin everything no patience for the nonsense
Professor X with a tec get your mind hit
They say I rap with a chip on my shoulder
Naw nigga this the wits of a soldier
Muthafucka it's Jay Rock

To me it's all just jealousy
Don't wanna see another brother get his money
So I roll on, roll on, roll on ,roll on
Everyday stay fresh and stiffy
And oh boy your girl is out to get me
Man the streets is filled with envy
So I roll on
Roll on
Roll on

Rolling up the cronic, isn't it ironic
My money rolling like Sonic
Divas in my lap up and down like hydraulics
Got a pimp player degree but never did college
Niggas steady hating when you steady getting dollars
Got 99 issues your bitch ain't part of my problem
Used to be broke now I'm getting cabbage
Got marble on the floors in my project palace
No more crack money getting paid off my ballads
Went from dirty money to visas you see my balance
Welcome to my habitat East side gutter
I could whip you a cookie, best believe it's gonna be butter
Then I hit the club pissy drunk of that bubba
Gotta stay high 'til I die motherfucker
I'mma get this money while you niggas envy
Haters want me to schh
Then come and get me
Please

I ain't worried about these niggas trynna hate on me

Kendrick Lamar, young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain, I make sure you know my name
I'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight a's for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I ain't ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But it's a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the culdesac
You get pushed and you righteous act
It's a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live

To The Top,UnKnown,2014.0,"South Central, home of the warzone where the great thugs roam
Where we ain't promised nothing but shell-bullet wounds and tombstones
Every man for himself in this concrete jungle, jungle
Only the strong survive and the weak perish and crumble
Yeah, niggas' pockets hurting, work day and night in them drug spots
In the kitchen with them razors where the water boiling hot
Blood plus crip plus wrong sign equals a shoot-out
Then the Glock's pop then the block's smoking like a motherfucking Luau
In the projects, watched a lot of niggas, seen a lot of niggas moved out
Then mom said ''back dreaming of big ass, new house''
Then it's back to reality, smokers out back getting so high
Watching niggas kill for a salary, watched a lot of great niggas die
Code of the streets, never ever talk to the motherfucking police
If you do better have a bullet-proof vest, better guard your mouth piece
Yeah, I don't really care about what a nigga may say about me
I'mma let you speak dollars into my pockets, watch them increase

Look at you - came from ground zero to the top
Made something from nothing on that project block
Switch your hustle, no more working that dope spot
Middle finger to cops, tell 'em that we're legal now
Yes, we legal now, do it for our people now
Finally we eating now, make sure our belly's stay full

We made nothing out of something, man
You know, all the way to the top
Make sure our belly's stay full
Make sure our belly's stay full

Yeah, I got some, but I'm still on the block like a nigga never left
Still on the grind all the time, gotta get mine doing what's best
Yeah, I came up, but I never changed up on my niggas, no sir
Let bygones be bygones, let it burn like Usher
No chauffeur, I'm wheeling myself in a big '64
Rims poking, three wheel motion, my lungs full of that herb
My niggas still on the curb posted up like junkies at a liquor store
For all my niggas that died in the war, yeah dawg, let the liquor pour
Just Ciroc's, baby, hood shit is all I know
Live life to the fullest, never know when a nigga gotta go
That's how it is out here, dawg, really can't show no feel
I've never seen a man cry 'til a man dies, then you see them tears
Rest in peace, Nini, your grandson still looking handsome
Still gotta keep canons cause them haters out there still can't stand us
You said I got power, all I gotta do is grab hold to my pen
Yeah, I love you to my last breath, grandma, 'til we meet again


We're like a train with no breaks
Who gon' stop us?
Make sure our belly's stay full
Make sure our belly's stay full

Yo, Rock - let me get it, let me breathe on it for a minute
Speak for a minute, put my 2 cent in it for a second
Let them get a view of my mind, backpack tucked with a nine
Went to school with it, didn't play with it
Didn't tell nobody it was mine
It was my weapon, had it for protection
I didn't blink, not for a second
Didn't pour my heart and soul to a reverend
They're hypocrite anyway, rather put my full faith in God
Had to stay on my grind something like when I was sumping
Had to maintain my function back against the wall, they fronting
Played the background like a movie extra
Extra activities, no remedy for the crime going on, same old song
Bet ya couldn't make it out here if you wasn't wasn't that strong
Not mentally, but physically, had to get my psychology on
Mama said I gotta come home, but I didn't, stayed out real late
My excuse was ''how we gon' eat if it's no food on the plate?''

Yeah
I like this right here
See stuff like this
You just speak what you feel like
I mean you just say whatever is on your mind, like you know
When I say things, I just want people to feel me
You feel me?

Dwelling with my killers
Smoking good
Blowing on that killa
Word on the streets
Niggas wanna kill us
We got choppers
They don't want to feel it
Say they want problems
Motherfuck they feelings
Nickerson gardens
We natural born fucking killers
Bustin down birds
Tryin to get a million
But we gotta eat
Feedin all our children
Getting paper
Stack it to the ceiling
Straight gutter
Heart colder than a blizzard
Leaning of the sizzurp
Twisting up the hizzerb
Rock be the name
Game sharper than some scissors
Baby what it is?
Tell me what the wizzord
You got ass
I'm a whistle as you twizzirl
Keep it live
365
Got my chest out and my head to the sky
But

I'm so anti-social
Cause fake ass niggas I can't stand close to
Some of these niggas actin like they know you
But as the world turns only time will show you

I'm so antisocial
Cause fake ass niggas I can't stand close to
Some of these niggas actin like they know you
But as the world turns only time will show you

Looking good in my chevy
Wish my granny could see me
Rest in peace Mimi
Wish my daddy could see me
But the lord took him away
All I have now is memories to play
Can somebody tell me why the ones you love the most
Always be the ones that go
Got my gun on my shoulders and my heart on my sleeve
Make every moment count never know when your soul gotta leave
Just to escape from stress, I smoke some weed
Getting high to the point when I'm not able to speak
Fuck friends, all I have is me
Keep your enemies close
Cause family envy
That's cold blooded
That's my life and it's rough
Gat in my palm running your mouth then I'm gonna bust
I ain't a hater, my homie I don't cuff
Jealousys the root of evil
And ladies I don't trust


I just mind my business
And do what I'm supposed to, man
Represent the apple, keep it real on garageband
Why every year I lose someone that I'm close to
That's why I stay strapped in every club that I walk through
Never know, crazy whack haters might hawk you
Stalk you, spock you,
 shell put a part through
Gat in my car when I ride in the dark too
When I let it off it's a light now say goodnight (goodnight)
Is that simple homeboy
Shoot your fingers throwing up the wrong symbol homeboy
And we could clash like a thimble homeboy
Rase the bar, duck shots if you can do the limbo homeboy

You can get stretched out running the motor in your mouth

Nigga I’m 'bout that, 'bout that, 'bout that
Nigga I’m bout that, show you why I’m 'bout that
No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m 'bout that

I’m in the hood all day broken plumbing
Sew a nigga down for anything just to get some money
The homie cousin down from Oklahoma, tryna work him a spot
It ain’t gone work in his favor if I don’t see no paper, I’m mad
Frustrated, you can say doing bad
Took a loss, to bounce back, I need a brick and a half
You ain’t gon’ front me? I’m on your front steps like the mailman
Better yet your backdoor, you dead on your back porch
Cooperate or get laid down
Got nine ounces on the table, get ‘em right now
It’s cutthroat in these projects, young niggas would rob they own uncle
Blame it on the next nigga and kill ‘em when they want to
Raised in the jungle, orangutans and Rah-Rah
Twelve-year-olds hold backpacks with Blah-Blahs
You wonder why we act this way?
It’s the end of the month, you know that them checks come late!

I make everybody feel it when I’m on one
Make ‘em feel it when I’m on one
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one

I show you why I’m ‘bout that
No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m ‘bout that
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one

211s turn to a 187 in a second when I’m wildin with the Wesson
Don’t believe me? Ask the last dead nigga for a reference
Smokers up the block, with a lot, of change and shit
Need a dime, got a dub, I need change and shit
Same clothes, three days I never change for shit
Got to code a scheme to snatch a nigga chain then split
Like I catch him off guard trying to floss at the mall
Them some nice shines, nigga, take that off!
(Man, my grand momma gave me that chain)
Sometimes you got to Re-up to make that back
Got to grind overtime just to pick up that slack
I sold some to the homie momma, lost a couple customers
Narcs in V-necks fit in just to fuck with us
Identifying hustlers
Now I made small time, small nine, still ain’t slop-py
I’m strapped at the swap meet, 'cuz niggas know I bang!
Better use it, motherfucker, or I'mma bust your brain!

I make everybody feel it when I’m on one
Make ‘em feel it when I’m on one
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one

No mask, dirty pistols show you why I’m ‘bout that
I show no sympathy for no one, especially when I’m on one

Ready to rock ‘em, bring them choppers
Knock him out his Air 1’s
Pistol poppers make them helicopters into AirComm

Before I get started, let me get a rest in peace to my nigga Pac
Gotta go in on this one
Yeah, let's go

Give me my money and stacks and lace my swishas with kush, nigga
Hard liquor fuck up my liver, guaranteed I pick up
The west coast like the phone is ringing, hello
Anybody on this phone this evening? Guess not
Jay Rock, out the bottom of Watts
Gangsta, ain't shit pop but the water in pots
We cookin the crack, distributin' to the block
Gettin' it back, I use the same formula for rap
I'm warnin' ya, leavin' more dead bodies for the coroner
Shootin any witness with a cornea
As far as rap, I'm best the rapper out of California
Warrior, in the 300 like a Spartan
Gladiator, blast a hater, put em in a coffin
For coughin', that thera-flu won't do
Gonna need more if you don't wanna see the lord
Tell me what ya livin' for like 2 times 2
I'm a sureshot like marksmen, you all dead
Cold red, money clippers if a nigga fold bread
That will feed four people for the next four years
I ain't just got ends, I end careers
Cosigned by the allmighty pac when I drop science
Like? I'm not lyin'
Put a scar on your face like Simba's uncle
Dumb fuck, I was built to tussle
Gangbang, murder state, west side of the mississippi
Where you can die like a shirt from an old hippie
Peep the irony, the heater on me when it's nippy
Hit a nigga on Q like I'm from the fifties
Roll through the sixties just to fuck withNnippsey
Hussle to the death like interpreters I'm hurtin' ya
I could close curtain ya, but I'll let you bleed
I'm a top dog, nigga, like?
Got the game on lock, but I'm stealin' the keys
Don't get it twisted, honey, I'm still with the bees
Like sean carter on the yacht, what you got, nothing, nigga
Give it up, circle round the block (BUCK-BUCK a nigga)
What the fuck, this is hip-hop to the third degree
Murder emcees, send 'em up, throw 'em in a burboun truck
Throw some gasoline on 'em, light a match, burn em' up
I don't think you heard enough, fuck it, let me turn it up
Grab ya bitch, turn her out, sell her for a couple buds
Put her on a stroll, bet she'll bring back a armored truck
Tell her I'm a city nigga, gritty nigga, grimy nigga
Even when you eyes closed, guaranteed you'll find me
In the Watts with a backroad, the hood made my heart cold
Put me in a loophole, now the nigga do shows
Kick flows like I knew martial arts
Raving at Peter Parker once a nigga climb the charts
All my real niggas follow, I don't fuck with pussy niggas
Fuck with real bloods, real crips, who you foolin', nigga?
Jay Rock, jack the ripper, rep for every ghetto
I'm a still be here even when the smoke settle on a sunset
Rollin' down sunset, hand on the wheel
Middle finger to the cops, give a fuck how they feel
I'm a ride like a freighttrain on ya rap-lames
Screaming Bounty Hunters got the projects on my back, mane
You ain't gotta aks mane, Jay Rock got it
Top Dawg, aka they got dollas
Big like Chris Wallace,
 fly like weed parlors
Sig on my lap, we'll pop your collar
From the land where the coolest cat will drop your mama
Mouthpiece like barack obama, but still street
Stilll creep through your set, I'm a thug I guess
Cold stares for the clothes I dress, I'm well aware of that
Niggas be hatin', soon as they jump like a car cable
Homie gon' be disabled, screaming for help
Tryin' to kill me? Better off killing yourself, because
It's suicide
The way I was raised, either do or die
You can die any given time, it's not promised
Hop out, spray llamas, come back with the Big Mac
Hassle McDonalds on our house, what you 'bout?
Big money?, for cheap talk
Bumping your gums, you'll get your teeth lost
Play me for dumb, we bust guns, leave ya street-chalked
Do this for fun, we hit ya block, let the piece bump
Like pitbulls, get shookup when the flow cook up
Tell 'em I got the hookup like candyman on your steps
I command respect like a law permitted to y'all
Y'all never come brawl with the west coast general
Criminal background, tell mama her son rap now
No more hustling rocks up in that crackhouse
All I do is bring it to you, pay per view
Food for thought, brought wordplay, what you brought
I brought the big boys with me, my project people
Call me Bishop Lamont, stand on top of the church steeple
Writin' raps 'til my hands collapse
Starin' at the world from a different view like my crooked eye do
Hold my beach cruiser as I ride by you
With my Glasses on, shout out to Malone
Out-of-towners want to trip, then I'm ready to rob 'em
See I got that K boy, who wanna pile 'em
And that K got a Dot, if I let a shot go
Hit you in your Ab, and there go your Soul
On my misson ready to roll, let's do this to a living
But Jay said that's a felony cause niggas keep on telling
If a coward snitch on me, then this what I'll do
Pull the rocket out and let it bang loose
Then give his mama the blues, like SBI
Got hot dollars now, so the FBI
All inside of my ride, that's the Cadillac Fleetwood
If the west blow, shit, you know that the east would
I'm coastal with it, look, me and Mistah Fab
Doing fabolous digits, it's a family business
In the field with that, then you get stuck up
Give it to you every day, seven years of bad luck
Who got the gin and the juice, toss it up for my name

So I sleep with one eye open
Cause you never know when you wake up and you're gone

Now the doctors they operating pumping your heart infront of yo momma yo dogs
If you don't make it you gone
On the way to the trauma center
They taking to long swerving in and out of traffic yo mamma tell you (Hold on)
Your bodies filled up with holes
You feel your body getting colder smelling that death in the air the reaper waiting for your soul
While you’re fightin for your life, strugglin to get some air struggling to get some air yeah, when that line flat then it's a tag on yo toe
As your soul start to travel out your flesh you see yourself lying on that gurney all bloody buddy it's a mess
Wish the best upon your flesh
But your flesh might be dissapointed
Pray to god that you anointed while awaiting your appointment
While he pointing in that waiting room
Going through the motions all the screaming and comotion
As they split yo body open, for the surgery and accertainly as seems that it's over better pray that you hold over
Call your bloods how you was potent, I said maybe cause your safety is for certain out your hands
Not your momma not your daddy not your girl not your mans
None can save you hope they play you in a memory when you fly
You made but your ligaments ain't alive
Wish you had died

See out of my body's where they want me
They think they can catch me slipping they want me
So I sleep with one eye open
Cause you never know when you wake up and you're gone

Plantin' messages, punks get ahold of my voicemail
Plotting and planning damaging, on giving this boy hell
Hopped off on my boy hell
Man I hope they enjoy shells
Dropped, all up on they property
Gotta get dos when this toy yell
Nigga I ain't dying just cause you jealous
I'm gettin' relish and I sell it my shit developed
So well that a deaf dude could tell it
I smell it he female-ish
Swell up cause his gal I nail it, Spell it!
(B-i-t-c-h) but killer is the sales pitch
I'm gonna be poppin' chopping, a lot of of body's gonna dropping from this
Never gonna be another motherfucka livin' in my land when he be talking some shit
Cause I got kids niggas, and I'll do a bid nigga
But for the safety of my babies, crazy, ""Now look what I done did nigga""
Hop off my tour bus in your town I'mma scope you out
Hoping that I find you when I hear that shit that you spoke about
Like I'm goin' feel shit
Like it's gonna be a real hit
But you're just like that chick that gave you my number a little bitch
Been in your town over and over, you still absent
And I do meet and greets, nigga you for real acting
I'm sick of yo ill yapping, you gonna get your grill blackend
That's from the steel clapping that's 56 Vill rapping
It will happen, bitch!

Tolerate,UnKnown,2010.0,"Weed elevate my brain cells
Sipping liquor while she exercise her brain well
She just another chapter in my freaky tales
Shout out to my niggas trapping to get some mail
This a cold world, plus life's a bitch
Haters trying to snatch her, I better wife her quick
Mmm;
What would I be without my mic and shit
I'm on tour now what type of life is this?
This the good one, I'm so blessed dog
But why my baby mama trying stress me tho
She don't no I'm excellent, exercising these 16's
Reckless bars I'm far from a cliche rapper
With chains And Cars
So much more a child of Gods, product of these project Walls
But she praying on my down fall she wanna see me flop
While I'm In the studio grinding in the hope to see the top
She always calling my phone with Negative Energy
He say she say n*gga I Don't give damn
I'm just trying to stack a dollar, you just trying to cause a problem
Trying to use use my baby to lock me down
You full of drama! oh you got a man now, trying to throw him in my face
I don't give a damn! a gang of women want to take your place
I don't want to deal with your bullshit, drive my baby off
Tired of the fussing and fighting with you trying to throw me off
Messy hoes, messy hoes all up in my business blood
Treadmills in their mouth running like a fitness club
You don't listen and you know I got a lot to say
Theres only so much in my brain I could tolerate

I had to move on with my life
You know you ain't right, full of drama
Got me steaming and I ain't even in sauna
Throw me out, I won't even call yawl
Excuse so negative!
Bet you want to see my fall on my come up
Knock me of my swag, I swear I know you wanner!
I know you wanner (knock me of my swag)

I'm like fuck a bitch
These hoes don't know who they fucking with
Man my baby momma on that bullshit
Sometimes I want to slap the shit out of her real quick
But nawh I ain't going to do that, I'm a bigger man
And she would love to see my in that cell suffering
I look back in the bible, women is mans greatest downfall
Just look at Adam & Eve and the story about Samson you wouldn't believe
You got to understand that these hoes deceive
Trying to take my to court this girl is a thieve
Trying to take what I ear, I take care of my seed
Probably trying to take the money to buy her jeans
Now she ain't broke now because of me, ain't that a bitch
I can't let this knock me off of track
I'mma train in motion, these haters trying to derail
Still on my grind, got no chance to be real
Got to make it to Heaven, I've been going through Hell
But real n*ggas know they be hearing me from miles away
Theres so much on your brain you could only tolerate


When my n*gga introduced me to her, such a beautiful face
Like some feeling I found my soul mate
Love is blind, my n*gga seen the problem from start
I should of just followed my first mar
But I stuck around and now she had my first child
Taking care responsibility, striven to see a smile
But when the fame came, thats when she changed
She didn't think I'd be on songs with big names
Her friends in her ears (girl you know he paid!)
He got a daughter for life, you know he straight
Funny we was talking about this shit the other day
Top dog told me how these girls would play
Next day, baby momma text me, say she filing for full custody
Leaving shit on my brain to fuck with me
My momma told me God don't always like the ugly
So don't stress son you going to shine abundantly
Everything happens for a reason, If it was meant to be
It would be, we would be part of what is a beautiful seed
To clear my head, I hit the beautiful breeze
Crack afflli, then started burning the beautiful tree's
I'mma real father, I'm there for my daughter
Would give my last breathe, thats why I'm in this booth
Laying down a real, letting everybody know the truth
Go hard on these tracks, to make a way just for you
Not your mother, cause me and her days are through
If it was up to her, I wouldn't probably with you
Theres a lot of dead beat fathers on this earth
But daddy been here with you since birth
But I don't get credit for that, she ain't going to tell it
So a n*igga got to tell it in a rap
Man all my real fathers, stay straight and concentrate
Theres only such much on your brain you could tolerate",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-tolerate-lyrics

We set up shop and sling nicks out our house
If police hit, ain't shit coming out our mouths (Solid)

Lot of niggas traded on us during offseason
Get you some guala and watch how the peasants all greasy
If I could call a dead homie, I would call Deezy
He was tapped in with all the leaders that we all needed

Out to reinforce the blacktop, watch the backdrop

You ain't down to toss the dice for yourself? You side bet
We live threats, gotta flip, take it off
Fuck 'em all, gotta ball, we stuck in that mindset
And the belly of the beast is some shit you can dissect
Food for thought, this reality, shit you can digest
They feel some type of way, oh yeah, we see the curve
Ray Bans on in the summer and then we swerve

Mandatory,No Mask On,2008,"I was raised in these streets boy you can't tell me nothing
Hop out the Crown Vic' with the fo' fo' dumping
My mama said I need help my cheese slipped off my cracker
Don't bring your bitch around me, if you do I'ma crack her
The hood made me who I am so that's who I'ma be dawg
Act tough sliding the 38. to be dawg
No one hotter I got lava I pop shotties at your neckcollar
Shed down stoves to buy Prada
If rap don't work, shit, I'm back at the spot
Selling good to the fiends, selling fly to cops
Gotta watch for them raids they damage the franchise
Nowadays gotta keep the toilet on standby
You snitchin' in the hood you ain't the one to stand by
Cause you could be a target once we order this homicide
Choppers come out and all hell breaks loose
See the devil in the flesh once it's aimed at you
Shit I walk around the 'jects with eyes at the back of my head
Some niggas wanna put my lifeline in the red
I pop the pistol if it's a issue to make my hand hot
Rip the tissue, your family miss you, I make your mama cry
""Oh, that boy he gone, he ain't never gangbanged he ain't doin no wrong""
Shut the fuck up, that nigga was a killer like me
Under his belt, he had ten killers like me
Niggas pray that they can remove the sinner like me
Come through, broad day, bad bitches with me
From South Central to Queens I make them talk about me
Make sure I'm ballin' before they put the chalk around me
Till then I be on the 1-0-5 in the wind
Pistol on my lap, wanna die you can bring a friend
It's mandatory
It's mandatory, my dude, if your chain shining bright Imma blow out your fuse
Run up in your dope spot like ""Nobody move!""
Kill you right after I rob you, the unwritten rule
From South Central to ATL they talk about me
Make sure I'm ballin' before they put the chalk around me
Till then I be rollin' up chronic, sippin' Hen
Flying kites to my niggas doing life in the pen
Wanna die? bring a friend, we can make this a double date
So go round the block catchin 'em chilling and hit the brake
It's mandatory, it's mandatory that's most def
Check the murder rate, over here got the most death
Obama made president, but we still peddling
We want it in white, 100 game relevant
Carry shine don't slippin' insult my intelligence
Something in the trunk like the nuts in an elephant
Came for the paper and mayhem
Come between that, think twice get your bitch ass laid down
Mandatory!

Crown Victoria need a oil change
But I’m still feeling notorious, word to Biggie's name
Capital K. Dot
Revolutionary
Black stronger than Hancock
Hand on my cock
Fucker
The Los Angeles pitbull causing the racket
Serena Williams couldn’t even seen him in tennis practice
Fuck with the man/wolf reekening your possession
I stare at the moon and then howl no question
Homie!
This is the part where you spaz out
Like if a nigga spit in yo' mouth
Or called your momma a bitch
Now that’s some ignorant shit
I’m a ignorant nigga
Think of Bernie Mac & Richard taking pictures with ya
With the brain of a million geniuses
Fuck you, with a million penises, no homo
Fucking faggot
You sucking dick and I'm laughing to the bank, Bob Saget
Give up the chips and make the life with paralyses, chaos, havoc
Boycott who evers the best, including Khaled
I pray to God you love your success cause when I have it
You’ll never get a piece, I lay careers out in the streets
If a meteorite had hit me, I be good in a week
If a alligator had bit me, I bet he'd break his teeth
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, my dude
You a square beyond squares like a rubix cube
I would probably kick your ass but my shoes are glued
To the peddle of this vehicular Porsche I move
It’s Mandatory
It’s Mandatory, bear the glory, of a warrior, warriors state out will kill you for me
One man man slaughter tell the world to record me
I don’t care if he’s 7'6, I’ll get to him shortly

I ain’t lying, been a john since a nigga was a shorty
Young nigga smoking bub, but I’m wise like a 40
Aye rappers
You rappers are papier-mâché
Meaning I could build you up & break you down the same day
It’s Mandatory!
It’s Mandatory my nigg!
Word, sentence, paragraph, story my nigg
Fuck-niggas must fuck niggas
Cross genders
I’m psycho on the microphone
Pick up niggas

They Say,Black Friday,2010.0,"Growin up I was a knucklehead
Boy you never listen to me!
Thats what my momma said
Im from the projects
I ain't never had shit
Me and my older brother
We had to share a mattress
No heat, no lights
Had to keep them candles lit
My daddy left me at 8
In an out my life and shit
Gang bangas dope dealers replaced my father
Neighborhood hustlas taught me to get them dollars
Thats when I became a problem
Product of my environment
It's hard to grow up be a doctor or a fireman
When you constantly seein that g ride tires screeching
And them shots firin all the time it happens frequently
The hood inspired him, to be a G
I bled for the game did it all for the letter B
The big homie gave me the name jay rock
This ain't no rap gimmick
It's a real life story on watts livin nigga

You can take, me out the hood, but you can't take the hood out me
And that's the way it will forever be
And I can’t help it i’m gutter
Why should I change now
When all my life I been gang banged out
That project shit run deep in my veins now
And I can’t help it
Ooh my lord knows that I can’t help it

Let me take you on a detour
East side watts
Niggas will go in projects
Follow me home to my black and white apartments
Police roll thru with caution, scared to death
The homies got tats across them
Capitol BH over they necks
Since birth banging the set
Even the hoes banging the set
Some ain't, but most is hood rats
That looking for that buck
Them trash cans lay in the street
Ghetto technique for drive bys
For the low them 5 dollas will get you high
Dice games, YGs, fist fights
Six fo's, el co's, g rides, and mini bikes
Might see a couple of zombies late night
Off what? off pipe membrane dead right
No lie something in the bushes
Either the AK or the .45, no lie
Raised in the ghetto
With rats and roaches
Smokers on porches
Getting high off yola
It's colder north
But my city's the coldest
Where we ain't promised to see the morning, nigga


You could take me out the hood
But the hood will never leave me
I'm still bangin
I'm still hangin
The only difference is
I'm not slangin
Nickels and dimes
More like slanging these rap lines
Verses of truth
When I step in the booth
Niggas know I pour my soul out for the struggling youth
For that fatherless son who needed love so he ran with a crew
Grew up before his older brother did
Gin and juice
Replaced the pain I knew
Carrying them thangs to school
Them niggas was tripping I wasn't bangin the blue
But they had to respect me
I never ran from who?
Nobody, put my faith in god
It's amazin how I overcame them odds
On my momma this past year my life has slightly been revised
But notice I said slightly
Cuz me being absent from where I came from

Doin' 85 and the '85 Sade
In the background, got my hat down
Feeling like a king, shout out to Sac Town
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers

Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangsta in his finest hour

(Boss) Fascinated with the gold Daytons
(Ross) Fast paper was the motivation
Jay got the esés, I know the Haitians
When I'm in LA we meet at Crustaceans
Butterfly all kilos
Show me the money cause I gotta feed my ego
Fuck a Bent coupe when all my niggas' rent due
Put my life on it, I can show you how a brick move (Whip It)
Baking soda make it moonwalk
White glove money stuffed in my tube socks
Top down thug life, 2Pac
I'mma boss, I can get ya whole crew chopped
Teflon Don on the rise
After 4 or 5 lines it's organized crime (Boss)
Mo money, Mo power
The world is yours, that's until I get my lead shower

Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangsta in his finest hour

Overlookin' the skyline
Got money, wish it could buy time
Watch hustlas in they prime get confined to a 5x9, by a 5 star grind
I'm talking big money, boats and fur coats
Cars and gold ropes, scales and mo' dope
My big homie loaf, had it by the loaf
Got knocked, system tryna hang him by his throat
Downfall is when you considered the top dog
So my eyes open while I'm on top dog
Let them pussy niggas hate, I'mma do me
Fuck menage a trois, I'mma do 3
Roll up the doobie, let it burn slow
Let ya hair back, sip on this Merlot
You lookin' at a gangsta in his finest hour
Till they lock me up or rain on me lead showers

Even if I ain't got a watch on my wrist
I can still tell you what time it is
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Still hustlin' same clothes when the sun come up
Been down so long the only way is up
Cause I'm a gangsta in his finest hour
Gangsta in his finest hour",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-finest-hour-lyrics
Life’s a Gamble,Follow Me Home,2011.0,"I'm never asleep I'm on my shit dawg
Like a toddler in a craddle with a pamper on
Niggas see me and I know they plot I know the plot
They wanna see you close when you open shop
That's why I walk with the fifth when I'm on the block don't trip
'Cuz If you do there's repercussions
That's when you look over your shoulders and the reaper coming
God got some more of your people coming
Just keep them gates open I'mma keep 'em coming
They say life's a gamble and if you play
I'mma rip your poker hand to shambles

Sometime I roll the streets dolo
But don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood
Or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get
Get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)
Don't trip my nigga (don't trip keep it cool my nigga)
My nigga

Pssh just riding under the moonlight
Something illegal in the trunk not moonshine
But never mind that I got sidetracked
Got it down to a science like Sci-Fi
I can see them coming in my hindsight
Easy money fools paradise I roll with it
Like a fool with a pair of dice
Cold with it like a pack of ice
Lay you frozen on the ground
Like a snow angel, no fable
They say life's a gamble I'll noodle your ass
Like a can of Campbell's

Sometime I roll the streets dolo
But don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood
Or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)
Don't trip my nigga (don't trip keep it cool my nigga) My nigga

Some niggas shoot craps, some niggas blackjack
But me I'm in the kitchen with the flapjacks
Whip it flip it to get stacks back
Whatever the fiends need I has that
But see with that comes the hassle
The posse tryna overthrow your castle
Niggas you trained to be soldiers
Strategizing on how to take you to battle
Now that's a fucked up situation
Got you patiently waiting for the infiltration
So if you gamble with your life
If it ain't for the money do it for the right price

Sometime I roll the streets dolo
But don't trip my nigga (Don't trip my nigga)
And I don't care if you Ese if you Blood
Or you Crip my nigga (It don't matter my nigga)
Don't ever think you ain't subject to get
Get your wig split my nigga (It can happen my nigga)

Checkmate,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They say a nigga can't rhyme no more, about crime no more
About crack in my draws, and bucking that .44
Because I was with Tech on a 44 city tour
Came home for two weeks and then went back out for more
(look) ain't shit changed, same grimey ass lame
Same blood thirsty bitches seeking teeth through veins
Started off small time, penny pinching for jordans
Spinnin the wheels of life, trying to make me a fortune
Crack capsule, crack addicts black-matics
So tragic, Sunday service four caskets
Put black, red, or blue? which one are you?
Set them in a box with Glocks, which one will shot?
Its a war out here my nigga, lace up your boots
Put your emotions in check, put your feelings on mute
Because these bitches pussy will have you cum faster then speeding bullets
Now your nutty for that slutty busting heads over pudding (don't do it)

I'm just trying kick game to you
I been there and done it, I know just what this game do ya
Pushing up daises or 21 on the wake up
So keep your mind on your money and get your cake up
Pistol on my side, eyes on the prize
Life is like chess one move at a time (survive my niggas)
One move at a time (slow it down my niggas)
One move at a time (no lie one move)

Life behind bars where a dumb broad will get ya
Now shes throwing her pussy a party, hardly send you pictures (damn)
I pray for my friends and my enemies
A nigga who envy you really love you but his energy
Surrounded by negativity, vividly hes lost
If you got some lose ends in your circle them but them off quick
I guess them skeletons coming out closet
Seen too many murders got a nigga feeling nauseous
Phones tap like leaking faucets, so faulty
A speech can be so costly, tread softly brother
I know its so hard to shake them handcuffs
You crawl before you walk, then you man up
You don't stand for nothing, I guess you fall for anything that your eyes touch (my God)
Realest nigga in it, naw, its no facade
I do this in my sleep, no sleep, shit this my job (wake up!)


Look I'm play 'em left, got something to live for
My daughters future secure, don't get your wig split boy
(look) I be trying to rise above the evils of my past
These streets pulling at my jeans, how long its going to last?
Before I spaz on one of these rap niggas I hear yall now
We expected it from that nigga, look!
I think different now from a year ago
A year ago, I was stocking these niggas videos, yall don't hear me though
I thank Top Protect for getting that deal done
They say true niggas just call it a miracle
Aviator shades, boy I'm fresher then Morris Day
T.D.E. the movement, concert packed like parades
Play your cards right, I'm the jack of all trades
Went from catching fades to catches broads on stage
Life is what you make it, you're engineering, you are what you are
And thats the man in the mirror, don't get no clearer",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-checkmate-lyrics
Fuck the Police,Black Friday,2010.0,"Let me tell you about this bitch I know
She the dirtiest bitch I know
She done fucked every nigga I know at least one time
She ride around all day looking for something to snatch
Picky bitch she prefer browns and blacks
Picture this call a store liquor store around twelve o'clock
A nigga walked out looking shell-shocked
I guess he knew her too shit his soda dropped
Before his can hit the ground he was up the block
But she loves when they play hard to get
She acting like she don't always get dick
Trust me it's the worst pussy you could ever hit
And if you do she'll probably wanna fuck again
Oh so he hit the fence she put the bright low on him
As he persists the sweat started to show on him
She told her homegirls she got a hot stud
If they wanted to meet him they needed to hurry up
Shit they all came through thick
Bitches in blue dresses no crip

I'm just minding my business
Sitting on rolls like fuck these bitches
Fuck these hoes
Some nigga call them Johnny some niggas call them five-o
But I call them bitches I call them hoes

A nigga just minding his business
On a highway, trunk full of chickens
She spot you roll pass she turning around
See you with your flag she flagging you down
Frantic the bitch'll even hold up traffic on your behalf
Shit it could really get tragic the bitch love the attention
In and out of jurisdictions
Got her mouth open to stick your dick in
Got the worst head you could imagine
She call it foreplay I call it sexual harassment
She pull the dude over at the next exit
Took him out the car damn near started sexin'
Hands by his testicles asking him questions like

Mr. McKinzie you ain't learned your lesson?
You've been a bad boy so I'ma really have to fuck you
Now I'ma get kinky I'ma even handcuff you",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-fuck-the-police-lyrics
Walk With Me,Black Friday,2010.0,"J-A-Y Rock not Jigga
Tryna stack figures
I'm that nigga
Sitting in a parking lot, truck on sixes
Bad bitch with me, got a ass like delicious
Listen, I can paint pictures so vivid you would think I got a art degree
Walk with me, through my town where them killers dwell
Wild, wild Watts
Where we sell rocks, shots go off
Babies get chalked like hop scotch
She fifteen three kids ?
Fucking for some Js
Stripping for some change
Her baby daddy locked in chains
And he wanna blow his brains cause he lost his only girl to the game
Stress on your brain, it'll kill ya
Outta sight, outta mind
Tip bottles and roll swishas
Detectives at the precincts roll and post pictures while your homie pointing fingers
It's a cold world, nigga
Walk with me
I can show you them ins and outs
Stay in the house when them feds is out
Yeah, talking on your cellie
That'll get you twenty
Talking 'bout you got a spot around the corner booming
Not only that, niggas get jealous you better watch em
Soon as they catch you slipping, then they got ya
Hit you with them maracas
Stay sharp as Baraka
Prepare for the mortal combat
Push a button like Obama, drop bombs on ya
Hold my mama
It's a problem if you fucking with my family or my dollars
Ride out in them Impalas
Four niggas with four choppers, four hundred rounds
Guaranteed heart stoppers

Walk with me (walk with me)
I can show you them ins and outs
I can show you what a real nigga's about
Get money, fuck bitches
Stay solid, stay sharp, stay, say wise, stay polished
Nigga, just walk with me
I can show you them ins and out
Show you what getting money's about
Mind your own, live long
Don't be out running your mouth, talk is cheap
Niggas'll run at your house
Just walk with me

Walk with me as I journey through the five block
The division from the villain for my nigga Rock
Ain't much different in my gutter than them Watts gutters
The only difference in my gutter: I'm the motherfucker
Take shots, call shots, I'm a big shot
Run the point, pass the rock, switch the last shot
Gutter soldier with a second chance to rock a mic
So I'm a give it to you raw how I live my life
Corner dweller, rock seller
I done seen it all
From a small pup all the way to big dog
Legendary in these Kansas City gritty streets
If I ain't eating there, a motherfucker better eat
Bleed the weak, and keep some heat, and trust the liquor bottle
Only living for the moment, nigga, fuck tomorrow
Without a conscience, I can get dirty
Back to talk
And I'm hoping that you heard me on this gutter walk",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-walk-with-me-lyrics
Do You Know,UnKnown,2011.0,"Testimonial

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like all the things that life is showing you?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you learn from the things that life has put you through?

All my life in the ghetto, conditions uncomfortable
Watchin' TV, I wish I was a huxtable
Father like Cosby, y'all was just a thought
A dream, my daddy in the streets with them fiends
Mom's in the room, rollin' up her weed
Project parties every night, no sleep
That was back then, on the handlebars of a Schwinn
High off beadies, trippin' off gin
Just a little nigga, needed more guidance
All I know is money, all I know is violence
Life is a plane, and you just the pilot
Watch it, you crash and you burn if you wilin'
I never talk much, silent, gangsters move in silence
You talk too much then you lyin'
In the streets from the words that you speak
I seen it too many times, talk is cheap
Listen

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like all the things that life is showing you?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you learn from the things that life has put you through?

Jay Rock's the name
Grew up on blocks where them rocks were slang
Glocks were aimed, blood was spilled
Still crack bottles, got cups to fill
Blunts to smoke, kids to feed
All we know is guns, sex, money and weed
Tryna live right, I was doin' it wrong
Stress in my brain had me down in patron
Strokin' on some pussy almost every day
Pimpin' these hoes to put some food on my plate
I know it sounds harsh, but somebody gotta do it
Fake niggas claiming they real but I'm the truest
Sippin' on that Cuervo, watching my days go
Stackin' my pesos, keepin' my cake close
Doin' my thing, bro, niggas they hate, though
Real niggas love me, I stay connected like legos

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like all the things that life is showing you?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you learn from the things that life has put you through?

Just livin' life, every day, every night
Drinkin' brown, getting high, feelin' right
I'm in the sky, I ain't dancing with the stars
I'm in the club, might be dancing with your broad
I'm stressed out, because the bills due tomorrow
Tryna drink it off, if the rap don't work, it's to the raw
A nine-to-five ain't me, nigga, fuck your boss
I ain't tryna take a loss and at any cost
I'ma get it like I know how
With the work, I walk inside a bank with my Chrome out
It could happen, what do you do when the pressure come?
Don't let the Devil hit your pressure points, pay attention

Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like all the things that life is showing you?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you learn from the things that life has put you through?

Please wipe your feet on the door mat

And I lean on anything (move) please get out my way, I'm proving greatness

And I'm still on the block and you wishing you was
But you can't come back, they see the bitch in you blood
Jay Rock been gutter with the roaches and the rats
Pull up in that 7 series then I park it in the trap
Homies give me dap and the bitches give me hugs
The industry hate me but the hood show me love
I've been doing this, I've been seen the grams
And the ounces to the bricks coming straight up out the Nicks
Federalies got they eyes on the operation
(First the work, talk it cold, slowly conversatin'?)
Smash it down, cop the nav, headin' to the swap meet
Cop a thousand white tees, Cortez Nikes, chains all icy
Niggas know better, it ain't no point to try to fight me
Them choppers get hyphy

Ridin' slow with my eyes on low
Niggas can't see inside my window
(What up? I'm in the hood)
And I ain't never going nowhere
Swear you can find me right here (Y-yeah)
I ain't fresh out the hood
I'm still in the hood
Still, still in the hood

Steppin' out the liquor store, two 11 tall cans
Bottle of that Jose, gin with the OJ
Hundreds with the old face, kush in a swisher wrap
Watts on my fitted cap Nigga where your city at?
Mine's on the east side, ace to the (losom lot?)
Welcome to the beehive, show you what it be like
Niggas better behave, have heart be brave
Keep God on your side, now before it's too late
When them lights come on, hear my niggas (thuggin'?)
Cookies comin' out the oven, customers they steady comin'
Dice games
Always jumpin', watch Daddy shake 'em up
(Centerfold?), back door, shake his pocket leave him broke


Now I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Thuggin' old school, rollin' chopper covered in wood
Acrobatic in the coupe top, sipped on time off (?)
Futuristic with the whip the dealership ain't put mine on (?)
Keep it until time's up as soon as they find out (?)
Hater's be in their place so they could beat up and sign off (?)
(???)
And the trapped niggas coppin' it
I represent the (?) in the the city, I'm king bitch
...where rappers never go never get seen bitch
It's 3 in the morning find me at Tony's coppin' up (?)
Ride up the whip for when they reup and most of them (?) be
The only one real enough to bring the hood to wherever

Once I swallow all this juice
Wilding with my crew
In VIP that's where I be
Bottles everywhere
Plus them sexy models service me
Hennessy and sprite mix it up
Watch me act a fool
Gotta crack a bitch
If I'm lucky going home with her too
Bitch I'm thugging

Pushing GS Regals and Cutlass like it's nothing
Got a couple stacks
Buy the bar like it's nothing

When I catch her by myself I'mma knock her
Sipping on all types of liquor
Taking all types of pictures

Drinking stupid hard
If you tripping dog
We going to pull your car
Big drums

Got a lot of weed just bring your smoke

Ring the alarm or wake to a bomb
You ain't a rapper, you Elton John, holdin' your john
I got a ton of croutons in the Louis Vuitton
That's big bread the chickens are flying flocks when I call 'em
Paul and Masson, half drunk, stuck in a poem
Light matches underwater while I'm bracing the storm
I'm cool and I'm calm, laid back, smoking a farm
Socking the shit out of niggas till I'm breaking my arm
Up in my zone, two blunts, cup of patron
.45 on me, shoot you if you fuck with me wrong
No homo'—pause—that's your life and it's gone
Flat line you, don't put your life in the song
I never drove a fast car—I almost ran over
Tracy Chapman, she said, ""Drive slow,"" I said, ""Fuck off""
Ab-Soul—wha'sup, y'all? Other than your sub-par
Above all? I'm a heaven gate—above all
Fuckin' great, and every time we in the stu'?

The Black Hippies, the bag full, the bag empty
Spunt it all at the car lot, then crash quickly
I'm tryna come with enough power to pass 50
I'm talking 50-bill, you niggas don't fit the bill
You niggas don't keep it real, you fake as Pamela's titties
I pound kitties, then hit the club with dogs with me
Tan Polos, no socks, chop Dickies
Tan coupe, no top, bumping Biggie
Blowing sticky, before the group, been a hippy
Nifty fifty, all blue—real Crippy
Big money, long stocks—ask Pippy
Mask on, one sock—I gets busy
I smoke blacks, relax, and watch Walt Disney
Puff squares, pace in circles until I'm dizzy
Speakin' of Disney—fantasies, I had many
I used to hate on Mickey Mouse 'cause he had Minnie
Anyway—every time we in the stu'?

Break through the spinal, laid back, bumpin' my vinyl
Navigation on the scopes, easy to find 'em
Find you and I'm right behind you—laid back, puffin' a blunt
Gat on my lap, constantly talkin' shit, I'mma dump
Your homies acting charged up, they can still get jumped
Take ya chain, ash the kush for all you punks
However you want, whenever you want, you all can get it
Contagious, it's mad syphilis, blazing this God-giftedness
Die over death sentences, flow hot—plus the beat knock
Like J-witnesses, tell 'em I killed the witnesses
Gifted as twenty Christmases, itchin' to blow
Like twenty bitches with mouths that need a dick in it—wow
I ran rap for half a mile then got tired
Laid down and realized that I was lying
You fuckin' crazy!
Ha—and every time we in the stu'?

Find a whore, have her on the corner fuckin' you and yours
Off tour, steel packed, yeah I got the steel pack
Wish a nigga would yeah, shoot him till his grill snaps
Barbecue a rapper like we barbecue on labor day
Yeah you got them chains and things but you ain't got no paper mang
Still be catchin vapors mang, hotboxin' in a donk
In a south beach, M-I-A, higher than a paper plane
Wavin' at my fans, I'm the man, what you tellin god
I don't rap in booths, I rap in synagogues
I'm the fuckin truth you mothafuckas been frauds
Like stolen mastercards, I out mastered ya'll
I bring disaster to your leaders and your tag alongs
I tell em gimme the whole rack leave them tags alone
I'd rather pop em myself like henny quarts
2 week cruise as I pass 4 ports
Like a chain smoker in a hotel resort
If I resort to violence, it's for the blood sport
Watch a blood drop, watch a blood pour
Yeah the shells hot steam comin out your pours
It's a sauna in my Glock who wanna open up the door?
It's hot up in my block and it ain't never snowed before
Unless I had the rock setup shop my own store
I dribbled with the rock the fiends shot so I scored
Kick game even gave em field goals they want more
So I took em out the park like a ford vehicle movin forward
That's crazy ain't it? I take it overboard
I make a rapper walk the plank whenever I record
I make them bitches give me brain like a motherboard
Me and my niggas run trains when your mother bored
I know what you thinkin, I'm a reckless boy
I take the necklace off your neck leave ya headless boy
Wait a minute drama, catch my breath
Take 2
Sleepy hollows with them hollows I be ridin you just follow
I'm original you borrowed your style, I'm wild
Like gorillas in the congo bring gorillas to your condo
Let em run bitch through your goodies for a while
Desperado with a magnum in a tahoe and a magnum on my dick yeah
Fuckin' on these models in a motel 6 yeah
Wait, that was 06 now I'm pimpin at the W
Penthouse, balcony throwin' up W's
The crowd at the lower level like, ""we lovin' you""
In the words of nipsey hu$$le, ""I fucks with you""
This uncomfortable
If you a new artist, that ain't your album droppin
That's a floppin target
You niggas shop at target
I'm at the swap meet, coppin a fresh white tee
Cause my hood buzz the largest
Put prices on your head, niggas built for bargains
Make you run your jewels, you was built for talkin'
Now nigga anny up, before I load this cannon up
And can your candy ass no homo pull your panties up
Pssst, jay rock obama could bring drama to a horror film

They Want my Spot,From Hood Tales to the Cover of XXL,2010,"Yeah, B—these niggas want my spot, dog
These niggas can't have it, though, look
Check it out, though, look

A lot of hating going on around these parts
Soon as you get some money then the bullshit starts
Yea, you get them funds then yo enemy's come
Another Watts star rapper I ant finna be one
They want to see a nigga fall off, give up, then quit it
Hell naw my nigga shits gettin realer
And I came to far to throw it away
That's what you want me to do, you wanna take my place
But, first things first you can't walk in my shoes
And the second thing is you ain't keeping it true
I know niggas ain't my friends I'm feeling the vibe
Talk about me when I'm gone, tellin em lies
My daddy told me I was gone feel this shit
But I never seen it coming it's how real it gets
Niggas actin like hoes, female dogs and it's killing them slow when the see me ball
Continue to go hard, and crush these mics, and fuck all them haters who want this light
Can't have.. Can't have it... Nah
These niggas yea want my spot

I dun came true
In this life I live
Push me to the limit
But I will never quit i5
(They want my spot)

This rap business is a motherfucker
It's hard to socialize when you surrounded by fake motherfuckers
Through the mist of it all I gotta stay focused
Because the moment I slip up my spot's open
Yea niggas wanna keep me down
I'm on the rise like yeast, I gotta feed my child
And I know you niggas jealous I can see y'all smiles
Turn my back in my eyesight I see y'all frowns
Uh, it gets ugly on the road to riches
You see them storms coming and the path get rugged
Niggas pretending they love you but they eyes on your budget
These lames want my spot motherfucker I ain't budging
Ain't your average rap goon, some niggas is clowns
Rock good in any hood you can check my file
Only the real niggas understand my style
That's why their ears to the speaker homie hear me out


These haters second string
They mad 'cause I'm fuckin bad bitches with ass
Pussy sweet as a nectarine
Been bagging hoes before I had flow
I been gettin pussy before I had dough
16 in the spot with D
It all started from a rock then I copped the key
Then I dropped outta school like it wasn't for me
Gangbangin getting money was my drive you see
Pull up in something for your eyes to be
Niggas dispising me, behind bars all this rave was the eyes for me
But I emerged from the flames hit the studios paying lyrical slugs at your brain
Gotta understand it's the life I live
Still in the bricks with the project kids

When I walk back, more vicious than wildcats
I would have swallowed that

Build a monument
Gotta put a clip to your conscience
Watch this, pull up on your block in a stick-shift
Pop six, watch you fall just from the fifth hit
The spliff lit, when I'm high can't I spit sick
First round, number one draft on  shit
Got the mind of a chief, the heart of a soldier
With a rifle got a hell of a range like rover
And the fight, got a hell of a strike like vipers
When the gat, got a hell of a aim like snipers

Pretty and she with the business
Block to a massacre

I don't want no problems
I just want more dollars
Hit the car lot, trick it off like a globe trotter
No one on the globe hotter
I'm volcano about to erupt, gettin' my dick sucked on them gold wires
I'm a product of the 90's, you bitch
9 double-oh-five-9, where you find me, you bitch
Same hood, same corner, same criming, you bitch
And it's grimy and shit
And I'm still on the liquor (?), nobody promised me shit
I'm a prime example if you're trying to get rich
On my grind everyday, and I get a A plus
If I use this AK, so what?
You got your little bit of rap songs
Rapper watch, rapper chain, from rapper loans
Wanna hop on a track? I'd rather rap alone
Rack a few more racks and keep my ratchet on
I don't trust no rats, I've been ratted on
So I keep my traps inside my palace homes

I'm a rapping Q-B
Jumping off the porch with a chopper and a 4 loco
Going loco, bust your head and give ya promo
Ugh, that's the sound of the medics
After working the pound out like calisthenics
Smokin' on lettuce, drinking on white though
Chain like a light show, crazy, psycho, explosive, nitro
I'm the prince of this shit, oops that's a typo
I'm the King dumb bitch, kiss the ring pay homage
Kick doors, play Sonic, Doggystyle, Dre, Chronic
Albums that's fucking timeless

No flocking no stealing shit
Straight cash money, on my Bryan B. Williams shit
Better yet this is a robbery, pushing up on your property
Kicking off of monopolies, been here sounding so properly
It  ain't no stopping me, yeah I'm fulfilling prophecy
Robberies yeah they obsolete, better keep all your eyes on me
Watch me closely, move ghostly, hit them hard like cold cheese

What I need to do man to get to the top""
I said ""Man just keep goin' hard, my nigga
Don't give up on your dream, dog
Just keep strivin' man
Just be a man
Do what you do""

I was raised in the projects
Amongst the rats and the roaches
Gutter conditions
We serve and we protect, our fortress
Stay strapped dog if beef approaches
Posted with some war vets
Sippin' Hennessy straight
Soaking up game rollin weed
Strike a flame
Taking off like a plane
On any nigga disrespecting me and my gang
Say it simple and plain
Niggas know I'm heavy on a track like a train
In my way, meet your doom
Platinum blast coming soon
Used to sit up in my room and write for hours
My story, hit the store
Rip rock from powder
On the hunt for dead presidents
No mask on
Just a digital scale
Two Glocks and trap songs
Its amazing now
Gettin paid off my rap tunes
Gotta have faith my nigga
Dreams come true

Get it while the gettin' is good
Better get it while you can
One shot don't get no second chance
If you feel this shit dog lemme see your hands
Stay on your road nigga, stick to your plans
Only real niggas understand
Fuck a handout be a man
Stop complaining
Get on your shit, nigga
Get on your shit

Up early in the mornin' gotta make moves
Gotta get dollars
Yeah my daughter she need shoes
Mo money, mo problems what I'm facin'
But I ain't really worry
I'm thanking God that I made it
And if the drama come let it come I ain't runnin'
I ain't no pussy
 
far from a rookie straight stuntin'
Success it sucks, too much stress
Well I don't know about that I got niggas upset
My mama proud cause her baby boy traveling
Across the 50 states shutting shit down,
 extravagant
Women think I'm magnificent
Real niggas respecting what I'm spittin'
Why? Cause a nigga really livin' it
Striving for the best got it in my peripheral
Cock, aim, shoot til' I'm blessed with residuals
Get on your shit dog
Keep your mind on your money
Watch how you go far


Took the shades off
See the flames in my eyes
Rollin' up that good
Blow the haze to the sky
I'm tryna' build me a enterprise
If your fucking with your boy put the bullshit aside
Hopped in the ride
Smashing down on 105
Up in PAC, BI.G, E.A.Z.Y
E east side where i reside
So see how no bow-ties, niggas sold some pies to get by
Been there done that, now I'm tryna' run rap
Tryna' get money like the Simmons
Where Run at?
Reverend, gotta break bread with my brethren
Who the best rappers of the century?
That's irrelevant
It's all about whats popular now

Nowadays its all about a gimmick

Tell me, where did them days go?
(Back in the days, Back in the days)

Smoking on a blunt and I'm reminiscing
When I was just a young nigga with dreams and big wishes
Just a little guppy, swimming with big fishes
I was like seven, my favorite channel eleven
Couldn't wait to see them Simpsons, a cartoon fanatic
My parents on drugs, who didn't have habits?
But ain't nobody perfect on this earth surface
You live then you die, that's life's purpose
But I miss them good times, been through the worsest
But I gotta thank God for blessing us
I ain't never had nothing, first day of school
My excuse, my momma waiting for a check to come
And I ain't had no gear, but I ain't shed one tear
Because my momma never raised a punk, yeah
But through the midst of it all I miss them old days
Granny cooking gumbo, my daddy bumping his ol-days

Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But can somebody tell me (where did them days go)
Where did they go? Where did they?
(Tell me, where did them days go?)
Where did they go?

On the train tracks, throwing rocks and shit
Flipping on pissy mattresses, in the back of the jam
Big homie's trafficking, who didn't have to sin?
To put some food on the table to feed they family
Cause being broke is no joke, it brings insanity
How I know? I seen it everyday
Smoke is up and down the block, tripping, gone off the yay
Crack pipes, bullet shells, in the sand where we play
Dead body in the street, seen it every other day
Sittin' in the house, now I'm watching the box
Wrote my first rap, man I thought I was Pac
Back in 9-4, when the bricks was live
Some hoods was at peace, some hoods broke ties
But through the midst of it all I miss them old days
Granny cooking gumbo, my daddy bumping his ol-days


I was a little young buck soaking up the game
Wondering how the fuck I'm gonna make it, out here, no-o-o
I could be like the niggas I grew up with
On the block serving crack rocks, all that shit, but noooo, no not me
And even though I got real killas that live on yo street
I don't be sounding the alarm when I got beef
I got me
(Cause if it's going down muthafucka)
I got me

Blood, I'm on 112 obitual with it

We on the avenue, we on the boulevard
We blockin' off the block, we corner corner-shops
We in the street, we in the street
We in the street, we in the street

Mmm, smellin' like dinner time
You got a five star mill on you, give me mines
And when I take it make sure you don't drop any dimes
You play Magic Earvin
You gon' see a black burner and a black turban
That's a black mask
And tell your bitch to get that necklace out her handbag
You see it's cutthroat
And my reality is cut dope and gun smoke
Another casualty the family in the front row of the church pews
A politician don't understand a hood nigga' views
You see them devils in them black and whites
And hit the lights, we hit them corners like Regis on a Monday night
I'm in the spot like a dalmation
Bake a cookie dinner, nigga break it, go 'head nigga taste it
You know I keep them goodies in the oven
Dawg it's nothin' want a dish, say somethin'
Holla at me


Smack the back of my hand with a fresh pack
At the meeting the homies know I press facts
Can't ignore that he-say, she-say
He pillow talk, what she say, he say
On Keeway, they wanna see me in the pen
Gettin' ends tryin' not to fall completely into sin
Ever been in a trap where everywhere you turn
You learn it won't help for you to make a U-turn
Been through bullshit it only made the S better
Recorded with Cube, arguably the best ever
Ask me, it gotta be a conspiracy
Still, no hate in my spirit, see
They keep my reputation like ""why are you the worst""
No matter how you rehearse they don't vibe through the verse
Will my world wide web ever hit these fans
Only God knows, it's out of 50's hands",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-in-these-streets-lyrics

Top Dawg Entertainment!
Jay Rock, talk to 'em nigga!
Yeah
Jay Rock, niggas
Yeah
Watt's finest. 
Top Dawg Entertainment, bitch
We them do-it niggas
Do it
Y'all better look out
 (do it), 
K.Dot the hub city threat
Punchline, that nigga's a monster
Juice, he'll snatch your ho
And the fat light skinned nigga with braids, he'll fuck you up
Let's go

I'm a straight up menace
I ain't talking 'bout Dennis
Fuck a slingshot
Thing cock it's a nickel plated beam Glock
Straight out the bricks I'm with the business
In the hood making a killing on that cash route
I ain't got time for chilling
I ain't a chump, test if you want
I'll light your ass up like the tip of a blunt
And your mouth on the tip of the pump
Pull the trigger then, watch your top open like the back of a trunk
Pouring hot shit through your back and your front meat
Won't stop dumping 'till you slumped in the front seat
Gun speak, talk's cheap, that's how it is where I be
 around the corner pistol in my hand when I sleep
Bodies steady dropping every day of the week
Dog it's nothing new that's how it it is on these streets
The AR, that'll knock your ass off your feet
So gone body left for the pastor to preach
Niggas dying life seem worthless
Been to more funerals, than a church service
Red and blue raggers ride for the purpose
Banging never played out like 
Come to the hood, see Glocks jerkin'
Kids sling chrome nigga, one time swervin'
Gangbanging shit never coming to an ending
Whoever started it, that nigga can't finish it
Real talk, gotta watch where you walk
Gotta a maroon colour, your body outlined in chalk
Trunk full of guns, for whoever want drama
Gotta a lot of hand pistols and a lot of Llamas
Got the inf beam on top of the black revolver
Get you 6 shots at a bar like an alcoholic
Niggas scheming and they hate when a nigga balling
My dollar's rising and they funds is steady falling
Fuck em with raps, I'm strapped with a lot of condoms
HIV, that's an uncurable problem
You got a gat, it don't take nothing to pop it
One shot to the head guaranteed to drop 'em
Dot, he'll put five in your face and leave ya
(Chopped and screwed like a Houston mixtape)
Niggas gotta wear bulletproof vests
Niggas wasn't born with a bulletproof chest
Teams getting better so they cutting more cheques
Niggas be hating so we buying more TECs
You bitch niggas, y'all better act right
Yeah my gun's steady smoking like a crack pipe
Woah, my heart cold as popsicle
And I'll  your block on a bicycle
Doom Dog, he the captain nigga call me skipper
I'm Gilligan with a gat, I'll leave you crippled
I stay on a mission 187 plenty ammunition
That'll leave a bitch nigga missin', listen huh
I can throw them things, I ain't a punk B
And I roll the dope leave your face all lumpy
Got ballers that shoot straighter than Ginobili
That'll leave you bleeding son, like a ho on a monthly
Yeah, we spending grands monthly
In the trunk, that's where the Mossberg pump be
We got cars roll heavy like tanks
Y'all guns all sterile, y'all be shooting blanks
We don't give a fuck what you think, spit a flame
Afterthought about your brain, should have stayed in your lane
Niggas be shook when the guns is out
Yeah, bullets at your body while some blood come out
Nigga, get low when I blast the 4
Slugs at your head looking like a Sloppy Joe
Give it up nigga, you sloppy joe
Jay Rock came through with a cocky flow
I'm hard, and I'm raw like cocaine
I'm hot like propane, embedded in your head like Rogaine
In high school is was a flunky
I was too busy in the hood serving rock to the junkies
Close your mouth don't front G
I still gotta collect 5 dollars from your auntie
Black jeans 9 ball under the white tee
I'm your pusher man hustling flow like Ice-T
Women think I'm handsome now, all the girls like me
Don't believe me, bitch nigga ask your wifey
Had her in my house she was loving the wood
Had her legs in the air like the kick was good
It's Top Dawg
, niggas misunderstood
Don't be alone when we enter your hood",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-freestyle-100-bars-lyrics
Dollars Make Sense,No Mask On,2008.0,"Twisted off the herb
Kush got me lifted like some hands up in church
26 inches, sittin' off the curb
Big money make a killin' when I kill 'em with my verbs
But haters wanna talk, tryin' to work my nerves
Pay 'em no mind I just hit 'em where it hurts
The gutter's in my blood, know i came from the dirt
Step up in the place, not a stain on his shirt
Don't try to jack, or things'll get worse
You don't really wanna see this mac 10 emerge
Might be at a bar, drinkin' like a fish
Baby wanna swallow so I might grant her wish
Down, spent a lot of dollars on this fit
Struttin' like a pimp, see the guccis on his kicks
I know the niggas jealous of a kid
That's why I keep them uzis in the whip don't trip

Don't make a mothafucker pull the tool out
Or everybody's laid out like a luau
Don't make a nigga make the news now
You fly lookin' for somethin' to shoot down
You niggas think I'm insane (insane)
You think I lost my brain (my brain)
And I could give a fuck about your whits
Imma tell you like this
Only dollars make sense

You niggas better recognize
I can hop out and spray like a sector side
A hundred rounds'll have your whole hood petrified
Pull up, push on niggas for the exercise
It's a chain, why you worried 'bout your necklace size?
Niggas 'round the corner waitin' just to snatch it
Hit you with the ratchets, they do it for the practice
Know a ten year old that'll come and bring you the casket
It's live or die, drinkin' liquor 'till my liver fries
Imma G, you can see through any given eye
On any given Sunday, a nigga sinnin' heavy
In the city with the water, never broke a levy
You mothafuckers ain't ready
I'm hot like the Serengeti, so deadly
Still jealous of a kid
That's why I keep them uzis in the whip don't trip


I'm 'bout fed up with this rap shit
And Rock the only dude I wanna rap with
Rest of y'all, shit, a nigga wanna scrap with
You bitches lights, camera, action like an actress
Fact is, I'm just tired of directing
Now, when I yell shoot, there's bullets flyin' your direction
Ground covered in blood stains and mac shells
Then I ride off in the cut ti bumpin' mac swells
It's Watts where prop. look is rat tail
Shit, the only thing up is the crack sales
So I invest, stocks in the streets
Let the fans worry 'bout 'em, beach cruisin' get release
You see this water, and this white is my relief
Imma pump, pump, pump 'till my heart cease to beat
I know y'all jealous of a crip
That's why I keep them uzis in the six, don't trip bitch",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-dollars-make-sense-lyrics
Talk My Shit (Again and Again),Coming Soon 2 a Hood Near You,2009.0,"Now these niggas don't want me to win
I guess I just gotta talk my shit then

Tell em' they better count me in, like Dracula
Packing a black mack in the back of a magnum
You rappers is gon' go
That's one hell of a punch line but let's get back to the flow
Left jab hit your nose
Right hook fracture your skull
Your body is free
Put luxury tax on your soul (OG)

Like a rough rider working out in the hood and stuff
They say I ain't in the hood enough?
Bitch I'm a transmission
The pump leak when your oil slipping
And I been in the kitchen, like a toaster
With them toasters, hang you like a Willie Lynch poster
East side vulture, preying on your dead caracas
Sorry I was starving

Every stripe that it takes

The beat made me write with a sway
Me and Jay bring the night to the day
And bring the night to the page
As far as bars go
Literally up there fam I call the stars home
I'm by far past far from the forlorn
I leave this bar open unless you log on
Figure that part out
Wikipedia that
I Wikipedia whack and look up your stats
More fuckers start hiding when they get on the track
They ducking behind the snare like I ain't divvying that
And if you speaking of the speaker
I'm the speaker that the speakers applaud for
Speaker that the speakers turn on for
I'm leaking through the speakers on all y'all
My short term speaking is long haul
Your speaking is all gone

Catastrophic K.Dot
Currently stacking currency

Burnt and melted
Jump in the water
Jaws is ready to eat you selfish
I'm cold hearted

Talk shit like a nigga farted
But the smell came out the other hole

Hol' up, big truck
Lurking the premises
Pull up, hoes rubbing they clitoris

This is K.Dot, they pray I
Fall like a jump shot
From they favorite player
With seconds on the clock

Black people (feat. kendrick lamar),UnKnown,UnKnown,"My people don't love me
Why we hate each other?
Why we kill our brothers, why we hurt our mothers?
My people don't love me
We can love one another
We should stick together because we're all we got
My people don't love me
Why we ride on another, need to love one another
We all we got
My people don't love me
I said we all we got, I swear to God dog we all we got
My people don't love me
This whole world's spillin' senseless killing
Universe beyond evil, one topic to serve
Be my black people, we be missing the point like Shaq's freethrow
Sean Taylor, life gone because of haters
A nigga he known tried home invasion, went wrong
Bullet penetrated his leg, femur bone
Days later, wake arrangements, flowers to be catered
That was so impatient, take him from the next man
Cause he ain't got the will to hustle like he can
Niggas would rather steal than think of a righteous plan
To get residuals, kill for dividends
This life is critical, we living in a time where
9-year olds tote 9's
Turn 10, it's Mac 10's and coke lines
I wonder why successful black man gotta die from a black man
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
Can't be a positive black role model
Leading the future with no haters to follow
Now that's fucked up, if I ever wanna see
Success, I gotta see death? Be famous for what?
He aiming for higher learning, you aiming to shoot him down
He flying straight, you wanna u-turn him
You burn your brother's bridges
His accomplishments making way for your children
Still you don't compliment, inconsiderate black pride
No never been, never win, gotta lose
That's the slope that's for the black heritage
We play the fool better than comedians
Disobediant dude no respect, ethics
I refuse to be a statistic
But changing my community don't seem realistic
Show me an African American doing right
I'll show you one that will kill his ass tonight
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
We stuck together back in slavery days
Martin and Malcolm them dudes paved the way
The bullshit we doing, I know they're turning over in their graves
The shit need to stop today
Yeah the die for the cause, some like Jesus for us
To become better people, think about it
We used to run from the KKK
But now we running from our brothers that be holding them k's
Man, never thought there'd be days like this
Can't trust your homies that you're hanging with
Damn shame, why you kill a nigga over a chain
When you could get up on your hustle and get the same thing
United we stand tall, divided we all fall
Let's leave this bullshit behind y'all
On the real, the envy and the hate need to stop
Black people we all we got
My people don't love me
Why everywhere I go I got to accumulate some hate?
My people don't love me
Genocide all we know shit, we basically in the KKK
OK-K-K, I'm trying to make my cake
But every time I turn around you take it from me
Black people don't love me
Hate each other we do each other wrong
That's why today, black people let's love we
Y'all better wake up and smell the coffee
We all we got man
It's black on black killing each other man it needs to stop
Real talk
Black people need to smarten up
We all we got

Yet I'm still I'm feelin' victorious
Look down my corridor
Look at the palace

Soul of a god
Nickel plated hyper
Fourth fifther
Straight liquor
Come between me and the money
That's when I erase a nigga
Picture on the corner to the lights off
No nights off
I can give it to you hard
Or that white soft

Thank The Lord,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Waking up another California morning, sun shining through my window
Another day of being broke, but I survived another 24, so;
""Thank the Lord"", that's what momma say
Momma stressing over them bills, gotta be payed
The food getting low, eating noodles and cereal
But the first of the month is like two days away, so;
""Thank the Lord"", them checks coming
Some shots rained out and everybody is running
The enemy came through looking to hurt something, but who?
Never knew the hollow tips would touch nothing, I;
""Thank the Lord"", nobody was hit
No cops patrolling the hood for gangs injunction
It's all good, we can hang out
So bring a grill and a radio out, it's a celebration, no doubt we;
""Thank the Lord"", for our freedom

It's so hard, so hard to get by
Momma always say the strong will survive
So I'm gon' get praised for everything I got
""Thank the Lord""
Because I know one day, one day that I
Will make it, better wait, they say in due time
So I'm gon' keep my head touching the sky
""Thank the Lord""

Project house party, no altercations, what a surprise
Homies was shootin' dice outside
But everybody was sober, therefore meaning nobody was robbed, so;
""Thank the Lord"", nothing popped off
Lil' mama quick to take her top off
She too young to be having sex, only being in ninth grade
She listened to Pac seen the mistakes that Brenda made, so;
""Thank the Lord"", she was inspired
I hate having to see that lil' boy watching us smoke up something to that loud, now that's nothing I enjoy
But the deep game slowed up meaning nobody's employed, so;
""Thank the Lord"", the fools had nothing to hit
Nobody hoppin' that fence, nobody thinking 'bout tryna commit
We just tryna remember the Watts Riots
Knowing I survived that, I can't help but just;
""Thank the Lord"", I'm still here


I got my priorities right, no more hanging out late nights ducking the force
I know you see my name in the limelight, so of course I;
""Thank the Lord"", I got a career
Momma was disappointed throughout the years, but now she's proud
I love to see my success make her smile
I love to see them Jay Rock shirts i-in the crowd, I;
""Thank the Lord"", for my fans
I sit back for a minute and put it in GOD's hands
He said he'll have it mapped out tomorrow
I said ""that's a little too quick"", but that's when I met dude, dawg I;
""Thank the Lord"", for him believing in me
Went from that project boy on the block to winning awards
Multi-million record sales, worldwide tours
I never regret being poor, the more I think about it I;

Thug It Out,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aye, Ya'll niggas stop talking all that shit in the club man

It ain't a problem we can thug it out

Come show me what you talking 'bout (talking 'bout)
(Right here what's good)
Ain't a problem so just watch your mouth
(Talk tough til' we)
Erase your face and take you out (take you out)
It ain't a problem

Back in the days
Unfortunately a lot of real niggas being replaced
With all the official niggas that put frowns on their faces
Every time the m's come on they perpetrating
I guess I grew up different
I can't blame them, my childhood had to evolve around killers
Gangs and drug dealers, weed and cocaine
Which eventually made me who I am today
So I don't pay attention to 'em
I don't ever listen to 'em
I just brush off their loud talk
Play the background waiting for something to pop off
Watch the same nigga run to his car
Lame nigga never saw guns before
Be the same nigga talk about his guns to blow
He be considered a joke
When the hot ovens come out, it's life or death
Cutthroat niggas run back to their mom's house
You scared nigga


White  on the ride
Model bitch on the side
On my lap 4-5
Nigga that's how I drive
On these streets homeboy it's do or die
You wouldn't know because you never came outside
The wise man said actions speaks louder than words
And you clown niggas working my nerves
Hop in the booth and say you put work on the curb
Guns in the hood but never took a  on the turf
Never mention that when you rapping your verse
Nah, act tough when you yap on the chirp
Ain't that some shit your homies come around and you act like you run shit
Then wanna question my gangsta up on some dumb shit
Don't do that, we won't shoot where your legs is at
It's either your head or the area where your head pledging at
No allegiance, now breathing under God
Bitch


It's funny how these niggas be so hard on a record
See 'em in the streets, these niggas be soft as a feather
Yeah the ones that be in the club and they get their chain snatched
We play for keeps so I doubt they get their chain back
Plus the ones that talk tough behind the microphone
Be the first niggas to run when the fight is on
Them niggas scary and it's easy to see
I ain't calling out names, got caller ID
Niggas want beef boy you know where I be
In G projects, 112 street look
Don't need to check my resume nigga I'm good
B.L double O D nigga I'm hood
Lifting weights think he solid as a rock
Bet I knock his ass down from a .45 shot

Then they chalkin' you out, wrappin' you up
Walkin' you out to grave where they puttin' your ass down

Better pay homage, who you fuckin' with?
This Top Dawg, boy, we takin' over shit

I'm in the best position, I'm what the West was missin'
The forty ounce by the shore with the message in it, get it?
The message in it, writ in the Range, then performed by
The black-lipped bastard with the four eyes
Worked a fortune, four pies
Forklifted in the sky, reconfigured and delivered by I
My attitude is smooth, but my altitude is high
I thank God I never had to do time
Confined to the grime like a Pusha T
But you can see the malice every time the clips spit at you
This is rapture from a Jurassic Park raptor
And you look like a Jurassic Park actor
Bark at you, one hit to the lip, jaw fractured
This is it, fall backwards
Nah, that would mean that you stood for somethin'
Crawl backwards to your habitat
Top Dawg, you niggas is pussy as a alley cat


Yeah, they say, ""More money, more problems""
Well, since a nigga had more money, no problems
Revolver will solve him and back him off my dick
No homo, you can catch me on the black bitch
It (?), bitch, still no homo

So when they walk through that door, bitch, grab my coat
Indo make me choke, y'all niggas fuckin' with whom?
It's Top Dawg and the nigga comin' soon


Yeah, vigilante K. Dot, feelin' antsy when I jump in the booth
Top Dawg, lick two shots
Cameras off, this is pay-per-view, City of Compton-bound
Your fraternity die instantly on my stompin' grounds
Code of the streets, eye for an eye
And only thing could come between that is a unibrow
You are now tuned into hieroglyphics, chips like Macintosh
Clips like a movie script
Back off or I put tips on you like you strip
Then make you strip like a chop shop, do your call
This is real as it gets
Y'all will never exist once I journalist the current events
Furnace, return and burn on your strip
Burn a homie, got an umbilical cord to my hip
Glock 40, double clip, plus a six-shooter
Catch forty, bitch, black Berry Gordy
Flip, shorty, pass him to the homies
Half 'em lookin' for me, gave her good dick",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-we-run-this-lyrics
Smooth Operator,No Sleep Til NYC,2007.0,"Well excuse me take a few minutes to hear me out
Jay Rock is on the microphone I'm bout to turn it out
Like rock bands when I'm rocking the stage
The flow murder is should be locked in a cage
I could rhyme fast or slow tempo
Metaphors Knock you out your Chucks or Timbos
Bitches love to relax and watch how i perform
Hear my voice on a track and they kitty cat get warm
No I’m not animated homie I’m real official real nigga I ain’t the type thats artificial
Across the globe I’m a rhyme slayer
Connecting with the masses a smooth operator
Its the JAY Roc spit like a semi
Automatic serving competition look its a habit
I’m dissing anyone who appose this god MC
I’m a nightmare on any street
These lames think they so high but they so not
They lines don’t even fit they profile
I think yo ass don’t wanna compete with the terminator
Exterminatin’ sucker MC’s
I’ll expose you hoes with flows I’m fire and great enough to disable your ghost writer
When I do it I do it with much flavor, Jay motherfuckin’ rock I’m a smooth operator

Blue Bent baby blue tint baby
G got g that’ll drive a bitch crazy
G got heat that’ll crash niggas laces
Been a cold young nigga since my OG Laced me
OG’s faced me, got her reminiscin’  of days back when
They was popping’ them ignitions
K’s Mac 10 smoke like emissions
In the field I trip, you kids need permission
Its GuttaVille homie, we the hardest believe
Get deals fuck a mill off on charges and weed
Got a loaded 50 cal case I gotta pop a hater
Ask your bitch I’m such a smooth operator",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-smooth-operator-lyrics
Can I Roll,From Hood Tales to the Cover of XXL,2010.0,"Riding in my Chevy, 66' to be exact
Pussy wet paint, got the rims to match
Old school 'Lac, sitting on the white walls
Pull up, hop out, while she drop drawers
Hol up, take a look at my wheels
They wonder how I fit sixes on a Chevy Chevelle- easy
Got a 454 on the hood
Line it up if your car go fast as it should
Slow it down, hit switches till I'm breaking the frame
In the Regal three wheelin' it, switchin' them lanes
Ain't nothin change but the interior in my Lincoln
Turn on the AC, kush got the whole car stinkin'
High creeping call up in that glass house
Turn on my 4 15's and then I stab out
Bitches love it when the top's down
Jay Rock roll king in my compound

I got that 64 rack top
In that glass house
Make the boppers turn they head
Once I pull them Chevy's out
(I'm talkin'  wheels)
It's something mental, it's monumental I know
That's why they screaming ""Can I Roll?""

On a 105, me and my niggas trailin'
Switching lanes, whippin' that 10 before 7
That's 6:50, hop in the Chevy Silverado
Big Truck driving, big Glocs aside me
2010 'Maro, Radley stripes
180 on the dash chrome on the pipes, yeah
In that challenger I ride like a star
Bad bitch ride shotgun lickin' my balls
She don't want the hotel, she wanna fuck in the car
So we in the backseat while I'm up in her walls, whoa
Don't get it twisted, still dippin the 
On vogues, what? Nigga I'm no joke


Yeah, young baller on a budget
'Prolly frontin, Rock lemme borrow the Cutlass
I swear the hoes will think I'm stuntin' like the daredevil
You know the real thick ones? Preferably high yellow
I'll bring it back in one piece my nig
Cuz you know what they be sayin' in the streets my nig?
""Them Top Dog mofucka's, they be doin' it big, like
Fuckin' bad bitches, but I ain't that with it!
They better check my statistics
Had the hubcaps missin' on a bucket
Now I pull up to the club in something on sixes
Hop out the back seat, they on my dick in a instant
Like ""Can we roll Ab-Soul?"", No, ""Asshole!""
Ha, and I might be in that old school
With a A-Track still in it, the speakers still kickin'
Like bad breath, who wanna cross paths next?

Trapped In The Hood,Black Friday,2010.0,"Stepped out my project unit
Loaded my strap, hope I don't have to use it
Jumped in my magnum, gripping the magnum
Patrolling my hood, through the block just to see what's happenin'
Turnin' on the deuce, little kids out wrestlin' (?)
Got me thinking back when I used to flip off trash cans
That was '9-5, back when Beadie (?) ran the block
Doo Dog and Teez (?) had it on lock
With them crack spots rollin'
I used to sit and watch smokers cash they whole check for the rocks
Another sad day, (?) got shot, Lil Hit (?) got shot, then Q-Tip got popped
Over the years so many from the rolls and tears
We born to die, hummers never living in fear
Back on patrol, see whats popping up in the gym
The homies ballin', then they right back on they hustle again
Soon dice in the cup, police roll up
Everybody scattering trying to shake them cuffs
Gang injunction, can't really hang too much
Pointing out niggas? That'll get your cranium touched
That's why I see the homies with them things on tuck
Roll through don't know you didn't bangs gone bust (?)
Living off survival instincts, as they should
Gunplay, slinging yay, that's life in my hood

Niggas, hustlin', strugglin' just to make it daily, trapped up in the hood
(We hustle, we struggle, on that row, gotta go through troubles)
Niggas, hustlin', strugglin' just to make it daily, trapped up in the hood
(We bang, we slang, that's life in the hood, gotta make a little change)

When it was '9-5, watchin' Beadie (?) being observed
2001, I found myself on the curb
Rockin' it up, choppin' it down for them dollars
Niggas was wildin' up in the bushes with them choppers
Momma was hollin', put your pants up, she didn't know that was a problem
Pockets holdin' pistol and thousands, stomachs was growlin'
Lookin' for the next play
Homies run up in each other's spots just for that yay
Enemies come through, take the homie life away
Ride out, lay him down, coming back the next day
Had me ridin' for the turf
The big homie did it, so I had to put in work
Talk later, shoot first
That's the code that we livin' by, sippin' Remy, gettin' high

Ready For War,Watts Finest Vol. I,2006.0,"I got uzis and AKs a plenty
I got gadgets and grenades galore
Every night I make sure that I'm ready
And prepare for war
I got ratchets and TEC-9s and semis
Automatics and shotguns galore
If you fuck with me make sure you're ready
And prepare for war

I got a problem I think you need to solve it
Damn, you fuckin' with us, you might not ever walk again
Bullets hot dog, it'll burn off your skin
This M16, that'll knock off your limbs
Stick up kids will tell you take of your gems
If not catch a bullet through your jaw and chin
This 38 magnum will blow off your wig
At the light K.Dot will take off your rims
You ain't a hustler, show you how to 
Show you how to snatch nick bags, I sell 'em all for ten
I fuck with real niggas, I ain't got time for friends
Keep your enemies close in this game, you win
G shit, this the life I choose
Disrespect me, and I'll beat the life out you
Got a pistol, men pullin' pipes out 
Treat 'em like an unpaid bill, popping bullets, lights out


If you  me too hard then my man will clap ya
He'll leave you on the ground like a candy rapper
Never run from a gun, cause bullets are faster
Have your ass in a church, right in front of the pastor
Niggas run when they hear metal cock
So I know they'll run when the truck open on that pearl yellow drop
Got Glocks on the block like you cops
And two new nigga playin' nine balls fresh out the box
I move with a rocket right, but you could still get
Stabbed in the neck with a pocket knife
Drive by on the  bike
Whoever standing out late on the block gettin' chopped tonight
AKs for the 
My MPs put, shots in they  like they heroin fiends
Now the hood gettin' violence like Taliban
I like Kelly Grace runnin' the marathon


Hand me the shit up off the dresser
Toss me the clip you never know who wanna test us
I lift poles like an exercise, wet you guys
Leave your ass on the curb, left to dry
Who's next to try, who's next to die (tell me)
Who's spirit is next to fly
I'm from the hood so I fuck the 
OG niggas turn your ass to a vegetable
Shots rang out, lives is taken
And that family  back in that hearse they chasin'
Be ready for war, if you mention my name
Yeah that black Mac-10 leave that body in pain
Everybody wanna wear a rag in the wrong place
At the wrong fuckin' time have you 
If you don't make it then your toe grab a tag
 then your body go sizzle in ash

Money buys 
That's the way, against the rules

My price is right, you could come on
Nigga, dimes n dubs
Just bring me your bucks
I'll hook you up with weed, dope or angel dust
My burner talk I'm goin'
To the block where the holdin' them
This place is popping 'till she put the chickens in the kitchen
Can't  sell dope forever, but I gotta make a living
Running your mouth it's goin'
Sold your soul, gotta get shot
Yeah, yeah the code of the streets
Never talk to police
Don't even talk dog
Forever hold your peace
Feds at ya door, it's goin'
Kicked in your door, get on the floor, get
They found all of your dope, now you gotta go
To the federal penitentiary dog, for ten or more
In the hood it's goin'
Rock's settin up shop is goin'
I got that ghetto white
Customers light your pipes
Come to the back door
I got what you like
I you know where it's at come
Rock and K. Dot will hold you (down), Tell 'em Dot

If you want us come see us
Backdoor procedures
We got what you need
As our profit increases
Walking from Centennial, going home like
Straight down Central, got banged on
I ain't even have the pistol
If death was the issue
This shit, I guess it will be a sad song
So I'm thinking to myself like down
They bust a u-turn, so I know I'm goin'
I ain't no bitch or nothing
But if they just start jumping
I got no heat, so fuck it, I'ma start running
Before them shots come flying
Call my nigga Ralo like
Hold a nigga (down)
He ain't had no minutes
So a nigga just hopping fences
But if I do get popped, I hope he'll be a witness
But luckily he turned around
I got home like safe and sound
Now I'm back to the block
Where my uncle was  dishing off the rock
Stay ducking them cops
Cause you know they will lock a nigga
For them small grams, or them pounds
But they won't stop my profit
Or get in my pockets
(Even if it means a nigga gotta) sell narcotics
(We gonna hold shit)
(Open up shop across) town
Cause we gonna get this cream
No matter how hard it seems
We gonna do it together see were a team

Go K.Dot (Freestyle),Watts Finest Vol. I,2006.0,"I told 'em that the truth was comin' niggas
Hey Punch, cover me I'm goin' in

I used to be sceptical about this rap shit
Now I'm a professional at this rap shit
Cause one verse can make the paralysed backflip
Don't compare guys to me, if Jesus could rap
They'd compare God to me, I'm special like that
I move like a freight train over these tracks
Run through you like wet doodle, that's what I'm doin'
Shittin' on niggas, perform bowel movements
Who you, you ain't up to par keeler
Nah keeler, you're word patterings is kinda off keeler
You ain't sick enough, you just a cough keeler
I bring pneumonia to California
Say hello to Mr. West now
Who's the best on the west now?
K.Dot, Jay Rock hands down
Anybody that feel different
You die first class on a cemetery visit, keeler

Keep it runnin' Punch
I told niggas the truth is comin' man
Hey Top put a couple houses on your boy man
I got your shit right here

I'm so far ahead of my time
I'm 'bout to start my third life
Shit I feel like I've died already twice
Then reincarnated and become your unborn grandchild's favourite
I got three brains to play with
I'm so far ahead of my time
I gotta say this shit again
But this time I came back
Double time, rebirth as a twin
Feet first I'm a mother smooth
Like deja vu, times two, now
You could probably dodge a bullet
But see we put your body parts in shopping carts
Till them bums push it
You on the edge nigga don't push it
'Fore the fifth turn you head crooked
I sit your monkey ass down
And best believe, it won't be on no damn cushion
A casket full of thorn bushes
Move the shit while the fiends look
Call the cops, shush
 trying to cock me
You fight the case better off the street
Daddy glove boxin, left hook the judge
Cap the jury up
You walkin' out with a Jefferson strapped
Like, if I come back, so what
It's a fact I rap like every second I gotta throw up
Ouch, spit shit like dookie mouth
Pull out the drop, six whenever your bitch out
We put her on the ave, like cabs and bus route
We put you on the couch, ice cream with your face pout
Watchin' Oprah, wonderin' if she ever come back over
Nah homie she at the crib, makin' her feet touch her shoulders
I'm in her ribs like, hey what's up
She in my closet talkin' bout how much these cost
Don't worry 'bout it, just make sure you tell your girls about it
You know Kelly, Kim, Sherry and Shirley 'bout it
Mama, you can see you fucking with a boss
Look at my kicks, you could see how much these cost
Look at my teeth, yeah ma, gold no floss, yeah
We still doin' it baby
Top Dawg we keep doin' it baby
I'm a boss nigga

She's my favorite girl (Only get one)

Brought me in this world, first person I saw
After the doctors, the nurses wiped me off
Your touch so soft, I could feel the warmth of your heart through the cloth
Just like that we hit it off, love at first sight
No Shakespeare in here, it's real, it's sincere
Mother dear, my all
Man, I can talk about it all day
Walked me school for ten years, no car
Toys for christmas, wonder how, no job
Corn on a cob, hot meals every night
Talk about when I played with hot wheels every night
Motivation, she gave me inspiration
To be what I wanted, she told me be patient
Your day is coming, the teachers didn't believe in me
My momma said the world needed me
And that's why

I'll always love my momma
She's my favorite girl

I'll always love my momma
She's my favorite girl

Kept shoes on my feet
Kept food on the table for me and my brother to eat

All we have is each other, and momma's love is forever
And it will never die

That momma hold me down, till her dying day, I promise I'll make her proud
Real talk!

Life’s a Cycle,From Hood Tales to the Cover of XXL,2010,"It feels good

If I wasn't a gangsta, where would I be?
UCLA, graduatin' with a bachelor's degree
Goin' to grad school to get my master's
Or even fuck around and get a Ph.D
Shit, I could have been a teacher, schoolin' the youth
Or I could have a preacher, healin' people in pews
I could have been a scientist, I do like trees
Or could have been a botanist or your psychologist
Or just a store clerk, ringin' up at your request
Customer service rep with a cubicle and a desk
A jeweler with the best you could find on one's neck
Or part of a company that consolidates your debt
I could have joined the army, could have been a cadet
Maybe the air force, pilot flyin' jets
Either way, I'm just a nigga from the 'jects
92059, but who knows?

Nights like this I go deep in thought till I touch my soul
People say life is a cycle, so I keep God as my idol
But if I try and I fail, I say, ""Get back up and try the next day""
People say life is a cycle, but what do we really know?

What if I wasn't a Blood? Where would you find me?
In the Crip hub with some homies behind me?
Nah, somewhere where the sun is shiny
With my daughter and my unborn son and mami
Somewhere more positive like a plus sign
You know what time it is, it's time to get mines
I can see myself off and help
To the people in need like yourself
I'll probably be a lot more involved in politics
On the podium, sharin' thoughts on Jena Six
Start fundin' millions to NO after Katrina hit
Not takin' no N-Os as a answer for it
I could have completely evacuated the Towers on 9/11
'01, how many died? No one
Now, picture that as the verse colds
Everybody got an opinion, but who knows?


One for the ghetto
Two for the kids with dreams that won't settle for less
I guess it's best that we settle for greatness
Pedal education and throw darts at Satan
You got to excuse my sincerity
Cause everybody out ain't a leader
And apparently you ain't one either
I swear I keep my cerebral so sharp it can cut people
They ball up like a child positioned in fetal
Hey, young world, I got a song to sing
About the dramas and they exist and they kill a king
They want to kill a king, but that first verse was just a what-if
See, I'm a gangsta with a red beam over the Glock
Shootin' shots like a ball team
Your shooters get shot, ten marksmen can all bleed
Now, that's cold-bleed, I mean cold-blooded
That's what Weezy said, and a nigga loved it
Cause I'm 'bout that, took a loss, bounced back

If I Die Tonight,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Verse 1)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Thinkin' nigga might go to heaven fo sho
Never thought about the afterlife, till I start seeing
Most of my niggas losing their life to the streets
Got me thinkin' about all my good deeds
Times that I helped someone that was in need
Seen a friend fallen I put him back on his feet
Gave him somethin' never asked for back, that was just me
Forgave my pops for leavin' us in the streets
Stood my mam on when she was strung out over the D
Never disrespected my elders, never envy
My heart wasn't borned to be jealous, that wasn't in me
Appreciated everyday I woke up to breath
Pray to the man upstairs before I sleep
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Got me really wonderin', I don't know
Damn!
(Chorus)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Heaven or hell, I don't know
If I die tonight, where'd I be
Please forgive me for 
(Verse 2)
If I die tonight, where'd I go
Thinkin' nigga might go to hell fo sho
Could it be, because I sold my own folks dope
Other time that I gave to lil boy that toast
To ride around town and look for niggas to smoke
If you really think about it, it's murder 
All the disrespectful words I spoke
And all the women hearts I broke, I'm not perfect
Remember the days when the nigga was livin' worthless
Gang bangin' and  niggas out of purpose
Cock back  slugs for the hood I love
My brain was cloudy from all 'em drugs
Wishin' death for my enemies
The truth will come out when I drinkin' that Hennessy
If I was really die tonight, where'd I go
To be honest homie, I don't know

"Still (August 13, 2016)",UnKnown,UnKnown,"...used to compromise
Tell em in them interviews I'm not the guy
But I peep it all
I rarely be the one involved
When niggas got so much to say
I barely even speak at all, it keep it all
Stored inside my memory like a sim card
Just me in the streets playing guitar
And this empty Folgers can I'm using as my tip jar
Whether I trip or fall, I know I'll always be at peace
Cuz it was the streets that brought me this far
Duck and dodgin these pitfalls
Rollin over these potholes
Latin women in ponchos introducing me to El Chapos
My Vato
Live and die
LA is the place to be
Red rags and Blue rags, LoLos and new 'Lacs
Foreign whips with the top back
Smokin on that green crack
Deep inside the lower development houses where the fiends at
They high off that good yay
Got em with that good feel
Drunken gang and liquor still
Drunken gang and liquor still
Headed to the liquor store
To get a gang of liquor still
Loaded off that vodka
Lookin for some shit to steal, with the steel

12 O’Clock,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Twelve o'clock on the dot, slugs in my Glock
Rocks in my sock, I'm just tryin' to get guap
Yeah, brick livin', survival of the fittest
Where I'm from in the projects is anybody killer
Goons in the alleyway, goblins on the roof
Ks in the bushes, one time crooked
YGs cookin', OGs lookin'
They tried to rob the spot but they got their life tooken
Young niggas ain't playin', these young niggas preyin'
So many bodies droppin', mama in the church prayin'
Hoes on the track, suckin' and they fuckin' for stacks
Niggas in the trap, dumpin' and they pumpin' them packs
Niggas, they be snitchin', makin' they hard to relax
Double always busy, so I'm constantly watchin' my back
Los Angeles, land of the scandalous
Actin' like you're sweet, you could get your banana split

It's midnight, twelve o'clock to be exactly
If you want it, I can show you where it's at
Make sure you got some bullets in your gat
Fuck, where you fuck-shitters, where you at?
Midnight, wolves lurkin' after dark
In the midnight, sharks are (?)
In the midnight, boy, you better have some heart
Every man for himself when that clock strikes twelve

When nighttime falls, lifelines lost
You can hear if from blocks when 'em four-fives bark
Smoke to get high just to pass time
If I'm low on the dough, nigga, then it's trap time
Work on the saucer plate, choppers by the screen door
Infiltrate, no hesitatin' that is seen, boy
Fuck a narc, fuck a fed, bitches out for the bread
Want to see a nigga right in jail
Crackers tryin' to trap us in the corner, tryin' to put them Ls on us
Watch what's up with them football numbers
Shit, it goes down in the late night
Death in the air, can't imagine what it feels like
In the gutter, we ain't lookin' for no cuddy buddy
Hoes get passed around like drug money
In the land where the man want to see us crumble

Tell Yo Momma,Watts Finest Vol. I,2006.0,"Once again it's on
Hey girl, yeah shake that thong
Afterwards put your name in my Nextel phone
You ain't gotta leave your man alone
Just come to my yard if you want this bone
Take a hit, I'ma have you switching homes
Searching for me you'll be ditching homes
Cadillac truck, yeah sitting on chrome
All debts paid I ain't sitting on loans
Hey ma, I'm loving the way you move
Plus you working it in them high heeled shoes
Yeah I'm kinda tipsy of that gin and juice
Lace the weed a little bit, give my high a little boost
Head to the spot so we can get loose
I wanna pop cherry, I ain't talking 'bout food
You looking so good in that sexy suit
Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you

Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you
The way make it move like a stripper do
Oh, I'ma tell your daddy on you
How easy it is to get next to you
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get wild in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get it hot in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you do your thing in here
Meanwhile, I can keep a little secret, can you?

It's K-D-izzle
T-U-nizzle
How I get down, make moves upon the ground
Stand on the block with the K not the pistol
Fuck with Jay Rock everyday it's official
Seen shorty run away, not invisible
Fuck your mental a nigga love your physical
It's that simple I'll show you what a pimp can do
Put you on corners and have niggas renting you
Like real estate, see a bitch, fuck her face
K.Dot never hate, only dig, penetrate
What you know about that thing cupping your waist
Legs in the air duct tape
Your man  aim straight
Know where the pope went?
I'ma send him to that same place
If you was smart you would touch base, like home run
Then grab pipe when the plumber come


Jay Rock, K.Dot, yeah we keep the place jumping
Girls on floor straight grinding, humping
Subs in the back yeah the speakers straight bumping
Start set trippin' then my boys start dumping
Watts so , chain so icy
Fuck casual, looking smooth in my whitey
Back in the days, yeah them girls they like me
I rolled with Doom Dog, now they all on my cock B

All wanna watch me
All wanna jock me
Take 'em and send 'em straight to bed
When they stop me
Have 'em with sheets over their head, like a Nazi
, head given properly
Wax on, wax off, Mr Miyagi
Let me know momma, I show you where your thighs be
Stick in all the time just like an IV

U Already Know,Watts Finest Vol. I,2006.0,"I'll admit in the beginning I didn't give a fuck about you
You came and you went, thought I could choose living without you
But now I'm feelin' sick cause your ass ain't around
You cheatin' on me (bitch), with every motherfucker in town
I tried to play it like it's cool, but I feel the repercussion
On top of that your ass is rollin' round with my cousin
I think I passed the breaking point cause I done copped a pound
I hear you streaking through nigga's pockets, I'm layin' 'em down
(Gimme that) And I ain't stoppin' 'till you trapped in the safe
Now my base ain't safe so we could skip three states
Switch place after the break, more moves to make
Cause I'm in love with this trap ass bitch called Kate
This  money gon keep me from looking funny
And bummy, let her run me cause she bout it
Monday through Sunday we don't play no games here
You know how we get down, you know all the hoes love me
Money makes the world go round

So I'ma kick in the door
With the Mac 10, or the lone 44
Screaming give me the dough back nigga
Please, don't ask no questions
This a robbery nigga
You already know

Yo pockets kinda thin, shawty wanna go out on a date
Shit I got no chips to spend, but I said it's OK
Cause momma was drivin' the Benz
Her Jimmy Choos had me convinced
I said she was pretty, she love a nigga compliments
I had the thing with me, she didn't know
By the end of the day, she be breakin' off them arguments
I said fuck the ass and titties
I want the jewels and Benjies
I swear a nigga pockets was empty, starving
I whispered to myself, a nigga bout to come up
She like ""Oh I beg your pardon""
Oh nothing, I was thinking bout your valet parking
Excuse me, now give me the  I know they 
I don't wife usually, but today I'll be your man
So we went to the restaurant, I said OK
I think about the getaway shit, over lunch
Like what type of jewels I want, everything
I ain't goin' back to the block 'till her body is clean
Snatch it off her cuticles, takin' off the pinky ring
I know this shit good but it bad as it seems
So hate conversation, little does she know
That nigga like you and me was patiently waiting, give it up
I wanted heartbeat, now thanks for the business
Go home, oh yeah please call me


Yeah, a nigga starving out front of your place
Put the beam to your face, I don't really want the safe
I want everything in your house
From your TVs, couches your dog and your spouse
Everything is valuable, so is you
Cooperate so a nigga won't have to blast you
We all know what this Mac could do
At point blank range, it's a closed casket fool
I'm the Watts bandit, yeah I came up
Put all these goods in a pick-up truck
Rollin' down Central, I spotted me a target
This nigga, he was doin too much flossin'
Yea the truck I parked it
Hop out cock back the heater
Run up in his ass in his beemer
I'm yellin' out, ""hand it over, 'fore it's all over""
Put a shell through you and your mother fucking chauffer
He was looking choked up, so he start sweating'
Looking down the barrel of my Wesson
Yeah he's getting robbed, he know he can't stop it
He gave me the keys, and every fucking thing up in his pockets
Started up the Beemer, parked it where my truck was
Young niggas like ""what up blood""
I'm like what up blood, this nigga came behind me
Said ""hand is over nigga, or that your ass is mine""",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-u-already-know-lyrics

Real niggas do real things
Bitch-niggas, they'll sell their soul for the fame
Even if I'm broke, I'm a roll for the flame
On the block, set-trippin', motherfucker, nothin' changed
Don't get it twisted cause I'm rhymin' on a track
Yeah, I'm the type of nigga leave you dyin' on your back
In a black Cadillac with a diamond in the back
With four grimy niggas with a llama and a MAC
Niggas run they mouth like they can't be touched
'Til them shots go off, leave his ass on hush
Look, his boy got hit, left his ass on crutch
You ain't got no gat, you shouldn't talk so much
Nigga, get caught slippin', motherfucker, that's yo' ass
Got a hundred rounds in it, you ain't runnin' that fast
My advice: get a gat and some niggas
Cause if you talk about me
Then I'm comin' to get you, motherfucker

I don't know what you talkin' 'bout
Don't make me put this in your mouth
That's the sound of a shotty
I can show you how to catch a body, a body
I don't know why you talkin' shit

That's the sound of a shotty
I can show you how to catch a body, a body

This for my 8 Ball 'Ciples, woodgrain grippers
Make the shotty go bang, got to body a nigga
For my 211 hustlers known to dope smuggle, bruh
For the right Jay-Z, I'll rob a motherfucker, uh
I'm from the Hub City, now come fuck with me
I got them bands for sale, I spent a dub with me
My face in the crack, could sniff powder
Them niggas be runnin' the block all through the hours
Fuck it, my nigga, we want that money and the power
If a deal go bad, watch that chopper start choppin'
Tear your whole block
And if a nigga want to hit, I'll box him out like Robin
It's T-O-P D-A-W-G E-N-T until I D-I-E

Ain't a problem so just watch your mouth
(Talk tough 'till we)
Erase your face and take you out (take you out)
It ain't a problem

The game been changed since back in the days
Unfortunately a lot of real niggas being replaced
With all the official niggas that put frowns on their faces
Everytime the m's come on they perpetrating
I guess I grew up different
I can't blame them, my childhood had to revolve around killers
Gangs and drug dealers, weed and cocaine
Which eventually made me who I am today
So I don't pay attention to 'em
I don't ever listen to 'em
I just brush off their loud talk
Play the background waiting for something to pop off
Watch the same nigga run to his car
Lame niggas never saw guns before
Be the same nigga talk about his guns and blow
He be considered a joke
When the hot ovens come out, it's life or death
Cut throat niggas run back to their mom's house
You scared nigga


White folk on the ride
Model bitch on the side
On my lap 4 5
Nigga that's how I drive
In these streets homeboy it's do or die
You wouldn't know because you never came outside
The wise man said actions speaks louder than words
And you clown niggas working my nerves
Hop in the booth say you put work on the curb
Guns in the hood but never took a fate on the turf
But you never mention that when you rapping ya verse
Nah, act tough when you yap on the chirp
Ain't dat some shit, your homies come around and you act like you run shit
Then wanna question my gangsta up on some dumb shit
Don't do that, we won't shoot where your legs is at
It's either your head or the area where ya head pledging at
No allegiance, now breathing under God
Bitch


It's funny how these niggas be so hard on the record
See 'em in the streets, these niggas soft as a feather
Ya'll the ones that be in the club and they get their chain snatched
We play for keeps so I doubt they get their chain back
Plus the ones that talk tough behind the microphone, be the first niggas to run
When the fight is on, them niggas scary and it's easy to see
I ain't calling out names, got caller ID
Niggas want beef boy you know where I be
N.G. projects 112th street look
Don't need to check my resume nigga I'm good
B.L double O D nigga I'm hood
Lifting weights think he solid as a rock
Bet I knock his ass down from a 4 5 shot

And I got 16's that'll make you scream
And my sixteen clips make niggas lean
Had you looking Indian with my red beam


Gat black like charcoal, let off rounds
See the barrel smokin' like a Marlboro
Pushin' coke I ain't talkin' bout soda
Nigga, I'm talkin' bout yola
Breakin' down 
Fiends at the back door, give 'em what they ask for
May I take your order?
I'm a Watts living soldier
From the projects
Keep Glocks in our pants no holsters
Watch what you when you approach us
Get your ass stepped on like cockroaches
Play the game by ourselves no coaches
No father figures, the streets were our Moses
Fake gangstas, I call 'em hoes
They full of shit like toilet bowls
First draft pick now I'm makin' major dough
Now these chickas wanna lick me like an envelope",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-lay-low-lyrics

Nick bags, dime bags, dub bags, gone fast, quick cash
I'm the supplier, get you higher fast
Five-O patting us down now, we gotta stash stacks
My caine you can't match that
Multiple rocks up in my knapsack
Beam on my black gat
You see me on the corner, don't be scared to ask that
Don't be surprised when I ask you where my cash at
Them girls wearing them jeans that show they buttcrack
My bitch can't wear that, why? That's where my straps at
I put the smash down, on any who dare rat (snitches)
I catch you with the cheques you headed for a down trap
Fiends remember my name
And I keep it the same
From January to December I give you a caine
So just light up your thang
Please bring me your bullets

They call me J.R., but I ain't the Birdman Junior
Rollin' up spliffs 'bout as long as a ruler
I'm so sharp like a harpoon
Shirt animated somethin' like a cartoon

Here to hang your neck and hearin' different tunes
That's what that sherm'll do
Settin' up shop like a carnival
Got more bombs than the army, fool
That plenty arsonal
We got that snow in that sunny state
We be chopping rocks for so long, 'til our hands ache
We got connects in another state
You sniff lines? Here's another plate
Just have your fun today
When you grind hard, watch dreams come true
If you ever try to play me, hit you with that semi baby
Have you in a box like two pairs of shoes
With no chest, shouldn't have played yourself

I'm ya supplier man, I'm ya supplier man

When you spark it up, it's gon' put you out

Yes, I'm Cadillac pimpin'
Cooking coke in the kitchen
That judge still want me to stop, I won't listen
Hoes still hot on the block, I'm still pitchin'
White gold all on the watch, cause I'm pimpin'
Something you seen in magazines, so clean
I live my sex life shelltoes, please no cream
Boys keep it calm you know my cup full of lean
I play that game by myself, I don't need no team
Yeah I know I'm cocky, enemies wanna drop me
B-O goin' straight to the top, you can't stop me
Plus I put the pipe in your neck, you can't knock me
Hustle everyday in the streets, 'till cops pop me
See you all running when I'm pulling that TEC out
Say you want beef, well I'll show you what Bo's 'bout
I'm from these streets, so I'll travel the next route
The homies out deep, and they sticking they chests out

I'm ya supplier man, I'm ya supplier man
I got that fire, I promise I'll get you higher, come and holla, and-
When you spark it up, it's gon' put you out

Your man DJ Skee holdin' it down

Next fuckin' superstar of the West Coast
Remember where you heard it first
You can tune in to him, on my radio show
You know we always playin' his shit
Saturday nights, Channel 40
Hip-Hop nation, satellite radio, let's go

It ain't nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze (real talk)
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong don't cherish the weak (gotta have heart)
It ain't nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze (real talk)
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong don't cherish the weak (gotta have heart)

Pull up in the whip, identical black
Two bitches inside, identical racks
Two guns on my side, identical gats
Leave a nigga bleeding fast in need of a pad
Look, when a nigga broke, in need of some cash
I'll hit a house fast, with the heat and a mask
All fingers on triggers, itching to blast
Everybody on the floor, yelling ""Where's the stash?""
 then I'm out split second to dash
Swerving through enemy lines might bust me a cap
Then I pull the car over throw the strap in the trash
Make sure the coast's clear, no signs of the crash
Only the strong survive, when I speak it it's real
Dawg it's real on this field, get killed for the skrill
Got ice on your hand, get killed for your chill
Killer Cali you bastard, keep you a steel


Pull out the Aston Martin
If you talking too much pull out my coffin
Pull out another one for his brother
Real comfortable, even get his favourite colour
I burn rubber off the V12
I fuck international females
My last bitch bitch was speaking some German shit
Catch me vacating on the Germany trip
Eyes red, sandals on like, fuck what Cam'ron said
I'm pecking for the bread
But nothing like a pigeon
I'm something like a vulture
You wanna know how I do it mothafucka I'll coach ya
They call me Phil Jackson
I train your day like Denzel, welcome to practice
Yes I'm the baddest, if my lyrics had looks
This rhyme right here belong in the beauty pageant
J. Brown asked me do I got it, been had it
This beat is pornographic
I fuck off it


Enemy down, left his ass spread apart
Trying to get back to the whip, fuck it won't start
Now I'm on foot back to the turf
Disguised in these colours of this nigga I murked
Hide in the bush, hit the bitch on the chirp
This where I'm at, don't let the ones get here first
So as she pulled up, I jumped in the Magnum
Took my clothes off and burned 'em, after I bagged 'em
I shoot shots through your new era
Have your face airbrushed on a all white new sweater
Before the judge say you're 
I'm jumping out, dumping, let him kill me in a stand off
Please , take me away
At least back behind the car I fire back with the K
That's what it is, fire back where you stay
I spent my whole life trying to climb back with the yay",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-gotta-have-heart-lyrics

Watch 'em cheer in 'em stadiums

Stand over him till he wake up, so he know that's me

What Happen,Watts Finest Vol. III: The Watts Riots,2007,"Yo the boss is back
Off the strip with 10 horses
Town on his back, flawless rap
But check my motives its big checks in the check I wrote it
Hardcore kills raps, spin it back
One flick off the wrist and wahla it is Ab
So if you see the kid napping that don’t mean I took em
That mean the cemetery got to find a place to put em
I think you might have put your hands in the wrong pudding
Or your man ? fucking with the wrong hoodlum
I’m not Bum J but all it takes is one day
Or one hour of recess to lets the guns play
(what happen?) I had to let the gun spray in his direction
Like Raid to an insect, I'm infectin' em'
Straight letting em go like its 8 seconds to go

If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Like, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
But a loud mouth get a entrée of bullets right to the head, shit
Bon appetite, I climb out my window I shoot ya block up then I’m back in the bed, sleep
Back to the business, backpack with blocks all in it
When it comes to beef I’m doing the dishes, shit
More beef then I’m stuck in the kitchen
To stop my trigger finger from itchin’ I’ll probably need a prescription
Plus, I told you niggas too many times, you're not in my division divide mathematician
Counting money like it grow on trees
Matter of fact it do, I got a lawn full of hundred dollar bills, no leaves
My bitch got a blade in her weave just incase mine break she hand one to me
Cataracts I know y’all can’t see I infact I apologize about that

If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Sike, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

I walk it how I live it
Call it how I see it
I don’t live by a script you wanna be whats on the TV
Yeah I’m Jay rock  I’m the one haters love to envy
So I keep burners, busting clips until they empty
Straight to his head til his skullcap is empty
And if I’m ? I’ll be back up in a jiffy with a semi
Smoke his ass fast like a Philly watch the automatic lean his ass back like a willy
I’m silly with the 9 millimeter shot to his bathing ape outfit
Put his flame out quick I’m bout G shit you you, ain’t bout spit
Sniper his ass watch his ass drop unexpected like bird shit
A general so you gotta salute the Colonel
Give you a warning Disobey you gone by the morning
The bullets come free with a casket see
But you broke so you can’t funeral with fear

If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)

Catch me in the hood, blowing on bud
Nigga, fuck your dollar man, I'm all about dubs
Catch me in the kitchen, cooking up drugs
 I'm all for the bubs

I'm all over the stove like pots and pans
Hit the corner with the rock, the Glocks in hand
Rock hold more shells than a taco stand
If I pop, the block hot like a summer jam
Damn, I won't hesitate, to let the pistol whistle
Bullets like many missiles, go straight through your tissue
And your momma yelling, crying sneeze into some tissue
I'm like, damn Rock, you could have worked out the issue
Really hard in the club  without no bodyguards
This where OGs fresh out the penitentiary are
For those who don't know me don't pretend you're hard
Yeah that loud talking shit, that'll get you scarred
Left hook, knock your punk ass on your back
Your head busted, now it looks like the crack of her ass
Then I'm back posting up on the ave
With the homies smoking and joking, counting that cash


I'm like a sound system bump base on the block
Niggas scheming, bulletproof doors on the drop
Well I ain't got a garage, '64 in the lot
In the city of god when they bust at the cops
I stay with a fed, always keep me a bitch
Always holding a crip, always keep me a clip
Yeah, these niggas like  to trip, I'll send them to their destination
To that hot place, you can talk it out with Satan
I'm hot faced, I was blessed with raw game
Bitches fiending for my dick, call me cocaine
In the hood, like tall cans and low daddies
I'm so so gutta like ghetto swords and  alleys
I'm from CA, but some call it killer Cali
Where we banging, get some bitches don't know who their  is
Twist up dro, laid back like recliners
Smoking on five, got me higher than airliners


Yeah it's Jay Rock niggas
Straight out the projects, Nickerson Gardens
DeeJay Dave, I see you my nigga
Fat Boy I see you my nigga
That's how we do it here

Punch line, on the ones and twos
We finna fuck 'em this year

Jay Rock still handle them bills
Watchin' my dollars multiply like Bebe's Kids
I'm fresh plus the watch got a make over
Different colours in the bezel something like Crayolas
I'm from dub city, Dot from hub city
Yeah it's like Pac flowing through my veins, thug in me
I hug semis, hood MVP
All these haters love to envy me, so fuck 'em
Hear my game's proper, I'm bout dollars
Fuck trickin' on a bitch I'd rather buy Impalas
If I gotta pay for it baby I ain't want it
Your pussy probably got a hundred thousand miles on it
With no tune-up, with no oil change
Your best bet put your coochie up for auction mayne
I'm runnin' to the money I ain't stoppin'
Walk around with a stack, that's nothin' but pocket change
Career about to take off like a rocket
When I sell a lot of records you could call it stock exchange
Movin' pounds of that grass, need a weed license
Plus I'm steady gettin' high like the gas prices
If rapping was boxing, I'm Tyson
First round knock out boy, without bitin'
When you gettin' paper
Niggas start to hate ya
You got a problem I'ma solve it call me Perry Mason
I'm from the projects so you know I'm gutter nigga
Keep that Louisville but I'll thirty-eight slug a nigga
When I hit New York you know where I'm at
In the 40-40 club being chic and kickin' back
Walk in Manhattan with my big homies
All in Times Square with the chrome forty-five on me
Then I'm flyin' back to Cali to see my bitches
Then I'm all on Crenshaw, dippin', hitting switches
Then I'm back in the Nickerson Gardens
Fuckin' with big vote and the hit squadron mobbin'
In my black khaki's and corduroys
Been wearin' tees before them franchise boys, you know

I'm a P-I-M-P, rollin' with my G-A-N-G
Doom Dawg got a nigga stackin' my Benjies
A nigga might purchase the Bentley
Cause Warner Brothers made it official
Like a fat man with stripes that's holdin' a whistle
I'm bout to blow, like bad bitches who suck dick
Or like a dynamite stick that's lit
You haters better take cover
Yeah you fuckin' with a Watts living soldier
Yeah the pressure gettin' heavy got the city on my shoulders
I'm not droppin' it for nobody, nobody gonna stop me
I'm like a freight train on a track
Have you dying in pain on your back, from the Mac
Leave a stain on your steps, leave your brain in your lap
And that's what I call a blowjob
Plus this money got the world turnin' like doorknobs
It could turn your good friend to a foe
It could turn your girlfriend to a ho
It could you make you famous, it could make you change up
On your niggas if you let it
Gotta keep Berettas
Niggas comin' at your cheddar
This is '06 so I got brand new raps
Brand new stacks, brand new straps
All new women, brand new batch
Tell me what you know about that, yeah
It's Jay Rock, yeah niggas know my style
Find me on the block strapped with a forty-cal
Come to your spot black mask on the face
Automatic weapons we'll shove 'em in your face
All in your place, take it straight to the safe
Rob you for your cake then leave without a trace
Travel through the mind of a crook, okay you shook

Roaches in the kitchen, so the feds come with the raid

Then snapped like a nigga that's goin' insane
My momma said, ""Grab a coat
You know it's supposed to rain?""
I said, ""Momma, you ain't heard I am a hurricane?""
Katrina with ninas, rob you for your stock exchange
Economy's goin' down, but I'm okay
Got the juice and I know O. J. Simpson delivered the cuts
Listen too hard, it might shrivel you up
Still liftin' it up, this the motherfuckin' get up
Nigga, you ain't fit, look at my motherfuckin' get up
Tell a bitch, ""Sit down"", then tell a bitch to get up
Go and get my monies, suck a dick until you hiccup
Hop out the Martin, jump inside a pickup
Met papi at the doc, give me the work, this a stick-up

When your album comin' out?

Ten thousand for a verse?

Set up shop on your block and have two workin' houses

This is real beef, I suggest you go to In-N-Out
Take it from me, I get aroused by the paramedics
Putin' out stretchers, they help you to breathe
Clear, what, you can't hear?
I'll be back with a drum, stay right here
I'm off Belve and rum, and that shit don't mix
So you can imagine how ignorant I really can get
Straight lunatic, but I ain't Nelly or the Lunatics
I'm ghetto as chicken and beer, this Watts nigga ludicrous
Hello from (?), halo still on your head
That's when I shoot again, cotton heaven straight ahead
Mazda car, (?), where's your bitch? I'm harassin' her


Live from the city of gunplay
Where guns play like kids in a sandbox on Sundays
Only get it one way just like a dude's street
Diamonds on a Blood, but this not a Blue Streak
I ain't got to disrespect a Crip for respect
Matter fact, I'll call one right now, he's a wrap
I told y'all, didn't believe me
I had to bogart from the Nickersons to the Imperial Courts
We go hard, I'm a gangsta still, move keys like Mozart
Low-key like a locksmith on his knees
What you need, I got it, please believe, it's not a problem
Weed or powder, just give me about an hour

This the takeover, my nigga, the wait is over
The game's over, gun range in my Range Rover
I ain't sober, a trunk shot'll lean sideways
A local witness said he flipped off the highway
Catastrophe, if it ain't, it's blasphemy
Killers that blast for me
Bitches that win pageants, they call me Your Majesty
Walk with my pants saggin', puffin' a blunt
Half these niggas ain't half of me
But fuck that, buck back, lay down, this war you ready?
I'm spoken word from a Malcolm X verb, I'm heavy
Feel the wrath of a god emcee
Make it rain thirty songs, that's the god in me
Ain't no guardin' me, this Armageddon for you peasants
I resurrect the rap game after this rhymin' session
I'm a rhymin' ledger, my Ramas'll break depression
Or poppin' a deadly weapon
Or droppin' the top of rappers and droppin' it on the record
Hop in a bubble Lexus
Top Dawg is the future and you lookin' at the Jetsons
I be lookin' at my weapon like ""You son of a bitch""
I squeeze one time, you dump out half of the clip
Now, that's a automatic, faggot, get your ammo up
It don't jam, yo, my ammo get Rambo touch
Get your candles and camos, and smoke on up
Jump out your sandals as soon as that van roll up
And ""Ow"", look what you niggas woke up
A bear with unbearable fight, get your cranium crushed
Titanium bars to bite, turn your teeth into dust, nigga
It's Dennis the Menace, fuck a doctor, call us, nigga
Don't fuck with you fuck-niggas
Fuck with the family, then I'm fuckin' you up, nigga
Tell me what's up, nigga, you dig me? Yeah, strictly
'Bout my paper, throwin' thirties on a scraper
.30-06 complimented by the laser
Paralyze you from the waist down if I graze you, you dig me?
I ride dirty like a bum with lices, that there is priceless
The nicest on these mic devices
Might need both of the mics to (?) where Christ is
A crisis happens after I writes this
A righteous poem been mergin' storms and brightens
The atmosphere with fire, pussy
Gonorrhoea for your vagina, lookee here

Send you to heaven quick call my gat pastor

Incarcerated till I'm faded, let it feed my soul

Look to my left, see a rat with a snotty nose
Yeah, that's the type of shit I'm on
This is where I come from, this is where I was rose
But the floors don't got those
Just heroin needles that stick you in your shoe sole
And you can get your shoe stole

I want the victory to picture me
I can write or recite scriptures from Timothy

Dreams of this paper, dreams of this paper
Ridin' 'round with my middle finger up in the scraper
Middle finger up to my motherfuckin' haters
I'm so serious, but I laugh at you later, aye

So hit your boy up after the club is over


Yeah, we done did it again
Me and Rock 'bout to get those in, so where you at Bo
Hot lines the nicest, got the flow locked down
Like I put it in vice grips
You don't know another spitter that's like this
Call me hot lines, cause I got hot lines, like a psychic
The flow spittin, more better than most
Make it clap for cheddar, like first kings of the coast
If you got it then drop it
Let's see how quick you can break these pockets
The walk is sick, the talk is slick
Don't look her in the eye, she'll talk you out of your chips
Glossy lips, manicured French tip
She addicted to Punch, cause the flow make sense
It make sense, yeah I get that later
Bounce with me one time if you gettin' that paper

Black Rob (Freestyle),Watts Finest Vol. I,2006.0,"It's Jay Rock, born in the heart of  this spittin'
And my bars hit harder than car collisions
My hands still hurt from all that pitchin
I'm still bitching for your dough, like Robin Givens
The Lebron of ours, so I was built for balling
You lazy ass niggas y'all was built for stalling
I'm still standing tall you can't knock me down
I ain't got a lot of weight but I'm packing pounds, get it?
(My name's Jay Rock I'm the man in the streets
If you need that work come holla at me)
Give me some green and give me some white
It's hard times so a nigga might double the price
I'm starving, got damn pockets to feed
On the mic spitting flows 800 degrees
I'm a hustler, nigga, yes I love the grind
Call me Busta, nigga, yes I love to rhyme
Yeah my hand never shaking when I'm holding a nine
Clutch game crazy, like Bird in his prime, nigga
(In these streets gotta carry your clips
If not your a dead ass son of a bitch)
I'm holding more K's than the Ku Klux Klan
You want a head up, you don't wanna see my hands, nigga
Got a jab like Judah that's no lie
Let four fly, all black blowflies
I'm from the projects don't get it twisted
Talking sideways you gon come up missing
Laid back in the truck, rolling up a Swisher
Dot in the back, tea bagged me a sister
(Yeah I'm from Watts and I rep the bricks
If you run your lip, we gon bust your shit)
You could catch Jay Rock on some gangsta shit
On the block with a chain and a   to spit
In the hood with some good  pound of twigs
Rifles, plenty rounds got box of clips
I'm a project nigga I'll box ya 
I'm like pills in the club, I'll pop ya quick
Yeah that rhyme so sick I spit toxic shit
Yeah that flow so golden like a bottle of piss
(It's T-O-P D-A-W-G
It's the new West Coast and we run these streets)
There's no more drive-bys niggas do walk-ups
Spark stuff, leavin' bodies all chopped up
I got nines and a couple of Macs
That'll split a couple of heads and push shit back
I'm from the land where they push that crack
On Compton Ave., all the hoes yeah they sell that ash
You got money go and show your stash
But don't show your ass

Plenty hoes drop plenty off the tops when I'm rhymin' it

Put me on a pedestal, I'll stay up there
Schoolin' the youth, y'all are welcome to my daycare
Strike like a bright match in the night
Attack like a lion when you ain't tamin' her right
Pull my aim to get right to your cranium
Bars are titanium, cocaine from Cuba, choppers from Iranians
Coupe like a UFO, welcome to Alien
I'm E.T. in the GT and I'm rapin' them
Fuckin' them, no Vaseline
Good night, then I'm talkin' them mafia screams
Silent cries of a coward
Kid said it best, gotta kill 'em in the shower
And I don't smoke diesel if the taste ain't sour
And I don't fuck with him if he ain't one of ours
I represent the Towers
Hangin' on a motherfucker startin' on my set gang
Bangin' on 'em motherfuckers
Respect it or check it, I'm nothin' to mess with
Ménage with my bitch and my exes, I'm that cold
Shit, got a bitch that's thick as my bankroll
Puffin' up two Ls, I'm wearin' the Kangol
Draped in gold like I strode by a rainbow
I'll rob Slick Rick, I ain't poppin' big shit
Poppin' big clips, AR, firm grip
Dominique Dawes, make every one of y'all flip
I light the chronic and get high
So high, I can play dominoes with God
Breakin' bread with the disciples and sip wine
Come back down and tell you I had a good time
West Coast dime like the sunset
Don't worry 'bout me, I ain't have a son yet
They pray for my downfall
They want to walk in my shadow like a groundhog
These niggas is Barbie dolls
Bitches with four legs
Before I fuck, shit, I need head
Doin' bad, then askin' you for bread
Rasta, those are the days that I tread
Case closed, right back on the road with it
Pimp shit, whatever I say, she roll with it
Smash a live nation way before Hov did it
Polo Dickies, cut low-low fitted
Low-low on Melrose, tap switches
Eight (?) and Jehovahs bear witness
I was taught, ""Stay with your gun and mind your business""
And windows just glass and niggas will jump in it

Goes on in my hood, goes on in your hood too
Look I'm real sure

Let me tell you all about Watts
Two-elevens, One-eighty-sevens, it don't stop
Shit ain't all great for your mama
On top carry lettuce workin' round the clock
You can't have your gat retired
Get caught slippin' and your life expired
Shit, growin' up, all I seen was drug dealin'
So I wanna live the life of a dope dealer
In the kitchen whippin' like Betty Crock
Sittin' in the spot with a gang of rocks
Clientele pumpin' now the spot is poppin'
Gotta shut it down, yeah them narcs is watchin'
Connect call the church said he got some Os
It might be tapped so we use them codes
Hit your high school just to bang the turf
Sockin' out shit, showin' off for hoes
Your girl know you out there makin' a grip
Hood rat bitches wanna sit on your dick
Now this nigga wanna fight you over a bitch
And they  his bitch out fuckin' for kids
Wonder why niggas lookin' at you funny
Cause you walkin' round with a lot of money
Nigga have the lights up 
Flossin' too hard so he got jacked
Niggas pull up on the side of him
And put about sixteen shots in him
Two witnesses saw the whole action
Police asked, but they don't know what happened
They know that snitchin' is a death wish
So they kept their mouth closed, they ain't said shit
They live by the code of the streets (what's that)
Never ever talk to police (that's right)
Gangstas on their way to a block party
Stopped at the store, gotta get Bacardi
Now they at the party all sauced up
Lookin' for dirty hoes to toss up
Some killers pull up in a Cutlass
Start bustin, and everybody duckin'
It's tragic when the guns stop spitting
Their lives, an innocent victim
And now he's wrapped up in plastic
His momma gotta shop for a casket
His homies don't know who did it
So they ride round town lettin' everybody feel it
Now another died on the other side
Killer Cali, land of the homicide
All we could do, was pray for them better days

First they love, wanna hug you
Get caught in the hype, then they hate you
There to take that ride, they be by your side
When the money right there they for you
When you down and out, when you on that drought
Niggas crumble fast life foil
Even that man, that'll hold your hand
The one you thought adored you
So amazing, when this blazing

And my brother played football down the street
Plus my mother took him in, when his mother was on hands and knees

Raiding spots, took them birds right up out of the coop
Put us in a setback, it was hard to 
Bounce back like juvie, middle finger the cops
I had my index finger on the trig on the Glock
Selling rocks on the block, pitchin' ready to pop
When you're getting paid haters love to say that you're changed

Defense stoppin' them from scorin'
Artest on the roster now
They dread that like a Rastas child

See, we back bigger than ever, back bigger and better
City on our shoulders
Still diehard fans, still Phil coachin'
What y'all thought, thinkin' that we would fall off?
Cause we took that (?)

Bang, bang, guess we're back again
Bang, bang, you know what happen when (?)
It's the bang, bang, a lot has changed since then
And you ain't messin' with them Lakers
It's the bang, bang

What's your prediction on no statistics?
Will it be four or two? Hope he go the distance
Seven games, ah, sweet, what you leanin' towards?
Seen Kobe snatchin' them VP awards
They best player can't spoil with the ""Mamba""
Broken fingers and all, shots still droppin'
Fadeaway crazy, crossover stupid
High flyer, hang time, nuisance
Chuck up deuces, tell 'em, ""Hit the road, Jack""
Energy crazy, bring a chick current back
Shaq dropped a side with Lebron, what a mistake
Now, Mr. O'Neal, tell me how that ass taste
Can't forget about the 'Bench Mob'
Shannon Brown, Farmar, go hard
Luke Walton, Bynum, Josh Powell, that's a cold squad
Sasha, bring it down, tell him that this player called


Go 'head and line it up
Soon as the buzzer go off, tell 'em they time is up
Time and time again, they fall short of the glory
Tryin' ball with Gasol, that's another story
Cause he can dish it to Odom, I ain't jokin'
Phil Jackson don't even have to make a notion
To get the game back in motion, peep the triangle
Fisher (?), lose your faith and your ankles
See, it's as easy as Sunday mornin'
Seen what we did to Phoenix, that's a fair warnin'
A fair shot before the shot clock
You shot brick and my shots drop
That's why we dominate all opponents
Boston Celtics gon' get dealt with
And if you dare place your bets, yes, I condone it

Watts Finest, Top Dawg ENT
Do it nigga squad
Wassup, I'm feelin this right here
My nigga Punch on the one and twos
Come on, let's go

Pants still saggin'
Rock red flaggin'
Catch me in the streets
With a red Dodge Magnum
Look, you haters better dodge magnums
I ain't talkin' wagons
When they start blastin'
I'm still hungry, no thoughts of fastin'
Stackin', Rock wanna donut the Aston
Take a bad bitch put coke all in her ass and
Send her on a trip come back with all the cash man
Takin' out them garbage niggas, I'm the trash man
Bitch I'm a father figure, them mothers lackin'
The Nickerson Garden niggas who stop askin'
White t, khakis nigga now that's fashion
Been through that bullshit killer, hear the static
Shotgun pumpin' my mattress for action
On Jackson just clappin'
No actin' you bastard
One shot dillinger killin' ya, you passin'

It's young J-A-Y
Rock, a real stand up guy
And if you see him in the streets ridin' by
Don't be shy, through your sets up high
You was gangbangin', yeah me too
Oh you sold drugs killer, yeah me too
Oh plus you hug triggers, yeah me too
I know, I know, I know, yeah me too

Men die on Figueroa
Nigga tryin' to pimp a whore
Handcuffin' these hoes is not up in our repertoire
Tryin' to get cheddar boy
Move with the metal toy
Mind playin' tricks on a nigga
Like the Geto Boys
Got what you need, yes indeed, still sellin' boy
Crack next to weed, Bobby Boucher, water boy
Keep the poker on me I ain't talkin' bout 
Shit, that'll have your ass screamin' for the ambulance
Bloods and Crips still at war like in Pakistan
Keep a lot of shells on me nigga, like a taco stand
Seen the hardest nigga thinkin' that he macho man
Got his ass crunched down like a nacho, damn
 problems my little homies hit 'em up
I ain't talkin' bout beats when they  him up
On this rhyme you boy had to switch it up

You kill me, come back to life and end your's

Even when I'm not working,

Spittin’ in the Whip,UnKnown,2009.0,"I'm from the L.A. Times side, the L.A. crime side
Long-term might be homicide
Used to move with them Rugers
Talk shit, we shoot you at your dice game
Rob you for your moola
It's like that, cash rules everythin'
Fiends' strung out, so they try to sell you anythin'
Listen, son, I never sold crack for fun
I was hungry, shit, I sold crack for funds
Had to get my weight up, enemies' sprayed up
Got with it a whole brick, then we re-up
Sittin' in the money spot, cookin' up the product
Try to infiltrate the shop, you got shot up
Little kids in the projects, they want to be us
No father figure, there's nothin' that you can teach us
Yeah, the streets raised us, blowin' weed and 
Gangbangin', paint slangin' for decimals
Yeah, and I'm spittin' in the whip
Yeah, it's Jay Rock and I'm on my shit
Me and  gettin' them long checks
Well, I'm ridin'  straight to Watts, it don't stop
Sounwave in the back chillin', I'm in New York chillin'
And I'm tryin' to get a million, better yet, a billion
So I can buy me a buildin'
You know how it go, Jay Rock
Chillin' right here with Crazy Al Cayne
You know it don't stop, yeah, the boy's insane
Straight off the top, you know I'm representin' Watts

Can’t Stop,Watts Finest Vol. II: The Nickerson Files,2006.0,"Intro
DJ Skee, World Premier
A nigga just be curious though right
What be going through your mind since this shit starting to like, pop off and shit, you know what I'm talking about?
Man too much shit man
Niggas just trying to maintain, you already know how it's going though
Keep they head up
Keep it pushin'
(Verse 1: Jay Rock)
Sitting in a butlass
Smoking on weed, watching Phillies turn into roaches
I'm just posted, watching my homies argue about whose flow is the dopest, Big or Pac
But I'm just thinking about my next dollar, my neck smooth
Trying to find my roll to the top
On my way to my block still stressing
My little homie die, they say every death is a lesson
If so I thank the lord for my blessings, even though I never seen him
I know he watching me as I'm stepping
Big homie told me never leave without the weapon
He don't want to see me in a casket in front of a reverend
I told my girl I'm trying to be a better man
And if you love me then you would understand
I know you forgave a nigga for what I done in the past
I love you but baby I'm in love with my cash
You say, all money ain't good money
But shit, some money is better than no money
And plus my momma needed help at the house
So I went into a spot and moved that package in and out
Came home, stuffed the stack up under the couch
Now I'm thinking to myself she'll find it there
Now I got a little paper, bitches stop and stare
They offer me head, want me to swim in it bare
Look, that's how they trap a nigga, that's why I strap it nigga
Jay Rock not trying to be an absent nigga
Might have to clap a nigga with a .38 special
Wet a nigga up like good coochie
Roll a nigga up like a tootsie roll for fucking with my cash flow
My big homie two T said I got next, but I feel like i got right now
I got the right style, the right sound, dog I'm so hood
If I don't have a gat best believe you'll get socked down
Gangbanging shit that was my lifestyle, ask gang
He gon' tell you hands down Top Dawg Ent chain see you looking
NG projects I'm repping to the fullest
Hold your tongue before your mouth catch a gang of bullets
I ain't gotta pull the trigger, my gang will do it
Dog I'm so gutter, similar to the sewage
I'm so fresh bitches always see me in my newest
Trying rob boy better think twice stupid
Clip full of arrows, shoot straighter than cupid
Still cruising through my city with my .45 close to me
In the front seat, right where it's supposed to be
I'm never slipping, real niggas know what time it is
Sitting at a light might be your last night to live
Real talk gotta have street smarts
Some niggas ain't ready to die, man they ready to kill

Tim Westwood Freestyle,UnKnown,2018.0,"Look inside the eyes of the real niggas
Crack babies, NyQuil, been the drill niggas
Yeah we been in this field nigga
I pop my collar like I'm pickin' cotton, catch the steel picture
Ain't no business nigga like show business
Don't lose sight when you tryin' to handle your own business
In that new addition, Forgiatos candy-painted gleamin'
Smoke tinted, two straps with some dope in it
Two hundred on the dash, tires screechin'
Thrive huh? Gotta live through the four seasons
Last year was cold, it left my soul grievin'
This a game of life and death, and ain't no cheatin'
That's why I keep the hammer in the pants
We don't turn down fades we can tango
Anything else after that get a rain coat
Bullets ain't got no name they sing the same note
I used to walk inside that shack, quarter packs
Vengence upon 'em, I wonder miss a total rap
This blood on the East Side, embedded stones on my slap
Chopper style strap, impressive I bring the grinders back, yeah
It's all or nothin', shovin' hundreds through the laundromats
Nevermind the stats, four to twenty where my lament at
I did a lot, I ain't takin' nothin' back
So it's fuck you if you don't love it, let 'em run with that, yeah
Every now and then I'm blackin' out
Like Edison on the first when you ain't cashin' out
This redemption is worldwide, respect the passion now
Whippin' them new foreigns guess we lashin' out
I drip blood of a slave, Shaka Zulu in the flesh
?'s in my eyes, I ain't sippin' qualitest
Quarter million in my pocket, now they wanna test?
A few dollas, that'll have them guarders at your neck
I know some hyenas go fast like jets
Bullets to your chest so fast like ""catch""
'Cause when you boomin', hands out like you owe somethin'
You was broke and bummy they ain't let you hold nothin'
Got that chopper ready, steady hold a whole hunnid'
That's for them haters, out there tryin' to take my soul from me
And god don't like ugly, you can't control nothin'
That's for them haters, out there tryin' to take my soul from me
Either pray or play for your team, red or blue
Make sure you got bleach to get rid of that residue
No chill, dealin' with rule-breakers and vandals
Blowers in the bando, fitters with the flannel
East Side Johnny and them, a bunch of have nots
Out to reinforce the black top, watch the backdrop
I represent from that Nickerson aspect
You ain't down to toss the dice for your self? You side bet, yeah
We live threats, gotta flip, take it off
Fuck 'em all, gotta ball, we stuck in that mind set
In the belly of the beast, is some shit you can dissect
Food for thought, this reality, some shit you can digest
They feel some type of way, oh yeah, we see the curve
Ray Bans on in the summer, and then we swerve
East Side shit, nothing is by the book though
And I ain't prejudge, just keep your ears to the truth though
Yeah, yeah, I'm the truth, hoe
Yeah, yeah, shoutout to Migos",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-tim-westwood-freestyle-lyrics

I like this shit right here
Yeah, Jay Rock
Top Dog Entertainment, yeah
You know I gotta keep it gudda on this one, nigga
Cause that's what I represent, motherfucker
I'm going in

Look at me now, they loving my name
Applying pressure, Jay Rock crushing his game
You up in my lane, then it's a must you be slayn
Fake niggas yell out my name to honor some fame
Shame y'all lames, my bars are vivvid
Your's are scripted, Jay Rock fact, you fiction
Cocked back, blast you missing
Bash bitches, kill tracks so severe, no chance for stitches
Solid, don't fold, won't stand with snitches
Seen the police, the land man and prison
Damb, I'm from the projects, the land of killers
Got pumps like Ark, get your mans a fill up
Like a screwdriver, I'm a true rider
Can't deny it, city surviver
I'm still hungry, treat the block like a potluck
You bring your dish, I eat your shit
I'm bout it bout it, Rock used to rip hives
Got weed, pushing water like riptides
I love the south, they rock chains and cars
I'm from the west, all we do is pop things and rob
Shit I'm like Mac 10, I bang and bomb
For my fans, I shit on you fakes and frauds
This is Top Dog Ent, he next in charge
Run your mouth, fuck around, put your life on pause
I'm too gudda, when it come to my stacks
Hit the hood, make it rain, and I'm snatching it back
I'm a playa, fuck 1 bitch, I'm snatching a batch
And we at the hotel, put the stick down they back
Yeah watch counting 
Pants sagging, red ragging, and I'm holding my gat
Cause niggas out here, thinking I'm pussy
Till I cock back, leave they fuckin head mushy
Too rough, like a couple of O's
Do a couple of shows, do a couple of hoes
And we still cooking up, D work in my stove
Got a frunt Chevy thing, if they kick in the door
Them apple bit boys wanna throw us away
Them fake niggas, dog better watch what you say
Cause them boys steady taping, recording your calls
Catch a nigga like that, then I'm out in the mall
Got dollars, sitting on a pot of gold
The money coming, the money running, like a snotty nose
Tryna snatch, Imma clap, leave your body froze
Knock your fuckin head off, when the shotty blows
I gotta keep it gudda dope
Stay eating, cause I got that bread and butter flow
And you know I never studder though
Watch what we do it for, G, go on, tell them, bro

They think I'm selling dope, no, I'm selling I'm selling 
They want this 32, fuck all that taking turns
Bitch I'm ball hogging, there's too much gass to get
Call me Kobe Bryant, I ain't passing shit
Motherfuckers snitch, a nigga tryna score
And if I miss a shot, believe I'm back for more
You niggas after whores, you acting dick
Dressing like a bitch, jeans tight as shit
There ain't no tighter Crip, Rock the king of Bloods
Yeah west coast 
Don't believe my words, stand back and watch, cuz
On my dead homies, we finna run this bitch
And if my disks don't sell, rap niggas run your shit
I'm taking magic plates, and I  them nigga
Talking magic 
You best believe the hype, G the grimiest
Why the fuck you think Mac 10 signed me, bitch?
If it was up to bars, he would've signed Krit
One of the hardest stars, 
I bet a couple niggas  grab his hand and shook it
Album bout to drop, niggas ain't pushed it
You feeling like a pussy, how that feeling feel?
A couple deals later, I'm at 
At the Top Dog, man this a little loanly
So I spit this lil verse just to help the homies
 this my cocky run
Cause death the only thing that's gonna stop my shine
I refuse to let another nigga stop my grind
Long as my vocals fresh, I'll make them press rewind
Since I'm pressed for time, I'm bout to kill this bitch
That's how you do a track, tortured and kill a bitch",https://genius.com/Jay-rock-freestyle-lyrics
