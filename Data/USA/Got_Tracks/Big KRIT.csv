Yea Shawty
This the K.R.I.T
Out of Mississippi
I'm from 30B

I met a fine yellow bone outside of this club
Hangin' with her friends, came up and showed love
I'm intrigued by the scene and the crowd seen you 
You got the rainbow louis with the belt and the hat
She seem independent to me, and that's cool
'Cause I ain't trickin' on no broad, and that's a rule
Look at every fine woman as possible clientele
A little conversation got digits to her cell'
I can tell she astounded by pimpin' that I spit
It only took a second, she starting to go deep
Asking me about my past and how I made cash
How much did it cost for grain on that dash
Straight to the sub, she tellin' me how she love it
Sayin' I'm her type, I'm nothing like all the others
I tell her ""Broad, I ain't tryna' be a player
But I ain't captain cook on a hoe, I can't save her

Yeah Shawty
You think you playin' on me?

I'm a P.I.M.P

Out of Mississippi
I'm from 30B

I hit the  when she creepin to hoes with no shame
She talking much knowledge, I bet you she give brain
Do flicks to make change, however she make dough
You taking her out to eat, she sliding down stripper poles
The pro's they all know that your girl I spoke
And she fucking with other niggas but 
Pussy poppin', head bouncin' - bitch, break it to the floor
Said ok, tellin me ""Don't let anybody know""
I got dough, I do tracks since she heard that I'm a star
Caught a  while I was getting out my car
, Everclear, probably sippin' on some Barre
Think I'm buying a drink, just because I'm living large
 is enough, I could never trust a broad
Buying shit for other niggas, maxing out my credit card
Never that, settle back, I'm a P.I.M.P
Who you think you fucking with? This the K.R.I.T

Yeah Shawty
You think you playin' on me?

I'm a P.I.M.P

To get ya back I do whatever it takes

To get ya back I do whatever it takes
Don't do it, don't give a nigga up like that
Don't do it, don't give a nigga up like that
I was gon' get right back
I was gon' get right back

I did you wrong I hurt your heart and I apologize
Wish I was  cuz I can see with no other guy
I wouldn't have left them other hoes alone if I didn't care
Last night I came home and you wan't there
I blame myself for all the tears that you cry shawty
I did this music cuz I knew that you would ride shawty
We talked all about the tour dates and pre-shows
You said you wouldn't be concerned with all them groupie hoes
But then you start trippin' fighting with me actin' funny paranoid thinkin that you seen me with another woman
I though you didn't trust me so I made a grave mistake
I met up with a shawty that I knew around the way
But now it's too late, yeah and the damage done
The weight  do you wrong is on my shoulders and it weighs a ton
But I can't take it back but what we had I can't lose it
I'm crying out just like this track baby don't do it


I tried my best did my best wasn't good enough
3 years shawty why the hell you givin' up
You're mamma told me that you cry 'bout it every night
Friends remind me when they see me that I wasn't right
You never miss something good till it's gone
Without you in my life girl this house ain't a home
This music ain't in me and the money ain't worth it
When it was me and you we were oh so perfect
Ay this is real, this is now, this is how i'm feeling
No worries, just chilling thats how we be living
But now the shits twisted
And yee ain't gettin' back
I threw away what we had but I can get it back
And all you need is time
And imma be around
I'm only human and I'm sorry that I let you down
But I can't take it back, but what we had I can't lose it

Why a sucka nigga hating plotting up on livin' lavish
Sucka free best believe that's some shit to claim

I was teachin' young Dre to  one into two
I'm the realest I know in and out the booth
Cuz I been done the shit that y'all tryna do, Yeah

The bitch you with now I bust her in 92

Pull out the freshest T I got and 
throw my Forces on

My mind frame is country, so country is all I know
Reach my grandma in my morning, she swear I don't get rest

Wants me to cut my chin hair and fix my pants
I tell her just who I am and eventually she'll understand
Grab the door knob, with the (?) on my own
While some return home, but mostly remain gone
In that street war, where surviving is so irrelevant
The only representation I got is them dead presidents

My music bumpin', years ago I was onto something
But what do I do my nigga? Truly I'm only country
But that was then, this is now, and was forever
Is my own go in stride to find me something better
Then what lies beneath me, increasing my interviews
While labels calculate my net-worth and revenue
I speak for the hood, ghetto thinking, and ghetto livin'
I embody the ghetto people and ghetto children

And a lame ass nigga all in my face
And a bad young shawty wanna give me a taste (hold up)

Cup full of lean and I'm lean two step
You know I ain't from round here shawty I'm on some classic shit
Hit the club with the  straight nasty chick
Have you ever seen a playa so fly
I pull up to the club in a 745
You know I ain't from round here shawty I'm on some classic shit
Hit the club with the  straight nasty chick

Say the K-R-I-T your favourite rapper
Cuz he keep it real and he far from actors
Two step his way to the top with no crashing
Meet a hoe greet her and fuck her in pimp fashion
Nigga didn't know that his girl gon' turn
She admires my clothes my car my shoes
 on the 'lac know that K's the best
I'm a hustler til' i'm rich get them lames a cheque
Nigga talk a lot never really man up

Ginger bread paper, get it fast as I can
Ears to the streets cuz the streets don't lie
Real recognise real and yo' credentials don't apply
Still warmin' up playa y'all ain't ready to ball
Better go talkin' hard before I have to choke you off


Allow me introduce myself, young Krizzle in the flesh nigga
Colder than a northern blizzard, flyer than a jet nigga
Straight up out the dirty dirty where we put it down
I represent the M, ville and the Jack-town
Sippin  shawty, rep it like it spo'd to bleed
Might as well label me, king of Mississippi
I'm on my grind daily and the hood folk raise me
See Me On Top got the internet crazy

I run my city, I’m an arrogant nigga
You say I’m tight, I’m like I already know
You think I’m tight, I’m like I already know

At the bottom cause it ain’t for a g
Like my music ain’t been bumping since 2003
Like I ain’t been one of the realest that spits for the gangstas
The pimps, hustlers, and trappers, and the boys with them swangers
A-1 strapped up, lean in my cup
Lames hating on the K but I don’t give a fuck
Move wit it, jig wit it if you gots to
 love me and they dig me so they gon to
What it is ho? What it look like?
I got that crick crack shawty and it’s whipped right
Boys think I’m playing just because I ripped the beat
Even  know that killer K will wreck a beat
I been affiliated ever since Mr. C
I was round here, big down here, hustling off in these streets
So you can miss me with that rap shit partner
Cause when shit hit the fan my folk resort to them choppers


We’ll take the compliment, I know I’m the talk of the town
Wherever I hang around, that’s where it’s going down
Best believe it, I ain’t conceited, I’m confident
I don’t need to keep the heater with me but it compliments
My gangsta, so toughland don’t tough it out
Turn a ruthless nigga to a buster when I bust it out
Leave a nigga laying in some lean with his face flat
Just cause he was playing when I ain’t playing, nigga take that
And that’s that, understand I’m a Jackson
Egghead nigga think he hard but I cracked him
Wonder why I holler “I’m the best” and the scene drop
When I spit at they team, they whole self-esteem drop
Now he all humble, walking round with his tail tucked
Yeah he comfortable now, but I can make it hell bruh
He ain’t wanna fight, he just saying what he could of done
I got some advice for you, duck when the bullet come


Word is killer K about to infiltrate the game
Cause everywhere you go you hear a player say his name
I got the hood jumping, we set the streets on fire
Ay it’s a wrap, even Tad screaming more tired
Here I am, long awaited with another one
Did one that was banging, J Obie got another one
King of the queen, that’s a hell of a title to call myself
But I done proved that a thousand times and nothing else

Standing ovation, Deezy said it best
I sleep when I die, so ain’t no need in getting rest
Bet I’m up tired, that’s such an easy investment
I stand on it till the day that I stand corrected
See I’m the best you done seen in a long time
I keep a fresh book so now I got a strong mind
I miss the heat, this the AK get a best seller
Stack my paper higher than the ceiling, ask my bank teller",https://genius.com/Big-krit-i-already-know-lyrics

Lifestyle of rich and fame, yeah I'm destined to see
I'm on the road to the riches, like I'm expected to be
No Tom Hanks, but I'm still getting my mail
I'mma die while I stamp, yeah I'm sending to jail
Cause all a hater live for is to see me bail
Like 'See Me On Top' wasn't expected to sell
Watch you shake your damn head at every bar I spit
That shit man you could see how far I get
I'm a mainstream nigga, but I'm far from commercial
I speak from the streets, and that's far from commercial
A local ass nigga with world wide flow
A small frame nigga with some big back doors
A humble ass nigga with a Christ like passion
Get my folk up out the hood and give blood to the bastards

When they hear that new Krit
Yeah the hood 'gon go crazy
I said the hood 'gon go crazy
Yeah they did my swag
The street'll love me, and I'll love them back

Said they dig my flow, the whole world love me cause I'm
Bout my door

Aye I represent for the nigga that ain't got shit

Born and bred in Mississippi, they relate to my story
Rebel flag flying, man fuck that shit
White sheet on their head, white chick on my dick
The whole world love the K, that ain't hard to see
So your shit got fed, nigga pardon me
Now you say you make beats, but none of them yo' tracks
Never seen yo' shit when I was in 'Illracks'
I'm on tv, never heard of you nigga
So don't be surprised if I ain't heard of you nigga
Word is that K emerged from a crack in the streets
Gave dope with the flow, mixed the crack with the beats
Words come to worse man, I go platinum at least

I ain't got time for these niggas out here that's steady hating
 just copped them Chevy so knock us niggas skating
Hip hip to the end of this expedition that we've been taking
Headed down to Jackson just the see what the fuck was shakin
I told them niggas I'm the realest of the real
I've got that gangster, gangster, gangster of grills
So a nigga wanna know bout me from the 3OB, that block I'm from
Where niggas don't play around  spray around  got them guns
See what I mean my nigga, see what I'm saying cuz
While you was running yo mouth we out here making bucks
Turn on TV screen and see CT300 on BET
We at the block on the 12's  diamond and DVD
I been a G forever forever that's what I be
I turn this G style like a bitch that wants to fuck with me
Too many niggas done fell victim tryna battle me
Why have you got the life that  cavalry
Pull up run up cut up cut up watch me get deep up in em
And keep going going going like hood cat spitters
You niggas is uptight like a broad with some fucked up extensions
I know more niggas with white than a triple K convention
Back again shawty shawty with all that crunk shit
Make a nigga girate and fall out just like all that crunk shit
Know men know me K.R.I.T yeah I put shit down
The only mainstream martyrs thats still underground
Follow me to the South, follow me to the streets
If you can't keep up my nigga follow me on the beat
I got a reputation for wreckin and that's for sure
I got the game in a choke hold and I ain't letting go
I'm on a mission familiar player I stop for nothing
Unless there's dimes on my side and they steady twerkin something
They know they quote it the poet yo guess I'm bouts to blow
I love this music but truly nigga i'm bout my dough

And the boys wanna know about the 
About that grand on the wheel that would

After him you retire nigga that's you're future
Everybody wanna know where the K gon' sign
If the independent pays man then K won't sign
Rather stick to the streets cuz the streets is real

I'm like  do bad all by myself
Got my own fuckin' label I sign myself
Cuz the broke don't shine, the dead don't breath
Close your mouth all you want me but I'm gon' eat

Went a hundred miles per hour  crash
Make tracks and write fire nigga I'm

Dig my vibe and they love my story
Went from no name nigga to the next one in it
But this is far from fixin' this the life I'm livin'
Ask  he'll tell ya yeah we run
Told me to skip breakfast go straight for my dinner
Took my napkin  tight and sit down with the greatest
I'm the last of my kind I belong to this table
Hey you, you ain't never seen nothin' quite like it
Eighteen spittin' fire nothin' quite like it
So let's take it back to the blocks and the rubber bands
No jewels no necklace just a rubber band
Flier than a 7-47 nigga
I'm the doc of the bay like Otis Redding nigga
Waitin' on my spaceship like one day

Have you ever seen these shoes
Cut the small talk I love the way yo body move

And we can do the same things that the couples do
Eyes closed legs open when a playa fucks wit you
I know you dig it so the nights on
Say you wanna fuck good long and hard with the lights on
Yeah you like to watch but we can make it happen
This night'll never end shawty if you keep it clappin'
Slow it down for me baby girl give it up
Pop it on me like you still dancin' in the club
No rules for the night woman do yo thang
Ay I'm a freak shawty go and spell a playa name
Long breaths take  make ya back bend
Hit a playa up and we can do it all again


Ay, it's picture perfect how I'm swerving
Top drop to the bed like
Now these hoes don't know how to act right
Ay I'm a gift to the slab in the streets
The grind and the hustle the block and the freaks
Shawty's from all over know the swagga of a pimp
They just gravitate to me cuz I don't jab her like a simp
I gets my grown man on but I'm young at heart
I'm on some Ferris wheel shit like an amusement park
When it comes to that mouth piece the K's a monster
You just mad cuz you're shawty wanna be on my roster
Killer  motivate a chick to get her stacks
Hit the track oh playa this should bring it back
With no emotion wedding bands or them strings attached
She can be herself around me ay I never hold her back

My presence is dirty dirty so respect my grind mayne
I shatter hater with flow that's so much greater
If I don't sign today I still be gettin' my paper
In this music I been  focused on major and niggas known it
You will acknowledge my talent, them haters too scared to show it
I owe it to all the folk that saw it in me
Those few that kept it real but I promise those few ain't many

I gotta hustle daily, take care there's nothin' left
They said I'd never make it, they said I'd never blow
Now I just chunk the deuce and dream of 24's
Shawty I gotta go, I see you when I see ya
Out of these non-believers, I gotta make believers
I never been a follower, I always been a leader
That's why I sell this music like trappers sell coke out (?)

I want that good life, I'm talkin' dope money
Without the jump-out boys, snitches, and long gunners
I'm sayin' I need millions like I need breath
And we don't run 'round youngin' (?), we take steps
Trying to avoid death, anything for a rep
No college degree but we be the hood chefs
Takin' from the hood until there ain't a hood left
Searchin' for chickens to give up they goodness
For a little change, she'll give you a little brain
But if she catch you slippin' brains on your woodgrain
And this a hood thing, don't think you can't get got
And just cause you're paid, don't think you can't get shot
I show you what it's like, to live a hustlin' life
You'll be the king of your city, that's if you hustle right
Don't be a lame nigga, listen and pay attention
Play the game until you're winnin', that's how you make a livin'


I swear to tell the truth, my hand on my heart
The pain in my brain, the struggle in my thoughts
My momma on my mind, know she prayin' and hopin'
Hundred dollars away from being broke but we copin'
I got my window open, my city never sleep
It ain't no turnin' back from head-first in the streets
You know that grit-ass game, yea I'm in it deep
My heart pumps soldier blood through me when it beat
My new shit gonna make the trunk rattle when it beat
I don't slang it but I can show you where to get it cheap
I don't know you and you don't know me either, so we even
But I'm willin' to die for everything I believe in
It ain't no better feelin' than seeing my daughter smile

A couple of octopussies here and all the crabs at the bottom

Where hip-hop is still alive and rappers still have morals
Based on the game, they saying, ""we won't change""
Like, the South just booty and we ain't got no brain

It Was All a Dream,Hood Fame: King of the Queen,2006,"It was all a dream I used to read Murder Dogg magazine
Wanted to be a dope boy so I could ride clean
Fuck boi ya'll ain't playing no stunts
I went from ashy to classy in only ten months
I'm starting to think I wasn't built for this planet
As a child momma told me I was just too mannish
Lost Annie May in '95 was a hard summer
Miss  was like a mother I'd die if I lose another
Ain't been to church in a while so they say I'm vile
Fuck them I still pray and I pay my ties
Besides the only one that roots for me is the Lord
I'm a gladiator baby I'mma die with the sword
If they turn their back on me cause I spoke from my heart
I just pack up my shit and take a trip to Mars
Cause a hustla gonna hustle forever
Since it's hell on Earth I got the nerve to say good bye to the devil

Can I live?
Ya'll niggas don't see my dreams
I hustle all night just to get more cream
Can I live?
Ay papi I need them things
Put crack on the track like habit to the fiends
Can I live?
Drop top Chevy's and coupes
Polo clothes with the polo shoes
Can I live?
Trophies, awards, diamonds, and plagues
It's all good but I need them stacks go and get this crack

I just want it in the worst way
Copped my first pair of J's in the 10th grade
Sold some stacks to get games for my PlayStation
Papa never knew about it told him I was saving
Tired of living in the shadow of my brother
Started hanging with some O.G. that told me just be 
It's kind of hard to see the light without the darkness
I'm through with excusing niggas and begging bitches pardon
Win or lose young man only time will tell
You'll be surprised how many lames wanna see me fail
Never been secure pimpin' always been a mover

One day you're here next day you're gone

Niggas see you on that block, Niggas knowin' what you got
Don't think your ass can't get shot
One day you're here next day you're gone
Everybody ain't your friend, everybody ain't your foe
You gotta watch em' from the door
One day you're here next day you're gone
Some of these people out here burnin'
Don't let haters hear concernin'
Don't take more than what you owe
One day you're here next day you're gone
Just keep your feet up on the ground, and your head to the sky
Thank the lord your alive
One day you're here next day you're gone

Its like I'm trapped on the porch I was raised on
Day in day out its like the same song
And all my folks know that I'm real about it
And that ish too many niggas gettin' killed about it
And I cannot make paper workin' 9 to 5
I gotta hustle but it really ain't workin' out
And when them fiends come, so quick divide them dimes
Then them narks come so quick and bust our grind
I ain't trippin' cuz' I'm still lookin' towards the future
And I'ma eat as long as they keep makin' Ramen Noodles
And I don't mean to act like we ain't really gettin' paper
But I'm here to tell all my players it gets greater later
Back in the days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore
Some days I say I wish I was a kid again
I hope I'm not losin' y'all when I do these songs
Somedays like sometimes I feel like I can't go on
One day your here next day your gone


I'm back again like I never left
And I ignore the pain and struggle like I never felt
I roll around with my folk, they got them 20's man
Then I go home and realize just how poor I am
But I ain't jealous, I ain't trippin, cuz' I'm gettin' mine
Ain't like the lord forgot about me he just needs some time
Look I ain't gonna preach to you like these other guys
Man I ain't been to church in months but I still pay my tithes
A dollar here, a dollar there it ought to make it better
Cuz' I'm aware that I ain't gonna be on this Earth forever
If I don't make it to the top cuz' of bad direction
Maybe DJ Screw will chop my cd up one day in heaven
Plenty niggas been here, plenty niggas gone
Plenty niggas doing time never comin' home
And to my niggas in the struggle grindin' hard stay strong
Cuz' one day you're here shorty then the next day you're",https://genius.com/Big-krit-one-day-2006-lyrics

New day and era man, new flow

I like this shit right here, it's real smooth
(I't's real outside the box) Check this out

Breathe with me, the wait is over (ah)
 deserve the crown you're holding, yeah
The future lie behind my Cartier lenses
I do me great so fuck your  pimpin
Rather stick to the streets and the code
Outflow a nigga damn near thirty years old
Not to be boastful but I'm so focused
Folk knew I was blowing way before I wrote this
My debut, I skate through
They love me so much that they must hate you
I call you're shawty Wednesday you call her your boo
She give me mouth to south and still dates you
I call it how it is, speak it how I see it
Too many kept  sparks in these regions
OG's taught me, told me don't save em
It's something like video games you just play em
Like

They say we're trafficking
We say we trappin'
They like, I blew by accident
They gone hate but they don't know
They hate, they hate, (don't know)

I went from nobody to that next nigga
I went from no shine to diamonds on my neck nigga
It's a level of respect nigga
That I get from trap stars, hood hoes and them vet niggas
I speak when they ain't speaking
Touch the hearts of those they ain't reaching
I'm a hood 
I sit in the poor pit
And if it ain't about money then I bet it's on some bullshit
Ain't I bulshittin' either people
Either you catch ghost or that Pac man eat ya
Sliding deep in the game like wet wet
Mo fire, Mo hoes, Mo latex, safe sex
I take  for 06 & 07
I'm paradise with the flow my shit is so heaven
Heavenly father wait on me
The same reason they hate on you is why they hate on me
They don't believe

A king by air anytime anywhere
Aye a parking lot pimp so all the dying bitches stare
Yeah I'm bumpin' Big  just incase a nigga tussle
I'm a countrified  player motherfucker
I got that debonair bonafide pimpin'
Type of flow that rustling hoes into submission
Got it in the kitchen, cookin' up a feast
I'm  plus a underground beast
Everywhere they know me, from the burbs' to the streets
From the words in the verse to the base in the beats
Get a thick milkshake from a brawl like a lease
Chillin' with some mobsters where every word is capisce
If I get it off the the dock then I'm gettin' it for cheap
Cuz' them chump bad boys make it where you can't sleep


Every time I'm on it, grindin' and coastin'
Ride with my nigga, first question is you smokin'
Everybody like this, why did I write this
Predictin' the future like a motherfuckin' psychic
See me on top cuz' I got what you wanted
I don't pop pills but shorty like rollin'
So I keep pourin', shorty keep twerkin'
Cadillac on , really really do I heard it
If she get to flirtin' really don't phase me
Hoes come and go but money is my lady
Might have my baby  us at the business
Investin' in the hood to bring the world to Mississippi
Show em' how I'm livin', flippin' while I'm cruisin

Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me
Hey, I pull up to the club in a drop-top Jag
Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me
And they said I wouldn’t make it but I come right back
Everybody waiting on me, everybody waiting on me

Hey, yo, Krizzle got the next spot, it’ll prolly be the best spot
Hey niggas out here doubting me? Fuck ‘em, I’m a vet now
Smokin’ on some killa, gettin’ brain, playing Xbox
Relaxing that I’m countin’ cash, while you niggas is stressed out
Clean as a whistle, with the skills some would kill for
I came to get this money, what the fuck these niggas here for
Bubble gum rappers get no love where I come from
Hey you can up and disappear for a small lump sum
Fuck what they say about me, never say it to my face
Naw I ain’t no killa, but don’t push me to a murder case
Hey, I know niggas that’ll do a hit and never hesitate
They hit ya in your head, face, chest, and your vertebra


Hey, I’m right back to it like that nigga the shit

And for them niggas sitting comfy, you ain’t outta my range

I’m the best thing going since Chinchilla in the Winter
A&R’s gettin’ at me cause they say I’m the best
With deep mind, my grind, no doubt we got next
Oh yes, I got rep and they shit don’t flow
So if them bridges burning nigga, yea I got my boat
Know I got that yacht, where them hoes gon’ chew

And when I'm not with you I (don't know what to do)!

This Mary J, any time we can ball out
Hey, you around whenever my niggas crawl out
We take it cross state, on top secret missions
Hey, I can set you out, I know that she ain't trippin'
I start the morning with ya, I end the day with ya
Fuck what them haters say, I probably never quit ya
I know those fellas hit ya, I know you diggin' me
Cause when we all alone, only into me
And all my fantasies, you helped me see them clearly
And I can't concentrate shawdy when you ain't nowhere near me
They say you healthy for me, you got 1000 names
But in the years that I've come to know ya, you're Mary Jane
You put me on the level, I'm talking highest highs
I been to 10 and 11, I say fuck cloud 9
I never met your brothers, Reggie and Bobby Brown
Heard they can't stand me, so they can't come on this side of town


No matter where I go, I know that I can find you
And when I'm on my grind, I'm knowin' that you grind too
Hey, I'm a little selfish, I hate to pass you 'round
And when I pick you up, I find it hard to put you down
I keep it tucked away, for all them rainy days
Hey girl, I dig your aura, it's like a purple haze
You got me (spaced out)! And that'll never change
Your body light as air, I watch it float away
Most of my friends come around cause they wanna taste ya
I don't know why, but some suit and tie love to hate ya
But I just love to drape ya, into the finest dutches
And when I'm down, you like a playa crutches
And when I first saw ya, I knew you was a dime
Who woulda known on (?) that you would be all mine
I'm just a lucky a nigga, I'm really glad I found ya
It's safe to say that I don't know what I would do without ya

Tell a hatin' ass nigga ""Your bitch my bitch""

Press the pedal to the metal on I-285

Now theres only so much money I can stuff in my pants

A man is trapped, forever lost in this endless maze
And then they wonder why they kill each other
He out for mine I guess he ain't got shit so I can't trust my brothers
For some nigga they crime shit OK it gotta pay
Reality is it's sad to say, but there ain't no better way
And if a nigga got a problem what I do for mine
Tell 'em walk some miles in my shoe, then work a 9 to 5
That music shit running low eventhough I give my all
Authority ain't my best friend, at times I just wanna kill my boss
And I'd be lyin nigga if I said I ain't do no dirt
Try not to embarrass my folk because my family's first
And I ain't never the type to back down from no challenge
Then again I never took one more shit than I could handle
Some niggas was just born to win and some were born to lose
I felt like I was dealt a bad hand, but I paid my dues

It seems that I'm condemned to live a life of sin
Cuz I ball short
When will my troubles end and happiness begin?
Can you change my heart?
I swear I had enough, but I never gave up
Eventhough this world's so tough
I'm holdin onto me, a rapper with a dream
I hope you all feeling me

You said they say sometimes I lose hope
And like I'm a basketball star no prone I met my dope
Unlike them folks or them niggas when shit pop off quickly
I write my family no rain no snow they could come and get me
I've been down for the 3OBC since I can remember
?coke and put in on the block until it was time for dinner
? I was ?eat up? hunger ?
Tryin' not to get caught up on no shit be gone till November
Cuz in the Queen we don't play we known for the battle
See me surfing up to sip the player I sleep it's in Seattle
Eyes closed, I gotta stay up on my toe ?
Cuz niggas get pills to turn off their lives and just roll through
Blocka blocka thats all it takes to fall out
It'll be the main trench no soldier ever crawl out
For this game I try not to go all out
Your peace hit me so what I always seem to cold out


Third verse got me talking bout my situation
If I be watching for the birds I need an occupation
Give my cash up cuz I won't be this ? for long
Can't stay with mama bird I gotsa get on my own
Some niggas rely too much on gossip bout put mine in fame
Who's lucky the one that's in the casket that nigga that's at away
I have no need to front besides I'd rather stay to face
I get the deal and collect my dough before I fade to black
I see my brothers and I know, they would change, for the better
We adapt to their climate, that thunderstorm weather
And I know, I got hold my head up high to the sky
But my pride sometimes gettin away of the realness inside
I see the world upside down with no outs
Like a corner without themes, or the world without south
I'm gonna be dreamin' man cuz if I do decide to blow up
The jealous will go and grab their K, see me outside and roll up

In the end I'll be fucking up a lipstick
Aye this some pimp shit nigga I don't think or doubt it
You ain't a pimp nigga if you got to think about it
Better hand cup her bra when she around G's
Mad because his main lady went and chose me (chose me)
You confused if a bra will ever have a bro
Be like Snoop nowadays
We don't love them hoes (we don't love them hoes)
I would talk much much for the bitch though
I'm still on the try of thoughts you learn from the risks though
You know you fine or you wouldn't be in my car
Aye twerk a little something shorty you could be with a star


Aye twerk a little something shorty let me see what you got
Twerk a little something shorty let me see what you got
After the club we can chill at my spot
After the club we can chill at my spot

Aye toss it on a player baby I'm get her and
Shorty show me what she got and no she ain't scared of it
Aye toss it on a player baby I'm get her and
Shorty show me what she got and no she ain't scared of it

It's live live baby think it's hell
Caramel brown grab her ass whisper in her
It'll tell her turn around (turn around)",https://genius.com/Big-krit-twerk-a-lil-something-lyrics
They Gone Hate (Original),See Me On Top,2006,"Welcome the new kid, hello the new hustler
Ever since my birth, I've been the same hustler
I twist the streets up with every flow I split
Twist they mind-frame up, that's every ho I get

Hey I'm ride with the Chevy (?) wood grain grippin'
They gone hate though, they gone hate though
I got the purp and the yak, and my rims still spinnin'
They gone hate though, they gone hate though
I got my stacks on deck and the K gone blow
They gone hate though, they gone hate though
I'm 'bout the flyest nigga comin' out the slum with the flow
They gone hate though, they gone hate though

Welcome the new kid, hello the new hustler
Ever since my birth, I've been the same hustler
I'm from that 'sippi land, hell yea they know me
I'm from that Red-Line aka 3-0-B
That's where them G hang in the dirty-dirty
The folk can't clean it up so we call it dirty-thirty
I push to pacify these hoes cause they talk too much
I keep my business to my self cause niggas talk too much
They just hate to see a street nigga doing great
Feel like they obligated to snatch some cheese right off the plate
But I ain't trippin' though, just don't stick your hands in mine
If I'm the folk, then you the skater, I destroy your grind
Make it happen K, that's what they tellin' me
I'm like that 9-11, nobody expected me
And my clique too, the whole state of 'sippi
They relate to my swagger, so they ride with me


I twist the streets up with every flow I split
Twist they mind-frame up, that's every ho I get
Like them - yea, yea, I talk shit on the track
Niggas mad cause I won't let 'em get on the track
They ain't beefin' though, cause they ain't done for
Knowin' if they want the crown, I'm the one to come for
Yea, man, I'm gung-ho, if you gotta problem with it
I don't call problems cause I solve 'em, get it?
I'm the target of every rapper spittin' flow bitch
I'm the first pick to blow, dog, and they know this
Why it ain't hard to see, greatness is apart of me
Writing tracks and making beats, cause royalties belong to kings
And I want to see (?) off whatever I drop
And I wanna see mills dog, whenever I pop
And I'm one of these niggas now that I'm takin' the top
So, I'm tellin' these niggas now that they destined to flop


They know me from the hood that I ride in
White T, fitted cap, Louie on the side of my kicks
You can catch me in the hood with my folk boy
That consists of pimps, real niggas, and them dope boys
Be at the 'sip or A, I can keep it poppin' nigga
Krizzle on the track so the whole hood jockin' nigga
Hey I could tell by they eyes that they wanna (?)
I'm 18 but they know that I'm movin' shit
Pray they producer known in this music shit
Who else young as the K even doin' this?
Break bread with my niggas that ride
I got a state full of niggas and they ready to die
So, we can take it to the pistol place (?) shawty
Really ain't shit till the killer K shawty
I make it happen if I got around here
Cause niggas main focus - making dollars 'round here

My Life Ain’t Rosey,See Me On Top,2006,"Ok (yeah) let it roll do that (yeah)
Get some things off my chest do it with J.T
I ain't really had much support in this rap shit (nah)
Been doing it for about six years strong (six years)
Went from group to group to group (solo)
I'm solo man

My life ain't rosey but I roll with it (yeah)
Death comes real easy when it's hard living (it's hard living)
Dirty thirty born and bred it's where a nigga raised
Staying true to my ghetto trying to get paid
I love the girls but life was better until the bills came
They say they love you but they'll fuck you that's for real man
The minimum wage shit it never really lasts
The next resort is to pushing dro just to make some cash
They tell these niggas I was thrown in my past life
Tell them I strived for the cheese not that limelight
That fame shit is dangerous when it comes to flow
Niggas so focused I hear chasing at the rims and hoes
I never told to be this way nigga and that's for real
I'd rather stay true to myself and sign without a deal
I got to do it big 'cuz so we all can eat
How can I lose when all my siblings looking up at me
And all I pray is that tomorrow ain't like yesterday
My music's destined to live on once I pass away
I stay down in my town until they feeling me
Lack of support from my folk is truly killing me (fuck 'em then)
I tried lord but I cannot love my enemies
I'm surrounded and it feels like I cannot breath
But I can't let that worry me because I don't ask for help
I came here I been here I'll die by myself

For the streets, bring it back
For the hood, bring it back
For the beat, bring a stack
For the track, bring a stack

They ain't know that I can snap like this
Adidas 1's in the club got 'em thinking now
Get the fuck up out my way when I'm swanging out
I own the lane, nigga, and you ain't holdin' shit
I give you sidelines and that's all you get
You don't play no position in this rap game
You just gettin' towels, where's my water man
I rep the 'sip a lot and that dirty (?)
I got that focused flow, call it Tai-Chi
Or that hot shit, it's the same thang
The track's a telephone, I'mma let it rang
All the fuckboys, that used to doubt the K
Doubt the way I rhyme, doubt the beats I made
But I'm the one boy, I got that killa flow
And then they know, (worth a mil on the low)


Hey, these niggas sleepin' on the flow but I woke up
The industry was unfaithful, so it broke up
So I've been texting niggas for every track that come from me
Say you want a beat? Shit dawg, it ain't for free
Let's talk prices nigga, this ain't Wal-Mart
Let's status quo (?) lets see pie charts
We talkin' 1 stack, that's as low as I can go
You ask me what I think, (worth a mil on the low)
Yea, I came from the gutter, they say the K's a crisis
They ain't talkin' behavior when they say that he's the nicest
On the West he fire, up North he spit
He the truth in the A, in the 'sippi - the shit
Ask 'em 'bout me, they know the K is gonna blow
And it's the same thing, everywhere you go

I Ain’t Playin’ No Moe,See Me On Top,2006,"I'm talkin' 500 degrees straight out the coup
With some boppers in my ride and they head out the hood
In the hood I finally recognize the K and the truth
Before I die I promise I have my name on some shoes
No one sayin' what you usually get
I'm fresh off the dome, I ain't used to this shit
But the niggas out to fly like a bird since I've been on the curb
I only had one thing that's my balls and my word
Set a standard went to Atlanta with my crew
He my eyes and my ears but down here I proach
Down here I crush anyone in the face
What if their backs turn fuck it anyone replace
If I said it I meant what I did what I done
Kick ass (?) without using my guns
Without using my lungs, I still will make mils
I could die motherfucker, and I still will get deals

I ain't playin' with you niggas no more
That 44 get 'em make you hit the floor
And if you want it you can get it at the door
If it ain't about money stop talkin' to me hoes

Oh shit I did it again, ay hold up
Niggas got a problem with K, you best fold up
I ain't got time to play with no hoes
Unless they coming right off the track with my dough
A pimps ID's broke, I don't need it
Me not gettin' the deal, I can't see it
Fuck them niggas, I know they don't like me
And if they got a problem with Krizzle, they come fight me
Why a fuck nigga? they know they don't last
I don't care I conk ya are you don't pass
Queen city bomb, I'm known for that ?
My one goal, gettin' that dough, watch me (?)
I ain't got problem with these niggas
Stop motherfucking cock blockin' me, niggas
And let's make something clear
I ain't never quit once in my life I touchdown each year


And one more thing, I never need a clique to be hard
I'm six foot but something else make me lord
Creep bitch hard (?)
Just to see what I got what I got in my garage
No peakin', but this weekend I'm freakin'
Somethin' I can cut and nonchalantly leave it
Never been a type of trick, no bitch
But I get that bit, and I trick that bitch
Move over, KRIT got something to say
He was alive last week but he's dead today
I ain't got time to play with yo
Baby sit ya, fuck nigga, I'm sayin' to you
Don't be talkin' that pop trunk cause I go and pop trunk

Born and bread in the south
Throwback throwback, draw attention to some trims
I ain't never played ball, but I'm still above rims

 Georgia Peaches no less than a dime
I provide 'em with dreams all in one evening
Bad yellow bones, I fuck 'em and leave 'em

With some screens in my trunk and a handful of freaks

Mouth like she can suck a dick, get so wet she drip drop

Woofing like you bad, getting to big for them bridges
Got a big ball lil sissy here won't fight

Cop hammers in there lining everywhere that I go

Aye I'm back ho stay on my grind

Money's a river and can't no man up in my care flow
Keep my business composed and talk for a little though
Tell all them fams they having running with the task force
CD don't sell but it shelves if you don't grind
Haters so tarnished by all their snitching that they don't shine
Practice my pimping so when I'm pimping man it's going down
Either in mine or in your city or your nearest town
Shaking the block so much that these motherfuckers hear me now
Hear me from underneath so that mean that I'm still underground
Really don't bother me because they're still gonna represent a G
If I don't blow today I'll just get mine in the south scene


Aye I'm back ho stay on my rhymes

Spit out them rhymes and on top of that I make beats
Nigga the wrists I'll be the next artist to sign a deal
Put me some twenty fours on that lick it and cop a billion green
Showing my ass because when I smash niggas better gone
Why would I need a man the street's got my back 'cuh'
I got potential to have the mix tape of the century
If I don't blow today I just get mine on the south scene


Aye this ain't a game, motherfucker like you thought it was
Niggas don't compare to the K, they don't ball enough
Because all the animosity they pile it all
The game's like some pussy, nigga y'all getting swallowed up
Because they know I'll have your back all night hard
And It's gonna cost shit, your rap it's not bars
You couldn't blow if you had Hov on track, T.I., Nas, Young Jeezy
And the Holy Ghost on track, and if they did the hook, and Pharrell aced a beat
Every boss gangster crip'll pumped up a grave street
Y'all niggas must be tripping he going farther than these groups
Y'all niggas entertain but I really make music
I really can't do this I'm respected for mine
They don't care how much it cost they just want me to sign

He couldn't feel it in the air, he was Beanie Seagel
I showed up breakin' bread, takin' name, and givin' orders
Yea, I'm something like Troy, universal soldier
I made it in the street but, they heard it miles away
How he known in Atlanta? He live miles away
I'm that 'sippi shawty, no more cotton pickin'
Unless you talkin' white-tees and throwbacks I'm kickin'
We pop the tags and buying bars while our bumpers drag
They gettin' mad and jockin' hard cause those niggas fag
I'm 'bout my paper, you can keep the fuckin' fame dear
I'm touchin' down, I'm about to change the game here


That boy got flow, that boy gone grind
That boy gone blow, that boy gone shine
That boy got hustle, that boy got fire
That boy done struggle, that boy gone ride

Okay, when you see me, don't speak unless it's 'bout some cheddar
I ain't in the closet, but I got Barrettas
I know gorilla niggas, call 'em jungle fellas
They ridin' on propellers and open up like (?)
On them niggas that claim they gutter and own the spots
I'm Mr. Clean, I street sweep niggas off the block
I don't fare well with niggas talkin' down G
The K's a Buddhist in this game, I don't eat beef
I just kill bars and flood hoods with sick beats
And make niggas quit rappin' and get J-O-Bs
Because I'm hot with it and they not with it
I could sign after I die - blow and sell millions
I touch the hood with the swagger, sayin' flow's a miracle
They way I spit up on the track, some would say is spiritual
I got the Glock Four, I sell it all for profit
I got the South with me shawty, can't nobody stop it",https://genius.com/Big-krit-jackin-4-beats-lyrics
Putcha Sign In Da Air,See Me On Top,2006,"Aye, put your sign in the air, if you're repping for your city
Put your sign in the air, that's if you're down for your street
Put your sign in the air, then throw it all for your block
Put your sign in the air, if you're from the QC

Aye, it's for the streets where i'm from, they're where we just stayed these days we take over, and eat them rhymes, and them beats
I'm the king of the Queens when it sold this shit
Cold clique runs in with G's
I'm a fly playa, when a dry playa put some eager side playa, you was meant to die playa
We can collide right here in the block, creep up on me, and you'll be our victim, whose spin stop
Rather be at the bottom peeping off with the top, we the boss Mississippi filling it up in every drop
KRIT mix tape known to leave the city in shock, when it come out look how quickly haters flock
Red likely in this game, but I never will stop
Leave them leaning like the hands on the Jacob Watch
Could you see here busters representing a bad brother
Aye throw it up for cousins hitting licks in your city

I try to keep it cool, fuck it but I keep a tool
Trick jumping out of line, I'll show you how to act a fool
Monkey see, monkey do, he can bring his whole crew
Smash like the ass now, forty four to twenty two (twenty two)
Preachers hear the pinnacle, repping for my thug niggas
Pimps, thirty third boys, killers, then them drug dealers
Queens didn't know that, killers can't hold that
You claim that you're hard, let me see if you can owe that (show that)

I belong in the sky with the stars and the moon

If I can pitch it to ya, better believe I'm a goon
I'mma be a millionaire way before I'm in a tomb
I made a couple power plays, dropped a couple bombs
Now my screens hang down, ceiling like Saddam
My life just like a movie, and this would be the scene
When my father held me up and said my son gonna be a king
I'm woodgrain drippin', my paint still flippin'
My top got lost, but nah it ain't missin'
He ain't never seen it done like this
The grill, the chain, the charm, the wrists
The car, the clothes, the hoes, the whips
The black 24's with the chromed out lids
They hatin' on me baby, but yea it's all good
Tell all them trap stars that still in the hood

Instead, what you expect when you ain't have shit
And they ain't paying half of what you asking
Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
Now the hoes is down for taking pictures cause you're flashin'
You can't even imagine, maybe Kim Kardashian
Number one song, get a grammy, now I'm smashing
Maserati crashin', swerving through the traffic
Wrap it round a pole, sell a mil off the tragedy

Lord Just watch over mine
As I lay it down
Get to it one more time

Our Father I promise I'mma straighten up
When my family can say that they done ate enough
When my pockets is full and I ain't scrape enough
And these mother fucking laws ain't out chasing us
And my bills ain't due because I paid em up
And all that anger as a youngster I ain't savin up
AK'ed it up red line traded up (300)!
If you ask me these haters ain't hate enough



Our Father I promise I'mma shake em off
When that G5 Jet start taking off
And these hoes after shows I'mma wave em off
When I'm married but for now I'mma break em off

Krizzle, he a new breed, life's like a movie
All the newcomers like, who he? who me?
Just a nigga straight up out the gutter 
With the skill to make a New Yorker wanna be Southern
Streetlights tell the stories of the real niggas
Pardon me if half the time I don't feel niggas
Like honestly, how the fuck you get a deal nigga?
I guess once I get on, I'mma have to kill niggas
Lord I was tryin' not to push it to the ledge
The grind ain't sturdy and we hangin' on the edge
Mississippi got next, you heard what I said?
Now still I'd rap some of the best when I'm dead
Check my cred, killer is a fact
I'm talkin' 'bout bars, I ain't talkin' 'bout pecs
When I get green like Gumby, I stretch
A pair of J's out the case, yea I'm that fresh
Yes, give me any beat and I kill it like it's livin'
I only do me, cause fuck how they feelin'
That green that I'm tottin' got me higher than the ceilin'
The whip color Sunny-D nigga, I'm orange peelin'
Streetlight chillin', niggas can't touch me
Car without an engine, bitch you can't budge me
Heard the lames hate me and they baby mommas love me
If they didn't handcuff 'em at my show they'd prolly fuck me
I'm a little crazy, I'm a little off though

Toss you in the trunk and drive away with the cargo

Grill look mean on the whip it's a gargoyle
It's the shit niggas in the hood sell hard for
A fine crib and a Lambo Mercilago
A1 Credit and the next Top Model
But you know niggas
Think they guns can stop 4 niggas
Claim they hard as hell, but really ho niggas
Slow niggas never get paid
Gold diggers get played
And lame niggas never get laid
Unless they throwin' fetti at a chick that call me daddy
She bring me all the money cause she know that make me happy
Go out and break her back just to keep her nigga flashy
And see me on top, she thought it was a classic
I'm a nervous wreck on the mic, I keep spazzin'
Married to my money and she havin' contractions

Player’s Ball (Freestyle),The Last King,2009,"Hey, I'm live from the underground railroad
Won't fall in the same trap that these niggas fell for
Industry cats ball, but really they barely paid
Rather be broke and keep it real than be a slave
See, they got you live from the underground railroad
Won't fall in the same trap that these niggas fell for
Industry cats ball, but really they barely paid
Rather be broke and keep it real than be a slave

See, they got you caught up in this maze of money cars and bitches
Chains you never wear, clothes that barely fit you
Niggas is down with ya cause you got you some bread
You think Shawdy feel for you cause she gave you some head?
Now, she a best seller because she wrote about your secrets
How you ate her out and you claim you never eat it
Brung her breakfast in bed, claim you never feed her
Nothin' but bubblegum and dick, ain't that a bitch?
Now, your record ain't sellin', bill folk callin'
Really ain't free, you be damned if you walk in
So you drugged, sellin' again
Same game that took you out the hood put you right back in
But you floss and you stunt where the cameras at
Later on handin' all of that jewelry back
Frontin', cause you scared without that you ain't nothin'
But a human being strivin' for somethin'
Superheros don't exist, only on comic strips
Mind, brain, time fly, wonderin' where it went
Now you 808 heartbroken, going crazy
Confused about your life cause you ain't felt the same lately
As you did when you did it for the love
Recordin' in the closet, play it back for your cuz
Writtin' about the truth and the way that it is
To be a nigga from the minors on your way to the bigs
Tellin' all your family that you got 'em and they good
And when this advance hit your bank, you gonna get them out the hood
Buyin' fancy cars on the chrome with the candy
Red carpet treatment, take 'em all to the Grammys
Man, at least that's what the A&R said at the table
With the checks and the label execs
You always did your best and your family understand
The first few years you can't do half the shit that you planned
Damn, you never, ever home, the city think you wrong
Cause your family fucked up and you ridin' on chrome
Cribs got your house on blast, secret compartment
Your brother can't barely afford his one bedroom apartment
On the gutter side of town, niggas can barely eat
But still keep it real and go and purchase your CD
Upset because you ain't did you a mil in a week
Mad at your street team, cause they ain't deeper in the streets
Like all your hard-work paid off
You own your own company, never get laid off
Go party with the rich folk, they feel your pain
Just as lonely as you, wished they had never changed
The game we in
Hey, this the game we in

Now all the rappers came, from far and wide
Talkin' bout money cars and hoes, like that's all to life
Now, I'm here to tell ya, there's a better way

The calm before the storm, soft feet and itchy palms
Things we do for green make you wish you wasn't born

Don't pick it, let it fester

Prayin' for forgiveness for my sins
While some sell their soul for a Benz
It ends now, what makes me better than the rest
I guess it's cause I say so, like need I say more?
Why stop when they can't keep up?
The thrills and the kill it ain't shit to beat ya
Fuck you and your feature
The R&B singers on the choruses is why your song was a hit
Whack ass rappers suck a dick and die slow
I'm the only King Remembered In Time that you know
They never thought I'd grow up to be a beast on beats
Fix my plate, let's feast on MC's

Real niggas out here tryin' to make this money
If they won't hand it to me, I'mma take this money
Sometimes I hate this money
Hey, I'mma bully in the school of life
I went from no dough to polos and rockin' red ice
Rubies, Louie, I got that for my bitch
Bags, rags, tags, to ball and shit
I don't think these niggas hear me though
I'm on that put you on a cereal box shit
See men block shit
Hang you off a buildin' till you show me the spot shit
Whats the combination when they leavin' and when do they drop shit
Get money nigga, fuck what they talkin' 'bout
Last nigga comin' in, the only nigga walkin' out

He got one hit song and you gonna fuck homie
Only to find out it never last
That's when you comin' back, what you want was real cause you tired of rap
Yea, you tired of them
Cause I'm from the 'ssippi, you think I can't hold you down like Wayne & TIP?
Now come on
When they no longer believe, you find yourself runnin' back to me, baby
Hey, but I could do you one better
I could give you everything but you wanna settle
So come on
I ain't one of those skinny jean boys
You crushin' on the triple beam boys

Booth N da Sky,The Last King,2009,"Me, Big and Pac in a black 'lac
Pac got his scar tat, I got my hat back
Big riding shotgun with a Coogi on, looking for CD to roll a doobie on
Blunt hittin' hard, Jack Dempsey
Smoke up in the car, listening to Pimp C
After that, we hit the booth, the killer bee, the track was some J Dilla Heat
The hook went:

Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my music is alive, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my booth is in the sky, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga

In the abyss I resiz-ide, in the skizz-eye
I throw my Polo embroidered angel wings on and flizz-eye
And hit the nearest block party, to jam out with MJ, Pac and Bob Marley
Freestyle with Biggie and Pun, Big Year actin' a fool
Aaliyah ad-libbing to Screw on the 1s and 2s
And I mean everything was chill:
Willie was talking fly, and Marvin Gaye was on the grill
Pimp C sat me down and told me, ""Young'n, keep it trill.""
""It don't matter what they want, just always do what you feel,""
""If you've gotta press something, be the diamond on the wheel,""
""cause being scared to swang down just ain't no way to live
""cause even old schools show they grills""
Then he said, ""Hold up!""
Grabbed some wine, hollered out, ""UGK for life!"" raised his glass and told me, ""po' up""
My granddaddy tapped me on the shoulders
Then my grandma told me they was so proud I showed up with a booth in the sky

Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my music is alive, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my booth is in the sky, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga",https://genius.com/Big-krit-booth-n-da-sky-lyrics
Don’t Lose Count,The Last King,2009,"Hey what that is? That's enough to live life we wanna live
I can count, a couple cars, a few broads, and a crib
I can count, it's simple math homie, this ain't trig
I can count, that's enough for us to do it big
I can count, don't lose count
Don't lose count
Don't lose count
Don't lose count

Okay, all my homies ridin' clean, it's only right we do the same
Keep my eyes open, just in case they play that murder game
Shit I don't trip, collect my chips and get my ass on
Did without my childhood years, so I get my mash on
Rather sit back, count stacks, and fuck groupie hoes
Stop smokin' bud on occasion, we blowing stupid 'dro
Never been the type to trip, but today we go stupid though
He ain't grown up to be me, so you don't even know
Makin' hurricane to the point they can't see the flow
Used to have a lot to say, but haters they don't speak no more
Shut down the street kitchen, niggas they can't eat no more
Do this like 24/7, so we don't sleep no more


Okay, you get a mil today, my nigga that's a mil tomorrow
I'm your local hood bank, if you need mils to borrow
No credit, no debit, I can deal with it
If you can't pay, don't lie, keep it real with it
Everybody wanna be a king or a kingpin
You a king, I'm a king, fuck it we all kings then
Did to me, all about your cavalry, and your king's men
Some niggas that will die for your shit that you believe in
Money just a tool, nigga, to find more time
To get more money, to get money and then die
I said:
Money just a tool, to buy a nigga more time
To get more money, gonna blow it all and then die",https://genius.com/Big-krit-dont-lose-count-lyrics

Children of the World,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"Just in case you was wondering
I did make the beat

Yeah, cause we just (children of the world)
And they wonder why we bang
Cause police do the same, that's the only rival gang
I'm just sitting here, praying to my father
Tired of today, forever scared of tomorrow
Where's a scale I could borrow?
Cause living ain't cheap
I dropped out of school, pops, cause college ain't free
Plus college ain't me
Sitting in the class
Questions rushing in my brain but I'm too proud to ask
Take it all in stride, teacher talking physics
And I just want to be fly
What good is a degree when there's no jobs to apply?
And fast food won't do cause you overqualified
I'm feeling like hustling
Tired of the foodstamps and budgeting
Running in so much work, we school-bus it in
God and our wrist the only things we be trusting in
All else fails, I'm in a casket like fuck it then
Either get rich or die poor
Nigga fell short and got jammed, but he tried though
I'm pretty sure my first words were ""survival""
Looking for the answers to my problems in the Bible
Cause we just (children of the world)
Try and decode all the secrets
My conversations with God always seem leave him speechless
And even when I was at my worst like ""we got to make this work""
My girl found time to leave me
Too broke to give a fuck, though
My past relationships got me like ""What up, ho?""
I'm just bitter, I ain't asking what you fuck for
Thats disrespectful, I admit
I was just saying, if you wonder why I call you ""bitch""
Cause we just (children of the world)
Guess I look up to the pimps
I ain't saying it wasn't wrong, but they had the freshest fits
The cars and the broads and the kicks
Is something to strive for when you ain't never had shit
I'm feeling like what the fuck
They want my soul like my ancestors' ain't enough
If I can't trust my own government, who can I trust?
If I abuse myself daily, who can I love?
Shorty might have AIDS like who can I fuck?
Sure enough that'll be the day that the rubber bust or I have a kid
Deprived of all the things that my father did
Cause the momma was a groupie and I was on some rapper shit
They gave me Hell like I asked for it
Signing everything under the sun but they ain't after K.R.I.T
I guess I didn't swag enough
Stupid fruity pebble chain, Louis bag enough
Popping tags, model bitches, couldn't brag enough
Bubba Kushy stupid loud pack, jet lag enough
Steady acting like I ain't had enough
Ten chains on your neck like you ain't flash enough
I wreck so many times, I guess I ain't crash enough
On the track like a pusher of crack, bag it up
I tell these niggas to back it up
My bitch like scarves, gave the Louis rag to her
'Sace shades on my eyes like I ain't seeing the hate
Too fresh to death, I couldn't attend the wake
That's too lyrical, he been round busting
Mississippi where? He don't sound Southern
He be down cousin it's since '05, I swear
The game's a pound of Reggie
So anything I sell's a breath of fresh air
Yeah, fuck with me",https://genius.com/Big-krit-children-of-the-world-lyrics
As Small As A Giant,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"See, I was made in my father's image and they belittle my deeds
Their lust for convictions pledge allegiance to the almighty power and greed
See seeds born, withered parents, still children, adolescent in their ways
Some preachers false prophets educated pigeon droppers using our sins to get paid
Slaves; give them freedom but give them dope
Take away their leader, 'cause that give them hope
Sell them dreams of changing things like they were never kings and queens before
As small as a giant

As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

The beginning was kinda dark, not too soft fairly hard
Drenched with love from my mother, connected to her struggle
Till she cut me loose, now what shall I do?
It was oh-so-easy, look at how they treat me
Ever since she pushed me through
Now put me back in and stop these contractions
Water breaking, aw damn I know it's bout to happen
Failed to fix, no picket fence, a dream deferred
Beer and liquor chillin' with my niggas swishas and herb
Eviction notices, hopelessness thrown on my shoulders
God won't give you more than you can handle
Carry these boulders, give it all I got until I get older
Couple medals on my sleeves cause life made me a soldier
Reminisce on how it was way back when
But some things were better off way back then
As small as a giant, a promise so divided
Probably ain't surprised in so long
Since we sung such over Lord's camp fires
Cosby's was cool but television is a lie
Some reason I relate to survivor
Fresh Prince but no Uncle Phil
The Carltons that I knew never stayed where we lived
Couldn't play with those kids
When they were reading books
We were playing cops and crooks
When they was writing essays, I was writing hooks
Mama I'll be that nigga on TV
'Cause people like Bow Wow and Soulja Boy make it look easy
No Pun intended, hoping they get offended
I'm throwing up if these niggas spittin'
Didn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings
Knight in shinning armor for this rap shit, I slash quick
Far as a man spit leaving gashes on these industry bastards
They can't see what is real, don't know how I feel
They weren't raised where I live
In Mississippi

As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

Rise and shine, no time for sleep, thinking bout eating
Leaving this place long gone
I get no service on this earth I need to phone home
Did too much dirt to talk to God, nowadays I get the dial tone
Try again tomorrow, my heart filled with sorrow
My family broke too so why bother try trying to borrow
No car, no house, drug dealing
Feeling like it might be my only option to get millions
What else could I do? Put yourself in my shoes
If you had no whip you'd take some shortcuts too
Their ain't no time to be wasted, the world is going under
Nowadays can't tell fall from spring and winter from summer
I wonder if this was meant to be
Maybe all the bullshit was meant for me, takes a lot of energy
Break these chains and erase these thangs
Society put up on our brain
How could I explain it, we ain't free yet
Obama cool but he ain't sending me no free checks
They killing all my niggas Lord forbid I'll be next
No now, got too many sorrows to say and
Kisses to give, they don't feel how I feel
They weren't raised where I live
In Mississippi

As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'ma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose

Lord I ain't cha best son
I ain't been to church in a while
But on that liquor I confess some
I missed a couple blessings wasn't ready
I was counting money
But I swear I'll catch the next one
I did some dirt to be the fresh one
I lost some friends over ends but I guess that's what I get, huh?
Chasing dreams that I can barely see
Shooting for the stars, when that's something I could never be
Maybe all the flash wasn't meant for me
Maybe I'm too real for this industry
I sit alone in this four-cornered room
Writing about life and how it goes to soon
Pimpin these broads fast cars and jewels
All in the blink of a eye I could lose
It's all good, love and pain
Somethangs I just can't change
I just can't change

I can't keep worrying bout the things in my life I can't change
Dear Lord give me the strength to fight the evil in this game
Ooh I close my eyes and get down on my knees
Pray to the heavens protect my family
If I leave, that's good enough for me

My girl think I'm no good
And she should
I ain't done much to make her think different
Late night checkin' chicks really wasn't effortless
I'm erasing messages so she ain't caught me slippin'
I never really knew how much I loved her till she dipped and
Decided she ain't scared of lions, tigers, and bears
But she scared to be in love with me
Out of fear that I'll sleep with every broad on the road I see
Probably so-do I ride solo
On the mission for some mo doe
Ball hard to ease my mind
Tried to call her and she picked up
Said she really can't talk it ain't over but she need some time nah I'm a limbo
It ain't simple yeah I feel her
Says she got a friend an word is she really dig him
I'm dealing with the pain I lost her and I know it
I'm praying for the strength not to show it
Seems hopeless

I can't keep worrying bout the things in my life I can't change
Dear Lord give me the strength to fight the evil in this game
Ooh I close my eyes and get down on my knees
Pray to the heavens protect my family
If I leave, that's good enough for me

I was just waiting on this moment in my grandmama kitchen
An artist from Mississippi like who would care to listen
I'm southernize countryfied no doubt
I hustle hard my slang raw, so what now
Get it in by any means I said
Having dreams of a such things I bled
Sweat and tears, potent dro and beers
Liquor helps me think but I pay the toll in years
Women galore, some where whores
They never fill the void
All I wanted was more
The company up under me was shady
Childhood friends turned enemies they hating
A lot of folk done made it to hell I know they waiting
For me to fall off and burn if I'm forsaken
We workers of inequity, Lord we knew better
It's hard to be broke and do better
Father forgive me

I can't keep worrying bout the things in my life I can't change
Dear Lord give me the strength to fight the evil in this game
Ooh I close my eyes and get down on my knees
Pray to the heavens protect my family
If I leave, that's good enough for me",https://genius.com/Big-krit-good-enough-lyrics
Moon & Stars,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
As I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

Yeah, yo, my digital dash, as I mash on the gas
Don't know where I'm going fast, but I'm going there
Stop at the club, forever sure there's some hoes in there
Shaking they ass, looking for players with dough to share, but that ain't me though
Before I trick on a bust-it baby, I'm outta the do'
If you are looking for saving shawty, I'm not your hero
More like a guide
I can take you where you want, would you look in my eye?
Like you supposed to, cold enough to froze ya
Talking bout that pimping you already been exposed to
Far from being sober, let's travel into space while
Puffing on this Yoda, glowing like a lightsaber
Doing what the grownups do
Be grateful that this game was bestowed upon to you
Cause backstabbing betrayers divide, don't listen to
Cause they front, but they don't, do what I do
Cause they will never ever be pimps

So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
As I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

Under the moon and stars I cruise in my car with you in my arms
I'm feeling good with my brews and cigars
As the sun dips down, we skip town
A nice rendezvous, I'm quite fond of you
And you're feeling me too, I mean literally
You're rubbing the nuts, you tickle the D
Let me drop the top while we puff on trees
Let the breeze blow through your weave
As you bob your head to the beat
Come on girl, take them heels off your feet
Vibe this sweet right quick
You take a hit and relax
I know you had a long day, I'mma turn up the music
And you can put the phone away and we can... just chill
Come over here and grip this wood wheel

So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
As I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars

Now usually I don't boast or brag
But, 'till they different I was crush brewed but don't need pros and I was with it
Get it, get it, get it
Girl if I hit it I'm gonna stretch that pussy out until you can drive a truck up in it
I'm kiddin', maybe not, I'm on it like fo's in vogues
Playas with alligators and capes like matadors
Struttin' like kings up on the scene and scatter rose
Peddles up under a work of art like sour dough
Dial it, my swag melodic
Like a sandy beach, couple freaks in the cottage
Fig fruits and groups rubbed oil up on my body
Worked hard to swipe her card, the type of broad to take me shoppin'
Because my ego big enough to get up out it
Plug a socket, fix a drape and paint her walls redecorated
What a dime, excavated, dig deeper and deeper in all the right places

So I ride, I lean, I crawl
Do it better than them all
Let the road be my guide
As I glide in candy cars
Underneath the moon and the stars",https://genius.com/Big-krit-moon-and-stars-lyrics
They Got Us,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"My nigga holla bang bang as the coppers pass
Cause just the other day they tried to rob the stash
Jammed up his cuz now he called from the pen
They got him praying for his bail so they won't take his kids
Cause his baby momma act out, she'd done backed out
Sold everything in the house cause she cracked out
He turned to me so much pain in his eyes
Like he ain't know being black and po came with a price
He took a toke as if it eased his mind
His nose running heavy cause he geeking lines
Clientele pulled up in a beamer truck
Served the driver and he said to me ""they got us all fucked up""

When this storm gon' settle?
I can't hurt forever
How can I do better now?
They got us all fucked up
Break my back for nothing (for nothing)
Lock me up for struggling
Only god can judge me, now
They got us all fucked up

I need a nasty freak to shake that ass for me
She said whats happenin' whats up yeah this ass ain't free
I got a friend if you want her, wait I could phone her
Everything half price cause Christmas around the corner
Since the recession its been hard if you strippin'
Cause niggas pay to get in but niggas ain't tippin'
Short on rent landlord trippin
Tired of eating noodles that taste like chicken
Don't really like hoin', ain't hard to tell
But when all else fail pussy always sell
Song stop spinnin' and the time was up
Snatch the money off the floor and said
They got us all fucked up

When this storm gon' settle?
I can't hurt forever
How can I do better now?
They got us all fucked up
Break my back for nothing (for nothing)
Lock me up for struggling
Only god can judge me, now
They got us all fucked up

I had a partner called pimpin
Had hella women say he raw dog chicks and never ever went to clinic
Now he thinks something wrong and he scared to check
He got a girl that he claimed never cared for sex
So he slept on her, crept on her, sometimes he even
Pushed her down and he stepped on her
One of his cutty buddys called him in and it got him freaked
Say she had a checkup and she got HIV
Claim is all his fault screamin raised her hands
Cause she got two kids and what about her man
He thought about his girl hopped out his truck
Called her phone and said as low as he could
""I got us all fucked up""

When this storm gon' settle?
I can't hurt forever
How can I do better now?
They got us all fucked up
Break my back for nothing (for nothing)
Lock me up for struggling
Only god can judge me, now
They got us all fucked up",https://genius.com/Big-krit-they-got-us-lyrics
2000 & Beyond,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"Right now we'd like to bring on a young make who believes in doing things his own way. Based on the way he (?) all the folks who've seen him work, his way has gotta be pretty hip. So lets make some noise

In 2000 and beyond
In 2000 and beyond
In 2000 and beyond

Tricks and hoes, bitches and stripper poles
Shake it for dollar signs, let me see from behind
The ghetto's a fairytale, pimps and Jazzabells
Dealers with chrome rims with products for you to sell
Chemistry in the kitchen, alleys with rubber in it
Tires go round and round, windows heavy tinted
Kush is scented inside, pull me over
Now they talkin bout a K9 (Code 6), black man face down
Charge it to game, bums warm their weary souls over open flames
Junkie can't find God watch him find his vein
Preacher walk by like he ain't seen a thang
Pass the collection plate
Niggas thought shit was gonna change on election day
Healthcare H1N1 nasal spray
Got me scared to hit the block
Wear my flag as a mask, tote a Glock, in 2000 and beyond

In 2000 and beyond
In 2000 and beyond

Poor folk scrape dollars and spend the last of their income tax
On impalas with the S-S, church gives awards to the best dress
Pastor drive a Bentley, got me thinkin, I was the less blessed
Cause I let a middle man, he was cappin' with em askin'
I dont understand, how you fit that many rings on a helping hand
Tired of deception, but I pay his kid's tuition cause I'm tryna get to heaven
Ain't it crazy, scared to have a baby
How can I protect it from the same streets that made me?
Concrete gladiator blood shed overflowin
In real life some places Russell Crowe will never go
Pimp tight flossin, look at what it cost me
Peace of mind no sleep late night tossin and turnin
Waitin' on the end, pray to God forgive me for my sins, in 2000 and beyond

In 2000 and beyond

As a child I was cold with a chip on my shoulder
Grandma told me be careful cause ther're sharks in the water
They will kill you, let the good lord steer you
Don't worry bout the government
Cause baby they dont feel you
Martin Luther King had dream, we was right there
I wonder what he saw when up and had nightmares
Quite scared, all the work he had done
Couldn't stop what we've become, in 2000 and beyond

Neva Go Back,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"I wish I was a kid again
Runnin' with my friends an' them, up n down the streets
Waitin' on a bell to ring
Ridin' on a school bus, drawin' on the seats
On the phone all night with a girl I like and she claim she a freak
It's straight, I could never go back
I would never go back, but it would be coo' to see

Rise n Shine
Get up off my ass and mash fo cash
No time to procrastinate
Yeah I'd ratha' drink a 40, but that'll have to wait
I ride a bucket, kinda rusty, but I'll blast the bass
On the road again
For the pros within
The block used to be sunny but they snowed it in
Now tha junkies scrape change for tha dollar menu
That's what he said, but tha rock is what he really into
Gave him a dollar anyway, cause who knows?
Maybe tha﻿ dope boy baby need some new clothes
Cause we all goin' thru it
No matter how you view it
Slice it, cut it, bring it back and screw it!
Hot as I've ever been, but I'm coolin' - out
AC neva works, so my windows - down
Not worried, kids scurry Saturdays
Reminiscing, Good Lord, how I used to run and play
Sometimes...

I wish I was a kid again
Runnin' with my friends an' them, up n down the streets

Ridin' on a school bus, drawin' on the seats
On the phone all night with a girl I like and she claim she a freak
It's straight, I could never go back
I would never go back, but it would be coo' to see

Grandma Linnie on the go
Cookin' in the kitchen, somethin' good for my soul
G-I Joes all on her living room flo'
It seems like yesterday, but she passed so long ago, Good Heavens
I want to go to church, but ain't no good reverends
She prolly frownin' on me now, because I know betta
But I push on, searchin' for some cush-on
To pay the bills and responsibilities that I disown
Not a pot to piss in, a tree to piss on
The devil come around to much, I'm hollin' get gone
But its hard to get off, when you can't get on
I pour my life on this wax, nobody lis-ons
So I cruise, me and just my blues
Lookin' at the world through my broken rear view
Not worried, cuz I pray for betta days
Reminiscing, Good Lord, how I used to run and play
Sometimes...

It's straight, I could never go back
I would never go back, but it would be coo' to see

Miss Linney, outside in her garden
My brotha, his son, and his daughta
The rap game, before I was spitting
Back when Pac and Biggie were livin'
Oooooooh, It'd be coo' to go back
But now where we're at
No, no regress.. I'm waitin on what's next

I wish I was a kid again
Runnin' with my friends an' them, up n down the streets
Waitin' on a bell to ring

It's the return of 4eva ho
I'm talking once upon a time in the south

It's the young K-R I-T
Mackin' hoes like niggas with perms and gold teeth
Candy paint, Caddie doors, high feel
Gator toe fetish with diamonds against the wheel
Like a pimp, never slack, never fold
Shake 'em up, break 'em, and slam 'em like dominoes
On the floor, vamonos, playa made
Replenishing these bitches with pimpin' like Gatorade
Tailor-made, super tight, Mr. B
Lookin' for a diva a to wide receiver a D
Touch down, outta sight, let it go
Comin' out hard

Well, it's Big Sant bitch and I'm a mob type figure
Comin' down on you hoes and you pussy ass niggas
Forever international, sipping sake with my Asian gal
My address is the winner's circle, you can hate me now
Hotter than my leather in the summer with the windows up
The word legend never get said 'less you mention us
My speech is mink, I want it all plus the kitchen sink
The whip white, time right, money green, pussy pink

Baby cho's on my hoes, hoes polished just to shine
Add the blue blockers and gators and even Stevie could see
So look at me, motherfucker, look at me

Man I'm coming out harder than you could ever imagine
Paper stackin', breaking mics, livin' the fastest
I keep dimes on deck like a bank teller
Pimpin' so strong ain't shit that I can't tell her
You ain't even on my radar ho, I can't smell ya
Can't see ya, don't know ya, partna, so you ain't special
See we alumni, nigga, next level
See me on top of the food chain, no pressure

Now hold up, hold on, get with it bitch
Throw money like hot potatoes, can't wait to get rid of this
Emphasizing my emphasis, don't sleep on my lyricism
Glow like the moon and stars, shine like a billion prisms
See the vision clear as day, Randy Savage with my mouthpiece
Life coach, quite hard, lost hope, outreach
Plenty done it but none can measure to the bass and the treble
Of a mother fucking rebel

Pimp tight world wide

Toot it up triple boot it up, pop 'n lock it there
Drop it there, rock it there, I'm a motivator
Haters best keep walking if it ain't about paper

Voices,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010," x3
I got these voices in my ear, yea I got these voices in my ear

Wake up to the sound of a million horns
Jesus piece, ruby red, diamond in the thorns
Say a prayer for the jammed and the one that's gone
I might've missed my nigga wake but still I mourn
Did it big in the club with my cash out
But dealing with a lot so I drunk until I passed out
Went abroad, I met a broad with her ass out
Her concern was to earn like ""nigga, what your cash 'bout?""
In the VIP on my tip with a glass out
We live a paparazzi life, what's your flash 'bout?
In a mattress in the ceiling, what's your stash 'bout?
In case I had doubts

I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get up, get up, get up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me wake up, wake up, wake up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me keep runnin', keep runnin', keep runnin'
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get money, get money, get money
Breathe

What if a dream was all you had?
And life ain't fab, you can't throw it in the bag
Niggas ain't real, hoes ain't shit
My hand-me-downs was too big, they buying clothes that don't fit
I'm like, it was more than fame and the credit
Feeling like my whole life I've been trying to be the freshest
Respected, in a world full of kings
You pathetic, if you can't buy the finer things, before you exit
The very moment that you got it: ""I swear my biggest fear is that I'll die nobody""
Forgotten, when I was really at my best
Seems like nothing left

I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get up, get up, get up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me wake up, wake up, wake up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me keep runnin', keep runnin', keep runnin'
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get money, get money, get money
Breathe

Lately I've been feeling like fuck it
Heaven's in my face, but Lord knows I can't touch it
Plus I heard the angel wings was kinda heavy
Scared to put 'em on my back so I threw 'em on a Chevy
Death knocking on my door, I can get it
Looking through the peephole in case I ain't ready
Fuck this rap shit, yeah I said it
On the road to the riches ain't no telling where I'm heading
Now I dread it, world ain't what it seems
Enduring all the shit to be king
Praying for tomorrow, there's more time to borrow
Scared, aware, they whisper ""never fear""

I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get up, get up, get up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me wake up, wake up, wake up
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me keep runnin', keep runnin', keep runnin'
I got these voices in my ear
They tell me get money, get money, get money
Breathe

Man 1 - My life today? Hmm... more volatile than ever. This last year alone I've been shot down, bloodied, trampled, accused, threatened, disgraced, betrayed, scandalized, maligned, tough? You bet your ass it is, but I ain't leaving, nothing comes easy
Man 2 - The last question - is it truly worth it?
Man 1 - Sure, you know why? I love what I do, I pray for people and when you think of most of your work in life, most of people's lives are spent on endeavors. And very few people really enjoy what they do and I love what I do, so yeah, it's worth it, damn right it's worth it",https://genius.com/Big-krit-voices-lyrics

Representin' that Mississippi shit man I swear they don't give me a shot cause of that shit
Nigga I'm country-er than a muthafucker but my lyrical content is crazy I'm making my own beats What the fuck?

They like Krizzle what'chu gonna be if ballin' all they wanna see
The cars, the clothes, the hoes, the Chevy door that fall like angel wings
(All of that been done before) well I'm a keep it simple
With my voice upon a track up till it come back monumental
Fuck a hater (I was greater) nominated since a youngin'
Out the womb I was groomed to be the ruler over something
It was nothing to be better (yeah) always on they level
They was hating, they was scared cuz they reign ain't forever
They been hearing bout me lately, wondering what I'm doing
They McNabbing I’ve been Vicking for the spot I’ve been pursuing
Ain't no losing where I'm coming from (ain't no going back)
Ain't no looking down (only looking round) where they at?
Where they going when I get here I can figure out
If you ain't a bank teller nigga what'cha talking bout?

Telling it for years they been boring us ignoring us
My climb to the top will be glorious

Now I ain't got no animosity to these niggas coming out, nah' mean? At the end of the day I wanna see a nigga get money
But'chu can't tell me Mississippi had a run
Not like Texas, not like Florida, not like Memphis, not like Louisiana, not like Atlanta
Hey Alabama did they thang, c'mon shawty
It all boils down to we got something to say you feel me

They like Krizzle what'chu gonna say when all the cameras in your face
About the 'Sip and David Banner and what it means to take his place
(Take a stand) do all that I can and take it off the block
Misinterpret what it say (now they think I'm taking shots)
On the low gave a nigga hope, that's just what it is
I don't need a nigga vouching for me, that's just how I feel
Never had (never ever been) and I never will
Mississippi never had a run (let's just keep it real)
Not like all these other states, Texas had em swangin' down
Rich Boy threw some D's on it, Alabama certified
Florida been outta there (Louisiana keep it trill)
Lil Wayne do his thang (Boosie Boy crazy where I live)
Memphis-Ten, Yo Gotti, Three 6, Ball and MJ
Atlanta still the Mecca artists blowing out'cha everyday

Tell em that for years they avoided us ignoring us my story will be glorious

I Gotta Stay,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"I told her you should go home
It's better that way
I wish I could come with you
But I got to stay, but I got to stay

All aboard I heard them call your name
I knew you got your ticket now you're on your way
And it was hard to watch you wave goodbye
I write you here and there with no need to reply
It's just I lost a good friend in a time of need
Like forever would be better but this time your free
Hate you left us kind of selfish just to think that way
You going home don't worry what you probably would say
But yeah it hurts I smile at the thought of
You At peace in your mind, no longer ache in your heart
Finish and start, rise with the sun
Finally hear your father say servant well done
I strive to be half of what you was
I'm just hoping that I can carry on your love
And I regret all the times I had to leave you
I promise I'mma see you when I see you

I told her you should go home
It's better that way
I wish I could come with you
But I got to stay, but I got to stay

Your motherly hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Played the tambourine so well
Reminiscing on my granddaddy, shed tears as you looked at his pictures on the shelf
Phone ringing everyday, friends gone away
Wishing you could go, but you had to stay
I sit and cried with you
Soon the fellings of the past aware, one day that you pack your bags
Turn to me and ask don't fret when I leave
This earthly body of mine done did all of its deeds
Crawled till it walked and held all it could breathe
Carry on what I taught you was given thru he
To you from me, in times like this believe
I got a call like you used to get just the other day, they told me you'd gone home to stay

I told her you should go home
It's better that way
I wish I could come with you
But I got to stay, but I got to stay

Now I know what you meant when you used to say
If I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away, I'd fly away
Lord, if I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away,I'd fly away

I told her you should go home
It's better that way
I wish I could come with you
But I got to stay, but I got to stay",https://genius.com/Big-krit-i-gotta-stay-lyrics

Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun

Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun

First off, I'm the country of the countriest
Mississippi bitch, what you know about that country shit?
Hold on, prolong I'm doing what you thanking
Naw it ain't the chittlings that got this shit here stanking
Jumping, bumping through the speakers, sub boomin'
Shawty I been stroking is what I been doing
Everybody got something to say about how we get down when we get down
Cause it 38's on the crown vic
So I use the ladder to get down with
They think its for the pickens is what im found with
Her face uhh ass outstanding
She micro braided I pull it and pound it
That malt liqour keep a nigga grounded
On the porch with my kin folk lounging
Up underneath the stars
They talk about my state but they know jus who we are

They know just who we are
Roll in oldie cars
Polo down country bound
Tight like mason jars

Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun
Boy you got boy you got boy you got gumpshun

Psychedelically excelling on daytons and vogues
Debonaireness majestic I'm killing these hoes
Sprinkle game of the greenest the meanest of flows
Plant a seed in your mental and leave in to grow
Eager to know how to get money and bring it to daddy
Evenly so buy me some gators and pull up the caddy
Open my door, chauffeur my car 'round and clean up my palace
Throw on my robe, run my bathe water and fill up my chalice
Sit on my balance beam until her belly cream
If that pussy needs ramming I'm bantering
Player made tailor made
Always in the gator state
92 bulls on a fool thats how players play
For the win like MJ straight away
Shook em off no time left fuck it fade away
Buzzer its all over with
Champagne lobster and shrimp

They know just who we are
Roll in oldie cars
Polo down country bound
Tight like mason jars

Ah playa play on
I roller skate on
I was taught to give them something just to hate on
Like a ford engine light I jus stay on
To find a yella belly I can take home
Or lay on, cause it ain't nothing bout a skill to
You either get her done barbecue or meal due
Let the superfly inside you steer you
Because being lame is a disease and can kill you
So let me put you on these hoes
Chevy that be heavy and the wall that be vogue
Peanut butter guts with the grape jelly globe
Chromed out bumper with the Cobain doors
That's suicide shit if you didn't know that
Need a lil pimping baby girl let me pour that
Sow that up with some dough on it
I was born with the gift of gab so motherfucker throw a bow on it

They know just who we are
Roll in oldie cars
Polo down country bound
Tight like mason jars

See Me On Top,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killin' 'em, money at my ceiling
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I get a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top! (see me on top)

All I want is money, All I see is paper
I don't owe you shit! Motherfuck a favor
Motherfuck a hater, prayin' to my maker
Tomorrow ain't promised, I might just see Him later
I might just get my cake up and never have to rap
I might just sell a million and never hit the trap
House full of plaques, walls full of racks
I might just get a bad bitch, and never come back!
Like, how he done that?! Fly above the struggle
Past in my trunk, future in my duffel
Emerged from the rubble
The cracks in the street
If I had a chance, but 'if' is all I need

When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killin' 'em, money at my ceiling
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I get a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top! (see me on top)

All I want is peace! What the fuck is pain?!
You can work for bull shit, I can't do the same
I'm deep in the game
Shit'll drive you crazy, signed once or twice
Now look at how the played me, bet you think they paid me
Bet you think I blew it all
Mad cause I'm from Mississippi, 
scared cause I do it all
""Whatcha mean you do it all?""
Yeah, I really do it all!
Produce and mix my own shit, outrap all of y'all!
Labels scared to take a fall
They ain't really signin' checks
Check this for the nonbelievers, askin' why I ain't signed yet Askin' why I ain't dying yet
Like what I'm supposed to do?!
I'm Big K.R.I.T., bitch! So who the fuck is you?!

When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian

Exhibit K (Freestyle),K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"Jealousy's a motherfucker
You weak jealous motherfuckers
If you a jealous motherfucker you just a weak motherfucker, ha
KRIT wuz here
Sorry we took so long
I wish I had a real excuse
But you motherfuckers just gotta be patient
Krizzle

Do you mind if I murder this?
Spit that southern slang over something so conservative
Swinging lane to lane, candy coated sippin' purple shit
Mind frame; I herbal it, southern MC of my caliber never heard of it
Verbally, spit that gospel proper in word of it
No obstacle can topple my run, simply hurdle it
Down to send shells over green this ain't turtle shit
Bolt like Usain not got game to get got
I mastered the Shaolin styles of BIG and 2Pac
Sweet and sour chicken while my partner working two woks
Trying to get that candy paint that's wetter than a dew drop
Down to take a loss like give me whatever you got
Scraping from the game, I'll be a king, just you watch
Sippin' fine wine with breadsticks and goulash
I'm far far away from sardines and noodles
You'd ball hard too if all your life you lived frugal
Wishing on a star for J's but got Pumas
That was passed down to you cause your brother outgrew 'em
I'm a get 'em, I'm a get 'em
Either ride for the cause or stay in and die with 'em
I figured you convert for what it's worth, I'm on my grind
If you ain't living for the day it's safe to say you wasting time
If you ain't down to elevate your mind, then bitch you wasting rhymes
Tarnished teachings never reach the pinnacle to shine
Discovery of Krizzle like the invention of flying
Intertwined with the holy grail and unearthing of Zion
You cartoon Simbas ain't fucking with this line
Ice box hard with a vessel made of iron
Thanks to the all spark I'm Optimus Prime
With the skill to battle rap death in the event that I'm dying
Do away with any doubts that might have kept you from buying
My product's so awaited like Doomsday to the Mayans
I'm fire, I'm back you ain't know who you was trying
I'm fire, I'm back you ain't know who you was trying
See KRIT ain't just a name it's an acronym
King Remembered in Time but none come after him
Hanging from the scaffold and reaching to the youth
About life and how to capture it
The shit I spit is baffling, off the chain but accurate
Forever real, freshly sealed, every time I package it
Switching up the flow so I could spazz a bit
You know you ain't fucking with me shawty kill the track and give it back
Cuz If I break it then I bought it, 
Mississippi to the core
Muddy water, Dixie rebel, cotton picking
I was doing if you talking Polo sweaters
Granny on the porch while she showing me the ropes
Never be ashamed of what you from and what you know
Cause no dues have been paid and for years they watch the flow
So look dead in the eyes when you talk to white folks
A product of environment is probably why I never win
My grandma passed and obviously I ain't been the same since
This ain't rap this experience
Birth of hip hop's very innocent
Light a candle something so intimate
God said keep going I was meant for this
Don't let the sound fool you my flow is too limitless
Boobie Miles on my journey
I'm killing motherfuckers all the while I'm still learning
Ancient secrets form my technique, a truth seeker alike
I gave a fuck if you respect me, I hail where the best be
No words for my enemies, yeah I pray for 'em but I rarely have the energy
Dodging weapons of man till God find a sin for me
My poetry more music than a singer with a symphony
It only makes sense they'd overlook me in this industry
But I heard they got wind of me

I Heard It All,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here,2010,"I done heard it all before
Yea you jamming, but yo image need some guidance
And some diamonds cause it's more to this than rhyming
Yea I done heard it all before
We'll be travelling and flying state to state
Fucking hoes, rocking shows if you sign
Ay I done heard it all before
Ay in this game, what you claim ain't the thang
Mississippi ain't for fame, change yo name
Yea I done heard it all before
But yo talent is by far a blessing
And a gift from God but we can turn you into a star
Ay I done heard it all before

Never losing in pursuing in my vision
In my kitchen writing rhymes, pray to God that they listen
But it's a real fucked up position that this rap shit might just put you in
My partner fed up with the game, like he might sell that kush again
Cause CDs we been pushing them, but deals ain't coming fast enough
We he need to go feed his kids and this shit here ain't adding up
Passing us by, time, never waste, busy home
Sit beside by grandma, wish that I can stay
The phone ringing, promises so confident of money plays
I head back to the struggle like ""they might sign me any day""
Forever trapped, no coming back, addiction's truly hard to break
A thousand pills could never fill the gap of leaving off the stage


I pride myself on being righteous, do it big and do it better
But A&R's ain't in the streets, I'm forced to follow them on Twitter
I'm painting pictures, ghetto compositions, living work of art
But dancing in a circle dressed as Urkel how you make your mark
Ay get yo star, play yo part, find yo swag, get yo deal
So you snapping, who needs rapping when you got some ad-libs?
And some days there's no choice, most days it's hard times
If skinny jeans mean big dreams, no thanks I'm just fine
In my mind, it's 'bout rhyme, I'm just tryna speak freely
My shawty feel illuminati's real and they might kill me
For voicing my opinion, scared to die but this ain't living
In these meetings they can't tell me what I'm missing",https://genius.com/Big-krit-i-heard-it-all-lyrics

You know what you've got to do. Do it... Do it!""

Yeah, It's the Return of 4eva, ho
2000 and heyond
Y'all thought it was over...
It's been a long time coming, runnin' still chasin'
A lotta folk been hatin' on mine and ain't make it
My trunk quakin', like the shifting of tectonic plates
I don't curb success, I put it in their face
Now, usually I don't boast or brag
But since I'm poppin' tags, how 'bout I act an ass?
Pull up, pull up, cleaner than a bitch
I got the whole world talkin' 'bout this country shit
Mississippi to the core, lames mad as I pass cause I ain't poor no more
Killing beats, fucking freaks on the top floor
Swangin' round when I drive, dodging pot holes
Bitch, I've been this way since I was snot-nosed
Went from barely eating meals, now I rock shows
Hell, I'm a chemist with the bass and I travel like my Granny in the iron seg, it's now or neva

I was fifth wheel, crawlin' bumpin' hella bass
Doing big shit back in 98'
Back when Ball and G were coming out hard (It's now or neva)
All I wanted was some rims on the candy car (It's now or neva)
'Cause forever is a mighty long time (It's now or neva)
'Cause forever is a mighty long time (It's now or neva)

Ain't much for free nowadays, gotta get paid
Making moves four-five-six hundred different ways
Top dropped and I'm feeling good
Chrome spinnin' bumper grillin' in my neighbourhood
Sun shining on the have-nots
I'm all in it for the win like it's my last shot
It took me five years to catch a flight
Now I tell that bitch to straighten up and fly right
I'm talkin' Jets like my partner Spitta
Creepin' crawlin' on the road like an armadillo
Big Sant that's my brother ain't none realer
Crackin' seals, rolling sour with my nigga DZA
Cinematic, what's the hat for?
We took that country shit and snuck it through the back door
Now what you know about a rebel?
A Mississippi nigga on Def Jam? It's now or neva

I was fifth wheel, crawlin' bumpin' hella bass
Doing big shit back in 98'
Back when Ball and G were coming out hard (It's now or neva)
All I wanted was some rims on the candy car (It's now or neva)

So stay cool and (whatever it is) you wanna do with your live nigga, do it, make sure you can't leave it alone, cause I can't

I always knew that it was (Something) in my heart that got me trippin'
Today like yesterday it ain't no different
The struggle, (gotta hold on me)
And I can't breathe nowadays
I wanna leave nowadays
But lord I'm knowin' that there's (somethin)
In this music and in my soul
The thought I might not blow
The shit just keeps on (bothering me)
And I don't know how long I can keep on like this
I need a sign so (whatever it is)
I'm meant to do, I need to find it
Cause the game is addictive
And I ain't gettin' out it
Cause (I can't leave it alone)
I try it and I try but they keep callin' me back
Yea they Keep callin me back because there's (somethin')
In my music that makes them feel me
The sweetest melody sometimes can heal me cause
(Gotta hold on me) like my grandma's hands
When I was younger, warmer than summer
Then I knew it's (somethin')
That was bigger than the money and the fame
The fact that so many can change
Keeps (botherin' me)
Yo but who am I to judge
It's been a while since I did it for the love
But (whatever it is)
I gotta pay for it
Sometimes happiness the only thing I pray for
(I can't leave it alone)
The will to ask questions like
How can George bush receive blessings
But I'm knowin that there's (something)
Or somethings that I cannot explain
Forget, forgive the change and the pain
(Gotta hold on me)
I gotta gun to keep me safe
Sometimes I drink and smoke to get away
Because it's (something)
That I know ain't right
Pops forgive me but this can't be life
And (it's botherin' me)
Because I wanna do better
But this rain seem to pour forever
So, (whatever it is)
I fiend for it, think of it, speak on it
Wish for it, dream of it, and lord

No, I can't leave it alone
And she said there was (something)
That draws her to me and it's meant to be
And you the only one that ever, ever, ever
(Gotta hold on me), yea
But you ain't been the same
There was somethin' that made you change
So tell me it was (somethin') or
Someone that made you feel good
Or way better than I ever could
Truth is (it's botherin' me)
But I'm cool with it
Just know if it's over today that you did it
But (whatever it is)
Don't let it take you to your grave
Protect yourself from aids, I know you want me to
But (I can't leave it alone)
I knew I couldn't turn this house of ours into a home
And I said there's (somethin')
That I've done to make you leave
Baby girl why you trippin' can't you see
That you always (gotta hold on me)
And I don't know what I can say
To make you stay but I know I gotta say
(Something) but now and then I get tired
Of you packin your bags and all this drama is
(Botherin' me) and I don't need it on my mind
Lately you been like this all the time
So (whatever it is) you feelin' guilty bout
Go and spit out while you accusin' me you must be cheatin'
Cause you (can't leave it alone) why you cryin'
See you can't deny it, I always had this feelin' it was (somethin')
That God gave me as a gift, the power to make words fit
I look at the sky, and dream of soarin' just as high
But as time goes by it always (somethin')
That will knock me off my track
Got to get back cause time is short, ay

And I don't know how long I can keep on like this
I need a sign so (whatever it is), I gotta pay for it

It's always something man
It's got a hold on me, heh
Real shit for real niggas
Real shit for real people, you know
It keeps bothering me that people don't wanna hear no real shit no more

I had some mixtapes out, did my thang...I ain't really had the opportunity I think
To speak from my heart, man like really just express myself, so I'mma give it to em as long as I can
I ain't counting bars, so don't expect no hook

Lord I been trying all these years, and I ain't never had a thing to say
Did it by myself not a soul here to motivate me, my family was cool
But when times got hard they was like fuck this rap shit
Go get yourself a job,
 
I thank god there were no run ins with the law
While I was riding with my folk and there was dope in the car
Momma forgive me I was in it for a minute,
 I was tired of 'em talking bout
My shoes and my fitted, ""G-Rod"" got killed and I shed a couple tears
Trying to forget that he's gone, Just remember that in here, remember that it clear
And where he at it's good, yea my nigga dead, but at least he out the hood
I'd leave if I could, that's what I plan to do, these niggas talk alot
Remind me of high school, but I thank you for your hating, appreciate the rumors
If you think that you're a winner than I'm glad to be a loser lord
No money, More problems
 that's just how it is, I lost another homeboy
That's just how it is, He told me Little cuz don't trip on these niggas"",I said
""Fuck that, I' gonna get paper and shit on these niggas, Rip on these niggas
Don't speak when I pass you, they sold 'cuz they wanted to, we sold 'cuz we had to
Bills don't pay themselves my nigga Hell Naw!! I'm about money that's what I'm
Trying to tell ya, moms and pops I promise that I won't fail y'all, my shit jam
It's only right that I outsell y'all, I dedicate my life to this music, I dropped
Out of college 'cuz my life is this music, Next nigga out the 'Sip, really can't
Tell me shit, the beats spoke to me when the books couldn't tell me shit
I wake up like another day another headache, my purpose get's no clearer
As I'm staring in this mirror,wash my face and my ass and hit the slab hard
If I don't say shit all day, nigga I thank god, for another breath, yes for
Another step, in the right or wrong direction still it's for a progress
Moving at pace that can't be seen, scraping everything, yea my pockets is
Fat because my stature lean, I got a mean team and they will see you dearly
The only way they show respect if I make 'em feel me, I mean that sincerely
I keep more beef than chili for anxious haters waiting, plotting, prayng
Out to kill me, Why the fuck I gotta live like this momma? All the set backs
Make me feel like this momma, another southern rapper yea I bet it label
Two of my best friends Patron and Cuervo at my table we sit and talk
Millions with some hope that we can speak it to existence hah
It's certain universal laws we abide by, the dealer lives on but a child
Dies in the drive by, titans collide and blocks go to war with no earthly idea
What the fuck we fighting for
, I paint pictures of this concrete jungle
Where the lions make deals with the hunters, snitch niggas kool aid heart
Pump bitch niggas, under pressure write a whole fuckin' list nigga please
I'm fighting demons like constantine
, constantly trying to take what belongs
To me but I review you niggas, follow 'suit nigga, if the convo ain't
About money then I mute niggas shit, I'm focused folk, you can quote this folk
I'm about to swarm the game like locust folk, they choking folk, guess
It's hard to swallow, If I leave the 'Sip then hell yea they'll follow
I talked to the father, he tells me ""Be real, nevermind what they want son
Just say what you feel""
, I'm knowing that the deals nowadays are some bullshit
Anything less than a mil' is some bullshit, because I know what I'm worth
Don't need a nigga to tell me..Shit! Music alone no gimmick, need a nigga to sell me

She’s My Biggest Fan,See Me On Top III,2010,"Girl - Now you wanna be all on me, when we was in the club you was dashing out, what was up with that?
Guy - What do you mean what was up with me in the club? The club ain't my scene, everybody checking you, checking me all flashy and shit. That's not my thing
Girl - You just boring
Guy - I ain't boring
Girl - (?)
Guy - If I'm so boring why you with me?
Girl - First of all, I ain't impressed by that, I'm with you because I'm boring too, alright

She my biggest fan, and I don't really know 'bout people
And I can't sing like Ne-Yo
Yea, she my biggest fan, she almost faint when I touch her
But, naw, I can't dance like Usher
She my biggest fan, and I ain't got money like Jay
But she love me anyway
Yea, she my biggest fan, I wasn't at a show when I met her
But I dig her forever cause
She my biggest fan

There really ain't no flashing lights
When I'm out here hustling, no paparazzi in sight
There ain't no scandal or hip hop panels
There will never be a Grammy sitting on my mantle
Or, I ask her but I roleplay wizzell
And she don't care that I can't act like Denzel
I put it down for her in the best way
I autograph a picture for her birthday
Yea, no Red Carpet events
Can't ball till I fall cause I gotta pay rent
But, she know I do the best I can
And she proud to know that I'm her man

She my biggest fan, and I don't really know 'bout people
And I can't sing like Cee-Lo
Yea, she my biggest fan, she almost faint when I touch her
But, naw, I can't spit like Busta
She my biggest fan, and I ain't got money like Wayne
But she love me anyway
Yea, she my biggest fan, I wasn't at a show when I met her
But I dig her forever cause
She my biggest fan

I ain't got the clothes or kicks
The condos or the fancy whips
Diamond chains with the matching wrist
I got one credit card and they might cancel it
The radio ain't never interviewed me
No T-R-L on M-T-V
No reality shows document on me
No screenplay performance on B-E-T
She ain't trippin', I won't get that large
In her eyes I know I'm still a star
But she know I do the best I can
And she proud to know that I'm her man


I might not sell a million records
Or be respected on a worldwide level
And I ain't been around the world like TIP
And I'll probably never sit down on 1-0-6
And I never get a call from Oprah like come through
Jump up and down for love like Tom Cruise
Hit home-runs like Barry Bonds do
That's with or without the juice
I love the way you do me
You nothing like a groupie
You satisfied with a starring role in my movie
On stage, grab my hand, and she won't let it go
Cause she always in the front row
My biggest fan",https://genius.com/Big-krit-shes-my-biggest-fan-lyrics

You like the retros? While I'ma get you none
Just work hard and stack your paper and go and get you some

Okay!

You want the best? You gotta grind
You want the good life? You want a nice whip?

I got it from my pops the rules to the game
Wake up  cigar and some change
I do it for the late great pimp and them niggas gettin' money
And those pimps still in training that ain't never ever done it
Product of the trill walkin' with Will
You chillin' with a player how it feel?


I just got paid workin' on the slayer
I got a little older but I'm still watching 
My stacks don't fold my workers don't talk back
Ain't got all my money baby girl you better walk back
Mack like Goldie Iceberg story
So cold with this pimpin' that my momma couldn't hold me
I keep em catching feelings what I want they willin'
We goin' out of space ay me and you gon' make a killin'

I know it's hard on you shawdy, hey, I know it's hard on you shawdy

Hey, I met ya on a bright summer day and it was cool
I thought you was fly and you thought I was rude
And you had you a dude, but he wasn't around
You liked a nigga's swag so you wrote your number down
We jumped our friendship off right
On the phone all day and all night
You told me you was feeling me, digging me
Seeing a connection with our signs and our energy
Askin' if I ever hurt a girl and if I would
I told you I never, ever cheat if I could
I could tell you was down, not the type just to cut
Yea, your boyfriend cheated cause you wouldn't give it up
Now I know you was testing me, seeing if I'm playin'
When you ask me 'bout marriage, I know just what you're sayin'
I'm cool with the choices and decisions that you make
I feel ya, so shawdy, hell yea I can wait
But baby girl


Now I ain't really trippin' when you going through my clothes, and you seeing all these numbers in my phone
And you ain't go to trippin' when I left the after party and I told you that I wasn't comin' home
Hey, now I don't go to trippin' when you talkin' to your girls, have them follow me around like a witness
Now she blowin' up my phone, she ain't never kept a nigga, puttin' her 2 cent all in our business
But I can see your concern cause I ain't actin' like I used to
I don't wanna talk cause I knowin' I confuse you
Love you baby girl but I don't think that I can budge
Ya ask me if I like it every time you see a tux
Your momma think I'm nice but your daddy hate my guts
I only care for you, so I don't really give a fuck

I think you a blessin' from God

Yeah God broke the mold when he designed me
I'm so forward with the flow you gotta rewind me
The lames don't work for you shawty come try me
I'm in the hood with the good that's where you find me
Ya'll artists can't write hits shit come sign me
Can't deny me I'm Jordan in his prime
I'm the type of rapper that drops all the time
Swag is vicious wordplay stupid
Take shots at your heart nigga but I ain't Cupid
No love here this my year
And I just that I'd make that clear

You don't really wanna throw them things that I didn't get to find on your brain
Turn the lights out

Turn the lights out
I'm the main attraction after me
Turn the lights out
The waitin' on the kid they wanna see me
Turn the lights out

The second time around the second time I clown on em
I'm talking 1980's I'm getting down on em
Turn the lights off I still shine I'm star bright
So far the kid balls star light
Hustle, pimpin' you know what I'm a bizzout
Niggas let their mouth dig hoes they can't get izzout
All this while to get in 
Masterpieces I've painted they trynna ruin my image
Shawty like to call me Picasso
Sistine Chapel you do it with the afro
I'm so Van Gogh think of me as art
I look like money in the dark


This time the last time I promise the haters
If I end your career I'm just doing you a favor
I'm saving your paper watch your album drop
Got a million dollar budget and his album flopped
Ringtones mean a million bucks
Yeah their singles be hard but their albums suck
Yeah the label eat good but the artist fucked
Just tell you what I seen that ain't happen to us
No, there's a difference between rappers and artists
Hoes and pimps, shooters and targets
I rip regardless our time is now

Be advised since I've been ridin' (?), now I'm back in the mix
Kickin' pimpin', the 3rd coast business they be loving my shit (?)
Niggas hatin', all of the while I was hittin' it big
Something wicked, that's what I'm spittin', so they come and they cheer
Hold up, I've never been the type to be playin' fishes up in the sea (?)
(?) chick still in the coupe while tryin' to lay some egg for me
Never that, bust on stomachs, backs, and all places

I never act, just for laughs let some broad taste it
Ironically it be they boyfriends who call hatin'
So while they kissy, kissy, I ball deeper with this paper
Truly married to my money because our love ain't over (?)


I was told as a youngin' don't let 'em take you for granted
And everything for the break independent on how you handle it
Most broads like packages shipped, they come in damaged
And most niggas sign as soon as they get hold of panties
But I send it back if it ain't good, that's how I'm rollin'
As a kid I never had toys that came already broken
Inhale some of this pimpin', I heard it's good for token
I speak it well, but sometimes I prefer the smokin'
It's like a friend till the end then I hold it closest
If it was wine I would get a glass and propose a toast
For all the women that be feelin' the kid
Then I tell them to close their eyes and take it deeper within",https://genius.com/Big-krit-boast-or-brag-lyrics
History Remembers Kings,See Me On Top III,2010," x2
Hey, when you see me, you should see me on top
I'mma get money and this shit won't stop
I always stood as a man, head to the sky
747 so fly
And if I die, bury me a legend
A king remembered in time, and that's like forever
Papa told me, remember one thing little nigga
What that is?

Real niggas in the hood like ""we feel you, KRIT""
Either you dead or paralyzed not to feel my shit
Or you just a hater, I see it in they eyes
More money, more problems, and more lies
Haters like flies, can't tell the difference
Soon as shit going down, they diving right in it
I'm shining light in it, I'm shining light on 'em
I'mma giant where I'm from, I got some height on me
I'm married to my money, throw some rice on me
If you owe me, pay up, respect my wife homie
You coming up short, you know the price homie
Next time put it all on your life homie
I'm still grinding for that big lick
I might shit on niggas when I get rich
Lord forgive me for these harsh gestures
But these haters never wanna see you doing better


Soon as I'm out, they pull me right back into it
A lot of prayer and patron how I get through it
Look into the eyes of a wounded soldier
I'll stop when I die or this movement over
It's straight up the gut cause they moving over
Sippin' lead (?), got next, and Young Krizzle told ya
I got the have-nots on call
I don't jump ship, I ride 'til the sails fall off
On 'til my whole family boss hog
I gotta couple pits (?) I can't call off
When I'm chopping down the block whip rimmed up
I gotta start dying if I plan to throw this M up
Mississippi 'til the death of me
At this point, I'm the last of a dying breed
The last of the Mohicans
The last king with his own kingdom


Father, I got my hand on my pistol
Screaming fuck the world as I'm looking through my rearview
Back to the corner, back to the slum
Gorilla warfare, we call it Vietnam
I've lost and I've gained and some have done the same
Pour out a little liquor for my rest in peace niggas
Shit
Real playas know the score now
Can't do good without a lame acting ho now
Niggas wanna show out
Cause you're getting money
That type of shit they on be Dave Chappelle funny
But we don't laugh at these pussy niggas
They sell booties, somebody throw cash on these pussy niggas

Don’t Lose Count (Original),See Me On Top III,2010,"Hey what that is? That's enough to live life we wanna live
I can count, a couple cars, a few broads, and a crib

I can count, that's enough for us to do it big
I can count, don't lose count
Don't lose count
Don't lose count
Don't lose count

Okay, all my homies ridin' clean, it's only right we do the same
Keep my eyes open, just in case they play that murder game
Shit I don't trip, collect my chips and get my ass on
Did without my childhood years, so I get my mash on
Rather sit back, count stacks, and fuck groupie hoes
Stop smokin' bud on occasion, we blowing stupid 'dro
Never been the type to trip, but today we go stupid though
He ain't grown up to be me, so you don't even know
Makin' hurricane to the point they can't see the flow
Used to have a lot to say, but haters they don't speak no more
Shut down the street kitchen, niggas they can't eat no more
Do this like 24/7, so we don't sleep no more


Okay, you get a mil today, my nigga that's a mil tomorrow
I'm your local hood bank, if you need mils to borrow
No credit, no debit, I can deal with it
If you can't pay, don't lie, keep it real with it
Everybody wanna be a king or a kingpin
You a king, I'm a king, fuck it we all kings then
Did to me, all about your cavalry, and your king's men
Some niggas that will die for your shit that you believe in
Money just a tool, nigga, to find more time
To get more money, to get money and then die
I said:
Money just a tool, to buy a nigga more time
To get more money, gonna blow it all and then die


Okay, everybody got a dream, while I'm just getting mine
Either you risk it all and ball or you just getting by
Are you the type to go all in, and you don't even try
Are you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?
Are you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?
Are you the dope boy in your life or are you just getting high?
I'm trying to tell you a little something you don't get in school
By any means necessary, get money when the bills are due
Get money when you need some food to feed you and your family too
Don't worry 'bout your kids cause clearly half of them ain't feeling you
Fact that you get old should be the only thing that's killing you
And stay out of grown folk biz, cause that's what children do
Put God first and your awards will come in large amounts

I feel like spending, life's a shopping spree
I got a horrible habit, buy everything I see
And everything I be, and everything I love
And everything I am, in God I trust

So many turned bitch and that type I can't trust
So bygones is bygones and I am a movement
Talkin' all good but I'm known through this music

I reign supreme, give me the cream or I'm shootin'
Pistol whip the driver in the head just for movin'

Late night mission, so I popped a couple (?)
Ski mask and black glove, I hit 'em with the fire
If niggas actin' tough then we takin' niggas lives

The stupid nigga (?), the chrome millimeter
Extra clips in case a nigga in the bushes
Tear through him like tissue, I leave his chest mushy
The hit was spectacular, miraculous
Scored some keys, now I'm feelin' fabulous
100 thou in the duffle
I'm leavin' niggas muffled
No witnesses for the shit we did
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
Got a house being built, so I stack them bricks
I'm livin' large, Lambos in garage
Credit is A1, no more knives and guns
Shit was gravy, I got a little lazy
Niggas start talkin' in that hood, bitch page me
Raided a spot with AKs and Glocks
They got her and her boyfriend tied up at the docks
She ain't know who to call so she call my phone
Now they ask you who done it? So you call my phone
Hang up, grab the banger, threw Biggie in the changer
I'm seein' cars pull up, so I know I'm sensing danger

Stunt Man,See Me On Top III,2010,"Hey my trunk vibrating and my rims keep skating
And the shawdies keep choosing cause they know what's going down
I was on that 5 minutes wait for parking lot pimping, when a bad chick approached me, she was caramel brown
I told her get in, get in, get in, get in
I told her get in, get in, get in, get in
I told her get in, get in, get in, get in
Cause I pull up, stuntin' on they ass

Yup, I'm the man, cup in my hand
Doing what I want, doing what I can
Do it for my fans, real ass niggas
Independent women and them trill ass niggas
I'mma blow 'em money, every day
I'mma ball out, every way
I'mma real nigga, do it cause I love it
I'm like Evel Knievel, I'm stunting out in public
Call me stunt man! Daredevil!
I got that woodstock, that heavy metal
Flashing like lights, toss hoes like dice
Get money, get money, this ain't happen overnight


Hey, I'mma boss now, I call plays
I'm runnin' on 'em, that's all day
That's all the way, that's (?)
If the folk know the play, call an audible
Vest on my chest, that's just my past
(?) my dash? Leave you on your ass
My team on mash, juggernaut for real, ho
They knew I was the stunt man, so what they in my grill for?
Jump fresh all the time, feelin' like a million bucks
Billion, trillion, gazzillion, what's after that? A million bucks
I'm riding like a million trucks, strong like a million hogs (?)

I think I'm gonna smoke a little more, drink a little more

Go and get you a couple of 'em, cause you ain't even bustin'
Okay, when I get money, I'm talkin' trips on the private plane
A green-eyed Brazilian model that's into exotic things
And I've been blowin' exotic flames, stackin' my cash
A couple rocks on my fingertips like life is a bad bitch
Hey, I shine harder than sunlight, that's way past flashy
Paint wheel (?) like a nympho, my whip too nasty
26's ain't big enough like 30's is average
And they like Krizzle you spazzin'
I know, they know


Monsoon in the club, hurricanes are played out
Buyin' everything I see, shawty just have it laid out
My pockets is quite green, my charm is a light beam
I'm rockin' that (?) dodger like niggas rock white tees
My wrist, icy, that strawberry Coca-Cola
Yea, the top on the Benz, push and pop open just like a soda
She swallow just like a cobra, I'm talkin' the whole thing
A nigga be stupid fly, she gave me her whole brain
Diploma for gettin' change, I'm hustler educated
Yea, the whip came customized, so you know that I graduated
A master at gettin' paper, professional stunner, ho

Happy Birthday Hip Hop,Last King 2 (God’s Machine),2011,"Twin states mane: Alabama, Mississippi
Big KRIT, Yelawolf
Happy, happy birthday, happy birthday...

I used to do backspins, no Adidas suit
In my grandmama's house, listening to Coup
Straight out the country like a pair of boots
With arrow pulled back, you been shot, no apparel to match
I was hip-hop before I hopped to be hip
Some dirty British Knights, tied up, size 6
Don't give me the spoon to cut my pie with
I get it, hand scooped the poofs under my eyelids
I was bumpin' that Tela and that UGK, and that group home
And Skinny Pimp from Tennessee, and I knew the songs
Mystikal, muthafucka: put your boots on
That's mustard: no Grey Poupon
Geto Boys trick or treat: let's go home
Deep dish D's: drop two tones
And I know Alabama ain't your birthplace
But I just come to celebrate: happy birthday
Hip-hop

Yelawolf and Big KRIT on some new shit
We got that firewater, so keep your candles lit
Happy birthday hip hop!
Mississippi/Alabama and it don't stop
The door slamming and the rims chop
Twin states from the bottom, now we on top
So happy birthday, hip hop
We worldwide and it don't stop

I'm hollerin' breathe little shawty
Just look what I done bought ya
The very best that I possess from 'neath that country water
Like preaching from the altar, I break bread with you hip-hop
Just show me where the sauce, a piece of mind is what it cost ya
The beginning of the better, return of forever
Like Pete Rock in the lab, no telling what we'll chef up
You find a will to flow once the vinyl dust settle
I was digging in the crates, just bring a 40 and your shovel
Old school Chevy, sprayed it Ole Miss Rebel
My definition for lizard crawlin' and heavy metal
808 bass in, haters strut facing
While you was Kid N Playin', I was UGKing
""Say it ain't so, KRIT"", bitch, I'm just saying
Don't play me like no sucka
These Alpines leave you muffled
Country bumpkin hella gumption, tell them niggas take that
Happy birthday hip-hop, now show me where the cake at


Bonita fried, apple pie bum put me on
(Put 'em up) waffle house, 2Pac's rock song
You see I had to dig to find the hieroglyphics
My mama didn't know about Del and Souls of Mischief
See the Bible Belt gave me the Holy Spirit
But it didn't give me rap, cuz I wasn't supposed to hear it
So I had to walk under them Rebel flags
With my hoodie inside out, with Adidas on the tag

Who would've thunk it, I think we onto something
Like a speaker on my chest, no holding back they hear me coming
If you check my gun function, I've been 'bout it 'bout it
The royalties within my jeans and they so outta pocket
Back when Screw was popping, Them 4s and vogues was chopping
The swangas swung like pendulums and boppers kept bopping
Reminiscing on the golden times
3000 rhymed over noise so organized",https://genius.com/Big-krit-happy-birthday-hip-hop-lyrics

Rollin in this caddy ho looking like yo daddy ho
Say you from the wood but I know you from the valley though
Always got yo hand out man you know these cali hoes
My life is a video but you ain’t got no cameo
Call me the banana boat let me see your cantaloupe
Don't invite your homegirls them hoes look like antelopes
She want me to ram her though, right on the pia-a-no
I was like a-ah no, Fuck am I D'angelo?
Yes I a-a-am a pro, and I seen your bitch before
And she told me this before, Yes I a-am a ho
And I want to leave you but you just won't let me g-go
She want me to change her life, I got her a change of clothes
Million dollars ain't a lot, niggas just be aiming low

Chattin' hoes

Bad broad, love to fuck, with her head down and her ass bent
No money spent, cruise the scene, put on game to pursue a dream
Don’t be fraternizing with these lame niggas, You need a king well I'm Akeem
Earth stood still when I dropped my top and I step my foot out the door
See the wonderful smell, and compliments on a pimp
And you wonder just how she chose
See I wasn't just riding high I was sittin' sky high I don't walk on feet, I soar
Y'all speedin' to fast with ya foot on the gas and 2 miles per hour on these hoes
Go 2 miles per hour and I roll, in an old school drop top
And keep the bass on bump jabbawockee in the trunk, my shit done pop locked
And I ain't trippin' on yours shawty don't get no burn if the broad ain't top notch

Cause I grinding and chasing the dream
This ain't only for me
Say what?
Cause I do it for the home team! (I grind)
For the home team (I ball), for the home team (Stand tall)
For the hometeam, I do this for the home team! (Go real)
For the home team (I work), for the home team (Go bezerk)
For the home team, I do this for the home team! (Uh!)

Lit fast and blunt full'a lit grass
Big wheels on a whip bitch, big ass
In the South all we do is get cash
Can't do shit but copy and get mad
Eat your heart out, suck a nigga
?
That's why they don't fuck with me
Can't walk like this, so it's tough to see
Off sets on a 65' gt
Though the south spill oil like BP
Uhh, but I clean up nice, married to the game
No prenup, nice
No honeymoon, I ain't even throw rice
Eat the whole pie won't leave no slice
Spit so sick gotta play that twice
Call Young G I don't need to rock ice
Yeah, and you don't even gotta ask
All up front need all my cash
I go hard then all ya'll ass
You can go ahead and kiss all my ass
That Marlins stay on my hat
You know this that Florida shit
Ya'll niggers know what it is
Dirty South we run this shit!


Hey ball out with me, crawl out with me, hear a lot of screams Saying fall out with me
I'm all out with it, like he ain't saying nothing
Niggas bark all day (woof), ain't scared of nothing
Still in the hood like C
Autographing titties and hoes is taking photos
Of the baddest of bitches, bust it open call it porno
Smokin' live cuz ?
Higher then the bitch, skyscraper and taller
Fly as the kicks
Rims to big that the tire won't fit
We drinking fire water and blow fire on this
One of yours could mind my wrist
And mind my tag, bitch too close shit mind my swag
Trunk on glow, tool on deck, the blind could admire my flash
I think I'm on fire, Patrón, 6
 Tires, supreme, whippin
 look at it swang
Never seen a sound? well look at it bang!
Look at my name! Who said I ain't King?
Stand there, throw some paper look at it rain
Pull out my label, pull on my frame
Reclining with diamonds against my brain


From the Atl to Orlando, ain't a state that I can't go
I just sit in the house on my ass
Cause you all already know what I stand for
Painting pictures, I'm Van Gogh
Promoters paid like Santro
In the studio wearing sandals
Blowing blue grass, no banjo
Was a hoodlum like Bun B
I'm good son, I'm comfy, like Gandi
But niggers still wanna jump me like bungee cords
So I play my cards smart like Gin Rummy, for
Rappers thats mad cause they can't out rap this country boy!
Plus their bitches want me, you act like ya'll married with kids
Who are you? Al Bundy?
Hit a strip club, fuck a stripper
Without throwing a bill up, that's chauncey
I got a pretty pussy passenger with me
And she ain't wearing no undies
Ha! oh my bad is this your chick up in my front seat?
Obviously she likes being around bread
I call the bitch lunch meat
But I'm tight with your ends like Shiancoe
We tell em' lies, we prank hoes
Got a SunTrust, on wheels, nigga that what I call a bank roll
I reign supreme with the same regime
With killer hooks, my games Kareem

4eva and a day shawdy pimpin' don't stop
Niggas road kill like I roll wheels
Breaking hoes down like pines and drug deals
Once a bitch ho she get down on the floor
And once she get down she get down like a pro
Man Hol' up, Ho' up, tow up, we gone show out
Show up, slow up, don't roll, bitch what you know bout

Krizzle on the gas, smash my digital dab lab
150 like mad megs, I pull up and act bad
On chicken that cluck, cluck
Hop in but don't touch the
Buttons if you fuckin'
You so welcome in my cutlass
On the seat like get it right, get it in
Goin' hard on boulevard with candy car my freaks a ten
Even when the bill closed, back door, sneak 'em in
Then bust it wide open and they know we'll never meet again
Thats just how it is when everywhere the broads on ya
I pull up on the curb, as long as hoods got corners
Ain't searchin' for no stragglers, I accompany the loners
Here pimpin' served cold, but you can still smell the aroma
I take 'em to a
Higher plane givin' game to the lames for fee
Paid to told to get throwed because this ain't for free
I am what they not, what they claim to be


Swinging down on 'em in somethin' they never seen
In the old school back to the future feelin' supreme
Super clean super hard ho, I got it on lock now
Propellers lookin' stellar I might just chop the block down
Why stop now? D-ah up in box hot
How I do it when I does some shit we don't talk 'bout
Its all in the game, your man just a lame
I'm just tryin' to put some pressure on your 5-4 frame
Ain't a damn thang changed but the way I get the cheese
Got 'em waitin' on they knees when I touch-down overseas
Hell yea I got the keys, but I ain't talkin' bout no bricks
I'm talkin' upscale bed & breakfast hippin', hittin' lits
Don't nobody talk shit, the way I talk shit
When I step in, they strip, they know its big son bitch
You can't deny it when I'm shinin', tell them all sales are final
Think yo' girl won't bring me mines, then yo' ass in denial",https://genius.com/Big-krit-4eva-and-a-day-lyrics

Get a whiff of the aura it's hereditary
Girl I do it nothin' less than legendary


First off, shawdy let me ball a bit
I got the type of Candy paint that will make you lick up all of it
Sticky icky dreams, crude to seen, and I drop the roof
Cause once you lose your cool, ain't no tellin' what these (?) do
Any bitch can get in the way and sometimes you jus' gotta let 'em go
God gave you all of that and sometimes you jus' gotta let it show
I'll just let you know off the real though
I'm curious where the hit bowl
Let me get deep in your mental, B-P in your tempo
I know just what you need, so lets not waste no time
I'll work you like a B, rip and break you down
Shawdy let me see it, let me see it then
Over let me see it
Don't be teasing let me beep it
Cause I know how to treat it
Like a old school, display it in my show room

I'm comin' home
Like I never left, cruise the city while bendin' corners
Chunk the deuce to the non-believers, and parlay with my playa homies
They knew just want it took for me to be the man that I am today
Channel the son tears and money black thats why good lord paved the way
For a nigga to see everything a nigga would dream
Right here before his eyes
And removed though they never had good intentions
I beat the devil while he in disguise
From a mile away, I'm doin' good, and I'm proud to say
That I can pay my bills and buy my meals and woke my wheel
In my home from where my family stay
If need be finally be there for them like they were for me

The players that never will
Ride old schools ingrained in
Wheels of Steel
I know about the slums and hard times
Boats and sewers lines
Cops that kick doors in
Black eye shines
This more than rhymes
I do it for the ones

I ain't the one for politicin'
Just liquor bottle sippin'
One the corners with my partners talkin' life after death
And the meaning of empty boxes that sit on my shelf
Too real to beg for meals, too proud to ask for help
I know we pray, we sell weed, married for life
To this game we in my friend passed the rice
Lets get it, more than we got it
Fillin' my pockets
With petty dreams, of being king of parking lot and
My homie lobby until they shot him
Polo down blood spotted, so why bother
Being fresh, when you ain't fly enough for death
I don't do this for my health
But for those that ain't here


I do it for those with less fortune
They ain't got a lot but yet they still bless they portion
My mic got distortion but I talk this shit regardless
Thankful for my oddness in the neighborhood that birthed me
But then I talk that shit that make the government research me
Yea, I do my best, Pimp is gone, Bun here, after death I do the rest
How do me, and hopefully, they may say easy to do you
Know you feel like its in vain sometimes, nigga, we do too
We boohoo
Then we laugh, then we get up off our ass
Quietly acquire fortune so we yellin' free at last
We are so much more than any condo we ever closed
Can we keep if we get it, shit we never know",https://genius.com/Big-krit-4-tha-1s-lyrics
Where It’s At,Last King 2 (God’s Machine),2011,"I'd like to dedicate this song
To them old flea market outfit wearin' ass niggas man
I ain't ever seen you in no Cadillac
And I ain't never seen you with a bad bitch man
Gone with all the bullshit, get up off the booboo man
If the pimp was here right now, he would expose you

You say you swinging on 40's well where yo 'lac
You say you got all the hoes well where they at
You said you stackin' that bread
Yea bitch I heard what you said
Don't talk about it, be about it, where it's at
You said you packin' that iron, nigga why you lyin'
She ain't gonna let you get it pimpin' it stop tryin'
You said yo' stackin' that cash we not believin' yo ass
Don't talk about it, be about it, where it's at

I'm sick and tired of niggas lyin' about the shit that they do
But don't get it twisted those bitches be ridiculous too
Thats why I hustle by my lonely speakin' only the truth
If the profit margin ain't large enough, I'm chunkin' the deuce
Show some respect, stop talkin' out the side of you neck
You say you ballin' why you stallin' then? cut me my check
All you do is fabricate the truth with special effects
You need to take them monkey diamonds
Off you neck and you wrists, ya bitch
Yeah you talk a good game but it ain't no truth in it
If it ain't no proof then it ain't no use for you to claim that you pimpin'
You violatin' codes, (one) gain a soul not told
(two) separate friends from foes
(Three) never put trust in hoes, (four) what all glitters ain't gold
Bars and seven they sold
Still ain't sellin no records, you so irrelevant bro
You speak about it but nobody never seen it though
Difference between us, I don't say it if I don't mean it ho

You say you swinging on 40's well where yo 'lac
You say you got all the hoes well where they at
You said you stackin' that bread
Yea bitch I heard what you said
Don't talk about it, be about it, where it's at

You said yo' stackin' that cash we not believin' yo ass
Don't talk about it, be about it, where it's at

Hey now for starters I ain't fuckin' with no frauds
Came in houses in old schools in they garages
Like every bitch that they done fuck was dying for menages (?)
Its all make believe these niggas lookin' like mirages
Bank account margin ain't equivelant to starvin'
Niggas in the club tryin' to floss, can't pay they mortgage
Actin' like he boss catchin' flights and takin' off
Wouldn't bust a grape front like he might break you off
Shit now Hol' up, I ain't trippin'
Keep it real if you'se a poor pimp, some of ya'll niggas so simp
You'd rather trick than buy more shrimp
Or rather blow up like four blimps
Get my gators slam my dough
Ball in my paint with a cup full of drank
Do what you ain't and break these hoes
Pull up, hop out so clean, talkin' diamonds and wood
Do it bigger than big, know you can't but you should
Know you would if you could, I'm just stating the facts
Don't talk about it, be about it, where it's at

You say you swinging on 40's well where yo 'lac
You say you got all the hoes well where they at
You said you stackin' that bread
Yea bitch I heard what you said

War Stories,Last King 2 (God’s Machine),2011,"Yeah...
Self Scientific
Come and please prepare for war
War Stories (Uh huh)
Something about life and shit...

Little Dony been hustling since he was 11
The name sake of his pops an Old G hood legend
Big Dony was a rider so he felt that pressure to be a rider just like him
Long as he could remember
A very short period of time, life all change once since his pops got life when he was 9
Moms had a very hard time keeping Dony in line
She can see he would start to show signs the product of a father who cares but ain't there
Who build a set niggas repped and Dony was right there
She worked nights so little Dony was left with a promiscuous auntie and his crazy uncle Jeff
Jeff is a gangster, people call him Jay he became a role model once
Dony run away, but Jay the wrong nigga to betray
Jay don't do nothing than fuck bitches and serve all day
Dony got influenced by the cake he was only 10 when stole his first 8 ball from Jay
And gave it his aunt's friend, Fay who said, ""I should tell Jay"" but gave him 50 dollars away
So this is how Dony spent most of his days, needless to say he's still hustling until this day

How can we survive (survive man), when they ain't making no way for us to get out (til you out the door)
In the streets is no glory, just another war story

Lil Tasha been hustling since she was a teen
A product of a prostitute and a father she never seen
On top on being a ho, moms was a fiend so Tasha was raised in a group home where she met Jean
Jean was 17 and the oldest in the house, her and Tasha formed a bond just seeking a way out
Jean had a man named Slim, Slim was 21 drove a benz and was a neighborhood pimp
He would make Jean turn tricks
He even convinced Jean to get Tasha caught up in the mix
Tasha took tuning like a pro, so Slim dropped Jean, kept Tasha cause she made a better ho
Tasha got influenced by the street and low self-esteem kept her spiraling until she got bleak
So like her mom she too became a fiend, now little Tasha is old Tasha doing the same thing


War stories tell the toll most pay what they soul
Live Fast and Die Young, like who needs to be old
Pride ourselves on the jewels and the freshest of clothes
And tap dance for materials on the tightest of ropes
Let me see your drive that benz through heaven's doors
No nigga, those rims can't handle that road
Poverty will make you do some strange things player
Steal out your mama purse while she was hard at work
We pray so hard in church, clap till our hands hurt
Let the preacher touch our foreheads hoping it work
Get the devil up off me why don't you
Can't let the sins of my mom and father haunt me
You know that ill advice you get sometime
When they feel better with each other and they can't see eye to eye
Cause they get by to by and that means check to check
And you just wanna be free, scared of what what comes next",https://genius.com/Big-krit-war-stories-lyrics

Now, I ain’t trippin' on no critics or no bloggas
Now, I ain’t trippin' on no critics or no bloggas
But they don’t know the pressure of an artist
To be the hardest rapper alive
Most rappers would die to see a microphone rating over 5
 or grace the cover
That type of look'll make you slap your partner's baby mother
Settle down with your girl, break her off without a rubba
See, they tried to count me out 'cuz I was country
Wouldn’t listen to my records 'cuz my name sound funny

They think its jiggaboo, why would I mister you?
You don’t see them dots?
It’s an acronym bitch, I thought you knew!
But they tried to get me riled up
Fourth quater, fifth personal, they down to get me fouled up!
Nah I ain’t tripping though
I just pick & roll out the way of those chicken hoes
For the give and go
I went from ashy to classic mayne
So what the fuck have you done lately?
This the big payback!",https://genius.com/Big-krit-the-big-payback-lyrics
Born On The Block,Last King 2 (God’s Machine),2011," x2
See, I was born on the block
And I was raised on the block
And they wonder why I talk this way
They wonder why I talk this way

I was born on the block, raised on the block
Never slang (?) but I knew some things on the block
My people under streetlights trying to provide
For they fam, so they scram from the laws to survive
Up and on it all night, same story different day
Kids need food and clothes so we going all the way
Momma got cancer and they only giving her till May
Collections team callin', cause the hospital pay is late
Baby momma trippin', she tired of the strugglin'
He feel the same way, cause he tired of the hustlin'
World is too cold, so we screamin' fuck the government!
President and all, Democrats and Republicans
Sick of the smugglin', takin' daily chances
Prayin' with his fam to turn this section to a mansion
Playin' with the flames, don't get burned, so he dances
Hopin' to make it out, takin' penitentiary chances
 x2

Raised on that Martin Luther King
A nigga had a dream and a scheme
Servicing (?) fiends
If you ain't never seen the site of a young teen
Sprinting toward the car like a track team in spring
You wouldn't understand how the product is in his hand
Wrapped in cerane, tucked by the garbage can
Can potentially grow this boy into a man
You see him and disregard him, another dope man
Got a woman that he love, he don't wanna see her dance
Had a baby by the girl, he call her Ms. Little Man
His momma been on welfare all of his life
Took her out the projects her house and picket fence white
The same animal that chop rock, bust choppers
Sent two sisters to school to become doctors
Feds finally came and gave the young brother life
He said, my family made it out, fuck the law, I'm tight
 x2

Okay, I get it how I live, no silver spoons or handouts
Crack viles covered the park-ground that we ran 'round
Chunk his ass for change, no regrets, pride or shame
Refrain from giving eye because we strugglin' all the same
One bill away from being in the same position
Standin' on the corner with these stones I whipped up in my kitchen
Watchin' for them undercover laws and those niggas paid to tell
My partner going through it, prayin' this dope will sell
Taking chances just to make it out the hood
Get jammed and do time, but did just what he could
Got kids that need food, so I'm taking up the slack
His girl ain't shit, and theres no tellin' when he's comin' back
And they wonderin' why we fight for every yard, never heal from these scars
Never give so we take, any day we can starve
And I ain't sayin' that it's right
But it's life, we're tired of the dark, failed for searchin' for the light
Earnin' stripes
 x4

They wanna be down with the last King, Two!",https://genius.com/Big-krit-born-on-the-block-lyrics
Ova Da Sky,Last King 2 (God’s Machine),2011,"It might be the herb or the rims on the curb
That got me seeing so high
It must be the clothes or the suicide doors
Make 'em break the next exit pass by
It can't be the jewels, I think its the shoes
That make me so fly, how fly?

Now I could rap about cars, more exotic broads
Buyin' out the bar like I'm some kinda star
Money bags galore, condos by the shore E
Elaborate punchlines just to dazzle you some more
I could talk about hoes, how I break 'em blindfold
Hand behind my back with my mouth taped closed
No, talk when it's hot shit, chillin' when its cold
The cushy-cushy highs and the old school lows
And can tell you bout French, the diamonds on my neck
The liquor in my system but I still didn't wreck
Yea, all of that is cool but its mean none the less
I'm fly, so way up high


Now I could rap about haters, guns with the lasers
Stripper pole professionals and sexual favors
Ralph Lauren uniform, purple those labels
Ferraris and cars, just horses in the stable
Yea, we can keep it pimpin' from here down to Jamaica
Kingston to Dubai, wherever planes can take us
But how about the future? I'm winnin' and they losers
My debonairaness, the swag that might seduce ya
The, the stars that I-I reach for
Fell short and off course and landed on Mars
Yea, all of that is cool but it's me nothin' more
I'm fly, so way up high


Ey, Now I can talk about the high
The way it peels when it landed get hits runways from out the sky
The way the sunrise and how the time change up
The way the foreign car sound different when it crank up
Or maybe 'bout the doughs, up in expose
Inside same color pedals of a rose
Bustin' maybe on the chocolate got us
Minaj with the yella', well I'm just bein' modest
So whether you can mop it, cash filled pockets
The after sails, or seven seas, thats before we dock it
Bro, we gonna save all that for next time

I ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I can’t
And understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am
Didn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings
Scrappin' from the game I'll be King just you watch
See KRIT ain't just a name it's an acronym
King Remembered in Time but none come after him

The Vent,Return of 4Eva,2011,"A mother lost her child, I tried to ease her pain
""It's only God's will"", she says she felt the same
It’s funny how the sun will up and bow to rain
As if the clouds couldn’t stand to see me outside again
Wrote a rhyme that was kind with some vision to it
Bottom line it might expand your mind if you listen to it
Too much shine can dull the soul
If you feel how I feel, then I'll rap some more
How can the devil take my brother if he's close to me?
When he was everything I wasn’t but I hoped to be
I get a little honest and I ask myself
If the time come, will you save me if I ask for help?
Sent my mind on a journey to the outter most
To document what it had seen and CC me the notes
And ask Kurt Cobain why, cause I need to know
He stopped when he had such a way long to go
I saw love in the eyes of a perfect stranger
She overlooked my caring heart in search of a gangster
Will we ever be together only time will tell
She call my phone and talked to me as her eyes would swell
I put my problems in a box beside my tightest rhymes
Under lock and key, buried deep off in my mind
And when it gets too full and I can't close the lid
I spaz on my family and my closest friends
Trade my materials for a peace of mind
I am so close to heaven, hell, I just need some time
Who cares about life and the high’s and low’s
Maybe I should write another song about pimps and hoes
Cars and clothes, idol gods, golden calves, Louis scarves
I do this for the love and it’s free of charge
I don’t need jail to be behind bars, this is purely art
In my grandma's household, this was surely taught
Don’t be naïve, yeah, these times is hard
In the midst of all the glamour I hope you find God
I never wished to be the burden bearer
But souls need saving and it’s now or never
Shock value is all they wanna see
It’s us against them and it’s just you and me
Trying to take heed what I say in my songs
Forgive me if I ever ever steered you wrong
Most people stop for signs but I driven through it
If it don’t touch my soul then I can’t listen to it
The radio don’t play the shit I used to love
Or maybe I am just growing up
I never seen a star on a red rug
If I wanna see stars, I just look above
To the heavens

I know you’ve been down so long
So I’ll be stronger for you
I know you’ve been down so long
'Cause I’ve been down too
Yes I understand
What you're going through
Yes I understand
'Cause I'm going through it too
I pray that you find your way
And all things old become new
I pray that you find your way
For my sake cause I'm lost too
Yes I understand
What you're going through
Yes I understand
Cause I'm going through it too
I lost my friend this morning
Woke up screaming her name
She meant so much to me
I'm scared I won’t be the same
Hope you understand
What I'm going through
Hope you understand
When I call out for you

Yeah I remember it so clearly
Rappin’ to my pop about the cars and the clothes
Shrimp and the lobster that I heard about
Like word of mouth
The UGK tape and Scarface will turn ya out
I was like 13 thirsting for a good beat
Scoping for a studio talkin’ bout I spit heat
Like Ball & G, on that pimp type shit
Three 6 had me crunk on that late night tip

I played ball for a minute, did I mention wasn’t in it
Writing rhymes on my glove so I will never forget em
Had to quit it, didn’t feel it back in high school
Rather write poems, known for flowing, thats what I do
Couldn’t be little Zac forever, peace to my big brother
Follow ya dreams baby, thats word to my grandmother
When I hear the streets tappin’, my beats kickin’ my flow

I told them call me KRIT, they told me change my name
Don’t be alarmed if you don’t make it, thats just part of the game
Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&R’s searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn’t afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal
Cause, it wasn’t right sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm
Like, this my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
Watching out, when all the others used to doubt
Felt my pain and pointed down and said “Son, your time is now”
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
Thats between her and the lord I’ll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine, XXL, the Vibe and whatever inbetween
It’s safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Don’t let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was once considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers

Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk

Waitin' with my hands out
Broke in the hood, they give a damn 'bout
Braggin' to my homies 'bout the hoes I fucked
Drinkin' bottles after bottle, plus I smoke too much
I never had a job that would pay me well
I took what I could cause they gave me hell
Spend what I stole on some clothes and kicks
My ex-girl say I won't amount to shit
But she suck and fuck when my car roll up
Tried to fuck her sister but she talk too much
Her mama shake her head whenever I come 'round
Whatever high I had when I saw her might come down
I barely go to church but I say I will
I bow my head right before I eat my meal
The world's fucked up and they claimin' I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

Waitin' on a play to come through
Chillin' with my homeboys plottin' on you
Watchin' movies how to come up quick
Recruiting young niggas I can come up with
Barely read books, but they down to shoot
Live life breaking rules, they got something to prove
Parents ain't around they got nothing to lose
Wave the tool on a fool for some brand new shoes
Little child runnin' wild in the streets
Wanna be a G so he look up to me
Try to hit the block and make a name
Claim he caught a body now he got it and he feeling all the same
Till the family of the victim come knocking
Bailing through the corners of the ghetto till they shot him
Youth still dyin' and they claimin' I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

I don't wanna be another nigga

I don't wanna be another nigga

I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

Always trying to sell you something
Don't really know shit, but trying to tell you something
Tap dance if you want him to
Coulda' fed the hungry but he bought them jewels
Won't ever look back cause he gotta keep movin'
Even if he leave his own people Bamboozled
Takin' credit like he did it by himself
Too much pride to realize that he really had help
Only judge a man by his wealth
He ain't me so he can't feel how I felt
He saw me walkin' and he ain't look back - too scared
We make eye contact:
So he can say he didn't see me when he drove by
And I could say he didn't see me and it's alright
He just want the fame from the game, it's a shame
I bet he think I'm just another nigga

American Rapstar,Return of 4Eva,2011,"An A&R once told me
“You can determine the worth of a song within 15 seconds of it playing”
With complete and utter lack of the fact
That it takes takes all 3 minutes and 40 seconds of a song
To comprehend what I’m saying
It ain't a single if it don’t fly
It ain't a hit if it don’t ride
Now he couldn’t tell me the components of a smash
But the ringtones were their all-time high
And a rappers only as big as his chain, the flashier the better

They say ""money make the world go round""
You never lost til you lose your crown
And they don’t love you till you’re under ground
Or when you’re maxing out your bank account
Yeah, you do it all just to live the life
Even if it means you don’t live it right
And even if it means you don’t survive the night
But if even if you do you won’t survive the hype
Of an American rapstar

Push it to the limit (Why?)
Just to get up high with a wood grain kitted?
Ride around town like I never lived in it
Gun in my dash, pray I never kill with it
I’m that real with it
Got my eyes on the prize
Bills still due, motherfuck 9-5
Searching for a freak that wanna fuck once or twice
Wanna buy a bottle but I ain't paid my tithes
This ain't no lie, I got a vision and a masterplan
To hit the block and blow up like a Taliban
I make it where the plane never have to land
I make it where them lames never stand a chance
Shit, you’ll never know, only time’ll tell
You either starve or you find the scale
You either buying or you tryna' sell
You either fall or you grind the rails

They say ""money make the world go round""
You never lost til you lose your crown
And they don’t love you till you’re under ground
Or when you’re maxing out your bank account
Yeah, you do it all just to live the life
Even if it means you don’t live it right
And even if it means you don’t survive the night
But if even if you do you won’t survive the hype
Of an American rapstar

So watch me get it how I live
Waiting on my moment, screaming fuck how they feel
Dodging jail cells and them pigs down to kill
They shot Oscar Grant swear it gave a nigga chills
Lets keep it real, if you ain't looking keep your eyes closed
Will I pay what I owe? Only God knows
I ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I can’t
And understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am
Gotta keep ya finger on the trigger
Pac died, Biggie died, they ain't found a killer
Momma say she worried ’cause I rap about the Government
And how the Church caked other people out there struggling (its real though)
I just call it how it is, folk
I’m breathing for a reason, what you here for?
They got it where the villains who we cheer for
Cause they murdered all the heroes

They say ""money make the world go round""
You never lost til you lose your crown
And they don’t love you till you’re under ground
Or when you’re maxing out your bank account

Fuck what they talkin', nah, it ain’t about talent
It’s no longer an art, niggas piss on your canvas and parade

Farther than you go before,
 but still, you block the road some more

I just wanna be successful...

Tap yo feet, tip yo brim, and sell it back to yo kin
I don't rap, I spit hymns, my God's bigger than them

Reclining, shining like a pimp s'posed
Life ain't nothing but an EQ of highs and lows

Young Krizzle the newest out the south
So it's going down

With this evil major leaguer and these fuschia alligators
Shawty got me fucked up
I'm never slipping, never tricking
For no treats that ain't for free up on these streets if it ain't Halloween
And why these boppers on my dick, I swear they trying to fuck my whip
Bobbing cause my paint was candy sour apple green
I pull the baddest broads up out they drawers and barely wave
If you ain't winning in this game, then you've barely played
If you ain't buying what you want, then you barely paid
Didn't see me hiding, you can barely hate

Life ain't nothing but an EQ of highs and lows
(And it's okay) An EQ of highs and lows

I got everything you want, everything you need
Damn right, I'm the coldest nigga out, you liable to freeze
Never ever bring your girl around, she liable to leave
She ain't never been around a pimp, she was dying to see
I'm mouthpiece at his prime
The flyest of the freshest that was freshest of the fly
I'm majoring in pimping, I'm just rapping on the side
For the Benz with the trim and the teriyaki tires
And a plane that don't take off if I don't ride
Oh so live, like Pay-Per-View
Let me show you what paper do
Make her pop it and drop it, slide back and forth like a fader do
My bezel is incredible, swear my vessel was hater-proof
Only me, myself and I is who I cater to

Now I was doing it big, all on my own
Gripping wood grain and riding on chrome
Sprinkling game everywhere that I go
Cause all these horny girls want to fuck
Now I was old school riding, slamming my doors
Reclining, shining like a pimp s'posed
Life ain't nothing but an EQ of highs and lows
(And it's okay) An EQ of highs and lows

I'd rather be with you-oo, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you
I'd rather be with you-oo, yeah
Said I'd rather be with you, ooh

Now I was doing it big, all on my own
Gripping wood grain and riding on chrome
Sprinkling game everywhere that I go
Cause all these horny girls want to fuck
Now I was old school riding, slamming my doors
Reclining, shining like a pimp s'posed

M-I crooked now
I never left the crock pot bitch I'm cooking now
Old school ferris wheel rims got me looking down
Country boy making noise world lookie now
Might just throw some D's on it, I got moves to make
On time with these thoroughbreds, my money never late
Don't be bothered with these lames, you should elevate
I got bottles for the poppin' maybe we should celebrate
Money over everything, what'chu know about it?
Bed full of bad bitches, I can’t roll up out it
Playa you should never doubt it
Talking live from the underground
It's forever going down


This that diamond in the back flow
Bitch, I got enough I wish you had mo'
Ho, they used to chuck the deuce and past go
Now, I'm the one you niggas ask foe
I'm talking dirty gutta south
Pimps with the curls and the golds in they mouth
Old school cars, doors on slam
Big country girls, ass like damn (DAMN)
I'm on it now, I been a king
Million Man March in my trunk, you hear the dream (get it shawty)
Cornbread pimpin' throwing collard greens
Poppin my collar feeling clean
Ahh


Twist yo fingers, make a M and throw yo hands up
Twist yo fingers, make a M and throw yo hands up
If you from the south and you proud nigga gon' say it loud
If you a working class nigga or got slugs in yo mouth
From the land of the Ku Klux with no mask
And my folks shit they never had the rebel flags
Still flying 
bitch you lying, if you say we ain't hanging
From a tree Frederick Carter Greenwood Mississippi
Emmett Till til now, how I'mma talk about hoes?
Where Medgar Evers got killed in front his family, body froze
Raynard Johnson, Andre Jones, and my folks in these jail cells
They call it suicide, cause it's just another black male

Rotation,Return of 4Eva,2011,"Old school when I ride, forever sky high
Workin wood wheel, when the sun outside
I’m just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires
Not a care in the world, me and my girl
Candy coated pearl with the bowling ball swirl
I’m just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires

Now this could be one of those days
I chop on my blades, leave my worries behind
Just pretend that I’m paid
Do it big, do it large, on the boulevard
Get a sense of success, pushin' candy cars
I did some thangs for that Chevy mayne
Restored the frame, blew the brains, out on everything
I ain’t ashamed, scooped my dame cause she down to roll
Since way before, don’t touch my screens or my radio (say what?)
She know the score

Old school when I ride, forever sky high
Workin wood wheel, when the sun outside
I’m just rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires, rotating my tires

Now this could be one of those days
Parlay and I ball, turning necks til they break, outside of the mall
Going in going hard like a superstar
Break the bank full tank take me super far
I swang and bang, sittin' heavy mayne
Hoggin' lanes candy paint never leave a stain
Let it rain hydroplane but I'm ridin' slow

The wheels on the slab go round and round, round and round, round and round

They hollerin' bout time, that’s what they told me
You want this money don’t be scared ho show me
Old school, I'm pushin hella flats
I'm workin wheels, crackin seals, breakin pro's backs
Never change, I can't be Hollywood
I'm way too country, plus I'm bumpin' in my neighborhood
5th wheel, comin out hard
Cause all I wanted was some rims on the candy car

Too much to prove, if it ain't money I can't come around
Multi, that's what I'm known for
I'm never comfy, came from nothin bitch I want more
Don't play, you know the score fo'real
I kept it country, and I've been country even with a deal
Still fly, can't keep a player down
Mainstream is cool but in my heart forever underground
Thank god, make due with what I have
I grew up poor, fuck what you heard I ain't goin back

When you go outside don’t let the door slam
Don’t let the door slam x3
When you go outside
(repeat)

Gracious lord I say a prayer for all of mine
Searching for a fixin in these broken times
I let my anger feed my hunger pain
Plotting With my brother from another mother about running things
Another round table mission
Cause rap ain't paying off and ain’t no food in the kitchen
So I am gonna get these p's with the elle with the smell that make the smokers go crazy Can you feel me like braille
Politikn bout a move or two
So we can put on for the city like they used to do
And all them hoes that didn’t call me boo
Or break their backs when they see that boy im cruising through
Cause they respect it when your clockin major figures
Throwing turkeys with the stuffin off of 18 wheelers
Watchin' for the laws with the judges on call
Shuck and jivin to get by with this pistol in my drawers

Time never waits for no man
Peep the slow hand
Lions is all, we rarely know lambs
Get money, split it up with my brohams
When you go outside don’t let the door slam
Don’t let the door slam x3

Now who is that peeking in my window
Music on crescendo
Vibin' to the sounds of the endo
Playin' king kong no nintendo
I can't trust a soul niggas givin up their kin folk
Grandmammas mamma and baby mothers
Grandfathers fathers and baby brothers
Get scared find themselves undercover
You knew the consequences of pushing them junkies hubbas
I tell the story how it be
Don’t bring no dirt in mine
Don’t speak on what you see
Always call before you come
You get jammed you don’t know me
Leave that wire at the door
Wash your hands before you eat
Don’t play the game if it ain’t keeps
Be ready for the finals
Better practice what you preach
You ain't the stand up type then find a seat
Your blood is thicker than water but both them things leak

Time never waits for no man
Peep the slow hand

Get money, split it up with my brohams
When you go outside don’t let the door slam
Don’t let the door slam x3

Them tattletales tell the tales of cars and clothes
Of playa that pose for cameras and shine for hoes
Gleam and glow under strobes of lights in the club
Where drinks is thirty and shots is dubs
And people give kisses and hugs to niggas with plugs
Minus the sink, not talkin bout tubs
Talking about bass, you thinking bout sub
Marine maybe
They other holes in your boat
The people that tell be people you know
The people that hurt be people you owe
Time, now daddy ain't around to hold them down now
For the benz with drawers and rims
Instead of breaking even with odds and ends
You doing 5 to 10 on the late night
For swimming in pools with great whites
They smell that dirty money
No last train to London, or Paris
Life is more then carats and fur coats
On the low that tick tock is worth more

Time never waits for no man

Yeah let my trunk knock till the tape pop
My rims chop chop, while the bass drop
Yeah let my trunk knock till the tape pop
My rims chop chop, while the bass drop

OK I pull up and my partners ask me ""Krizzle where you sub at?
Hey fuck them tweeters they ain’t beaten, get yo sub back""
So I push my pedal to the metal to my cuz house
He owed me money, ""fuck that bread, just set your sub out""
I fly like jets, that candy wet, I'm finna fuck wit hoes
E.q. these settin's in my Chevy 'till my trunk explode
Maybe I'm bumpin', maybe I'm trippin', Maybe I'm feelin' good!
Either way I'm quakin', shakin' wakin' up the folk in my neighborhood
Still hit the scene and whip, pour it up in my cup and sip
Never be where them white folk at cuz the laws over there they bound to trip
Lift it up in my trunk and bump, saw a lame and I hit the trunk
Pop that shit like twice for real, niggas gon' feel my wheels of steel
Chopping these vogues too, congrats when I roll through
Back to the backwood where I ride clean like I'm supposed to
Forever whipping on, leather guts with plenty chrome
Knocking pictures down till I get home

Yeah let my trunk knock till the tape pop
My rims chop chop, while the bass drop

Now usually, I dont disturb the peace
But I'mma wake you if you sleep
With that quake, that bass, that beat
Two miles per hour on creep
Smoke make it hard to see
When I'm swangin' down, I mean bangin' down
I ain't playin' around wit no freaks
I gotta shake junt in my trunk
Tell my DJ bring it back
Turn it up all the way to the max
Till that old school Chevy frame crack
My partner hit me up like he need a ride
But I can't hear him either
Said he got some bags and that's kinda sad
Cause there's only room in here for my speakers
But I'm riding out, like I don't know what he talking bout
Besides he always hating when I'm bassing
Telling me to turn it down
Out of line, and that's outta bounds
Bother me when I'm ridin' 'round
Hell, I just wanna hear the lows, shit
I just wanna shake the ground!
Lay it down in the parking lot
Turn it up outside the club
Can't tell if shawty really digging me
She can shake or she loves the sub
Might be the best but I can dig it though
She vibrate, gyrate
And swear that's the reason I did it for
I put that on my sub

My sub, my sub, my sub, I put that on my sub!
My sub, my sub, I put that on my sub!
My sub, my sub, I put that on my sub!

You gotta get up get out get somethin...

Early morning, kinda sleepy, still yawning
Log on and, dial toning
Forever phoning, for a blessing
Will you help me get my ass up out the bed and go
God love me cause he said it so
Don't look away cause I beg for more
Than I ever ever had
Praying for the future but I'm dealing with the past
Mama say I'm worried cause I'm too much like my dad
Some things are forever, nothing ever last
Like the rising of the sun or when big mama passed
Time travel fast, search and you shall find
Awake from yo slumber, open up yo blinds

Rise and shine!

You gotta get up get out and get something
Why rest when all the world running
RISE AND SHINE!
""If life is a dream why sleep at all""

Don't ever lose sight of your goals just keep straight

The early bird gets the worm, you live and you learn

To who it may concern, ain't much time left
Gotta fight to the death for my family
M.J. baseline they can't handle me
Slam dunk hang time like a canopy
Tired sitting on the couch
Watching celebs pout about the troubles of a million dollar house
So tell 'em I'm out on my grizzly
Put'cha lighters in the air if you feel me
I ain't lying it's the time
To wake up, wipe ya eyes

King’s Blues,Return of 4Eva,2011,"I got no time to waste
I got more bills to pay
I got more mouths to feed now, now, now
I got no time to play
I got no need to stay
When ain't no money around, round, round
What's a king without a crown?
(Time's a wastin')
What's a car without some sound?
(Don't you take your time, young man)

Never been on that silly sucka shit
Rather ride pimped out four-doors
With the wood-grain dashboard, and a rim that sits swole
And the embroidered headrest
Yeah, that be dead fresh
In your ear like headsets
Sleepy eye, forever grind, no bed rest
I can't depend on that next check 'cause it ain't bout shit
The type of broke that got me searching through my mama's couch
For some loose change, got that dollar menu
McDouble, a small fry, lemonade and sweet tea blended
Now here it is Monday, will that get me through 'til Wednesday?
It’ll kill them hunger pains even though it ain't fulfilling
I make do with what God give me, and I take it day by day
I would come by more often, but I can't stay, 'cause...

I got no time to waste
I got more bills to pay
I got more mouths to feed now, now, now
I got no time to play
I got no need to stay
When ain't no money around, round, round
What's a king without a crown?
(Time's a wastin')
What's a car without some sound?
(Don't you take your time, young man)

Try not to step on my toes
Wit' your swole bankrolls you blow and throw
On stripper pole pros you barely know, make it rain
If I was paid with no knowledge or two months late on my mortgage
In the hood that ain't safe, I'd do the same thing
But wishful thinking ain't shit without genius
I can't define how I feel, that's why I'm searching for meaning
No need to pinch me in my player suite, I know when I'm dreaming
My mama tell me 'be careful,' 'cause she know when I'm scheming
Lottery winners don't run in my family
Nor do seven dots when dice starts, so ain't no sense in me gambling
We just crap out
Maybe they'll listen to me, if I pulled the strap out
Like 'give me everything, or I'mma black out', 'cause

I got no time to waste
I got more bills to pay
I got more mouths to feed now, now, now
I got no time to play
I got no need to stay
When ain't no money around, round, round

Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people  say I changed
But if you thinking that you never knew me from the gate man

Ay but fuck it then
Cause I rather ride Bubble Benz and push a bucket break, scrubbing paint
Bubbling up again, on my hood
Gotta get it while the gettin good
A chemist with the pimpin mix the leather with the cherry wood
If you could you should
Slam doors on hoes
I 5th wheel my trunk while white-wallin my vogues
I tight walk on these foes just to flex
Ain't no sense in stepping out if I can't never look my best
Damn, don’t stress my bankroll
Just know I keep my bank swoll
Ain’t no place I can’t go, never trick on no stank ho
It was like that back when I was in my mama’s stomach
A player slid up out the womb and hit the ground running
Never stumbling always gunning like a popped Glock
Keep a hater boxed out
So I could rebound and ball for the top spot
All the same I’m a staple in the game
Ain't never been no lame
That’s why I find it strange when I

Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
But if you thinking that you never knew me from the gate man

Who the fuck are you
Texting me at 1:46 in the evening
Meant the morning, after midnight
While I’m yawning
, you were sleeping
4 door Chevy roll I’m out'chea creeping
Slamming doors in
Heavy things but I want some more
With playa pose, Roll up on hoes
That say they knew me from high-school
Maybe community college, claim they wanna do some thangs
But I can do without it
My mama name ""Such and such"" and we go back like baby powder
Baby I doubt it, it’s hard to swallow
You wanna lay up, I want a dollar
For the machine, I’m kinda thirsty
A little parched, she wanna ride, no you cannot
She say I’m mean I say just the hoes
And dumb niggas, kinda like you
Them B's and doe's
Reject request on Facebook
Daily duckin lames
All you know is my patna; 'em then my name
Plus you heard that I

Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
Made a lot of cheese, people say I changed
But if you thinking that you never knew me from the gate man

You probably see me in the street but nigga you dont know me
Big Sant bitch, motherfucking OG
From the Sip get a grip, wanna visit take a trip
Ain’t a nigga dead or alive that can say that I done flipped
Im from the land of the cheese, home of the slave
Don’t confuse me with no lame
Cause that’s what just I ain’t
Alumni forever put that on the nigga next to me
Started out writing rhymes ended up writing a legacy

They hollerin there he go again
What's his name, where his folk?
Call him Kurt, call him KRIT?
Fuck that nigga I ain’t sure
He got beats, heard him flow
Like a couple years ago
He alright, kinda tight
Shawty like him on the low
There he go, too much soul
I wouldn’t buy it out the store
Plus I saw him in the club
One who hollered at my ho
Just because he got some dough
From a deal he think he ill
I bet thats how that motherfucka feel
And on the real I think he changed",https://genius.com/Big-krit-made-alot-lyrics

Where you've never been before
Come on baby (Come on baby)
Where the players play on, and all that you want's in store
If I had to choose, I'd chose you
Play on player, play on

Fresh linen, purple label it
Don’t know how a horse in here
My closet where the stable at
Immaculately makin' it, takin' trips around the world
Just to find my beauty blindin', over shinin' diamond girl
She in and out of states
Seen a lot of faces worthy of the glance but none is worthy of the chance
To be the queen of all the land as you
What once was a solo mission I planned for two
Do the shit that you can't plan to do
Foreign cars, moon and stars, player exotic beaches
Five star restaurants, cuisines you've never eaten
Dive in your deepest crevice
No resting we barely sleeping
Making my one and only a show as my body is breathing
Never let go, hold 'till you overload
No doubt, you're the highest chick on my totem pole
Cause usually it's playa, playa play on but you can ride
If you know how to stay on, shawty

You're welcome to go
Where you've never been before
Come on baby (Come on baby)
Where the players play on, and all that you want's in store

Play on player, play on

Now don’t go listening to the non believing nay-sayers
I coached the team, 
you get the ring cause you's a team player
Scoring on these hoes in your 
red bottoms
On the runway like a model
Drinkin' Rosay out the bottle
I'm proud, to upgrade you on another level
If God is Aphrodite, we'll argue none better
So pardon, my boast and braggin but I'm feelin like I power ball
Played and won a billion cause I'm here with you
Then we move and make these other hoes invisible
Always bankin, so correct with your residuals
And when our bodies intertwine, it's so spiritual
I'm Nat King Cole with the stroke -- Unforgettable
Lay back, let your hair down (hair down)
Drop the top, roll a doobie up, shawty be one with the air now
Cause usually it's playa, playa play on but you can fly
If you know how to hang on (shawty)

You're welcome to go

Till she shook and went to sleep

She suckin', she fuckin' 'cause she love the way I spit it
I know she only want me for my dick but I can dig it
I dig her, there's nothing iller

For chickens with cruel intentions of layin' eggs to get to my paper
Plenty pimpin nah I ain’t trickin
Ain't never slippin’, hella liffted when we piffin
Stuck to the cellin', you smell the vapors when we roll by
So crack a seal pour up and get right...

Ok, this is just an anthem for tha playas
Top notch boppers, and the pimp's with tha gators, rollerskaters smoked out elevators
Drinks sippin', paint flippin' congregators
Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right
All night, all night, all night
Party like it’s 1999

Back up, back up, cause it’s on
Break of dawn, poppin' tops, takin' shots, vibin' to the early morn’
I ain’t trippin if I make it home, tryin’ to bone
Taking pictures of bad bitches and save em in my phone
BBM in me on the late night, take flight, on my base pipes
Searchin' for jaws like great whites
Ain't that some shit? yeah, thats some shit
You claimed that was your girl but why she all up on my tip?
Don’t need to buck cause you get fucked up in this party
Chickitty check your self before I finish what you started
Get retarded hella stupid in the mix line up
Knock em down dominoes in this bitch
Drink ain’t free, drink on me
Store run gotta take my whip cause your tanks on E?
Its all good
I got a little doe to blow, buy a case of Ole E' and some blunts to roll

Ok, this is just an anthem for tha playas
Top notch boppers, and the pimp's with tha gators, rollerskaters smoked out elevators
Drinks sippin', paint flippin' congregators
Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right
All night, all night, all night
Party like it’s 1999

Feelin good, drink got me feelin' fine
Doing what a playa does, smokin' just to ease my mind
Foreva gettin on, ridin' chrome, poppin ass pros won't leave it alone
I said these poppin ass pros won't leave it alone
All day, all night I can’t be faded
Too cold on hoes they ain’t for savin
Get right, get throwed, feel like we’ve made it
How could you hate? congratulate

Ok, this is just an anthem for tha playas
Top notch boppers, and the pimp's with tha gators, rollerskaters smoked out elevators

R4 Intro,Return of 4Eva,2011,"Hey hey now
Hey man, it's always good to see you my brother
Good to see all of y'all
Yeah, I called this meeting today to discuss a matter at hand
There’s a movement we got going on
I know a lot of yall may have heard of it
It's called the R4, or return of 4eva
And you know, it’s not easy to talk about it
If you can dig it, but if you just check you might catch my drift

It’s when the lights get dim and the people get quiet
Wilding waiting on change
People standing in line for hours at a time
Just to see you hit the stage
You got a feeling that you never really felt before
Deep down in ya gut
That’s when the DJ hit the replay in the track
Just to make em turn it up
Now the crowd starts chanting everybody frantic
Ya know that ya runnin behind
The promotor sold way too many tickets for the venue
He might just shut it down
So they so they rush backstage like
You gotta go on, you gotta go right now
And you pass your drank to the broad with the dank
Like baby girl hold that down
Then they hand you a mic that’s all you need
Peek out the curtain now you see
Wave of people screamin, eager
To tell them a story that will set them free
Let them be a new generation of rebels
And that there my friend, is how you begin
The return of 4eva
 (Big Sant)
*alarm goes off*
Ayo, Krit!
Ay, cuz!
Man, cut that fucking alarm off cuz!
It's too fucking early in the morning for that shit!
Get up! Goddamn!",https://genius.com/Big-krit-r4-intro-lyrics
Shake It,Return of 4Eva,2011,"Yeah, broadcasting to ya live from the third coast
I'm ready

Let me take you higher-a-a-a-ohh
Let me light your fire-a-a-a-ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Won't you shake it baby, shake it baby
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it?
Can you take it baby, take it baby
Take it baby, take it baby, take it?

Now I was creeping across slow, in a candy '84
With the fifth wheel and a chandelier, and the elbows with Vogues
I was scooping up yellow, head game nothing better
She was down with the King, ironically her first name Coretta
Her body is stellar, I told her that when I first saw her
In the strip club with her top off and her ass up like ""Good Lord""
She had me pinned up in a corner
Whispering that I could have her if I want her

Let me take you higher-a-a-a-ohh
Let me light your fire-a-a-a-ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Won't you shake it baby, shake it baby
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it?
Can you take it baby, take it baby
Take it baby, take it baby, take it?

Now I was late night creeping on 'em in the bed that they was sleeping on
And her man, she was cheating on him for the chrome wheels that glide
On the old school with the plush seats that feel extra soft when you touch these
She'd get real freaky, wanna touch me and suck me as I drive
I said cool, she was thorough with it, matter of fact, she was thoroughbred
As the light from the street twinkle off my chrome and the back of her silky head
Kinda crazy, trying not to crash my whip, but I'm kinda hazy
Kinda soaring, kinda high, told her one more time

Let me take you higher-a-a-a-ohh
Let me light your fire-a-a-a-ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Won't you shake it baby, shake it baby
Shake it baby, shake it baby, shake it?
Can you take it baby, take it baby
Take it baby, take it baby, take it?

Won't you ride aboard my spaceship?
Can't you tell we going places?

""I definitely don't like what's happening to you""
""Now just because I got a little bit of cash
Why does everybody gotta start bugging?""",https://genius.com/Big-krit-shake-it-lyrics
XXL Freshman Freestyle: Big K.R.I.T.,UnKnown,2011,"I told them call me KRIT, they told me change my name
Don’t be alarmed if you don’t make it, thats just part of the game
Besides I ain't rapping about dope nor did I sell it
I guess the story of a country boy just ain't compelling
A&R’s searching for a hit, I just need a meal
Couldn’t afford to pay the rent, but passed up on the deal
Cause, it wasn’t right sometimes you gotta wade the storm
In a class of my own, but I was scared to raise my arm
Like, this my dream, this my life, I sacrificed it all
Except my soul in the firm belief there is a God
Watching out, when all the others used to doubt
Felt my pain and pointed down and said “Son, your time is now”
I think my grandma pulled some strings on the low
Thats between her and the lord I’ll never know
For those that caught me in the Spin, in Complex magazine, XXL, the Vibe and whatever inbetween
It’s safe to say that dreams come true I guess
Don’t let nobody tell ya, try for yourself
Just know that I was considered just a dreamer
But I paid my dues and turned so many doubters to believers

Red Eye,4eva N a Day,2012,"I'm trying to find out what's going on with our relationship, why am I the only one that's always calling, making an effort? I understand that you're busy on the road, you have to do what you have to do for your career, but I feel like if you really want this relationship, you do what you have to do for us also. Like I'm always, always the one doing everything, and I'm just tired like... call me back baby

I'm like what happened to us, maybe I'm rapping too much
I been missing your touch, sometimes I'm out and I lust
What if love ain't enough, and all we have is this trust
What if I'm fucking that up, so you don't trust in me much
I'm wasting your time, to say I'm straight, I'd be lying
It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind
I'd throw you a line, I'd give you a sign
Right now I'm through with the trying, I think you ready to fly
I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress
I go through the motions pretending I'm at my best
Fall victim to flesh, I live to be fresh
But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck
I run out of breath cause I ain't taking the steps
Money comes and it goes 'til family's all I got left
I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself
You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly
I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks
I'm doing the norm and not what it takes
I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes
'Til we forget about us and what we have is too late
I know in your heart, you ain't conditioned to race
So I steady the wheel, forever pumping the brakes
Resort to the bottle, that's how I deal with the shakes
Pray for these haters, that's how I deal with the hate
Look to the sky, don't be content with the now
You ain't concerned with the why, you just wanna know how
I didn't give it a chance, when you just wanna be down
And save me from myself, but I'm wanting to drown
King is much more than the weight of a crown
As good as it feels, that ain't the way that it sounds
Being single is cool 'til ain't nobody around
Then I'm chasing you down, cause you was ready to fly
I can't be what you want me to be
You're shooting too high cause you ain't aiming at me
One minute you're calling out for the D
Then the next minute you wanna be free
Then the next minute you hollering out peace
Although I know it's a war and there'll be blood in the street
If you call don't be frustrated at me
Just leave you're heart at the beep, cause mine is harder to reach
Cause mine is harder to see
And that don't make it harder to cheat
Being friends would make it harder to breathe
So if you ready to fly, just forget about me
But if you willing to try then I'm willing to leap
Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet
I ain't the man you want me to be
I guess that's what's been bothering me",https://genius.com/Big-krit-red-eye-lyrics
Boobie Miles,4eva N a Day,2012,"Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

Ain't nothing for free so get yo' ass up
My partner scared if we don’t speed then they might pass us
So we hit 85, tryna keep this dream alive
All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushin'
Bop a darling in my bucket 'til their heads catch concussions
But please don’t push my buttons, I don’t know you like that
Can't do no favors for these haters, I don’t owe you like that
Well, I guess it’s the allure like when you need to score
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Hit or miss, we take the risk
Cause anything is better than Viennas and warm grits
Trading bust-it-babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
Yeah, she's a gold digger but that pussy good
So what the fuck, don’t be late for this player's ball
Hurry up and...

Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

They told me life is what you make it
So what you been creating on your free time?
I’ll lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason
Some people change, it’s a part of life like seasons
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
They’ll be gone with the wind once your jump shot don’t go in
Or your ACL torn and you're a couple yards short
From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down four
Gotta play the field, be willing to ride, willing to dive
For what you desire, call your pop fly, but never collide
With other players that play the game
Don’t be eager to run with crowds, stay in your lane
Pass this knowledge on to your team, but carry the flame
Cause it's yours and yours alone to brighten your way
Put God first and free your soul
Cause even Olympic runners sometimes lose their gold
So...

Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins",https://genius.com/Big-krit-boobie-miles-lyrics

And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out

Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' on the go
Holler at my partner for some drank that I could pour
Sippin', candy dripping while I'm tippin' on them vogues
Horizontal sideways trunk might explode
Headed to the spot where the strippers show me love
Cause they got them fire wings and I love to grub
Trying to get my mind off my bitch back at home
Searching for a freaky bopper dying to turn me on

Gotta play it safe drop my bait while she bite
She sucking and she fucking well, that's just my type
It's something about that pussy when it's gushy under lights
She claims she knows my name and she seen me out in public
Finally got the nerve to speak to me cause she been crushin'
Agreeing in whatever that I tell her she'll bust it
I showed her what I'm bout and turned her out soon as I touched it

Stock legs, corn bread fed, she a stallion
Drank in my tank turn me up to a thousand
Crank it to the max while she shake it from the back
Claiming that she dyin' I'mma hit her with this 'Lac
Told her turn around and scrub the ground to the beat
Set that ass on my lap and whisper this to me

Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin'

Wake Up,4eva N a Day,2012,"(Wake up, Wake up
Wake up, Wake up)

Thank God for the day, thank God for the morning
Won't take this here for granted, no good Lord I gots to get on it
With every breath I take, or move I make, I gots to keep wanting
A better life for me, and all of mine, no time for that yawning
In the bed waiting, procrastinating, I gots to be hungry
Too old for games that don't mean a thing, can't play with my homies
Just know I'm paying dues if I don't pick up for ya, whenever you phone me
Cause being broke ain't fun and that pity party I threw is starting to get boring
Good morning

I know today gonna be the best day of my life
(Wake up, wake up)
My life
(Wake up, wake up)
I know today gonna be the best day of my life
(Wake up, wake up)
Gotta keep my head out the clouds and my feet on the ground
(Wake up, wake up)

Gotta be realistic, stop talking and listen
Cause at the blink of an eye your life'll pass you by, good Lord you missed it
Now, you're wishing that you went slow, took advantage of that 2-4
Yeah you gave your all to get your back from off the wall but you can give more
Stand tall against the grain, be yourself, don't do the same
As the next man cause all paths are different, so don't jump the train
Hell, we can't complain, for this borrowed time
So don't misuse yours, cause you can't borrow mine
Good morning

I know today gonna be the best day of my life

Early morning, whipping up breakfast
So unexpected, I'm barely yawning
Iron my school clothes, food up on the stove
Biscuits was hella fluffy, ""Grandma, I need two of those""
You whisper ""Wait for my brother,"" papa do what you say
'Fore a crumb could hit my tongue, tell me to pray
Scrape my plate, wash the dish
Be prepared for the world and be thankful of the time that I get
To be young on the run
Don't be eager to be grown, have some fun
You'll look back when you turn 21
Like ""My, time flies""
Wishing you were you here by my side

I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday

But I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday

And they tell me just to pray

Like an autumn breeze, knocking all the pecans out the trees
Baking your fruitcakes for Christmas Eve
The smell of sweet potato pie make it hard to leave
Sit and reminisce, out the grab bag, everybody got a gift
Just be thankful for the the thought, don't be giving lip
We laugh and cry
You knew you couldn't save the world but you had to try
I been doing the same
Just so you know, your lectures ain't going in vain
Accepted that you're gone but I deal with the pain
Whether the rain, just know I won't be the same

Cause I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
I miss you like yesterday
Yeah, I know it sound cliché
And they tell me just to pray

Plus I rolled up some of that... ummph!
Sticky-icky, sour, Jolly Rancher candy
Make the bottom of my cup sweet as your punani
Well I'm just joking shawty
I talk about pussy a lot and getting money when I get unfocused shawty
Cause I'm dealing with the pain of the game
And it's getting harder to keep coping shawty
Cause I can't set the world and I showed that, so I hold back
For doing what I can to be a better man forgetting you know that

Them doubters and them non-believers that said I wouldn't
And them A&Rs when I spit them bars that said I couldn't
And them bourgie broads that wasn't fucking when I was broke
Now they squeeze by to the V-I so I can jump down they throat
I put it on the line and do what I love and above all have hope
That it was meant for me and it was meant to be then it'll pay off like it's s'posed

If you ain't 'bout your own people, what you gon' raise your fists for?
Old school with them kickers, like karate feet, my money stretch like Pilates be
If you never been to the top it's something that you gotta see
Somewhere that you gotta be, I never dealt with the lames
Knock on wood but I'm hella good in this candy paint
No time to waste, keep my pace, forever still
Worry about you and how you live, I did it big, I hurt they feelings

Record breakers that did mad favors when they knew no one ever heard about us
And them playa pimps, Chevy donks that crank the thump 'til the trunk beat
Cross love from a bad broad that jump in cause she fuck with me
In the hood selling CDs cause they showed love at the Mom & Pops
'Til I sold em all even when my buzz was small and still chose to cop
Fact remains that I’m still the same and I’ll never change or settle
Cause I ain't tripping on mainstream cause love from the underground, that's forever
Now, that's forever

I'd rather sit higher than bald eagles on shoulders of giant people
If I'm gon' ride, hell, I don't know about them
Popping my collar, rocking gators, fuck some Prada
Be a scholar of this pimpin' to the very, very end
Forever official like words out the scripture
Off the Richter, saw my future through my rear-view lens
Just me and my old school

Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
If you ride old, ride slow, ride old, ride slow
Ride old, ride slow, slamming, slamming these doors

See it ain't just a car
It ain't just a whip
It's a time machine
It's a spaceship
It's precious
You gotta take your time, you can't be
Rubbing on them curbs and hitting them potholes
You gotta ride clean and ride slow
Me and my old school

Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow
Candy, candy paint, slamming these doors
Ride, ride, ride clean if you, if you ride old, ride slow

Down & Out,4eva N a Day,2012,"Good Lord we back one mo' 'gin
This for the people, this for the have-nots..
I know what you going through
I know what you dealing with on the daily, you feel me?
Ain't nothing but sunshine from here..
Let's get high

Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain
Lord, I wish it would
Smoking all this weed don't make me sane
But it should
In a world that's down and out
In a world that's down and out

I got my back against the wall
Once again, I've been cornered
Smoke that roach from my ash tray
From the other day and down this last Corona
That I scrape for, gotta make more
Gotta get mine cause when I get time
I'mma get shine and clear my runway
And wait 'til I get signed
To stretch my wings and fly
Do what I gotta do to get by
See the world through my third eye
Would answer the things I worried about
At the end of days, bills to pay
If it's a white man's world, am I still a slave
To the minimum wage?
Keep words minimal, subliminal
Y'all won't make it anyway
Out the traps they set
Follow them tracks they left to the White House
And tell Oprah Winfrey I don't need no chicken
Bitch is gonna turn my lights out
On a daily basis
Piece of American Pie they cut me, I can barely taste it
But I know it ain't 'bout shit cause my grandma ain't make it

Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain
Lord, I wish it would
Smoking all this weed don't make me sane
But it should
In a world that's down and out
In a world that's down and out

Can't take that for granted though
I'm still searching for antidotes
Niggas outchea sick from the money they spent
Trying to get more cars and clothes and hoes
That really know they poles, is that on earth winning y'all?
Is every woman in a sundress, really down for the cause?
I can't be sure, nowadays everybody 'bout dough
About the play, a queen to be? A gold digger? I can't even say
But either way I strap up, wrap up
Cause I don't want no capsules after
A rock-a-bye that I deny cause she stay on heads like tassels
And that's not to say ain't no queens around my way
I seen one the other day, but she had bruises on her face
And cried to me that men ain't shit and she fed up
They only want her with her legs up
Even though her nose swollen and eye was closed
I told her keep her head up

Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain
Lord, I wish it would
Smoking all this weed don't make me sane
But it should
In a world that's down and out
In a world that's down and out",https://genius.com/Big-krit-down-and-out-lyrics
Handwriting,4eva N a Day,2012,"(Handwriting's on the wall)
Yeah, it's on the wall
I'mma keep drinking til they toss me out this motherfucker man

Excuse my tone of voice but today was just a bad day
Label hit me about another single and said I ain't had play
Since Country Shit, hell they thought that was a regional record anyway
But thank God for Bun B and Ludacris because they had faith
That shit would take off and it did, guess I was too country to quit
I make albums not hits, these rich folks don't know about this
But that's cool, I'm back to that K.R.I.T. Wuz Here
Pray to God this was meant for me, a king to be
Hoping my time was near
Maybe I'm rapping in vain, maybe this wasn't my lane
Maybe I'm hurting myself, talking 'bout real life instead of the fame
How can I change? Shawty I swear I think I'm wasting time
On the phone with my pops like, ""I just wanna save some lives""
I just wanna do some right with the wrongs I was dealt
My pride might be my downfall, but I ain't asking for help
I wear my heart on my sleeve, don't run into me cause it bleeds
No disrespect to your craft, but I make my own beats
Shit the handwriting..

(The handwriting's on the wall...)
Man the Hennessy do something to a nigga man sometimes that shit...
I just can't hold back, you feel me?

First quarter got me like boiling water with soda in it
Drop my project in the pot watch it lock up like those in prison
Gotta prove these people wrong that don't see the vision
Three nominations, number one on 106, hell I forgot to mention
Two free albums minus label support
Fired my publicist cause I forgot what I was paying him for
Drunk til I'm barely conscious, call Jonny tell him put Sha on 3-way immediately
Cause I'm sick of being lied to and I'm waging war
Then I'm going back to Sippi-land and I'm quitting rap
Ain't that bad cause when I was poor, hell I was fairly happy
Dealing with the critics and the comments got me trippin'
Like my accent and my tone make it really hard to listen
I was scarred but I was driven before the politics came
Lynching rappers and dropping albums, and watching 'em hang
I pushed mine back with fear that they might just do me the same
Cause I rebel I might get shelved, but that's part of the game
Hell, the handwriting...

(The handwriting's on the wall...)
Goddamn right it's on the wall
I take this shit seriously man
This is my life, this all I've ever known
This all I'll ever do and I promise to God I won't let nobody take it from me

I did it for all of mine and all of yours
Ten toes deep in the game I'm in
I'm bound to lose if I'm living in sin
If I play to win will I make it out?
I'm tired of feeling my heart Lord I just wanna scrape it out
This the road less traveled, shit I just gotta stay the route
I hear the hate and all the betrayal I just gotta phase it out
With another shot, better chase it down with a glass of Crown
Put that on my tab, yeah I'm doing bad
Cuz music's all I've ever known, shit, all I've ever had
Tryna say something, tryna do something, tryna be better
Ain't much time left, I gotta make do, I can't live forever
Ain't that what makes me me? No smoke and no mirrors
And I don't even wear Loc's, so they can see me clear
And you can say that I'm bitter but tell me if I'm trippin'
They stick their noses up and talk down on Mississippi
Imagine how you'd feel to know you work hard, and you educated
And they treat you like you never made it
The handwriting...

(The handwriting's on the wall, final curtain's about to fall
Just ain't no feelings left at all, the handwriting, handwriting's on the wall)",https://genius.com/Big-krit-handwriting-lyrics
Package Store,4eva N a Day,2012,"Just the other day when I was out at the store
Saw a preacher hella creepin', trying to bang on a ho
That same motherfucker used to bang on my door
Hollering 'bout donations for cause, 'cause collections is low
Damn shame, but I got change, so I give to the plate
He know I know he buying pussy, he don't lie to my face
Said that I should cut my grass cause I'm surrounded by snakes
Not sure if that was metaphoric or if he had seen one today
I know what he said but maybe I beg to differ
The only souls you like to touch were the legs of strippers
The only reason I know that cause I used to tip 'em
How could I judge when in this world we both some niggas
And we both some killers, and we both some thieves
Only God can save us all what he spoke to me
What he hoped to be was a better man in due time
But he fell short tryna sip on the wine

In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your woes you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
Which flavors of life's labor have you had?
In the neighborhood package store
Don't need directions for the gun shop, it's on the same block
Of the neighborhood package store

Click clack 'gainst my head went the Glock
From a hoodlum on the block
Whispered to me ""What you got?
You'll get shot if you refuse to come up off that
What made you floss that outside the package store?
You know we out here like wolves searching for antelope
Lambs, and sheep, prey on weak
Don't you reach under your seat, I'll bust your head like cantaloupe""
Then I replied - out for a nightcap
Didn't bring my tool with me cause I assumed that I'd be right back
Shawty said the neighborhood was cool and it wasn't like that
But here you are with a loaded gun and I'll be damned if I'm gon' fight back""
So he went on to loosen up on the aggression
And proceed to lecture me on the troubles of recession
And ain't that many jobs outchea hiring convicted felons
So instead of buying what he want, he taking what they selling
Then bailing into the darkness, forever on the grind
Addicted to the feeling of wine

In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your woes you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
Which flavors of life's labor have you had?
In the neighborhood package store
Don't need directions for the gun shop, it's on the same block
Of the neighborhood package store

Gripping Golden Grain, flying like Thunderbirds
Easy, Jesus, watch your Crown while I swang and swerve
Molotov bottle, alcohol, not a Tylenol
Could remove the kind of headache that a fault could cause in the streets
Don Julio my peeps
Cuervo, chasing hoes, Captain Morgan with my feet
Standing tall on 'em, 'til I rendezvous with Grey Goose
Cool gray, salty taste, almost threw up on my shoes
Hypnotiq blues, Bloody Mary red
Codeine purple seem to take me to the edge
One more shot all I need just to hit the ledge
Toss and turn, crash and burn, just to crawl up in my bed
Going to my head, seeing circles lately
Tasting cream daily, I don't mean Bailey
Vodka tried to kill me, but Seagram Gin saved me
Been a customer so why they play me

In the neighborhood package store
Get some wine for spirits
Some gossip for your mind if you down to hear it
In the neighborhood package store
Silver and gold for the low
And some papers for your woes you can roll
In the neighborhood package store
Mixing the good with the bad
Which flavors of life's labor have you had?

The Alarm,4eva N a Day,2012,"(Do you believe) they could call you the greatest
So you pay your bills but you barely made it
(Do you believe) that it's all on your shoulders
And everything would seem clear if you stayed sober
(Do you believe) that your heart is really in it
When you know most these folks ain’t impressed with your vision
(Do you believe) that this pep talk
Will keep you in top form when so many fell off
(Do you believe) that the world feels your pain
It's kill or be killed, can you keep what you claimed
(Do you believe) that you really can sustain
This lifestyle, Sky Miles, ballin' in the chains
(Do you believe) that these niggas really fuck with you
When you hit rock bottom, look how many stuck with you
(Do you believe) that the devil's all around
If he knocking at your door, have strength to turn him down
(Do you believe) they can barely hear the real shit
In a world of fantasies, can you be a realist
(Do you believe) that the governments concealing
Their true intentions, apprehending those that won't be pillaged
(Do you believe) that doin' right will make you richer
And just because you paid these White folks still won't call you nigga
(Do you believe) that you can sacrifice it all
When the ball's in your court and your time has been called
(Do you believe) that God will forgive you
For those times that you didn’t let Him steer you
For those times that you up and lost faith
Cause you swore He couldn’t hear you and nothing ever changed
(Do you believe) that screamin' out His name
When you lost your best friend is what really helped the pain
(Do you believe) that you never loved fame
And you wouldn’t miss a dime if you lost it all today

Country Rap Tunes,4eva N a Day,2012,"This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk

Back on my grind again, wasting no time again
Putting it on the line, been losing, I'm tryna win
Whenever, right now is the better
Hoping all those stars and planets align together
Tryna weather the storm, go beyond and gone
Find all of life's treasures and bring 'em to my home
Like, like we made it Sippi-land, country and all of that
Tell all them haters congratulate us or fall back
Cause I'm in my old school, traveling to the A
Don't worry, little baby brother, I'll be back like any day
Spread the word, I flip verbs like birds
Get flipped by dope boys that park rims on the curb
Got my CD in they deck, bop they heads, break they neck
Whispering that I got next to execs
That never heard of Mississippi lyricists
Not even visionaries envision this

Leave it behind, the, the, the crime
Fighting for every yard across the poverty line
Any given Sunday could be my last
Pay my tithes with the gas money or let the plate pass
Cause God can understand the lows
The feeling of being stranded on the side of the road
Watching all the fancy cars come and go
Like it couldn't get no worse, but it storms some more
Cause whenever it rains, little buddy, it pours
When you need the sunshine like the most
But even a magnolia fights to grow
Under certain circumstances similar to yours
I just wanna be heavenly, I suppose
Cause success never, ever save your soul
I came from the bottom of the map to show
The world that it's more to us country folk

This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is

Lifting burdens, being worried 'til I pass out
Jumping hurdles, running laps just for scraps in this rat race

Caught a sprain, ice buckets by my bed now
Felt a impact like a truck hit me full contact
No pads, Lord come get me, I'm down
I can feel it in my soul
This my last chance to shine but they know I'm getting old
Hard to move on, my legs ain't been the same
Since I took a fall from greatness
Now I knowing when it rains on my homecoming
See my folks ?
I'm the GOAT, but I really need to hold something
One more dime, I'll be fine, yea I'm the best in my prime
But what about now


On the second set, got to do this for myself
When the balls in my court, can't depend on no one else
This a long shot, but I trained all my life
Broke some bone, cried some tears just so I could get it right
When it's time, hit the gym trying to win
On the off-season doing what I can, but I'm running out of time
Got a partner going through it
Cause his bills still due and he ain't started since the moment that he signed
Physical training and all
Rehabilitation the cause of shookin' jivin', no hard turf
Ain't no complaining at all when they overturnin' your call

Hogging lanes, swang and bang in a 'Stang so let me by

Money on the floor
Lighters on the dresser
Drop my top, no one can do it better
Diamonds and the leather
Wood and the chrome
Bopping ass hoes just won't leave me alone

She call me big baby, I got my Guccis on
Black on black, head to toe, smelling like Prada cologne
Feeling like big pimping
, inhale, exhale
Good green, thick lean, give them bitches x pills
Cocaine make them get so loose on them tequila shots
Every time I do it I regret it, the bitch just can't stop
Now she's dancing on the table, skirt done went up to her navel
Niggas throwing money at her, shit I can't be mad at her

You bring the girl to me then I'mma bless her, test her

Went to jail and shared a cell with a 25-to-lifer
Stayed at my grandma house with 25 bibles
Stayed in the trap house with like 25 rifles
Drop my top and I dip dip dip
But if I pop my trunk you better duck, don't slip
Chrome lips on the vehicle look like they blowing kisses
Reel them hoes in, it look like I'm going fishing
Okay this how I ride, two bad hoes inside
One ho say she ready, the other ho said she tired
I'mma drop this other ho off, me and the other ho we gon ride

"Rich Dad, Poor Dad",Live from the Underground,2012,"Remember a child's place is what I often heard while asking
About the things no adolescent could imagine
Trying on the pants of a man I had not yet become
Hands too small to button the buttons my father often fastened
While speaking on his dreams and ambitions
Although I could never understand
There was comfort that I listened, with mention to be better than him

Be a better man in a world of negligence
Pedophilic meddling, son don't trust your reverend
When they settling for settlements
Lock your doors, shut your windows, don't let the devil in
The media graffiti us with relishments
Money, cars, and clothes I suppose what successful is
They say sow you're oats, it's natural to experiment
But don't get sucked and fuck and run amok - be celibate
Only 14 when I first cut
I wasn't her first, I had to strap up
And thank God for them condoms that my papa gave me
Cause a convo 'bout birds and bees wouldn't save me
From a child I couldn't shoulder, pushin' in a stroller
Down the streets of 3OB while all my homies asked to hold 'em
Proceed to play ball, when he cried I can't console him
I truly wasn't ready for kids, that's what he told me

I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad
I had a rich dad, poor dad

Never in a sense of money spent
Christmas trees are beautiful without presents up under them
Lead by example, don't get caught up in the rapture
Life is just a raffle, mostly pain, but some laughter
The older that you get, it's even harder to believe
No superheroes on TV you used to see
Remember that I told you slow down, control your speed
The more you walk with God, the harder it is to scrape your knee
I remember when I fell from my first bike
There were no ""are you okays"" and rarely ""are you alrights""
Just dirt in my pockets, handful of gravel
That's when I realized that getting up is only half the battle
The fear of falling off will haunt me well into my teens
The moment that the world took a shit upon my dreams
Cause money is the root, and love is all we had
In fact, I'm glad, I had a rich dad, poor dad",https://genius.com/Big-krit-rich-dad-poor-dad-lyrics

Bout time niggas seen the real
Old school car with the grill
'Ghini doors, valet can't help you up out it
Top fell off and ain't shit I can do about it
Ride clean, every day's a holiday
Gettin paid, every day's a bottle day
And you ain't seen a pimp until you seen me on the corner
Last time your bitch chose me but I ain't want her
Get money, motherfuck fame
Tryna break a ho and make change
If you knew me from the ribbit then you knew that I was tippin
You's a motherfuckin liar if I ain't reppin' Mississippi
What you know about it
Krizzle still cold on em
My gift of gab came with a bow on it
So if you grind and you down for the smashing
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean

What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty

Don't be pushin on my buttons
Wait a minute motherfucker

Don't you wanna rest off in this glass house
If I let you ride set that ass out
Don't play me like no trick that's just so overrated
All this superbassin' woofer quakin' got you motivated
Haters screamin favors never stopped me
Sucker motherfuckers never blocked me
Poppin trunk, droppin top as I beat the bass
If you don't know what KRIT mean by now then bitch you super late
Po' another fo' up to recuperate
If pimpin was a blood sport I kick it like a kumate
Working boppers on the field like it's 2 a day
Three a day, 4 a day, any day a pro say
Shake it for a player, let me see it
If you lookin' for a southern country bumpkin let me be it
You say you ridin' and you down for the smashin
So what you mean, what you mean, what you mean

What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came

Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't be pushin on my buttons
Wait a minute motherfucker

I knew a bitch named Mandy
She was a pink toe
She had a lisp so I asked her could she deepthroat
She said she never done it, she said she never tried
She sittin' there tellin' a motherfuckin lie
I said baby don't you worry just get down on your knees
Cause some warm head will turn me up a couple degrees
So just throw your lips around this anaconda and squeeze
And you'll keep a nigga harder than some government cheese
I say all women are freaks they just need an excuse
Pretendin' they all tight when these bitches is loose
That's why I stay strapped up when I'm knocking the boots
And love that military pussy I just need some recruits (Troops!)
Salute a pimp, it's Luda pimp
Bad bitches join my team, ugly hoes exempt
After midnight don't play no motherfucking games
Cause if you do, all you gon' hear me say

What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't you see the grill
Candy on the frame
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Why the fuck you came
Why, Why the fuck you came
What you mean you ain't nasty
Why the fuck you came
Don't be pushin on my buttons

I got shows, getting money I can barely fold
Cause that's what I do
And ain't nobody gon' pimp K-R-I-T
Yea, that's how I feel
And them diamonds niggas always rhyming 'bout
Pressed against my wheel
And ain't nobody gon' check none of me or mine
In God I trust
If you think I'm out here tricking these hoes
You got me fucked up
And ain't no playing in the south, turn a bad bitch out
When I grab my pipes
Y'all niggas think this shit came oh so easy
It wasn't over night, but

Ever since I blew
Don’t be worryin' bout me an don’t worry bout mine, player
Worry about you
And ain't nobody gon' block my shine today
With the roof gone
I got a top notch bitch, you need something like this
But you gotta get your own
And ain't nobody gon' wreck this hard
When I'm traveling down the boulevard
Now they hollering out ""Oh my God!""
Cause they never seen rims this large
""That's country shit""
Well that's cool cause I'm country, bitch
I never turn my back, I burn on wax
And stack my cash 'til I'm country rich, cause

Chevys on that chrome
Live and in my zone
'Til a player gone
I got this here, I got this here
Doing it how I feel
Doors open for hoes
Haters in my grill
I got this here, I got this here
Diamond in the back
Slamming on these doors
Trunk beat 'til it crack
I got this here, I got this here
Get it how I live
Smoking on that good
Cracking on my seal

Cool 2 Be Southern,Live from the Underground,2012,"We make it cool to be southern

Okay I'm straight up off my grandmama porch
Hollywood neva, I took the southernized approach
Collard green pockets but I southern fried the flow
Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw
Mason jar drank shit, keep the dank lit
We swang whips old schools like my paw-paw
You can't get
Now which motherfuckers said that we can't pimp?
I hit ditches like switches, before the paint flip
I can't be faded
The heart of king born in the 1980's
For real, you never see a nigga like me lately
Debonair, never scared, Fred Astaire when I carry a cadence
Refrain for being lame, ho
I got a surefire way to give the game what it came for
A third coast nigga still bustin, stop frontin' motherfucker

We make it cool to be southern
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
We make it cool to be southern
Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid
We make it cool to be southern
Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana
We make it cool to be southern
Return of 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say
We make it cool to be southern

Let me take you down this country road
Country flow, country foe, country fire
24's on the Caddy, type savvy
My player ways never fade, I got 'em from my grand daddy
Old school, so smooth
The type of fresh that you can comb through
Or you can cut it with a butter knife
And spread it on the brain of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Off top my drop, rims chop, no cops, drink pop
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
Green lit, grain grip, bad bitch on my tip
And when she tell me, lord knows she don't mean it
I been this way since I was knee high
To a grasshopper gettin' money in my Levis
I mean my genes, Pine-Sol clean
Bird's eye view with my frame on lean

We make it cool to be southern
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
We make it cool to be southern
Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid
We make it cool to be southern
Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana

Get down, get down, get down with it

Praying Man,Live from the Underground,2012,"Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
A praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming

Stumble along the path, he emerged from the grass
Stopped at me and asked why so sad
Perhaps because they had taken what I had
I'm sure it wasn't much to them but it was all that I could grab
I was on my way to church, I was running late at first
But after all this riff raff here, I missed service and it hurts
But what's worse I'm not sure how long I've been swaying in the breeze
Tired of talking to the trees and you the first praying man that I've seen
I figured you'd lend a hand, but I see if you got some time
I'm glad you looked up because most people pay no mind
He smiled and said ""Son well, I can do you one better""
He removed a pocket knife and cut me down from my oppressor, forever

Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
A praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming

Boating along the sea, he emerged from the mist
Asked me how I got far from the beach
Cause they stripped me of my pride and put these shackles on my feet
I was stacked on top of my folk and it was really hard to breathe
It was a little hard to believe that I had been caught up in this mess
And some of my own people would sell me to my death
It was a lot of us on the ride and it was a lot of us that was lost
But some of us couldn't take it so some of us jumped off
And I'm really glad you found me on your course
I been out here for a while and there's no sign of the shore
He smiled and said ""Son well I can do you one better""
He lended me his hand and picked me up from my oppressor, forever

Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
A praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming

Driving along the road
He asked me what I was running from and where I was trying to go
""Well I was working in the field and one of my kinfolk just got killed
And I knew they'd come for me and Lord knows I wanna live
See I heard there's people free, not that far but far from me
To be running from these dogs with no shoes up on my feet
I heard of this railroad that ventures underground
And takes my kind of people to a place that we can't be found
And I been wounded for some miles, so I decided to rest my head
I guess they let me go cause they assumed that I was dead""
Smiled and said “Son hop in this wagon and get settled”
He offered me a ride and drove me far away from my oppressor, forever

Guess I was on the road
Didn't know which way to go
I think I hear a praying man coming
A praying man coming
Sometimes I couldn't read the signs
My people done left me behind
I think I hear a praying man coming
I think I hear a praying man coming",https://genius.com/Big-krit-praying-man-lyrics
If I Fall,Live from the Underground,2012,"A, will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Will you uh uh uh uh catch me if I fall?
Yea, I gave my all

Cheah, aye I'm a man so I stand on my own two
I give a damn about a hater and his whole crew
No jump shot so I'm selling crack
To tell you the truth, I've been to Hell and back
No food in the kitchen so I'm scrapin' scraps
Tightest nigga in the world can't afford to rap
Now I'm on the hunt for a nigga to jack
Soon as I get rich I swear I'm givin' it back
It's cold out here, you gotta hold your own
I never knew what pain was until I was grown
I never miss my home boy until he was gone
But life goes on
So if I call

If I fall by the river bed
Would you save me or leave me dead?
All the blood I shed
And I'll just rest my head

Cheah, ain't nothin' easy 'bout the life I chose
Wasn't much of a choice, just the life I know
Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor just to kill time
When I'm fucked up, the only time I feel fine
Mama say I'm lettin' life go by
As if I ain't grindin', as if I don't try
But you can see in the eyes, she worry 'bout her baby
Late night, scared a nigga might play me
Police in the street don’t phase me
Get it how you live let em chase me
Bills still due, yea I can't stall
But that ain't all
So if I call

If I fall by the river bed
Would you save me or leave me dead?
All the blood I shed
And I'll just rest my head

Cheah, I used to love 'er, I used to hold 'er
She made me promise I'd never let 'er go
She made me smile, could've had my child
I held her tight like I never held before
But things change when you get older
She started drinkin' cause I ain't sober
That's when I told 'er
""Be careful 'bout the friends you keep
Cause the ones you call friends ain't friends to me""
Now we don't see eye to eye
The more I tell her the truth, the more she lies
The more we shoot each other down, the more we die
I think it's best that I said goodbye
So when I call

If I fall by the river bed
Would you save me or leave me dead?
All the blood I shed
And I'll just rest my head",https://genius.com/Big-krit-if-i-fall-lyrics

Young Krizzle
 I'm back again
Old school and I'm backin' out
Country boy still rep that rep that
Hit the bass and I'm actin' out
On the ave with a bad bitch stackin' clouds
Show a pimp what that ass about
In the parkin' lot deep while the whole world sleep
Pourin out hennessy 'til I'm passin' out
Gotta keep my eyes open cause I heard that five scopin'
For the car with the big ass sub and the top chopped off, so I drive slowly
Fuckin' bangin' in the back wood like a lac' should with the lights bright, windows tinted
Stopped at the gas station for a bag of chips
A fountain drink and some peppermints just to freshen up
Shawty say she down to fuck
But we gotta make a move cause it's after 2
And her man is the type to bust, she frightened of em' but I ain't though
Now she wonder what she came for
But I ain't trippin' no place, I ain't even gonna flip
Over another nigga bitch, move over to the next

(I still got my sub ho) jammin' on that drug flow
King Kong's in my trunk, in a fight with my thump, better let my sub go
Shawty in the front seat proceed to get high as fuck
She ain't worried 'bout her man no more
Hell, he don't know how to treat his ho
That nigga never ever slam no doors
I thought I saw some light but I'm trippin'
I gotta bust this right 'fore I miss it
I hit the super 8 because it's super late and she know the way and I dig it
All in my ear, have no fear, says she wanna fuck with me
Well, I told 'er that's all good while she grip my wood but a pimp don't fuck for free
She laughed and answered her phone, I swear it's 3 in the morn'
Like who could that be, she looked at me like he won't leave me alone
Well thats a damn shame, he don't know my name and I ain't got no time wit' yo folks
Lets just get this room and do what we do and be up out this thang around 4

Don’t Let Me Down,Live from the Underground,2012,"See, they wonder why we ride high
Why we get high
Shit, it's just to get by
See, some days, sometimes, the world lets you down
And you can't do nothing but fall
This is for y'all

Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down (uh-uh-uh-uh-oh)
Don't let me down

See, we be going through some things
Police hit the block and make it hard for us to hang
My girl bitch 'cuz all I ever do is swang and bang
Pourin' up I swear my liver never be the same
A pint of Hen'll get me in, help to ease the pain
World fucked up and I can't seem to leave the game
So I continue bending corners, bitches switching lanes
Ain't trippin' on the sun, sometimes I'd rather feel the rain
Get high to maintain, don't let me down

I made some plays that I regret, but that's just how it be
I lost some friends, fucked up some money, but stayed on my feet
I did all I could in my city so I had to bounce
I signed my deal and got more haters than I care to count
But I can't fault them for their feelings 'cuz I know the score
It's hard to celebrate for others when you're dying poor
So I keep rolling low-key, DOLO, trying not to stunt
I crank my system 'til it's clipping then I let it thump
Put all my problems in my cup while I grip the wheel
There's too much money to be had, I ain't sitting still
A country boy trying to make these petty ends meet
I learned my lesson, can't trust these niggas 'cuz they envy
Can't stop no show, I'm about this dough, and that's all I can say
Thank god for everything, I coulda died like yesterday
Make room for me in case my plane just ain't meant to fly
I hope you there if I fall from the sky, hollin' out don’t let me down",https://genius.com/Big-krit-dont-let-me-down-lyrics

I gotta get it while the gettin' good, get outside the hood
I’m tired of the landlord tripping on us
My partner said he gotta play, heard it worked the other day
I’ve been home late because I'm bendin' corners
Don’t worry, hit me via text, ain’t no need to stress
Gotta make some moves, I hate to leave you home lonely
I know just how it be when you in between the sheets
While I’m in the streets thinking need to be at home
Lord knows i'm outchea on the grind nigga
When I'm on the shine ain't no telling when I'm coming home
Remember that you said that pussy mine
Anytime you’d meet at the door with no panties on
And don’t be mad, playing hard to get
Cuz you could cum ‘til your heart content
Yea, I can feel your pain through the phone
I promise not to stay too long so leave the porchlight on

I'm coming home, baby it won't be long
I know you lookin’ fine, slide up behind ya

It won’t be long (baby leave the porchlight on)

I wanna see them eyes when I surprise ya
I promise I won’t stay too long so leave the porchlight on

Back out on the road again
Different city, in the studio, working on the flow again
I really wanna talk on the phone
Shorty I gotta finish this song, it won’t be long
Until we presidential suite, vaca'ing on the beach
Waikikiing for a week
Diamond in the back, leather on the seats
Louie on your frame, red bottoms on your feet
I mean the money can’t change how you feel right now
Even harder cuz you bother once the sun goes down
Wonder where I’m going after shows and such
Don’t be listening to your friends cuz they talk too much
Think I know just what we goin’ through, to make it right
I pray you understand this ain’t over night
I’ll be on the next flight on my way back home
I promise I won’t stay too long so leave the porchlight on

I'm coming home, baby it won't be long

Comin’ home
I wanna love you girl (baby leave the porchlight on)
You know I’m on my way (baby leave the porchlight on)

It's been a long time since I felt this way

It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got, got me, got me

Thunder cracking, another day to be chilling
Nothing to do but roll up and po' up and catch that feeling I had
Back when I was younger, used to bum from my partner's uncle
Had that smoke that smelled like dumpster
Something missing, I'm way too high to talk my pimping
So I sip my Remy, that's when I first got tunnel vision
Yea I saw it clearly, sunshine never shine like this
When I was sober off in the ? I never rhymed like this
I think I'm tripping, no I'm high, no I'm throwed
Well all I know is that my world is super slow
I like this better, light as a feather, too fly to land
Too throwed to drive in this weather

It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got, got me, got me

It's getting harder to explain the way I feel when I'm zoned
High as fuck, money stuck so don't call my phone
See I was young when I was tipping, but I wasn't tripping though
Perfect combination of elevation had me tipping slow
Fall asleep while we ride, cloud surf to my house
I never knew the strength of the drink until I melt away in my couch
And dream about the things I never had and all the places I couldn't go
Tried to play it cool around my folk but I was fucked up on the low
Eyes bloodshot red, can't get to my bed
Cup of lean in my stomach, ounce of smoke in my head
I ain't been this way in a while, it's cool, I need to relieve the stress
With all of the worries of this life, I blew it out my chest
I'm hydroplaning

Since I, since I felt this way
I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way

I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way

I'm hydroplaning
It's been a long time since I felt this way
Mix the drank with the dank got, got me, got me

Tryna hold on
But I'm steady getting higher as the sweet meets the fire again
Round 10, toe to toe with the green
See me I'm bobbing and weaving but he's choking me and cheating mane
Tryna train my lungs, to hang
Cause I'm gonna be smoking 'til Kingdom Come
Sang the songs that chose to make people roll up the mota
(And feel good like they supposed ta)
Wanna stay grounded but somehow gravity pulls me up
Am I upside down? Man what the fuck
Going on mane, hydroplaning
As I'm going up, not going insane but
Out of control, feel like it's out of my hands
Let me grab a hold before I crash land
Because it's like I'm going crazy, hydroplaning
I'm hydroplaning!",https://genius.com/Big-krit-hydroplaning-lyrics
Pull Up,Live from the Underground,2012,"When I pull up, it’s over (I pull up, it’s over)
When I pull up, it’s over (I pull up, it’s over)
When I pull up, it’s over (I pull up, it’s over)
Better cuff yo chick, this shit here legit

5 in the morning, wide and yawning, can’t turn my beat up
On the way to a bopper with a crib that I can kick my feet up
See the candy was shining, freshly priming, first time I seen her
Now she wanna ride high with her head in the sky look down on all her people
Ain’t it crazy how pavement be cracking when I’m slabbing them ‘bows
Hoes go to jump in and can’t find the handles on my doors
So much twerking and working in here, I should install a pole
For them strippers that love to suck and fuck and get, get down on the floor
Transformers can’t fuck with this, not the way my doors flip
Skyscraper tall when I creep and crawl, is that Krit or a solar eclipse
Rise of the apes in my trunk, while my chariot swanging down
Make a pro catch ghosts like the rapture approach when my old school come around


Say bitch I pulled up on the curb, straight peeled off with yo girl
Said she wanna ride with a pimp, wanna get that dick that she deserves
Said my back seat softer than a pillow top, paint so wet that it hit the spot
And I’ma quench ya thirst, that little nigga should’ve did it first
You was holding hands and I was in her purse
I’m getting throwed up under city lights
She right side checking lipstick, tryna make sure that her titties right
We in the parking lot with the trunk open and sipping
Sitting outside the whip with the wood grain wheel like it’s 1996
Yea trick I’m riding dirty, Big Sant bitch I know you heard me
Tryna get the ‘Lac with the ‘84s, tag just gon’ say “beg for mercy”
I just swerve and swang and bang it, but beware ‘cause a ho might leave you hanging
Better let ‘em know I’m forever ho, they kicking doors open, pay what you owe me
I told ‘em...


See pimping is what pimping is and macking do what it feels like
Drip the drape with that ? stitching and 4s and vogues so I feel right
Candy paint on that body mane, chrome the grill and that woman
Them belts and bucks and 5th wheel on the trunk, you’ll hear beat knock when I’m coming
That bass so hard that it’s numbing, that chrome so shiny it’s blinding
Them seats so soft that I’m sinking in and so it’s no need to recline ‘em
I drop the top and you see me, got different shit on each TV
Got one with Sopranos, one with The Wire, the one up front is Boardwalk Empire
Wood grain wheel so goddamn new, that sap come out when I grip it
I represent for that PAT and that H so hard, I’m still tipping
I chunk the deuce when I flip it, for my city I put on

Back one more ‘gain for all them players
Natural women and mindframe elevators
Ten toes down with this experimental south sound
Dope up the lines enough to go around and around and around this world thrice over
Ain’t nothing new under the sun back in ’05, I tried to told ya
We here 4Eva in a day, can’t go back with this one way
Take you to where the grass is much greener
Putting in work for my redeemer
Yea that’s the most high
I ain’t talking ‘bout blunts rolled
But like saved souls and warm welcomes at front doors
Don’t let your problems weigh you down
Don’t let them burdens slow yo pace
The quickest way from A to Z is straight
On that narrow path, a road less traveled
So free yo mind and be one with time ‘cause that’s all that matters
Not all that riff raff or random chit chatter
Haters scatters like jacks do
Don’t drop the ball unless you can pick up all the weight that a winner has to
Don’t let the struggle outlast you
Even if society outcasts you
Stand strong in your belief
The mountain top ain’t hard to see
When you let God and let be

Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?

Ok, I wake up fresh, get up fly, drape myself, pimp my ride
Hit that slab, throw some gold, making shawty get down on the floor
I’ma have to show my ass, ride on glass, pump my brakes, 
Pop my trunk, then I flash, a nigga wanna try to act bad
We don’t wanna play no games
Fuck with lames, trick on hoes, that won’t change
Caught my lane, swang and swerve, I gotta watch out for the curb
We don’t really play that, play that, yea! Yeen bout that, bout that, no!
Then don’t come round, come round, here! Cause we’ll let them, let them, go!


Ok, I jump out fresh, shine all day, rep my hood, rep my state
Spot a little bad chick around my way, and holler out let's get paid
Always been about my grind, bout my bread
Don’t like haters and I don’t like feds
Don’t like shawties that tease all day like they won’t give a real nigga head
Peep this game just to get this dough
Throw it in the air when you hit this floor
Yea that’s me sitting on chrome feet
Maybe when you couldn’t see when I crept up slow
Watch yo head when I open my door, grab yo parachute then let’s go
Dark in the club with a pimp on glow, everybody saw me take yo ho like…


Ay, balling, crawling, slamming doors! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Be a pimp tight player like I’m supposed! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Cuz my trunk on slam and my wrist on glow! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)

"King, Pt. 2",UnKnown,2012,"History remembers kings!
God bless you all!
I don't mean to burden you. It's just, umm, I had a conversation with a wise man. He asked me a question like, 
""How could you be in the position to say so much, but say so little,""
 so this is me saying a lot

I was raised from the Bible Belt,
 I tighten that, I'm Titan's back
Same game they claim that they killing, I'm breathing life in that
Take heed, the people you lead when you reciting that
You will die for what you believe, so where's your rifle at?
Never was entertained or influenced by all the drama
Hard to bury your partna, but harder to console her mama
That only want the best for her child
Save a place for his soul Lord, he ain't been to church in a while
Said that Jesus can't save him and ain't no church in the wild
His anger fueled his ambition, I swear he forgot how to smile
""Hustle hard, hustle hard,"" that's what he said
While counting up this bread that he fell for, now he dead
And they can't bring him back
They locking up my people, shawty, racks on top of racks
Public housing just too crowded God, shacks on top of shacks
Most pastors misleading people that listen
When all us black folk have is music and religion
A sense of self-respect
Lost in the need to express ourselves through money, drugs, and sex
I'm a product of the same, so I understand the texts
That says that she'll be down to fall victim to her flesh
If I'm worth it she'll undress
One night of slumber, harsh rains and violent thunders
As she leaves, ""Is she clean?"" Lord, I often wonder
See men turn mice for results, the clinic humbles
Plan B pill, God damn, your stomach rumbles
Laugh it off, but she'll keep it due to my numbers
So be it, I'll oversee that he runs and never fumbles
If it's a girl, I'll give her the world and sunny summers
And show her how to scrap in case her nigga jump on her
Protect them from the evils that TV often can feature
Beware of predators in this jungle, they out to eat ya
We all kings and queens, don't let no one else beseech ya
Life can throw ya some blows that leave ya swole, don’t let it beat ya
Don't let them feed you that bullshit that they fed me
Don't follow the road I took, look where it led me
I speak my mind and my heart, I bet they dread me
In a world of give me what you got, I always said free-dom
You been starving your soul so long that you should eat sum'n
You concerned with your followers, then lead them
To a well that only you and yours drink from
I build my own, fuck your playbook
Kingdom, that's how I feel, I'm strong in faith
Don't need for you to say that God ain't real
Somethings you just shouldn't play with
My soul patient cause success ain't ever save shit, face it
We all born to die, yea that's basic
But living fast and dying young ain't salvation
You keep on with that blasphemy and I'll keep on with my praying
If you think that Lambos hot in the summer, well hell's blazing
My mind frame blown cause my brother says that I'm on
He bored at the crib while I'm wishing that I was home
Said he die for the chance, and I reply to him he was wrong
Told him he could do better than me then hung up the phone
The youth, will surely go to war for what you own
To them it's more than real, but to you it's just a song
But to you it's just a song
But to us it's just a Psalm

I'm guilty of the same
Besides, no one person is to blame
I promise I'll change
I pray you do the same",https://genius.com/Big-krit-king-pt-2-lyrics
Thank You Kindly,UnKnown,2012,"Yea mane, first off I wanna thank God
Thank all my family, my friends
All the people that supported the movement from the beginning
Thank you if you bought the album
Even if you didn't buy the album, but you listened to it
Thank you for listenin'
That's all I ever wanted when I was younger anyway, yo

I went from ashy to classy
'05 mashin' the gas on they ass and spaz 'til somethin' happen
Outlast the flashy, trap route and passed it
Even when I was dead broke, I was far from average
Close to crashing, 
Shipes hit me
Off of the deal
, to be real I was quite gifted
But fuck it I'm ridin' with him to the finish
Ain't like labels was callin' on niggas from Mississippi
I gotta get it while the gettin' good
Get my partners and my loved ones out the hood
It's understood
That ? hit me with the title of my first tape that made the Earth quake
When it dropped, I swear to God, it felt just like my birthday
KRIT was here all of a sudden was the topic of discussion
Creative Control, videos was crushin', concussion
Some would say that I was merely lucky, but fuck 'em
Blog comments don't bother you as much when you suffered
On the come-up, for a meal ticket
Sometimes they didn't respect the south, I learned to deal with it
Still tow holo flow, I still kick it tape pop
Shout out to Watts for keepin' shit chopped, thank you kindly

K4L,
 GF 60 Zay boo, thank you kindly
The dutch, always holdin' their tour game down, thank you kindly
Def Jam, Cinematic, Multi, thank you kindly
From my lawyer to my business management, thank you kindly

Okay it's back to the basics, gotta turn it, rhyme, rev the crowd
Went on tour with Wiz, every night he shut it down
Smokers club, jumped out in the crowd, turned my music loud
Wally on the ones and twos, this country shit we all about
Jet life, shout out to my nigga Spitta
Roddy, Trademark, Fiend, Corner Boy and Smoke DZA
That's my brother
The king of New York to me and none other, that's my opinion
Big Sant been spittin' since I can remember
He ain't no hype man, he the right man to kill a nigga flow-wise
Showed me how to write bars in my partner's ?
Twelve years later and we still screamin' Multi
Much love to Sha for keepin' it real
In these days where niggas is skilled but never get deals
Or get dropped by the labels for doin' music he feel
The radio don't play, but we will
In the car that beat with subs and tweets
Shout out to everybody that copped LFU the first week
I appreciate you buyin' and if I never told you before, stay blessed
And thank you kindly

To all the supporters of real hip hop
To all the real people out there
To all the coasts, all the people overseas
All the producers, all the artists
Any and everybody that showed me love
And even the people that didn't, hah

I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

I call your phone
You don't pick up, you text me
Too late to come back you say my art ain't even half the way it used to look
The colors that I chose to compose my last masterpiece wasn't worth the cover of a book
I listen as you rant on 'bout Rembrandts and Van Goghs
That, I used to show you was so pure at heart
Now all the pictures that I draw lately perfect my need to be basic and all the shading tears your world apart
Pollock I promise you say it's scribble and scratch
I know you don't mean it cause on your wall's where it sat
It's not my best I agree but I did what I could
With these sticks and these stones to get us out of the woods
I find my rhythm and and my stroke then you fall in love with my art like you did before
On that note I let go and tend to my canvas to paint a mural of us
I hope that you understand the bigger picture

I wish you saw the bigger picture

I pray you see the bigger picture

Back to my roots
Channel my youth
You love the color of yellow but I'm working with blue
Like what's the use of doing art if I ain't breaking the rules
My graffiti wasn't Banksy but you thought it was cool
It used to be fun to watch me do what it do
But when the paint started drying I stopped running to you
I started walking away cause I could paint any day
One line from being complete
I'm sorry I made you wait to get a crown and some space
I thought you'd be a great painter
Cause you could see the good in me in all the angles
A radiant child we could've had
And those clowns in your past you paint, just make you laugh
All because, that self portrait that I put on display should've been of us
I left you out and I was wrong
I promise I'll start over if you come back home

Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

I'll paint the sky blue
I'll paint the grass green
I'll paint the roses red
And everything in between
I'll paint the sky blue
I'll paint the grass green
I'll paint the roses red
And everything in between

How dare I rap about my real life
Good Lord I gave my all but this don't feel right

Was I wrong to be so heavy-hearted?
I refuse to give up what I started
For false awards and cover boards in every store
A different shore is a bore when all my people poor
Yeah there's some broads galore but yeah I wanted more
Fuck a reality show, I'd rather do a tour
I'd rather crowd surf
Before I live as if God ain't real, I'd rather die first
Bury me inside a cemetery
Remember me as just a visionary
I'm more Geronimo Pratt than OG Bobby
They love the fact you made it but hate the fact you got it
The stairway to Heaven is packed, I'm in the lobby
Too scared to go to sleep cause most times I often doubt my dreams

I told myself, I should be smart and not blind
Bang, bang, bang, down we went today
Lord, I think there's something wrong
Bang, bang, bang, another bullet went astray
Another soul dead and gone

I heard a gun the other day
It spoke to me and told me power
Was the only thing that we could lose
So don't be afraid to let it shower
On them, if they ever run up at my door
It came with a red dot, for sure shot, and a silencer on the low
I had to stop and pause and think about it
While it gave me its resume
Told me no better way to protect myself
In this world we live in
Cause they killing up women and children
Ain't nothing like having one on hand
Cause if you draw down first you'll be the man
Then you'll pop your trunk and demand
That respect, if they neglect, in the club
When they touched my queen they didn't know what we had was love
And it'll never be the same cause you'll throw it in my face just because
So I'll pop my trunk once again
For her heart I'll defend
And I'll let it rain on them,

You looking for the kinda clip that don't stop
Cause you heard the jack boys coming for the very spot
That you opened up on they block
They wore red but you bang blue,
 
they drove by but they ain't shoot
Till you was outside with the whole fam, havin' brews, talkin shit, eatin' barbeque
Duck and dodge, but it ain't safe, you hit the corner but they gave chase
And double back cause you got away
But your little cousin got hit
Sleepin in his baby crib
No CPR cause it's too late
So you cry, but you bounce back
Your reply is to get the gat
It's an eye for an eye till it's jet black
The only way you'll survive in your mind is to stay strapped
So you act out
They'll call you soft if you back out
So you roll your window down and you black out
They next day they'll be back 'round

Might have to mop that up
She say what’s happenin'?, I’m trynna fuck

Good lord, good lord
It feels good to shine
Shine
Let's go

By the time you probably heard this
I was on another verse bitch
Diamonds in the back with curtains
Breaking hoes off, I never dose off at my post
Never disrespect your host, or bite the hand that feed ya
Cufflinks cold as Ebenezer, my momma probably should of named me Caesar
Cleaner than a baptist preacher
That use to pimp
Gator shoes don't make the man
So primp primp
So keep on with that, like I won't whip back
Around in that lac, that you done seen
Don't worry about this, I'm serious about this
If you know what I mean
Shine on

Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
Ain't nobody tripping 'cause the money already made

So lately I've been observing
A lot of these niggas look nervous
Come on in, don't be ashamed
Go and steal some game from my sermon
'Cause elevation to celebration, I preach that there
And that bullshit that they serving y'all, I don't eat that there
Keep that plate, I got my own
Don't test my patience, bitch, I'm grown
It ain't much you can tell me Granny ain't already told me
And she wasn't wrong, yeah, we that strong
So fuck your umbrella, rainy weather, and all that shade
If God ain't want me to shine, he never would've let me chop on blades
So shine on

Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
Ain't nobody tripping 'cause the money already made

They say man make money, money don't make the man
But it's a little bit of both
'Cause it will take some change, for you to make some change
That ain't just some shit I wrote
Man, that's natural fact, and not evolution
My mind game still evolving
And I'm gonna keep on rolling like 24's
And this world just keep revolving
Good at problem solving, 'cause I'm good at starting shit in first place
And it feels so good to be where I'm at man
'Cause where I was, was the worst place
But time change, so I keep hustling
Boys trying to make my time cease
But I'm laid back with my dime piece
Shining hard like my time piece and its on

Shine on
Don't get me wrong
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we shining on
It's way too strong
Yeah, yeah, shine on
Good Lord they know it
Now, now, we shining on
Ain't nobody tripping 'cause the money already made

Shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
I need you to come on one more time and just shine babe
Shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby
I need you to do it like you do and just shine baby
Shine baby
Shine baby

One more time for all my folk 'm gone shine babe
Shine baby

They can't stop me from shining on my own

Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining
Ain't no shining like we shining, babe)

WTF,King Remembered in Time,2013,"Yeah
I wrote a poem the other day
The punch line is 'What the fuck we gon' do now?'
Cause you gotta ask yourself
That it's always a situation you get yourself in you'll be like damn
What the fuck I'm gon' do now?

When the world turns upside down on my head
And I can't sleep no longer, eat no longer unless it's a full course meal
I'm tired of boiling water, that cook noodles that cost a quarter
What about steak and veal, I'd like to pay all my bills
None the Lord, but struggle I feel
My heart's too cold to warm your soul
My eyes are too closed to see your goals when I can barely see mine
Some are saying I'm blind to the fact when
Really I'm just blind by all these LED lights on your Benz
That make me feel less of a provider cause I can't splurge when I spend
It ain't world wide when I trend, shopping for hand me downs
Second nature tags for those pants we found
At the flea market, checking for a plea bargain on this shirt
Perhaps you got some work
I ain't talking about nine to five
More like soaking drive, baking soda powder pies
I can bag up anything you fry
If you got a ticky I can sell anything you buy
No harm done my brother, perhaps if I sell to you
And you sell to them then
We never sell to one another
Preach on if you must, two things to remember
Don't tell on me and don't use your own product
Cause that will surely thrust you into the abyss
Longing for things you miss, stuck in the 1980's
Talking about you Prince, ain't nothing appealing about laying in your piss
And walking in shit
Come up off your hustle, we can ride clean if we sell double
Then them laws coming we fall victim
To the stereotypical big rims fly niggas on the wrong side of town
Blowing loud, double cup, both windows down
That's when I look at you and you look at me
And we ask ourselves, what the fuck we gonna do now?

What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do now?
What the fuck we gonna do? What the fuck we gonna do?
What the fuck we gonna do now? What the fuck we gonna do?
What the fuck we gonna do? What the fuck we gonna do?
What the fuck we gonna do now? What the fuck we gonna do now?

I scoped her from a mile away
More enticed by her hips, I should say
I didn't see her face until I was front and center
Spitting that kind of game that was fundamental
Yeah I'm baller as such
After she removed her clutch from the seat it occupied
That checker board pattern had once again monopolized
That the Louie, her taste was one of those labels
And her story was one of her fables that I heard as a young child
That everything that glitters ain't gold
And some tigers are better left wild
But that never stop me, and her ring won't stop her
As we sip more alcoholic beverages on the roof tops of seduction
Her peanut butter skin blushing with lustful hues
To the bathroom she was again asked to be excused
I think she abuses the substance
But who am I to judge her want to lose her inhibitions
Then wipe away her past to free fall into existence
I know that feeling so we quarter the night away as two lonely strangers
Intertwine and entertainment in the spiral of cat and mouse
I'm ready when you are to hit the room
To be consumed in your sunshine
Let's pretend this ain't the first time
Let's pretend I am your man
Let's pretend we both clean and we know it
Perhaps I don't do this often
Perhaps you ain't out here ho'in
Maybe this was meant to be
Maybe you're the very woman God sent for me
In the morning surely I doubt it
More regret the fact I planted my seed in your green house and it sprouted
My mind was too cloudy to comprehend your decision
Two months later your stomach will grow from my adulterous conviction
Your husband will surely put 2 and 2 together
That one night when you didn't come home it last forever
And we can never let this down, your phone call was so profound
Cause he kicked you out and your pregnant, so?
What the fuck we gon' do now?",https://genius.com/Big-krit-wtf-lyrics
Serve This Royalty,King Remembered in Time,2013,"Ah, the way the brother walks is beautiful, the way he talks is beautiful
Uh, the brother is beautiful
The way he makes love to me is beautiful
You know, that's my man!

Platinum chains and rings is
All a brother knows now
Girl, you one of the first to know that
Gold is back in town
So you gotta serve this royalty
Believing in me and my dreams
Serving this royalty right
Trust what I say and what I see and we can get it

Yeah
Money, cars and clothes, and all the cribs
Never trust these lames and hoes cuz they ain't shit
Cuz they’ll just sink our dreams of things and jump ship
So we'll fly first class, full glass with blunts lit - float on
I shake the world if you hold on
Get your body off, just to turn your soul on
Your black is gold so when it dark, get your glow on
My words are heavy like a Chevy, shall I roll on?
Our love's unlimited
Vinyl record in the grooves of forever, bass and treble, bend this shit
Puff cut your affections like a painting God ain't finished with
Now had to be displayed so all these songs could say they finished it
I walk the talk so I can't run game
I'm the type of King that a need a Queen thats down to work and run things
I'm a lion baby, untamed
Before I devote my all I need to know one thing
Can you serve this royalty

Platinum chains and rings is
All a brother knows now
Girl, you one of the first to know that
Gold is back in town
So you gotta serve this royalty
Believing in me and my dreams
Serving this royalty right
Trust what I say and what I see and we can get it

Whatever your heart desires
And to those that oppose our dreams and goals I set the world on fire
Go to war with giants of all kinds
So when you sleep without your King beside you you sleep fine
I be you knight in shining armor, swing down with a hammer like Thor for those that want drama
Travel high and low for those expensive garments that I
Peel off your frame after I fight in your honor
Cuz we can rule as far as the eye can see
If you down for the cause as long as your body breathe
Bet the heir that will proceed as Kings that's after me
But be colder than doors we close you'll have to be
There'll be tyrants that want nothing more than apathy
To defile on the kingdom of real and happiness
But history will whisper of our reign
Before I give my all, I need to know one thing
Can you serve this royalty

Platinum chains and rings is
All a brother knows now
Girl, you one of the first to know that
Gold is back in town
So you gotta serve this royalty
Believing in me and my dreams
Serving this royalty right
Trust what I say and what I see and we can get it

The dream is real if you serve this royalty
Leave your mama's house, make her proud
Serve this royalty right
From the valleys of Spain to the snowy banks of Maine
We can run this game
If you serve this royalty right

Thats right, she's behind me 100%, man
She believes in everything I believe in
And whatever I do, she go and ride along with me and do it at the same time, you know?
With no doubt in her mind cuz she know that I'm positive, and she knows that I'm out to get over, and she knows that I'mma try and get a piece of this country",https://genius.com/Big-krit-serve-this-royalty-lyrics
Only One,King Remembered in Time,2013,"You thought you were the only one ballin'
You thought you were the only one slabbed out
You thought you were the only pimpin'
In the V.I with the broads and they ass out
You thought you were the only one...
Naww playa..
You thought you were the only one...
Naww playa..

Now I apply pressure, yessuh, gold on my dresser
Effortlessly perfected this pimpin' to the neck up
And with it, I can dress up, any pro into a pretzel
Figure 'fore she figure more dick might destroy her vessel
Mo'-mo'-most not the lesser, it's how I judge my worth
Cuz the last time I tripped ova pussy was probably at my birth
And the last time I didn't pop my trunk was probably at my church
But as soon as I left the parking lot, I maxed it out till it burst
Wood grain in my wheel, princess cut in my grill
Butter fly my steak, shrimp and lobster on chill
Do it how I feel, cuz doin' what you love won't hurt ya
Plus an L7 could never understand the complexity of my circle
Or the dynamics of a twerker, or the inner workings of a squirter
Its like chemistry with this codeine, two parts cup one purple
3 more time that's charm, bad bitch on my arm
Come and go as I please, whole world in my palm

You thought you were the only one ballin'
You thought you were the only one slabbed out
You thought you were the only pimpin'
In the V.I with the broads and they ass out
You thought you were the only one...

You thought you were the only one...

Chocolate-chip cookies on my tray
True stoner I get high just as sure as the sun come up to light up the day
A real boss up in the game don’t have to pay to play
We burnin’ down come smoke a pound I’m just a flight away
I earned the right to say I’m rich off what I write today
And stickin’ to my cheese like a microwave
Broke niggas they don’t like us they don’t wanna fight
Shout out to Max cuz you could never ride the wave but me I got the title
OG kush in my joint, Ooo, all my niggas on point, Ooo
Ride around reppin’ that gang, T.G.O.D. come join
You niggas do a show there and don’t get no love
I sell a hundred thousand tickets when I show up
They say the game done changed
Well that mean, you need to change too
And stop with all that fuckin’ hatin
Cuz that’s what motherfuckin’ lames do

Rightt
You ain't the only nigga gettin’ money got it down to a science
Big nigga, bank teller, think I play for the Giants
Dead fresh, walk by and get a moment of silence
Don’t be mad because we livin’ dog, be mad at the Mayans
Riding deciding live maine or peeking
Who said hustlers can’t be king
Wrists got crowns on 'em bad hoes is beasting mista
Slide the first day, instant upgrade
Thompson my jacket, Black Label my denims
Very rare my kicks, this petty cash that I’m spendin’
With the rich folks bout to blend in
Got a obsession for this game Bob Lemon
Gangsta, hustla, shit I bleed it, keep these niggas heated
I don’t do reservations I walk in and get seated
Best believe it this harlem kids the meanest
Trippy stickin’ at the table smell the smoke but they don’t see it

You thought you were the only one ballin'
You thought you were the only one slabbed out

King Without A Crown,King Remembered in Time,2013,"4eva is a mighty long time
I do it for the South and them folks that held me down
Forever in the game, forever Multi
Forever getting mine, forever on the grind
What's a king without a crown ho?
What's a car without some sound ho?
What's a king without a crown ho?

Sometimes all I need a bass
And a little liquor to ease my mind a bit
Cause even when you polished, niggas won't let you shine for shit
That pot to piss in turned into a house on hill
I'm talkin' two stories no fabrication, that's a true story for real
And ain't no ghost writer, my flow tighter than gorilla fists
Keep it poppin' like hot grease, fried up with your catfish
Cut throat with that bucket seats, bust a quiche, I split her peach
Young Krizzle, fruit ninja, crouching tiger, hidden freak
Ho what's up, I got more to tell
Dreams is cheap I got more to sell
Crush linen, grain grippin', don't touch my buttons
I hate it when a bitch gets overzealous
So chill ho
I got a point to prove, that's the reason I rhyme fo'
Third coast, I put it down fo'
What's a king without a crown ho?

One more time for them folk that didn't know
Two more time for them folk that didn't listen
Three more time for them folk that said growth
Was impossible, for a country boy
Like they could spit, like they could flow
Shawty everybody wanna be a rapper
But everybody out can't do a show
So I'm slammin' doors and work the wheels on her
Pop my bands and pop a bill on her
Shit changed since Krit Wuz Here
I raise my glass and crack a seal on her
Cause I deserve that, got a old school
Let me swerve that, in my own lane
I make my own beats, I write my own rhymes
I grip my own grind, I grip my own grain
And that's royalty
How else I'm 'sposed to live?
I made do with what God gave, I do exactly what I feel
Yeah I play my part and I gave my heart and I represent for my crib
Just like them kings that came before me, I'mma keep it trill
Let's go!

Life Is a Gamble,King Remembered in Time,2013,"Life is a gamble, oh baby
Where you win or lose
Life is a gamble

They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em

I roll the dice one time for my folks that died off
Rep the side they believe in but they side lost
Let me toss a seven for the ones won't see tomorrow
Cash those chips in for some time we don't need to ball
Gunshots ran out, everybody hang out
Yellow tape party, all over we sang out
I don't like this feeling, ain't nothing that appealing
Bout reminiscing, over you, my God
I couldn't cry cause your mama couldn't stop crying
And that's hard, lord I wish my folks would stop dying
But who am I to say it wasn't your time to black out?
You betted all on a spot, I guess you crapped out
For the finer things, indeed we chase
We told you pace yourself
It's funny, how the things we love, can make us hate ourselves
Russian roulette table, I gotta bet safer
You gotta know when to fold your cards
When you ain't able to reach into that dash when that
Jackal up and flashed that, brass like
Give me all you got or that's your ass
That's all that it would took, the house got me shook
Cause ain't no point spread, but god doing books

They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em

Life is a gamble feel like I'm rambling sometimes
Like what the fuck I'm sposed to say in this rhyme
I shed tears and they won't come back
I said the word and they won't run back
My slot machine was broken this time
Ain't no tokens, I can't redeem to preserve the focus of mine
So many died and I'm scared it's just a matter of time
For I'm lifted myself, six people I know
Ain't been in church in a while, I heard I reap what I sow
Casket close, Caddy doors, can't commemorate
This tracks my gurney, my verse can be the ventilator
So I breathe, cause Loathing in Las Vegas wasn't meant for me
Too scared I'll stay too long and forget where I'm really meant to be
Heaven maybe, heaven lately, but all these lights are captivating
I had to play it, for the sake of me and mine
Lord, I pray I hit it big this time

They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
Shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em
They say life (is a gamble)
So be careful when you shake em up, shake em up, shake em up, shake em

Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together baby
Cause we go good together

I'm talking early morning fresh
Get up, get out and get gone
Thank God for the sun and the chrome
That I pushed when we rolled
In that Brougham or Fleetwood 'Lac de Ville
Goosebumps trunk, yeah it gave ya chills
Popped up twice just to show your grill
Left the comfort of her home to roll with me
Cause she was searching for something real
I be that nigga, be that fresh
Leave that lame, be with a winner
Relieve that stress
Jump online, I free your mind
We don't need no dime, at least not mine
Spend this check
Buy that Benz or ride that Lex and drape our necks
Like kings and queens
Cause if you down to shine, I make love to your fertile mind
Till you conceive my dreams

Cause we could be kings and queens
And highs and lows and wires and vogues

Fill you up when you on E
Pick you up when you want feet
Be your guide, I be your eyes
When you can't see, I be your air
When you can't breathe
I give you game but it ain't free
You gotta be down for the play
When we up, we can shine, but prepare for the grind
Cause the Lac could break down any day
Would you be willing to hit licks?
I ain't the type to boast and nitpick
But it takes some hard work to get rich
It's a small risk to rock the red bottoms and bop the fresh fits
What you want, what you need
Gotta have, when we shop, gotta grab
Never hear, put em back, in fact
Just be careful how you spend you cash

Cause we could be kings and queens
And highs and lows and wires and vogues
And anything that goes

Sub-woofers and vogues
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby
Just like wires and vogues
Neon trunks and glow
We go good together, baby
We go good together, baby

Cause we could be kings and queens
And highs and lows and wires and vogues

Enjoy the fruits of your labor
The spoils of war

Where the wine flows in abundance
And the tables are set
Feast and be thankful",https://genius.com/Big-krit-good-2getha-lyrics

Cluckin' bustas freakin' and fuckin' for nothing
So how you figure I was tricking off?
Candy paint my Caddy frame don't be ashamed to lick it off
Hail Mary some game to a dame and you can't pick it off
Off the chain (Hoo!) I can't sic it off
Time and time again I try and tell them let me kick it off
And bang on it, I put these lames on it
It ain't Multi if ain't put my name on it
Make that kinda track and put a train on it
Styrofoam, purple rain on it
Fresh up out the cleaners, my demeanor, not a stain on it
Reign on it, put some chains on it, bet the game on it
My woofer beat to the frequency that a bitch done came on it
Pinky ring on em, chinchilla get hanged on the floor

They know it's us
They sick and ain't no Robituss to help ‘em out
I been official, big dawg in the yard
Voted most likely to murder every verse that I start
So as soon as I park and I hop on that ride
Better leave with your bitch, 'fore I'm off in her mouth
Cuz I'mma big timer rhymer, no co-signers around for you
If I ain't make that clear let me break it down for ya
They lame (yeah), we not (yeah), see us (yeah) on top (yeah)
Alumni forever ever bitch

Shit, I got the hook up, bitch
What you know 'bout this?
Old school my whip
King Tut my wrist

Tires on rotation and the bass still buzzin'
Old school whip with the A/C cuttin'
Calibrate the navigation, bitch don't touch it

Broke another bank and put it in they face
Ever since I rolled up with the doors on Transforma'
Four done poured up, niggas had to hate
Wheels on chrome, I had to slow my four's up
Cuz them potholes deep and I can't let them scrape

Purpose,King Remembered in Time,2013,"*Baby crying*

I was born in '86, despite the wolves and rats
Survived the wild and returned with these bear furs on my back
To feed the family, drink the wine
Give thanks to God and watch for signs
The winter's cold
But we was chose to rise above the darkened skies
And fight against what lied beneath
My feet are firmly on the ground
Prepare my soul and grit my teeth, fight or flight is going down
What man amongst me says that I ain't fit to wear my Father's crown?
A King of Mine and mine alone, my blood line can't be renounced
Stand up and be counted for, raise your fist as Glory speaks
Heaven's what I'm dying for, I swear the Devil's at war with me
I deal with life accordingly one day at a time
And that kingdom we all searching for I pray one day we find
So many have long and gone, so many got left behind
But as time travels and Earth unravels, church bells still chime
Planets still align as angels watch over
I break the chains they gave me and put these medals on my shoulders
Cause I ain't no simp

You'll be different
You'll find comfort in family
Your power lies in your faith and beliefs
What's a king without a crown?
Or a kingdom to call his own?
This is purpose",https://genius.com/Big-krit-purpose-lyrics
"King, Pt. 3",UnKnown,2013,"This is for them soul believers, eager to be achievers
And all those old folk on their porch that used to oversee us
It takes a village to stop the pillage of serpent seekers
Under protection from weapons I pray that God can keep us
We run away from things that used to reach us
Rather the Bible than a rifle, what can balling teach us?
Crossover, the pennies and loafers now we have to spend
Sitting on sofas, barely sober waiting on the end
Be a rapper or a Christian, KRIT
Cause in this game, there's no room for that religion shit
Acrobatic flip my temper cause I remember
It's either Heaven or Hell, and that shit simple
Fall asleep in pews the choir ""Ooohs"" would sooth
The battered hearts of many that life could often abuse
Who are you to mock my healing? What's a message without feeling
I don't care if you paid for mine, I'm just hoping that you listen
I might 
if we don't talk about your top 5
Let's just pretend all this shit ride
Turn a long road to a short drive
Overflow with ambitions, so why we wasting time?
Your inner glow ain't for dimming, I swear you're wasting shine
My time ain't for spilling, so don't be wasting mine
Don't be wasting mine
Or I can't

Like I left you at the podium
Niggas screaming out, ""Family,"" but I ain't knowing them
Mad, cause the false love they give me, I ain't showing them
I paid my dues, no I ain't owing them
What's a rock to a mountain, so why you throwing them?
Holding a, grudge nigga
When I was on 3-hunna gave a fuck about where you was, nigga
Can't you see I'm stuck in my ways? I never budge, nigga
Where you at be content with self
Jealousy inevitably ain't good for your health
Although I feel some type of way, I hope you acquire wealth
And never know what it's like to have your own blood wish your own death
I'll forget the situation, miscommunication
Could've been solved, just as simple as a nigga waiting
As a nigga waiting
But we can't

In the same mind frame that got us here
Show your cards and you're a fraud: David Copperfield
Drop a song with no heart, that shit ain't hot for real
I told my niggas, ""I might quit,"" they're like, ""KRIT, you're not for real""
Then I repeated what I said, bur even more sincere
Face hot look where we stopped, I cannot go from here
Lord, how can I flow from here?
I dropped over 200 songs, what can I show from here?
And I'll stop with all the frustration
I respect their opinion, but I still think they're hating
Waiting on the day that K.R.I.T Wuz Here, ain't some shit I'm chasing
Downplaying my album, that shit was far from basic
Murder rappers, buried them on more than one occasion
And hold a candlelight vigil for the beats I'm making
Write about my life and what's right 'til my hands is aching
Only for a nigga to look at me like, ""KRIT, who the fuck you saving?

DJ booth with the pole in the middle
For the edge of the rest to go flash up a bitch
See how far these vegetables get us
Pour up, the show up, the focus
The doors ain't typical when they get open, hol' up
You ain't never been sky high
Swear I coulda died when I hopped out my ride
Like four or five times, no parachute
Bungee jump for the loot
Hock a loogie out the roof, what I feel like
Porn on the screen, two hoes on the scene tongue kissin'
You would think my whip dyke

Not sure if it's the sawed-off pump or the bass in the trunk that keep a nigga shook

It's some neon that's red, that's my old shit
But this some cold shit
That my granddaddy wish he could have drove in, then passed down
So in honor of Zebby, I bring a ho down like a levee
When I slab 'round in this glass house
See me in it, it was easy pimpin', 'fore you even finish trick or treating trippin', she wasn't even with it, she was outside the Lac tryna ease in it

Soul Food,Cadillactica,2014,"What happened to the soul food?
What happened to the soul food?
I’m talkin' good eatin', good seasonin'

Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

Grandma's hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Now before Sunday school, I hustle and I'm on it
I can't slow down, nah, a dollar and a dream
In this life you live, you're either the dealer or the fiend
Leanin' horizontal
The acrobats on the corner, they flip
So when them white vans pull up, shawty, we dip
Out of view, could've been a track star at the school
But it took the police just to get that .44 out of you
Dash, sprint, hurdle, over those steel gates
They keep us in and keep folk out but we don't feel safe
As we used to back when we was in a booster
Watchin' our uncles drink coolers, talkin' pound-for-pound bruisers
Over rib bones
Now I sideways tote
How did Bobby Johnson hold it?
Pull the trigger 'til the clip gone
Potato tip, no potato salad
That American pie ain't even snappin'

Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

Aromas on the corner, these the soul, they say
Some greens just can't be cleaned and you can't wash out the taste
Of rotten roots
Salted looks and herbs
If it ain't made with love then it ain't fit to serve, I heard
Some get bruised and battered
Thrown away half eaten as if their seeds never ever mattered
It ain't ripe, it ain't right
That's why most people don't make love no more
They just fuck and they fight
What happened to the stay-togethers?
Yeah, I’m with you and that means forever
Grandparents had that kind of bond
But now we on some other shit
Nah, we ain't got no rubbers here
I know she creepin' so that ain't my son
Apples fall off of trees and roll down hills
We can't play games no more cause we got bills
Back in the day, the yard was oh so filled
Now nobody comes around here

Out here in this world, just tryna make it
Everything I see, sometimes I can't take it
But damn I really miss those times
That soul food's on my mind
Mind, mind, mind

(Never thought it'd be, no soul food on my plate
We gather 'round and lie, bow our heads and pray
And I)
I still remember, the family parties
The happy faces, no broken hearts
Nobody starvin', but all that there is old news
What happened to the soul food?

From across the room
I can see your soul babe
I think you my soul mate
My two eyes saw you third eye
From across the room
You remind me of a Goddess
Pardon if I fall in love too soon

I hate to rap and live life all alone
And I know this world is full of so many clones
But you original in your aura, it's sort of
Radiant and I can't ignore it
So, I don't wanna buy you no drank
Besides, I think you'd rather smoke your dank
And that's cool
I know you came with your friends
So you choose
If you wanna share your vibe, it's on you
It'd be a lie if I didn't say just the other day
I dreamed of picket fences and children playin' instruments
A lot of incense in one instance
I saw your face, you were full of Grace
At least that's what we named her
My angel had a angel, and I was so thankful
I know I barely know you, but I think you're so amazing
Fascinating, breathtaking
More than enough, my inspiration

My two eyes saw your third eye
From across the room
I can see your soul babe
I think you my soul mate
My two eyes saw you third eye
From across the room
You remind me of a Goddess
Pardon if I fall in love too soon

To be honest this is all new to me
Cause I ain't never know a third eye that I could see
Perhaps you're not in a space you're really supposed to be
We all hit the club from time to time to be set free
So, I won't judge if you won't judge
I think we both agree that this ain't the place for love
But I've known you in my past life somewhere, somehow
Stars aligned and brought us here, with no doubt
It'd be a lie if I didn't say you were something classic, far from average
I apologise if I'm oh so ol' fashioned
But I'm passionate about your passions
More intrigued with your mind
Than your ass and your assets
I'm asking how you feel
If I told you that I knew heaven was real
Cause only God could create something that gives me chills
So angelic and so surreal, I'm being sincere that

My two eyes saw your third eye
From across the room
I can see your soul babe
I think you my soul mate
My two eyes saw you third eye
From across the room
You remind me of a Goddess
Pardon if I fall in love too soon",https://genius.com/Big-krit-third-eye-lyrics
Lost Generation,Cadillactica,2014,"(I wish we could stay to see what happens)
We have to let them find their way, but we will create again

Came back like the Mack, Caddy cut dime in the back
Eight track slap off the rack, I have to relapse
Po' of the fo' out the tap, break a pro back 'til it snap
She lives in my lap, eager to give up her snatch
Still on the prowl for my match
The milk and the honey, it's all about the love of the money
Space age pimp was adept, that's after the fact
Land and I make contact, destroy if they give their bomb back
Prepare for combat, peace and love still beyond that
Share the win with my comrades, that's actual fact
Odd, but they actually lack at the peak of impact

This ain't meant to be preached on
This here meant to be teached on
I know that you ain't got much time
I promise this rhyme won't take long
You need it in your life like you need a better job
Like you need another hobby
Instead of waiting in the lobby, with the soft and the hard
Until the police holla copy, freeze
I know how it get when you ain't got shit to flush
And them balloons you bought getting bust
'Cause everybody want mo' than what they really say so
You don't know who to trust
On the outside looking in of the Beamer, Bentley, Benz
Dreaming about the backseat
But you don't know what the driver had to do just to pass by you
That's if you ask me
So, shawty, don't do the dash on 'em
I hope you never crash on 'em
What good is flashin' or livin' the fastest
If you in a casket? I couldn't imagine
My mama hanging over me crying
'Cause my soul is too young to let go of me
I'm saying what I gotta
Cause the club songs ain't saving my partner

Grew up on the country side of town

M-I crooked my nigga
Do it for the south, ya'll know
Born and raised where the rebel flag hang from the slaves
Grew up where ya'll niggas won't go
Rep that, rep that shit like I own it
I did it big for my fam and my homies
I got the biggest house on my block, foreign with the drop
For the times I was out here homeless, God flow
Time and time again I tried to tell these niggas
Yo what I say to these niggas?
Reebok, on tap dance, do whatever for a sack
Give a lap dance bitch ass nigga
Fee-fi-fo coked up
25 lighters on my dresser, ain't shit changed
Rollin' in the  ham sandwich on propellers lookin' like a strech
I'm so clean you think I might be selling cocaine
Light at the end of the tunnel
When you're flexin' it's hard to be humble
Talkin' fourth down, can't throw the ball to Def Jam
Cause they might fumble
Kick that south flow that you can't get
Try to fuck the world but my dick won't fit
My bitch like ""KRIT, motherfuck they feelings
You wanna be king, gotta claim that shit""
I'm talkin' 'bout off with they heads
When you put on a mink, gotta creep down stairs
When you come from the country
Your feet on the snakes would will make clothes out of bears
I ain't playin' no games
I leave with the future, you follow these lames
I embody the South, the swing, the grain
The trunk with the bang, the gold in their mouth

Grew up on the country side of town

Ain't no love in the coliseum
This shit here been a bloodsport
Keep what you kill, fuck if they live
Cause everybody out here cutthroat
I've been quietly waitin'
Deep in my dungeon, my stomach was rumblin', my belly was achin'
Everybody wanna see a monster
Till they see the monster, the monster holla out, ""What's shakin'?""
I know what you thinking, this nigga shit, must not be stankin'
He must not know better at all
Titans collide, only Zeus could survive
If not me bitch, who the fuck you gone call?
To rain from the mountain tops
Still blood stains on the leaves
I don't do it for the blog spot comment box, I do it for the OGs
And them country folk that can't talk that shit
This ain't your curb, don't walk that bitch
This ain't your porch, so keep off that shit
Go find a cliff and jump off that bitch
If you don't think that I'm king
I done proved them wrong like twice, can't stop my fight
I could murder your favorite rapper
And all I get is ""No way a Mississippi nigga really that nice!""
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em, fuck em
I said it six times cause it's my pleasure
Say it one more time for just for good measure, fuck em
Raised by the King that before me
Slowly crept up and still paid dues
I embody the South, the swang, the bang
The soul and the pain and the blues

Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
Grew up on the country side of town
Now I'm ballin' under city lights
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
King of the south, king of the south, king of the south
Grew up on the country side of town",https://genius.com/Big-krit-king-of-the-south-lyrics
Saturdays = Celebration,Cadillactica,2014,"If they kill me on Friday
Bury me on Sunday
Mourn for me Monday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
If they kill me on Tuesday
Bury me on Wednesday
Mourn for me Thursday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
'Cause Saturdays are for celebration

Mama, no need to worry 'bout me
I promise that I'll be home soon
God got me like every day
While the Devil like ""what you gon' do?""
Temptation ain't motivation
This money could never make it better
Cadi cleaner than it'd don' ever been
But it's blood all on my wood and leather
Ain't no tellin' if I'ma get it right
Look to God up-under city lights
Pray to God, he wanted me to ball
Cuh being broke ain't really living life
People dying like every day
If I leave, tell 'em take care for me
If I ain't fit to see the sun again
Somebody say a prayer for me

If they kill me on Friday
Bury me on Sunday
Mourn for me Monday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
If they kill me on Tuesday
Bury me on Wednesday
Mourn for me Thursday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
'Cause Saturdays are for celebration

In the event of my demise I won't go kicking and screaming
I know that God had a reason, just don't give up believing
As long as the sun shines after the storm
So we don't cry at the dinner table
Rejoice and just be thankful
I made it, I'm home, sick of lyin', safe and sound
Battle with drinking so please don't pour me no liquor
Out on the curb, fight the urge to go retaliate
Carry on, just be strong enough to walk away
Uh, speak the truth even if they crucify me
Uh, free my soul even if they chain my body
Uh, look to God if ain't nowhere to go
Beware those prophets that touch a leg before they touch your soul
We reap what the sow when the boat man cometh
Gotta pay what we owe
Jesus walks so I run to him
How can they love me when I'm knowin' what they done to him

If they kill me on Friday
Bury me on Sunday
Mourn for me Monday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go
If they kill me on Tuesday
Bury me on Wednesday
Mourn for me Thursday
Then you gotta let me go, go
Then you gotta let me go

Mind Control,Cadillactica,2014,"Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's geeked and bound to let me tweak Her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind

M-I crooked, I was cooking up an old school
Sprinkled it with bad bitch, mixed it up with soul food
Put it on a plate with the bass and tweeters
For them haters, out here starvin', motherfucker I could feed ya
With some game, intergalactic, outer-space for brain
Chrome wheel in the water, might just get me in the summer
It look good don't it? Throw wood on it, with the golden vogue
Love potion on my mind, my pimpin' is an antidote
Cooley High, signing booming sign, knocking butters down
Crack the curb, like my ship emerged, from the underground
One more time, for them folks that know I be shinin'
Whippin' wind and reclining, pressin' diamonds
While I'm

Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's geeked and bound to let me tweak Her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind , her mind

I got armorall on my tongue, I talk slick
Catch a chick without using my hands, master manip
Sliding in my SLAB, slapping Big KRIT
Woofers in the back, tweeters in the lip
Push button secret stash spot for my yammer
Yammer mean yissle, pistol, or hammer
Blowing veggies, broccoli in the air
That's that Cali weed, I know that smell anywhere
Mind control, get in the female's head like a Tylenol
Body and soul, be about your brinead, increase your bankroll
Drink and cheefin', my and my heathens bustin' power moves
In the hood, like a mechanic, stickin' to the rules

Riding round so clean I let the bass beat out my speakers
Searching for a freak that's geeked and bound to let me tweak Her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind, her mind , her mind

On a mission, just me and Vincent
Your bitch might just come up missin' like the roof
Known to talk that player shit mama, that's just how I do
My old school look powder blue
We pulled up to the Papadeaux poundin'
Sat down, ordered the clam chowder
I had the lobster bisque
I'm what they talkin' 'bout if the topic is
Money, clothes, hoes, weed smoke
Take your panties off, you don't need those
Real niggas stay stuck to the G code
Never cheat, never off my feet
Never let these niggas see your weakness
If I eat then my niggas eat
Hit the weed then we hit the sheets
That be our little secret

Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
I'll remote control
Her mind, her mind
Round and round we go
Unlock and unload
I'll remote control

Life,Cadillactica,2014,"Transmission I miss my mark day one
I was so close to the sun, I burnt the top off my roof
I travelled a million miles to uncover what most would doubt
Although I believe in God, I need proof
I'm itching for conversation, answer if you can hear
Where you lost amongst shining stars?
Life can seem oh so clear, death can seem oh so near
Dodging these comets, I promise my baby I be back if I lose cons-(cuts off)
Tell her I love her, I miss her
I keep her picture upon my dash
And I wish her the best of luck, that's if I crash
I saw a flash just the other day while I was making haste
Could be reaching, but I found a beacon attention base
I get paranoid swerving around these asteroids
Lord forbid I have to abort my mission
But it gets hard when you searching in the dark
For that one and only spark
I think I see what's missing

I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life

I found life, in the darkest of times
How can I describe what's God's design
With these faulty eyes that often lie
Stars shine bright but they often die
I'm asking for permission to perceive
I'm closer than I've ever been
I probably shouldn't leave
I probably should record some of the things that I perceive
To be more sublime and divine than you and me

I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life
I found life
I found life
I found life upon this planet
Damnit, I've been damaged
But I I can manage
I won't take this for granted, life

Nah not yet
I'm ready to create now
Naah not yet, hold on
No, let's create now
Aight

Let's just take our time
Pretend like we started this
Pretend like we are creation
Pretend like it's all on us to be perfect
How about, let's just be perfect
And let us not pretend that we ain't made in God's images
Let's make good on these promises and be perfect
How about let's be perfect

These hands of mine can hold the weight of planets
Allow me to use the hues of lunar cools to paint a canvas
Of explosions and vibrant emotions that we know we could
Explore the outer most with no risks, even though we know we should
You are the ocean, I am a mountain
When a piece of me falls off in you there's no way of countin'
The days and times another you and me will arrive
But watch it grow to reach the sky
Emoted to be like  you and I
I hope it has your glowing eyes
The light, the dark
I won't refuse it love, instead I'll give it heart
Probably the same color as Mars
Was shining, blinding stars
To the fathers afar
Until it reaches God

Let's just take our time
Pretend like we started this
Pretend like we are creation
Pretend like it's all on us to be perfect
How about, let's just be perfect
And let us not pretend that we ain't made in God's images
Let's make good on these promises and be perfect
How about let's be perfect

I know what this means
You are all my sins
On this back seat car
Do it big, do me baby
I know what this means
You wanna be a star
Won't you Shake it for me, shake it for me baby
Do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Oooh do it like you love me, do it like you love me
Baby, baby, baby

Let's just take our time
Pretend like we started this
Pretend like we are creation

Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)

On the boulevard, oh my Lord
Her heels so high, she skipped the curb and ran in your yard
She's so, super fly
Crushed linen inside
This shit way too old, for me to drive
But I really don't care at all
She let me white her walls, and uh, pop her trunk
Turn her out, give her thump
Cause she need it
And she want it
There's no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real


Oh the boulevard, she go hard
No matter where and when, if I push her buttons she start
So, out of sight
Shawty cold as ice
Ain't no shame in her game, you just ain't her type
That ain't no lie at all
She creep and crawl
And without a stall or a pause, I break her off
Cause she need it and she want it
Theres no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real


Never ever have I ever seen a girl like you before
I love to hug onto your curves don't ever let me go
Hold on tight, I'll run the light, the peddle to the floor
And take us higher than we've ever been

Thought they wanted gold, thought they wanted shine
Thought they wanted radio, bitch make up your mind

All this attention, I don't even know what I might even do with it
That Control beat is like an ugly bitch that everybody done fucked raw
Maybe you hit it
Aww man, I'm more concerned why niggas been textin' my cell, callin' my phone
Ask me about this Kendrick shit, that he ain't even really even diss me on
I ain't drawn to all this propaganda, rap shit 'bout as real as Santa
Now I'm lyrical all of the sudden
Well last year they claim they ain't understand me
I'm buryin' niggas, and pissin' on they graves
Another nigga, other nigga name on your chain
And they call me a slave
Niggas scared of this country boy, lord forbid I catch a body
In the studio tryna calm your soul
Lookin' at your manager, I think Krizzle got me
I put you in the trunk with these subwoofers
5th wheel in my shottie
I'm so prolific with these scriptures they might give me a Bible
Page 1, come here son
Mind your manners, just be cool
I know you lame when you was in school
The little fame you ain't used to
And it was easy for you to move through
English class put you off a thesaurus
Like one of these days I'm gonna be a rapper
But all my verses gonna be borrowed
So I'ma take from all these Southern artists
That mainstream never heard of
Recycle all of they lingo
And make sure I screw my words up
Bravo for your swagger-jackin'
I'm overwhelmed by your dedication
You actually fooled these people into thinkin'
That your music was innovative
Frustrated
Rap battlin' never got me out of no public housin'
You tellin' me I can be King of Hip-Hop
And they wouldn't give it to Andre 3000?
Nigga please, this award ain't got shit to do with us
God could physically come down and say ""he the greatest
My favorite, y'all should listen, he have potential
To outlive the heatwave I'ma send through this motherfucker
And rebuild for a whole 'nother other culture""
And that wouldn't be enough
So fuck these haters and fuck these hoes
Damn right I still mean that

Hope the hook wasn't too simple
Either way nigga, I wrote it
Dahi made the beat, yes, I killed the track
I am far from wack, you a one-trick pony
I don't fall in line, I define what's rhyme
Fuck what you was thinkin', bloggers they can quote it
Lotta rappers buried underneath my house
They know what I'm 'bout, you ain't even know it
Overdosed on hocus-pocus, jibber-jabber
Snap on my stature was firebreathin' dragon
King of every castle, how you signin' rappers?
All these labels must be givin' out a raffle
Wranglin' like cattle, keep a nigga shackled
Leavin' people baffled, tap dance nigga
Misleadin' all of your rap fans, nigga
Might as well just do a lap dance, nigga
Sap ass nigga
Do whatever for some dap ass nigga
I ain't got time
To watch out for children, stay out my kitchen
The shit that I'm cookin' ain't meant for your kind
Crackin' and bashin' the shit out your spine
King with a crown, humble and tall
Tyrants never keep quiet, they'd rather be violent
So I'm beheading them all!
The lay of the land, I'm settin' fire to buildings and bridges
You ain't sell out a show until you sell out one in Mississippi
What’s good for Hip Hop may not be good for my soul
So, I keep flexin', wreckin', for the people that respect it
Check it, fuck a Control

Angels,Cadillactica,2014,"I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life
I think angels get high

When the sun goes down, heroes don't come outside
I seen too many villains provide
How can I choose a side to be on?
Tell a junkie be gone
Cause I don't push what he on or she on
Like before
Sometimes it's hard to pay the debt that you owe
Too much of something good will have you strung on the floor
Thunderstorms forever form outside my home
I swear these angels taking bong hits
I wonder if that flood that came through just because that left us on the curb was one of God's tears
To wash away the pain that we had
The house wasn't much, the neighborhood was bad
The basement won't save us but the prayers get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life
I think angels get high

Standing on the roof while helicopters swoop by
I think they don't see us
Not even FEMA could redeem the very faith we all lost
That made us once believers
Natural disasters bring us closer
My partner never prayed until he thought the world was over
2012, December 1st, he called me in a panic
He heard a storm was coming and it might destroy the planet, dammit
I called him back tomorrow because the boat I been paddling can't deal with so much sorrow
Borrowed time wasted
I probably shoulda played it safe instead of storm chasing
But the prayers will get us past
The rumbling and the thundering never last
So I ask, so I ask, so I ask

I think angels get high
Cause I can't describe all these clouds in the sky
I think God must have cried
Cause I can't describe all this rain in my life

Mo Better Cool,Cadillactica,2014,"Glisten like the sun off the candy
Got the tool in the dash, keep it handy
Jammin', up and down the boulevard, swang
Trunk still bangin', screens still hangin'
Old habits die hard, ain't shit changed
Bumping, still reclined, still swang and bang
Grippin' wood grain, grippin' wood grain

I remember when I used to roll
A bucket, no ducat to my name and my soul
Hoes used to front everywhere I go
But that's cool
Yea shit changed cause we on
Now I'm tailor made, choppin' blades and I'm grown
Now the same hoes won't leave me alone
But that's cool

So now usually I don't boast or brag
But, today different
Went from bucket, brake scrappin', to swinging like Kenny Griffey
I was scrawny than a motherfucker
When I was younger, got my weight up like a juggernaut
Now I'm solid wit' these numbers
Maxin' out on these hoes,Marinated my pimpin'
Cause when you season they peepin'
And scrape it right out the skillet
Got a vision for vixens, drop it low like the bass
Her pussy tighter than pliers that squeeze the wine outta grapes
So I hit it slow
Flea flicker, give and go
I know that the shine the only reason she kick it for
I went from not a thing, to a Caddy frame, throw it off in the game
When you came and you got changed, shit can't be the same
So I'm chillin', bumpin', grillin'
Hollin' out fuck the feeling's of critics
That claim they come from slums but they from the village for real
Cause while these lames sittin' still
I hit the road, broke the mold, and came up on a mil
BITCH!

I remember when I used to roll
A bucket, no ducat to my name and my soul
Hoes used to front everywhere I go
But that's cool
Yea shit changed cause we on
Now I'm tailor made, choppin' blades and I'm grown
Now the same hoes won't leave me alone
But that's cool

Man I was a wild motherfucker, back when I was round 20
Fuck niggas nah you wouldn't find me round any
Rollin' one deep in the Buick Park Ave
With a sawed off shotgun that cut your ass in half
Laughin' at these niggas that was hatin' on the low
Cause on the cool, I was puttin' dick off in they ho
And on the cut, you couldn't short stop me for the blow
Cause I be with the pistol, knockin' on your front door
See where I come from, you can't just tell me that you hard
Niggas'll come and box you up in your front yard
Betta' to not talk about pullin' out the GAT
Cause on sight we put that 9 milli to yah' hat
Now as I got older, my rep got colder
These niggas wouldn't dare to knock the chip up off my shoulder
Certified soldier with the stripes that'll prove it
I got my reputation in the streets, fuck the music

I remember when I used to roll
A bucket, no ducat to my name and my soul
Hoes used to front everywhere I go
But that's cool
Yea shit changed cause we on
Now I'm tailor made, choppin' blades and I'm grown
Now the same hoes won't leave me alone
But that's cool

Yea! Reporting live from the ceiling, enjoy the view bitch
Sho' gone make a killin', ain't nothin' new bitch
Cept' the pressure from the  hecklers checkin' from the nosebleeds
Ho please, I can't even see you from my flo' seats
The boy came to play and no this ain't a game
Dunkin', trunkin, thumpin' purple colored gators mayne
Hold up, this win is on us
It's a celebration, bitch, every time I show up
Get in the way, get swole up
That's no luck for anyone tryna outshine us
Plenty of haters that couldn't get haters are heard steppin' behind us
Better catch on to our coattails, I boast well, while I shit talk
That bullshit we don't let walk
Cripple their chances, cripple advances, stickin' the landin'
Then I, jumped up off the porch wit'
All of this dough that I'm gone get
Respect that or get yo' dome split
And on it I stay, no reprieve for no punk
Consider your ship sunk, I'm just bein' Big Sant bitch

Dodging the sun, watching for shade
Playing the game, catching the fade
Doing what it takes to find a hole in this maze
Frankie Beverly melody in the tape deck and checkin' in the mirror for them ho laws
Tryna reach a quota so they so called
Control the atmosphere that I bogart
Good Lord, the streets ain't safe no more, I heard
From a little bird that always strolled those curbs
In the darkest alley where first come, first serve
The right time, the night time for her
But the day time's blurred
I knew her since the first grade, she was fast
I guess she never let up on the gas
Least but no least, she had me for some cash
The love of my life's now a ghost in the past
Crash landed in the worst place
I guess for some folk, everyday ain't they birthday
We ain't talkin' car if we asking mercy
You  think she wanna fuck? What if she really thirsty?
Holy water, mama daughter
I keep a shoulder
For them to cry on
Cause even the strong need someone to rely on
In these turbulent times, we got to fly on

Bravo for your swagger-jackin'
I'm overwhelmed by your dedication
You actually fooled these people into thinkin'
That your music was innovative
Frustrated, rap battlin' never got me out of no public housin'
You tellin' me I can be King of Hip-Hop
And they wouldn't give it to Andre 3000?
Nigga, please, this award ain't got shit to do with us
God could physically come down and say ""He the greatest
My favorite, y'all should listen, he have potential
To outlive the heatwave I'ma send through this motherfucker
And rebuild for a whole 'nother other culture""
And that wouldn't be enough
So fuck these haters and fuck these hoes
Damn right, I still mean that

Now they wanna hear a country nigga rap
Five albums in, I swear a country nigga snap
Thought they wanted trap (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted bass (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted molly (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted drank, fuck them niggas
Now they wanna hear a country nigga rap
Five albums in, I swear a country nigga snap
Thought they wanted gold (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted shine (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted radio (yeah ho)
Bitch make up your mind

Hope the hook wasn't too simple
Either way nigga, I wrote it
Yes, I made the beat, yes, I mixed the track
I am far from wack, you a one-trick pony
I don't fall in line, I define what's rhyme
Fuck what you was thinkin', bloggers they can quote it
Lotta rappers buried underneath my house
They know what I'm 'bout, you ain't even know it
Overdosed on hocus-pocus, jibber-jabber
Snap on my stature was firebreathin' dragon
King of every castle, how you signin' rappers?
All these labels must be givin' out a raffle
Wranglin' like cattle, keep a nigga shackled
Leavin' people baffled, tap dance nigga
Misleadin' all of your rap fans, nigga
Might as well just do a lap dance, nigga
Sap ass nigga
Do whatever for some dap ass nigga
I ain't got time
To watch out for children, stay out my kitchen
The shit that I'm cookin' ain't meant for your kind
Crackin' and bashin' the shit out your spine
King with a crown, humble and tall
Tyrants never keep quiet, they'd rather be violent
So I'm beheading them all
The lay of the land, I'm settin' fire to buildings and bridges
You ain't sell out a show until you sell out one in Mississippi
What’s good for hip-hop may not be good for my soul
So, I keep flexin', wreckin', for the people that respect it
Check it, 
fuck your Control
(Are you not entertained!)
Bih!

Now they wanna hear a country nigga rap
Five albums in, I swear a country nigga snap
Thought they wanted trap (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted bass (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted molly (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted drank, fuck them niggas
Now they wanna hear a country nigga rap
Five albums in, I swear a country nigga snap
Thought they wanted gold (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted shine (yeah ho)
Thought they wanted radio (yeah ho)
Bitch make up your mind, fuck them niggas!

Fuck them niggas!
Yea, I said it, fuck them niggas!
Yea, I said it, fuck them niggas!
Yea, I said it, thought they wanted radio, bitch make up your mind
Fuck them niggas!",https://genius.com/Big-krit-mt-olympus-lyrics

Twistin', turnin', my mind blown and her mind gone

Face right, stage lights turn her out
Act like she the only one in here
That can twerk for real and that's without a doubt

Ya make it hard for me just to roll up and roll out
To be honest
You the type of chick a nigga search for when he have to go out
Spotlight, night life, live in V.I. every weekend
I ain't trippin' on a busta that really ain't nothin'
I'm hopin' you down for the creepin'

What’s Next,See Me On Top IV,2014,"I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready cuz, some days and sometimes, it's harder than it's ever been before
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready cuz, some days and sometimes, it's easier if I just let go

My partner hit me one time
Said he felt like killing himself
Ain't much that I could say to him
Except I understood how he felt
It's more to life than drug money
It's more to life than cars and clothes
But when you raised in the wild as a child with the lions and hunters that's all you know
We caught up in a whirlwind of bullshit
That's why it's hard to hear the pastor in the pulpit
That's why these youngsters down to rumble on the corner over numbers with the lumber and they ain't scared to pull it
I thought there was a calm after the storm
Its been category five since I was born
I'm losing friends everyday over strays
It's getting hard to mourn


My home girl hit me one time, she 'bout to sell her body for change
Ain't much that I can say to her, I guess that's just a part of the game
There's more to life than fly bags, there's more to life than diamonds and pearls
But when you raised without a father and your mother never bothered, it's hard to stay a little girl
She caught up in a whirlwind of stage lights
She'll do whatever that you ask her if the pays right
Get a lover with no rubber cuz he claimed that he was clean, now she know what having AIDS like
I thought there was a calm after the storm
It's been a category five since she was born

Creeping like caterpillar, shoes and belts made of lizard
Tweeters, speakers, and kickers
Flow colder than blizzard
Shine brighter than nova, so mother fuck your flicker
I play to the grizzle, that's the bone for you city folk
Give it all I got, pushing chrome with a city ho
Putting on my friends and my kin, hollerin' Multi!
Rep it til the end we gonna win til the sun die
Tell them haters that, now tell them haters this
Instead of jocking mine, go get your own shit
I battle through the buzzard and the cluckers on that fuck shit

Now I ain't no chump, I'm known for flowing proper
She bopped off my top you blocked and tried to stop her
Yall flex don't even fakes with chrome and candy paint
You thought that shit could float on it's own but that shit sank
Mister sucka ducket, If you lucky she'll let you finger fuck it
You cuff or buss it, I stretch that pussy like Kangol buckets
Your game too rusty, my game was polished to play a primp
Not even them gators or suits to tailor could save a simp
From a flame spitter, lame nigga
Never had a chance
Break his bitch and the bitch that came with her
And ride off like a thief in the night
Ain't no sense in doing shit if you ain't dying to do it right

Truck shaking like a nympho

But I know they fit

That's too poor to come up there
But we knocking doors, off the hinges
Tryna stay one with ourselves, and not these 
prisoners
That AK say I can go anywhere, without a lintian
Don't let these old Versace lenses, cloud your vision
Along with smoke and mirrors

I had to take a breath and chill on it
I got some Soul that's if you still want it
Down home, country shit
Bitch yeah I'm still on it
You might have bit a style or two, but ain't no skill on it
It ain't jumping out the gym if there ain't no rims on it
Candy paint ain't poppin' enough that you can throw some rim on it
Say you got that 
Ghetty Green
, why you sprinkle stims on it?
Yeah I got family to feed, suggest you throw some M's on it
Trim on it, money trees need water to grow some  on it
Buy a house, two or three and let my mama live on it
So I can break bread with my partners, contrary to popular belief they tired of toting choppers cause


How many blunts you plan to smoke today?
How many drinks you need to stop the shakes?
I know the feeling when the ceiling's the only thing to watch
And it's either gas your car or buy food for your spot
8 'O clock, on the dot, they call you for them bills
Sallie Mae don't give a fuck, that's how you know shit's real
So we comply, getting by is hard enough
Them law know what you sellin' cause they ain't that far from you
Stake they two damn cars from ya
And them junkies be 
Just the P will cost you re-up so you hustlin' for nothing
Wanna leave but all your people hold you back cause they struggling
So you feeling like fuck it, another crab in the bucket


Gravity can't hold us, if you judging by my colors
Then you don't really know me, if you ain't at all love
Then what you trying to show me
Another car, another crib, another deal, another Rolley
Cause I done seen it all and
That's not a reflection of, what I'm meant to be
It's monetary at the less so

Pockets low shit
To all the mothafuckas out here on that ho shit

To bumming rides
Taking chances, riding dirty to survive

Hoping God can throw a good son a blessing
Cause going two days without eating just ain't healthy
Sitting in this four corner room, consuming all my doubts
Eviction notice been due, they bound to kick us out
Cop a room for the night, deep off in the drought
I'm too grown to be on grandma's couch


Where they left me at?
Out here for the wolves
When you hustle just to scrape for change, hard to play it cool
Now it's Louis loafers, all on your sofa, like, 'fuck this couch'
Went from crinkled dollars to banding benjis and large amounts
Let's say, pray over this cake we cutting
Been on my grown man shit since ladies 
I rest on a cot, they see a lock
I touch down in every spot
It takes a vacay just to shop
She bougie, only seen the type of shit in the movie
Live the type of life you wish that you knew me
Grew up rocking Gibraltar, white tees, bubble toes, and Pumas
Now it's  stock


To folding clothes, at clothing stores, for $5.84
To pay bills and work some more on the daily
Na, baby, no party for my b-day
I'm sorry I can't be there
I'm out here chasing payment
Lately my heart been aching
I feel like I should do better
The world we in gets colder and colder
Go get my sweater and bundle up
Summer just ain't warm enough to heat the souls of many
I'm out here scraping pennies
Pray the crooked law don't sentence me to death
With my hands up, hard to pull my pants up
Running for dear life while I'm jammed up
Slammed and mishandled 'em
Police there
 
cameras while media Wikipedia me to be a vandal
Memories of energy flow through my burned candles
On the corner 'till the wind blow
I wrote that bar for all my dope selling kin folk
Risk taking everyday
I pray that y'all settle down, get married, find a wife, then throw a bouquet, have kids, and be safe
And teach 'em what our parents didn't teach us
The music just don't reach 'em like it reach us
So now it's on us to be the leaders

Got nowhere to go
I'm out in smoke

Cl-cl-club jumping, late night on the creep
Ain't nowhere to be
Push a ham sandwich on them peas
Searching for the cheese with a flashlight
Damn I gotta get this act right
Hear my partner bout this boppa that was boppin
But what her ass like?
That shawty, she was that shawty back in High School
Grew up to be fly, when them buss-its used to slide through
Remember little devil that used to hang out with your sister?
Yeah she a bad mother fucker
Plus I heard that she a stripper
Check her Instagram pictures
Yeah she twerking at the shake junt
Now she down for cutting just for showing his 808's thump
I know, people don't dance no more
But when she on that pole
To be honest she can go
Make me throw a little bit more
Than a playa probably should have
There's a thin line between trickin' and woulda, coulda..
Fucked her, if I had a chance
But all she did was stack the money
Thank me for the bands

Still solo dolo at the corner store
Leaning on my whip like I got vertigo
Screening for them laws
That just stress you cause when you trying to get it in some
That when they catch you on a lonely night, super quiet
My eyes wide shut, to my surprise
Picked up birds with plenty feathers with my eagle eye
Bonafide, the ass fatter than Pirelli tires
Let me reside in your domicile

I said that under my breath, but
She preceded to walk over to me like you gon' step, huh
I said yeah cuz, you ain't wait your man
It's 3 in the morning, you look lonely, help me understand

You know what I'm saying, it was music, it was people that had ear to the street, it was people that wanted to spread the word about what I was rapping about, about the content. And at the end of the day, I was always gonna keep it one hundred and I did that with Live At The Underground.

I'ma hit it from the front, I'ma hit it from the back, 
bust it like a gat, pat pat
Kissin' party with a couple bad bitches, gettin' dirty with all of my niggas
Feelin' woozy but I'm pourin' more liquor
But the cutie booty couldn't be bigger
I'm celebratin' cause we shouldn't be here
Hella faded cause the Hennessy near
Dedicated to all of my peers, A$AP, the vision so clear
I can see you haters from here, I can spot you out of my chair
My throne, you won't come near, the microphone is on fire
The booth is Roman, I'm sire, I'm king of this shit, I'm no liar
I'm droppin' careys, Mariah, got the grip on the game like I'm pliers

Lac, Lac, Lac, Lac, Lac
Slammin' the doors in the
Pull up with hoes in the
Diamond in the back, they chosen, uh, posted up
Pourin' up

Hold it up, be a soldier don't be closin' up

Open your mind, (open your mind, open your, open your mind)
Open your mind, (open your mind, open your, open your mind) Open your mind
This could be the day

Niggas talk that big shit nowadays
But they muscles ain't strong enough
Niggas claim they change the game
Catalogs ain't long enough
Slow motion, I'm still posted
In the cut, been waitin' my turn
Fell off cause you wasn't yourself
Oh well, nigga live and you learn
Money don't concern me, I was too determined
Fuck what you heard, I feed my fam
I put on for mine, I let my brother shine
And I be comin' down like goddamn
We made it, that check on me, my nigga
For what it's worth, I don't go to work
So this verse ain't free, my nigga
This work ain't free, my nigga
Yeah it's above average cause they're raisin' taxes
Dropped twelve albums, that's a grand apiece
And plus I made the beats, you do the mathematics
No watches, no dope money, I'm just Southern
One of the coldest niggas that's in the game
And I've only been on one major cover, like damn
Either they don't know, they don't show
Or they don't care what happens in the South
Or either I'm too smart, or they too dumb
To know what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout when I say

Conscious Effort Freestyle,Week of K.R.I.T. ,2014,"Early like the mornin', yawnin', wipe the crust from my third eye
To peep the true intentions of buzzards
Flock and chirp like they're lovers, but pull their talons in public
Scratch you out like the lotto, these niggas hoes for the ducket's, I swear
Cause money make niggas change like dollar bills
Seen it once or twice, nigga blocked your life, that shit for real
Brutus came through thrice and he murked out Caesar after all them years
Now what makes you think your shit don't stink and you won't get killed
Cause always someone riding, rolling their eyes
At the fact I'm a king and I'm so modest about my rivalries from
Other kingdoms, it's such an oddity that being humble could be a sign of weakness
When they know that I know that I body them so
Why waste the cavalry? No need for casualties
When niggas know that their time is up, like what the fuck they rhymin' for?
What these labels signing for? It's hard to find it comical
Cause this ain't Saturday Night Live, no adlib, no high five, just chess moves
I wreck that shit, never peck that shit, bitch, how dare you?
I'm my only competition, there's no one else to compare to
Unless it's Zeus or Thor
Or a mystical creature that only eat beats and emcees so feed me more
I wonder if all this hard work really gonna pay up
While laying up in the villa with broads that's dying for me to slay on
Not even tripping on blog sites 'cuz they draw light to them haters
Could let a nigga tell it, them niggas is jealous comment on my flavors
Favors, shit I don't do them hoes lately
Big frontyard, big backyard, have 'em send smoke signals to my neighbors
Got a driveway around my way, you a quarterback throwing papers
I ain't worried 'bout no jack boy, these white folks pullin' capers
Where I stay and I bet they think I'm a dopeboy
Cause I walk that way, and I talk that way to them folk boy
Sit my rims on the curb, Captain Phillips couldn't sail where I float, boy
Was a hustler at birth, I could sell Mr. Clean some soap boy
Been a while since I feel like talking that shit
Over-confident, common sense, commonly that we get
Honesty is a commodity, similes ain't my shit
I could say it's popping for sure, you probably think I'm frying fish
Maybe I was, ho
Cause dropping a boombox in your bathtub was the only way you could buzz mo'
And yeah, that's cutthroat
But it's slice her neck or cut a check
It ain't my shit if It ain't wrecked
It must be y'alls if it was stepped on
Yo bitch a freak, fucked her to sleep
And that was the last time I was slept on
Shit, I woke up and fucked her again so she ain't sleep long, nigga",https://genius.com/Big-krit-conscious-effort-freestyle-lyrics
Egyptian Cotton,Week of K.R.I.T. ,2014,"I'm out in Sweden this evening, Stockholm this summer
Champagning with pretty models that pose while they slumber
You have to see to believe it, Eiffel my tower
A long way from that bopper house, game playing there for hours
That was breakfast in bed, too high up to be scared
No key card, you a fraud, ain't no taking the stairs
Complimentary the emphasis on compliments
I really didn't need a suite, but the view beneath is ambient
Honestly, I'm really at a lost of words
300 block to seeing half the world
From the slumest of conditions to living in the 'burbs
Niggas claim they selling out, but that sound so absurd
Cause wasn't we younguns watching the cars pass by, like ""That's mine""?
Visit my father's friends on Christmas like they rich and we not
They had a pyramid of presents, stacked 'em up to the top
Get back home like, ""Damn, Zac, I think this is all that we got""
No disrespect to my pops, Winn-Dixie just wasn’t paying
My mama did what she could, as a kid I heard patience was a virtue
On the first day of school those last year shoes, could hurt you
Stains on those Paco jeans belong on Tide commercials
So they talk and they laugh, I swore I’d get back
Now them double RL’s is hard and my G-Star’s they got slack
And we grown, those dead stock J's, I had them flown
Didn't even put 'em on, ain't nothing set in stone
Only Egyptian cotton

Life could be as smooth as Egyptian cotton
Life should be as cool as Egyptian cotton
I can't seem to lose on Egyptian cotton
Falling to the grooves of Egyptian cotton

It's getting harder not to sleep in
When every day is the first day of a well-deserved weekend
I halt the sun in my blind so it won't peek in
Then roll over on the damsel down for freakin'
Room service replenished, energy needed
She opened the door and she barely decent
Ass out, I dig her like, ""Who gon' stop us now?""
I might not see her again, let's go another round
That's how it is when you come and go
That's how it is when we come and go
That phrase never meant so much to me before
Now, as it stands, it's the only motto that I know
Dad ain't get money, but we do that
Private jets first class, I been flew that
Who that trying to sum up my success?
It's like sleeping on the best, Egyptian cotton",https://genius.com/Big-krit-egyptian-cotton-lyrics

All I want is that lemon pepper, but the flavors vary
Got head in Paris, my AP canaries
See me on that cover of Rolling Stone's embellished
Diamonds drip from my neck, them tats all on my belly
All I had was that dream, Martin Luther my king
And one last request: bury me in my rings


Pardon if it’s much
Diamonds in the back seat will surely crush
Fishbone the dash, roll around on glass
You talkin' too much
Takes a lot of shine just to Supernova
You don’t know my kind
I don’t play with kids, bitch I play for keeps
If you don’t know I’m with it then you don’t know the shine
Take that with a grain of salt, I don’t give a fuck about it
Treat the pussy the gold if she down
Then swoll, then she bound to squeeze a buck up out it

Catch me at Pappadeaux cracking crab and peeling shrimp
Nigga, wait your turn, fly a plane or catch a blimp
Sideways sitting, bubble eye blade chipping off the corners that I bend
On some 20-20 twins,
 
watch your mouth
We don't play with children 'round these parts
Even titans kill Gods,
 
you ain't eating then you starve
I ain't fucking with no sobs, dem broads and petty frauds
It's hard talking bars, good Lord won't get you far
These days and times I raise the ways of rhymes
Nigga, fuck that bullshit you could cut cocaine with mine
Pyrex flow,
 my exo-skeleton heaven sent
Heavy as cement sediments walked only by elephants
Ever since I was 7 pounds it was evident
That a legend I was meant to be and everything else is irrelevant
Selfishly, king remember in time I coined that phrase
You could never be the same because you ain't got no change
Baby steps, nigga


Done Dap writer, tight rope walker
Big top 10 Giant, I hope you all watchin'

Defeat my competition landslide style, fuck an undecided

I push on my opponents cause fronting I don't condone it
Bitch, you better get a grip, better yet get a gip
Life is short, the good die, mostly over bullshit
And that bullshit costs
You working for a worker, walking 'round holling ''boss''
Talking 'bout you're blood, but your lights cutting out
Tough luck cuz, hope you gotta plan B 
Ya'll boys got the game lopsided, you don't walk polished
Parachuting off your palm pilot
Is you seeking or reaching? Either way better stretch for it
Upside down, look what I rep ho

Grand scheme, damn fiends

She Kills Me,All My Life ,2015,"There she is, and I can't let her go
She's so fly, and she's so sexual
It gets me off when she walk
Lick her lips when she talk
She kills me, she kills me
Murda, murda

It all started out in Brook' here late one evening
One homeboy' girlfriend wanted me to meet her
Then she told me she could turn any man into a cheater
Real thick on the bottom, with some model-type features
Really light skinned, and they called her senorita
Both parents black, but still she a keeper
Make a million and spend all of his cash
Long black hair hang down to her ass
Walked up to us like how ya'll doin'?
Eyes on me so I'm knowin' she choosin'
Really couldn't picture how she looked till' I seen her
Face like feed her, body like Trina
Sorta like delicious, or maybe much meaner
If this is about grass, over there is much greener
She dipped, I caught a glimpse of her ass as she was leaving
I knew she was a killer, almost stopped me from breathin'

There she is, and I can't let her go
She's so fly, and she's so sexual
It gets me off when she walk
Lick her lips when she talk
She kills me, she kills me
Murda, murda

Late one night, got a couple calls like
""I ain't ever ever seen this number""
Shawty on the other end like
""It would be a shame if we never got to know each other""
Really hate to wonder, If I got a girlfriend
And if I'm gon' be real with her, If so head to the club and come and chill wit' her
I got fresh to death to jump playa's
Got my HB's on not to see these haters
Valet my car and I head to the front
She waiting outside when a playa rolled up
Face so legit, ass hard to miss
People stop to stare, skirt barely there
All the other shawtys hating how she grind on me
And all the other fellas wishing she would grind on em'
She lit up the club every time the lights hit her
It was murder she wrote, she's a serial killer

There she is, and I can't let her go
She's so fly, and she's so sexual
It gets me off when she walk
Lick her lips when she talk
She kills me, she kills me
Murda, murda

After the club, in my spot she'd sit
She wanna let her hair blow out the top, she said
If I was a store, she would shop, she said
Want me to take her straight to the top, she said
That's the grey goose talkin' and them shots of tequila
She said that's just a little way of sayin' I could meet her
And she a killer and I know she gon' fight for it
Do it till' she can't stand, yeah I think she liked it
So bad, can't help but to do it
Make her cum so hard, can't help but to lose it
Like a scene out a movie or a old school poet
Got my tool on deck and I'm searching for the killer (for the killer)

There she is, and I can't let her go
She's so fly, and she's so sexual
It gets me off when she walk
Lick her lips when she talk

To leave you at the crib, just to try to chase this game

Cause we gone go do better
If I ain't go do better  for us
I can't talk right now, cause they charging by the hour
I'm at the io
Yeah, but did you get them flowers that I sent to you
For being there and sticking by your man
These snakes is running game, but they ain't getting by your man
So stop it, keep it hot for me
And all that love that we had
When we first met, I hope that it don't stop for me
I think this rap about to pop for me
So if I can get you that house you wanted, that car
And hell, I'll even let you shop for me
Tell your folk they ain't gotta trip
Cause when they hear my music

But you gone see that your family say I'm gone leave you
Once I made it, I can hear that doubtin' in your voice
And yeah I hate it, I'm coming home soon shawty
So just be patient
And we gone kick it like we never kicked it
And that's a bet
We gone live like the happy live, with no regrets
So stay down, I know just how we play round
And when you (?) when we lay down
When I hit this road, and rock all of these shows
I can look you in the eyes and know you still love me
And when I come back home
And take you to this house that the rap game bought
I know you proud of me
And I ain't saying that we ain't about to go through it
With the magazines, tabloids, haters and the rumors
But yet, I'm just a man
I hope you understand, that this gone be hard

The Maybach with the chauffeur
Red carpet when we roll up
The doors on the whip like wings, they just roll up
You always kept me focused
That why I hope you closest
I did it all for us
And I'm hoping that you noticed

Sky Mad at Me,All My Life ,2015,"I promise that I'm gon' make it through
Look at myself in the mirror, like ""this ain't it for you""
I hear my momma holler out, ""baby, come eat your food""
Don't know the more time I waste, the more dough I lose
They laugh at me. I guess I'm accustomed to this feeling
They called it country, but hell, that's just how we be living
Another dream, another scheme just to make a dollar
No fancy cars or clothes, but shawty's still holler
No crystal in the crib, but we be poppin' bottles
Grey goose'll get ya loose,
 no more than a hundred dollars
I'm on my porch and I'm thinking 'bout my past life
Hopin' that all my troubles are over once my cash right, maybe not
Think of the world like a hood you can't drive through
Wish it was simpler like back in high school
When those books was the only thing you abide to
And lord, I was just wondering, what did I do to the sky?

This life and time I don't care
Most of my life I blew smoke in the air
(I think the sky mad at me)
Because I know It ain't the limit
And outer space is where I'm going when I'm finished
(I think the sky mad at me)
Cause I don't tell it that it's lovely
I think it put the storm clouds above me
(I think the sky mad at me)
When it rains on my head, duck it
But I'm not hot enough to touch it
(I think the sky mad at me)

Maybe it ain't all bad
Keep myself smilin', looking towards the sun like it ain't all sad
I gotta get out on my own and build a shelter
Where honor ain't my girl, I'm without an umbrella
And it's raining. My Cadillac ain't swanging
My rims ain't big enough, and my people keep complaining
They thinking that I'm changing. I'm thinking I might fail
I'm grinding in this flood and these haters drop as hail
The weatherman funny. He claiming that it's sunny
We don't have a magic city, so it never rains money
And hurricanes comin'. I swear that I can feel it
Grab a towel and bucket 'cause there's holes in my ceillin'
I know that this ain't livin'. Yeah heaven's gon' be better
The more I shoot for good, It's like the rain makes me wetter
I know this ain't forever, so watch me make it mine
And lord, I was just wondering, what did I do to the sky?

This life and time I don't care
Most of my life I blew smoke in the air
(I think the sky mad at me)
Because I know It ain't the limit
And outer space is where I'm going when I'm finished
(I think the sky mad at me)
Cause I don't tell it that it's lovely
I think it put the storm clouds above me
(I think the sky mad at me)
When it rains on my head, duck it
But I'm not hot enough to touch it
(I think the sky mad at me)

I think I smoked just a little too much, and now I'm outta my mind
(I'm outta my mind, yeah)
Cause I've been spending my days in the clouds, and baby, I wanna fly (I wanna fly, yeah)
And now my folks say I'm dreaming too much, and I'm wasting my time (wasting my time)
But I'm just tryna' make some sense out my life, so since I'm alive, that's why I stay high

This life and time I don't care
Most of my life I blew smoke in the air
(I think the sky mad at me)
Because I know It ain't the limit
And outer space is where I'm going when I'm finished

Cause I don't tell it that it's lovely

Here We Go,All My Life ,2015,"Here we go
Thank God for the summertime
It’s like he did it just so I can shine
I get to it like it’s overtime
It’s all work no play, I’m out in here like  yesterday
Thank God for the old school
Gotta choose it when I roll through
I give it to you like I owe you
It’s all work no play, I’m out in here like  yesterday

I’m fresh (yeah)
And now they looking at me funny
Like a hustler ain’t supposed to get money (real shit)
We born and bred
Where the same place you lay is
Prolly the same place that you dig
How come they wanna see me fall in a hail of gunshots?
I can comprehend
But when come around they close mouth
Like you can’t literally hear a fucking pin (ya heard that)
Drop
How's life?
My aura's some of that blueberry bubblegum kush purple hazel
FInally, they wanna hear something real so we can leave ’em waiting
Here we go

Here we go
Thank God for the summertime
It’s like he did it just so I can shine
I get to it like it’s overtime

Thank God for the old school
Gotta choose it when I roll through
I give it to you like I owe you
It’s all work no play, I’m out in here like  yesterday

I daydream about cash while wake up
I’m sweet sixteen welcome home brother cake up
Like an abusive father, that’s how I shake up the game
So they respect the name Young Krizzle (Young Krizzle)
Creatively moving, world pursuing
My father raised me but I was Pac influenced
This is my movie, roll, camera, action
No script or rehearsal kinda like ad-lib me (hear me)
I’m so fresh to death I’m past living
The way I ghostwrite on the track I’m past killing
I grow up in a flow I’m past being
On top of that, I’m from Mississippi

Here we go
Thank God for the summertime
It’s like he did it just so I can shine
I get to it like it’s overtime
It’s all work no play, I’m out in here like  yesterday
Thank God for the old school
Gotta choose it when I roll through
I give it to you like I owe you
It’s all work no play, I’m out in here like  yesterday

I turned a hater into a believer
I’m the one that they pay to see, yeah (see yeah)
I break bread with the hood ‘cause the hood’s been good to me, yeah
Now it’s the time re-up (here we go)
Me and my people just (?) and we gon' pop
And when they gettin' rough, we won't stop
So I'ma keep busting until the beat drop until I’m on top

Sky Line,All My Life ,2015,"We can wake up in the morning
Look out the window, see a different skyline (skyline)
We can wake up in the morning
Goodbye, time to see a different skyline (skyline)

I wake up, breathe out
Stretch my arms and peek out
The window of my beach house
I'm so fly, I could leap out
I ball hard just to rebound
Grab a bad chick while another leave out
She understands so I never have to creep out
The type of chick that get a chick while we be out
I'm rockstar in this, something foreign
Bugatti today, tomorrow Aston Martin
If I fall short, It's the Lambo
Forces on the streets of Italy, no sandals
While people in the states is stressin'
I'm probably somewhere in Venice, wine testin'
Flow grater shit, breadmaker
Meet a dime chick, the Da Vinci Code-breaker

We can wake up in the morning
Look out the window, see a different skyline (skyline)
We can wake up in the morning
Goodbye, time to see a different skyline (skyline)

Check me out
No consequences, we fly
Buckle up, baby girl, let's get high
I'm g5-in', sky linin'
Kick it with the natives on the local islands
I hit the strip in designer themes
Sundown, we dine on exotic cuisines
A young playa and ya know that
Unless ya want anotha' chance don't blow that
So fresh I be, no mess I be, you're the same if you're beside me
I came for a run like H-O-V
So water with the flow, call me tsunami
They know just who I be, young B-I-G K-R-I-T
M-I, crooked letter, crooked letter
See a different skyline, like we gettin' cheddar

We can wake up in the morning
Look out the window, see a different skyline (skyline)
We can wake up in the morning
Goodbye, time to see a different skyline (skyline)

It's wintertime and the grass still green
Come see a view that just oh so mean
And don't trip, cause' the tabs on me
Everything's for free when you on my time
You must be a catch when you on my line
You call it paradise, but I'm on my grind
I do it big 'cause I gotta
If not me, who's hotter?
Yeah the fly senorita, like ""oh Papi!""
Out in China they Hollar 
I'm the big kahuna down in Waikiki
The same place that I'm chillin' usually on TV
And you can go if you want to
As a guide, ain't no tellin' what we gon' do
Every day, new place, new scene
Let's treat tonight like a dream
And

We can wake up in the morning
Look out the window, see a different skyline (skyline)

King Pt. 4,It’s Better This Way,2015,"Let's go, K.R.I.T
See when it comes to god given talent
And whenever form is given
Most of us learn our journey at a early age
Sometimes the worlds teaching
Guides us to the highest path
Other times, the teacher negates our gifts
And blocks the shine
I'm here to tell you
When you're destined for greatness
No roadblock can stop that journey
Don't follow the leaders, be the leaders

I was prepared for the worst
Dug in deep, cause I emerged from the dirt
My nigga said ""You ain't the only one""
But in truth, you got to be the first
Cause you can see the good and the bad
And you'll turn down the bad
That's a gift and a curse
I envy your will to be a better man
In a world where a better man don't even stand a chance on this earth
Bible talk, they told me that I can keep that
This time I'll leave the sheep where the sheep at
And I pray that when the wolves fall through
Their stomach still full, so they won't eat that
Which is mine? I really think I'm wasting time
Worried 'bout my people and all they sayin'
Fuck me cause I was too determined to ball
But if you knew that you could fly, nigga why did you fall?
I'm feeling like LeBron more than ever
They givin' nigga the praise, but I'm knowing that I'm better
So, fuck a ring if it don't make me a great
Why you doing too much? I'ma do what it takes
I got a chip on my shoulder the size of a boulder
That a giant wouldn't even bother to hold up
Like, Krizzle why you carrying this?
Cause it ain't enough soil I can bury it with
And it ain't enough weight, that's the scariest shit
That means I was built for more, trial and error
Almost burst into tears when I saw my brother's kids
Like I coulda have this, I gotta keep it together
But I've been chasing, way too much chasing
They'll never give me what I deserve, just face it
Fuck faking, fuck pretending like you know my story
Or what it's like to be mistaken as a basic
Country bumpkin, watermelon
Chicken-eatin', collard greens
Neckbone chillin' motherfucker
We’re the butt of all jokes grew up here
And we'll show you have no clue of what it's like to be southern
Knowing you a king and in spite all you dream
Had to be a nightmare for you to wake up
And those two hour meetings 
with the label betting money on
Another excuse that they'll scrape up
For me to do it out of pleasure, another pay cut
And they wonder why a nigga never say much
I never was the begging type
I couldn't picture this shit, I never cared for likes
I never cared for what your opinion would be
And even if I did, nigga shame on me
I live my life, a hundred fucking miles and running
Only for a nigga to sit and try to tell me something about the music
Culture, consumer, vultures
The music that I make ain't for radio, bogus
The people just wanna hit the club and have fun
And I don't make that kind of shit and that's really the culprit
Art is art no matter how you sculpt it
Mold it, grow it, only to go unnoticed
Cause nowadays we just focus on them thots
And niggas selling kool aid on a soapbox
I'm imprisoned to my mission, screaming listen
Lord I wish I could stop
I wish I could tell them 'bout the book
But they caught up in the movie, lights and the props
The pyro, and the award shows and the fancy clothes
And well-offs, extorting the have nots
Man, fuck this shit

You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon' change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way
Better this way
It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play

It’s that, It’s that Krit remind you of that shit
You used to play
In your parents car
Had you feel in as if outer space
Was in your atmosphere
ATLiens all in your ear
Tired of being outcasted
I hope 
that means
 you outta here
Nowadays we flex so much
Get a check so much
We never chill
Way to drunk to drive
High as fuck
Plus we poppin pills
Celebrate the very shit
That slow us down and probably kill
Song ain’t even jamming though
Number one in every ville
Got that on repeat
Right before you wake
On your way to work
On your way to church
Stuck in traffic
Right before you go to sleep
I know you tired
Of that overdrive
That commercialized sing along
Wonder why they play this song all the time

It’s better this way

On the radio every single day

Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way
If you looking for some original soul
I know where you should go
It’s better this way

I didn’t know about you till you recognized
It wasn’t paid for or televised by the label
You couldn’t see it all on cable or
Advertised at award shows
I didn't beef with none your favorite rappers
Or drop a sex tape after
Claiming it leaked off of my cellphone
When really I’m tryin' to sell more
And I wouldn’t just say anything
On the radio just to get fame
Or trap it out, gangster rap it out
Knowin' I ain’t never sold a thang
Bust a dime on the coffee table
Really shorty I went to school
I wasn’t friends with the son
Of the executive that ran the label
I had to pay dues
Wasn’t no blueprint where I come from
I couldn’t blow up in the backyard
Couldn’t walk the streets with my Cd
Give it to a DJ, like that's hard
And he play it everyday 'till I got a deal
Album date and advanced tour
My takeover wasn’t overnight
To be honest with you, it was a gift from god

It’s better this way
You don’t really like what they play
On the radio every single day
It’s better this way
Ain’t no telling when it’s gon change
Cause they all really say the same things
It’s better this way

Vanilla Sky,It’s Better This Way,2015,"Leave the town, smoke some herb
Speak the word, drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through

We can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

Is it sad that I'd rather hustle
Get this money on the double
You don't get it
It's cryptic for the simple minded
The type don't see the future even if they right behind it
So I'm chilly willy when talking bout dreams to most folk
Cause to me it seems like a billion when you came up dirt poor
And that's like talking about the summer to someone that only seen snow
It ain't rocket science, either it's a dud or it blow
Damn, I wanna make some hard decisions
Like should I really get a driver when I cop a Bentley?
Is that thousand dollar suit worth it cause it's vintage?
If I bring two woman with me, does that mean I'm pimping? Maybe
Did the cuff links give it away
Or the mink on display, no hesitation to pay
Make reservations to play while most work
I'm in pursuit of happiness, I'm tired of hurt

So we can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

I just wanna go to Africa
Find the meaning of life and try to master the art of meditation
The purest concentration
Cause all this weed and drank I pour might cause me complication
But for now we spilling drops all on the kitchen counter
Breaking down God green earth, fight for what we had first
They knocked the nose off the sphinx so we can't tell
Coulda' been kings and queens, but now we pumping cells
So, fuck outta' here with your undercover ways
Snaking in the grass, looking to get paid
Fade to black
When I'm tryna' get my piece of mind
Let my girl massage my temple to unlock my shine
Just a matter of time, she say that I will become the man that I'm supposed to be
I put my faith in the hands of God even though times is hard
I'm happy just to be

So we can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

Ain't gotta twist it like a 
All we need to know is where the bread at
Thinking bout some moves to make
Right some wrongs, bills to pay
Flashing lights, pass the dice
Let me roll Reverend, hope I hit seven
Baby need a new pair of shoes
If I don't give it, tell me what we gon do?

We can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

Kill 'em

They're like
There he go again talking 'bout that candy paint
Slabbin' out, working wheel in the daytime
Don't settle for the trap, hi-hats and the clap
Bih', what you know about that bassline
Big booming, slip the lever
Haters grip for the backseat of the car like a fallen star
All these screens of light, I can charge at night
Ladies drink for free when they' at the bar
Pull up, barely stood up
High fiving every old school player tippin' in the lot
With a couple pretty things on they' shoulders
Then they told her ""Krizzle gotta give 'em what you got""
So I kill 'em with the low
Joe Lewis knocking down doors
Grippin that wheel
They like ""What happened to the lac?""
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues
But today it's all about Monte Carlo, propped up on lows
I set it out, I set it out, I set it out for sure
I keep it cooler than a polar bear's toes
You better hop in before I close that door

Dynamic, panoramic
I ain't seen the roof since you seen mine
Forgiato, paint melado
When you seen me, shawty you seen shine
Glass house, I put the ass out
When I roll supreme, I call it creepin' clean
I hit the gas on the low when I'm on the scene
Ya I be waking up them neighbors with the 15's when I vroom
Candy paint on the fleet
6 deep with the slab, ballin' in these street
Pull up on the curb - what the fuck, what you heard?
I swang and I swerve, I'm swangin' for keeps
That's that old school flow
Sugar Ray knocking down doors
Grippin' that wheel
They like ""What happened to the lac?""
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues
But today it's all about Monte Carlo, propped up on lows
I set it out, I set it out, I set it out for sure

Got Me Thru,It’s Better This Way,2015,"Ain't every flower in the concrete bloomin'
Never walked through Bloomin's, it was gloomin'
Droppin' numbers for a feature
Western Union was my partner
I was tryna' get them bourbons on some choppers
Ridin' dirty through the city like I got you
Everything I had about ya blazing fire
I'mma quit when I cop me a couple prizes
It got hot up in that drive
I got tired of sweating bullets, like one day I gotta pull it
Yea - back against the wall, my ego turned into bully
I ain't moving, I ain't budging - I got buzzin' with no budget
Bloggers said I had it next, 
I was standing next to nothing
Conversations getting deeper, growing further from my people
Lost my love of life in high school I always knew she was a keeper
I was lost since, double crossed, bitch,  now I'm cross fit
Had to work a jelly for a outfit
Outskirts know me by my middle name, ain't no one to blame
Twenty thou', bust it down with the game, everything, mane

Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through bitch, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves,  that's what got me through

Pushing that Maxima with no cash in her
Fresh T so I ain't fastenin' up my belt
Back then I was jamming myself
Like who the fuck gon' tell me
I ain't gonna be the best that they ever heard?
Sipping 211's on the curb
Rollin' dime sacks for that herb and blow it down
What you know about that Greyhound on I-20, off the porch
Out the pen selling CD's outside of Magic City
That's dedication, preparation
My presentation too player made
Clockin' in like Flavor Flav
I'm selling lemon stand lemonade
My Forces bubble toed
Boosie fade turn 'em all even
Grandma think I'm smoking with the junkies cause I'm 160 somethin'
Barely eatin', but that prime time flow
When you been up like two days
Trap house, making beats for the low
50 dollars here, 100 dollars there
But when you're dead broke, everything gone
Thanking God for that place to stay in them showers
Even if they're cold
Them nice young wome
n would cook me a plate for free, even if they hoes
So I don't take for granted steak and shrimp
Leave a healthy tip on the side
For all the times God showed me love
Even if I couldn't pay my tithes

Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, bitch that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves, that's what got me through

Late night talking like early night
More like, everyday we was on a mission
To get off in a mansion, not off in a prison
Everywhere representing that 'sippi like we 'posed to, pimp
Take everything I love, put it on my shoulders, pimp throwed it
Everything stood in our way while we tryna build
Got crushed and folded
Now suddenly all the opponents writing rhymes and bending corners
Gimme 50 feet, you all up on me
Cause I don't believe you when you say you want it
And it's bigger than just tryin' to get it when you want to get it right
Went platinum, how to feed your kids like fighting for your life
When the choices wasn't even spoke, the rent or the lights
We all in the dark beggin' for sparks
And can't see the way whether day or the night
And some of them troubles just ain't worth the fight
But this is for pride, this is for niches
I need a witness we havin' church in the night
I guess that I'm doing alright
And thank God for good friends and cousins
Cause I could've been out here struggling
Talkin' about my should've, would've, could've havin' nothin'
When my nothing turns to something
Best believe you've gone to see
No matter how good I make it look, it ain't easy being me, OG

That's what got me through (got me through)
That's what got me through (Better believe it y'all)",https://genius.com/Big-krit-got-me-thru-lyrics
No Static,It’s Better This Way,2015,"No static when it's cool
No static when you got a lotta crew
And you're always on the go
Gettin' to it like you're supposed
No static when it's chill
No static when you kinda got a feel
For somethin' on the real
Livin' life for what it is

Today might be a good day, feel it in my bones
The sun shine, she make the flicker from off the chrome
 of the wheel
What good is the bass if you don't hear
Them tweets got to be clear as glass
Brush my teeth and wash my ass
Prep my beard, press my clothes, soap, water, rags
Can't be busted with these Jordans
Krit spend a lot you can't afford
So I'm Moonwalkin' out the crib, flex
Lint rollin perpetrators and boppers off my fad
Crank the whip once, pressed, gas slammed
I got an automatic

No static when it's cool
No static when you got a lotta crew
And you're always on the go
Gettin' to it like you're supposed
No static when it's chill
No static when you kinda got a feel
For somethin' on the real
Livin' life for what it is

Now propose I break 'em off somethin' proper
I got more colors in my paint than Cyndi Lauper
Radio take check, I get my partner on the phone
Like 'what's on deck?', shawty bet that up, set that up
Cool, just hit me when the drink fall through
I got a couple darlin' nicki's just for the crew
Talkin' 'bout, there's some single chicks to mingle wit' and smash
They ain't the clingy type, they only here for fashion
The camera flashin', they smokin', drinkin', put some cash in
One of them classy, I peeped her ass through her khakis
I told her that my mouth piece everlasting
Then I got her automatic

No static when it's cool
No static when you got a lotta crew
And you're always on the go
Gettin' to it like you're supposed
No static when it's chill
No static when you kinda got a feel
For somethin' on the real
Livin' life for what it is

Domino's slammin', five deuce four tray
And sticky icky, rollin' liquor, flowin' niggas ain't playin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static mothafucka
Slip and slide up and down the boulevard
Creepin' when you do it like I does it when we buzzin', no sleepin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, no static mothafucka
Got the radar on checking for the laws, we ain't trippin
If the neighbors call, tell us keep it down we ain't listenin'
No static, no static mothafucka
No static, 
no static, got an automatic

No static when it's cool

Can’t Be Still,It’s Better This Way,2015,"Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

Mic check, one check, one two, anybody out there listenin'
To my pains and my disposition, I'm on that impossible mission
Tryna make somethin' out of nothin'
Before the government come and crush it
Ain't enough weed and Codeine you can pour me
To keep me buzzin'
Shawty burnin' palo santo to clear the air
Lay some Krizzle out even if my energy ain't really there
I'm thankful that you shared
I'm more concerned with a big house and a nice car
But she don't care
But I'm an alpha male so I grind
The 40 acres and mule, I want mine
Ain't nothin' free in life they woulda told me
As a new born I could barely walk
Tryna chase a dollar on Easter Sunday
Then they popped my collar like be a player
Don't fall victim to bein' broke
Them white folk want you down and poor
So get money, that's all I know

Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

Nowadays bottles get popped
Ain't been to the doctor for a physical in a minute
I'm sure my liver probably shot
Ain't no sleepin' if you on
Tryna keep up with the Joneses
Yeah, it's lonely at the top but the view is beautiful
In the morning to tell the truth I miss my family
Ain't spoke to my mom in weeks
I promised her I buy her a new house
The next time that we speak
So I'ma hit the road like a flat tire
Run these brakes 'till they squeak
And I'ma pimp what I can from Def Jam
Cause I know my worth ain't cheap
Ya'll can't sell me no dream
I done been down and out, growing
If happiness is the tour bus that's a far aways from homeless
That's a far away from where they want me
Shuckin', jivin', for a piece of change
These niggas do whatever for the shine
But I can't be the same

Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here
Lord, Lord, Lord
I've been down for so long I can't be still
Calling out for your name, heaven it can't be here

Keep It Boomin,It’s Better This Way,2015,"Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted,
 
let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

Woke up out my dream, me and my life's supreme
Fuck you mean?
Went from rags to riches on the scene, now they call me king
Father saw my crib like, this the wildest shit he'd seen
Living proof that God got a plan if I don't intervene
Old school cleaner than a bitch put it on some heels
Round table eating with my team, let me catch the bill
Touching down
Fuck you niggas out here always hating
If I listen to your barking, I might never get this paper
Kept it playa from the rooter to the tooter to the tomb
I been on it since Ms. Rhonda went and pushed me out the womb
Hallelujah! Ain't no losing when your winning on the court
I supplied my own demand, ain't no way I come up short

Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted,
 let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

Hoped up out my whip with the candy drip
April showers when they lay me down
Underground, I won't smell the flowers
So I'm only up early morning putting plans in motion
I can't let this go to waste, nigga out here been losing focus
Chasing after hoes and acceptance from the non-believers
How the fuck you judge the South if you never ever seen it?
That's just on the real, fuck you if you think its cotton fields
Nigga we out here buyin cribs bigger than the buildings that you in
Put that on my grill, that's just how I feel
Blow a check, 
looking like I'm King Tut
All this gold around my neck
Lord, Hallelujah! For the shine I was given
All the hate I don't mind
I'll recline cause I'm winning

Ain't no way I could be losing when I'm winning
Losing when I'm winning
Glass house, never ever tinted,
 let them see me in it
Celebrate the grind and the vision, Lord we independent
Country nigga made them pay attention, we ain't even finished
Gotta keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin'
Lord  keep it boomin'
Gotta keep it boomin' for you one time, multi 'till the sun die

Yeah, yeah
I'm talking, like, sonic booming, like Jackson State.
 You know what I'm saying, like, a trunk of the old school whip. Driving by your grandmomma house trying not to wake her up, but you keep hitting donuts cause you ain't got nowhere to go kind of 808 sub booming system. The interior fucked up, but you really don't care at all. Nah, your playa-potnas wanna ride with you, but they don't give you no gas money kind of booming. I'm talking about '99. SLAB vogues, get you an adapter. You don't really want your rims to scrub and all, but that just how it be. Sub on. (echoes)",https://genius.com/Big-krit-keep-it-boomin-lyrics

 “If you could sleep with an angel between the sheets
Would you give up your beliefs as I proceed to spread my wings?""
I’m like, If it’s good enough, maybe, I guess
I’m no saint I admit, sometimes I fall victim to flesh
I think you worth the regrets
Ifs and the maybes, I'll be down for pleasure
I think you should save it, let me rephrase it
Magic woman, palm reader, to say that you bomb
My records turn, 
I know your chakras 
aligned
The world can't define our spiritual bond
You more than sunshine in the dark

Let it shine like gold 
Put a Spell on you

you wanna say something
She let it shine like gold

Piece On Chain,It’s Better This Way,2015,"I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain

The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around

I put that piece on chain, it cost me a grip
If rapping is acrobatics, I'm making it flip
Fuck what you heard, fuck on the curb
It shine like a light
If hoes don't start emerging you ain't doing it right
You just new to the game, you ain't been in the field
I was sharpening mine, tryna' go for the kill
Tryna' get me a mill, fly a private Alliance
Tell 'em 'probably never land, keep it going 'round and around
Highly anticipated, I'm on it and motivated
Told 'em it ain't nothing to claim and it's complicated
Sitting on Mount Olympus, sending out smoke signals
Word to my unborn, niggas ain't fucking with us
Since I was in Granny's kitchen I knew I'd get greater later
Fast-forward ten years, my crib need an elevator
Krizzle, back in time, swangin' and coming down
Motherfuck stand still

I put the piece on chain, the whip on swang
I'm fuck all them busty bitches that fuck with a king
I saw it all from the rooftop, condo clockin' figures
Fingers is swollen, my wrist has been fucking with me
I whip-whip on it, muddy water - sip on it
She gon' suck the soul out me if I put the tip on it
I throw on a rubber, dive under covers and go to town
Can't fuck it raw, that pussy going round and a round
Stay off and play em all, my flexes been activated
Moving at top speed, haters is hesitating
All about power plays, scoring to make a move
Call up an audible, we lift them laws and come through
Gotta be realistic, I stack it and make it work
It ain't worth getting if you don't get it right out the dirt
They heard that I'm back in time, trunk knocking underground
Rotating deuce twice
Going round and around

I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing

K.R.I.T. 4eva (Chapter One),UnKnown,2015,"Let me die just to see my name on the wall
Never fall, gotta make due
Yea I signed my first deal, wasn't no mill
Barely had a dollar to my name and I was broke by day two
Doing all types of songs, they were jammin, don't get me wrong
But my pops was like ""J this ain't you""
Now I'm in the 'sip takin trips to B-ham
Cause eating off the food in my grandma's kitchen wouldn't do
I'm talking in the studio
All night mixing from scratch
Making beats, at the best getting less than the crack my nigga servin'
Thinking ""Where did I go wrong?""
Never should have quit school
I'd probably make more money flipping burgers
Than kicking verses for niggas serving chicken for skrilla
To buy some bottles for change
But all the while I’m hurting inside, tuck in my pride
Knowing I'm ahead of the game, shit
I wrote my best songs on the grey hound of the A
Bitch I swear I ate a sandwich a day
I'm talking shit with the junkies at the race track
Peddling CD's that most niggas ain't played
Gave it for free, cause most niggas ain't paid
I gotta get heard, take a hit of that herb
I'm high as fuck, asking myself
What good is a win if I take a loss?
There's no answer
Blow the re-up on a dancer
Down to fuck with money but I'm to scared to chance her
Hit the DJ booth to get my songs spent
Talking ""Just Touched Down"" but my flight got cancelled
With a bottle in my hand, it's pretty much gone
Take a slow sip, tryna pretend that I'm on
With these 'sace shades, buck 50 soakin wet, with the heart of a lion but my pockets of a wretch
And that's before your favorite rapper said he was a vet
I didn't have muscle to pull
I couldn't stretch to the finish line
While you was eating breakfast it was dinner time
For a pro nigga go getter
Young nigga face but the soul of a old nigga
Grew up to be just like my pops and it shows, nigga
Rap name fixed
But then there was a whole lot of ""Who the fuck is this?""
A whole lot of ""KIRT's"" and ""Who the fuck is KRIS?""
Another acronym that don't stand for shit
And when it comes to names that's as bad as it gets
Fast forward ten years, now who don't know KRIT?
Two albums on the shelf, I beat the sophomore jinx
I lost a few friends over ends, we don't speak
I'm thinking this must be what God really want for me
Top floor reminiscing, lord I can't sleep
Like, what happens if I close my eyes and it's all a dream
And I'm backin that telly on Martin Luther King
Tryna make a difference
Caught up in my feelings, lord why they won't listen?
Riding with my partner and he riding dirty
I'm kinda scared, cause I know he ain't gonna take his charge
He ain't prepared, and he'll have to face that
And I just needed another ride to the race track
I'm so thankful that them laws never pulled us over
God took the wheel, cause neither one of us was sober
Downing bottle after bottle just to make it better
I survived the worst of it, now it's KRIT 4eva

Guillotine Flow,UnKnown,2015,"You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
Eh nigga this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down, shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get

5 star flow, been a while since I done bossed up
Round table talkin’ I’m seasoned so put the salt up
Get crossed up, I’m Crawford, you awful, give the ball up
We all in, no fallen’, from that platform, got tossed up
Like  don’t worry about these others
If I let you push that foreign with fins that mean I love you
Put that shit to heart, played my part, 'til my closet's Noah’s ark
Gator toes, fox and furs, matching belt, life is hard
So I hit the strip money making KRIT
Used to bang for a block, now I’m on my acre shit
40 and a mule, anything else minuscule
I ain’t asking for your plate, I just wanna be full

Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? Yea you geekin’ huh?

Serve it like some hubbers on the corners
To them geekers and them freakers and them stoners
That fiend for that very moment
Brakes were screeching like sneakers but the speakers
Was beating so loud nobody could peep it
They double back like “what you sold me?”
This shit here OG for the low-low, I can’t go forth without
Paying you more though cause I’m oh-oh-oh-oh-oh so high
That’s what I hear a lot but my product is real rock
Nirvana with the ear throb, if you need more you should try
Never stepped on upper echelon with the fire
Now run along, keep the line moving
Cause there’s more folks that wanna buy
And we got that, never sold out, can’t hold back supply
Unless you searching for that wack shit, I ain’t that type of guy

Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Now I’m on my king shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit
Give ‘em that dope that fiends get
You geekin’ huh? You geekin’ huh?
You geekin’ huh? Yea you geekin’ huh?

Rapsody, show me off like a trophy
Five finger rap a nigga but now I’m Kobe
I been lying low key but niggas been in the media
I know your life story without looking up Wikipedia
It costs a lot to be famous
Words don’t break bones but that don’t mean they ain’t painless
Steel sharpen steel but I don’t know if it’s stainless
Conversations with the older guys laying the game thick
Came in the game like Jameis on some fucker shit
Niggas ain't immortal, but living like fuck a bucket list
Became famous, get money, spend it on rubber tits
The real niggas I know all respectin’ the real shit
That’s the media, mama ain’t raise an idiot
Hollered at the Doc and my niggas is like “is you kidding me?”
Yea, game respect game, just promise when the fame come nigga, you won’t ever change
I’m in this Cam’ron pink, I look good in these streets don’t I?
Niggas talk shit like a nigga won’t pull up on ‘em
You know where I be, talkin’ Common rappin’ bout corners
I’m the black storm trooper all the whites folks mad at
Don’t like female rappers? You only mad you can’t bag that
Fuck you and your homeboy, security got ‘em
You want a rebound you better holler at Rodman
Need a dentist for that bullshit you talkin’ homie
You know I keep a new flow if you feelin’ tender on it
Hotline bling and ain’t nobody answering your calls
How meek of you niggas not to answer me at all, I feel a way
But the album comin’ so I’ll save it for another day
Calling me Rapsody, ain’t no Tigger though
Shouts to my left coast niggas out on Figueroa
To make it spark I ain’t need a trigger or a milli yo
All I ever needed was a trill guillotine flow

Shorty cause this that guillotine flow
I’mma cut them niggas down shorty, anything goes
Wasn't none of them niggas around, shorty
Shorty now I’m on my queen shit, C.R.E.A.M. shit
Eagle wing shit, bubble a high beam shit

We took 2014 off but we back, mayne
B4SXSW...

Still waiting on my just due
Candy paint, got it oak blue
On the outside looking inside...
At these non-believers hollering, ""fuck you!""
Cause they ain't playa, barely paid
Working 9-5 just to scrape some change
While I was flexin' chrome, with a yellow bone
With a fat ass,  face
Slid in the pussy like a cross fader
And jigged in it like all day
No love lost, my team floss
We gon' break 'em off, 'til we all paid
And that's word to Steve-O, 
Big Sant and Smoke DZA
Multi til' the sun die
Fuck if you don really fuck with it
That fake love don't mean shit
Talking about we been partners
Matter of fact you ain't got to spin my records
I sell out shows and make 
And it make sense, fuck what you heard
I kill songs 'til the beats gone
And hold a memorial service like right after
Another chapter, another topic
Your personality is so out of pocket
My bank account like, ""I'm too full.""
Your bank account like, ""You need to stop it.""
It's just a hobby, you ain't getting bread
Just a dream if there's no cream
You wake up starving
I wake up calling
For a bitch to feed me like Akeem
Watching Pain in Full on 5 screens
Franchise with like 5 rings
Dope enough to kill 5 fiends
And you done played along for 5 teens
And that’s on the real
Show my grill
Pop my trunk and one finger whip
Bangin' Screw like, ""What it do?""
A Mississippi Pimp with some Texas shiiit!
Believe that there
Make it where a bad bitch need that there
Fuck the world and bust a nut in her
And tell that bitch she can see that there
On the front of Forbes, gonna' G' that there
And that broke shit I had to leave that there
Hit the lot with my old school
But that funk, I need that there
That's no lie, I got to feed the fam'
I do it for the south
You do it for the gram
We ain't the same so I understand
If you fall off
And are never seen again
And that's tough luck but thats how it be
My trunk banging at ‘em with Sicily
I swear if aliens came down with fleets
It’s cause my subwoofer phoned E.T
The boy sounding like a space modulator
Innovator so they had to see
I'm knocking pictures off the wall at the white house
My neon shining with the lights out
We got to fuck, get my dick sucked
Tell her suck slow and don’t bite down
Too exclusive, too vicious
I bought a three story like this ain't expensive
 doing hella shows
I couldn’t hit the gym, I was on the road
Didn’t lift weights
Eatin' made steak
But impressive bands kept my pockets swoll'
Tell her bust it open like the optimo
Watching out for these jealous snakes
Cause niggas slither
When you’re clocking figures
Like a two year old
When I’m throwing cake
Grab a hand full
And mush it in your face, bitch
I'm still clocking figures
Working wheels like 9 to 5
Chopping these blades everyday...

Word to Slim Thug on four Swangas and adapters
Shine on my vessel got my statue in the rafters
Balling in the mix from here and thereafter

Wrote another chapter bout climbing up the ladder
Got glass on the dash I just hope it don’t shatter
Into pieces, diamond in the gold in the teefis
Accent the features, pants with the creases, prestigious
With that player shit when I play
The bass might knock the bumper off any day
Keep the drank in tray, put the Big by the K
Don’t be fronting on my name, you can’t live where I stay
You don’t pay what I pay to get the Kobe filet
You prolly thinking Lakers I was talking bout steak
It’s marble on the plate,
 crustaceans on the way
Got tired of catching shrimp, so I mixed up the bait
I mixed up the batter, then I baked up the cake
I chopped up the slices and scraped off the flake
I'm sorry for the mix-up, man, scraped off the fake
It ain't enough salt to get tossed to kill my chase
Creeping like a slug in a slab on a slope
But if I do the dash I can keep up with the bose
The Wraiths, the Rarries, the Lex and the Ghost
If you ain't riding foreign this some shit you can’t decode
I hate to be high sadity, but I gotta be it
Getting green, best show on earth, I gotta see it
That shit was super drastic, we reachin' in the dashes
Throw away the throwaway we recycling the plastic
Pay my own way, buy whatever I imagine
The only time a nigga carry me is in a casket
Straight off the porch, poke my chest our for real
Fell out the womb prolly showing my grill
Sipped on the syrup before I started coughin'
Prolly hit the southside before I started walking
Knew about eat eat before I started talking
Balling up my fist trying to keep these haters off me
Crucifix charm the only thing that could cross me
Lauryn Hill flow had to kill these track softly
Acrobatic trunk, let it flip and let it thump
From the bass out the jump that's that Dominique Dawes
Run away with it Usain with the dash
Olympic gold medal standing up for the cash
I'm itching for the scratch you would think I had a rash
Barre Baby in the deck had a nigga acting bad
In my crooked plates all the way to Beltway
The way I do it H-Town you would think a nigga stayed
All the way to Dallas the 15s you feel it
Jamming Big Chuck talking Southside the realest
I was born with the gumpshun, you wouldn’t know where to get it
Turn anger into green you can call me Bill Bixby
Hulk with the grind and the hustle’s incredible
Order the expensive bottle even if it’s terrible
Deadstock J’s I'm wearin', they ain't even wearable
The rhyme show the time and the chime like a parable
Practice what I preach grab the bib for a freak
Let her gobble on my meat till I bust in her cheek
Then it’s back on the creep for the fetty and the gwalla
Groundhog Day do it all over tomorrow
Might catch a plane and get fly for no reason
Cuz some shit you just can’t sprinkle for the season
Some shit you just can’t, you just can’t
Like dethrone a king and follow me off in the bank
Tae bo flow kick that shit like Billy Blanks
Just have the lint brush if I ever wear the mink

[VII/XII] Flying Lotus (Freestyle),#12FOR12,2016,"Yeah
Reminisce, reminisce
Uh huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm praying for you even if you don't ask
Just in case the drank and the dank might be our last
And those times we laugh and smile become a thing of the past
I'd rather smell the flowers now before I'm under the grass
I know, We got a habit of holding onto those grudges
Emergency brake loving, some folks just ain't budging
For they kinfolk, Until they ride in that limo
Kind of parade that you don't wave out the window
That's a sad story, we never dreamed we make it past 40
Now that we pushing 30 living fast just ain't worth it
I'm trying to plant a seed and grow it on the richest surface
Have a child with my queen the closest thing to being perfect
Perhaps this verse is better suited for a song
But sometimes a hook can water down what's going on
And a freestyle will get the point across before too long
I pray my words chime like church bells when I'm gone
The lifestyle of rippin' and runnin' is cool for starters
I'm trying to live for now and still focus on tomorrow
Uplifting times of sorrow even if the time is borrowed
And be the kind of king like my father
All I ever wanted was to make my parents proud
Ever since I left the 'Sip and got my ass up off the couch
The road less traveled, but I wouldn't change the route
I put up with the bullshit to put on for the Sou'
A lesson learned, Cause shit get crazy when you're finally grown
Despite the silent nights, God never left me on my own, made me strong
Now I gotta big up my family big up my friends
So if these bigots belittle, we'll be bigger than them
I seen it though, clear as day
I get tired of leaving home, sometimes I'd rather stay
And kick it to my pops about the biz, parlay with my brothers and hang out with they kids
I hope they still remember who their uncle really is
I heard they're walking now, no more crawling in the crib
No more drinkin' bottles cause they askin' for a sip, I can't let ya
Thinkin' back when grandma used to give me all those lectures
Now that I'm older I can see from her perspective
That money don't buy love, happiness, or Heaven, blessings
I hope my tone convey that I'm serious and that you feel it
If these my last words, let them be more than lyrics, Krizzle

This is for if you reminisce over me, my God
This is for if you reminisce over me, my God

Ill blow all that shit before they tax me

I make a beat and rap on it that’s like fire to fire

We set the standard higher than a giant standing on two mountains
I built my ship to ride the wave im like who drowning?
Now days the bag of hot potatoes my nigga like you counting
Too much, wrist hurtin, how much? ain't certain?

Your friends was easy targets and you easy with the scratch
Them hoes was easier to fuck, so you easily attached
You was easy with the car keys, and easily was jacked
When the pussy way too easy, its so easy to get laxed
Everybody eavesdropping, so you easily get taxed
'cus they know you got it
When you easy-going everything comes out of pocket
Once you start easing up, it ain't easy to stop it
Talking anything but favors make easier topics
When you was ballin' for yourself it was easier shopping
Now everybody want something, and ain't easily coppin'
It ain't easy being a plane in a world full of rockets
Even when you off the radar its easy to spot you
Its easy to drop you
Its easy to bake bread when you savin' the ends
But it ain't easy when that bag go empty again
Easy does it
Yeah you hustling for the easy route
Yeah you would go back to the base but that's the easy out
Nowadays the easy play means you out of bounds
It ain't easy being a peasant when you've held the crown
Watch enemies over you like you never had
Its easy to be forgotten if you never mattered

No debating they’ll pass the crown to ya
At the feet of a king that was chained to defeat till he rose out the creek of the sip with a chip on his shoulders
Last of a dying breed who gonna lead it

Matta fact there is no subject matter or exposure
I can feel the end getting closer
Maybe I ain't sober the drank got me dranked out
The gas mixed with hash and oil got ya tanked out
Spent so much time in the vault I was banked out
Don’t talk to me about hit song with yo stank mouth
Im being serious
Dark as night still see the vision
Country boy break the block with no collision
Old school MC with no suspension
Sometimes it was me and God and my religion
Itchin to make some scratch
And jump in the 'Lac with the twanks and the flat
The diamond in the back
Bumping UGK, my rims don’t scrape, my trunk on quake
I can't hear hate like ""What you say?""

And still moving
I never seen so many with rings thats still losing
Never seen so many faces

Yeah, yeah
Tell her she just need to gone slow it a lil bit uh, one time

I'm just, trynna' turn her out for the weekend
I got an old school whip we can creep in
We could kick it till the sun come up
If she really trynna' fuck I got a room she can sleep in
This ain't nuthin' that she used to
I'm trynna' connect just like a Bluetooth
And get off on her spine and break it down
Flip it over, beat it up from behind up above the ground
H-Town knocking these boots
Got it so wet I think I need a Sea-doo
Swimming, swimming, swimming in the pussy
If her body was a show I'd have to book it
Four legs and cornbread sweeter than a sundae on Sunday with chocolate chip cookies
After I give ya' what ya' need from your head to your feet please tell me you're cooking
Yeah yeah, fix a nigga a plate, yeah yeah, fix a nigga a plate
I got the kinda appetite to eat you out of house and home
The hunger still strong even if I done ate
Yeah yeah, fix a nigga a drink, yeah yeah, fix a nigga a drink
The liquor got it going, professional with the stroking
If she keep her mouth open she gon' tell me how I taste
Like woo, I'm good with the aim on the low
I came with a chain and the grill let it show
Shining the diamonds, her beauty is blinding
I hit her with the wood I have her body on glow
I know your man don't do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it right
Don't let this be the last time you're reaching orgasm
I'm not that far away you can call me anytime
I got another call, hold on
It's the wrong number should I go on
Give you the kind of memory that you can roll on
Do it yourself whenever you miss me like so long
Figure a hot bath, a better day than them lame niggas
Watching porn wishing you could change with them
You ain't getting freaky for no reason
And all you wanna' do is come and shake 'till you sleeping
I know, I know, I know, I know what you need (Yeah)

I was grindin' from the sun up to sun down for Mississippi
On the late night, ain't much more that you could tell me
Ain't much that I ain't sold that you could sell me
Out of the kitchen I'm whippin' something to change up
Callin' up the radio only for them to hang up
Frustration boilin', I harbor and let it linger
Hit the booth and burn it, all of the fuel from all the anger
Goddamn, when I'm on, they gotta pay up
Every motherfuckin' pawn that I weigh up
Roaches in our hotel, I gotta stay up
One day, God gon' answer my prayers
Angels watch over me in my city
In case a hater want my place, come get it
I never wanted more than I needed, just try to maintain
Make a couple plays and show my brothers the same thing
Ride clean even if it was a plain Jane
I used to be on foot trynna chase change
A meal a day will get me through the trenches
A pack of ramen noodles, Faygo drank ain't fulfillin'
But fuck it, if the next step is beggin' for a biscuit
In the soup line of the church house kitchen
I put the pieces together, lo and behold
I know the game's a rabbit hole but how far does it go?
To the money, perhaps
Financial freedom is far from the trap
Far from the “fuck you's” and fraudulent daps
Far from the city, you might need a map, to get where I'm at
The only time you ever see me drop a pen
Long as there's breath in my lungs, I keep goin' in
Long as 11 ain't the mark, I'll be at a 10
Forever multi to the very end

I'm a paper chaser, I got my stock up high, remainin' a G

Now I’m on the dough
On the grind

Break it down
Mirror mirror mirror on the wall
Who the coldest MC around?
Creeping crawling bumping sounds
Got more TV than a lounge
Bottle service white and brown
So much drank that I can drown
Stand on the back of these couches
Shout out to DJ they shout us
The love us with more than them vouchers
Its crazy the industry doubt us
So I’m picking up the pieces
President starch and the creases
Make it where they gotta see me
Pay me just to come to meetings

I built it from the ground up
Act like they found us
From the sign of the label, tried to drown us
I built a boat in a moat for my castle
I graduated to a businessman, I got tassels
Another chapter, another story, another plot
Mother fuck the ball in their court, I took a shot
Three presidents in 5 years, I never stopped
While they worried about the single sales--
The albums flopped
Oh Lord, Lord, Lord there they go
Trying to fuck me out another but I ain't a ho
I produce and write my own shit, I know the score
I'ma drop another mixtape, and go on tour
We ain't playing games man, I'm too grown
For you to try to take me out my motherfucking zone
For you to try and tell me I ain't motherfucking known
I guess I gotta do it how I done it on my own, UH

I been a free agent nigga
I been a free agent nigga
Even when I was signed
It was multi til I die
I've proven motherfuckers wrong
Every got damn time
I been a free agent nigga
I been a free agent nigga
Naw they can't hold us
Put the whole team on my shoulders
Now there's money on the way
Because the contract's over

What good is a team if they don't ball out with you?
Domino niggas they'll fall out with you
At the table with the majors they go all out with you
Til you're underground with it, they won't crawl out with you
So they serve, serve you a plate
Full of scraps and the bait
You ain't eating so you ate
You ain't moving so you shake
What you can
'cuz you gotta drop another album
But ain't make a mother fucking dollar, OH!
Mane it's hard to understand
How they rob a nigga then shake his other hand?
How I hit the road when I ain't never have a chance?
How I sell out shows and I ain't even make 'em dance?
How I ain't a gimmick but I got all these fans?
How I made in merch what you got in your advance?
How I work the tape like I was bagging up the grams?
How a country boy took that country shit and ran?
UH

I been a free agent nigga
I been a free agent nigga
Even when I was signed
It was multi til I die
I've proven motherfuckers wrong

$30,UnKnown,2016,"So it don't really matter how much money I do gain over life
It just if I owe my homies and my partners back in the day
I gotta give back man, believe that though
Yeah, believe that there

I bought a bag of hot fries, hotdog and a drink
I put the rest off in the tank
I owe you 30 dollars
I had to pay you that
What kind of friend would I be?
If I ain't pay you back
I bought a 40 and a magazine
Of all the cars,hoes, clothes
That i never seen
I owe you 30 dollars
I had to pay you that
What kind of friend would I be?
If I ain't pay you back

Multi sweats with the multi tee
Before I had the multi clothes you could multi me
Multi million dolllar dreams rolled in dirt
Colt 45 still reserved, irk and jerk
Cop a fifth for the 599
Little caesers hot and ready
That's gon' hold us down
I had a scheme to get rich
And Imma show you how
I can't pay no bills
I know shit is real
But thank you for the couch
And that chick that came through
I thought I loved her
I'm glad you saw my checks
And shot a young player rubbers
Winter time cold bought a young player covers
Eviction notice on the door
I'm sorry for  the trouble
I ain't have no job
But the beats was a thing to our soul
And that bass filled the space
When the heater was broke
And all those hamburger helper meals
That sat on the stove
Almost made a nigga sick cause the mixture was old
Its funny how that funny style shit never changes
Humbling, niggas ain't come up how we came up
So now the steak medium plus
Medium well, way too tough
Worst cut, it ain't medium much
Plate 4 hundred degrees, hot boy to the touch
Sweet potato casserole, nigga, fuck with the crust
Imma shoot the shot if need be, I live for the clutch
Stopped sipping drank, it had us on lean like a crutch
Nowadays it's a stand up game
No sitting room in my vault, I got stand up change
Wine tasting and a billion talk
And stocks in the villa route
The only time I tell a chick to taste it and spit it out
Long way from the boxes of wine
Roasting Louis 13 under candle for shine
Copping shit they'll never stock
Shoes they'll never drop
My music got way too much bounce
It'll never flop
They some lames in a bubble
They'll never pop
Puppets on a string
Shuck and jive call them fraggle rocks
But we cut from a different cloth
Safari, my nigga that's a different cost
See the smoke, garlic, aeoli, that's a different sauce
Invisible set with the grill, that's a different floss
Making toast for the blessings, I'm a different boss
Losing friends over bread, that's a different loss
So just in case I never told you before
Let me pay back what I owe
So just in case I never told you before
Let me pay back what I owe",https://genius.com/Big-krit-30-lyrics

Propaganda news channels, that shit is all for show
Camera phone videos is like all we know
Diluting what an eye witness might really say
Because the whole world saw a murder yesterday
Now your account ain't what it used to be
According to them your eyes can't adjust to the violence you ain't used to see
Police brutality is all in your mind
And the tactics that they use only look worse in rewind
And people die everyday, you should get used to it
Hands behind yo' back, face down, and still say you shootin'
Can't breathe
Knee where your neck be like why you movin'?
Kids in your car, headed home like what you doin'?
Like why you chillin'? Fuck yo' feelin's
Why you smilin' when I'm so serious?
I hate patrolling your space, like why you livin'?
Stop asking questions, why you filmin'?
You look suspicious, I think you dealin'

Kicking with my friends overseas car keys for the freaks
Did enough shows, we'll be back again
Wanna save the world on the go
Grandma in a grave, rest her soul
Wish she lived to be a hundred
So she could see her boy gettin' old
Gettin' grown, takin' care of business
And visions of all the ventures and different riches
Far from penny pinchin' my wishes
And wishing wells
Put my heart and spirit in my lyrics
No regretin', unapologetic even if it don't sell
Tell them motherfuckers I prevail through the struggle

This is what we call Rhythm Roulette

I'm thinking way back when
Tryna to make something outta nothing
Grandma jammin' to music
Well why you doing all that cussing?
I'm like, It's a part of the game
Like when the 808 bang
And knock your pictures of the wall
And you get mad
I'm on some tryna be better than what they expect
A country boy that like rap music but keep Willie Hutch off in the deck
I know that's unorthodox, my flow
But sometimes the poetry much better than a metaphor
And when the groove is right you gotta settle for it
Cause you made this beat thirty minutes ago
And that's just me (that's just me)
I make my own beats, write my own rhymes
That's just me (that's just me)

Big K.R.I.T.,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Yeah, my creator gave me the gift to create
In this mind of mine and plot our escape
In an atmosphere that wouldn't hold our weight
If I leave from here, I'll call when I'm safe
Knocking on the door, hoping someone answers
Yeah, I call that faith
This mouth of mine has turned down water for wine
I still recall that taste of bittersweet
Like when I realize you'll never be as perfect as the one that invented me
And a world full of temptations can make you feel so incomplete
Grew up to better than me, go farther than I can go
See farther than I can see
When my days draw to a close, breathe longer than I can breathe
And I'm fine with that
In the event I decide to move forward what you've done
They can rewind it back
And I'm a proud parent now as I was a proud parent then
I saw you grow up to become the kind of king that I knew you'd always been
Indeed, there's a finish line for me, but for you, there's no end
So, perhaps all that work that has been done was a win
And although my intentions were for good, it still brung us to a sin
But I'll pay for your mistakes as long as this world continues to spin
As this vessel of mine breaks down, I know you have never bend
I'm sure as Multi is your home, hard times will come again
I set aside a book of rhymes that'll pave the way for now and then
I know forever is a mighty long time—so where should we begin?

Dirty Southern mothafucka kicking
Like a red bucket with white top chitlins
Shittin' on niggas, my rhyme flow
Hands-'hind-back, eyes blind fold
Mind, body, and soul connected to the Most High
Even when times got low
Uhh, look how they hate me, but copy me
Possibly I was the one with components and properties
To be the greatest of all time, but you won geography lottery
So I keep kicking, flipping tables, chosen and favored
Fuck being major when giant is greater
Fortune and fame but you fuck for the label
Truth is what made me
Settle down, settle down, I was angry but I'm better now
Niggas talking raising bars, mine amongst the stars
Give it time to level out
If you worried about the flow, I'll make a beat
Write you a hook that you repeat
Even go as far to drop a mixtape that you re-do

We all off in the club like Sincere on Belly
Can't even drink my liquor, money on my celly
Accountant like, ""You got a check, spend it when you ready""
I'm giving niggas hell, pray I go to Heaven
Nailin' in they coffin, the cost of them being off it
Ballin' since Iverson crossed you, winner's circle my office
Fuckin' off with these wins, you fuckin' up with this loss
Waiter forgot my season, I'm glad that they throwin' that salt
Might just throw a toss and holla, ""Fuck it!""
'Cause when your wrist game know the grip changed, niggas' buckets
Chip rain in the strip game, hoes will bust it
Snakes come, chop they heads off
Cobra clutchin' on a meal ticket
Motherfuck you if you feel different
I caught a break, no debate, and you still fishin'
The genie out the bottle and you still wishin' on my downfall 'cause you petty
Confetti ain't even heavy, nigga

Got the win, I want the record, nigga
What's a crown if you don't protect it, nigga?
What's a name if they don't respect it, nigga?
Nah, your confetti ain't even heavy",https://genius.com/Big-krit-confetti-lyrics
1999,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Aww, yeah
Drop it for a nigga
That ass up

Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me one more time (Oh)
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last, yeah (Girl, you know you're bad)
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash (I do love you)

She say I only love the way she drop it, well maybe so
She say I'll probably leave if she don't pop it, we'll never know
Cause she get down on us, scrub the ground on it, with no shame
Give her time on it, roll around on it, do her thang
I ain't the type to trick, but she go hard for the cause
Type to bust it open wide and have me close down the mall
We ain't, gotta take it slow, she's-a hit the door
Let it show, for the give and go, get it on the floor
Woo, ayy, shake it like you never ever got to shake it
If pussy popping was a college, she done graduated
She need a bow for that ass just to celebrate it
A lot of clapping and a standing ovation when she—

Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me one more time (Oh)

Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah (Ah, ah)
Make a nigga spend his cash (I do love you)

I be in the streets with my woes
And I be on the creep all the time with these hoes
Can't help that I'm a freak and it shows
See I be eating pussy, kissing titties, sucking toes
Million-dollar nigga since a young'un
And if the police coming, then I'm runnin'
And if I go to jail, then my baby post the bail
Nigga, nigga, I ain't worried 'bout nothing
She got some ugly-ass ways
Aww, but she sure look fine
She know how to blow my mind
When she drop that ass for me like it's 1999

Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me, one mo' time (Oh)
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last, yeah (Girl, you know you bad)
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah (Ah, ah)
Make a nigga spend his cash (I do love you)

You know I love you, shawty, or maybe I'm just kidding
But the way you pop that, pop that pussy, shit I'm all up in it
Tightly fitted, bounce that ass up, got to climb up the pole
If she ever hit the stage, I'ma be at her show
Cause she my favorite life, favorite type
That bust-it-open, bust-it-baby, but she ladylike
Ooh, I'm talking head wraps and sundresses, heels for her flexing
Ain't no time she won't lend me that box, it need stretching
On the late night
She got the kind of glove to catch me if the play's right
That fly you out, you and that ass have a safe flight
And I'ma be there when she lands
Cause she never stood a chance in that bowlegged stance
Told her—

Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Back that ass up like it's 1999
Pipe it up and drop it for me one more time
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah
Make a nigga spend his cash, yeah, his last, yeah (Girl, you know you bad)
Girl, you're working with some ass, yeah, you're bad, yeah (Ah, ah)

Subenstein (My Sub IV),4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive

Caught you on the creep while everybody gone to sleep
A dog off the leash (woof!) the only way it speak
Motherfuck all them tweeters, that's the same for police
I never tone it down on some round in the streets
Come alive with the ball, crack curb by the yard
Bust the seats out the back, 
a monster's in the car!
If the monster went and start, it only come in large
Come alive for the star, but it came from my garage

Trunk knocking when I drive, my sub came alive
Transformer in my ride, my sub came alive
When them hoes outside, my sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
My sub came alive
(It's alive!) My sub came alive
They saying bass died, my sub came alive

Automatic quake make em' automatic shake
It's hard to feel your face, way on Mars feel the bass
Make a Martian, make Earth a target to get a taste
Ain't no room for yo' busted luggage, I'm out of space
In the trunk once it start to thump, I can't turn it down
It's too live for the pictures on your wall to survive
Outside talking, keep it quiet, I'ma kill your vibe
15s like it's Frankenstein, watch it come alive

(It's alive!) My sub came alive
Then I heard ""boom!"" from the amplifiers

Oh my sub, it knock and it bang
From the lows to the highs, it shakes the whole frame
Of the old school whip, it swang whenever I come through
I've been basing all night long
My sub won't do me wrong
All night long
My sub keep subbing on

Cause when I'm outchea on the creep for a speaker freak
Let me, let me EQ all her lows just to hit her peak
On the light, backrub in the backseat, tweeters where the stash be
I can't hear no lames over this bang, so please don't ask me
'Bout turning down, all this all this sound that it surround
Fuck the law, I'm gon let it bang til' it crack the ground
Bending curves, swanging and I swerve on the boulevard
Only me and God and you could never ever turn the knob

Oh my sub, it knock and it bang
From the lows to the highs, it shakes the whole frame
Of the old school whip, it swang whenever I come through

Everybody, everybody, get your glow on
Everybody, everybody, get your glow on

I put the piece on chain, I did that shit for the haters
Made in the image of greatness, I got that there from my maker
Skipped over the minor leagues and took that shit to the majors
Fuck all that salt they was tossing, sauce got plenty of flavor
I'm on my shine like a chrome grill when the sun out like gold spill
That plate on the time machine that sat on some chrome wheels
For all of them busters that's faking front like they for the cause
Blocking the shots you taking cause they know you 'bout to ball on these hoes
King Tut with the gold
, skating all on the low
Prison system enrolled, big time hope that you choke
All that bullshit that they serving
I come from where you whip it in the kitchen 'til it's twerking out the pot
Put my faith in God even when it's dark, I won't stop
Flip them high beams on, hit the gas to the top

Pull up, subwoofers still quaking, let it be known that I made it
From the box that they put me in because of my Nubian skin
Now I rollerskate in cul-de-sacs on twenty twen twens
Oh Lord, there goes the neighborhood
I'm whipping and dipping, the law won't stop me but wish they could
But the tag hood, digi dash good, nothing wrong here
Big bank, fuck what you think, I belong here on these
Hoes, ain't nothin' stopping me on my mission
Set my team up, raise my ring up if you play our position
Out the park when I swing, it don't matter who pitching
Boobie Miles under lights, hater this God-given
I can't wait on the government, got to do it myself
Stack all my chips up, never gon' slip-up case my folks need some help

Drinking Sessions,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Yeah, yeah
I got these ideas, I got a lot on my mind
And it's so hard to put 'em in a lot of songs
I try to put 'em all in one, you know
Just what I'm feelin', what I'm goin' through
I've been drinkin', so please bear with me

Eyes wide shut, barely eatin', tryna get my game on
Played it too cool, almost like I'm froze, had to turn my flame on
All the while, watch 'em X me out
Magazine cover, mothafucka, I ain't tripping
My flow, senior citizen shit
And maybe they'll listen to me when they sixty
Breakin' some bread down, treat it like the Last Supper
Toast to all the time we were po', but still we had one another
Hoppin' in, out of shuttles, I'ma be big, momma, I'ma get rich, momma
I'm sorry, I ain't got a wife or kids momma, but look what I did momma
Got a house that I barely can stay in, a car I barely can drive
I'd be a liar if I said gettin' money didn't make me feel alive
Hustlin', arguin' about who’s better than I in tweets
But what does it matter when a new artist come out like every week?
And the label all on they nutsack, good for them, keep suckin'
Most rappers'll bend over for you, but me? Bitch, I'm not for fuckin', over
I'd be the biggest star, they told me
Signed my name on that line and when I die, that's when it's over
Movin' on to the set, I was just a talented black kid
But to them, I looked like a check
Another five years of slavin' and then it's on to the next
I was tryna be what I envisioned as a child
A king ain't a man of God when ain't no church in the wild
Shit been fucked up 'cause they don't talk about Christ
Everybody trying to die young but who gon' talk about life?
I pull that card, good Lord, 
Confederate flag, shit so flawed
They used to fly it like pilots and burn crosses in our yards
I can't get with ya if you with that whistlin' Dixie they want that old time back
But niggas got a hundred rounds and automatics so we ain't having that
I ain't promotin' no violence, it's people out here been wildin'
So much that you can get gunned down just for being happy and smilin'
Ain't no hotline worth dialin' to say the world needs help
We too busy fillin' our needs that we might kill us ourselves
I got my gumption from my granny, had a dream about her like last night
She held me tight and told me, ""Little one, everything gon' be alright""
My mind playin' tricks on me, but I needed that there
In a world where I feel all alone sometimes I'm needin' her care
It's hard to share my insecurities so I medicate, I mean meditate
And pray to God for a second chance, for Heaven's sake
I'm just waitin' on a sign or two, like what I'ma do
When my heart get rusty and tired and it ain't shinin' through?
And I think about death a lot, my father scared of dyin'
I can relate,
 I call him before every flight, in case I ain't meant for flying
I can't hold it back, can't control these tears, I mean after all these years
I'm still the kid writin' poems, too shy to eat in the cafeteria
I'm two cups in and three shots away
From givin’ a fuck about any of the shit that I done had to say
Lord knows, it's hard to see the truth with your eyes closed
It's hard to protect your feelin's when you so exposed
Yeah, I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed

I let it all slip away
And now all I can say
Is here's a toast to a better day
And the love that will come and stay
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
Oh God, oh God, oh God, wherever You are, yeah
I call Your name near and far
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
I'm so exposed
Oh God, oh God
Oh God, oh God

Bury Me in Gold,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"All I ever wanted was a gold chain with that gold ring
Twinkle twinkle 'cause they gold, man
Candy paint with the gold flakes
""Stay gold,"" said Granny as she smiled with her gold teeth
I got a goal to be golden like King Tut
Often those pictures of that gold, they would flicker
Make it hard to call me nigga
'Cause the chains ain't the chains they chained us up with
This rope ain't the rope they hanged us up with
24K gold face with the rollie
Invisible set with the grill, that's how gold taste
Jordan 7s, golden moment with the gold lace
Gold time, gold mines with the gold gates
If I die, bury mine in a gold case
Slow down, never mind it's a gold chase
Goin' for the gusto in a gold place
May God forgive my sins for a gold space
Krizzle

Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the boat man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

I had a partna that went gold on the track and field
But the gold never shined in our atmosphere
Gold bottles, I ain't talking about the champagne
Malt liquor, sippin' gold helped us maintain
Hood niggas watching Goldie like that's us
Baggin' up the gold dust with the laws rushed
Snitchin' on them golden boys with the gold trust
Represented by the lawyers with gold cuffs
They order sweet potato with the gold crust
At the same restaurant with the gold judge
That hate the confidence and shine that the gold gives
So we take away your freedom and your golden years
The only time you see your mother's golden tears
Like, what good is gold if you never here?
What good is gold that you never wear?
I hope it pays your way on a golden pier

Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case the boat man doesn't know me and claims that I owe
And he claims that I owe, Lord, Lord, bury me in
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Just in case I'm forsaken and I have to pay for my soul

And this song isn't meant to be a glorification of gold
But the understandin' that even if I could take all of this with me
That I’d give it away to get to heaven
I’d give it away to see my grandmother again
I’d give it away to be at paradise and be at peace with myself
Big houses, nice cars, all that stuff cool
But it's materialistic things that we strive so hard for
As human beings, and it's not fulfillin'
It doesn’t take away the pain, it doesn’t take away the loss
You have to search higher, you have to go higher for that
The higher power, that higher energy
And that’s what I’m striving for
So in the event that I go and you have to bury me
You can bury me with all these things
And as soon as I see my Maker, I would give it all back
I’d give it all away because it wasn’t nowhere near as important
As being in Heaven and bein' at peace
Believe that there, believe that there, hah
Bury me in gold, hahaha
That's the rapper in me just wantin' to do the hook one more time
Bury me in gold, bury me in gold
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Peace to everybody, man, stay blessed
God bless, we love y'all",https://genius.com/Big-krit-bury-me-in-gold-lyrics

God fed up with my soul so ain't no blessin's
Happiness can't be bought or sold, I learned my lesson
Now I see what fame will really get you;
Bottle by the nightstand, that ease the stresses
Dealin' with depression, pills on the dresser
Fiendin' for affection so I'm buying out the section
Now I see what fame will really get you

Lifestyles of the rich and famous
That lifestyle left a lot of rich folk brainless
To the temple, 
yeah we were broke but that life was simple
Besides, food is food, water is water, air is air, the rest is mental
I did without until I did within
I said on beat what I wrote in pen
I gave my all without givin' in
But it's a thin line between heavenly divine and a livin' a life of sin
Speak in codes to my worthy friends
Greenroom full, I pray we ain't let the devil in
A lot of faces I don't know, a lot of ""where you been's?""
Like you was really lookin' for me when I was in the wind
Life is just a game now, I really got my aim down to shoot for stars
I ain't been to church in years and it ain't even far
This ain't even half of the battle, I ain't even start

I bought a bottle just to soothe my soul
Still crying over granny, that was some years ago
I'm a man now,
 I came up to hold my fam down
Can't tell them about my depression 'cause most them fans now
Got to protect myself at all times
I know some partners that been sued by their bloodline
Lord forbid I let my blood down
The first time I say no, guess we ain't blood now
Scared, me as a businessman is like all they see
Justin Scott trapped as Big K.R.I.T. screamin', ""It's really me""
When it was only us it was only love, how could this be?
When fallin' out for some is not gettin' the V.I.P
And a simple conversation means we talkin' work
To play a song that's almost perfect but it need my verse
You got an artist, but I'm family, but you need a purse
You hit the city but don't call me first, that's what fame gets you

Get Up 2 Come Down,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

Back at it one mo' 'gain
Cranking my motor, revving my engine
Chilling the AC 'til it's colder than a breeze in Alaska
Sun shine like the wintertime just passed us
Watching for laws and jackers
'Cause this shit here too clean to be taken
I keep it tucked off in my clothes
You'll never catch me out here buck-naked
Fresh drawls, them deadstock Js for the caskets
Pressing up on these bastards that owe me and I gots to have it
Wake up and cake up 'cause it's only right
Soon as the sun go down, the freaks come out
And they gon' dress in something tight
I'm tryna dig deep, ginger ale and Hennessy
It keep me in the zone, all night long til’ the clock strikes twelve
One more then I'm out of the front door
On a mission like a Waffle House cook for the 2-4-7
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

This for those playas in those gator belts
Getting cheese like patty melts
, serving up game like help yourself
Refereeing, calling plays on the sidelines
Super the bowl, diamonds and gold, won a ring like five times
I remember wanting to be that cause I seen it
Don't ever tell a hoe you love a hoe if you don't mean it
Unless it's bout that paper paper, got that from a playa pimp
They say it's work to be a P-I, easier to be a simp
Put it in motion, rollercoasting, peep the focus of a go-getter
If you flip it once and get it, it for sure figures
If you ain't eating with your squad, you's a hoe nigga
That's from the heart, 
never pump Kool-Aid when we on a mission
That's 24/7 like a waffle cook in a Waffle House kitchen
Man, I'm just trying to get paid
And make it where these mothafuckas hate
I got up to come down

Trying to get up to come down
Got that playa shit by the pound
The gold with the lacs and the crown
Make it where them hoes come around
Trying to get up to come down
Booming like a sub-underground
The whole city hearin' it's around
We all on the get up to come down

Now here's a little story that must be told
A wild young nigga off on Campbellton Road
I was raised on Kingsridge where there weren't no rules
Robbing niggas for they Starter jackets and shoes
Yeah, I've done some real things, family full of fiends
Forty ounce of Old English and some Newport kings
Went from a pocket full of pieces and '74 Caprices
A Benz and a crib in Buckhead, thank you, Jesus
Boy I'm Sweet James Jones when I'm whipping a Biarritz
A Rollie on my wrist and a super bad bitch
And you know it's southside, you can tell by the color
Give it a good look cause there'll never be another
Hoes, a hundred spokes, what you expect?
And trust me, money can't buy you that respect
Gotta feel it out of love, and get it from out the mud
And it'll come round, or get out the way
I'm coming down
[Outro: Big K.R.I.T. & 
Sleepy Brown
]
Trying to get up to come down
Young playa worldwide, third coast all day
Mississippi well connected everywhere mayne
""4eva N a Day"", 4eva howeva, 4eva anyway
You know how it be mayne
When you all the way down in the game underground
Trying to get up to come down
When you come up off that thang mayne
Them people can't stand you mayne
They can't, they can't get with it mayne
Cause they don't realize how or what it took
To get to a place where forever is a mighty long time
And all that time, you was doing it big
Trying to get up to come down
Somebody get fitted
4eva is, 4eva was and 4eva we will be
Multi til' the muthafuckin sun die
K-R-I-T, King Remembered In Time, believe that there
Trying to get up to come down
So as the beat keep rolling on, the slab keep hitting that
808 keep going on and the bassline keep being filthy and slashing
This is forever ever lasting in a timeless fashion, beitch!",https://genius.com/Big-krit-get-up-2-come-down-lyrics
Higher Calling,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

Pick up when I call ya', I'ma be there in a second
Need directions when you get this message, somethin's goin' on
Earlier this mornin', had a feelin' that we might've hit the ceiling
And our purpose ain't fulfillin' in this home, so
Maybe we should take some time on it
Put a groove on, and bump and grind on it
And get our mind right, the stars align like our very vessels
And I know that we ain't planets but I'm knowin' somethin' special
Comes from callin' Heaven, dialin' seven's, waitin' on a pickup
Stomach bigger, skin is glowin', girl I love your figure
This is simple, this is real, somethin' to remember
Had to hit ya, so we could blend such a lovely mixture

It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

Pick up when I call ya, I was starvin' for your garden
And I heard that you was thirsty, this is perfect, I got water
We could plant a seed and grow it, won't nobody know it
'Til' you showin', overflowin', overdoin', double soulin', hey
This ain't 'bout no bill collectors askin' you for time
Sally Mae can't get connected when you on this line
This is private, this a island, this is more than bein' worth it
This is callin' when yo' lights go out and they start back workin'
This is unexpected, such a blessing, had to tell you to express it
You wouldn't feel it if I texted no emojis were selective
Because I'm serious 'bout this here
Signal strong, I'm clear about this here

It's like, I treasure each night
To know that you exist
In the midst of all this shit
You are my higher callin'

Hydration
Meditation, elevation
Celebration
Levitation, this is elation
Higher callin', higher callin'
Ooh, we got a higher callin', higher callin'
Higher callin', higher
Higher callin', higher",https://genius.com/Big-krit-higher-calling-lyrics
Ride Wit Me,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Say, R.I.P. to Pimp C, he was the King of The South
If you hating on that, you need to shut your fucking mouth
I'm down with Lil J til' the muthafuckin' grave
Disrespect, they gon' put your picture on the front page
I'm center stage shining in a foreign you ain't seen yet
Chrome look like water, and my candy paint is lean wet
Don't forget the rims, them muthafuckas a clean set
You can't tell me that this ain't cost ya boy a mean check
Looking like a G in here, been here I'm gon be in here
When it's over, I'ma be the only one you see in here
Repping P.A.T. in here, realer than these other guys
I'm triple OG bitch, don't let them tell you otherwise

Young nigga out here on the rise
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me
Smoke something, hold up, hold up
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me
Smoke something, hold up bitch

Put Multi on the mountaintop
Drop the label just to raise the stock
You ain't seen a trunk until it pop
Full of 15s that'll make it knock
With them neon lights that say
Get in line or get down hoe
If it wasn't about the player money to be made
What the fuck you come around for?
This is big business, talking skyscrapers
Screens rise like smoke vapors
Candy paint's when it's Now and Laters
Bitch, I'm on the up like an elevator if you didn't know
Shine the grill just to let it show
On them emotional mothafuckas in the game
Tucking they nuts while I'm letting mine hang
Chromed out the rim, letting em' swang
Went from have-not to having some dames
Diamonds out the window, gripping the grain
One finger'll put the sun to the rain
Uhh, ya'll niggas thought I wasn't gon' be a king like I'm sposed'
But I learned from UGK, Multi, ""4eva N a Day"" on these hoes

Young nigga out here on the rise
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me
Smoke something, hold up, hold up
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me
Smoke something, hold up bitch

This for all the underground, we on the surface
South been holding, remote controlling
Got the game and it ain't for purchase
Ain't no hurting when you win, up the cut like in it
Touchin' down on it, clown on it, cheerlead if you wit it hoe
Old school on its tippy toes, chop the base and shave the doors
Fade the top, then let it show, how it taste? I got to know
Ice the grill, cold enough to freeze the snow
Bruce Lee, boy, sho' nuff that bumping dragon bitch I got the glow
Got the cake, smash it in your face, I got more to make
I'm on the chase for a bread truck to put off in my safe
And let it bake, stingy with the flakes, all the crumbs get ate
Off the plate, sop it up with the lobster, shrimp, and steak
Krizzle

Young nigga out here on the rise
Young bitch, you really need to ride wit me
Smoke something, hold up, hold up
Young nigga out here on the grind
Young bitch you need to get live wit me

Tired of seein' my pops go to work
Can't wait 'til the day he can lounge
Promise that I do it big

I had to be out
'Cause we've been cool since grasshoppers and there's no doubt
Can't chill out on the post, so please don't say that we not
The type that have to move on
Since the King up and died, and the Blues gone
So, I'mma skip my feet and up my fee and make some moves
Long as I hit the road, and break the mold, I never lose
I don't do this just for self, I do this all for you
Yo mama', daddy, sister, brother and ya' cousin too
And all them country folks who never settled fo'
That average shit they throw us out on the daily
I know we better though, I watched award shows
I swear they haven't talked about us outchea' lately
Unless it's negative or irrelevant
But I never ever ever let it phase me

You know that everything you are made me

I'm sorry that I left you but I had to
You can be sour all you want but we'll have you
Sweetened on the low, we've been bitter and it shows
Perhaps if the willow stop weepin', it'll grow
But I guess we'll never know
I just keep puttin' on it, Southern tonin'
Heard through the grapevine
 and a couple songs
Some of yo' fam hatin' on me, I'm never home, I know you lonely
Even if the sun shinin', it's still stormin'
I know they left us on the dock and kept goin'
I'm knowin' when you think I might go and do the same
I can promise I do the job and come back again
When my casket drops
I love you for your cool off and the cast is not
Why wouldn't you cheer me on if I had the shot?
I thought you wanted what's best for me so how could you ask me to stop?

Aux Cord,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Yeah, just pass the aux cord man
Yeah, just pass the aux cord
Heh, yeah yeah

I'm just tryna play that fly shit, Sly Family Stone ride shit
Even if you don't smoke, get high shit
Laid back like this that, this that, this that vibe
Finally got off work like this that, this that ride
To vacation, across 110th Street was blazing
For the motherless children that related to Mahalia
I know, you tired of that you can't feel it in your heart
Let the music be your secret lover like Atlantic Starr
New Birth, Wildflower was that jamming shit by far
And Eddie Kendricks' voice will have you singing in your car
I know, I know, I know Marvin played at your home
But that's the reason why your parents had to get it on
That's the reason why you're probably here anyway
Don't fret, you can play that bullshit any day
But, I'm just saying it's a whole catalog
Of analog, the warmer sounds you've ever saw
Pass the aux cord

You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord
You ain't jamming, you ain't jamming
Just pass the aux cord

Instant Vintage, might as well, that Raphael Saadiq, yeah
Voodoo moved your soul, Cruisin' was made for L-U-V-ing
Badu food for thought, eat out her Appletree and
Jill Scott forever golden, R.I.P. B.B. King
Prince and MJ that we played, barbecue to death
Summer shine, summertime, Will Smith and Jazzy Jeff
Willie Hutch scored the mack while Foxy Brown was slept
Billy Paul, Me and Ms. Jones, I always knew she crept
Barry White, Love Unlimited for the Soul Brothers
Ohio players and heat wave for the Cole Brothers
Funkadelic, Minnie Riper through the speakers
Bill Withers, Johnnie Taylor, cheaper just to keep her
David Ruffin and The Temptations
Christmas time, Silent Night, Gladys Midnight Train kept the Pips waitin'
I'm saying, we can go and chill on that other shit
And join the Parliament, mothership
With this aux chord

Music on another level
Let this eargasm take you to Heaven
And get you high
Waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
You're waking me up
You're taking me higher, ohh
Keep waking me up",https://genius.com/Big-krit-aux-cord-lyrics
Everlasting,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Everlasting
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

I know this sound like one of those love songs
Perhaps it's on time since all the love's gone
And we trap it out, trap it out, but you don't like hip hop
'Cause you don't know what they rap about, nowadays I don't know either
But I ain't like most people
I'ma hit you with that ""How you doin'? What you vibin' to and can I vibe with you?
And if the world was filled with flowers surrounded by waterfalls
And mountains despite the fact I just met you, can I lie with you?""
Shit, we outside the club though
And I'm knowin' what I'm sayin' make you wonder what I'm at the club for
To tell the truth I barely go out
I know your homegirl, she kick it with my partner, I tagged along with 'em
And they knew a friend that had a friend that I should meet
She don't like clubs, but she fall through sometimes just to see
So I'm guessin' that you her, it's just you and me
Let's skip out on this waterhole and find a place to be
In peace

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

Ayy, excuse me shawty, if you don't mind me
Pointing out the fact you're just my type
I mean my type like when God broke the mold and designed you
From head to toe He know I'd fall in love with ya at first sight
I know that ain't no gangsta gangsta shit but I figured you hear
""I'm a hood nigga, fuck with me, damn you bad shawty"" all the time
Don't get me wrong, that was me as a teenager
But I'm grown now and I think you deserve a better line
But not ""line"" like spit game, more like spiritual flames
To ignite the natural high that we all got
I know your homegirl told you don't fuck with us country boys
'Cause we players, but we all not
Now I admit I ain't perfect but who is nowadays?
A man can break your heart all sorts of kinda ways
But if you take my number down and hit me when you home
I can promise you I ain't shit like Tyrone
Excuse me shawty

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm asking if the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If the chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is everlastin'
If this chemistry we got is, I'm just askin'

Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty
Excuse me shawty

Excuse me shawty
I saw you passin'
How 'bout we get stuck together like we off in traffic?
Even if you ratchet or you plastic or classy
I'm askin' if the chemistry we got is everlastin'

The Light,4eva Is a Mighty Long Time,2017,"Oh, oh
I'm comin' home
The night is young (in America)
Oh, shine your light

For me when I'm out in the streets
Ends justify means when you makin' 'em meet
When you losin' the sleep that you sayin' you need
But what good is rest when it's family to feed
When it's money to get, when it's dollars to count
Fuck a job, you never raised for larger amounts
Keep the lights on, front door locked
'Cause the villains in the wilderness, lotta George Zimmermans
Damned with some innocence
So that mean he still out on the prowl for a black child
While the judge and jury crack smile
, Lord
Keep the lights burnin'

Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I'm out on the creep
Do whatever to get a meal when you barely can eat
I'm determined to fight the power to further the peace
Mama scared the police might make a point out of me
It's gets hard to sleep livin' life in a daze
When kings wanna be niggas, I hope it's phase
Queens down to be hoes as long as they paid
Chained to our oppressor, I'm knowin' we slaves
Who wants to be saved
When they claim that the prayers that we pray go unheard
In these God-forgotten days, just in case
Keep the lights burnin'

Oh, I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say, say your prayers, shine your light
For me

For me when I barely can smile
And the sun refuse to shine when I'm out in the wild
And the raindrops tap the window pane on my room
Scared I lost faith, pray I find God soon
In a world full of alt-rights, I was left field
Black man born poor, I was black steel
Black man born free, this how blessed feel
Because my dreams are dreams, don't make them less real
Nightmares are still the same thing
I've fallen from grace, wishin' I had wings
Like a dunk in the summer but I ain't had spring
'Cause all that runnin' from trouble'll give you bad knees
Now how can I make a move without a play
I got freedom of speech but with nothin' to say
'Cause all that workin' for somethin', but they barely can pay
What the glimmer of Heaven giving me every day
So I wade in the water
Filled with the sharks, snakes, gators and piranhas
To the higher, higher ground of the mountaintop
Away from the shooters that's down for shootin' to take a shot
'Cause they believe in everything they ever heard
From the bigots and racists that twisting every word
So, a hotel balcony could be the end
Or a podium speakin' to family and friends

So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burnin' for me
So won't you keep that light, light, light
Keep that light, light, light, light burnin' for me

I'm comin' home
The road is long
The night is young
The night is young
Somewhere in America
Say your, say your prayers, shine your light
Say your prayers, shine a light
Shine your light, for me
For me, ohh
For me, ohh",https://genius.com/Big-krit-the-light-lyrics

"My Sub, Pt. 3 (Big Bang)",Cadillactica,2017,"Two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens, fifteens
I got two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens and I'm knockin' on these ho
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens

This is how it all started way back
First the boomin' voice then the bass crack, 808
And that's when we first started fire
Cause the speakers wasn't grounded and he fried all the wires
But he thought about the thump from the jump
Took it out the bat cave and he threw it in the trunk
And that's evolution for you peeps
Like this is how I'm supposed to get freaks, 808

Hoes can't twerk to the high hat, never
Cranking up the knob till he broke off the lever
Subbin' on these hoes, give a fuck about the treble
He could barely feel his face but he hit 'em with the bass like

Two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens, fifteens
I got two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens and I'm knockin' on these ho
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens

Now this is how it all started way back, way back
Your neighbor, neighbor, neighbor, neighbor's hate that, 808
Basin' through my city like a junkie beat, junkie beat
With my trunk talking to you, bitch you better speak, 808
Pull up to the club and I kill shit, kill shit
Bitch you gotta be dead not to feel this, 808
My cousin passed his Alpines to me, to me
Like this is how you supposed to get freaks, 808

Hoes can't twerk to the high hat, never
Cranking up the knob till he broke off the lever
Subbin' on these hoes, give a fuck about the treble
He could barely feel his face but he hit 'em with the bass like

Two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens, fifteens
I got two fifteens, fifteens
Two fifteens and I'm knockin' on these ho
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens
Big bang ho, big bang ho
Big bang ho, I got two fifteens

No this ain't your ordinary subwoofer
Knocking down the pictures off the wall
I keep it crackin' in my trunk
Destroy your whole hood with that thump
That's if you want it like that player
Vibrate from M-I-Crooked all the way to Himalayas
Pandora box and custom made it
It's Sonic booming; Jackson State it
My trunk knock like Jehovah Witness
I made it to where haters had to play it
It's a really good fuckin' speaker do I have to say it?
It took me a year and some change just to calibrate it

Ain't nobody gonna stop this sub that I got in my trunk today
Crank it to the max till the pavements  start to crack
And the fuck boy law gives chase
Man hol' up I've been bassin' since bass been bass
The knob keep breaking and the swangers keep scraping
With these two fifteens wrecking shop all day
I'm bound to wake the block always

Yeah
Young Krizzle
Third coast
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I woke up like ""fuck these niggas man I gotta get mine""
You a hater by all means, there go a line
Ain't no need for new friends or these bickering hoes
'Cus wasn't none of y'all around when I was over the stove
You thinkin' bout dope, I'm thinking too cold
Fingertip froze, I been through the most
Look how it shows, look at these shows
I got to the highs for seeing the lows
You sayin' I changed but really it's growth
Fuck what you know if you ain't a game changer
Ol' commentatin' ass niggas all talk but ain't playin' never
Balled out the bleachers, you get shook if you reachin'
Bought a crib and whip off a beat and a feature
When you finally get this money you see just how they treat ya
When you get it out the mud you come up with some leeches
Never mind that, soon as I left Def Jam I got my shine back
I know they were lookin' at Sha like ""why you sign that?""
All the while I was killin' like ""go out rhyme that""
They claim they gave me a chance but I can't find that
Fuck it, lesson learned I earned the knowledge
The game's an open road and I needed the mileage
I'm fit for this here ain't no need for a stylist
I know that I'm better but really you bias
'cus you from the same city
As your favorite rapper favorite rapper, I can dig it
And you ain't tryin' to go to Meridian, Mississippi
And kick it, it's cool I spit that country shit worldwide
Let my accent be the reason for the wetness 'tween your girl's thighs
Foreign cars, Forgiato tires, top circumcised
Funny how niggas counted me out but I still multiplied
My worth, maximized that purse
Goyard or Hermes, whichever she want first
The only way I fall off, if there's no gravity on Earth
And even then I'm still amongst the stars
Better that than a game that trades genius for sub-par
Lifestyle for bars, if you didn't have that vouch would you have made it this far?
Imagine my shock when niggas come at my spot
That control shit was cool, but nigga look what I got
Mt. Olympus overlooked, barely spinning, game is rigged
It ain't no winnin' without no budget or no label, shout out to Sway
'Cus at least he'll bring up the fact that I still paved the way
When a lot of them wish radio was ""fuck I had something to say""
Not popular though, not popular music
I pray and give thanks, they don't like how I'm moving
But every time I drop a tape they like ""peep what he doing""
Then we package it all like I'm the first one to do it
Damn shame, damn shame, damn shame
Hol' up, yeah
Hol' up, hol' up
So imagine what could happen if I up and left
That's a lot of champagne bottles to leave up on the shelf
That's a lot of music droppin', shit that you ain't felt
Or playin' a championship game without a fucking ref
That ain't official, oh your album flopped? Well here's a tissue
There ain't enough streams that I could wish you to get that budget back
Oh, 'cus once you in the red you can't fade to black
'Cus you ain't Jay and ain't no blueprint to pay it back
I know your struggle and you can times that ten nigga because I'm southern
Oh you tired of being rich? I'm sorry for your troubles
But I ain't gon' tell these crate diggin' niggas there's no gold in the rubble
But there's a price to pay for being humble
Shaking hands with niggas that ain't yo friends
A lot of chameleons in disguise do whatever just to blend
It's amazing what a loser will go and do just to win
And all the tattoos can't hide the scales on they skin
I seen it, a game where people promise but don't mean it
And the dumbest motherfucker will make the world think they genius
Selling niggas water claiming it's the blood of Jesus
Although I was too young I probably was safer as a fetus
That's the will of my moms and pops
Instead she pushed me out like ""son, go and earn your spot""
Although there's plenty of nooses upon the treetops
I hope you find the strength and will to slip the knots, hol' up
I beat the block in that old school like I never drove through
I heard these niggas falling off, that shit old news
Back to my southern shit, I candy paint the slab
Got some player got some game, you need? you can have
Got the state on my grind, supernova the shine
Flip the screen out, lean out the window, recline
Show the grill, that's metaphor for fuck how they feel
The hate could never stop the champagne icin' on chill
If the champagne should spill on the candy
It symbolize the days I went being broke to door slammin'
I got mine now, made the beats and wrote all of the lines down
My sound is mine and mine alone, how could I leave it behind now?
Hol' up, ay
Hol' up shawty

Uh
Hop out the bed and I want me a chip
My flow a chopper, a beam and a clip
Stuffed in the trunk of a car with some thump
Why you jump out the window when there go a cliff?
I'm the ghost of the crack that was stuffed in the hubbas
Born to be king, you was meant for a rubber
I doubled a double cup I'm seeing double
And hut then nigga get the fuck out my huddle
Break, I seen it I seen it I see it clear
Being humble ain't shit when you being feared
I'm an old soul we ain't even peers
Niggas talking tough like I ain't even here
But that's how it go when you do the most
This ain't bout clubs or sellin' dope
I'm talking bout murderin' niggas on wax
And bringing 'em back like I seen a ghost
Fo' do', old dough, here I go Mystikal with the paint
Been bout it, been bout it, 9-5 minded we'll hop out the tank
Count it up, count it up, throw it in the safe I'm livin' in a bank
I come from the country, I know how to work the land
And come back with a mink
Frostbit cold wrist, this ain't nothin' new this some old shit
Barely used to wear it rather buy a mansion
Tossed it to my brother, you can hold this
Dry cleaner my demeanor when it come to benjis, can you fold this?
In the yo whippin' hella dope, that must be where the stove is

"My Conception - Freestyle over Nas - The Message, on Sway in the morning",UnKnown,2017,"My conception
I've been different and eclectic
I've done more than what's expected, that’s in a world with no perspective
That’s in a time with no perception
I made do with the lesson, the one or twos or the lesser
Had 25s on the dresser
Yessir'
Huh, huh
I'm talkin' lighters, no need for biters, and reminiscin'
I gave you knowledge they sold to me, hope you paid attention
That first class rank for me doe
Is to make eye contact with egos
That feel like, we don't be-long
Like looking at a ticket that make me, be gone
Fuck it I earned this shit here, I'm upgrading
I was comfy in my seat and you just made it
You was asking for a blanket I'm already faded
Jack and coke for all my niggas, that didn’t make it
Ough'
To the flight that I'm on
Mansion big enough for me and mine, the sight that I'm on
I'm a kid in the candy store, despite that I'm grown
Yeah
When it comes to this Rap shit
A lot of Whatchamacallits, Twixin', and snap quick
I guess the hunger for fame will make you back-flip
So while they’re Snicker and bickering, I know my worth
Like that last peppermint in my granny's purse
Or like a warm shoulder when I used to sleep in church
Or what I was destined to be as soon as my birth, king

So as far as I'm concerned, fuck these haters for life
They the type to fuck a hoe and probably pay for it twice
Take her out, ate her out, and after, got her a wipe
You only get a thumbs up when niggas have to go swipe
Past your shit
Now ask yourself if this what you want
Old half-ass niggas always do, but they don't
I really hate freestyling, feel like I'm tap dancing
But I'm Gregory Hines, I play the renaissance manner
Peeping my enemies
The story of a king, gets to sit by the river and watch 'em flow downstream
The art of war is never sleep with your stories
And bear arms, no bare palms, get porridge
I'm a southern motherfucker flip a east-coast flow
I'm the product of the slave that couldn't leave my coast
You got me fucked up, to think that you’re better
You couldn't expose a G if you Louis'd the letters
C.K.s, rang out
I'm a wolf with my fangs out
Hold up, Sway, I heard this where the sheep hang out
It's strange now
But stranger things still happen
In this upside down world we in, I'm 'bout that action
Talkin' seven, 7-Elevens, couldn't stop me
That's 539 one-times, copy
I seen it
I'm the Albert Einstein of Rap, genius
Mc squared
 most MC's yeah, I guess that's fair since everybody's god flow
I'm a titan, this rap shit 
I'm killing god's though
On Mount Olympus
, my 
penmanship
 is too pimping
You hesitating, I'm in your bitch crib, faded on the furniture you bought her
Player, I see ya
You fooled your main lady, but this shit IKEA
Fuck your couch nigga
I treat a pussy like it’s been through a drout, nigga
I flood the scene hit the showers then I’m out, nigga
Back to the benjis and money I'm spending
Play take the water, but twist me a lemon
Ain't talking social when a nigga trendin'
Why not ball when you come from humble beginnings?
Shiat', I dunk on Jordan
And tell Spike if he need acres shorty I got 40
In the South
And with the rest I put some golds in my mouth
Invincible, said it with the diamonds when I smile
Cause' Money Talk, word to Chris Tucker
Cause' one Friday ain't enough, bitch I need another

Yeah, makin' a move or two
Just to look at what these moves'll do

Bought a foreign just to go with the grill
Flip a coin just to blow off a mil'
Need a hiking trip to get where I live
Might hop in a Lear, take a flight to the Sip'
Just to check on the family, then back in this bitch
Just to mack on a bitch with immaculate tits on the low-low
Bitch, I'm selfish, the foreign ain't four-door
Bitch, I'm selfish, no I don't need no ho

Toss it up, boss it up, look what it cost ya

She take it, she take it all on her chin

Foreign, back from the touring

Overnight, Gucci bag, you back on that plane
He married, you mad that you got played
Think you run one game, he ain't called you since
Homegirls got change, but you called them lame
'Cause they got that foreign, they buy all they clothes
They don't need no man, but you still that ho
Every man you fuck with tryna sow his oats
Every man you fuck with fuck then catch ghosts
'Cause the cars they drive like a moth to flame
You ain't pimpin' the game, tryna fuck for change
Pick yourself up

Pick yourself up, ain't nobody helpin' no broke ass nigga
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga
(Pick yourself up, pick yourself up)
No broke ass bitch, no broke ass nigga, no broke ass bitch, no

Higher (King Pt. 6),TDT,2018,"Yeah, yeah

(The power) In a foreign car, hope it take me far
(The power) All I ever had, all I ever had
(Much higher) Smokin' on this gas but it never last
(Found God) When I'm in a jam, help me understand

(The power) To shed tears for me
(The power) To accept these gifts from me
(The power) The jewels that he did give me

(Whoa, God) The only thing she screams sometimes
(Much higher, higher) When she on her knees sometimes
(The power) Make it where she wants control
(The power) She lost it all some years ago

(My God) And send a hurricane again
(Whoa, God) And show how far a breeze could send

(The power) Was only on from the storm
(The power) Where I grew up was never home
(The power) You had to pay for it once you grown

(My God) Can forgive but I don't
(Whoa, God) Gave me wings but I ain't flown
(Much higher) Than the paper planes that I've thrown

1 Oh Oh,TDT,2018,"Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

Yeah, I wasn't perfect at all, but you picked up for my calls
You textin', you ask if I eat right
All alone without me you don't sleep right
Tossin' and turnin', your incense is burnin'
A lot of learnin' about each other now
We were best friends before we was lovers
So how could we bring each other down
I gotta be out, you need to breathe now, 'cause
We ain't on the same page, no
Ain't slept together in days, and
The hugs and the kisses turn to waves
The love that we had turn to pain
And you still hold it down 'cause you feel it
100 forever like really though, really

Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

A whole lotta understanding for sure
My time ain't demanding no more
You tryna figure out the best play
To be there for me in the best way
I'm tryna save you from the heartache
I just wanna smile like we used to
And maybe we can come back in the future
And find what we lost in the move and I mean that
Truly, I know what can happen when
You break the heart of a woman
The moment you capture it
And everything used to be passionate
Now it all feels like a accident
All of the years of imagining
All of the happenings
Maybe we rushing
But I knew I could trust you to keep it 100, 100

Yeah, this is how you run it
Had a bunch of choices, I'm the one you wanted
You was better off without me, but you still felt punished
Even when we broke up, she kept it 100, she kept it 100

She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
She kept it one, she kept it one

Watch for the birds, watch for them laws
Nigga they dirty as dirt
Trying to rough a nigga up, cuff a nigga up
Bust a nigga up, claim he got the work
Just because we flying flossed out
Never been a worker, always bossed out
When you come from the mud, you get it out the mud
Now look at what the mud cost now
Creepin' on A street, Cali Park
Knockin' these doors down after dark
Searching for a cornbread, collard green
Eating thorough bread, thick from the start
Got it from my mama mama, but tote the tool for the drama
But go to college for a education
They ain't fucking with you with no commas

That top and bottom, that's invisible set
Even granny had gold for real
Even granny had gold around her neck
Gotta let your light shine
Soon as they start hating at the right time
I went from 300 coming out hard, now I'm worldwide
Ask that, I was king way before rap
Came out the womb like fuck all the rules
If there was a bar then pass that straight where the cash at
Country boy tippy-toeing  (Uh)
25 on the dresser (Yes sir)
Did for the time, I freeze
Now batter that rustle, killing the pressure
Barely no effort, feel like a wrestler
Put on for the Sip', watch me out-rep ya

Going places in the South, buy land on the house

Look at the time I spent tryna whip up the foreign
Check on the stats, boy I'm scorin'
Swappin' these hoes out
Hit with no doubt but the pussy was borin'
Back to the slab
Wrist was hurtin', countin' too much money that I barely could dab
Chemist in the lab, stirrin' the glass
Fuck the Uber app, I call her a cab
Yellow the swag
All the wins I got, I throw in the bag
Dig a hole, buried deep in the ground
Water it once in a while, watch it grow into cash
All you got is L's off in your stash
Picture perfect with it, watch for the flag
Gettin' to the money, marathon running
High hurdle jumping, hundred yard dash

Fuck off in Vegas, catch me at the table, like, ""Who want a knot?""
Stiff arm the haters, Heisman the pose
Signal my nigga like I need a block
Touchdown, plenty time on the clock
Field goal ho, extra point for the top, good
Flood the diamonds in the wood, hood
Like the shooting guard for Cavs, splash
Early Tuesday morning, niggas still yawning, only time I deal with trash
Bag, only emoji worth textin'
Fuck the smiley face, missin'
One hundred, strong-arm
Checkmate, multi flex-flexin'

Big K.R.I.T., my nigga, I feel your shit
Been feelin' your shit since Felton put me on
I put him on Dot, he put me on K.R.I.T.  
Was here since then, nine years have gone
I wrote more songs than a man can count
Tryna figure out how to put 'em out
Without waterin' down my brand
I don't want 'em to not want my jams
Don't wanna become something that nobody wanna hear
But I recognize this as a bitch-ass fear
Why the fuck do I care if I ain't got your ear?
Then I ain't revered, if I ain't revered, then why am I here?
What if these songs you refuse to share
All due to the fact that you're insecure
Coulda helped somebody out there like you
See the world more clear, let me switch gear
Allow me to use this feature
To shout out one of the first fans that a nigga ever had named Felicia
I was brand new to the game, wasn't used to no fame
So it was unusual when I would land in a city and see you at baggage claim
Come to find out you was workin' for Delta
So you got to fly for the free and that means
That I was seein' you like every show
At first, it felt weird, but you was just so
Casual 'bout it and not some over-the-top fan
And that was just lettin' me know
""I really fuck with you, Cole""
Today I saw you post some terrible news as I scroll, so
This one is for you, want you to pull through
I better see you on the road

Those ""oh-so-wrongs"" done turned to ""You right""
And those ""oh-so"" days done turned to great nights
I been peeping and watching, waiting my turn
Since niggas ain't straighten up like a nappy-head mind his perms
Give or take, nowadays rappers like leaves in Fall
They wither away, nowadays I'm like scripture on Sunday
I’m giving them faith, doors is open, no ushers needed
The way I testify my fly, you think I'm preaching
The way I do this shit so big, you'd think I'm Meechi
All my niggas live real good, we call it geechi
Bless me, bless me Lord, no need for sneezing
Achoo, multi first, it's our season
I knew, I catch air without breathing
And bang on a mothafucka that doubted my leaping
Hol' up

And make it easy on yourself
And make it easy on yourself

Let's be honest, I'm better
I did it without the vouchers and feathers they tethered to keep you together
The distance I jumped off the porch just couldn’t be measured
Yo metaphors never make sense in the storm that I weathered
Undoubtedly, proud to be, I’m like lightning in a bottle
A country boy killing yo' favorite rapper’s bound to shock you
It's funny how faces scrunch when I swing like a Tyson punch
In that old school, my vocals blaring
Nigga, tell me you hearing the level I'm on
Put some bass in yo' tone
Southside, outside Multi lumni’, rep that shit 'til I'm gone
Sun die, sometimes when you stand out, ain't nowhere to belong
Winner's circle, build a castle, guess I'll make this my home
Planting flags, boast and brag, plus I'm stating my feet
You on radio, we do what told, they came to see me
'Cause I did it without a hit, my nigga, you know how it be
When it's real, no doubt, all this here come word of mouth
Put me in yo' conversations, whisper 'bout me like I'm Jason
Only rapper tell you go to church, keep it playa', motivate the nation
I'm a living work of art, ya'll niggas ain't even good at tracing
I'm so throwed in the game, I'm clearing all the bases
I'm so on another level, didn't even know you made it
Looking in the mirror at myself, I'm like ""Hi, The Greatness""

And that diamond in the back

I remember, I remember not knowin' where I came from
Until I realize where I come from
Proud parents, black parents, my parents
They standin' on the same steps that they supposed to
In the same place that they supposed to
And I'ma keep raisin' 'em higher and higher
And the biggest house I can find, I'ma buy it and buy
I'ma keep tryin' and tryin' to make 'em proud and all
That 2 Chainz song was right
Most things ain't never ever happen overnight
But when you tryin' fly a kite and you gotta make that flight
And you tryna make shit right
You do what you need to do
You get it done, you get it done
You're the only one, that can make it happen
So you had to make it and you had to run that marathon
High hurdles, jumpin', 40 yard dashin'
Watchin' it happen, makin' it happen
We should watch it sometime, them haters
But you get greater later (Shine)
My label was evened out
All my dreams are still profound
And I still get down, I get down, I get down
And you hear the sound? Move
Baby, I'm so southern I sometimes scare ignorant people's perception of independence

Bitch, I'm from Mississippi

Maybe I'm so southern I sometimes scare ignorant people's perception of independence
I'm from Mississippi
Bitch, I'm from Mississippi, hol' up
Maybe I'm so southern I sometimes scare ignorant people's perception of independence
I'm from Mississippi, bitch
I'm from Mississippi, get wit' it

Get wit' it

'Cause we get busy
Get wit' it, get wit' it
Bitch, 'cause we get busy

It was undeniable
I told you it'd be worth the wait, that's why I waited so long
Oh, I have never heard such a display of a magnificence in one record! It was amazing
It was none other than the Biggest of K.R.I.T., mm, from the flatlands of Mississippi
Every minute, worth waiting for
You could feel the spirits of the older blacks (No, which, oh my), resonating through the music, it was magnificent
He, it was magical
Probably some of the best things my ears have ever consumed
Instruments never heard before in such a manner
Oh my God, who was the fellow on the trumpet? Or was that a clarinet, or a saxophone?
Who knows (Who knows), it sounded glorious
It was a magnificent display of musical talent
The way the bant-dent-dent, I can do it, it was, amazing
Oh my God, oh, oh my, I just realized, now we must wait again
Lord (Oh my God), you are a madman

I've seen the land and all the seven seas
It's plain to see, oh, I

Three pointer in the corner, Ray Allen, I'm on it
Floater off the backboard, LeBron in the moment
Griffey at the plate, I ball with the fam
I'm Vince Carter in Toronto, I'm good for a slam
AI with the practice, I'm born with the gift
Michael Jordan with the tears when it got to a chip
Tommy Smith and John Carlos, I'm raising a fist
Gold chain, gold rings, no medal for this
Life's an uphill battle, no pedal for this
Closed curtains when I circle, I'll settle for this
Throw me a parade, throw me a parade
Roses at my feet, champagne I can taste
I am just a winner that my parents made
Flo-Jo with the mojo, you can't clock the pace
Floyd with the belts, too much for the waist

Formula 1 speed, I'm chasing myself
Swinging for the fences, diving for the inches
I did it for the chip, never for the mentions
Friday Night Lights when I'm on a mission
The finish line my witness when I go the distance
Stride, break a record 'fore I break my neck
Pride means nothing 'til you get respect
Time is a buzzer-beating shot
When the ball's in my court and I look up at the clock
Swish goes the net, Steph Curry-like
Serena with the racket how I'm serving life
Trophies on the way, trophies on the way
Endurance for my soul, cardio the faith
If I compete with me, there's no second place
If I compete with me, there's no loss to take

Foreign dripping with a bitch on the side

Like what the fuck is ever having enough?
We gon' keep keep baggin' it up
We gon' keep keep cashin' it up
I need this here for the inner city
I need Wakanda in Mississippi
I need to plot it and plan it
A way we could manage to stay out the penitentiary
I need a chopper for all of my partners
Just in case the government try to get me
This is bigger than the color green
This is Denzel in the last scene
Of a Spike Lee joint, Malcolm X story
Necessary by any means

I am a four, never pour, never sip
I got a dream

'Cause when you marinate the game in the sauce as long as I did
I'm supposed to eat now
Who shows receipts now?
Cards on the table 'fore they asked for it
Only crash dummies need a crash course
Put your ID away, they need your passport

Of model hoes that scatter blow

Count it up, count it up, with my kinfolk
Partition my vision in the limo
That's a long way from givin' niggas demos
That's a long way from keepin' up, keepin' up
Nah, I ain't sentimental
Family matters more to me than the Winslow
Dark night, no joke, I'm just hangin' out the window

If I come up, you come up
If I ball out, we ball out
If I'm poppin', you poppin', I got it, you got it

Open lane and they thought I should've passed it (Gone)
Zero to sixty, might just miss me
At the spot that you pay to come and see
They paid me to come and sit for free
So you could watch how we ball out every week
Sparklers remind me of the Fourth
Won my independence just to start a biddin' war
Cellphones rang out like some gunshots
Bang out in a Caddy with that iron, I'm just stayin' on course (Tiger)
I'm a master, no jacket (Master, no jacket)
I got green like a pasture
""You get a plate, you get a plate, you get a plate""
Unlike the ones from the pastor
Give and go so they'll never know
They say I can't take it with me so I give more
I guess that's why I'm 300 songs, 10 albums in
And I still got the glow
Bruce Leeroy, Sho'Nuff
Who needs a hero when they got us?
Multi 'til the sun die, a real
The only movie that you could've seen without a script

If I ball out, we ball out

She volleyballed all through college, now she just ball off the coke
It came in handy, she demand it, 'cause the techniques never vanish
She just stretch it, then she prep it, when she come down, perfect landing

I gave her a ten on my scorecard
She make that shit look so easy, but that shit hard
Had me lookin' around, like, ""Oh my God, did you see that?""
Can't believe that she in here when she could star

Yeah, I thought that you'd be ratchet, but you classic with your stance when you still
Why you here?

Fake friends that's flexing, bozos that message
Under my comments, all of this nonsense
I think I'm a martian, I'm tryna be honest
Phone me home now, in my zone now
Got a space modulator, leave me 'lone now
All the stars and the planets, and I'm worried 'bout a cop
That might shoot down the drop 'cause I took off in the lot
High beams
I remember thinking what good is a telescope if I could never really go?
And what if we just marbles in a jar and God is playing Jacks
And one day he goes and roll us all out the pack, sheesh, picture that

I'm supposed to go farther, go higher
Do more, then that bullshit that you told me to
I'm supposed to discover life wonders
Without wondering all that bullshit that you put me through
I'ma go outer space one time, just one time
I'ma go outer space one time, just one time
Watch me
I'm supposed to go to my job, and try to even my odds
Then go and sit in my car in all this traffic like
I don't even live all that far, we used to talk about Mars
We barely look at the stars, what happened to flying cars?
I'ma go outer space one time, just one time
I'ma go outer space one time, just one time

I remember all I ever wanted was a jetpack
So I could go farther in the hood that I would live at
'Stead of playing cops and robbers, probably should've astronauted
Might've seen another planet but we shooting pocket rockets
I'm just saying what's the plan?
We done spent too many days
Too many years, traffic jam
Way up, way up, way up there

Don't wait up, I'm way up

Soon as yo' song played in the front of the biggest crowd

Batman and Robin, they villains too
Jokers, they smile and they wave
Colorful hair but they dodging the fade
Never could surf but you riding the wave
Wire your jaw just to talk like Kanye

Bust down a chain just to feel like you made

Like I ran through the maze

I gave my heart for the funds, just give it back when you done
Who needs a flame?
Not talking Blue for the change
Back to the future with lanes
We ain't the same
You took me from where I came
Bonfire, more lighter, propane
Igniter, most higher, not tamed
Highest fire, one higher than they flame
No firefighter or water pilot could maintain
Subtle glimmer, grandma simmer from her pain
Hot perms, no naps in that grain
Slick back, off track like that train
On a late night, just help but no pay
The doubts fire, too tired to say grace in the summer

Too many times I seen private lives mans publicize
Tryna peep the message wit’ emoji eyes
Why the money bands go to suit and ties
And sell that same shit back to you and I
We watching wit’ our popcorn and drink
And talk about it all at the job we probably hate
Wishing that we was the one
Wit’ the cars and the girls and the guns, don’t we make that shit look fun?
Thinking back on all the shit that I did
Just a kid from the ‘Sip, yeah I come from the sticks
Where Stones is rolling like ‘is you holding base?’
The highs and lows where tweaking on 808s might blow yo’ face off
Nicholas Cage wit’ it
Joy and pain, Frankie and Maze wit’ it
Shout out them dope boys that told me I was better off rapping
Not with the trapping, if the ship sail, kidnap the captain
And force him to listen to the wave of a nigga that’s snapping
I swear my need to shine gave my mama contractions
Out comes K.R.I.T. and the outcome’s this
The way I turn fire in the flow I’m a alchemist
The way I whip up the sauce you can’t doubt my wrist
My Rollie told me ain’t been a time like this
Not even when the dinosaurs was roaming the earth
A caveman wit’ mine, bitch I got to be first
Keep what I kill, take care of the village I build
Multi alumni niggas know where I live
Branded, high and demanded
It’s all home runs from here, like they throwing underhanded
Shit, y’all know I don’t like freestyling
But it’s a long way from Def Jam linen closet
This a chess move wit’ checkers on the board
This that one time you realize all the shit you could afford
Like those gold BB, S’s, diamond necklace
Wood grain, foreign in rain, driving reckless
Louis lenses, bound to change your perspective
Dark skinneded, God body, Black excellence
Black queens, wit’ those cakes that’s too decadent
I had to come back twice
I told God I love my life and that this will suffice
Before I saw a flick from Spike I was doing it right, Krizzle",https://genius.com/Big-krit-big-krit-freestyle-la-leakers-freestyle-089-lyrics

Callin' it a bucket but I'm like ""Fuck it, this shit bangin'"" (Bass)
House with the speakers, level the tweeters, really don't need em
Rearview the mirror, always shakin'
If you behind me, I ca-ca-can't see ya (Bass)
I got 15 before I got rims, before I got paint (Bass)
Sound like I'm down the street and I ain't around yo way (Bass)
Hittin' so hard, I caught a charge and beat a case
They call the earth, the quake, the cover
A sleeping giant that to wake from my bass

Basshead, bass line, scrunch your face time
Break spine, take a marching band to make mine
Knockin' doors down, need the hand of God to take mine
You can't hear shit, 'less you heard it through the grapevine
Woofin' like a dog in the yard off the chain
Crankin' like a set, Imma let that bitch bang
All the sub, fuck the club, Imma tear it off that frame
Crank the trunk like it's thunder but you ain't seen no rain
It's just bass

Popped up twice with the lights for the show and it thump

If you got the juice, then I got the bass
The trunk got the shakes, the trunk got the shakes
If you got the juice, then I got the bass

This ain't no factory shit, I blow your back in this bitch
Might put a club in this ho', don't know how to act in this whip
I'm pressin' buttons, I'm diamond fisted, I'm Thanos-glovin'
Got plenty lettuce, ain't talkin' sandwich when I'm talkin' subbin'
Talkin' woofin, overheatin' like someone cookin'
Sound like a monster in my trunk, got it out the bushes
To the next I push it, the highs and the low
Neon they show, tippin' on fours, want bass? I got mo'
In the trunk

Take it up with my trunk (Trunk)

Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't sucking or fucking, get yo' ass out

Uh, niggas got shows to get to and shit
Yeah, no time for fucking around
It's the Planes and the Taylor Gang, yeah
Dash digital, situation critical
Hate to make it so blatant baby, but I ain't playing
Maybe you got me confused with one of them other dudes
I ain't none of them, under they breath mumbling
Scared to tell them hoes what it is, you put yourself in that position
I chill with all that baller fishing
You fucked around and you caught a shark
Cold heart, tear your feelings apart
I'm more focussed on getting my rims powder-coated
One of the dopest, I'm Schedule 1, you just ibuprofen
What is you smoking? Them bogus growings, they got you choking
The option's open, you can hide with them suckers
Or ride low and get higher than a muh'fucker

Don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't sucking or fucking, get yo' ass out

Uh, straight stunting, sucker niggas, I take from 'em
They bitches that is, get up in the car with Wiz
They know they gon' bake something, ain't fronting
Smoke it all, the eighth onion
Get it twisted cause you see me on your computer screen
Thinking cause you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything, in the fly we trust
Just by the smell it's obvious that my connect come from Cali
I'm good long as the money piling up
All the while I'm just quick lane pimping, big Jane twisting
Walking how I talk it, bitch that's Pittsburgh pimping
Yeah, bitch

Don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass house
If you ain't sucking or fucking, get yo' ass out

Yo, now I was candy coated, bending corners, fifth, fifth wheeling
Made a killing with the bumper grill and chandelier ceiling
Plush linen, is you fucking? Is you sucking? I was wondering
Cause if not, don't be pushing on my buttons in my cutlass
Unless you cutting, bitch I'm just saying, I ain't tricking
Is the reason that this porno flick playing, trunk shaking
Knocking pictures off the wall, southern mating call
808 mean no draws, you got friends, I fuck 'em all
What you mean you ain't nasty? Why the fuck you came?
Just imagine what you got to do to get up in my plane
Mississippi pimp, mouth piece frigid
Dolomite out of sight, show you're right, can you dig it shawty?

Don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass
Don't, don't you want to rest that ass in this glass house

Make Sense,K.R.I.T. Wuz Here (Remastered),2020,"I'm tryna make sense outta this

Walk out the door, check a temp outta this
Wood grain the car, chop a rim outta this
I don't think strip club, strip bub, could strip outta this

No cap, no tip
Follow that drip, just slide don't slip
All for the path, you belong
This life here's still for the strong
The good gotta keep movin' on
It's crazy how the world switchin' up like a light fixture
Might get ya lifeline touched
Callin' on the highs, what's your lifeline for
Pick up a little power that cower off in the dark, now your lifeline cut
Breaker, you gotta hit the breaker
We need to shape up, and I'm ain't talkin' about a taper
You need to wake up 'cause ain't no time for the snoozin'
Mobilize your mind in line and start movin'
Practice what you preach instead of the pit bullin'
Collection plate and water you wade in, leavin' you drowned
In world full of people, ain't nobody around
In case you didn't know I guess I'm tellin' you now

I never thought that I mink wasn't warm enough until this snowglobe was shook up
I know some players that procrastinated, laughin' at the doomsday
 paper, now they askin' for the hook up
The canned food that my grandma used to cook up
Never sold, now they barely on the shelves when I look up
Same restaurant that wouldn't sit us down for dinner cause of hats, sweats
Servin' out the window with some hats, sweats, masks, gloves
Scared of the type of shit that  might of would touch
First class and coach is all for the low
But what good is flyin' if ain't nowhere to go
Still fillin' up my tank 'cause gas ain't been this low
And the deaths of the world affect the fiscal scope of the stock market banking
It all got my thinkin'
Should liquor be the gold for a drinker?

I'm tryna make sense outta this
Roll up the L, catch a blimp outta this
Pour up the water, sell a ship outta this
I don't think a pimp could even limp outta this
 outta this, make sense outta this
Walk out the door, check a temp outta this
Wood grain the car, chop a rim outta this
I don't think strip club, strip bub, could strip outta this

All this time, did it ever cross your mind?
That you couldn't get down on it
That you couldn't get down on it

Never, ever could believe

Out the window, whip on limbo, sit at the tip top of that mountain
So many haters that watch my pockets, I stopped countin'
Deep sea blue, money might drain ya
Soon as I crown, then they crown me
I got love for all my day oner's but fuck you if you doubt it
On some real shit, put that on the dolla dolla bill shit
Who woulda knew that a creased and three-piece, something I can heal with
Sharp, debonair playa, caught a way to drink until tomorrow
Multi, do the dash, fuck the light
Do the throttle, you would think I hit the lotto
Like a rim in a pot hole, I made
Something outta nothing, I'm fuckin' role model

I can whip a track while I'm blindfolded with my hand tied, sittin' in the dark
That's the difference 'tween me n'em
Got it out the mud, them niggas skimmed off the top
You ain't have a vouch, bitch nigga stop
Talkin' catalogs, I done did a lot
You was just a pup, I was off the chain
Barkin' and scratchin' my way to the block
Dodgin' the fake love and the pound sweat
Ain't a fence or gate I didn't hop (Mhmm)
Trying to catch a break, it's funny how being hungry motivates (Mhmm)
Now I'm like David Blaine, on a Magic City Monday, make 'em levitate (Mhmm)
Talkin' 'bout low-lows on the old school if I ever gotta scrape

Pray the we'll survive on a bed of ice

When I'm on that propane
Fire water dripping through my cold veins
I can see my breath through the summertime
Frost bit fingertips, I pray never fumble mine
When you grow up in the South Pole
Niggas leave you outdoors if you don't keep your mouth closed
Icebergs sunk the Titanic, yeah
And loose lips do a lot of damage, yeah
The coldest day is when they leave you stranded
And you try to build a fire live a caveman
Send the smoke signal through the blizzard
Life is like a raft on a river
Frozen from the winter, waiting for the thaw
The ice grill never helped the locking of the jaw
Confetti in the club like the snowflakes that fall
That'll be the day I slip and everybody saw

Not even a Polo or a Timberland
 the height of the snow

Icebox heart feeling froze over
The first time I ever held a flamethrower
And this is how I chisel through the freeze
There's way colder days than 32 degrees
When you stay around bundled up
People cold year round, what the summer for
Spring time Mount Everest when you coming up
Make it to the top, look down, this ain't warm enough
Subzero temp, Northface fit
Vest for protection don't mean shit
When the breeze is cutting through the leaves
And they fall for the fall and my tears turn to sleet

Every now and then you’ve gotta pimp
Every now and then you’ve gotta ball
Every now and then you’ve gotta clean up

TV screened up and sit tall

Take that shit up with my trunk
If you really think I hear you over bass
Take that shit up with my trunk

I see through niggas like glass, why the fuck’d you shatter yourself?
On a mission for scrilla, chinchilla coats for the winter
I buy a crib with the pillars
And sit that ho in the villa
Vanilla bucket seats, with a busty freak, that fuck with me
She bob on top, but a nigga like you, she just can’t fuck for free
Well on the late night, I’m a great white in a shark tank
Your heart pump Kool-Aid on these groupie hoes, my heart can’t
Your boat sank so long ago
Your crew been jumped off, my shit sell ‘cause I stay afloat

Hold that thought, hold my coat, nigga ‘cause…

And what records you breakin’ to have this conversation
Where you live, what you drive, what’s in your bank account?
Your jive-ass 9-5 ain’t matchin’ my amount
I count my cars, count my broads
If you could count you’d know I’m living large
Menage with two TV stars
You dream about everything that’s ours
Hater, hatin’ on my gifts from God
Only gon’ block your gifts from God
So stop actin’ fraud
Congratulate and give me my award
Work hard an one day you’ll get your card",https://genius.com/Big-krit-now-and-then-lyrics
“Purpose” Big KRIT,"Vision, Imagination, and Purpose Mixtape",UnKnown,"*Baby crying*

I was born in '86, despite the wolves and rats
Survived the wild and returned with these bear furs on my back
To feed the family, drink the wine
Give thanks to God and watch for signs
The winter's cold
But we was chose to rise above the darkened skies
And fight against what lied beneath
My feet are firmly on the ground
Prepare my soul and grit my teeth
Fight or flight is going down
What man amongst me says
That I ain't fit to wear my Father's crown
A King of Mine and mine alone
My blood line can't be renounced
Stand up and be counted for
Raise your fist as Glory speaks
Heavens what I'm dying for
I swear the Devil's at war with me
I deal with life accordingly one day at a time
And that kingdom we all searching for
I pray one day we find
So many have long and gone
So many got left behind
But as time travels and Earth unravels
Church bells still chime
Planets still align as angels watch over
I break the chains they gave me
And put these medals on my shoulders
Cause I ain't no simp

You'll be different
You'll find comfort in family
Your power lies in your faith and beliefs
What's a king without a crown?
Or a kingdom to call his own?
This is purpose",https://genius.com/Big-krit-purpose-big-krit-lyrics

Somedayz I want to but don't cheat

Somedayz I don't trust you
Somedayz I don't hustle
You had a good day, and now you type bougie
Somedayz I'm like, ""Fuck you""
Somedayz it's alright
Somedayz it was so nice
Somedayz it was long nights
Cause somebody called my phone and they didn't say nothin'
Somedayz it was all fight
But somedayz I was trippin'
Somedayz I didn't listen
Somedayz I went missin'
When you needed me more than you ever, ever needed me
Hope some day you forgive me
Somedayz I act cool
Somedayz I'm that dude
Somedayz I don't choose
Between working all night in the studio with the groupie hoes
Somedayz it's just you
Somedayz I feel pain
Somedayz I like rain
Somedayz I hate fame
When a deal come around and the checks don't bounce
I'm scared someday I might change
Someday you might tease
Somedayz I won't see
Somedayz you throw keys
To the house that I bought cause I thought it'd make you happy

I Ain’t Shit,UnKnown,UnKnown,"""Go on get out of here with you goddamn philosophies and your judgments... Who the hell do you think you are?.. You are Loser, you ain't shit...You're a goddamn ??!!""

Ok not a moment to waste
, taste the hunger on my breath
I heard somewhere that stress was bad for my health
I ain't dead yet, pathetic maybe, 
my girl shady
Say I ain't stable, so she don't wanna have my baby
It's kinda crazy, Indeed she feels he'll be
A mothafuckin' threat like me, why not? I ain't that bad
My playa pizzazz was good enough to flip, smack and fuck her ass
But I think I'll pass on the goo goos and gah gahs
Rather fuck hoes that shake they ass like maracas
I think, she think I'm no good, got it from her mama
She always starting some shit, I think that bitch is drama
We never get along 'til I'm pulling on her thong
While I'm digging in her skin, ask me ""why I do her wrong?""
C'mon love let's do it one more time
You bound to get yours so I gots to get mine
Sing her a lullaby in the sheets, so that ass can go to sleep
While I plot and creep on paying rent this week
Might have to slang some dick to this lonely chick
Got a Benz, kinda fat, but she got big tits
(chorus)
I ain't shit
I think they wanna see me fail, laid out, played out fulla shells
Man I ain't shit
I'm hollering fuck a job for real, I think I might rob and steal
Man I ain't shit
Shawty homegirl like ""leave that dude,"" why she trippin'? I fucked her too
Man I ain't shit
I'm out here on my last dime, I think I play Xbox to pass time
I ain't shit

All I got is dreams of cream and mad green
Smoke 'til I pass out, live life supreme
Cartier frame Polo no stain
Still keep that heater underneath the woodgrain
Puerto Rican mamis that massage my body
Feed me fruit, suck me off in groups, call me papi
I was playa loungin', champagne drinkin'
Another hour woke up, fuck wishful thinking
Eyes full of crust, roll the blunt, shower up
Burn it down, what now call my nigga Buck
Asked him ""What's the move?"", Tell me what's the play?
I'm dowm for the caper just tell me where they stay
The ski mask way, never beg a borrow
If it go good today do the same shit tomorrow

Can’t Be All,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, Shawty
It's crazy though
Man this can't be just all I'm living for man
Ain't like I can take any of this shit with me when I'm gone
Go get money and get money and get money and then what?
You know what I'm saying
This can't be all to life

Another bill due, I feel to I can't make it
Inside I scream out loud ""Oh lord I can't take it""
Please, give me some time to make it through
Yeah I was short on my time but I paid my dues
Maybe, overlook my shortcomings
And if it ain't too much let a player hold something
Shoot me a blessing too on GP
Cause I ain't of this world you see how they treat me
Trap my soul in brains, keep invisible chains
Waiting to break the odds, still praying for change
Maybe it never will, 'til I shut my eyes
Travel through the abyss and meet you in paradise
On the other side where my ancestors stay
An underground railroad that never will delay
Man, I'm waiting on my bus ticket home
Don't let it be too soon but don't let it take too long
I'm scared of the future, what have we become
Our will just to shine got us blocking out the sun
The youth born grown with no knowledge of funds
The worries of the world I inhale through my lungs
Like this can't be all

This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
Money cars and clothes
White walls and vogues
Drank weed and hoes
That's all a nigga knows
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
This can't be all
Racism and suppression, no sign of regression
Single parent living facilities of correction
This can't be all

I can't survive off 9 to 5, look what they paid me
Enough to struggle more, modern day slavery
How can they treat me like this
I was the king of the junior high fling when I was 16
On the varsity team, I lead to squad and cut the broad that cheered for stars
That was back in the hallways
I skipped class all day
Friends with all the teachers so I made all A's
How stupid of I to waltz by
Didn't learn shit went to college and flunked out
Now I drown my sorrows in these liquor bottles
Spit game to hoes longing to hit models
Watching Wire reruns plotting to be Marlo
My time running out all I have is tomorrow
On the flow I curl, late nights I earl
The worries of the world
Like this can't be all",https://genius.com/Big-krit-cant-be-all-lyrics
Remember the Titans (DJ Booth Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Cinematic, Multi-Alumni ya dig...
It's been long time coming, Sam Cooking
No tap dancing, just check booking
85 driving, Soul Surviving
Its either stay where you at or start riding
Old School Cars, Automatic Start
Went through hell and back to get a house with a garage
I see it clearer than Blu Ray, you see when its too late
A source separation from bouquets
From bitches with bootays, that I used to love, used to fuck
Never kissed, but I held and hugged
On the low tho, loved them all, when they balled
Spend it all just to get me rubbed in polo
Do what I can through God will
Never slack in the DJ booth I flex skills
I break it downnn like pounds of drum field
Push niggas off cause 
I'm King of my hill
King of my Ville, Don't enter I'm tellin ya
Fuck you and yours plus I'm killin ya messenger
Favorite rapper rapper rapper et cetera
Forever in the kitchen whipping feats for my brothera bruh..
Aye food for thought I was cooking, maybe stirred but not shooken
They tryna see if I got it, so I guess I'm Reggie Bushin
n
Would appear I'm the favorite, mother fuckers be hatin
My mama told never say it but, yeah I'm the greatest
Like Ali without the shaking, history in the making
You thought I was a newcomer but baby you was mistaken
Murder beats in the masses, throw 'em in caskets
This plastic crematory flow, leave 'em in ashes
Candle light vigil, R.I.P. to beats
Must be something stupid fire deep in side of me
Honestly, you ain't fuckin with me
Krizzle be the truth, Even DJ Booth, had to be like what it do?
Look at you, ain't much time left, I think I should wish you well
For you no anticipation, I'm like 2 thousand 12
How much you tryna sell, perhaps you should find a shelf
To sit yo shit on, nigga I been flown
Back to the bottom of the south
With the mind frame to ride high, Golds in my mouth
Hollin out whats happenin'
Pullin bitches from corners to where you can't imagine
Straight jacket spazzin
Cashing out, King Krizzle who they askin bout
The cuddy duddy rollin dirty spray that apricot
Sun jealous told the moon that I.. have to stop
Cause you not even half as hot as the shit that flop
I bang bang like pop, til the chamber lock
If it was 1995 I'd probably hang with Pac
Cause I'm a Mutha Fucka, Neva Scared,Certified Bone Crusher
The way I spit the block I swear I was Big blood brother.. UH..
They tryna knock my steelo, wanna tap my phone cause I kick with amigo
And talk shit and put switches on el caminos
Flood borders like from seawater from el nino
And to fly above the bullshit I probably would
But G5 jets never land in the hood
And hoes bust and bite down, cause you poppin right now
You rappin for the fame I rap like they gone turn my lights out
Shit was fucked up just a week ago
Now I'm Cinematic like a movie you ain't seen before..
And this is just the warm up, niggas ain't seen the flow
I told 'em see me on top
, What the Fuck you blinking fo'
Shootin at they battle ships these fragile niggas sinking slow
Probably made 'em look bad, I'm sorry I ain't e'en know
We ain't e'en equal if the Constitution said so
I'm a Titan fuck subliminals I'm throwing lightening bolts
Gotta want foreva moe, what the fuck you fighting foe
Barbaric with my merit, keep what I kill like them viking folks
I am throwed, pass it like Brett Favre before the Vikings choked
Riding slow, candy paint like lookin in kaleidoscopes
Obstacles? I throw and jump over like I'm mario
Lyrical, exercise a monster with the cardio
Pop bottles after victories, what the fuck you party fo'
Board game bitches, I ain't fuckin with a Sorry! ho
Class was in session years ago, what you tardy foe
Billion dollar mouth piece to auction off my audio...

My Interpretation,UnKnown,UnKnown,"What if all the songs vain
And the dreams that I had never came and I had lost all the blessings I had gained?
Woke up in a world that was built upon pain
With an attitude like you ain't shit without fame
I'm quite gifted, with good hair and light skinned
A white pigment with a budget that's like spending
Infatuated with heaven although I like sinning
Say I'd never claim to be, but I'm quite Christian
To what extent would I go for ice wristes
Chain necklaces and overzealous bitches
Excuse my tone, yes I know the difference in a
Woman for self and a jazze belle
I ain't lost, I'm just speaking the truth
Some things I'd say even if I wasn't speaking to you
Jay said you gotta learn just to live with regrets
But what happens when regrets is all you got left?
Cuz you never got a fair chance
How can you waltz through life when it's a square dance?
And the leaders ain't leading, and the preaches sold out
Sitting in church like, ""who's gonna save my soul now?""
They try to tell me that God ain't real
And a chain of big explosions is why I'm here
And a ape decided he wanted to walk upright
And leave the other apes in the jungle, cuz he that tight...you got me fucked up
I knew that shit could take flight
When my social studies teacher told me Egyptians were white
Not to be funny, might of seemed she was playing
But when I went to correct her, she believed what she saying
Kinda hard to give your all when you ain't inherit no cream
Parents broke now you feeling like the shit in your jeans
And life ain't shit like you see in your dreams
Percieved as a peasant but in your mind you stand as a king
Hating on the next man cuz he was a ruler
And overlooked your whole kingdom cuz he found him a jeweler
Queen with an ass, a couple cars with a dash
That functions with secret compartments for his pistol and cash
Trapped in the flash, you think the world at his feet
Cuz you serve the very plate of steak & shrimp that he eat
It was hard for you then, but it'll be hard in a month
Know the check you work for, we spent that much on lunch
Yea yea, you spend that much on bills
And hit your momma house when you can't buy your meals
Like, ""Lord how we do dirt and live so fly?""
And you in church everyday but you just get by
And all you really ever wanted was a car and a crib
A little extra to buy something nice for your kids
But the life that you live is the only life that you know
Thanking God, with only hope for something better in store...this is my interpretation
And if you got more than a mil in your possession
What the fuck you know about a recession?
This is my interpretation
My interpretation

If I should die from this rap shit
On a plane to a show for the masses

A king lost, shed tears for my passin'
Remember I was happy here that's what I'm askin'
When I was with ya, yeah, you always kept me laughin
Forgive me for the plans we never made
And all the things I wish I could but I never say
I hope God overlook the days I never prayed
And embrace a sudden loss if I'm never saved

I can say I lived life
If I should die

It be far far before my time
I mean far far before my time

Because I've known ya

If I should die
Mind I never wanted to leave
Let the niggas in the hood throw a party for me
Smoke good, drink good, blow something my way
Don't trip, dry your eyes, just keep yo faith
And let the hoes that I used to know from way before
Kiss me from my head to my toes
Give me some paper and pens
So I can write about the world
The child that I never had and my favorite girl
No legacy on my own but I did what I could
Never liked saying goodbyes
But I know that I should
Even though It be far before my time
Just know that I'm fine
If I should die

It be far far before my time
I mean far far before my time
But I won't doubt ya
Because I've known ya

If I should die
Just know that I went out in a blaze
From some hater plotting to kill me
Cause he know that I'm paid
Tell my niggas hold your horses, don't kill pimpin'
I forgive him, you should too, let God deal with him
Anytime you see the purpose of mercy
No weapon formed against me on earth shall hurt me
Yeah heaven's right in front of me, I'm hoping I'm worthy
All I have is faith, Lord I can't be certain
What my future holds
Or where will I go when I exit this vessel
And these brown eyes close
Even though it be far far before my time
I can say I tried
If I should die

It be far far before my time
I mean far far before my time

Back when me and young Pimp C was out there on the grind
When all that we was focused on was money on our minds
We was all up in the studio, putting it down for days
At the time, with them beats and rhymes, and we had on them Js
Pimp said if you wanna be great affiliate with greatness
Best clothes, best shoes, best music on your playlist
So we bought a bunch of Polo and we jammed a bunch of ‘Pac
And we put on fresh Jordan’s when we stepped out on the block
I was lovin’ them 11's ‘cause they came with patent leather
And if you had a candy car that shit just went together
You thinking that I’m playing ‘bout being an 11 lover?
Check the back of Ridin’ Dirty, I wore ‘em on the cover


Out the wrap, freshly packaged, Jordan 12s, copped a taxi
My shoe game be the truth, mane - if it’s dead stock, I’ve got to have it
At Sneaker Pimps and Ice Kicks, I hit the stage with that Jordan braille
A few months before they came out
That’s just how it be, know you understand
And this flight club that we be in – black and varsity red
Couldn’t wait to ball on ‘em, stand tall on ‘em
‘Cause them flu games go Fed
So when I hit the stage life
Yeah, them stage lights put the shine on my kicks
Tuck those laces up when I stage dive, these strains got to stay crispy
I’ve got 12 for all of my fits, and gold all on my wrist
And rings all on my fist, like I was in championships
In this game with E and this game with Play, I stay fly like every day

Shit changed, I Liu Kang, kick it wherever
Bottom feeders, never reach us, ties severed
Bird hoes, come and go I ruffle they feathers
Ever since I flew the coop I been shitting on niggas' stoops
Fast forward Caddy doors, mothafuck a Subaru
Play ball or go home, I'm swinging for the fence
As soon as I could pay my rent, I ain't been the same since
Breakfast Ruth's Chris, lunch at Del Frisco's
Philippe's dinner, green prawns, damn I might get those
I'm popping like Crisco, window came tinted
Now I'm riding something foreign with the woodgrain in it
Word to Dutch, cobra clutch these bucks and never let go
These hoes suck and fuck like what! - cause I said so
Retro, more like deadstock with my wordplay
My life's a vacay er'day
Krizzle


I just wanna ride clean with five screens - digidash
Adjust the mirror, flip the signal - then hit the gas
The road to riches, filled with detours, that’ll block my path
But I'm official, to my bone gristle, just check my tag
That candy paint was a mixture of hues
Don't be confused by the blues
That fade into purples and grains
Just know I'm doing my thang
Since way back, I had that, straight crack
Since I rapped on that 8-deck
And them hood niggas used to play that
Like he got potential
I heard that youngin, he saying something
Don't fall victim to materialism, you know it's coming
Just keep on jumping, above the rim
And anybody that can't be happy that you dunking, don't fuck with them
I listened up, pressed my luck and hit it big
They figured Krizzle would fall off quicker than drawers on a stripper
But never figured this
That I'd remained unstained, still a king remembered in time
They could never block my shine
I'm live and in effect nigga


Night time ?? flow
Locked like white folk car door
When you ride through the bad part of town slow
Jack you for your Acura
That's how the hell I'mma act up
Put fear in they heart like Cassius
Claiborne isn't in fashion
But what they study at NASA mean
Choke you out like Death Row
Flow in turn is a balcony
Beg for life when I touch the mic
Rap and I'm gunning for all emcees
Autumn leave and I change my rap
Flow for days, lap for lap
Secretary of triple crown
Flow, charisma, I'm lyrical
In turn the throne it waits me now
If you wait me now, gotta a big big pound
Like a dapped up Shaq with a triple crown
Triple threat like Michael crown
King and queen no castle now
In the capital, North Raleigh
Feel it deep down in yo body
Can't stop me like  partna
Can't tear apart the grind
Like Northern Stars I shine
Success comes to me and you and those who think it in they minds
So shine
So shine

Hey i can set you out, I know that she ain’t trippin

Although them fellas hit ya
I know you diggin’ me
Cuz when we all alone

And all my fantasies, you help me see them clearly
And i can't concentrate shawty when yee ain’t nowhere near me
They say you’re healthy for me
You got a thousand names
But in them years that i’ve come to know ya, you’re Mary Jane

I never met your brothers, reggie and bobby brown
Heard they can’t stand me so they can't come on this side of town

Verse 2
No matter where I go I know that I could find you
And when I’m on my grind I’m knowin that you grind too
Hey I’m a little selfish, I hate to pass you round
And when I pick you up I find it hard to put you down
I keep ya tucked away, for all them rainy days
Hey girl I dig your aura, it’s like a purple haze
You got me (spaced out), and that’ll never change
Your body light as air, I watch ya float away
Most of my friends come around cuz they wanna taste ya
I don’t know why, but some suit n ties love to hate ya
But I just love to drape ya, into the finest dutchies
And when I’m fallin down, you like a playa crutches
And when I first saw ya, I knew you was a dime
Who would’ve known ?on average? that you would be all mine
I’m just a lucky nigga, i’m really glad I found ya
It’s safe to say that I don’t know what I would do without ya

Rubber bands in my pocket
A couple broads for the poppin'
If she ridin' then she boppin'
Bitch, I'm sellin' if you shoppin'
If you need it then I got it
If I want it then I cop it
If you don't like, nigga, top it
Why you worried 'bout mine, hoe?
What's off in your wallet?
I was ridin' my screw shit
Rims chop choppin'
Top dropping throwin' bread crumbs
Crows start flockin'
Knockin' pictures off the wall
We sit tall, we still crawl
We still shoot, we still score
We still win so we still ball
We still hood so fuck the law
I got nuts and I got loot
If you can't see the king
In a nigga like me undoubtedly
Well, fuck him too
Let me tell you 'bout this
Super fly, dirty, dirty
Third coast muddy water
Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna
Let me tell you 'bout this
Old school, pourin' lean
Candy yams and collard greens
Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit

Okay, the caddy still swangin'
And the trunk still bangin'
Nigga trickin' ain't pimpin', shawty
What is y'all thinkin'?
What, what, what is y'all sayin'?
What, what, what is y'all sangin'?
Hit the club by the bar
Like what is y'all drankin'?
Old school, foreign cars, shawty
What is y'all crankin'?
Kush blunts, bank tellers ask me
Why is y'all stankin'?
If it's money I chill, shawty
Why is y'all playin'?
She was bound to fuck a pimp
So why is you carin'?
Save the hoe
Cape crusader and her service aidin' hoe
Dame the hoe, blame the hoe
For the same shit you pay me fo'
Shake it mo' for a pimp
With my shrimp on my plate
Countryfied, country fly with a tape
Let me tell you 'bout this
Super fly, dirty, dirty
Third coast muddy water

Good Foot,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They think the money might change me
Well maybe so
Cause I'm tired of being fucked up and being poor
Scheming on a dumb nigga for a plate
With these songs like a good perm, hope it take
Niggas ride with their tops down in the hood
Chucking deuces to the bad bitches, Understood
What it took just to be a man, my plan
Pay me what you owe, not what you can't
I was down for mine, that's all I ever knew
While you was talking shit, I was talking revenue
I told em get paid, stay the fuck out of the mix
Cause niggas ain't real
And hoes ain't shit
Good foot, I stay up off mine
And watch your step
Niggas ain't right, that's why they so left
Good foot, now what you waitin on?
I told him get paid, stay the fuck out of the mix
Cause niggas ain't real
And hoes ain't shit
Now, who the fuck told you I ain't heavy as boulders?
I got a thousand years, surely there's nothing colder
There's no one closer to the Biggie flow
Give and go, on these hoes the number one negro
They blow like Piccolo
Benzes and Beemers
I shine like the sun at the peak of a zenith
Who am I bitch? What you know about the hard knock
Old school time machine
From the light to hard top
No tears, see my face, ho?
I've been passed you, what you pumping your brakes for?
Chill! And stay the fuck out of the mix
Cause niggas ain't real
And hoes ain't shit",https://genius.com/Big-krit-good-foot-lyrics
Hey You,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Aye, let me holla for a second
Shoot some game in your direction
'bout this pimp shit, you was tailor-made
For this outfit
Mind molded, brave ho, blindfolded
Hands tied, never fall, landsliding
I'm your man now, your one and only
Your best friend, your homie
Confidant when you lonely
Tell me all your dreams
And I'll proceed to sew the seams of this love affair
A blanket with my arms to keep you warm
Stay up under here
Picture us rollin'
, car not stolen
Gator shoes on my feet, chinchilla on my shoulders
Coasting down 85 as you drive
I puff this loud, put it in the air, sky-high
A certified gold mine between your thighs
I polish it and set it out to let it shine
We going places like we never been
Our side of town is smaller than the smallest town we in
These lenses see your flaws
Down for your cause
When you let down your guard and I broke down your walls
My number one starter
Proud of you, no doubt in you, nothing like your father
I drafted you then coached you in when no one else would bother

Hey you (Hey you)
Baby, baby (Get down with this team shawty)
I wanna talk to you (Let me talk to you)
Baby, baby (Put you in this game, be my starter)
Hey you
Baby, baby (Let me be your Bulls)
I wanna talk to you (Get you a couple rings, babygirl)
Baby, baby (We goin places '09, ya feel me?)

A'ight, ok, a'ight, pretty brown eyes
You can't deny I got you twisted like a dread
On Erykah Badu's head that went missing
You gifted and I know it
Down to help you show it
Pimpin' is as fluid as water, let me pour it
On your mind
Drip into your veins, feel it tingle in your spine
Pump into your heart
Lose control, let it ride
Give it all you got
Any doubts, let 'em die
It's just you and I, sho' you right
Everything is everything, chillin' in the breeze
Why give it up for love when you can charge a trick a fee?
Don't know how you should budget?
Baby, bring that shit to me
I'll knock it up and stretch it as far as the eye could see
So forward flow
Colder than cold could wish to be
?... smell of P-I-M-P
Sippin' saki with Chinese broads that dig my spit
Holla ""Wo Ai Ni K.R.I.T"" when they jump on my tip

In The Rain,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'd like to a, sometimes
Excuse me for being so blunt
It's in my nature, you know

Sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like a hurricane went and formed on me
I swear the teardrops of God feel so warm on me
Well drown me in no more sorrows, hopeless tomorrows
Should have died so long ago I swear my time is borrowed
But give me no shelter, no cheap umbrellas
You'd learn to cherish rain if you came to the desert
A little comfort in the heat of the devil
Rain drop freeze and form ice on my vessel
Frostbit fingertips, frozen cut necklace
No Doppler system or weather man projected this
The storm of the century, monsoon on this industry
Puddles reflect the truth I surely was meant to be
Flash floods in ass clubs, no life jackets for these rappers
On the roof of success but watch 'em pass us
Look for answers in the sky can't trust my pastor
He say whatever in the name to get my cash cause
He hurting just like me, working just like me, uncertain just like me

Yeah I don't like to go out in the rain

Big Brother,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Krizzle he a new breed
Life is like a movie
All the new comers like who he? who me?
Just a nigga straight up out the gutta
With the skill that make a new yorker wanna be southern
Streets lights tell the stories of the real niggas
Pardon me if half of the time I never feel niggas
Like honestly how the fuck you get a deal nigga?
I guess once I get on I'm gonna have to kill niggas
Lord I was trying not to push it to the ledge
The grind ain't sturdy and we hanging on the edge
Mississippi got next
You heard what I said?
And I'll still out rap some of the best when I'm dead
Check my cred killer is a vet
I'm talking about bars I ain't talking about pets
When I get green like gumby I stretch
A pair of J's out the case
I'm that fresh, yes
Give me any beat
And I'll kill it like it's living
I only do me it's fuck how they feeling
That green that I'm toting got me higher than the ceiling
The whip color sunny d nigga I'm orange peeling
Street life chilling niggas can't touch me
Car without an engine, bitch you can't budge me
Heard the lames hate me and they baby mommas love me
If they didn't handcuff em at my show
They'd probably fuck me
I'm a little crazy
I'm a little off though
Put you on display in the day like a car show
Toss you in the trunk
And drive away with the cargo
All I see is snow bunnies
Call me Donnie Darko
Grill look mean on the whip
It's a gargoyle
This the shit niggas in the hood
Sell hard for
A fine crib and a lambo marcielago
A1 credit and the next top model
But you know niggas
Think they guns can stop 4 niggas
Claim they hard as hell
But really ho niggas
Slow niggas never get paid
Gold diggers get played
And lame niggas never get laid
Unless they throwing fetti
At a chick they call me daddy
She bring me all the money
Because she know that make me happy
Go out and break her back
Just to keep a nigga flashing
And see me on top
She thought it was a classic
I'm a nervous wreck
On the mic
I keep spazzing
Married to my money
And she having contractions
Gave birth to money
With no lamaze classes
My toddler dig the new line
Of rubberband fashion",https://genius.com/Big-krit-big-brother-lyrics
Stand Behind Mine,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death

Your chariot awaits, now that your on time you'll never be as safe when you was late
Some extend love, but most will show hate
To a dreamer of freedom that chose his own fate
I never lost face in the eye of the Lord
Did what I could with a shield and a sword
A mic with no cord, hammer like Thor
Screamed from my gut they can't fight us no more
A world at war, rich against poor
Look to the sky util my eyes get sore
Be fearful of things just could be in store
When the guns are drawn and the trumpets roar

I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death

Everything that you put in, the things that you did that you swore on a stack of Bibles, you wouldn't
But you've tooken so much bull shit when it was time to take it all down, you couldn't
The glamour of the world got you all these girls
Your lies and your flow bring you all that dough
Your ice on your neck is nowhere near that cold
To chill the heat of hell when its on your soul
Its even harder dear Father, to be David
When Goaliths so much larger
Then the stone that we gonna
But I'll fight like its no tomorrow, because

I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death

Okay, a rich man's pride is a poor man's pain
Keep what you kill its an unfair game
Some see success end the all stress
A car with you crib is all you get at best
A closet fulla fresh, according to the streets
But its all bull shit, between you and me
Friends turn foes because they want your life
Cuz ya 7:45 in a G5 flight
But how could ya blame em?
You promised you wouldn't leave them
In the same place ya came from
They like money must of changed him
You like money must of changed them
Re-arranged them
But

Hustlers Ambition,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I got a thing for this rap shit
Get money mad shit
Look at how they maxed me
Whats happening
On some super hero shit
In the city of villains
Well for a fee between you and me, niggas is killing
NARC's dirty like roaches usually they sellin'
Never had a heart growing up usually he tellin'
Saw that nigga never spoke to him, for a good reason
In class poppin' off, used to say I was cheatin'
I keep my business on the low, convos to the minimum
You ain't ever heard of money bags, while I'm in to them
Make moves and break rules, fuck bendin' em
Might haul off and swing on a nigga like a pendulum
Stick to the code little man that's what they told me
O.G.'s that did they time like fuck the police
Never trust a soul when you get this dough
Seen best friends turn to foes and jump ship like hoes
I see it clearly now, I'm on my grizzly now
Might have to maul me a nigga with the semi now
Sniper shit 50 cal yea, get away clean boss
Concentrate calculate and knock ya head clean off
I don't need you to love me nigga
Probably mad cuz your bitch want to fuck me nigga
At my show, front row trynna touch me nigga
Down to fuck she gave it up you be her hubby nigga
I'm on some pimp shit, no can't limp shit
Tell her, her pet name, bring me that bread ""bitch""
No I tease on the track, watch how I sketch this
A master piece so accurately a hustler's profession
No half way all in, nigga I'm ballin'
Jim Jones hoes with a lambo I crawl in
Maybach that's right more ice than a half pipe
I must of been King tucked somewhere in my past life
Hold up, roll up, that good take a slow puff

The Truth Freestyle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Chyuh, 3rd coast, Ya
Multi-records.net, chyuh
Multi alumni, okay
Chyuh, aye, aye, aye okay

Play it all cautious, still a little nauseous
Burnt in or broke I gotta get this shit off me
Rather not talk about it, like who cares?
I'm just a narrator of the song, it's you there
Close your eyes and imagine, lifestyle flashing
Without the headaches stash boxes and a mansion
Something like heaven I guess we all could say
Any time could be your last, I guess we all should pray
Love ain't easy I guess we all should hate
On the next man when the best man won the race
Like he ain't work as hard as you to get by
Congratulate and accept the fact it's his time
But we poor though, I understand your pain
It ain't about win or lose but how you play this game
Somethings I wish I never ever did
Sacrifice a lot just to be on this field
A little more blood shed than there was tears
Might of cried once or twice but that was in between the years
Probably in the bathroom looking in the mirror
Trying to see what my Grandma see in me I can't figure
Money, hoes, and drugs she don't know what I'm doin'
I ain't came up for shit but tell her I'm movin'
I ain't did a song in months but tell her I'm booming
To keep from breaking her heart and causing confusion
Leave it all here she gon' listen to my music
My father know what's up he just acting all clueless
Truth is, she oblivious to the fact
When I tell her I'll be home soon I'm never coming back
Unless I'm in a drop top coupe or a casket
Cuz I'm tired of borrowing but more tired of asking
Crashing, hundred miles per hour head on
Either write about the life you live or dead wrong
Politic with God like ""I ain't doing so well""
Scared the good I done don't exempt me from Hell
Seen so many fell, victim to the streets
How could I care when I was like better them than me?
But that's just how you feel when the struggle is so real
You ain't ate your own meal your homeboy got killed
And he was still a child, damn its hard to smile

Wake up, nothing to do but get my cake up
Praying to my Savior hoping he ain't out favors
Grandma praying for the end Lord come and take us
Head buried so deep in the word that she don't pick her face up
I'm feeling just the same, the heat of hell on my soul
Wondering will it rain?
Prepared to do some dirt but never what they do for fame
Forever paralyzed cuz I've dealt with so much pain shit'll drive a man insane
A little off my rocker
I told my girl I felt like dying it didn't shock her
More like she related
That's why my song take care of momma was such her favorite
She had to leave the room once I played it
The weed and the pills and the drink medicate it
But Willie Hutch start singing, she can't take it
Her pain runs deep too deep for me to chase it
So I let her vent my anger on me cuz I can take it
Cry now smile later cuz this ain't forever
She finds comfort in my confidence but I know better
The devil is all around me in the form
Of ski mask pots and pans Glocks and mason jar
I'm scarred, never would've known it would be this hard
To be a righteous man, in the city of God
In awe, of all the lack of remorse for your brother man
Because you riding in a Porsche and I could understand
If you tried once before to lend a helping hand
And he rejected it with force but if he reaching out
And you deny him of a torch that was passed to you
How could he ever run his course?
And I was feeling like I might rob me a nigga
Cuz even hero's sometimes relate to the villains
Ain't nothing worse than being fed up with your living
Too broke to pay for your own fucking existence
Yeah the truth

Cut her slack, let her go, cause she was in the V-I
Ain't like I be askin fo' attention when I be out

It's straight I would neva go back, I could neva go back, but it would be cool to see
Some time, get up off my ass and mash for cash
No time to becrasting  me
Yeah, I'd rather drink a... but they have to wait

The block used to be sunny but they snowed it in

That's what he said, but the rock is what he really into
Gave him a dollar anyway, cause who knows
Maybe the dope boy baby needs some new clothes
Could we all go and through it, no matter how you view it
Slice it, cut it, bring it back or screw it
Hot as ever been but I'm cooling it ah

To pay the busing responsibilities that I diss on
Now the part the pissing ain't the tree to piss on, the devil come around too much
I'm hardly get going
But it's hard to get off when you can't get on
I brought my life on this... nobody listens songs
So I cruise, me and just my blues
Looking at the world through my broken rear view
Not worry, cause I pray for better days, reminiscence good... how I used to run in places sometimes

They got him praying for his bail so they won't take his kids
Cause his baby momma act out, she'd done backed out
Sold everything in the house cause she cracked out
He turned to me so much pain in his eyes
Like he ain't know being black and po came with a price
He took a toot as if it eased his mind
His nose running heavy cause he geeking lines
Clientele pulled up in a beamer truck served the driver and he said to me
""they got us all fucked up""

When a stone don't settle
I can't hurt forever
How can I do better now?
They got us all fucked up
Break my back for nothing (for nothing)
Lock me up for struggling
Only god can judge me, now
They got us all fucked up

I need a nasty freak to shake that ass for me

I got a friend if you want her, wait I could phone her
Everything have price cause christmas around the corner
Since the recession its been hard if you strippin'
Cause niggas pay to get in but niggas ain't tippin'
Short on rent landlord trippin
Tired of eating noodles that taste like chicken
Don't really like hoin ain't hard to tell
But when all else fail pussy always sell
Song stop spinnin' and the time was up
Snatch the money off the floor and said
""they got us all fucked up""


I had a partner called pimpin
Had hella women say he raw dog chicks and never ever went to clinic
Now he thinks something wrong and he scared to check
He got a girl that he claimed never cared for sex
So he slept on her, crept on her, sometimes he even
Pushed to dying and he stepped on her
One of his cousins buddy called him in and it got him freaked
Say she had a checkup and she got HIv
Claim is all his fault screamin raised her hands
Cause she got two kids and what about her man
He thought about his girl hopped out his truck
Called her phone and said as low as he could

You dip it then you cook yo jaw now you sprung
I have you trippin' like it's nothing thorough
Played on my hoes, don't talk to nobody, gon tell yo girl
(Uh, now look)
Okay but niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip
Cus they pussy wasn't hittin and they lip was super sloppy
Sucka duck a motherf*cker, we done chop the brain about it
But my money corner pocket, plenty game ho
Slap it like a biscuit, king of diamond, king of trickin', what's the difference
Got it poppin' like a skillet with some chicken grease in it
Country born, country paid, from the village to the grave
Worth the payment, body truckin' cus the money I already made
Man I hate that all the time I got haters in my bizz
Talking bout the trill but don't know what the f*ck it is
Mothaf*ckas nowadays are seriously sorry
Thinking that the key to life is putting yo business on Mari
They say you're rockin Mari but them mothaf*ckas Rockport
Always talking bout you bustin nigga but your Glock short
I know the truth so ain't no need in yo line
Bullshit ain't workin, ain't no need to be tryin
I'm dyin to be that nigga that's spyin in the telescope
Prowlin with triller niggas but iron to yo dearly folk
Telling them talk tales, vibs and hung angers
Save it for Jeremy, Kyle, Steven, Jerry Springer
Buzzin like a bee, tryna sting me wit yo stinger
Bitch you could get the middle, (what middle?), the finger
Stick it in yo ass and let it linger
No homo, we give the hynel like the RnB singer Obomo",https://genius.com/Big-krit-gossipzilla-lyrics
Talk To Em,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Settle down K.R.I.T, Settle Down
Talk that shit now)

Pull up clean though. Pocketing up c-notes
Rich and regal. Foreign my ego; Man with akiko
Out the window, whip on limbo/ Sit at the tip top of that mountain
So many haters that watch my pockets, I stop counting
Deep sea blue but I might drown you
Soon as I crowned, then they crowned me
I got love for all my day-oner's but fuck you if you doubted
On some real shit. Pull that on the dollar dollar bill shit
Who would've knew that a crease and 3 piece is something I could kill with
Sharp; Debonair. Playa caught a way to drink until tomorrow
Multi! Do the dash,fuck the light. Do the throttle
You would think I hit the lotto like a rim in a pothole
Made something out of nothing. I'm a fucking role model. (Let me talk to them)
[Chorus 2x)
Settle down K.R.I.T , Settle Down
(Let me talk to them)
Settle down K.R.I.T , Settle Down
(Let me talk to them)
Settle down K.R.I.T , Settle Down
 (Let me talk to them)

This ain't for bloggers, that's for starters. You can review all you want
But it ain't gone stop this shit from beating out the mutha fuckin trunk
They ain't gone stop me reign (rain) like when Noah had to go build the ark
I can whip a track while I'm blindfolded with my hands tied, sitting in the dark
The difference between me and them. I got it out the mud, them niggas skimmed off the top
""You ain't have a vouch?!, Bitch nigga stop!""
Talking catalogs? I done did alot
You was just a pup. I was off the chain. Broke and scratching my way to the block
Dodging the fake love and the pound. Swear it ain't a fence or gate I didn't hop
Trying to catch a break. It's funny how being hungry motivate you
Now I'm like David Blane on a Magic City Monday; Make them levitate
Talking bout low-low's on a old school if I ever got to scrape
This that keep what you kill, eat what you kill. Hope you got a plate (Let me talk to them)


Oh oh oh oh ohhh. Talk that shit now
Let me talk to them
Settle down K.R.I.T, Settle down",https://genius.com/Big-krit-talk-to-em-lyrics

Lfu300ma - intro - album version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Do not be alarmed. You have activated a pre-recording. This is LFU300MA. To hear clearly, adjust volume to maximum velocity. Thank you and enjoy

Back one more 'gain for all them players
Natural women and mindframe elevators
Ten toes down with this experimental south sound
Dope up the lines enough to go around and around and around this world thrice over
Ain't nothing new under the sun back in '05, I tried to told ya
We here 4Eva in a day, can't go back with this one way
Take you to where the grass is much greener
Putting in work for my redeemer
Yea that's the most high
I ain't talking 'bout blunts rolled
But like saved souls and warm welcomes at front doors
Don't let your problems weigh you down
Don't let them burdens slow yo pace
The quickest way from A to Z is straight
On that narrow path, a road less traveled
So free yo mind and be one with time 'cause that's all that matters
Not all that riff raff or random chit chatter
Haters scatters like jacks do
Don't drop the ball unless you can pick up all the weight that a winner has to
Don't let the struggle outlast you
Even if society outcasts you
Stand strong in your belief
The mountain top ain't hard to see
When you let God and let be
Live From the Underground",https://genius.com/Big-krit-lfu300ma-intro-album-version-lyrics
