La Di Da Di,Rapmasters 7: The Best of the Laughs ,1985.0,"OK, party people in the house
You're about to witness something you've never witnessed before
Yes it's the original human beat box, Doug E Fresh
And his partner, the grand wizard, MC Ricky D
D and that's me in the place to be
And we gonna show you how we do it for '85, kick it live, alright
Because, um, I've got a funny feeling, um
You're all sick of all these crap rappers
Biting their rhymes because um they're back-stabbers
But, uh, when it comes to me and my friend Doug Fresh here
There is no competition 'cause we are the best, yeah
Finesse impress which we prove
And y'all will realize that we are the move
So listen close so you all don't miss
As we go a little something like this
Hit it
Ah yeah
Uh, uh, you know what
La-di-da-di
La-di-da-di
La-di
La-di
You know what, yo peep this
La-di-da-di, we like to party
We don't cause trouble, we don't bother nobody, we're
Just some men that's on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic (Right)
For all of y'all keeping y'all in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
'Cause it's cool when you 'cause a cozy condition
That we create, 'cause that's our mission
So listen to what we say
Because this type of shit, it happens every day
I woke up around ten o'clock in the morning
I gave myself a stretch up, a morning yawning
Went to the bathroom to wash up
Had some soap on my face and my hand upon a cup
I said, ""Um, mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top choice of them all?""
There was a rumble jumble, five minutes it lasted
The mirror said, ""You are, you conceited bastard!""
But that's true, that's why we never have no beef
So then I washed off the soap and brushed the gold teeth
Used Oil Of Olay 'cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the files for my fingernails
Due to the night and on my behalf
I put the bubbles in the tub so I could have a bubble bath
Clean, dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new Gucci underwear
For all the girls I might take home
I got the Johnson's Baby Powder and the Polo cologne
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on the Bally shoes and the fly green socks
Stepped out my house stopped short, oh no
I went back in, I forgot my Kangol
And then I dilly (dally), I ran though a (alley)
I bumped into my old girl (Sally) from the (valley)
This is a girl plays hard to get so I said
""What's wrong?"" 'cause she looked upset, she said
""It's all because of you I'm feeling sad and blue
You went away and now my life is filled with rainy days
And I love you so, how much you'll never know
'Cause you took your love away from me""
Now what was I to do
She's crying over me and she was feeling blue
I said, um, ""Don't cry, dry your eye
Here comes your mother with those two little guys""
Her mean mother stepped up, said to me ""hi""
Looked Sally in the face and decked her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong, the kids was gone
Something was wrong, I said ""What is going on?""
I tried to break it up, I said ""Stop it, leave her""
She said ""If I can't have you, she can't either""
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out like I had the chicken pox, but
She gave chase, she caught up quick
She put a finger in the face of MC Rick
She said, ""Why don't you give me a play
So we can go cruising in my OJ?
And if you give me that OK
I'll give you all my love today
Ricky, Ricky, Ricky, can't you see?
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Oh, MC Rick, my love is here to stay!""
And on and on and on she kept on
The bitch been around before my mother's born
I said, ""Cheer up,"" I gave her a kiss
I said, ""You can't have me, I'm too young for you miss.""
She says, ""No, you're not!"" then she starts crying
I says, ""I'm nineteen,"" she said, ""Stop lying!""
I says, ""I am, go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy, I can't be your lover!""
To the tick tock ya don't stop
To the tick tick ya don't quit
Hit it!

The Show,"Oh, My God!",1986,"Ladies and gentlemen
The most exciting stage show you've ever witnessed
Appearing live, Doug E Fresh and the Get Fresh Crew
(Oh my God!)

Excuse me Doug E Fresh
Yes?
Have you ever seen a show with fellas on the mic
With one minute rhymes that don't come out right
They bite, they never write, that's not polite
Am I lying?
No, you're quite right
Well tonight on this very mic you're about to hear
We swear, the best darn rappers of the year
So, so, cheerio, yell, scream bravo
Also, if you didn't know this is called The Show

A-yo Doug
What?
Put your Ballys on
Yo Rick, I was about to but I need a shoe horn
Why?
Because these shoes always hurt my corns
Six minutes...
Six minutes...
Six minutes Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on, uh uh on, uh-huh-uh-huh-uh uh uh on
Uh uh on
(Is it real?)

Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Here we go (here we go) come on (come on)
Yo, where's Will and Barr?
Well I don't know they're late
Told 'em the time, oh I forgot the date
Man, you did it again, oh no
Yo, here we go, come on, here we go, come on
Here we go, did you miss the show
No, no, no-no-no no we didn't
No no-no-no no-no-no no we didn't
No we didn't, well don't get us wrong
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E...
Excuse me Doug E Fresh you're on
Uh uh on

Well it started off on 8th Avenue
When I made up the name called the Get Fresh Crew
It was me, my two DJs Chill Will and Barry B
And my right hand man Ricky D
I used to rap and sing, make sounds and things
And for example, here's a telephone ring
*Ring, ring* Hello, is Doug E Fresh in?
No, he's not in right now *click*
But anyway, no more delay
Just check out the new style I display
Now you got to be (fresh)
To rock with (fresh)
And I'm D-O-U-G-I-E (fresh)
And I'm known for the... *Doug E Fresh beatbox*
Not for the... *Fat Boys beatbox*
The human beat box or the entertainer
No other title can fit me plainer
In a passing generation, I am a remainer
And I'm also known as the beatbox trainer
Cashing checks, make sound effects
And after I finish rocking, Slick Rick is on next
(You know it) Slick Rick!

Well, here's a little something that needs to be heard
Doug, I was going downtown (word, Rick?) Word!
(Sure) all alone, no one to be with
Stepped on the D-Train at 205th
I saw a pretty girl (so?) so I sat beside her
Then she went roar like she was Tony the Tiger
I said hold on, there's been a mistake
Honey, my name's Slick Rick not Frostie Flakes
(Oh, golly wolly) Cause she was raising hell
She said, um, my name is Maggie but call me Michelle
Michelle, my belle
Sont des mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
Slick Rick and 'em rock the house you know I'm saying
And when I'm on the mic there won't be no delaying
Bust a move, we show and prove
A-yo Doug, do that record Jam On The Groove

As you can see, most definitely, we are (fresh)
Chill Will (fresh)
Barry B (fresh)
Ricky D (fresh)
And I am the original human beat box, the entertainer, Doug E (fresh)",https://genius.com/Doug-e-fresh-and-the-get-fresh-crew-the-show-lyrics
Keep Risin’ to the Top,The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988.0,"(Verse one)
I wanted this to special, something more
Than any other feeling that you felt before
Pushin through the doors I see girls
Havin' a good time, I might say a rhyme
Old school, new school, no school rule
But other than that, everything is cool
I see guys and girls dancin', doin' the new dances
That's a hit,while I'm over here romancin'
You ain't shh.....no need to curse
Ask me who she is and let me tell you first
Slow down, be cool and don't act ill
I came to have a good time, party and chill with you
Don't worry sweetheart I'm still with you
And after we leave we will continue
With our plans
But plans are made to be broken
Smokin', I'm not jokin'
Try to Dis'me and I'll give you a token
Cause I'm the type of brother that can't be stopped
And no matter what I'm gonna
Keep risin' to the top (Sampler intro)
While my mind say
( CHORUS)
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got
Ain't no half steppin'
Give it all you got, give it all you got
Cause we're the Get Fresh Crew, yeah, yeah......
(Verse two)
Now the music is pumpin', good atmosphere
Chill Will and Barry Bee, they must a beat me here
There in the booth
Which is all sound proof
Playn' ""dope"" jams to rock the youth
But the MC on the mic shouted out
We got the Get Fresh Crew stars in the house
And as the crowd started breakin', I didn't reply
Cause the only stars I know are in the sky
So we continued,to the venue
Didn't pretend to be nuthin' but Doug E
As a brother extended out his hand to me
And asked me would I rock the microphone
I just gave him a pound and said Shalom
Sharp as a harp played by a musician
My body tone, is like throne
Wearin Calvin Klein Obssession Cologne
Etc., etc., in a cashmere sweater
I'm in a cherokee, Chill Will in a Audi
And Barry Bee, is ridin' with me
Because we're the type of brothers that can't be stopped
And no matter what we're gonna
Keep risin' to the top (Sampler intro)
While my mind say
( Chorus)
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got
Ain't no half steppin'
Give it all you got, give it all you got
Keep risin' to the top
Now let the beat drop",https://genius.com/Doug-e-fresh-and-the-get-fresh-crew-keep-risin-to-the-top-lyrics
All the Way to Heaven,"Oh, My God!",1986.0,"Rap, these are the prime years
And we are the members of The Get Fresh Crew
On a lifetime mission to explore new beats and new cuts
To take rap, beyond the point, that no other rapper has ever thought about before
You know why? (Why!)
Ask me why? (Why!)
We on a mission!

All the way to heaven!
All the way to heaven!
All the way to heaven!
All the way to heaven!

N-n-n-now my name is Doug E. Fresh and I love to perform
And, you know I got to have my Ballys on
But a new corporation around the block
Did not want (thing!) they did not want 
They did not want The Get Fresh Crew to rock
Because-a once we're together we can't be stopped
And the talent to rock it is what we've got
And people want us to break up, but we cannot
People want us to break up, but we cannot
To the tippy-tippy top 
What up! (What up!) What up! We on a mission!

All the way to heaven!
All the way to heaven!
All the way to heaven!
All the way to heaven!

Now this will be the first time in history
A rap song is dedicated to G-O-D
And it's highly advanced, to make you dance
And if you're doing what I'm doing
 it's about to 
Achoo! (God bless you!) God bless you too!
Now tell me who wanna rock with The Get Fresh Crew?
(Me too!) Cool!
When I ask this question people came to the mall
As if we had applications for some of 
(Excuse me Doug E. Fresh, someone to see you named Bob)
Bob? (Yes Bob!) He drive that all-white Saab?
(Well) Tell him to him wait, I'm havin' lunch, I'm eatin' corn on the cob!
Now wait! Hold up! Stop! Mamma said  let the beatbox break!
(beatboxing)
Uhh, excuse me, what is your name again?

The entertainer Doug E. Fresh is my claim to fame
But not too many people know the meaning of the name
Before I go, we're gonna let you see
My name and per-son-al-i-ty
D! ""D"" for dedication
O! ""O"" is for our
U! The ""U"" is for unique and the
G! ""G"" is for God
The ""E"" is ever so, and by now you guessed
That you can't spell Doug E. without the (Fresh!)
Human beatbox, rhym-ing specialist
Goin' for more and never settle for less
In the morning I brush my teeth with Crest
Until the cleaners, they get my Fila pressed
Because that's the way I dress (What!) Yes!
Ain't nothin' to it, but to do it
(Why's it gotta be you Doug!)
Somebody gotta do it
On and on until the breaks of dawn
And you know Get Fresh won't steer you wrong
You keep on until the breaks of day
(And-a) To try to understand what we say, okay
Now through strengths and struggles, I made a vow
I put my hand on the bible and I said ""Thou""
Shall always rock the microphone
With partners, friends and if so alone
And preach and preach and through music I'll teach
Any group, company, posse or each
Person, personnel, and personally
As a gift from God that's sent through me
'Cause I'm just like Moses, no one knows this
The way I dress and my lifestyle shows this
To be true God made things in two
With Chill Will and Barry Bee are The Get Fresh Crew
Say what, say what, say what
Say what, say what, say what
Say what, say what, say what
Say what, say what, say what
Say what, say what, say what

Play This Only at Night,"Oh, My God!",1986.0,"If you had something that my words of urge
Thoughts in my mind translated into proverbs
Curve your adolescence relax your might and listen
To this real beat but never alone at night
This could never be fiction or proper diction and I would
Never want to cause confliction between yourself and no one
Else besides hearing the truth is good for your health
And I don’t know that you don’t know but imma
Tell you like this we all gotta go when I know nobody gotta go
Like that yall, so you better rise
And play this only at night
So you better rise, and play this only at night
When I hear this my sides get tight I grid down on my teeth
With all my might, play this only at night
And I don’t know that you don’t know but I'mma tell
You like this we all gotta go but I know nobody gotta go like that yall
Koons be cooching up against the wall and I can hear it all day cause I gotta
Small hallway
A real bad habit is hard to break and people can’t
Admit when they make a mistake
So many years ideas from us been stolen
To talk is silver solid golden
And I don’t know if you don’t know but I'mma tell you like
This we all gotta go but I know nobdy gotta go like that yall
You better rise
Land is image water is the reflection keep your
Mind pointed in the right direction don’t reach for
Nothing less under perfection. I sharp eye and man sharp man
And all good things must come to and end
When I hear this my sides get tight
I grind down on my teeth with all my might
Play this only at night
I don’t know if you don’t know but I'mma tell you like that
We all gotta go and I know nobody gotta
Go like that yall
So you better
Ancient old, worth more than gold
Cannot be bought, cannot be sold
Cannot be pushed, cannot be lifted
And I'm tellin' U, U gotta whole lot 2 deal with
In this world of all diverse
Like U used 2 talk proper but now U curse
The sun used 2 shine from day 2 day
Now the whole universe is filled with gray
No friends, children, family nor wife
And disrespect is the way of life
U wanna go, say no, don't need no airfare
Just open your eyes and then U're there
And if U go, come right and exact
And remember, there's no way back
So close your eyes live 'n hate and despise
All those girls and all those guys
Who told you, you never had stars in your eyes

Cut That Zero,The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"Come on baby why you cryin'?He hit you?
Who done it?Your boyfriend?
That chicken McNugget?
That Box Head kd that don't know how to act?
Instead os that Chicken McNugget,you know what you need?
You know what you need baby?
You need a value pack.....
So won't you cut that zero
Get with this hero
Just say yes I don't want to hear no no's
Cause that's not the way it goes
And I'll take you to every Get Fresh show
I'll greet you like are supposed to be greeted
Treat you like you supposed to be treated
Hold you tight when I know that you need it
And I would never act conceited
Even if I drove a brand new car
And ate high priced food like caviar
I would stay the same and never change my name
Or put you through those love sick games
Because a woman like you is hard to find
Not just in the body also in the mind
We fit together like pants and a pocket
When we make love its like a plug in a socket
Pushing more power than a thousand volts
And if you fall in love it ain't my falt so baby....
(chorus)(x2)
Cut that zero
And get with this hero
Just say yes I don't want to hear no no's
Cause that's not the way it goes
And I'll take you to every Get Fresh show
Ho,ho,ho baby,baby
Well I like me a girl that makes me laugh
And wash my back when I'm taking a bath
And massage my shoulders when thay hurt
And at night go to sleep in my tee shirt
And have our pictures hangun' on the walls
And a room full of ""I love you"" dolls
And be there when I get that feelin for some
""Sexual healin""
(chorus)(x2)
Now when I'm with a girl I'm very direct
And she knows of hand that I need respect
And I could tell by her eyes when she needs love
That's when I put up E.Fresh and just be Doug
And treat you gentle,physical and mental
No love we share will be experimental
Your lips on me
My arms around you
Ain't nothing in the world that we can't do
Now a movie is groovie,a date is great
But a real good time only lasts past eight
And it's fun when I'm chillin' with you
And I could never throw away what we've been through
And what I think I'm really tryin' to say is
What I think I'm really tryin' to say is
What I think I'm really tryin' to say is
I'm with you all the way

Abortion,"Oh, My God!",1986.0,"(Hook)
Abortion! Abortion, Abortion
The name of this record is called...Abortion
Mind distortion, the world morals is out of proportion
And I want it played in every Walkman
Abortion! Abortion!
(Stop, stop, stop)
(Verse 1)
Girl, you must be crazy to kill a newborn baby
Sittin' on your ass all day, so lazy
Say to yourself, ""Look what this man done gave me""
Yellin' for help, but sayin' ""Preacher, preacher, save me""
All of us were born into a life of sin
That's something in the genes buried deep within
But to give or take life, you must pay the price
So that brothers and sisters, it's not that nice
You were born into sin, so don't sin twice
Doug E. Fresh would never give the wrong advice
About...
(Hook)
(Excuse me Doug E. why you sound so different?)
You know what?
My voice sounds different 'cause it makes me mad
To see a mother not a mother or a dad not a dad
And one more thing that I would like to add
For the kids being killed, it's so, so sad
I'm talkin' about abortion!
The prettiest thing besides your wife
Is having the privilege to make new life
How can you kill your only daughter or son?
If God wanted you to lose it, it would've been done
(Hook)
Now, I don't weigh it, just say it and convey it
Put it on record with no delayin' it
And playin' hits to hearts of all
Before the whole population starts to fall
There's not too many things that I'm sure of
But one thing I know that the Devil loves
Is abortion
I'm talkin' about abortion!
Here we go!

The Plane (So High),The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"So high,so high(on the plane) (x16)
Walkin' on the plane I see so many faces
Some from out of town and distant places
There could never be a question of who knows who
And no tellin' what most of them have been through
True you can't judge a book by its cover
And if I'm in love does that make me a lover
And if you see a wrinkle does it mean I'm old
And am I wrong for saying what I want in a song
Questions like these my mind it teases
Or I could act like a soldier and just at ease
And don't think about it
And don't worry about it
And keep my head up high and don't ask why
And think about the graduation at Hawai Kai
When we felt good about what we did
And didn't do the thought about me and you
I left it up to you
All up to you
But you felt that your heart would melt
And got scared and fastened up your seat belt
Because the plane was going so high in the sky
And I didn't  know that you were scared to fly
But you told me
By showin me in a way I can't say cause it's hard to describe
And left me feeling the funniest vibes
Of unsureness
Amid insecure confusion
Too good to be true a dramatic illusion
As you sit in seat A and I sit in seat B
I want the whole world to see what you mean to me
If love was able to speak mine would talk so loud
Me and you all alonemaking love on a cloud
An uncontrollable urge
That's why I'm on the verge
Wondering of actions speak louder than words(sounds of gunfire)
And as we become one we feel no pain
Our bodies so wet that we make rain
It's like a mystery for the world to see
But only me and you knew our destiny
You might think I'm crazy or just too deep
Or too far or too gone or too wide or too steep
Whatever you may feel about me inside
Sit back,relax and enjoy the ride
On the plane
So high,so high(on the plane) (x10)",https://genius.com/Doug-e-fresh-and-the-get-fresh-crew-the-plane-so-high-lyrics
Guess Who?,The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"Ayy!!Rhymin' is a skill that I perfected
And all around the world I'm nuch respected
For all the ""dope"" beats that's been selected
You tape them on your tape and then eject it
From your box and run down the block
Now the whole neighborhood's in a state os shock
Feel electricity you wonder who's he?
The rhymes seems to change and it varys
In different forms and different sizes
It paralyzes and energizes
And it surprises me I thought you knew
You don't know who it is Guess?Who?
I take time and patience,public relations
Stand and scan the demand in the nation
With expertise and a new release
Make another well known rapper seem deceased
And keep him under
Make him wonder
Nine to five and if he don't survive
That's just another brother that's been buried alive
'Cause time is money
Money is time
And I got just enough time to say my rhymes
And connect each phrase,keep a crowd in amazement
I wear a suit to important engagements
Turn the whole house out,rock the old and the young
Record at Daily Planet and mix a Chung...King
And any song taht you heard me sing
It don't mean a thing if it ain't got swing
And it surprises me,I thought you knew
You don't know who it is?....GUESS?WHO?
(Cuts)Doug E. (repeat)
Movin' and groovin' to music that's smoothin'
It's been proven by us
Biters rust,girlies lust,rappers are crazy fussed
Mandatory,definite no question,a must
Keep goin'time,keeps goin', the truth is glowin'
Everybody knows inside
Who makes the world dance,world wide!
Do the Doug E. Fresh Groove or the James Brown Slide
Or the Benetton,we could go on and on
'Till the song is gone or just groove off the 808 Bong
Or take it higher,inside fire,starts to perspire
There's no time to tire
Or max
Try to relax
How could you whip me on the mike?
Chill Will and Barry Bee is on the wax
Cuttin' it up as sharp as an axe.....Like this....
(cuts)Cut Professor,Chill Will (repeat)
Lesson in dressin' some rappers be guessin'
Short changin' you,it's so depressin'
Transgression,Hip Hop session
All we use is spirit,heart and a whole lot of flesh and bone
All rhymes my own
Kickin' it wicked on the microphone
Solo,hollow,Hip Hop desperato
Don't play me homeboy,play Lotto
Keep the party flowin' as time pass by
And some ask the question,Why?
Will I do it,run right through it
Those that know me,they already knew
It was dope,before I did it
Left an impression,how can you forget it?
The Greatest Entertainer that's my name-a
Flakin' and breakin' on the stage is my game
Rock the whole house 'til the party is through
I won't ask who 'cause now you know who!

Crazy ’Bout Cars,The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"(chorus)
I always been Crazy 'bout cars
From Jettas to Jaguars
BM's are cool
But Mercedes rule
I always been Crazy 'bout cars
Drivin' down the street and I can't stop
And it's gettin' kinda hot so I might take off the drop top
And see the pretty girls as they walk by (honk honk)
Yo baby you want to go for a ride
K.K. (""Yo Doug,her come the cops!!"")
So I have nuthin' to hide
Besides I'm looking for a bride
Let's go!!
Mercedes for the ladies,BM's are cool
But Mazerati and Porsches are the things that rule
If you were raised in New York by now you know
That walking down the street is like going to a car show
Diamond in the back,sun roof top
Chillin' in the scene with the gangster lean oo,oo,oo
K.K. (""Yo Doug,the cops is tailin' us"")
They better stop or pretty soon they'll be mailin' us
An apology note,we don't work on the street
They better go ride behind a Suzuki cheap Jeep
(But,but)
But what?Go to sleep!
I'm waitin' at the light so I can go
Homeboy in another car yelled out ""Yo!""
Chill Will:(""What up Ha,what you doin' today?"")
Yo,why you drivin' that Hyundai?
Chill Will:(""Oh,I'm coolin' today"")
Well I'll see you later on tonight
Chill Will:(""Okay"")
K.K.:(""Hey yo Doug,the light is green"")
Thanks,but anyway.....
(chorus)
White sweater,blue Jetta or Saab nine thou
Turrrrbo,how you like me now?
Howya,howya,hawyah like me now
Howya,hawya,hawya,hawya like me now
Phil Rizzuto say's ""Holy Cow""
How yah like me now?
Now bus it.....
I'm drivin' in my real fly transportation
Pushin' eighty-five to my destination
Me and my girl and I'm on the lean
With my Saab stick shift in between
Pushin' it,huggin' the road so tight
'Til hear a siren and a real bright light
Didn't pay no attention with the cruise control
Until I heard a deep voice say
Chill Will:(""Highway patrol"")
So I pulled to the side and I started to laugh
Cause I think they wanted my autograph
Ha,ha,ha,ha,but anyway
They got their car started over to mine
Registration,insurance I could not find
He had a smile on his face like your ""ass"" is mine
Chill Will:(""Boy,your ass is mine!!"")
So he got out of his car and approach my window
Waitin' for me to like give him the info
I reached over,gave my girlie a kiss
Put the gears in three and I did like this
VVVAARRRROOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM
I was doin' 120 my girl started to remind me
Cool and calm they was right behind me
My girl say
Dawn:(""Doug E.,don't press your luck!!"")
I said lucky for me that I don't drive drunk!
I was coolin' (and by the way)
I was rullin',know what I'm s-s-s-s-s-s-sayin'
So movin' right along to the end of the story
Cops were on my tail and really started to bore me
I adjusted my mirror to see much clearer
Cops were gettin' nearer
So I had to prepare her
Fasten your seat belt one more exit to go
Then I pushed the Red Button on the Saab Turbo
We was outta there as the wind blew her hair
Her lips and legs showed alot of potential
The rest of the story is confidential
Know what I'm s-s-s-s-s-sayin',ay-yo

Africa (Goin’ Back Home),The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"When I left to go Africa people said....
Don't come back with no with craft on your head
I just left the comment blank and kept my cool
Because they only said what they was taught in school
Brainwashed education
Of our nation
Publicized in its prime
To be behind the time
Adequate excuse
And all verbal abuse
Our history is a mystery
So what's the use???
Sala mali cume,mali cume salaam
Sala mali cume,mali cume salaam
Sala mali cume,mali cume salaam
Now I took me a trip to Africa
A seven hour flight from America
I got off the plane and what did I see
But some brothers and sisters who look like me
Warm greetings,hello,hi's
Alot of mosquitos and a whole lot of flys
Young ones try to persuade you to buy
To feed their families so no one dies
Of hunger,shelter,clothes and starvation
In the ghetto it's the same situation
Over big water so far I roam
To find my way back home
To find my way back home
To find my way back home
Now I woke up at two in the afternoon
In the middle of December which felt like June
I got on the bus,then all of us,caught a boat
As we listened to the jams we wrote
As the boat stayed afloat and we was close to shore
I seem an Island one I felt I seem before
I was gonna ask the guide,but I forgot his name
So I said,""It ain't nuthin',all Islands are the same!""
Shame,who's the blame for that inside shame
Then I found out Goree Island was the name
Aim was to proceed with the mystery
Of the hidden,forbidden history
Goree Island was the last place the slaves was brought
Before taken to America,sold and bought
And I could feel it in the air when my feet touched land
To be the first rap group to rock Africans
Our distant brothers,great,great grandmothers
To one another,it's you I salute
Because a man without history is like a tree without Roots
So I say now....
Now I took me a trip to Africa
A seven hour flight from America
I got off the plane and what did I see
But some brothers and sisters who look like me
Warm greetings,hello,hi's
Alot of mosquitos and a whole lot of flys
Young ones try to persuade you to buy
To feed their families so no one dies
Of hunger,shelter,clothes and starvation
In the ghetto it's the same situation
Over big water so far I roam
To find my way back home
To find my way back home
To find my way back home

Album:  The Greatest Entertainer 12""
Song:   The Greatest Entertainer
Topic: The Greatest Entertainer
Got more jucie than you get in your container
But to say fresh, as we are fresh
And leave everyone with a smile
I though the proper thing for me to do is to come back doin' the beat
Box
Harmonica Style...Bust it....Bust it...
Now the proper thing for me to do is to use my style
Come out a little different and plus worthwhile
Leave the girlies with a smile
Couples down the aisle
Hip Hop troopers in single file
And you could hear the invitation
On our rado station
Before we go, we need some motorization
So ladies, you wanna rock with me?
""Yes we do!""
Chill Will, just hit me
Fellows, are you with me?
""It's only right!""
Barry Beee, get busy, come on
(Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go Go)
The music is movin'
And homeboys is coolin'
And everything is on schedule
And I'm rulin'
The mike with one hand
Runnin' down the plan
The name of the game is to understand
Ladies first and homeboys come second
And I hope that I can recognize
The difference in the girl and the guys
'Cause some men want to be cutie pies
I'll say it again, like I said it before
""Yo, he's not the Herb""
Word to Big Bird, hops
I'm not the Herb that you're lookin' for
I'm the
Greatest Entertainer
Now I could even do the beatbox when I cough
And no, I'm not soft and I don't play golf
But yes, I rap
Like a jolly ole chap
And like a Chameleon, I'll adapt
To a phrase and make the ladies go crazy
I don't want no one to praise me
Just realize this jam is the move
And bust the groove 'cause I'm smooth
And bust the new dance called the Doug E. Fresh groove
Swing on it
Makin' rap music is our profession
There's only one chance at a first impresson
But there are times with records you hear
That out of nowhere seem to catch your ear
Attention and you mention it
To your friends and they say
""That was DEF, play it for me again""
So first you try to find it
And then you rewind it
And then you say, ""who could have designed this""
Growin' to know that it's only me
Chill Will and Barry Bee make G.F.C
And I'm the, and I'm the, and I'm the, and I'm the
Greatest Entertainer
So clap your hands everydoy
And if you feel good, stomp your feet
'Cause I'm 'a rock this rhyme on the solo side
And Get Fresh is gonna hold the beat
Bring it down
The time on the clock was made to tell
We be kickin' and tickin' and rockin' you well
This time, we'll rock stronger
And last much longer
Money back guarantee, we are gonna
Show you things you never thought to see
I know I know you know because we're G.F.C
We're gonna show you
I know it'll grab you and hold you
And if it don't like it, it'll grow on you
But then you won't' know how to get away
But that's all right 'cause it's OK
And it's soothin' music and this I swear
Not 'cause it annoys to the human ear
Talented brothers with a bouncin' beat
And we learned our music from New York streets
Don't drive a blue sedan
And it's things I can't stand
I hate hearng ""I can't,"" I know you can
Be smart, be wise, and keep stars in your eyes
And keep your mind from the killer, ""GET HIGH""
My word is my sword
And I use my vocal cords
And I'm jammin' in the name of the Lord...

Lovin’ Every Minute Of It (The Cyclone Ride),"Oh, My God!",1986.0,"Good things are given to those who wait
I’m a real strong believer in the power of fate
Like if you do good and the feeling is true
Only real good things come back to you
Now rappers rap, DJ’s DJ
There’s 24 hours in just one day
But in just four minutes of your time
We’re gonna dazzle your mind between the cuts and the rhyme
One DJ will rub it, the other, overdub it
And I just (“Lovin’ every minute of it”)
And who am I? (*scratched* “Doug E. Fresh”)
(“I can’t wait”) (“Let’s go”)
I don’t rock for the money, wealth nor health
I just love to keep a good name for myself
Singing prime rhymes on the microphone
With more twists and turns than Coney Island’s Cyclone
MC’s to me are particles
Magazines try to diss us in articles
People want us to stop but we can’t stop
Like I said, The Cyclone, well, here’s the drop
(“Let’s go”) Moving so slow but yet so fast
And you heard the old saying “save the best for last”
But in this case, without further ado
They’re called +he Get Fresh Crew and we came to the rescue
We are in here loud and clear
After witnessing this, you cannot compare
One DJ will rub it, the other, overdub it
And I’m just (“Lovin’ every minute of it”)
Somebody say ‘Lovin’ every minute of it’ (“Lovin’ every minute of it”)
Now bust it, all MC, DJ’s might be okay
Compared to Chill Will and Barry B, no way
In hell, you can tell, me, capital D-O-U-G E-period, that you’re serious
Give him some Bufferin, I think he’s delirious, right? (Right)
It’s alright, right (Right)
Doug E. Fresh is gonna make you feel it’s that tight
Doug E. Fresh is gonna rock the house tonight
I’m gonna, I wanna, I’m gonna, turn off the lights
And act like Kentucky Fried and treat you right
(“Everybody dance”)
Somebody say ‘go, go, go, go’ (Go, go, go, go)
Somebody say ‘go, go, go, go’ (Go, go, go, go)
Somebody say ‘ola, ola, ola’ (Ola, ola, ola)
Let me hear you say ‘ola, ola, ola’ (Ola, ola, ola)
Now bust it, Chill Will got skills that could amaze and thrill
Any wildstyle DJ and guys are ill
From uptown, downtown or on the hill
If you battle Chill Will (I’ll dog your grill)
And you and your crew are gonna walk the mill
So, take a chill and be like Will
And rock a whole party from 9 until
No matter what, even if time stood still
And he never ever paid a Con Ed bill
One DJ will rub it, the other, overdub it
And I’m just (“Lovin’ every minute of it”)
Now bust it, the real Cut Professor, DJ Barry B
Will leave DJ’s in misery
Singlehandedly make DJ’s see this is not where you would like to be
And call the daily, direct them O-U-T
Of the whole so-called rap industry
Make them kneel on with me, repeat after me
Say ‘Cut Professor, Cut Professor, Cut Professor Barry B’
One DJ will rub it, the other, overdub it
And I’m just (“Lovin’ every minute of it”)
I told you what The Cyclone does
You were scared (no, I wasn’t)—yes you was
Yes you was, yes you was, yes you was (say what), yes you was

She Was The Type Of A Girl,"Oh, My God!",1986.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true
The names have been changed to protect the innocent
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Say what
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Warm it up, warm It up
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”)
(“Man…”)  Sing

She was the type of a girl any man out here would choose
With this girl on your side, boy, you could not lose
She was the type of a girl you would be with ‘til the end
But after you were through were her, she’ll talk to your friend
Now break
Warm it up
Chill Will and Barry B
Warm it up, warm it up now
Go, go, warm it up, warm it up, make it hot now
Just warm it up, make it hot, here we go

I went out Easter Sunday to make some noise
I went to Red Parrot with the Get Fresh Boys
I had a good time but I forgot about the time
Got home late and made up this rhyme
It’s not a global rhyme that’ll hear from a crew
It means a lot to me and I hope it does to you, too
Or the few of you and you know who specifically I’m talking to
Let me tell ya about a girlie girl that I had
Before I did show, she used to get me mad
And start an argument for nothing at all
And tried to break my momentum with one phone call
Leave before the show, steaming like a locomo’
I did it so much that I became a pro
At leaving my emotions stacked up inside
And saying she’s right and swallowing my pride
‘Cause, that’s the type of girl that she was
But let me tell you something Doug E. Fresh does
Not stooping low but now he sounds so crow
My heart says “yes”, my mouth said “no”
There’s the info on the way it should go
And make sure it doesn’t happen to you, my brother, also
You wanna finish? Don’t get me wrong
The love was so strong, I wrote this song
Here we go

She was the type of a girl any man out here would choose
With this girl on your side, boy, you could not lose
She was the type of a girl you would be with ‘til the end
But after you were through were her, she’ll talk to your friend
Now break
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Warm it up
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Make it hot, warm it up
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Warm it up
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Warm it up
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Warm it up now, make it hot now
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Warm it up, warm it up
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Yo…
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) Wait a minute…

Before I go further, I must say this
This is not whatsoever no type of a diss
Simple joke or strong itself
Just a feeling that I feel most people have felt
There’s a great old saying that people still say
“When the cat’s away, all the mice will play”
But I ain’t no cat that eats Frisky’s buffet
My name is Doug E. Fresh and I love great days
I don’t eat meat, just fish fillet
And I keep new rhymes on layaway
And I like my girl respectful, not disrespectful
That’s the only way that she could be acceptable
In my life and before the wife
Now you can have fun, don’t be no nun
But I don’t like a girl that’s on the run
To the hip-hop shows with new crows and sparrows
The only run I wanna see is in your pantyhose
If it’s all about you, and all about me
Well, that’s the way it’s supposed to be
And I’ll treat you good, like you knew I could
And if your friend said talk to him, I think you should
Not waste your time listening to me rhyme
I’m only 19 and I’m in my prime
And it’s summertime, and it’s our time
But if the girlie ain’t right, she get none of mine

Hey fellas, check this out
Now if you got a girlfriend that guys like a lot
But the only problem is she’s burnin’ hot
Very disrespectful and not true blue
And if your father was around, she’d talk to him too
Then look around face, and then say “you’re through”
Inside you cared but you know that you had to
Your friend would talk to her, he’d be glad to
But have her look ‘em both in their face and sing
“I’m not mad at you, I’m not mad at you”
Ay, and as for your friends not really friend
Make believe person that’s out to pretend
Cut ‘em off, ha, and start all over again
And watch ‘em wanna say ‘hi’ while you’re in your Benz
And you could laugh a little bit, look in his face
And put your foot on the gas as you play this tape

She was the type of a girl any man out here would choose
With this girl on your side, boy, you could not lose
She was the type of a girl you would be with ‘til the end
But after you were through were her, she’ll talk to your friend

Warm it up
Get busy
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”)
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”)
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) You know, you know, you know
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) You know what time it is
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) You know what time it is
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) You know what time it is
(“Man…”) (“Oh no”) You know what time it is

Trustin' what's in store for sure
As you and yours fill all dance floors

Shown and proved through true statistics

And my style is never rearrangable
In an emergency, you could call me
What I just said could never be changeable (because)
These are the words that’s often heard
They hate a Doug Fresh MC’s preferred
Our rhymes are so delicious and eatable
And although undefeated, they wasn’t beatable
There’s no cure to the hater, it’s untreatable
And our show, mmm, it’s unbelievable
Because to many we’re an idol, and this is very vital
Battling me would be suicidal
And keep on to the break of dawn
And yo, go to get it, go the ass off
It’s like that y’all, and you know, you know

D.E.F. = Doug E. Fresh,The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"I'm the beat box original
Cool individual
Rockin' for no one, some funds is my residual
Salary, calories in just one rhyme
Would last any even a whole life time
Dictate, conversate, translate, lose weight
From 1987-88
And the years to come
The bass will still be dumb
And bounce
Sellin' DEF rhymes by the ounce
And if you ain't wit it it's the thought that counts
'Cause they call me Doug E. Fresh
Cause known I'm DEF and the initials of my name is D.E.F
Know what I'm sayin'
I ain't playin'
Picture this...
Standing outside in the front of the place
Eyes hypnotized by the sound of the bass
Kickin' it wicked I wonder who it is performing
Cops barricade so the crowd won't storm in
I'm in the middle of this and and I'm left unknowin
Standing and plannin' if the groups not showin up
But the tension of the crowd is growin' up
Out of adolescence to a full size problem
And if I have problems I solve them and they, and they
Pointed in the direction headed for the door
As my mind recalls being through this before
So I'm figuring and adding and here I am mad
In a way getting closer to the metal detector
Pass my shank to the cut professor
I was taught to never roam as they check my home boy
And find out the shank ain't nothin' but a comb
Through a distant block I didn't come to rock
I came to put the whole place in shock
But this girl followed me just like a shadow
I told her to chill because I know the girl
Had no reason for teasin'
Because it ain't skeezin' season
Me and the fellas were just breezin' on by
I didn't want to dis'her so I said Hi
And capitalize in what I specialize in
And begin to get down into something more important
While the DJ spins the records
And I recon without double checkin'
I have you spell bound in the average of a second or less

Cut it up Barry

Trend setter, get up and go getter
An MC mention my name he know better
To disrespect my intellect
While I call checkmate, he call check
Bitin' his nails like a nervous wreck
Hearin' record after record at the Discoteque
Rhyme on time as the climax climb
Now you think I'm all geesed 'cause I'm bitter as a lime
And I'm not here to represent
All rappers rap intelligent
But each rhyme being stated is well past decent
Some of them are old and some are quite recent
Most of them licensed by the police precinct
Quite frequent
Everybody (Get Fresh Crew) Got 2 get some (Say what?) (scratch)
Cut professor, casual dresser, body inspector, girl selector
Call him the creator or Barry Bee
And he's the master of scratch philosophy now
Cuttin' it up with a flick of the wrist
Bar' do it something like this, come on...
(Break)
Cut Mix Maestro
Cuts are nitro
Glific teriffic I'll be specific
The words I say shows much significance
And for instance
If you take the time to figure out this rhyme
You know it makes since
Get busy...
(Break)
I'm an articulate brother that's hard to describe
Living the laws and I'm from the Twelfth Tribe
Eat real well and I dare not Gel
And clientele don't make me swell
New York City is where I live
And up lift the spirit is what I give
Word to Big Bird I ain't so Saint
But our show is so ""Dope"" that you're bound to faint
And if not you're gonna leave exhausted
Saying to yourself that Doug ain't lost it
Rockin' all night with the real number one
And ""THE SHOW"" is so hot you could call me Sun
And I just begun...

Ev’ry Body Loves a Star,The World’s Greatest Entertainer,1988,"Everybody loves a star
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, Chill Will and Barry Bee make the crowd come alive
And check out the science I'm about to droop because...
I'm like a lion
From Mount Zion
Upon the hill move closer
Feels like a roller coaster
With a thrill just drooping
And never stopping
Until it reach every Hip Hopper
Or Bee Bopper in the streets
A man of mission
Tradition, plus
Fun and action
And Get Fresh
Won't rest
Until the job is done
Lights, camera, action
Now I've seem stars in all different forms
Some are ambitious and love to perform, alot
Some drive up and down the block
Like a big shot
And hey, Why not?
'Cause the girlies are with it
And look at you as a Czar in a car
A neighborhood super star
Romeo for thou
There you are
Just driving and ruling
Learning back, cooling
Growing and showin and knowin'
Girlies be droolin
About you and
Not about to about face
Can't leave your place
Got your whole neighborhood lost in space
You destroyed your community
Killed your unity
Smashed all dreams, hopes and opportunities
You know what?I'm not mad at you
You just doin' what you seen the next man do
Now every kid on the block
Is huggin on your jock
And you frontin like you a really real hard rock
Soft as a pebble
Working hard for the devil
But you and the devil are on a whole different level
You got a chance to grow
'Cause you know
That the man who made ""All the way to heaven"" and "" The Show""
Is coming extra firm and full of determination
Collaboration of a new creation
Giving you, the insensitive of who you are and remember
Here's a real short story of a girl I knew
Who was very close friends of the Get Fresh Crew
She was livin' col' wrong
Hung out all night long
That's why I had to mention her in this song
She had a real nice shape
Got high as an escape
And just loved to hear a DEF hip-hop tape
Of the latest, greatest MC clones
And the name right now I'm gonna leave unknown
But she was too quick
Too slick and trick
But was a sure vick
For many men who was out to stick
And caress her body
Him and everybody young and dumb
And was a stone cold hotty
Workin' 9 to 5 right on the Ave
For what she have
And not need
Need and not have
And when I drive by
She always say "" Hi""
And I'm not that fly
That I can't reply back
Even though
I know she's not up to par
