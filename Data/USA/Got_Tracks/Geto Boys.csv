Mind Playing Tricks on Me,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"I sit alone in my four-cornered room
Starin' at candles
Oh, that shit is on?
Let me drop some shit like this here, real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies bein' burned
Four walls just starin' at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't livin' right
But I ain't goin' out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweatin' and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin' my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But fuck that shit! There's a nigga tryin' to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind's playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin' ain't right
I feel I'm bein' tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lyin'
I was scareder than a motherfucker
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's goin' down, let's get this shit over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfuckin' trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go because I'm paranoid
I keep lookin' over my shoulder
And peepin' around corners; my mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Prayin' for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is lookin' at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin' fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I die, then my child'll be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feelin' lonely
My mind is playin' tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbin' little kids for bags
'Til a law man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was goin' down we figured
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's the nigga I be seein' in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Droppin' them motherfuckin' B's on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punchin' on the concrete
Goddamn, homie!
My mind is playin' tricks on me",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-mind-playing-tricks-on-me-lyrics
Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta,Uncut Dope,1992.0,"Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fucking mouth
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showing all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
Now, everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
'
Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five, ayo, 24/7
'Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you, wannabe, gonnabe
Cocksucking, pussy-eating pranksters
I : When the fire dies down, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
Feeding the poor and helping out with their bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now, I'm in the U.S. making deals
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean, one that you don't really know
Riding around town in a drop-top Benz
Hitting switches in my black '64
Now, gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangsta here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now, all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eating, cocksucking pranksters:
When the shit jumps off, what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta

Damn, it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play
The real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil J
Now, bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out
And end up hitting the ass with the meat
'Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game-players
And everything's quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't telling off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All you hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let a mothafucka shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta
(""And now, a word from the President."")

Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Getting voted in to the White House
Everything looking good to the people of the world
But the Mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor getting down
Like letting a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supporting me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
’Cause now I got the world swinging from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-damn-it-feels-good-to-be-a-gangsta-lyrics

Geto Boys
Still...
Kill...

Back up in your ass with the resurrection
It's the group harder than an erection
That shows no affection
They wanna ban us on Capitol Hill
'Cause it's ""Die muthafuckas, die muthafuckas!"" still

All along it was the Geto, nothing but the Geto
Taking short steps one foot at a time and keep my head low
And never let go
'Cause if I let go
Then I'll be spineless
I'm going insane!

I think my mind just goes outta control
And judge your subjects muthafuckas read about
I touch on the shit that they be leavin' out
I seen this muthafucka's 9 smokin'
I seen the same nigga with the 9 die with his eyes open
And simply what this means is
He didn't know that every dog had his day
Until he seen his
I bet you muthafuckas will too
Because it's ""Die muthafucka, die muthafucka!"" still, fool

With guillotines for men
I walk around town with a frown on my face
Fuck the whole world, finna catch a murder case
The murder rate

May increase if you're caught up in the world
While it's dyin', I guarantee you're fryin' 'cause I am
On the verge of knocking muthafuckas out for no reason
Once I get down there'll be no breathin' it seems when
Muthafuckas wanna calm down, put his palm down
Seems I gots to lay the law down
Now it's on pow what you wanna do? I'm askin' you

Step to face I'll break your ass in two, bastard you
Rather swim in some fuckin' hot tar
Before you fuck with Willie D 'cause what I got for
Your ass will make your shit your meal

How many niggas brought they irons tonight? (Tell me)
How many niggas wanna ride tonight? (I do)
Pick out our victims when the time is right
We get they ass up off the corner 'cause they dyin' tonight

Niggas be all up in my mug
But it's a different story when them muthafuckas coughing up blood
When he died, looking in his eyes, was he as he cried
I bust another cap in his ass and he died, time is 5

Niggas be shootin' the gift like they for real
But when it jumps, they ain't got no murder skills
So Bill just chops 'em down, watch 'em fall
And cut they ass head to toe, jaw to jaw

Draw down, I bet your bitch ass holla
'Cause I'mma put a hole in your head
The size of a half a dollar
Fuck around and get your cap peeled 'cause this is

G Code,The Foundation,2005.0,"Man
Motherfuckers just follow a nigga around, dude
That's real
Some shit though, fuck these feds
Redneck, racist motherfuckers, man!

I don't wanna run (run) no more, but I know that if I stop
I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hanging with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dawg I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, 
all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talking prices
 (Hello?)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Prior convictions getting motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside
 and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers separated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time
When you was out here getting money from it everything was fine
Now you crying in your jail cell, stressing on the case
And the D.A. is at a nigga every other day
I can see it in your face, in the middle of your soul
You in question of your manhood homey (Keep the code)

We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets we do battle in the hood
We rely on these streets dawg

Yeah we rely on these streets dawg
I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

See I be on some street shit, don't talk to police
I won't accept a visit from agents who wanna see
If I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfucking nigga through and through, iron gate
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mammy suck his dick cuz he with James
Ain't no motherfucking game, we been living this for real
When the government is working, real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rapping but the homey Lil Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a Rule 35, he informing for the cops
You can hear it in his voice, I done listened to the tapes
Now you showing up in court, testifying for the state

We don't talk to police, we don't make a peace bond
We don't talk to police
We don't trust in the judicial system, we shoot guns
We rely on the streets, we do battle in the hood

I was born in the G Code, embedded in my blood

I'm knowing all the scams, all the tricks to the trade
Know a nigga trying to get clean, and you get in the way
Know a nigga tryin to get green, and you stick out the bait
Cause a nigga like a dopefiend, can't rehabilitate
Still we stickin' to the G Code, we playing by the rules
We don't fuck around with new niggas, cause new niggas is fools
We don't photograph the homies, that'll catch a nigga up
On a picture you a victim, bottom line nigga fucked
Only connect the real, staying down with the true
I got love for you Ant, you a real nigga Spook
My nigga Spoonie Gee, I can only name a few

Mind of a Lunatic,The Geto Boys,1990.0,"Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking, I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place for me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I'm wastin'
The shadow of death follows me, I don't give a fuck
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Looking through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peeping tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I'm cuttin'""
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin'
She begged me not to kill her, I gave her a rose
Then slit her throat, and watched her shake till her eyes closed
Had sex with the corpse before I left her
And drew my name on the wall like helter skelter
Run for shelter never crossed my mind
I had a gauge, a grenade, and even a nine
Dial 911 for the bitch
But the cops ain't shit when they're fucking with a lunatic

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Dreaming of the people I've dismantled
I close my eyes and in a circle
Appears the images of sons of bitches that I murdered
Flashbacks of bodies being fucked up
Once I attack, I'm like a pit on a rage that's going for guts
Boys used to die when I'm full of that fry
I be amping when I'm high
So I say 'fuck' and just let bullets fly
Like I said before, Scarface is my identity
A homicidal maniac with suicidal tendencies
I'm on the violent tip, so yo, get a grip
And bitch, come equipped, ain't taking no shit
Cause here comes a lunatic

My girl's getting skinny, she's strung out on coke
So I went to her mother's house and cut out her throat
Her grandma was standing there, she was screaming out, ""Brad!""
As she reached for the telly, I put the blade on gran's ass
Went to the back and grabbed a shovel
Now granny's on her way to meet the devil
Pulled out my .38 and aimed at the bitch
A cop says (Freeze, motherfucker!) Bitch, suck my dick
I said, ""Die, motherfuckers!"" as I blasted
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scent of buckshots in human flesh
Pigs dying, from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that, cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A raging psychotic full of that Angel's Dust
The cops had the place surrounded
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders were watching; set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit
Scot free
Or all of these mother fuckers coming with me""
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up in an asylum
Bein' treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought up in the mind of a lunatic

November 1st 1966
A damn fool was born with the mind of a lunatic
I should've been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I developed a criminal behavior
Fuck with me, and I'll slay ya
Ass, beyond recognition shit
Your dental records couldn't prove your identity, bitch
I beg your pardon, on talking to Borden
You'll never find a mother fucker, so save your milk cartons
Cross the line, your ass is mine
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Blind, crippled, or crazy, it don't faze me
Your funky ass will be pushing up daisies
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your motherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold to some E&J
Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream
This is fact, not fictional, son of a bitch
I got the mind of a lunatic",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-mind-of-a-lunatic-lyrics
Six Feet Deep,Till Death Do Us Part,1993.0,"There's far too many of you dying

June twenty-eight was the date
Thirty-eight to the chest plate
Mommy dear's cryin at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that every day's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember, G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin
Never missin out on a hood fight
Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything has changed and people are lookin lonely
It's gon' be strange spendin New Year's Eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt... dirt

Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin cause they can't accept my homie's death
Another killin was reported on the evenin news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
Cause on the city streets today a brother just can't win
When the people you think are your friends really ain't your friends
Uh, and Bushwick can't sleep
When everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep

The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin next to me has snapped a flick
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin all the singin I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left
And then the choir broke into its final song
Thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial site
The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block
And that's deep

A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music, so they had to dance
Couldn't tell him nothin, was a player, had to have it
Got caught up in the game now my boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game
We used to kick it on the ave at night
Comin up tryin to have the finer things in life
But now my boy's gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn'ta never fell victim to the chrome
So when I drink a brew for you I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So long, remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive, real partners come together
And you know that",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-six-feet-deep-lyrics

Geto Boys
(G.B.)'98
We gonna set this shit straight, belive that
Don't you wish sometimes you can be free
Free from incarceration
Free from paying them bills
Free to come and go when ya feel
Most of all, free from them haters
Verse 1:
So many problems that exist in my world today
When I'm deceased, I want my little baby girl to say
That he was real
He loved me with all his heart
He loved mama too
Even though they sometimes fought
A young nigga in the ghetto
With plenty of dreams
Surrounded by the police
And many of fiends
At 13 started mobbin'
14 started robbin'
It's hard to have morals and values
When you're starvin'
Abused, misused, and plus a bad dresser
Nobody ever told me I was special
I put a gang of tears in my mamma's eyes
But she died
Before I got a chance to apologize
It hurts to see my baby sister feeling the pain
It hurts to see my baby brother still in the game
Ain't nothin' change but my finances
I still be stressed
All these motherfucking worries got a nigga depressed
I'm just tired
Every night, I pray to Jesus, rescue me
]From the poverty, hate, racism and diseases
So the lord said
He prepared a place for me
And when he do that
I'mma be free, yeah
Chorus:
I wanna be free
No more player hater
I gotta be free
Verse 2:
Now as I walk around in my drawers
Outside smoking weed while I scratch my balls
I'm reminsing on my homies who been lock tight
Or got light
Behind trying to feed their family one night
It's not right
Suppose you watch your mamma suffer
Cause ain't another
Her kids trying they off they ass
It's gettin' rougher and tougher
By all means nigga get your cream
Stop storming what they calling this American dream
And why you looking up for a role model
You be your model
Look who we follow
Niggas forgot about the problem
And single parent upbringings
We doing bad on our ass
Nigga fuck singing
How you gonna tell me to keep it positive
And growing up I didn't have a pop to give
So these mother fucking streets is where I gots to live
Fuck what you saying 'bout me
I'm sittin'on a couple G's and smoking weed
I'm free
Chorus:
I wanna be free
No more player hater
I gotta be free
I wanna be free
Gettin' tired of waitin'
I gotta be free
Verse 3:
Nobody understands me but me
It used to bother me at first
But now my conscience is free
I ask the lord to give me strength
And bless the hood
And keep these fake motherfuckers out my life for good
Knock on wood
I'm still here through all these trials and tribulations
Tryin' to make it
Shit, a lot of niggas couldn't take it
My girls hate it
When I go to clubs and stay out late
She think I'm fucking around with hoes
Gimme a break
Get off my case
Can I be committed to you
And ride 'round without feelin' tied down
Damn girl, I catch enough hell on the streets
When I come home
I want some tender lovin' and peace
No one can take your place, you my ace
I dig your jealously boo
But sometimes I need my space
I keep you laced
Like you won the lottery see
But God damn I gotta be free
Chorus:(2x)
I wanna be free
No more player hater
I gotta be free
I wanna be free
Gettin' tired of waitin'
I gotta be free",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-free-lyrics
Gangsta of Love,Grip It! On That Other Level,1989.0,"I've never been played by a ho
If the bitch is acting stupid she's got to go!
So motherfuck a Miss Sad
If she fucks with me, I'mma kick her little monkey ass

See you hoes got it wrong
Thinks if some nigga say he loves you he ain't strong
Girl, you taking shit the wrong way
And I can tell right now it's gonna be a long day

I got to educate you brothers
If the bitch won't give up the play, fuck her!
Move along to the next trick
See I'm the type of nigga tell a ho ""suck dick""
 ""And if she ain't sucking?""
That's a waste of time, conversation and my fucking
I'll just put my fuckin pants on
And tell the idiotic freak to take her tramp ass home

Cause I don't need a dummy
I need a bitch to lick my nuts until my dick is cumming
And after that she'll earn your glow
Just call me the gangster of love

Call me, call me, yeah
Call me the gangster of love

I like bitches, all kinds of bitches
To take off my shirt and pull down my britches
If she got big titties, I'll squeeze them and hold 'em
While she sucks my dick and lick my scrotum

If she's got a friend I'll fuck her too
Together we can play a game of swi-cha-ru
I ain't the type who gets all mushy
I like to sit back and watch them eat each other's pussy

Weak people might say we're insane
But that's the other damn love of the game
I'll turn your sister out if you fuck with me
You want to know my identity


Bitches look at me like I'm a faker
Knowing goddamn well I'm a motherfucking heart-breaker
I'll have them crying for months
Cause I done fucked their best friends and put a whipping on their cunts
They have their mothers to call
But if you fucked one mom you done fucked them all
And I really don't give a fuck
Cause if your mom offers me the pussy, she's stuck

That's the kind of nigga I am
A pussy-fucking gangsta, goddam
Six different hoes a night
I use lubricated rubbers to make the pussy feel right
Better safe than be a victim
If ya got a jimmy hat go 'head and stick 'em!
I put the pussy in its place
And right before I nut I pull it out, then to the face
And tell the bitch to keep licking
And prepare herself for another 
And when I'm done straight to the tub
Just call me the gangster of love


I'm a motherfucker, I put a bitch through a test
If she don't pass she don't get blessed
If the test consist of fucking my whole crew
Well, bitch, goddamn, that's what you gotta do!
You say you want to be down with Willie-D
But yet you find it difficult to listen to me
Everytime you fuck up and skip a class
I'mma put my goddamn foot in your ass
And if your father wants to buck up
I'll beat the wrinkles out the old mutherfucker

I'll treat a bitch like a queen
But she has to realize I'm the goddamn king

Some jealous punk in town
Told my girl I was fucking around and she's still down!
To do the same you've got to have game
You want to know my name


 Say eh
 Yo, what's up D?
 All the hoes mad at us cause we ain't paying for the pussy
 Fighting over their asses and shit
 Yup, that's that other level of the game again
 Damn straight
 Say, man, while we on the subject of hoes
Whatever happened to the ho you used to fuck named Cathy?

Oh, Cathy, that ho was hot
The first peace of pussy that I ever got
She fucked me till I was coming
Put my nuts in her mouth and started humming
I said shit commence the checking
She started scratching my dill-bag and said hold up a second
Turned me over on my back, gold
Opened up my butt cheeks and started licking out my asshole!
That's why I guess that I'm the gangster
And Kathleen Johnson, sweetheart, I'd like to thank ya!

Little hoes out there are getting stuck
By niggas like me and we really don't give a fuck
Big-ass titties and the sexy switch
Whatever you got, you deserved it, bitch

See uhm, I like to take 'em fast
Act like I love 'em and dog their motherfucking ass
Like for instance Ms. ""P""
The bitch ran a game and tried to fuck over me
But I sensed it in the making
Talking about she's pregnant
 ""From you or that Jamaican?""
She said me, of course
So I drug her little ass like a motherfucking horse
That's what you get for trying to play me
I'll kick the bitch smack dead in the ass if she ever say we
Made a kid when I make it
I'll grab her vile motherfucking neck and try to break it
Cause I know I wore a fucking glove!
You know who you fucking with, bitch?",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-gangsta-of-love-lyrics
Bring It On,Till Death Do Us Part,1993.0,"Cover your dome or feel a motherfucking Glock
The rugged child is in the house, I'm letting off shots
Biggity bang biggity bang, hit the motherfucking deck
I'm down on this track and I'm abouts to get wreck
I'm coming like a hustler, never coming buster
Blasting on you hoes screaming, ""Die, motherfucker!""

Bucking with the 5th ward will get your motherfucking dome peeled
Motherfucker bring it on

Bitch deceiver, nigga life-reliever!
Oakland hustler, never been a busta
Make way for the nine-trey, I'm coming motherfucka
Straight from the 6-9, the final line village
Doing more damage than a Exxon spillage!
Uh, coward, and that's that
I'm known to pack a gat and put heads on flat
No rehabilitatin' my trigga'
Take a nigga out the ghetto
But you can't take the ghetto out the nigga
Ain't nothing changed since the 70s
I'm hellbound nigga, my life ain't never been heavenly
Never slippin punk no, a nigga don't lag
Game tight replace a nigga's Nikes with a toe tag
His zoom, his ass, his zigga I'm the founder
Stacking up bodies like Jeffery Dahmer
Oh, here comes the flow, watch me as I tip toe
To a nigga's window, with my M 6-0
Putting motherfuckers out their misery
And watching the murders reenacted on Unsolved Mysteries
Trick, coward lame pussy ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with the worms and the maggots
Nigga's can't harm me, Rap-A-Lot army
Coming like Desert Storm, you've been warned
But if you still want some, nigga, bring it on!

Too Much Trouble done sewed up the tracks
Bitches not playing like they win or get smacked
By some young niggas that's down to break a bitch
The Nickel Nut and the Band-Aid Bandit
Yes the Nickel Nut pimping ten different sluts
You've encountered slavery bitch I don't give a fuck
That better turn some tricks, a suck a lotta dicks
And come with my money or they get their ass kicked
Geto got hoes on the stroll making my bank roll
But when we tangle bitch, I run with foes
Cause all about the pen, ain't talking about the pussy
I'm talking about the paper, so bitch shake your money maker
It's the pimp pimp pimpin, you're simp simp simpin
Your bitch chose me now you're wimp wimp wimpin
Nigga you was wrong when you reached for your chrome
A slug to your dome, bad news done beat you home
You think we was acting about making but you're wrong
We in a pizzimping and its on so bitches bring it on
Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!

Bring it on motherfucker, here I come with this damn thang
Boom boom boom, and I'm about to make freedom ring
5th Ward Boys coming hard for the nine trey
I'm down with them Geto Boys so make my motherfucking day
The 5th Ward Boys on the motherfucking set
Putting a slug off in your chest
Cause you didn't wear the bulletproof vest
Nigga, ratta tat tat to your temple
Shit is real simple, busting up domes like a pimple
Jump if you want, nigga, and I'm a have to hurt ya
Murder after murder after goddamn murder!
Yo I'm taking niggas to the promised land
With little Bushwick, Scarface, and the goddamn peter man
Lets rock stupid fuck is fucking it up with Double O, life is stuck up
For the ten flow, so what you wanna do, ho
Yeah, cause we're checking mo motherfuckers, parking mo motherfuckers
And killing more motherfuckers than any one of you motherfuckers
While your ho sleeping let's get it on
And get your fucking wig split, fool-ass nigga, now bring it on

I can't see your ass bitch, so you'd better watch your bust or
Take that from a blind handicapped motherfucker
Smoking weed and steadily downing that Schlitz Malt Liquor
If you wanna step and get done, cause I'm that nigga
Well it's me that nigga D (Who?)
That fat square twister, the one who fucked your sister
I made her pussy blister, got a dick in the side of my pearl white Lac
Keep my weed in the front and my brew in the back
And my heat up under my seat ready to put the lead on ya
So punk motherfuckers try to test me if you wanna
Cause we're smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime
Smoking that weed, feeling fine
Got me a 40 and a fat-ass dime!

A weed-smoking motherfucker, plus I kick doobies
I'm the one that told that nigga to go insane in that Luby's
Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming, ""Somebody slaughter me!""
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schizophrenic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, cars can't creep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger!
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like recreation of Malcolm X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sitting in church, drinking a 40 of holy water
Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah! (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!
DMG bring it on

I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M-11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for deaf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killings and slayings, some shit
You fake on your tool and find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it: first I walk up on him like I know him;
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they
Business
He's peeping out my missile as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get sound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya
With my Glock, I make it go ""pop,"" it's a 17 shot
So a nigga gon drop, a nigga gon drop
You heard me roll a fatty
Now I'm at the window of your cocksucking caddy
So what you wanna do? It's about that time
Pop pop pop goes the weasel in my nine
Uh, where your nuts at nigga? You'd better let em hang
Cause we can get it on, ho, it ain't no thang, uh
Mo murder mo motherfucking merrier
Cause I be one of the roughest niggas 
from the Hiram Clarke area
So quit running your mouth, bitch, you know you can't fade this
Rap-A-Lot south shit
It's the 3-motherfucking-2
So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of Hiram Clarke, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass every time
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E
Double L-O's not a motherfucking ho
But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on, homes!

It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average, run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize this nigga that you up against;
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once my rifle starts spittin'
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down, I shut em down!
Screaming for vengeance I swear that I meant this descended
Surrender suspended cause, niggas, I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient!
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home, motherfucka, so, uh
Bring it on, fool! Bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)

Chuckie,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"I told you size wasn't shit, that's why I murdered your nieces
Wasn't my fault they found they head cut in 88 pieces
Don't let 'em run, hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm, I grab an arm let's pull 'till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked means you're better off dead
I wanna see food so I fished in a child's head
Motherfuckers beware cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs, mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th the night of the living dead
Vampire arms walkin' 'round givin niggas head
If you didn't die, I would say you got lucky
All bodies found dead, fuck it, blame it on Chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!!!

Aw, fuck, Chuck's on a killin' spree
Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin me
When I murder, I tried to slack off
Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is Chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back
A murder contest, you know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin' hungry, I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs
Bustin' necks with a motherf*ckin' brick!
Half my body is Chuckie, the other half is Bushwick
A short nigga always pumpin' some lead
Haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up? Get up, sit up, you get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a Uzi is my only utensil
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to go against Chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you, how the fuck you gonna duck, yo?
When I'm mad, I'm ready to slay
The graveyards are packed but it ain't nothin' but child's play

You'd better murder me, put me to rest
Cause if you don't I'll come out shootin' with my head in a bird's chest
Pissed off, the way I'm always soundin'
Killed a punk in '82, and they just now found 'im
Some say I'm crazy, some say I'm on crack
Before I die cut off my leg and let me die in Iraq
A born loser, some say I'm mindless
If I get pissed off, you leave naked and spineless
Worse than Charles Manson, never havin' a equal
Went sleepwalking last night and killed 300 people
When I woke up they had me chained to the floor
When they told me what I did I killed 300 more, yo
You wanna rumble? Then go get your war hat
I went to jail for assault with a carjack
I might be small but my nuts are big
The worst that you could do is let me keep your fuckin' kids
Cause I'm a teach 'em how to act
And if they ain't actin' right, they dyin' tonight
So, uh, ain't no use in you tryin' to spot 'em
I send you a motherfuckin' note that says ""Chuckie's got em!""",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-chuckie-lyrics

Boy done fuckin with me, John, man, I done told him
So let's just step out on the block and pd-roll him
Load up the Uzis, turn the village into a war zone
Make the hit, break quick, leave your cars on
Nobody crosses me, especially in this dope game
So raise up off of me, I show em I don't joke, mayn
Little Bill, grab your piece, pick em out
Battle y'all in the street, let's put some head out
Caught my ride, hit the fry, and I step calm
Open fire like a lunatic from Vietnam
Bullets fled to the head, bodies bled
Left for dead, I pumped these bitches full of led
Yo, they don't understand me, the yo, Brad, bwoy
Fuck that, say goodbye to the bad guy

Later on, all alone, sat around the house kickin it
My girl came home, I told her shit had been
Real fucked up, so girl, don't push me
She pulled her skirt up, and said, ""He could need some pussy""
I just sat back, my legs started shakin
Now here's another stupid bitch that I be breakin
I grabbed the slimmy by her hand, and lead her upstairs
Threw her down on the bed, and she said, ""Fuck, yeah!""
I opened up her legs, prepared her for the stabbin
Like Mike Tyson in a brawl, boy, I was jabbin
The bitch was sweatin, but I guess she wasn't bothered
Cause all she said was, ""Fuck me harder, fuck me harder!""
I started bangin, I was bangin, dick was numbin
She wasn't hangin, she was singin, ""Brad, I'm comin!""
Up and down, side to side, perfect timin
I started stickin with the quickness, we were grindin
I was just about to nut, she got on top of me
I heard a (*shot*) Now what the fuck? Somebody shot at me
I took a look, the girl was cooked, her head exploded
Reached for the Uzi at my foot, and I unloaded
Straight out the window I could hear the soldiers' footsteps
I'm a taker, not a faker, I ain't been took yet
So many hunters, dyin faces to the concrete
Although you try to take me out, you die in one beat
Of the heart, boy, how dare you suck on me?
And I'mma teach you and your boys not to fuck with me
Rolled out the backdoor, lookin for his bossman
I'll watch him bleedin, pour his blood in a saucepan
He's in his Cadillac, starin at my frontdoor
I stood behind him, pulled my gun, said, ""What you front for?""
He says, ""I'm sorry, Ak, don't kill me, I was jokin, griff""
That's why your boys are on my balcony and they're frozen stiff
The boy was shocked, then pulled up cops, he looked at me said, ""You're a goner
Cause you shot and killed the boys who worked my corner""
Pulled back the hammer, put my gun up almost point blank
Shattered his dome, reached in the pocket, took the boy's bank
Got out the Cadillac, the copper, he said, ""Stop it, freeze!""
I aim my pistol for his stomach, instead I pop his knees
Fell to the floor, he looked at me and he said, ""Akshun, please!""
I put my gun between his eyes, said, ""Don't breathe""
He took a breath, and he knew he'd breathe his last breath
That's 20 soldiers and copper, 21 shot to death
I had to leave everything I'd ever worked for
But best believe, I won't get sentenced for a drug war
But maybe one day in the future I can come back
But until then, I'm goin home, where I'm from, black
Nobody knows my name, they'll only know this face
And ask my posse, they say, ""We call him Scarface""
Hey Conjo, mayn, listen to me, mayn
Now that we got Texas fiendin, mayn
It's time to make the whole fuckin world start geekin
We expand across the whole muthafuckin world, mayn

Fuck a War,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"[Intro Skit: Army recruiter and 
Bushwick Bill
]
Hello, could I speak with Bushwick Bill?
Hello, this is Bushwick motherfucking Bill
Yes, sir, I'm calling to inform you that you have been uh drafted into the United States military
The United States wants me for what? Hahaha
Excuse me, sir?
Hahaha
Bushwick?
Hahaha, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey what's up?
You need to uh contact your nearest recruiting office
 immediately, please
I see you're not hip to what's happenin'
I don't give a fuck about you and all that bullshit you stressin'
Fuck a war
To explain, let me kick it to you a little something like this

Motherfuck a war, that's how I feel
Sendin' a nigga to a desert to get killed
'Cause two suckas can't agree on something
A thousand motherfuckers dying for nothing
You can't pay me to join an army camp
Or any other motherfuckin' military branch
Of this United goddamn States of that bitch America
Be a soldier, what for?
They puttin' niggas on the front line
But when it comes to gettin' ahead, they put us way behind
I ain't gettin' my leg shot off
While Bush's old ass on TV playin' golf
But when you come to my house with that draft shit
I'ma shoot your funky ass, bitch
A nigga'll die for a broil
But I ain't fightin' behind no goddamn oil
Against motherfuckas I don't know
Yo, Bush! I ain't your damn ho
The enemy is right here G, them foreigners never did shit me
All of those wasted lives
And only one or two get recognized
But what good is a medal when you're dead?
Tell Uncle Sam I said

I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
(Fuck, fuck, fuck a war)
I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
(Fuck, fuck, fuck a war)

In Vietnam a lot of niggas died young
P.O.W.'s got hung
What the fuck do I know about a grenade
All I know is the couch and my 12 gauge
And what if that pin gets stuck?
Several more casualties show up
This shit remind me of a drive-by
More motherfuckers die by accident than on purpose, why?
'Cause they don't know what they doin'
They see if the coast is clear and they start pursuin'
And that's when that booby trap springs, boom!
Blow a motherfucker to smithereens
They send a sucker to your folks, lookin' stupid
Tellin' them you died in the line of duty
Or your ass is missing in action bro
Tryin' to be a damn hero
They bring your folks that duffel bag
The only shit they wanna see is that doggy tag
Hopin' that the worryin' will cease
And your ass will still be in one damn piece
But my mom ain't gotta worry about that there
'Cause I ain't dyin' in the middle of nowhere
Another statistic, a body in a drawer
Man! motherfuck a war!

I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
(Fuck, fuck, fuck a war)
I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president
(Fuck, fuck, fuck a war)

You're lucky that I ain't the president
'Cause I'll push the fuckin' button and get it over with
Fuck all that waitin' and procrastinatin'
And all that goddamn negotiatin'
Flyin' back and forth overseas
And havin' lunch and brunch with the motherfuckin' enemy
I'll aim one missile at Iraq
And blow that little piece of shit off the map
Yeah, 
I wouldn't give a fuck who dies
'Cause I'm tired of payin' these high ass gas prices
Only the rich benefit, it'll be a cold day in Hell before I enlist
To eat shit out a can like a worm
And everyday wear the same fucking uniform
Sores breakin' on my funky ass feet
Skin crawlin' 'cause I ain't took baths in weeks
Not knowin' if I'm comin' home or not
And if I do, I'll probably be shell-shocked
I couldn't get a job, just a free burial
You know how Uncle Sam treat its veterans
Absolutely no respect
Get a plate in your head, lose a leg, you might get a check
Or a goddamn star, you can have that shit
Motherfuck a war!

I ain't goin' to war for a shit talkin' president

Gotta Let Your Nuts Hang,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"You gotta let your nuts hang...

BOOM BOOM BOOM on your black ass, bitch!
Here's another hit from my shit
I made a couple of moves and five-ohs were outsmarted
Here's part two of how I started
Slangin' them thangs on a dope cut
Five-ohs are ridin' my dick, but so WHAT?
What can you do to a nigga like Face?
And why you sweatin' Ak in the the first place?
That's the motherfuckin' problem
See a young nigga rollin' a Beemer and gotta stop him
But I'mma tell you like this, heh
All lawmen suck dick!
Sneaky as hell and try to bust ya
But you can die motherfuckers, 'cause bitch I don't love ya
You're makin it harder, on my fellas
These dopefiend bitches, and the big drug sellers
How can you preach to the fiends that they should quit
While 
Barry's up in Washington smokin' that shit!
You need to get yourself a life or keep tryin'
Or more and more cops'll be dyin', 'cause I am
Sick of seein' niggas bein' shortstopped
By a buck-oh-five, dick in the booty-ass cop
You figure you're hard 'cause you're a cop, see
FUCK WITH ME! I'mma put that ass in a box, G
'Cause I don't give two fucks about ya punk
You may carry a .45 but yo I pack a pump
And you can step up if you wanna, bitch
I ain't askin' no questions, I'm goin' for my shit
I'm runnin' up I ain't afraid
I'm from the land of the heartless, the home of the paid
And if you want a gang no thang
I get my ass taxed, but I'mma STILL let my nuts hang!
You gotta let your nuts hang...

Barney calls me up he needs a ki'
But I can't give it to him, he ain't got 30 G
A Cuban on the Southside sells for 33
I'm goin' 12 and out because the shit is hurtin' me
The dope is gettin' short up in New York too
We sell it for 33, they sell it for 42
See what we gotta do is come together
They're tryin' to cut shit short, and they will if you let 'em
Now let's go out on a boat, YEAH~!
Pretend to be lawmen, and come out with dope
But first we gotta find a bitch with nuts
A down-ass bitch, who doesn't give a fuck
Distracts the cops, on duty
Walkin' around shakin' nothin' but booty
That's when we make our motion
Comin' from a small little island in the ocean
The other group comes in from the Rio
Me, Lil' J, Big Chief and O-Beedo
First we'll hit 'em up with some gas
Then launch a missle on they motherfuckin' ass
That oughta get the shit to float
Come back home slangin' nuthin' but snow
Then the prices'll drop again
Niggas throwin' keys, payin' 10
You wanna get paid mayne?
Well that's what you gotta do; and you better let your nuts hang!
You gotta let your nuts hang... ha ha!

Look deep into the eyes of this criminal
I'm gunnin' niggas down, even women too
Back in the game I used to steal shit
Nowadays I don't sneak, you get killed bitch
And I don't give a FUCK about your rep
I got somethin' for your ass if you choose to step
One nigga from the Park comin' hard
Heh, sendin' motherfuckers to the morgue
Steady gettin' paid, pushin' powder
Cakin' motherfuckers sellin' flour
A brother like the Face ain't broke mayne
Hah, I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Just a reminder for those who forgot
A nigga got paid slangin' rocks
Bring on the magaziney people who ban, I won't duck 'em
They ain't never scared me before, so motherFUCK 'EM
You ain't never seen what I seen
Young niggas killin' people, and beatin' up the dopefiends
So if you wanna fuck with me, mayne
You better come prepared, 'cause I'mma let my nuts hang",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-gotta-let-your-nuts-hang-lyrics

As I walked through 5th Ward,
 I saw this man
He was kind, but he was blind, I snatched his jewelry and ran
I caught up with Box and said, ""I think it's worth a grand""
He smiled and he giggled and he shook my hand
We tried to pawn it in to have some for fare for the jam
He said, ""It's fake"", and I said ""What?"", he said ""I'm sorry"", I said ""Damn!""
My mama threw me out, I called my sister a whore
Now my house is abandoned, my bed is the floor
It's been a week I didn't need, I couldn't take it no more
Saw my teacher Miss Elaine at the grocery store
I waited by her car, she asked: ""Why aren't you in school?""
Put my gun up to her head and said, ""Get in, you old fool""
She offered her keys, cried and said, ""Please!""
She promised not to tell and give me As and Bs
I said, ""I want your money, grub, and all I can sell""
I looked into her eyes and she was scared as hell
I knew she was a snitch, I beat her down with my gun
Got happy with the trigger, now I'm on the run
An assassin

Now I'm just what you expected, a runner out on bail
Hustlin' is my job, and I'm paid well
I'm used to makin' money fast, beaucoup cash
Try to cheat me and beat me, my boss is bustin' your ass
Once lived Sheila, yeah, I meant to kill her
Her teeth was big and gappy, so I called her Godzilla
She planned for a party, she said ""Bring everybody""
No jive, when we arrived we saw Detective Ray McCarthy
He started haul-assin', my Fila came unfastened
I fell and went to jail and came back as an assassin
First I start rollin', my pockets started swollin'
Havin' green is havin' power, and you know what I was sellin'
Now Sheila was addicted, her face looked reflicted
I caught her sellin' ass, then and there I should've kicked it
I drove up to her corner and gave her a grin
Asked, ""How much?"", she said, ""20"", I said, ""Bet"", she got in
I drove her to a spot that was quiet and dark
Yo yo, turned out the lights and found a place to park
Now I knew the girl was ready, she started gettin' sweaty
But all was in my head was 
'kill the bitch like Freddy'
I dug between the chair, and whipped out the machete
She screamed, I sliced her up until her guts were like spaghetti
A maniac, I stabbed the girl in her tits
And to stop her nerves from jumpin' I just cut her to bits
An assassin

Say hello to my little friend
Say hello to my little friend

My father was a priest, cold blooded he's dead
Hypocrite, I caught him basin', so I shot him in the head
Poured on the holy water, ""Bless the dead"" is what I said
Then heard the demon screamin' as his body bled
Now I stole from the poor, lied on the man
Dropped the dime, he's doin' time and I don't give a damn
We're not really greedy, we'll help the poor and needy
We'll rock a show and clock some dough, then drink until we're peedy
Drunk on the freeway just the other day
I saw a fine hitch-hiker, and I wanted to play
I pulled off the road, so I could offer a ride
She said ""Thanks"", I said ""No thang,"" and she got inside
Jivin' as I was drivin', then I asked which direction
She said, ""5th Ward"", I said ""We're from the same section""
Made it to my ave, she got out and said ""Thanks""
I said, ""Yo babe, like won't you chill and have a couple of drinks?""
We went into my house, and I filled up her glass
She drank and got drunk, that's when I got in that ass
I banged it and banged it until my thang got sore
I said ""Honey..."", she said ""20"", I said, ""Get out, you fuckin whore!""
She put on her clothes, headed for the door
Then said, ""Welcome to the disease there is no cure for""
Then she started runnin' and almost got away
With no clothes I gave chase, makin' sure she'd pay
Now she passed by my boy and I knew he was strapped
Red pulled out his gun and shot the bitch in her back
Bare butt-naked I headed for the car
The massacre was from Texas, so I pulled out the chainsaw
Cuttin' and cuttin', he said ""Johny, man, she's dead""
On the news they found remains of just an arm and her head

I’m Not a Gentleman,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"Ladies first, who the fuck made up that shit?
9 times outta 10 it was a bitch
I'm comin' at cha like this
Cause your pussy ain't no more important than my dick, miss
I'm not your motherfuckin' dog
You won't see me runnin' to ya at your every beck and call
Bitches act like they handicapped
Want me to open doors, pull out chairs and all that
I'm the motherfuckin' gangster of love
So how you gonna run me like I'm some kind of scrub
Think your pussy made of gold, well it's not
You couldn't get a dime for it at the pawn shop
I won't pack your bags out the store
Nor will I take you to a play or a musical, whore
And break my neck to be extra polite
I'll take your motherfuckin' ass to a chicken fight
And if you get cold, you gonna sneeze
Cause I ain't givin' you my coat, so I can freeze
People say my manners are minimum
I'm from the ghetto, ho
I'm not a motherfuckin' gentleman
I'm not a gentleman
I'm not a motherfuckin' gentleman
I told you that in the first rap
Hell no I won't remove my cap
When I go to ya moms crib it's on my grill
T-shirt, sneakers and jeans is how I feel
Your mom grit her dentures
Cause I'll be eatin' with my hands not the proper utensils
I say yeah, naw, not ma'am
I was raised like that, so that's the way that I am
I don't give a damn if you ain't got a seat
My feet hurt too, you ain't no better than me
Stand your ass up, wait your fucking time
I don't give a fuck if you're 9 or 99
Drop something if you want to freak
And I won't leap to pick it up like a geek
In a dash or flash, goddamn, I'll pass
I'mma let you bend over so I can see dat ass
I might laugh, giggle, or grin
You could say Willie D is out to win
People say my manners are minimum
I'm from the ghetto, ho
I'm not a motherfuckin' gentleman
I'm not a gentleman
I'm not a motherfuckin' gentleman
Or a nice guy or goodfella
I'll straight up tell a
Bitch, to suck my dick
Fuck that beatin' around the bush shit
When I go to see a ho
I don't knock at the door, I blow
And if we go to a restaurant I don't let her pick it
Cause she'll try to choose the one most expensive
You don't like it when I walk in the front zone
Well slowpoke ass ho, bring your ass on
You say I disrespect women like I'm crazy
But every woman ain't a motherfuckin' lady
I treat a ho like a ho and a bitch like a bitch
And a lady like a lady but I don't sip Dom Perrigion
And listen to Luther or Kenny G, its Geto Boys and Jubiliee
You can't catch me holdin' hands in the shopping mall
If I'm wearin' (?????)
You know I'm gettin' them draw's
People call me a lot of things love
But they'll never accuse me of
Being a motherfuckin' gentleman

Let A Ho Be A Ho,Grip It! On That Other Level,1989.0,"(Yo D man what's up with that cash register shit?)
Oh that's what the average ho see everytime she look at a modern day man
(Ain't that the motherfuckin truth)
Yeah~! And these old fickle-minded ass niggas
Wonder why a ho be with them one day and another goofy motherfucker the next
(I think it's time you kicked some more of that shit D)
Yeahhhhhhhhhh!

It seems to be a lot of motherfuckers blind to the fact
That a ho is gonna be just that
And this type of ignorance is the very
Reason why so many niggas in the God damn cemetery
Intelligence is on call
You don't treat a ho like a queen, who behaves like a dog
Are you the type who won't put a ho in front of a trigger?
Then youse a hoe ass nigga
God damn hound, pound for pound
You knew the ho when she was fuckin' the whole town
She fucked you and gave your buddies a blow
But your trick ass fell in love with the ho
Tried to change her, make her be an angel
You keep puttin' your damn life in danger
Frontin' niggas about that slutty-ass triflin' crow
You gotta let a ho be a ho!

Here's something that I'd like to know (what?)
Why you take that ho, everywhere you go?
You walk around the club wit' the ho in front
Tryin' to keep up with that nasty ass cunt
You say you're captain, but yo' ship she's sinkin'
As soon as you turn your back, the ho is blinkin'
Winkin' her eye at another nigga
But you got her locked down, so you figure
Ho wears your jewelry every goddamned day
But nigga, you just got the ho on display
Wouldn't let her be herself, cause you's a goddamned wimp
Now you know why ho's date pimps
She's a rhinestone freak 5 days a week
But you get mad when niggas pop on her ass
Goddamned slutty ho, the bars are loaded
Don't try to change her
You let a ho be a ho!

She's a ho (D, how the fuck you know?)
Every time I see the ho she's with a new negro
She's the kind of ho that's bound
To wear shorts up her ass when your friends come around
The kind of ho that'll make you cry
The kind of ho you have to call, before you come by
So why you wanna kill when she says no more?
You ain't the first to be dumped by a God damn whore!
Crazy motherfuckers fightin' over hoes
Stealin' for they asses and jumpin' out of windows
If a ho want out, I let her stanky ass go
Cause I'ma let a ho be a ho
Now do y'all follow me so motherfuckin far? (YEAH!!)
(Hell yeah I remember I let this ho named Kim use my car, man)
(Bitch went to go see another nigga; I damn near killed that ho!)
Ha ha I fucked that ho man! (You motherfuckin lie)
That's bullshit, ask Bush.. man ask Bushwick and Red!
{He went up in that bitch man}
{On the f'realla my nigga}
Akshen, man, I'm tellin' you, man!

I fucked that ho, before you even knew her
Made her pussy go BBBRRRRR when I stuck my dick to it
I knew she was a ho the first time I met her
So I got another ho and took her to the other level
Of the game, got them high as a kite
And fucked BOTH of those hoes that God damn night!
Then I sat back and relaxed
As they 69'd, and ate each other's cat
I dropped them off at home
God damn, look at this shit, my wallet's gone!
The hoes beat me but I left it alone
And used that shit as a stepping stone
I played it off the next time I saw the ho
I just laughed and fucked her ass some mo'
She licked my ass, and sucked my balls
And if I see her right now I can get them drawers

Yeah buddy! Willie D ain't gonna let these hoes get him down
I ain't cryin or dyin over none of you hoes
I ain't buyin you no leather, I ain't buyin you no suedes
No jewelry, no contacts, no Lee nails
Ain't buy you no hair, no makeup, food
None of that good shit (tell 'em, D!)",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-let-a-ho-be-a-ho-lyrics

Don't get it fucked up
Hit the strip, get a grip Nigga
And blow some shit up
Talk fast and all ass, Nigga
You ain't got no nuts
Don't trick yourself out your life
You need to hide in the cup
What's up
Come on holla at your boy, real quick
I swallow hard times
And make it come out when I piss
Nigga pop pass the Mack and I ain't black
Picture that
The same Nigga that'll die for you
When you fall get your back

Sendin letters and shit talkin bout how they hate
The album Controversy's they're rebellin

So this is how the D'll respond
I'mma cuss my ass off for your daughters and sons
And if you don't like it spouse
You can suck my dick until your lips fall off

Fall into the club and bitches eyes get wider
I like the way she look up in that liberty skirt
But 95% of the shit is brainwork
I might buy a couple of drinks, and shoot at her drawers
If she ain't talkin 'bout fuckin I'mma get on dawg

Cook it up in momma kitchen, let me get mo' serve
If a nigga catch me slippin I'mma get that nerd

The World is a Ghetto,The Resurrection,1996.0,"What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

Lets take a journey to the other side
Where many people learn to live with their handicaps
While others die
Where muthafuckas had no money spots
And if they did then they ass went insane
When all the money stops
I'm from the ghetto so I'm used to that
Look on your muthafuckin map and find Texas
And see where Houston at
Its on the borderline of hard times
And it's seldom that your hear niggas breakin' and givin' God time
That's why your ask my ma pray for me
Because I know that even I got to die
And he got a day for me
And every morning I wake up I'm kinda glad to be alive
Cause thousands of my homeboys died
And very few died of old age
In most cases the incident covered up the whole page
From Amsterdam
 to Amarillo
It ain't no secret
The world is a ghetto

What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by
Live or die, the world is a ghetto

Five hundred niggas died in guerilla warfare
In a village in Africa
, but didn't nobody care
They just called up the goddamn gravedigga
And said come get these muthafuckin niggas
Just like they do in the 5th Ward
In the South Park and The Bronx and the Watts
You know they got crooked cops
Working for the system
Makin' po muthafuckas out of victims
Don't nobody give a fuck about the po
It's double jeopardy if your black or latino
They got muthafuckin drugs in the slums
Got us killing one another over crumbs
Think I'm lying? Well muthafucka I got proof
Name a section in your city where minorities group
And I'mma show you prostitutes, dope and hard times
And a murder rate that never declines
And little babies sittin on the porch smellin' smelly
Cryin cause they ain't got no food in they bellies
They call my neighbourhood a jungle
And me an animal, like they do the people in Rwanda
Fools fleeing their countries to come here black
But see the same bullshit and head right back
They find out what others already know
The world is a ghetto

What's up outta towner? Southern nigga downer
I wish you would bring your muthafuckin ass around here
With that hip shit shit from your block
You fuck around and get shipped back home to ya momma in a pine box
Cause we don't play that shit in 5th Ward
We got killas and hustlas and playas to so nigga disregard
What your seeing on them western movies
Cause yo! I ain't never rode a horse before
Ho, think we slow? Smash the gas
And watch how fast I'll put these hands on yo' bitch ass
Try to load them dice, you'll meet the gravedigga
Cause game recognize game scheisty ass nigga
See I done seen fools die for less
Than a goddamn cigarette butt, for fuckin' wit my set
So get that frown off your face busta
Cause you ghetto ain't no harder than mine
Muthafucka

What we see (what we see) everyday (everyday)
Livin' in the ghetto this is where I stay
(What we do) what we do (to get by) to get by

We Can’t Be Stopped,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991,"Yeah, it's time to do it like a G.O. once again
You know in 1989, we knocked on the door
In 1990, we beat on the door
Now it's 1991, we finna kick this muthafucka in
Let's talk about a scandal
The album Geffen found too hot to handle
Fucked up the minds of you and yours
The last LP from the Geto Boys
Can you believe those hypocrites
Would distribute Guns n' Roses but not our shit
And they say we're a racist act
Ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black?
Man fuck them hoes
We got new partners and got shit done regardless
'Cause our fans are eveready down to die hard
Around the globe to 5th Ward
I read a news report
Some lawyer in Florida wanna take us to court
Somebody tell that country-ass hick
To go suck a dead man's dick
You scream obscenity, but it's publicity
You want hoes so don't act like you don't know
Better fuck with somebody else before you get popped
'Cause we can't be stopped!
Geto Boys Geto Boys
Geto Boys geto Boys
People are frightened when they hear the Boys
'Cause we ain't just a bunch of noise
None of that 'me-me' rappin'
We let your mothafuckin' ass know what's happenin'
Bitches get raped, niggas get murdered
Adults fuckin' kids in numbers unheard of
It's on the news every hour
Why can't I talk about it?
Everybody seem to be after us
Even the manufacturers
Wouldn't press our disc, you know it wasn't fair
Fuck everybody who work there
And every mothafuckin' reporter
Across every mothafuckin' border
You said the album wasn't coming out fighter
But when it did you couldn't find your typewriter
Keep lettin' the government dictate what you hear
Next they'll put stickers on your ears
Even with that move we got 'em in anguish
'Cause we'll learn sign language
We can't be stopped
Geto Boys Geto Boys
Willie D is the gangsta of love
Some of my friends sell drugs
I sell knowledge that you can't get a ho
'Cause the game is so, not toe
Promoters took away our tour
Negative press made them insecure
And you wonder why you never see a video
Of the boys from the ghetto
No radio, talkshow, or magazine were we in
And we still in the top 10
You can't beat that with a bat
Huh, Hammer can't touch that
We from the mothafuckin' south
Now what was this bullshit about?
That we had to be from Cali or New York
Anybody can make it that got heart
Trenchcoats and gangster hats got my back
Any nigga around me got to pack
So come on mothafuckas, come on mothafuckas, FUCK!

First Light of the Day,The Resurrection,1996.0,"Step out on my corner with my box of rocks
Drama covers my hood from blocks and blocks
See my homie that I hang with
Hit him up with the deuce thumb thang shit
Back then it came with the love and niggas wasn't trippin over scratch
Cause we took turns and we both stacked stacks
And if you had a customer you had him for life
Cause Brad the true hustler granted you right
Cause if you gonna pack leaves then you got to get along
And he who disagrees then got to get him gone
Cause if you start to get paid then niggas wanna flex
And ain't no squabbling these days so niggas brought the tech
And when they find you they sending you to immortal ground
And ain't no coming back from that shit you going down
Now you history with the quickness cause you was
Fuckin up the business
Now what a way to end a friendship shouldve finished
Cause ain't no love for pause in this game
Nigga I'm relentless leaving your moms in the pain
If your ass had to get got then I got your ass
Rude boy mishandled the stock so I popped your ass
I'm so for doe that my mind flows in it for life
That I'm down to let my mind go get it tonight
No understanding when I'm hustling
Because in life all I understood was hustling cause I was struggling
Muscling anything in the way
Of me seeing first motherfuckin light of the day
Chorus: repeat 2X
My pockets ain't hurting thats for certain
You see a broke muthafucker it's a burden
I'm the first muthafucker on the block for the cheese
And I'm the last muthafucker to leave

There was some niggas selling dope down the street I know
You make a left they on the right third white house from the liquor store
You can't miss it cause they be cappin
Pretty cars in the yard
Walkie talkies and security guards
Them muthafuckers had money out the ass and it was evident
By the way they dressed and flashed
Meanwhile I'm on the outside looking in
I got to get them mutha fuckers how can I win
Three a.m. coming from the club caught the pussies
Me and four niggas hiding in the bushes
Jumped out like the jumpout boys with them Glocks and gauges
(whew) You should've saw them niggas faces
Bitches get butt naked is what I ordered
Open the door get on the floor they was slaughtered
(they was slaughtered)
Cause once inside we didn't need em
We knew where the scratch was located six months before we raided
And ain't feel nothing for their family
Cause in this life you take the bitter with the sweet or your gambling
Nigga I'm busting anything in the way
Of me seeing first muthafuckin light of the day
Chorus 2X

Now you can say what you want about my persona
But don't let me hear you or I'm gon' freak you out like Madonna
Sneak up on put my gat to your stomach squeeze the trigga
So close them eyes cause youse a dead ass nigga
Motherfuckers say I'm wrong because I feel this way
But my environment taught me how to deal this way
And if I kill this way then thats the way I got to go
Cause everything you reap in life you got to sow
But I don't care about the paid down the road from a fool
I'm living for today but if tomorrow comes cool nigga
If you think you want to meddle with this
Bring your ass to the square and we can settle this shit
I'm going pop pop pop til your head start swelling
Pop pop pop till your ass start smelling
You cried when your grandma died that was real
But you ain't got to cry no more you going to see her
And newcomers get dealt with
Cause you can't get paid if you ain't part of my clique nigga
I'm bustin anything in the way

Straight Gangstaism,Till Death Do Us Part,1993.0,"Yeah
I take y'all way back

Seven years old, I'm lookin up to the gangstas in the hood
Cause to me and my cousins, yeah, they represented good
Even when we played cops and robbers on the block
Nobody wanted to play the cop, dig it
Cause the cop was a pussy-ass bitch
And if you played the cop, nigga, you got yo ass kicked
I was a curious child
I used to hang out by the ballroom and study the gangsta style
The way they talk, the way they walk, the way they act
The way they wore that gangsta hat
Tilted, rim laid flat out
Now that's the type of shit I'm talkin about
Yeah, cigarette in one hand, drink in the other
Leanin to one side, cooler than a motherfucker
With them gangsta-ass nicknames
Gillie Boy, Pokey, Big Joe, Goldie, and Lil Lane
True motherfuckin mack daddies
Bitch on his side, drivin a '73 Caddy
With a chrome-plated .357
Ready to send a motherfucker on a stairway to heaven
I was fascinated
Yeah, I let 'em influence me, and my momma hate it
But she still gave me love
Cause my momma understood that it was in my blood
See, it was a cycle
And in a few mo' years she wouldn't have to worry about her Michael
Cause I'll be makin my own decisions
Yeah, comin up fast, clockin cash, straight gangstaism

Now it's '93
I got a name for myself
Made a little wealth, played the cards I was dealt
Didn't go for self, now I'm a G
Huh, and every motherfuckin body know me
Niggas in the hood all got love
Cause they saw me raise up from a motherfuckin scrub
And hoes that I know
From way back befo'
They used to say no
All wanna go
To the hotel cause they claim that they intrested
And everybody talkin about the shit that they wish they did
But I surpassed all that
They used to wanna know if I was down, now they don't ask all that
Cause they believin what they seein
A young nigga comin up fast, yeah, straight G

Sittin back as a youngster, peepin out my folks
Some were straight G's and some went out smokin dope
I had to cope with it, be a man and stay strong
Even though some folks didn't think that I'd live long
I watched grandpa shoot dice at the liquo' sto'
Hittin licks in the dough on Ju Man and Big Joe
Walkin out the do' with a gallon of Jack
Sellin straight sens buds cause back then there wasn't no crack
And matter fact, to this day
I'm doin shit like grandpa in every way
I got my hustle on, loc, I ain't frontin
Just a young nigga in this world tryina have somethin
Yeah, that's the environment I know
That's how I was raised and that's how I'mma go
I doubt I will ever be a cell mate
But I do know I'm never goin straight

Hey

What's up J

What's up Will?

What's up now, what's up fellas?

We just kickin it, coolin

Say fellas...
I been kickin a few lyrics in the back of my mind, man
And I'm tired of people disrespecting us
Because we're black-owned and won't sell out
(Word)
So check this out
We need to get together
And go to that other level of the game
And do it like a G.O

Say no more, J, we're on the telephone, man

We get message

Well, let's make em an offer they can't refuse...

I'm back like a rebel 'making trouble'
I'm an Assassin, kickin ass on the double
No motherfucker alive's gonna stop me
So fuck you and your goddamn posse

It's time to step on some motherfuckin toes
(Nah D!) Man, fuck them hoes
The East Coast ain't playin our songs
I wanna know what the hell's goin on
Gimme my card, radio sucker
I'll kick your ass and take the motherfucker
Everybody know New York is where it began
So let the ego shit end

Black radio is being disowned
Not by the other race, but its own
A lot of bullshit records make hits
Because the radio is all about politics
Akshen is my identity, whoever you be
(Don't) (don't) (don't fuck with me)
My last go, the radio struck me with a low blow
Now I'm doin it like a G.O
(Go, go, go, go, go...)
(Let's make em an offer they can't refuse)
(Go, go, go, go, go...)
(You wanna go to war? We'll take you to war, okay?)

Everybody's coming with guns
Niggas gettin pimped by Colombians
They put 'em on the streets like a bitch
Nigga's slangin but the Puerto-Rican gettin' rich
I never sold the mess
But if I did, it would be for my-goddamn-self
Can you adjust to the wholesale bust
Bushwick, tell these motherfuckers what's up

When will you stupid motherfuckers learn
In this game one way or another you get burned
You end up behind bars
Or lyin on your back in a motherfuckin morgue
And your gal'll find another nigga
Cause the low-actin bitch ain't nothin but a golddigger
I'll fuck her but my money is a no-no
(Why?) I'm a ho so I do it like a G.O
(Go, go, go, go, go...)
(Let's make em an offer they can't refuse)
(Go, go, go, go, go...)
(You wanna go to war? We'll take you to war, okay?)

Fucked up politics
Those tie-wearin bitches can suck my dick
They try to ban my style of teachin
But freedom of speech allow me to keep speakin
To the people about shit like racism
It's deep into the heart of the school system
Whites get more funds from the state
And this is why minorities learn so late

Some of us make it to college
And take a test to the highest degree with limited knowledge
Most of us won't pass the bitch
And those rotten-ass motherfuckers know this
I'm not Malcolm X or Farrakhan
After this one, I'll guess I'll have to pack a gun
So if you wanna fuck with this brother
You better be ready, motherfucker
You're gonna have to G.O

(Let's make em an offer they can't refuse)
(Go, go, go, go, go...)
(You wanna go to war? We'll take you to war, okay?)

Willie D is not a biggot and he won't be
I just educate minds through reality
This ain't no motherfuckin 'back to Africa'
Try to pull that shit, we'll have a massacre

Our ancestors were killed at will
Bought and sold like a used automobile
We fought back to race they our color?

Never Again Motherfuckers

Ready Red, comin at ya
Holdin my ground like a motherfuckin statue
You take nothin from me, so stop trippin
'less you wanna take a motherfuckin ass whippin

Wearin dresses and shit, what the fuck, is they gay?

A colorblind society we'll never be
Unless we agree (in harmony)

Hey Jay, this is the President of White Owned Records
We see you're still survivin
But wanted to ask you to keep your Willie D And The Geto boys quiet
If you don't, we will
Or here's another alternative
We take 95% of your company and you take 5
And we'll make you famous within 15 years
It would take you lifetime by yourself
Because you know your people don't stick together
What you say about that, boy?

Man, fuck you

I would advise you not to talk to me like that, boy

Nigga bought his ho a fur coat the next week
And the laws had his ass walkin butt-naked down the street
You want drama nigga I +GOTS+ drama
What about these niggas drivin Beemers livin with they mommas
And what about these tennis shoe chasin bitches
Fuckin athletes, to obtain their riches

Throwin up my deuce sign, fuckin with the street life
Never knew no better cause my mommy never taught me
Going out to get the shit that mommy never bought me
Only ten years old and I can't stay away from trouble
But you don't give a fuck cause you ain't never had to struggle
And everybody's tellin me its get greater later
I need to get my shit right now, cause it ain't shit in my refrigerator
And I done struggled for my whole life
Seeing my moma layed up with a different nigga everynight
And when you see me you can spot a crook
Cause I'm going through her motherfuckin pocket book
I'm going out to get my papes
Cause she don't give a fuck about me anyway
And my daddy's doing two terms
And all she ever does is sit around and get served
My mommy never hugs me
I'm callin deuce my family, cause these niggas say they love me
I'm steady dustin chumps off
And ready for the battle if the shit would ever jump off
So send my ass to hell
It's either being covered up with some dirt, or boxed in a cell
Anyway that's what it looks like
If I don't hurry up and get my ass up out the street life
Chorus: (Spoken)
You know the streets is all I know
This is my way of survival
You know I've been dealt some bad cards
But I gots to play them
What else am I to do, look for a job?
But until them my family will starve and be broke
So I resort to the streets
As a source of income
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm stuck here
I step out on my own block
And everyone's throwin up the deuce to little J-Rock
And all my little homies that I hang with
Are either jackin, or mixed up with this gang shit
See it through reality
Never leavin' the gang cause it's the street life mentality
My homies got a proposition
Pulled the nigga off some change and said he'd help in my position
So now I'm rollin with the OGs
Puttin in work for the jack, for some OZs
And maybe in a year or two
I'll be able to roll in a Benz like the gangsta's do
Makin hoes ride dick
Cause it's poor, broke gangster clique
Ain't hittin on shit
I gotta lock my crew down
And sew this whole motherfucker up like the Jews town
Develop us a strong click
Break my pops off some dope while he rot
Pops would like that shit
Seeing his little nigga on his own two
Doing shit I heard my pops used to do
A real nigga to this crime thang
And had it going on before his time came
I gots to get my shit right
Until my shit gets right
I'm rollin with the street life
Chorus:
You know what upsets me
Is when whitey sits back in they lavish homes and BMWs
And tell me the streets ain't the place to be
See it from my prospective
Poverty strickin, livin on welfare
And the government cuttin that shorter every week
I'm shortin on education cause I'm black
The corner doesn't promise me a good life
But at least it shows me promise
Finally after shit got right
I'm wanting out of the gang cause I'm searchin for a new life
But I remember what was said
You come in alive the only way you leave out is dead
So I'm kinda fucked on both ends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin friends
Cause if they were my friends they'd let me break
Outie five thousand fuck this shit, I'm packin my 38
But first I gotta stay down
Until It's time for me to punch it out and just lay it down
And that's a motherfuckin shame
Tonight I gotta spill another ride with my little gang
So slowly I walked up to it
With no hesitation I broke the window and jumped into it
Unhooked his shit and was headed off
I opened up the door that's what set it off
A nigga came out with a Glock jack
And put a slug in my motherfuckin back
And my so called friends
Want me out of the gang cause they don't know if I'll walk again
Now tell me what's that deuce life

Mind Playing Tricks on Me (Clean),We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles

Oh, we on the radio, dude?

Oh, alright

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls closing in, gettin bigger
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigger
My mother's always stressin' I ain't living right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, every time my eyes close
I start sweating and blood starts coming out my nose
It's somebody watching the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watching my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I hear em call ""burn the rubber""
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a 'caine like my own
Some might say, ""Take a chill, B.""
But I can't G, cuz there's somebody trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in the clip when the wind blows
Every 20 seconds got me peeping out my window
Investigating the joint for traps
Checking my telephone for taps
I'm staring at the woman on the corner
It's messed up when your mind's playing tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me; it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, something ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's headlights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block?
Or is it that clown last week that I shot?
Or is it the one I beat for 5000 dollars?
Thought he had 'caine, but it was Gold Medal flour
Reached under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to me lying, I was scareder than a mother
Hooked a left into Popeye's and bailed out quick
If it's going down, let's get it over with
Here they come just like I figured
I got my hand on the chrome-plated trigger
What I saw will make you start gigglin'
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder
And peeping around corners; my mind is playing tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope
Can't keep a steady hand, because I'm nervous
Every Sunday morning I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And tryin' to find an exit out the business
I know the Lord is looking at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift while I drive
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Bang and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's nonsense
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this
But to me she was just another chick
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely
My mind is playing tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boys are trick-or-treatin'
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a law man got behind our rags
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squabble, no doubt
So I swung and tried to take him out
He was going down, we planned
But this wasn't no ordinary man
He stood about six or seven feet
Now that's a creep I'd be seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them 
5th Ward B's
 on him
The more I swung, the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as death on the streets
My hands were all bloody, from punching on the concrete

Somebody stop the pain!

I finally look to paint a picture of my whole life
And for me to end it would be so nice
Somebody driving on this back street
So I could leave my shit all on the back seat
Cause I don't love my life no more
So I don't wanna fight no more
I felt this way before but it died out
So I shot my fucking eye out
Nobody understands me HELP
But I don't understand my SELF

And my drugs that I take so I'm at

Boldly go where no man has gone before

Buckle up and lets take a ride
I want you to watch me commit suicide
We're headed for a place in a dark land
In desperate search of that dark man
But don't you move keep it right there
I wanna bring you smooth into my nightmare
Don't be afraid of watching life bleed
Explore my every thought, come out and sightsee
There's no man alive, that can promise breath
But once we arrive, I can promise death
And now were headed for the crossroads
Gettin deeper in the lost coves
And once we arrive
Close your motherfuckin eyes

I put the pistol to my temple
See the bullet in the chamber
Cocked it back and out of anger
I pulled the crack, see the shells jump out the side
Now I'm fallin back, I'm seein faces but they're all in black
I'm hearin sounds but I can't hear
I'm seein pictures in my head but they ain't clear
My every picture flashed at full speed
And now I'm feelin like I'm loosin my grips on all reality
But my reality's a battle G
And I was tired of havin talks with myself about mentality
End it all I stand tall apparently I wasn't patient enough to hear the man
Call
So now I leave myself to strive or die, but I've lost all my hopes inside
And I just wanna die
Yo will wake the fuck up

And that's small! And you think you're mackin
While you lackin, Bushwick is packin
I'll show your girl how a real man feels
Large things come in very small packages
And while you're gettin on your knees to fuck
A nigga like me's still standin up
Any bitch, will tell ya
As long as he has a big dick, 
size ain't shit!

Yo Bushwick Bill man, show these ho-ass motherfuckers out here in the game man
That you're too short to take a motherfuckin short
And DJ Ready Red got your motherfuckin back

Liftin weights'll make you bigger
But lift me you'll be a dead ass nigga
You wanna squabble cause you think you're tougher?
{*gunfire*} Squabble that motherfucker!
Those are called bullets, they got 'em in every state
To keep niggas like you in place
And since I'm a trigger happy nigga
Look for your place to be in a
Cemetery, you God damn sucker
Lyin next to another bad motherfucker
Reputation ain't shit cause see
What you done did in the past don't excite me
V-I-C-T-O-R-Y
You can't have it, na na-na na na
Any motherfucker wanna get with Bushwick
Bring it on cause your size ain't shit!

I've been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since...
I've been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since...
I've been a stupid-ass motherfucker ever since...
The penitentiary became my residence
It wasn't nothin for me to disfigure
You lil' nickel and dime ass niggas
Shank a motherfucker in a minute!
And if a riot was goin' down i was in it
Get off work and discuss my pardon
Chill out and smoke weed with the warden
Take a motherfucker like you
And without remorse this is what I'll do
Punk you out and make you be my bitch
And let a nig get shit on his dick for one cigarette
Ain't harder than my dick and you're talkin shit
Carry on motherfucker
Before the state convict me of assault
Or somethin hyper; and I end up right back at 
Rikers
Like a sniper I'm scopin you out
You won't even know when I'm takin your ass out
I'm equipped and vicious, toleratin no misses
Rougher than Ulysses when it comes to bitches
Bitch, yeah I'm talkin to you
Some of you niggas are bitches too!
You gotta be crazy as hell to try to buck up
Or one bold motherfucker cause your size ain't SHIT!
{*scratched: ""Yo Bushwick Bill""*}

Some stupid motherfucker said he had an advantange
Fuck my size! You wanna do damage?
Contestant number one, c'mon down!
You're the next motherfucker I'mma clown
So don’t get excited like your bid is exact
‘Cause you ain’t winning shit but a Goddamn smack
When I throw a motherfucking right cross
And slap the taste out your Goddamn mouth
Now where's the hype comin from?
Don't make me use this goddamn gun
Cause I'll give your ass hell and charge you rent
Fuck you up like a God damn accident!
Innocent is how I look
Cause a nigga my size ain't supposed to cook
You took me for a sucker that day
So bitch you find out the hard way

Dirty Bitch,The Foundation,2005,"You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear
Gotta start with the right material, to generate a useful idea
In other words, you can't turn a ho into a housewife
Try it, the bitch'll make you sock her in her mouth twice
It started out beautiful, but you was playin possum
To me, you was just a fuck, but our relationship blossomed
Got attached to
Your kids, I loved 'em like my own
I loved 'em like my own
Referred to your daughter as my daughter, your son as my son
Called you my
Wife, even if it was common law
Never saw a better creature in my life
How could the one who stole my heart
Make me reach for my knife
(Why you reachin for your knife?) Cause I'mma stab that bitch
(What if they
Take your freedom Bill?) They can have that shit
Now she wanna be friends -
Ain't that a bitch?
Fuck you bitch, I hate you bitch!
I wouldn't care if you burned in a fire
Crashed in a plane or got hit by a motherfuckin train
You make my life a livin hell, the sun's out but it's dark
You're the devil
All you need is a pitchfork
I'm too short to take shorts
I'm havin seconds thoughts, the ride's too scary, I gotta get off
I wish I
Never met you ho
I wanna hang you from a fuckin cliff and let go, you dirty bitch

Why you wanna bring me down
Why you wanna bring me down, you dirty bitch

I once believed that I could save you, emotion was squandered
Now go back to that fuckin rock you crawled from under
I did more fo' yo' kids, than they sorry-ass biological father ever had
That's why they called me dad
Your own momma used to tell me not to fuck wit'cha ass
I messed around and got you pregnant, now I'm stuck wit'cha ass
I gave you everything I had, didn't have to be forced
Why the fuck you wanna take a nigga to court? You dirty bitch
Tell me this, who paid the medical expense
When your kids was sick, 
suck dick you fuckin whore
Burned my car and my clothes, like you were Angela Bassett
I left town, you moved out, all you left was the mattress
Now I'm hearin that you had another man all the while
When I see you I'mma
Beat your ass, so go 'head and file
I can tell by your tone you think it's funny bitch
Where the fuck is my money bitch? You ain't runnin shit
I'll hook you up like your kidneys failed
You think I give a fuck about sittin in jail?
You think I don't know the
Ghetto streets are bumpy?
And you're the reason why them niggas tried to jump me?
At first I was cool with the split
But you keep, callin my new bitch, bein
Messy and shit
You can't stand to see me happy, with or without you
Had to rain on my parade, it was all a charade
You triflin slut, ain't worth a cigarette butt
I shoulda left you where I found you, waitin on a bus
Wanna drag you to a field and chop you up to the bone
You ain't worth the fuckin ground I walk on, you dirty bitch

We needed money; so I robbed a liquor store
Down on your knees you hesitate I kick the whore
Wanted for the bad, bitch I go for broke
Pull out a 9, think it's a game, she said nope
Out comes the manager must have thought I was bluffin him
He knew I was serious saw the heat when I busted him
C'mon motherfucker I ain't playin so give it up
She said the cops are comin, does it look like I give a fuck
You lucky you ain't a ho or I'd be rockin ya
She let down her hair pulled up her skirt and said what's stoppin ya
Bitch you might mistake me for a lolligag
But if I get in that ass they'll haul me off in a bodybag
Give me the money I'm tired of the waitin shit
She said the box is empty, I said ain't that a bitch?
Back to the safe you better open it fast
I'm gettin tired I'm about to nail a cap in your ass

Doin crime in H-Town in my prime
Robbed the same motherfuckers four or five times
Where was the cops when I was rippin off dividends?
Out writin tickets to hard workin citizens
They ain't NEVER been smart enough to catch me
But one day I went crimin with a pussy
He got shot and hit the floor
I ran non-stop to my God damn front door
Stashed the cash in case
A clue led the motherfuckers to my place
I grabbed a bib, cleaned my popper
And what did I hear? A God damn chopper
Damn! Ain't this a bitch?
The motherfucker musta snitched
I thought about puttin some heads to bed
But I played to stay instead
Surrendered, the last day of November
Made bond the first day of December
Promised myself when I see that snitch
I'd kill that son of a bitch
Went scrap to slay everyday
I just couldn't, put the fuckin' gun away
Wait a minute, I'm full of those 40's
Caught his ass slippin at a block party
Killed the motherfucker as he said ""D, please!""
Put holes in his ass like rat cheese

Homie Don’t Play That,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"Don't say I didn't warn ya
About playin' them ho games
Like callin' me out on my name
Some a y'all are still gonna try to show off
And get busted in ya goddamn mouth
I won't undetstand how a man can call a man
A bitch or a ho and be playin'
In my book that's a no-no
Your mouth don't write a check that your ass can't cash bro
Pop you on the butt for what
Niggas done got when they played too much
Willie D'll tap a bitch and that's it
Anything else is punk shit
I'll give you some a this *shots*
And some a this *shots*
Their just special effects but you can bet
I got something to make them hoes ease up off me black
Cause homie don't play that
A lot of suckers got they as kicked
Cause hard heads and rankin don't mix
But if you gonna cap on each other
You gotta know when it's gettin personal sucker
Instead of eatin up your homeboys grill
See that's how a nigga gettin killed
Fools like to joke when your serious
So to kill the bullshit I stopped fuckin tripping with her period
Don't snatch my hat off my head like we're homies
And greet me wit a bump cause you don't know me
Play with your mother or your father
You ain't got no pussy I don't even wanna be bothered
And you bet' not act like you wanna swang
Cause I'm pretty good with them thangs
So call my bluff, do what you like and
I'mma make you read these Nikes
Wrastlin' ain't masculine
You say you wanna go to war B
Instead of tryin' to test me
Horse playin' like an adolescent
Will get your ass wrapped up like a present
Your compliments ain't nutthin' but a racket
Your whole conversation is plastic
You say you like my new jacket
Jealous motherfucka even sound sarcastic
It's in your voice when we shootin' the shit
Maytag ass nigga ain't nuttin but a bitch
Ain't got no back cause your always frontin' black
Man homie don't play that
I don't play that
Lets take it all the way back
Niggas say I'm crazy
When I say keep your comments about my lady
They say ""You're lucky, I wish I had a girl like that""
I never smile cause I know where they hearts is at
All in front of my girl sayin' how pretty she looks
Game recognized, I wrote the book
""Got a good thing, hold tight, don't lose her brother""
You may as well straight up say you wanna fuck her
Still waters run deep man
And ain't nothing worse than one who fronts like a friend
Call your crib when they know you ain't home
Tryin' to rap to your girl on the telephone
Snake in the grass I see him comin
From a mile away I start gunnin'
And everytime one drops
You can see a card wit they face on it in the mailbox
See we ain't that cool
Where you can play wit my girl
And try to get a free feel fool
Or conversate wit us alone
Then I have to step in and stop ya from goin' on and on
With that idle chatter
You say your just bein' friendly ain't that a bitch
You used to be my brother, I'm a father, but the fact
Is homie don't play that
I don't play that
Man homie don't play that",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-homie-dont-play-that-lyrics

For the 1990-3-3
Heh heh
You know what I'm saying?

Gun shots rang out, niggas ducking, what the fuck?
Seen this nigga bite the bullet, it (Damn) fucked him up
Put him outside his innerself
Took his lifeline from him
Never got the chance to see who done it
Just niggas running, breaking to they shit
Befoe' the gun, put they ass up in the mix
And all I seen was him, laid out choking
Eyes to the back of his head, wide open
And I'm hoping that they don't find the killer
Because this nigga crossed a whole bunch of killers
But still a bunch of motherfuckas stand dazed
As they gaze at the corpse
Before they drop him in the grave 
That's all he spoke, lights out at your part
That's all she wrote
Everybody got a time and a place they die
But if your out there crowdin' up your space, it fly

Way down in the south, deep, on the creep
There was a monkey tried to step on big ol' lion feet
Nigga, peep the monkey was the runner and the runner did the dirt
Came up short on my skrilla and got his monkey-ass hurt
What it look like? On the south side it be hopping
Respect grew with the four-five if ya popping
I got him on the camera, fuckin' thief, wanna check mail?
Shot him now another bitch is waitin' just to exhale
But oh well, it's murder, tell me have you heard her?
Four-five knucklehead from the mob ready to serve y'all
Meanwhile, I'ma tell y'all all just what I hate

Sipping on the Hennessy
Look up in the cut, damn, here comes my enemy
Eyes met, and you best bet, she got a bitches deep
Slowly, they moving closer so I taps my peeps
I'm 'bout to take this hoe, break this hoe down like a fresh O
But never let go, up in this game that's how the best rolls
I test those who ain't never seen me jump
Light they ass up like funk 'cause I ain't scared of you, punk
Motherfuckas that think I'll pull this trigga and blink
Leave they ass to stank, then I down a whole drank
Understand, I'm out the do', tag they toe, and leave 'em rotting
'Cause up in this game focus, aim, and you forgotten
I'm mopping on these hoes like they waxed floors

There goes another nigga gone
Blood all over the rug, shoulda stayed his ass at home
Niggas can't get along, 'specially at these clubs
Trying to fuck these same bitches
Strange niggas, trying to check nuts
I just look as I drink my drink and I'm blowed
All of a sudden down to nothing
God damn, there they go with all that shit
Shankinh and shootinh and squabblinh
But you know I'm holdin it down

City Under Siege,The Geto Boys,1990,"I like to teach the world to be
A dope mayn just like me
I like to front the world some coke
And let them sell for me
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
At age 16 I started sellin cheap drugs
Extacy will cost you three
A year later I robbed a dope house and stole a ki
36 is what I count
Now multiply 36 with 700 a ounce
Bag it up and make my profit
But some pussy muthafucka in offices tryin to stop it

And the bastard that's stoppin the bus
Is the same muthafucka that delivers to us
He's payin off the cops
Triple-crossin the middle man tryin to give the smaller pusher power

The politicians are players
Reagan and Bush were cuttin tough on Noriega
Now the juices are sour
Remember politician means schemin for power
(You know what a chazzer is?
That's a pig that don't fly straight) -- Tony Montana

Now let's go back to the past
The motherfucker who needs to be tried is Ronald Reagan's ass
Appointed Bush to the C.I.A
(That shit was cold
Put Noriega on the payroll)
All of a sudden shit changed
Right after '88 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hm - ain't that strange?
Some think I'm goin too far
But if you wanna go to war, I take you to war

They don't care about niggas on welfare
As long as their kind ain't there

You've got my ki's on a freeze
Muthafucka, my city's under siege
(Today's special
Is ghetto dope)

Willie D sell out, you can squash that fast
Here's a hit and a half for your ass
Police brutality is now a formality
They're kickin our ass and we're payin their salary

The average cop with a badge is a bitch
Back in high school they used to get their fuckin ass kicked
All of a sudden they're snappin necks
Puttin niggas in check, makin threats, sayin I'm next

I laugh at a muthafuckin law man
Without the piece, bitch, you're nothin but a raw man
You couldn't hang if you were cappin or punchin
(So go suck a dick and write or ticket or somethin)

Can't understand my city's under siege
Still the Ak be clockin' g's
Got a Coupe De Ville, got a rag and ridin '83s
Copper wanna play the Ak
Guess they think I'm slangin' crack
Motherfuck the 50s, they can't stop me, got my corner back
Rocks and rocks and rocks galore
I left the cut and then I swore
Never be a stupid ass, I'll never leave the cut no more
The dope game ain't no joke

Muthafuckas will die for this, they go for broke
Rock houses open and busted
And the bitch that got you busted
(Was the bitch that you trusted)
Pimp on me, and I'll make bail
Hunt you down and kick your ass through the goal post of hell
(Are you lighter on a female figure?)
Hell nah, I fuck her up just like I fuck up a nigga
Red, grab the pump (Bill, pass me my nine
Now tell em what's on your mind)

You goddamn parents are a trip
The streets got your babies cause you're full of that bullshit
You tell your kids drugs'll fuck up their health
And you're geekin your goddamn self
But I won't blame it all on you
You stupid-ass teachers can suck my dick too
I walk around with a smirk
Fuck school, fuck curfew, fuck homework
And muthafuck a damn cop
I never ride down my block without my gun bein cocked
You won't get a chance to slay me
I won't be an accident like Ida Delaney
So when you step out of line
(*shots*) I'm goin for mine
D.O.A. is how they pronounce you
No suspect, no motive, no clue
When you hoes say 'stop', I be damned if I freeze

Scarface:
I remember in the 80's me and pops would rock
In a 7 0 Chevy with the drops in slot
Use to pass me Pepsi Cola while he drunk him a pint
Tippin' to the southside runnin' a light
Use to have me up in 3rd Ward checkin' his traps
Collectin' his scratch protection' his snap
Use to always tell a nigga keep your mind on paper
Bitches in your head you keep your eyes on paper
Cause a niggas definition is a killa for scratch
You kill a motherfucker you kill him for that
You got caught up in this shit that means you fucked it up
Old man spittin' game so I sucked it up
Old enough to do my own thang got me again
Flip my second paycheck to cop me a lid
Went and seen my homie Short Dawg that slided me a track
Went to Mase's Pawn Shop and got me a gat
Didn't know this crack shit I got my uncle to cook
With my eyes on my paper I just fubbled and looked
Impatiently waitin' for the pot to boil
Man I can't wait to see your rock from ?
Put my work upon the table and it's startin' tonight
Time for me to bring Brad Jordan to life
Sat my ass upon the corner till it started to bounce
Glock scratchin' reach that and started her out
It wasn't long before I was goin' for nine
I'm seventeen around millionaires goin' for mine
And if you got off in my way while I was headed for that
You found your ass misplaces with your head in your lap
And niggas is gettin' shiffer with time
That's why you never see me with a partner in crime
I'm down and dirty nigga FUCK the world
And that's what seperated geto boys from girls you know?
Bushwick Bill:
5th Ward is the spot where niggas get shot
Hoes sell cock and every block is hot
Niggas start shit but they don't start it with Bill
Cause them motherfuckers know they're blood gonna spill
Ever since I was a kid growin' up in the bottom
I beat a niggas ass and if I didn't I shot him
Never gave a fuck about his family cryin'
Bottom line, better his than mine
You come around me with that live shit I kill it fast
I throw a search party for your fuckin' stankin' ass nigga
Cause it's a motherfuckin' rep thang
You got a set of nuts you better let them motherfuckers hang
Even if you're facin' 20 years you never rat
You do your time and you come on back
And if he a homie he really take care of your people while you're gone
And bless you when you come back home
Do your time and don't whine is the motherfuckin' anthem
That's the type of shit most niggas can't 
phantom
Them bitches tongues come unfurled
But that's what seperated the ghetto boys from girls c'mon
Scarface:
I bet you often wonder how niggas survive in a drought
You got jacked and took six and died in your house
And motherfuckers sat and grieved your death
One of them motherfuckers counted up the keys then left
Kind of strange the game it took a change for the worse
Split the brain get the cain get back to your dirt
And keep the jack you did up under your hat
Cause if the word got out you killed him then they killin' you back
I never thought that '86 would bring me trouble again
You'd think but these niggas on some up shit like double your pay
And gives a fuck about respect and joy
So how the fuck you figure niggas got respect for a ho
But then again niggas always put their trust in a bitch
But in the end it's another nigga bustin' yo shit
Fucked around and had to flee the world
Cause you couldn't seperate the geto boys and girls
Willie D:
Geto Boys is the motherfuckin' shit never forget
Them southern niggas made your Mind Play Tricks
Never the less I left the group in '91
Niggas was mad, I had my gun
They had they guns too I wasn't snoozin'
Cause I knew that if it came down to it they would use 'em
If it was goin' down right then I didn't give a fuck
We was gonna tear this whole motherfuckin' city up
And nigga that's real comin' from the south
You wack ass rappers watch your motherfuckin' mouth
Preachin' that positive bullshit you can save
Cause your positivity ain't gettin' motherfuckers paid
It's G.B. and Willie D reunited
Sendin' niggas back to the studio to get they shit tighter
And niggas thought it wouldn't happen again
But we sat down and settled our differences like men
And put the bullshit behind us
Cause fuckin' off money ain't a plus it's a minus
We did what other niggas to big to do when they twirl
And seperating geto boys from girls c'mon
Man on phone:
A.J. you know I spent 23 years in the prison. You know I'm still in prison
You know they they uh uh reannounced us, blacks, we represent 37% of the
Prison system throughout the country. 37%. But we don't represent but but
12% of the country. Now that's diproportionate and ain't no joke you know
It's it's now by coincidence or by ? it's by design. By the year...2015
They gonna have 70% of our community locked up. I'm talking about black
Gonna be locked up within they community. It's gonna be like it war

Time Taker,The Resurrection,1996.0,"Scarface:
As I open my eyes unto a new day
I see the same old shit that I was face to face with yesterday
It's all the same and I can't change time
An example of a young nigga trapped up and his brain's dyin'
I close my eyes to refrain my thoughts (open)
Open my eyes to remain untaught
Why my life gotta have a yesterday?
Why can't I memorize tommorrow and live my life as just a day?
A baby's born and you hears moms cryin'
Is she cryin' 'cause that she's happy or the fact that she know she gon' die?
Probably some shit we'll never figure out
I think my mind is plotting plans and my second mind is trying to take me out
I had a dream I think I saw a dude
'Cause he had the looks that of a killer and he sung to me these four tunes
He said ""Life is like a game of dice
You roll 'em right the first time but you seldom get to roll 'em twice""
Not understanding what he said, doc
I find myself in the middle of life in an infa-red dot
So tell me doctor is you gettin' that?
Motherfuckers bustin' at you with wheels now can you picture that?
That's why you find me an assult mind
Cause in this world we live together but divided by a chalk line
You wanted to hear my life story well I told you
Maybe there's answers to my question in your minila folder
What's the solution to this mind state?
You tellin' me it's gonna take you some time. How long do time take?
I'm losing focus on this straight line
Ain't trying to wait for motherfuckers so now I'm forced to take time
Willie D:
I pull my popper out my trousers aimed it at his abdomen
And grabbed the man's life away from him in a moment
Angel dust and heroin and all that I was on it
My opponent never knew what hit him
As I was bootin' I heard him say ""Get down somebody's shootin'""
He didn't realize he was the target
I didn't realize what I was doing till he departed
Oh Lord, I'm feeling something I never felt black
I told his momma I was sorry she said ""Sorry won't bring him back""
God gave life to the human race and he alone has the right to take it away
So I tell me that I don't care
But every time I dim the lights I'm havin' motherfuckin' nightmares
It's been a year since I heard dude holler
And I can still smell the motherfuckin' gunpowder
What does life mean to me?
I'd trade places with the man a heartbeat if I was granted peace
I try to wipe it out my memory
I saw a shrink but she couldn't provide a remedy
I'm public enemy number one
Waitin' in line on death row to get the needle for what I done
Pretty soon I meet my maker
Thee creator, the one and only true time taker
Bushwick Bill:
How much more longer I got life left
You don't know that's why I live day for day and time it right and left
And try to take two steps at a time
Makin' sure our opposition stays two steps behind
Keep in mind these niggas who wanna see me lettin' go and shit
That's why I fight for my life until it's over with
I know these niggas havin' hard times
That's why I'm standing up and fighting for shit when it reguards mines
Why must I always sing these sad songs
Because they comforance all my feelings inside till all the bad's gone
You wanna hear my life story well I told ya
Maybe there's answers to my question in you fuckin' folder
What's the solution to this mind state?

Ain’t With Being Broke,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"""Better to have money and not to need it;
Than to need it and not to have it!""

Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some

Lemonheads don't quote, I ain't with bein broke
I'm tired of my mother bustin ass for other folks
Gettin nowhere fast
While the ho on the corner makin mo' money sellin ass!
I ain't with this outfit
I gotta make some moves to buy G Jones some nice shit
Before she kill herself, workin on a job all week
That don't even make the fuckin ends meet
I walk down Main Street
Growls in my stomach cause I ain't had nuttin to eat
So how the fuck am I gon' thank?
When I'm in a funky sweatsuit and see a bitch in a mink
Her ass is tooken out puttin non-stop
Make the swap and go shop
I said that to say this and every note
I ain't with being broke!

Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
Got to get my hands on some
Money, more money
Got to get my hands on some

I was BORN in a cheap-ass hospital
Brought to 5th Ward, stuffed right in the middle
Of a rock and a hard spot
Before my dad got that ass I was already counted out
What a motherfuckin pity
Momma couldn't afford milk so we had to suck her titty
In the kitchen every night I would see
Rats and roaches eatin better than me
There was no Thanksgiving
They say I'm a fool for thanking God for living
But bein broke ain't no motherfuckin joke
Well out in '91 shit just ain't happenin bro
I never had a God damn thing
Christmas came and went, without a choo-choo train
In the ghettos gifts get stole or bought
Ain't no motherfuckin Santa Claus!

Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some, sweet mo-neyyyy
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some

Let the gunshots RANG OUT, blow my God damn BRAINS OUT
If you've been there, you know what I'm talkin about
Gettin over tops my agenda
The easy way out, is to jump out of a window
But that's a dopefiend move gone left
I'll kill you, but not MYSELF
I tried to do the right things major
But that didn't put no food on the table
Went back to school to get my G.E.D
But who's gonna hire a motherfucker like me?
... McDonald's don't fit
They work you like a dog plus they talk too much shit!
Without them dollar signs
It's like livin and dyin at the same time
And you wonder why a motherfucker sell dope?
He ain't with being broke!

Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some, yeahhhh
Money, more money (I AIN'T WITH BEING BROKE!)
I've got to get my hands on some, sweet sweet

Money - yeahhhh, money - yeahh
Talkin 'bout money
Yeahhh money
Talkin 'bout that mean green
Talkin 'bout that money

We need money.. {*fades out*}",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-aint-with-being-broke-lyrics
I Tried,The Foundation,2005,"She don't wanna be with me no mo'
Ain't her fault she just tired of this dumb shit that she don't know
Whether to throw in the towel or if he gon' grow
And if he do, where is he gon' go?
Got a letter from an old friend, I read it and cried
When he told me that his girl just died
Right out of the blue, breast cancer, wasn't nothin' to do
Now I'm sittin' here and thinking of you
Tryin' to come to amends, 'cause really I don't want it to end
You the only one I trust as a friend
I know I'm on my last leg limpin' with this bullshit written
But I still gotta bring it to light
Spent half of a lifetime missin' cause I would not listen
Confused about my wrong and my rights
They tellin' me that time heals wounds though
This wound gon' need some stitches; I got testimony for niggas
You doin' what you do but when the shoe gets flipped
Standin' on the other foot got your boots and shit
When you back up and analyze, fix shit and finalize
Before you leave the shit alone just try
Maybe there's somethin' you can do to rectify what's did
And plus you gotta think of the kids
That's kinda just the way life is, you either gotta live or you die
At least that I can say that I tried

'Cause I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good enough
'Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin' by yourself mixed up
But I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good enough
'Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin' by yourself mixed up, but I tried

Faster than a crackhead can pawn yo' shit
Willie D'll put a foot in you bitch
I sold dope, robbed folks, had to make ends meet
Since fifth grade, I been up in these streets, tryin to get it
Raised by a single mother, two sisters, two brothers
I used to think she didn't love us
'Cause she beat us so much, plus she came home drunk
But every now and then she'd knock on wood, and say
I tried to do the best that I could and I believe her
'Cause she was treated evil out the box
You can't get what you ain't got
Momma I was young, hittin' licks, started helpin' you out
'Bout the closest that you came to a man of the house
I was talkin' back, walkin' through the do' gettin' smacked
You used to brag to your friends on how well I rapped
We never really got along but when you took sick
I was at your side 'til you died
I wasn't the best son but I tried

'Cause I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good enough
'Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin' by yourself mixed up
But I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good enough
'Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin' by yourself mixed up, but I tried

I've always been a crook, never given up
But the past few years has been really rough
Felt like givin' up a couple of times
Take a jump or plant a slug deep, up in my mind
Fuck it I'm dyin', done wit strugglin' for mine
Sleepin' on fans' floors, ain't no use to me lying
Change my name for anonymity's sake
But a four feet dwarf that be on television's hard to miss
I get pissed over little shit, little shit drive me crazy
Then I start thinkin' 'bout my babies
I can't go to jail, I can't die
Who better to teach 'em 'bout this cruel world than I?
Their mommas won't let me see 'em, I still pay my support
'Cause once you give life, life is bigger than yours
Maybe I'm not all you expect me to be
But when it's done and said ultimately, daddy tried

'Cause I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good enough
'Cause when it's over, said shit done
You sittin' by yourself mixed up
But I tried, I tried to do the best I could
Sometimes I guess my best ain't good enough
'Cause when it's over, said shit done

Damn, why don't you put some fuckin drums in the music
So I can
Get down to business
I think it's time I paid a little visit
To my run down neighborhood cemetery
To tally up the people I buried
57, 58, 59, All layin' down in the same line
You sorry motherfuckers couldn't handle me
I done fucked up 17 families
So bring it on if you wanna play
Huh, make my motherfuckin' day
'Cause you'll be one dead motherfucker black
I'ma put your ass on you back
I won't play no games wit'cha boy
You'll just be one more nigga in the morgue
Yeah I like that man
That shit sounds kinda funky, don't it
Hahahaha, yo let me finish this freestyle tho man
Hold 'em down, hold 'em up, yo
It's gonna be a killin' after midnight
Niggas gettin' ready for a big fight
You could say this one's a murder by a lunatic
Hear me livin' on your ass bitch
Loadin' up my weapons gettin' ready for
Another street sweepin' neighborhood drug war
Police come around in a meat wagon
Knowin' that tonight they'll be draggin'
Off motherfuckers to a six-foot ditch
I hope ya insurance paid up bitch
'Cause tonight is the night motherfucker
Be a good killer or a damn good ducker
'Cause if you ain't, your ass is fallin' to the paint
Bloodshed seems to make a nigga faint
Not me with a .9 in my hand
I could fall asleep lyin' next to a dead man
Ya gotta understand me
It's been a vet sorry motherfucka layin' out dead see
So if you wanna come, come hard
Or you'll just be another nigga in the morgue
Yeah, you motherfuckas
Motherfuckas goin' for bad and shit
You know what I'm sayin'
But you'll be another niger in the morgue motherfucker
Oh yo, check this out
But gettin' back to the bloodbath
You motherfuckas out there go for bad
That shit played out my brother
I ride by and gun down motherfuckers
Whether friend or foe bro
Steppin' on my toes, your ass has gotta go
Now here's how the shit took place 
A nigga waved a trey eight in my face 
Screamin' that shit about the Squab Mob
Talkin' big shit about the South Park
Said he's gonna stop me
Pissed off cause I'm down with the 5th Ward posse 
Shit didn't make me numb
I ain't scared of no goddamn gun 
Once I saw 'em break I stuck 'em 
Fuck 'em!
I'll put him on his ass cause he's bigger
Then worry about the other 3 niggas
All of them ran to get backup
That's 12 more bodies I'ma stack up
Open up the trunk in a rage
And loaded up my goddamn 12 gauge
If the punk don't keep ya
I'll be forced to hit ya with the street sweeper
Ya ass shouldn't a started no static g
12 gunshots automatically
I ain't goin' out like no sucka
I'm goin' out like a crazy motherfucka
Everybody knows that I ain't got it all
And I don't give a fuck about none of y'all
Hit 3 or 4 in the head
That's 3 or 4 niggas left for dead
It doesn't pay to check cards

And underline all y'all downfalls for ya
Catch you fuckin' up and bring the pound down on ya
Infect your neighbborhood with this drug called hate
Ish out your income and control y'all fate
Provide you motherfuckers with this shit that look cool
And price it outta range to keep your ass outta school
You don't work you don't eat you don't eat you don't sleep
And then I got your ass apon these motherfuckin' streets
Poising your own breed turning you from Jesus
Get you out your faith and hit your ass with diseases
And now you can't reproduce there goes your children
Don't worry about you dying slow I'm a get to killin'
And shot up your motherfuckin' dreams fromt he jump
And hold you in the penitentiary like a punk
But you can't do shit unless a motherfucker tell ya
You ain't a motherfuckin' man, nigga, yous a failure
You wonder why I hate cha and I paint this picture?
Cause the government is fucked up and I ain't that nigga

Like they did when I was ten
I'm goin' through the same shit that my daddy went through when he was 22
Now who, the fuck to blame for the condition that we in
Pursue the game or end up back up off my shit again
It's kind of easy how we make your choice
We go to ghetto tactic labratorites providing ?
Well anyways that's how I seen it then
But now I realize white collar criminals had to bring it in
And now I go against my own kind
With the mentallity that these niggas been after me a long time

But if you caught up you outta here
And then you wonder what we learned while we've been trapped here
We figured out how to adapt here

Why you rushin?

Jumped in the vehicle, and you know what happened next G

She started makin noises, and then the heavy breathin
I started suckin her titties and rubbin the pussy
Easy, hehehehehe, yeah! But anyway
She was more like beggin, and pleadin for the fuckin
Unzipped my trousers, and then started suckin
Had me sayin shit, I grabbed her by the sweater
She wants to lick my booty, I guess I betta let her
Once I came I didn't want the bitch to kiss me
Thought I wanted a long one but I only wanted a quickie
HA HAHAHAHAHA, word!! Yeah

Drove her back home, she was lookin kinda frantic
I gave the bitch some dick, I couldn't understand it
Hey yo what's the problem?
I ain't even cum; I shoulda stayed home
Yeah, but I'da still got me some
Where's your clip, get your shit and go
She looked me in my eyes, shook her head and said
NO~!
She'da killed me if I didn't fuck her right
So I got on that ass and fucked the pussy all night
She was cumin hectic, two nuts at a time
It really didn't matter, cause man this bitch was fine
She was slippin off the seats so I caught her
The girl had the lips that made me wanna fuck her harder
Grabbed me by my hand, she was moanin BRAD
Opened up some more, and fucked her in the ass
The bitch was gettin married, but all that's fine
I gave the girl a fuckin that would last a lifetime
Oooh when I get home my girl is gonna get me

Give a smile in the mean watch out
This dick is for you

I, bitch I just want to fuck you
Dick, sucked the whole night through
Ass, licked as if I was a star
This dick is for you baby; wherever you are, hey

Bitches I scoop them up like jacks
Stack them like racks and send them home with their pussy off tracks
Cause they be figuring me to be a light weight
But if it gets 'em into the bed, then that's OK
Cause when I get them, I'm doin damage to that pussy hole
Not only do I fuck the body, but I fuck the soul
What other nigga do you know that can handle this
Hijack the pussy from the back and dismantle it
It sounds kind of difficult, but it ain't
The only difficulty that occurs is when the pussy's stank
Cause then I'm a have to send you home and throw you in a ditch
Or leave you for the garbage man you unsanitary bitch
So spread your legs wide open boo
And let a nigga like me get down, cause this dick is for you

I, bitch I just want to fuck you
Dick, sucked the whole night through
Ass, licked as if I was a star
This dick is for you baby; wherever you are, hey

Bitches say I talk bad cause I'm real
And to me expressin myselfis tellin a bitch just how I feel
I had a couple of women in my life but yo
In 1992 I realized that they was hoes
Cause hoes will straight up do ho shit
Bitches even more shit
And ladies will give you no shit
So I kicked back and played the hand that I was dealt
Peep game in the mix, and let these hookers play themself
Cause 80 percent of the bitches I meet ain't shit but money bandits
I front like I'm giving up bank
Stick dick in they ass, and leave 'em stranded
But for women, I got a better tactic cause I love them
They come to Mr. Brad cause their mistreated by their husbands
So I hook up shit to make it right
Just call me tonight
And I'll make sure that everything runs tight
Cause if he don't appreciate you boo
The way that I do
You need to let him run back to his crew
Cause he don't understand what you goin through
But regardless to who I screw
This dick is for you

I, bitch I just want to fuck you

Broker than a motherfucker, bitch! starts to front
Running around high capping like a jerk
You and that big eyed bitch in that mini-skirts
So don't look around like you're having the clue
Little nasty-ass freak, Fuck! you
D, gave me the scoop on you tramp
Your man is a Dope Fiend, buy crack with your Food Stamps
Though he played the role of a soldier
The nigga is a cracker jack, gets knock of the Toldjah
Screaming and screaming about the things that he done for you
You was a lying motherfucker, and you know too
Telling all your friends the nigga is rich
Boy, I can't stand no lying-ass bitch
You need to grow up and put yourself on that other level
Talking loud as fuck, now bitch, what you're trying to settle?
Swearing up and down that he is needing ya
I bet in a week, his sorry-ass will be leaving ya
Although I was through, this is far from the last
I'ma jump off the hearse, and back on your scandalous ass
Now think way back in the days, in the gutter
You, your mother, and your tricky-ass brother

You goddamn parents are tripping
Give me some of that shit you been sniffing
You don't want your kids to hear songs of this nature
But you take em to the movies to watch Schwarzenegger
Fuck that 'Land of Opportunity' shit
I don't need permission to sell a damn hit
I say what I want, when I want, how I want
Try to stop me, get your fucking ass stomped
Call me a bad guy, but in reality
Most you motherfuckers curse worse than me
You rather not show it, you goddamn hypocrite
I ain't hiding shit, so suck my dick
You can't stop this cause the underground is creek
Fuck that shit you preach every week
You contradict yourself in every phrase
Do you know a stupid motherfucker that's always

I'm fixing to get me a Benz next month
I got the money for it right now
But I'm waiting on Rico to bring me this key, you know what I'm saying?

Nigga, do I look like a goddamn sucker?
You say you're clocking, you was a lying motherfucker
Kicking that shit about you're waiting to scope
But every time I see your ass you're waiting on Metro
I can't stand a lying-ass nigga
Try to be hard, but you're sweeter than sugar
Told the boys, you shot a cop to death
But motherfucker, you was locked down for auto theft
Say you ran shit, what you had to drink?
Nigga, you was on a goddamn punk tank
Washing out another nigga's drawers
And getting fucked up your dew-do walls
So don't give me that bullshit story
Pussy motherfucker, I heard they took your commissary
What the fuck are you, a man or a mouse? (Man?)
Well, why the fuck you clean another nigga's house?
Whore-ass nigga, yeah the word got back
I would not busted your ass, but you tried to high-cap
You're like Pinocchio, can't get a lie straight
Say you're scoring keys when you're fucking with eights
Boy you're

Talking loud, saying nothing, yeah
Hey Silly Willy, let me talk, let me say something
Let me say something, let me talk
Talking loud, saying nothing, yeah
 What the fuck you're doing talking to that nigga?
 Aw boy, I - I went to school with him, that's my friend!

Whore, shut up, you're pissing me off
I'm about to bust you in your goddamn mouth
Have you forgotten my description?
I'm a Geto Boy (We can't stand lying bitches)
Whore, you got a head like a goddamn rock
Is your motherfucking brain robbed?
Just the other day, I had a heartfelt blow
And I had to beep you, just to find you whore
Another thing I dislike, is your funky-ass friends
Bitch, who you're fucking, me or them?
You're with the whores all afternoon
And when it's time for me, all your time is consumed
But fuck that shit, take off my ring and my flack
And you owe me 2-50 for the goddamn contacts
You say you love me, but you keep fucking up
Dumb bitch, you ain't doing nothing but

Talking loud, saying nothing, yeah

When it get gangsta - will these motherfuckers ride or die
When it get gangsta, yeah
Bitch nigga you ain't no soldier, you gon' hide and cry

Well let me tell you a lil' somethin 'bout the niggas I roll with
We chin check bitches, we don't go for that ho shit
Come to the Bloody Nickel tryin to stunt
Fifty thou' say I knock yo' ass out with one punch
And I don't care how many gangsta rap songs you listen to
Or the fact you smoke weed and pack a gun, I see the bitch in you
I ain't just {?} shells, be sparkin the marks
I put a clip in you like it's a walk in the park
You can try to make bond, but I'mma stick to the script
Hit you with the pistol grip and make your L-dog flip
Youse a punk, youse a bitch, I'll say it to your face
Youse a punk youse a bitch that testified for the state
All them cowards watchin your back, just don't matter
All I gotta do is clap one and the rest gon' scatter
You click on easy targets and cats who don't bust back
Niggas thinkin y'all the real but tell me this

When it get gangsta - is your niggas gonna fight or run?
When it get gangsta, yeah
The niggas that be bumpin they be tuckin they tongue
When it get gangsta - will these motherfuckers ride or die

Bitch nigga you ain't no soldier, you gon' hide and cry

Pussies fabricated, I'm made, you hoes made up
I speak like I live it doggie, you hoes hate us
I cook and rock it cause all you hoes cake up
I'm ridin on all of you stupid hoes, pay up
What's all this wolfin niggas is barkin, come fuck with me fool
And I'mma put a hole inside yo' ass with this tool
Seven shots, niggas is gutter, we get in yo' shit
Talkin greasy like you runnin somethin, squeezin your dick
What is you itchy, what's really nigga? Call from the block
Loud talkin like you scared niggas, boy youse a mark
You know real niggas move quiet and quick to do dirt
Put this pistol up against your jersey, squeeze it and skirt
Murder be dirty {?} but that's in the plan
And here's somethin that you can't understand
How I can just up and five-finger kill me a man
This game right here for real, you niggas playin, but


Niggas always tell me how real I sound when I flow
That's cause the shit I talk about, I done done it befo'
Other rappers mouth off, that's just protection talk
I done robbed, sold dope, squeezed and left 'em in chalk
Yeah, them hard styles ain't about nuttin cocksucker
Lookin mean ain't never killed a motherfucker
So what you been to the pen and they call you a killer
I still draw this Desert E and spit at you nigga
My mind is made up, just balls and my word
Any bastard that fucked with mine gon' get scurred
Keep thinkin I'm playin, keep thinkin I'm kiddin
I'll bust yo' motherfuckin head wide open like a watermelon
Homeboy 'bout to get his ass whupped blue
And he gon' probably sue, cause that's what pussies do
Some say it ain't worth it but fuck that shit
I'd rather die like a soldier than to live like a bitch

The Other Level,We Can’t Be Stopped,1991.0,"And fuckin two of the finest bitches around G;
It used to be fun, but now it's gettin borin to me
Constantly fuckin, fuckin, fuckin, fuckin
Ridin my dick like a horse, buckin, buckin
Now I'm gettin that enlightenment, in my life
I'm missin that excitement
Thinkin about, how these two girls could excite me
Then it hit me -- both of them liked me
Huh, HAHA, yeah that's the lick
Listen and learn, while I kick some more serious shit
..
Diggin deep into my mind, you understand
I came up with a dope-ass master plan
Thinkin while I sip on a 40
I got it! I'mma throw myself a private party
I called up one, and said, ""Whassup?
What's goin on?"" She said, ""Nuthin much""
I said, ""Hey, I got a very close friend, who wants to meet cha
She thinks you're pretty, and from what I told her, she too""
She thought about it and said, ""Cool, it's on""
Pick me up at eight -- then I hung up the phone
I called up the other, dropped a little know-how
Kicked it to her smoooooth, that other level style
Then I dropped the second step of my plan
Asked her had she ever been with two men, or a woman and man?
(""Say what?"") It's just a question, I'm not out to diss you
She said, ""Yeah baby it's cool, but yo, I'm heterosexual""
She was frontin man, trust me
Cause she's the type of ho who like to taste her own pussy
When we're fuckin she takes the dick out, licks it all over
Then she puts it in her mouth
Now after doin that type of shit
She could be talkin the other things REAL quick
I said, ""I got another friend, I wanna party with
And we can all get into the hot tub and have a little bit of fun
You know baby? Hahaha!
Consider this a test and if you pass you'll be my number one""
She said, ""Okay it's a date
I gotta make a few runs, so pick me up at eight""
""Huh, better make it eight thirty! Give me some time to wash up
And take a bath because I'm kinda dirty""
Before she hung up the phone, I said, ""Wait!
If you wasn't special to me, I wouldn'ta invited you on the date""
She said, ""Yeah, I know - I love you see you later""
Things are gettin good but in the end they'll be much greater
..
Pick em up, then I make em feel comfortable
Crackin jokes, as if I was Cliff Huxtable
Get into the crib, things are hype
Fix em a couple of drinks, to get their heads right
But not too much cause I don't wanna make em woozy
Thirty minutes later, let's jump into the jacuzzi
One said, ""I didn't even bring a swimsuit""
The other said, ""Don't worry about it - ain't nobody gonna bite you;
Cause I don't have one either..""
The shit was gettin dope! I had to take a breather
Step into the water and it's showtime
I'm a nigga -- so I GOTS to go for mine
But the key's to have patience
But with two of the finest girls in the world, who wouldn't be anxious?
But I kept my cool, grinnin like a devil
Know I'm bout to put these two bitches on that other level
Hayeah yeah yeah, I'm just your typical horny little devil
..
I make them both suck on my chest like Mr. Slick
Then I took one's head, and pushed it down to the dick
Now I got one on the dick, one on the nipples
Squeezin on they asses, the shit is so simple!
Then another smooth move real quick
I pushed the other bitch's head down to the dick
Now they're suckin on my dick like a lollipop
In and out of each other's mouth, when will they ever stop?
Oooh! Suckin on my pole; and while they suckin on my pole
I'm runnin my fingers through their pussyholes
Then back up to the chest again - YES!
Everything is cool, cause I'm the best my friend
Now they're lickin on my chest, my nipples rather die
Jimmy pushed both of their heads together
Now they kissin one another - oooh!
Fifty minutes later, they were eatin each other
I got these bitches so much into themselves they forgot about me
And I'm sittin here, butt-motherfuckin-naked G
But after time went by, yo
You know a nigga like me, had to get down for mines
And I shoulda won a fuckin medal
For takin both of these bitches, to the other level

And we representin our god damn selves
Cuz how da fuck
You gona tell me how to get to where I'm goin
When you dont know where da fuck you goin
Man das da blind leadin da muthafuckin blind
I should've been a leader not a follower a coach not a balla
I could've had progress
I could've lived wit less stress
But i took it upon myself and played da card i wuz delt
Thought about my self
Fuck everyone else
And they said fuck me too
But it was cool like that
You see my mission was paper chasin and puttin da hood on da map
Now i've done been there
Done that
Took one step and two back
For da life of me I'm thinking
Wut da fuck wuz i thinkin
Should'v slowed the shit sinkin
But I'm stuck with a code
Niggas wait around to see if i wuz gonna come up befo
But i can't fold like a bitch
And it's too late to switch
But i wuz brought up yo make it
Seen da chance to take it
Find a rule and break it
Locate the badge and shake it
And against all odds
Get da fuck outta dodge
Pop our nigga wit records dat da state can't file
Young, blind, and wild
An uncontrollable child in da ghetto
And I'm settlin fo mo everyday
And when i make up my mind I'm gonna get back in line but now I'm
Chorus 2x
Blind leadin da blind
In a world of wars i search for peace of mind my stabillity
Fo my niggas and me said da way life wuz supposed to be in da ghetto
I looked out my window wut did i see
It wuz a crack head nigga starin dead at me
He said can i get a muthafuckin nickle for three
I told his ass to da better in his rorock swetta
He got a daughter he ain't fed her
He'd rather get high
In his eye i see da demon
I can hear babies screamin
Feenin
It demeaning to see him
To be in the ghetto
But this is where i settle
Now wut would you do wit a strap in yo hand
Gangstas do wut dey wunt to
Suckas do wut dey can
My role modle sips on a forty botlle
In his footsteps i follow grab da brew and take a swallow
I've been livin on da streets since da age of thirteen
Cuz i wuz sick of being raised by a dope fiend i so seen
Babies need similac money dat wuz meant for similac wuz spent on crack
Now do you wanna..kno why its a liquor store on every cona
And niggas ain't da owna- listen, we can't afford to send our kids to school but dey got da knowledge-
Spend our money with the Japs and they send they kids to college-
Now here we are: hoes, dopes, dealers, and bums
At da white man's table still beggin fo crumbs

Niggas shoot ball
(niggas shoot da logs)
Nigas shoot da doves
(niggas shoot to love)

So wut da fuck am i to do when niggas fallin down like flies
And dis muthafuckin money starin me in da eyes
And my brother sayin come on in stop buggin
But we done already lost 3 uncles and 5 cousins
To da streets niggas shit deep

Saw a nigga dat killed i gotta kill befo deez niggas get sum bright ideals
And start thinkin we hoes or sumthin

Yeah, this is Jay

Hold on, Jay

Hey Jay, long time no hear, man, what's up?

Say man
People been kicking around a lot of hoe shit in my ears

Is that right?

Yeah, it upsets me to hear a World Class Wreckin' Crew-
?Homosexual? disrespect some real soldiers

What time it is then, right?

It's time to mix 5th Ward, South Park and 69th Curbs
And really let a muthafucka know
(Action speaks louder)
(Action speaks louder than words)
(Action speaks louder)

Roll em up and I smoke em
Tried to break, so I broke em
Busted his ass in the head, that's when I grabbed him and choked him
I'm on revenge, a psychopath, the master of wreckin shit
Comes back with a body blow, hittin hard as a fuckin brick
Don't fuck with the mastermind, I'ma tell you like that
Cause I'm the type of nigga that'll still you with a bumper jack
Better yet grab a bat, apart from the pack
Then commence to beat on your head to the muthafuckin fact
I'm ragin like Manson, I'm a muthafuckin thriller
Friday 13th's my birthday, so I was a born killer
Brought up as a trouble kid, devious shit's what I shoulda did
Mom had an abortion with me, but a nigga lived
I don't fear losin life, cause life just lost me
Shadow of death keeps followin me and I can't get him off me
2 years of my life were spent in a mental health
I'm a treath to society, then again to my fuckin self
I'm losin my fuckin mind, my veins begin swellin
'Kill that muthafucka!' I hear voices in my head yellin
Me get caught in a cross, that's absurd
Your head is a tennis ball and I'm about to serve

Bodybags in the bushes, see, I tried to tell em
I just hope pretty soon that somebody smell em
My lyrics get deeper and deeper
Mack 10, 12-guage, Tec-9 plus a Street Sweeper
Nigga, Ganksta NIP's in the house
Time I see a mouse automatic spaghetti sauce
Been poor all my life, so I reach for the sky
I regret I was born, I can't wait till I die
And leave blood on the curtain
Fatal thoughts of death, suicide is certain
I kill for a quarter, lyrics deep as the water
Peace to Rodney King, I got they ass in slaughter
Insane is what I am
I'm like Silence of the muthafuckin Lambs
Ganksta NIP ain't no bragger-boaster
Migraine headaches made me sleep in a toaster
Step in my face, I'll commence the hittin

Down with Seag from the 69th Curbs
Tell em, Triple 6 (action speaks louder than words)

Well, first of all..
I shock em and clock em and pop em and drop em, flop em, then I mop em
In they muthafuckin tracks is where I stop em
Unless you down with a bloody nose
Save the cussin and fussin and pointin fingers for them hoes
Talk is cheap, I catch your ass on the sneak
And hit you everywhere but under your feet
Think it's a game when it ain't
I'm lettin you talk, but bitch, I'll knock yo lips off
And get ready for your kinfolk
Your little sister be the first one to get smoked
Then I grab your grandma by her weave hair
And whip her old ass with that wooden leg she wear
I'm from the bloody 5th and that's it, trick bitch
You don't know who you're fuckin with
I break this 10 1/2 so deep in your ass
That you'll be lookin like a faggot on the rag
I'm goin for bam like Scarface and NIP
What they leave of your ass Willie D gonna rip
All of that muthafuckin talkin is for the birds
I do this ( *shots* ) cause action speaks louder than words

Time to be accounted for the all-words spunk
Counterfeit gangstas, pranksters and chumps
Talkin real loud in front of a crowd, dare ya
I show your punk ass, nigga, better than I can tell ya
Signin checks that your punk ass can't cash
Got your album cover full of punks wearin ski masks
Who ain't never felt froggish, you won't leap
Barkin like a bear and bitin like a flea
Busters, straight suckers, muthafuckas
Donald Goines-readin-ass wanna-be hustlers
It's Seag from Oakland, the one who lays order
Quit lyin to kick it and make a run for the border
Willie D, Bushwick, Scarface and Ganksta NIP
Gave me the tip on the niggas yappin lip
Too Black hooked me, Lil' Jay booked me
Shakin em, breakin em, makin and takin em fakin fuckin rookies
And all that loud shit, nigga, don't start
They'll find your ass chopped and stuffed in a shopping cart
Fools awake and give praise to the dark lord
Bring on the chalice, voodoo dolls and the oujia boards

Here I go again, another brawl, a conflict
Somebody finna get they ass kicked
If you ain't down with the Geto Boys
Get your happy ass outta Dodge
The rumors you heard ain't slander
Willie D don't give a fuck about a goddamn bystander
So when you see me clutch my fist
Get out the way or get t-rolled, bitch
I'm inclined to physically whip your ass
But if you wanna blast
Make a muthafuckin motion like you wanna reach
And you gon' have a damn funeral next week
From the hardest to the softest
For me to beat a nigga down is a day at the office
See, my appearance is so damn fly
It makes em say, ""Hm - he's a nice guy""
So a nigga try to play me like a ho
Oh-oh, oh shit, damn, that's a no-no
I get dead on his ass, so when I'm strikin
He bet no fall, or I'mma make his ass read these Nikes
(Oh my goodness! x2)

You read these Nikes, cause you're fucked up, punk
Here's the definition of gettin your ass stomped
(I'm a nigga insane kickin ass extremely)
So you weak-ass hoes keep dreamin
Bushwick, can I get a witness?
(Fuck yeah, Nyquil that sickness!)
Yeah, and when I form this gesture
Don't call mama, cause the bitch can't help ya
Better yell for a paramedic
Or somethin that nature, cause I'mma try to break ya
Ass into muthafuckin particles
Let's see if I can get you in a newspaper article
To hell with emotions
I don't stop till I cream a muthafucka like lotion
Remorse - what the fuck is that?
I beat your mama ass and go get a six-pack
Gettin mild, I don't play that shit
Fuck havin mercy on a goddamn bitch
Nigga could be yo momma
But if she fucks with me
Her ass is gonna read these Nikes

Yo D, I saw the way you stomped that muthafucka
And left your trademark upside his head

Yeah man, that was one of my off nights
I usually leave the whole muthafuckin logo

I don't give a fuck who you hang with, trick
Friends ain't shit when you're gettin your ass kicked
But if your buddies wanna get in my mix
Chop-chop ( *gunfire* )
 yo, bitch
It ain't nothin but a mere formality
Every sucker muthafucka is a casualty
I kick ass, you want evidence
Look at the bottom of my goddamn shoeprint
From muthafuckas done donated blood to the kid
Now do you wanna make a bid?
I didn't think so, cause I'd have yo
Ass screamin just like a damn ho
When I hit ya in your goddamn mouth
And show you what a real nigga's all about
When I dispose of your ass like waste
And nothin but my shoe is in your muthafuckin face
You're readin these Nikes
Look at you now, muthafucka!
(Oh shit!)
Look at...
(Oh! Aw, hold up, man
Hold up, shit, aw, come on...
Alright, man, alright, I quit, man
I quit, alright - aw shit)
...fuck with me!
(Oh man)

Here's an incident that got me sent to the slammer
I'm at the club rappin to this 
yellowhammer
This bitch was holy, severely cut
So I'm rappin to her, right? To see if she'll fuck
I never asked if she was taken, cause honestly
That type of shit don't matter to me
Just when we was leavin out the goddamn door
Some trick-ass nigga fronted me bout the whore
I let the fool file with a diss or two
But the nigga kept pushin the goddamn issue
So I pulled out the 9mm
And bust his ass in the head, you could see the
Blood gushin out his goddamn skull
He played hisself, now his ass gettin drugged
I was charged with aggravated assault
But before I got off his ass
...I made him read these Nikes

Yo, Flav, I give a fuck about a God damn grammy
But them motherfuckin hoes won't hand me one
At least you was invited by the biggots
The motherfuckers told me to buy a ticket
To the phoney ass ceremony
Fuck Oscar, Emmy and Tony
Cause when it comes to award time
Niggas be standin on the God damn sideline
I'm loadin my nine 'cause I got a lotta grudges
I'm bout to take out the judges
Willie D won't shit cha but hit cha
Take a look at the overall picture
Every year its the same old story
Same faces, same categories
I sold a lotta records and a lotta people know me
Now where's my God damn trophy?

I'm under a microscope, for the songs I wrote
Cause the gangsta of love don't scapegoat
I tell it like it is that's why they don't have me
I ain't tryin to make nobody happy
I'm from the streets so I kick it for the ghetto
I can't talk about shit I don't know
Your whole vocabulary's, ""Baby baby baby""
That's why you so God damn crazy
And it should be a crime
One sucka gets nominated 5 or 6 damn times
It ain't that he's better than the rest
It's just a damn popularity contest
Or a bribe or a favor
Motherfuckers make a speech and they think that they major
I sold a lot of records and a lot of people know me
Now where's my God damn trophy?

So to accept his award on his behalf, we have Grateful Dead""

It ain't what you know, it's who you know bro
That's why I'm not on your radio and your video show
It's gettin kinda hectic
And I still ain't kissin no ass to be accepted
They finally gotta category for rap
But don't blink 'cause you'll miss it in the format
And if you follow my suggestions
9 times outta 10 you see some country western
They need to have Willie D on that stage
Pumpin his fists like this and gettin bliss
With MD-20 20
Or the 40 O-Z wit the rest of the GB
I'm tired of your boring shows
I make your stuck up ass audience say HO!
I sold a lotta records and a lotta people know me
Now where's my God damn trophy

And Guns and...hey what the?""

The nasty ass group award goes out to 2 Live Crew
The High Roller of the industry award goes out to Ice T
The pro-black grammy goes out to Public Enemy

Like my grandmother, she paid her tithe, sold her place and picked up folks
For the church and died broke, with nothin to show


You can talk that hot shit if you want to
But it don't tell me what you won't do

Ain't no excuse for it, go on be a man and admit it
That come from cappin, buyin cars and trickin bitches
I ain't tryin to knock your hustle homey, that ain't cool
But get your money, clean it up, and get the fuck on fool
Cause your friends just wanna stunt and these hoes just want your bread
And the fed is gonna hunt and these niggas'll blow your head
Behind beef, or a fake say, dude knew your face
So you murdered him, but ain't got nothin to show


I'll be God damned if I'mma be that old nigga that live
60 plus years and leave nothin but bills
""Mind Playin Tricks"" still playin on the box
And I'm sittin on the porch in sweats and some mismatched dress socks
Yeah right! Before I go out like a busta
I get all my fuckin guns and kill ALL you motherfuckers
I ain't gon' be that cat that's broke so he blows his brain
I'mma be the one to kill the armored truck driver if anythang
Fuck the fame I want the dough cause when times get drastic
You cain't take a fuckin ego to the bank and cash it
I'm not impressed with your big house and expensive whip
If you can't pay cash you can't afford the shit
They say heaven got what I'm needin, but just in case it don't exist
I'm gettin my flowers while I'm breathin
But ain't gon' be like Sammy Davis and Redd Foxx
When Willie D check up out this bitch he goin out on top

I told you, I was gon' give you somethin to think about
Shit, even if I fuck off all the money I made
Nigga I'mma still God damn be paid at the end
Cause guess what? Got that life insurance policy, hahaha
Shit that motherfucker there's, better than playin the lottery
You guaranteed to hit
Babies they can come up like instant millionaires
I tell you right now my baby's an instant millionaire
Nigga you understand what I'm sayin?
Some of y'all sucka busta ass nigga
Y'all don't understand that kind of shit
Y'all like, worry about the bitch
Spendin the money on this nigga and that nigga and all this shit
Nigga drivin your car, livin in your house
Stop marryin these motherfuckin hoes! You won't have that problem",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-nothin-2-show-lyrics
Gangsta (Put Me Down),"Da Good, Da Bad & Da Ugly",1998.0,"They Love me

They say now pass the ganja to the left hand side
Filpping in the Range Rover blowing past the one times
Hit me with the (whoop whoop)
Bubble gum flashing in my rear view
Spraying freshener trying to steer too
Throwin out my herbs on the passenger side
Got the windows rolled down, airing out the ride
Got a loaded .45 inside
That I keep for protection when I'm riding by
My Smith and Wesson got a scope too
And I may have caught a body on it
For those who get just know somebody want it
They only ?????
To know that you ain't done shit
But still you got them haters in your business
I'm paranoid she's blowing my high
And she knew that I was buzzin from the red in my eye
Got my license and my papers, Showed me my picture on The Source
Then what the fuck you stopping me for?
And she said

Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sta put me down
Now, Ow

So I gave her my cellular number and told her call me up
Beating on my dashboard hot than a fuck
Cause I done chunked a half a square thinking 5-0 jocking trying to jam me up
I continue on my mission to my Grandma's house
Hollering at my homeboy who just got out
What's up let's roll
Get you some clothes
Take you to the club so you can get with some hoes
Lets go
Made to the mall hoes thick
Listenting to Pac screaming that's the shit
Getting geared when this woman appeared up out the blue
Telling me she like what I do
And the ho was like

Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sta put me down
Now, Ow

Willie D's rollin on D's
In a drop top A-Z-U-R-E
With the knock knock banging
Listening to a song my nigga Face singing
Eardrums just a ringing, my homey bringing
A couple of honies to the hideaway
We gone fuck these hoes and straight ride away
Gotta pack confirmed tickets get some sleep
We rolling to the Baby Johnson fight a 100 niggas deep
Ain't bringing sand to beach
I got my eyes on some freak ass broads
And menage-a-trois
Never kiss and tell I keeps em horny as hell
And take my dick inside that pussy put it under a spell
Got more mail than the post office let me remind you
Don't stare at my diamonds too hard they might blind you
Freaky Deeky, Freaky Deeky Deeky
When you see me rolling past all you got to do is ask

Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sta put me down
Now, Ow
Gangsta Ow
Put me Down, Now
Gang-sta put me down

Eye 4 An Eye,"Da Good, Da Bad & Da Ugly",1998.0,"Yeah, yeah
It's fucked up
[Verse 1: Scarface & 
Willie D
]
I got a partner who been gone for eleven flat
And I ain't seen him since he been gone, imagine that
A young nigga in the hood I grew up in
Fightin' a battle in the system that no one wins
And all these niggas go for bad when they lose friends
Gettin' impossible to tie up all the loose ends
My homeboy lost his sista in a car wreck
He's still alive but through her eyes he done saw her death
And when he came, he was violent (violent)
And when he left, she was silent (silent)
No other way left to describe it
You tellin' niggas keep they heads up, you fool you
When they killin' niggas like they used to
And ain't no-mothafuckin-body fightin' back
Pretty soon they gon be hangin blacks
 (why?)
'Cause niggas won't react, we take an eye for an eye
And a tooth for tooth do them bitches like they do us
Cock it back and shoot

Lock and load, standin' at the end of the road
Glocks explode, you mothafuckas reap what you sow
Lock the doors, ain't nobody leavin' alive
At the end of the line, we gotta die
That's why we're take an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth
Do them bitches like they do us, cock it back and shoot
Lock and load, standin' at the end of the road
Rob and loot, you ride for me I ride for you

And when you pop them mothafuckas
You pop them bitches till they stop bleeding
I'm coming through and my Glock leadin'
(And they stop breathin')
You tell his mothafuckin mama ""stop grievin'""
Cause we're not leavin'
Until she know how to feels to lose a loved one
Mothafuck a redneck race
(Fuck that nigga, let's slug one nigga)
Tie that bitch by his ankles to the back of a truck
Drag his ass till his body parts rip the fuck up

Lock and load, standin' at the end of the road
Glocks explode, you mothafuckas reap what you sow
Lock the doors, ain't nobody leavin' alive
At the end of the line, we gotta die
That's why I'm keepin' my peace of mind
Poverty structured to destroy
Everything that it touches
Leavin' niggas on crutches
And the whole neighborhood in pain
We bow our heads and continue to pray

Lock and load, standin' at the end of the road
Glocks explode, you mothafuckas reap what you sow
Lock the doors, ain't nobody leavin' alive
At the end of the line, we gotta die
That's why we're take an eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth
Do them bitches like they do us, cock it back and shoot
Lock and load, standin' at the end of the road
Rob and loot, you ride for me I ride for you

You disrespect our community when you come around
Then enlist the black ministers to calm us down
Bitch, fuck peace and the police
Until the bullshit cease, it's a war in the belly of the beast
A Nat Turner-Learner
I keep my finger on the fuckin' trigga
I ain't scared like these other niggas
Black life being lost to you cannibal types
While you're fightin' over animal rights, you cannibal whites
Decapitate 'em like they did dude
And let em rot in the woods
Leave 'em sittin' there for bird food
It's cold-blooded
'Cause we can't get a fair shot
We're gettin' 20 years for dime rocks
Three strikes, that's shit for niggas and the vatos
Not for the crackas up in Pine Oaks, and I hope (I hope)
Eventually, we'll overcome it
But ain't no motherfuckin' singin'
You wantin' drama? We can bring it

Look I'ma say this shit one time and one time only
We ain't against all white people
But we are against all white people that's against us
Fuck all you motherfuckers!

Fuck your jail cells
Fuck your mangy-ass dogs
Fuck your chewing tobacco
Fuck your confederate flag
And fuck your militias, your shotguns in the back of your pickups
You cow-herdin', sheep-fuckin', horseback-ridin'
Barefoot-walkin', tractor-drivin', trailer-park
Cousin-fuckin, nigga-jew-hatin
Redneck racist (you mothafucka)
You mothafuckas are unbelievable
Y'all talkin' all that shit about ""go back to Africa""
You weren't talkin' all that shit when we was out there in them fields sweatin'
Pickin' that cotton for y'all mothafuckin' asses
We built this mothafucka
We deserve just as much if not more prosperity than you hoes do
Angry white man, who the fuck you angry with?
You should be angry with your mothafuckin' self
Because we don't own corporate America
Y'all do
Corporate America is 70 percent white male Anglo Saxon
Y'all run the motherfucker, y'all took the job overseas
You wanna be mad at somebody, be mad at your goddamned self
But if you wanna get it on we can get it on mothafucka
Till the break of dawn you understand what I'm sayin'
You want a race war? You got it
I ain't scared of you motherfuckers",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-eye-4-an-eye-lyrics
It Ain’t,Till Death Do Us Part,1993.0,"Niggas hangin' deep on the cut
Sippin' on a motherfuckin' 40 ounce of Gooden
Ain't shit changed in my hood since '86
In 1987 I was swore into the clique
All the triflin' bitches in my hood smoked moes
And all the real gangsta ass niggas rode vogues
Drop Monty Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups
Firin' up fry flaggin' hoes out the roof
Car down crush bustin' fresh paint
Eight in the back you hear my Alpine crank
All of my niggas they had a truck load of dope
Cause back in the gang you can get it by the boat
It's 1993 new bounds are being broken
If you ain't bangin' then you gots to be smokin'
Cause I remember back when the nigga had green
Seen him at the pipes and now the nigga is just a dope fiend
Funny how a nigga, sold a key or two
Is down on his ass and all of a sudden he remember you
Everythings cool I'm the niggas man
Reachin' out his arm tryin' to shake a nigga hand
But I just walked away and left his shit to hang
Cause back in the game I had a motherfuckin' thang
And that's why I walk with my hands on my dick
A nigga say ""What's up?""
I look around and I say ""This!""
And I could give a fuck if the nigga gets pissed
Cause if he wants a chunk I'm a get up in his shit

Like it ain't shit
I thought you knew
It ain't shit

Creepin' comin' up a yellow stonin'
Put my shit in park and drunk a St. Ises with my homey
Reminisced on fast times past times and shit
Smokin' on some bud I came across my nigga Kick
I gave my boy some dap and asked him what's the haps
Chillin' with this girl and a gat across his laps
I knew he had some drama I didn't even have to ask it
Now where were them bitches at it's time to kick some asses
He told what had happened and now I'm thinkin' ""fuck""
I'm callin' up South Acres it's time to get 'em up
My motherfuckin' neighbourhood is quick to get with static
Never showin' fear cause these niggas never had it
Everybody's trapped, quick to go to war
Quick to kill your ass quick to jack your car
So if you see some shit then I suggest you punch it
Cause what's about to happen you may not be able to stomach
Killers killers killers steady smokin' fry
So nigga lay it down or die motherfuckers die
Fuckin' with my family you dick is in the paint
So don't think that it's shit cause niggero it ain't
Shit to break 'em off I'm breakin' 'em off with chunks
Siggedy south iggedy acres ain't no motherfuckin' punks
And drive-by shootin' ain't the motherfuckin' shit
Cause niggas plot hits after motherfuckin' hits
Killin' you ass for kicks doin' shit for the murder
And since you want me to die you gots to die cause you deserve ta
Now here take this motherfuckin' slug (bang)
Cause fuckin' with the kid is the grounds of being drugged
Mister mister Face the hardest nigga being heard
Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word
I'm sick of motherfuckers thinkin' they run shit
Until you face to face wiith Scarface you ain't done shit
I'm killin' off you mark ass niggas with a slug from a Glock motherfuckers
I'm a born killer, I really thought you knew bitch
I'm slappin' hoes and cappin' fools
It ain't shit",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-it-aint-lyrics
Mind of a Lunatic (LP version),Grip It! On That Other Level,1989,"Paranoid, sitting in a deep sweat
Thinking - I gotta fuck somebody before the week ends
The sight of blood excites me, shoot you in the head
Sit down, and watch you bleed to death
I hear the sound of your last breath
Shouldn't have been around, I went all the way left
You was in the right place for me at the wrong time
I'm a psychopath, in a minute lose my fucking mind
Calm down, back to reality
Don't fear death, 'cause I know that it's promised to me
Flashes, I get flashes of Jason
Gimme a knife, a million lives I'm wastin'
The shadow of death follows Bill, I don't give a fuck
Pussy play Superman, your ass'll get boxed up
Put him in a straight jacket, the man's sick
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

Looking through her window, now my body is warm
She's naked, and I'm a peeping tom
Her body's beautiful, so I'm thinking rape
Shouldn't have had her curtains open, so that's her fate
Leaving out her house, grabbed the bitch by her mouth
Drug her back in, slammed her down on the couch
Whipped out my knife, said, ""If you scream, I'm cuttin'""
Opened her legs and commenced the fuckin'
She begged in a low voice ""Please don't kill me""
I slit her throat and watch her shake like on TV
Now there's a witness, all in my business
Sitting with a bloody body next to me I'm nervous
Now the time has come for me to make a decision
Should I live in reality? Or live in the television?
Here come the cops, will they blow me to bits?
This is what goes on in the mind of a lunatic

I'm going insane! I can't keep it quiet
The mind of a lunatic, considered psychotic
Scarface of the 90s y'all, so don't even try it
Don't fuck with me boy, cause I'm no Karais
I'm game for an outbreak, if you wanna break
It's just another motherfucker's life that I take
D'Ak's on the violent tip, ain't takin no shit
And if you think Imma quit, then bitch come equipped
'Cause I'mma get down for mine, just like a G-O
This ain't the fuckin' circus, stop clownin' me ho
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No tellin' what's being thought of, in the mind of a lunatic
My boy's getting skinny, they tell me he smokes
So I thrashed his apartment, and took money's dope
They told him I done it, he caught up with me fast
Acted like he had squabbin' and so I whipped on his ass
He reached for his pistol, and called on his crew
I shot up his posse and put a hole in him too
All comes the deputies and the sheriffs and shit
Prejudiced bastards, suck my dick
I said ""Die motherfuckers!"" as I blasted
Something clicked in my head, visions of bodies in plastic
The scents of buckshots in human flesh
Niggas dying from bullet wounds to the chest
No sheriff's gonna take me on a road
Dark as fuck, and let his pistols explode
Fuck that 'cause I ain'ts to die
So I reloaded my Uzi and fired up another fry
It got me crazy as fuck
A raging psychotic full of that angel's dust
The cops had the place surrounded
Hunted for a way to get out - I found it
Innocent bystanders watching; set an example
I popped one, ""Let me go, goddammit, scot-free
Or all of these mother fuckers coming with me""
All of a sudden the shit got silent
I remember waking up in an asylum
Being treated like a troubled kid
My shirt was all bloody, and both of my wrists was slit
Think this is harsh? This ain't as harsh as it gets
No telling what's being thought of in the mind of a lunatic

November 1st, 1966
A young nigga was born with the mind of a lunatic
I should of been killed
But sister fucked around and let me live
Now I'm a threat to society
Every-motherfuckin-body and their momma trying to quiet me
I'm telling you I'm straight out the nickel
And we ain't got ass lickers, just ass kickers
I'll whoop a punk in a minute
And hope to god that his gal get in it
The first time I see her jumping
I'mma drop kick the bitch like she stole something
Ya weak hoes might say I'm sick
But for real niggas know I tolerate no bullshit
You wanna know what makes me click?
My psychiatrist said I got the mind of a lunatic

I ain't got it all, so don't fuck with me
Unless your ass wanna be made history
I'll blow your motherfucking house up
And if your wife and kids are inside, they're fucked
I don't give a damn who I slay
Don't let me get a hold to some E&J
'Cause when the shit hit the fan
I'll stab your ass quicker than a Mexican
The nightmares I leave you with on the scene
Will make Freddy bitch ass look like a wet dream
This is fact, not fictional, son of a bitch
I got the mind of a lunatic",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-mind-of-a-lunatic-lp-version-lyrics
Geto Fantasy,The Resurrection,1996.0,"I used to watch T.V and see the superstars
Three story mansions and fancy cars
Now picture that a Geto Boy walking that life G
Coming up in a house full of negativity
Everybody drinking everybody smoking
Everybody cussin' and fussin' like hell I'm hopin'
That I can raise up outta this mess
I'm too damn young to be distressed and oh yes
I went and got what I thought was mine
Did the crime the time and a mother fucker didn't whine
But fuck that shit the jailhouse ain't for me
I got places to go and people to see
Wanna make millions and live to see my grandchildren
That's the mother fucking dream that I'm building
Anybody ain't with that can step the fuck back
It's 41 for the poor one never cries
I used to dream about getting that cash
And buy my mamma a crib and I did before she passed
The good life has no equivalent
It ain't a fantasy no more because I'm living it
(Chorus x 2)
Geto fantasies
I don't live here any more
Oh no no no geto fantasy
He said he'd open opportunities
But to me ain't no open opportunities
So shut your Mickey D's down in my communities
Cos it ain't helping feed me or my family
And that's the reala
And you can give a twelve gauge to a nigga
Ain't got scrilla
And now you got a born killer
Cap peela
And while you build your penitentiaries for my children
I plant seeds for my children
So when they cross these roads you'll be prepared
And never show no respect to these hoes that never cared for
Plus they only come around to the black folks
When they run they campaign and they lack votes
Once you vote em in they don't know
Once you vote em in they can't do jack for you
I guess it's true when they tell me you don't fight fair
You turn my ghetto fantasy into a nightmare
(Chorus x 2)
Geto days keep ghetto thoughts relevant
But geto ways make murder imprevalent
You feel me?
I been through many geto episodes all the same
When will niggas learn to use they mind and maintain
See you're always on the defense
Relying on your street sense
I told you once to use them sense to make dollars
Not to make a mother holler
That hard shit's kind a hard to swallow
Tomorrow there'll be more killings in the hood
From child abuse to drug dealings it ain't good
They want to see us stuck
Shit out of luck
Can't nobody ever say I didn't try to give a fuck
Cos I did and I do
The rest is up to you
No matter what you do to your hood stay true
And you'll make it
Can't nobody take it
Geto fantasies become realities if you don't let em shake it

The Secret,The Foundation,2005,"You know what?
I'm destined to be the last man standing
Carefully mapping my escape through planning
Come in and get it, and leave here with it
Making for sure that I'll be free when I hit
It's like a dope man's lotto, the dope man follows
The rule here is simple, and this is my motto
To get it how you get it homie, Murcielago
Get you a house built, keep you a dollar, know
'Cause when it's over it's over, no cheese to borrow
You fuck around, get indicted, ain't no tomorrows
My homie locked up, been six years tight
But six years is nothing, 'cause this kid's life
Is off is a cage, for the rest of his days
A price that he paid, for the mistake he made
So I'm more focused 'cause my lifestyle's bogus
I got to get out, 'cause this fast life's over

You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win

They say the ends, justifies the means
So I guess a drug dealer justifies the fiends
Poverty and unemployment justifies the screams
The reason he stacks his paper, just to buy it clean
2006 with shoes the size of me
But in the end, he wasn't really what he tried to be
I'd never let no war justify me
I question how hard some of these cats really be
'Cause real niggas don't speak, our actions talk more
Don't make me flip and turn these streets into a chalk board
I do this for all the real niggas that smoke trees
The hustlers, players, pimps, and O.G.'s
For the up-and-coming cats, to the old schoolers
The ones that remember Private Stock, and Calvin Coolidge
It's a struggle to make it, keep pushing
See how far you can take it, two eye, or one eye Navigate it, what?

You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win
You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win

I know this cocksucker pulling me over because of my skin
(just be cool)
But the secret is to win, so I hold it in
I'm yes sir-ing, no sir-ing , but when he pull off he diss
A motherfucking, dick-sucking, redneck son of a bitch!
All it takes is one pussy who ain't getting none
To catch you on a dark street, and put you to sleep
Dude was one deep, at the store, he said I ain't no ho'
Got clapped in the back of his 'fro, woo!
It didn't have to go like that, believe me mister
Someday, niggas gon' respect these pistols
Play the safe, get out the way, when a fool got the ups
Pride'll get a motherfucker shot in the guts
And remember this before you grown, until the day that you gone
Greed it don't last too long
The secret is to range up out the game, and have money for life
Not to stick around 'til you lose all your shit to the vice

You've got seasons to rise, and moments to descend
You'll find the peace in the end
Don't cry, the secret is to win

Uh-huh
I guess I'll open it up
Y'know?

It's on, ring the alarm
Got a full metal jacket and the P7 I'm clutchin in my palm
When the first shot ring out, the last man standin
Be the last man they bring out, ain't nobody starin
Niggas is gettin somewhere they know the gunner ain't for play
He got some niggas in the parkin lot sparkin off the AK
So rat-tat-tat, tat 'til yo' ass hit the motherfuckin flo'
What that FaceMob lookin like ho?
You want drama, I'mma send it at you full speed pussy
The last of this motherfuckin species, push me
When it's on end your life, fuck who wrong you was right
You the nigga center stage, better go and get a stripe
Cause tonight, you fucked with big dawgs but they bite
Now I'm at you with a vengeance nigga, go and grab the mic
I don't threaten motherfuckers in the booth, I'm the truth
I was out there in the hood, nigga where the fuck was you?

I'm quick to introduce niggas to real nigga shit
I don't bullshit with niggas, I kill niggas quick
Face the motherfuckin facts, you a rapper I'm a killer
I'm respected in these streets cause I'm a real-ass nigga

I don't pay too much attention, to a nigga with lip
As long as the dawg barkin, he can't bite shit
They got yo' record in the store you fuckin clown
They got my motherfuckin record downtown
Stop crook, everybody know you mushy
You transparent, and I can see you pussy
Pussy, pussy pussy, up in your drawers
All you need is some weed and alcohol
Bitch niggas get dusted, I'm here to stay so get adjusted

You can round up every motherfucker you know
But when the time say so, I'mma get wit'chu ho
I know you prayin that protection talk gon' get you saved
But nigga you ain't doin nuttin but diggin your grave
And you talk about that gangsta shit, it's so funny
If a nigga think you real, I'm the motherfuckin Easter Bunny

Killer comin' at cha niggero subtracter
Small time dope game plenty heart though
Good girl go bad I'm high off a motherfucker!

And travelled the world with a nigga named Bushwick
Lost a memeber back in December
Nigga gets respect from Boston to Denver
Compton, Jersey, Philly, Brooklyn, Oakland, Dallas, Houston look man
It ain't a god damn thing being took
From the bad boys of Houston so go ahead and dial a crook
And watch some niggas spit the game cool
Ran back and brace yourself nigga cause here it comes fool

Gangster of Love (Gangster Boogie!!),The Geto Boys,1990,"Gangster Boogie, Gangster Boogie!!
Gangster Boogie, Gangster Boogie!!
Gangster Boogie, Gangster Boogie!!
Gangster Boogie, Gangster Boogie!! (*Gun Shot*)

I've never been played by a ho!
If the bitch is acting stupid, she has gotta go!
So mother fuck the Miss Sag
If she fucks with me, I'ma kick her little monkey ass!

See you whores got it wrong!
Think since some nigga said he loves you he ain't strong
Bitch, you're taking shit the wrong way
And I can tell right now, it's gonna be a long day!

I got to educate you brothers
If the bitch won't give up the play
Fuck! her, move along to the next trick
See I'm the type of nigga tell a girl suck dick!
 What if she is not sucking?
That's a waste of time conversation, I'm not fucking
I'll just put my fucking pants on
And tell the idiotic freak to take her tramp-ass home!

Cause I don't need a fucking dumbie!
I need a bitch to lick my nuts, until my dick is coming
And after that you'll earn your gloves
HAHA! ~ just call me the gangster of love


Just call me the Gangster of Love

I love the bitches, all kind of bitches
To take off my shirt and pull down my britches
If she is got big titties, I'll squeeze them and hold them
While she suck my dick and lick my scrotum

If she's got a friend I'll fuck her too
Together we can play a game of Switcheroo
I ain't the type, who gets all mushy
I like to sit back and watch them eat each others pussy!

Weak people might say we're insane
But that's the other fucking level of the game
I'll turn your sister out if she fucks with me
If you wanna know my identity


Bitches look at me like I'm a faker
Knowing goddamn well I'm a motherfucking heartbreaker!
I'll have them crying for months
Cause I done fucked their best friends
And put a weapon on their cunt
They have their mothers to call
But if you don't fucked one mom, you done fucked them all
And I really don't give a fuck
Cause if your mom offers me the pussy, she's stuck

Man, that's what type of nigga I am
I'm always gain to run the train, God damn!
Six different whores a night
I use lubricated rubbers, to make the pussy feel right
Better safe than be a victim
If you got a Jimmy Hat, go ahead and dick them
I put the pussy in it's place
And right before I nut, I pull it out, then to the face
And tell the bitch to keep sucking
And prepare herself, for her first butt fucking
And when I'm done, straight to the tub
Just call me the gangster of love


I'm a motherfucker, I put a bitch through a test
If she don't pass, she don't get blessed!
If the test consists, of fucking my whole crew
Well, Bitch! god damn! that's what you gotta do
You say you wanna be down with Willie D
But yet you find it difficult to listen to me
Every time you fuck up and skip a class
I'ma put my goddamn foot in your ass

And if your father wants to buck up
I'll beat the wrinkles out that old motherfucker
I'll treat a bitch like a queen
But she has to realize I'm the goddamn king

Some jealous punk in town
Told my girl I was fucking around and she's still down
To do the same, you've gotta have game
You want to know my name?


Say it Bill (What's up D?)
All the whores mad at us cause we ain't paying for the pussy
And fighting over their asses and shit! (HAHAHA!)
Yeah! but that's that other level of the game again (Damn straight!)
Say it man, While we're on the subject of whores;
Whatever happening to that whore you used to fuck with name Cathleen?

Oh! Cathy, that whore was hot
The first peace of pussy that I ever got!
She fucked me til I was coming
Put her nuts in my mouth and started humming
I said shit commence to checking
She started scratching my dizznik again I said hold up a second
Turned me over on my back gold
Opened up my butt cheeks and started licking up my asshole
That's why I guess that I'm the gangster
And uhh.. Cathleen Johnson sweetheart, I'd like to thank you

Little whores out there are getting stuck
By niggaz like me and we really don't give a fuck!
Big-ass titties and a sexy switch
Whatever you got, you deserved it bitch!

See uhh.. I like to take them fast
Act like I love them, and dog their motherfucking ass
Like for instance Miss P;
The bitch ran her game, and tried to fuck over me
But I sensed it in the making, talking about she's pregnant
 From me or that Jamaican?
She said me of course
So I drug her little ass like a motherfucking horse
That's what you get for trying to play me
I'll kick the bitch SMACK! dead in the ass if she ever says me
Made a kid when I make it
I'll grab her by her motherfucking neck and try to break it!
Cause I knew I wore a fucking glove
You know who you're fucking with bitch?

I'm on another level total
Forget decisions I'm full of vengence can't any nigga hold me
Cause only, I can do what no one does it better
I decapitate niggas wearin' cashmere sweaters
(Let us) Get into some shit that niggas know about from
East to west to north to south no doubt
Every city got their niggas from they hoods
And some from my hood I'm a give one up to my hood

Callin' to the ring if you think you can step
And get your motherfuckin' shirt wet (nigga)

But I prefer to use my gun so you die by
The penetration of a hydroshock
And ain't no comin' back from your death when I come at you nigga by your

And I'm residing on the outskirts of life somebody bring me back

Put my feet down and leave you hoes wet
I brake these niggas off a proper dollar
I get the feeling that you wanting my shit so now I gots to stop ya
There ain't no love for my opposition
Cause they opposition I knock they monkey ass up out position

He wanted drama so I gave it to him
A blood puddle on his way to the ghetto is my rebuttal
The box cutter has his ass beggin' for mercy G
I flipped that out and gave him open heart surgury
It ain't no thang to me to kill a motherfucker
I'll do that shit again if I can watch your mammy suffer
I've had enough of police I ain't scarred
The next time I see the boys in blue they gonna be the boys in red
Cause they gonna bleed yes indeed
Motherfuckers took my weed!
Give me your mind and I'm a open it
Name a law and I've already broken it
Cause I don't give a fuck about the system Willie Dennis
Couldn't give a fuck about the people livin' in it
I know a lot of niggas think that they can get with me
But don't you flush it down the toilet bring that shit to me
And get your ass tore up from the floor up
I got some shit that'll make your motherfuckers throw up
When I attack there's no rewindin'
I hit your ass in the brain with this thang and leave you open minded

And that ain't even the half. I laugh at the thought of a body bag. So all

A warning from the border, my  man, don't you fuck with me

Your card is filed and you'll die when I pull it

No pity on another, it's a game, that's how life goes

Killing and stealing and ganking niggas to get paid

Down on your knees, she'd hesitated, I'd kick the whore
Want to go for bad? Bitch, I go for broke

Out comes the manager, must of thought I was bluffing him
She knew I was serious saw the heat when I busted him
""Come on, motherfucker, I ain't playing so give it up""
She said the cops were coming, ""Does it look like I give a fuck?
""You lucky I ain't horny, I'd be rocking you""
She let down her hair, pulled up her skirt and said ""What's stopping you?""
""Bitch, you must mistake me for a lolly gag
""'Cause if I get in that ass they'll haul me off in a body bag
""Give me the money, I'm tired of the waiting and shit""

Doing crime in H-Town in my prime
Robbed the same motherfuckers four or five times
Where was the cops when I was ripping off dividends?
Out writing tickets to hard working citizens
They ain't never been smart enough to catch me
But one day I went criming with a pussy
He got shot and hit the floor
I ran non stop to my Goddamn front door
Stashed the cash in case
A clue led the motherfuckers to my place
I grabbed the bib, cleaned my popper
And what did I hear? A Goddamn chopper
Damn, ain't this a bitch?
The motherfucker must have snitched
I thought about putting some heads to bed
But I played to stay instead
Surrender, the last day of November
Made bond the first day of December
Promised myself when I see that snitch
I'd kill that son of a bitch
Went scrap to slay everyday
I just couldn't, put the fucking gun away
Wait a minute, I'm full of those 40's
Caught his ass slipping at a block party
Killed the motherfucker as he said, ""D, please""
Put holes in his ass like rat cheese

Ugh, ugh..

These busted ass whores are going crazy
You might as well take up ? and point them at babies..
And watch their motherfucking brains, split
And take the rep for the murder you did, you son of a bitch
Cause killing babies ain't gank
Suppose your mamma would've flushed your ass down her ass crack
You dumb ass whores with no hope for
Killing babies ain't shit, you wanna vote for
They're just trying to wipe her ass out
Cause the niggas be the ones with their bellies all poked out
And even like to be decided by another
You need to pass me a gat, and let me kill some of you motherfuckers
That's why I'm glad we got niggas
Because this world would be fucked if it was ran by you stupid bitches
At least give the kids a chance
And if you're going unprotected, keep your pussy in your panties
Cause you whores will get the Guillotine
If I was the judge for one of you bitches killing off the unseen

What the fuck is this protesting?
Legalizing killing babies and shit with no question
Police beating up the freeze cutie
Cause they were praying for the unseen dead bodies
And us niggas ain't playing that game, bitch
Fuck George Bush for supporting that lame shit
And While I'm at him fuck way too
Little murdered more innocents cause they cooperated bitch you
Get the dick out of your mouth
And wake up because you're sending these kids to the slaughter house
Instead of sending out niggas to the meets cutter
You need to send some of these gay motherfuckers
Ugh, now listen to me ladies: Howcome you're killing them?
But don't pity your little babies
Now, think about that!
They bring your ass some blood wrapped up in a paper sack
Wake up from this motherfucking dream

And stop killing the unseen

Prat got pregnant, now she is off to the bathroom
To get the baby sucked out her ass with a vacuum
Label her killer, her and the doctor thats doing it
Shouldn't had your ass out screwing, bitch
Unprotected, getting that sperm injected
Now, you wanna cry cause you're pregnant!
They need to pass the bill
To stop all these babies getting killed
PBs getting pregnant fudge thrill
But they won't stop it
Cause everybody is in it for a profit
Politicians looking at their pockets
And this shit is senseless
People getting whipped due this baby killing business
We need to get a grip and chill
And stop sending our unseen to the killing field

Ugh, and you know what Big Mike?
We gotta talk about.. these niggas who, you know..
Let these girls go through this shit though, right?!
You know what I'm saying?
Now, break that shit off

What's happening my nigga; what's happening my man?
I know what you're thinking, I know your motherfucking plan
Run, run, run from your motherfucking duties
Didn't want the baby but you wanted the bitch's booty

Fuck her then forgot her, get her right but then you'll quit her
Told her have an abortion or you ain't getting back with her

Another baby dying, another bitch crying
Another nigga lying when he needs to be frying

For going in the murder, he never meant to hurt her
But now she had the baby, all he did was desert her

Xed her out, kicked her to the curb and dumped her
Dumb motherfucker, ain't you heard of a rubber
And if not a rubber, respite the bulleting

Women admirin my baldhead and glasses
They makin passes, I see they asses, I'm gettin flirty
I got that liquor in my system plus I'm wild and dirty
In my pockets is tickets for the Rockets
Million dollar nigga from the projects
I see no logic in niggas' hate when I ride past
My .45 sing lullabyes to they tired ass
See me, I be a candidate for bustin
Don't fuck around unless you ready for the repercussions
Baby blushing, she drives a Benz, but I handle em all
Sophisticated as fuck, and she ain't wearin no drawers

I met the broad in the parking lot, riding a 'Stang
Pulled her way up to her parking spot to ask her name
She hesitated for a minute, then she finally stopped
When she seen a nigga hollerin at her ridin a drop
Out her car to my passenger side the bitch came
Say she in a hurry this time, but no thang
Here's the pager number, I can call at night
Rarely ever beeped a bitch, but this broad was tight
Better yet got the cellular number, she seemed changed
Diamonds 'bout the size of a dime, and these thangs
Tend to to em open, no question and one reason
That diamonds be a girl's best friends, so I treat them
Like bitches

These bitches I be doin in, hoes I be screwin, and
If she talk about her friends, then I probably flew em in
What's a man troublin, like fuckin in a bubble Benz
With her hair in the wind, sittin up from the rim
Gettin ????, plenty room, it was in the month of June
I was on promotional, she was into trickin dudes
I'm no dude, or no guy, but I can fuckin get you high
I won't tell you any lie, I don't play with any mind

Ha ha, oh! I ain't just talking about the females
You know, it's a lot of niggas, that have ho like qualities
Just peep that shit, I suppose they mad at the clothes
Cash flows, ha ha
Verse One
Look at these haters, pulling me over, in my 'Gator
Dirty fuckers, they ain't nothing but some Cock suckers
Fifteen rolling through the B-Nickle
And everything's working on my V-Hickle
I'm sick of all you motherfucking, crooked cops
The minute you pussies see me ya, you make the block
Checking out your screen, hoping I ain't clean
Mother fuck your guns and your badge and ya sirens
All my cop homies, I gotta recognize em
Not only do I know my rights, I exercise them against
You motherfuckers that abuse your authority
Ain't no pressure to bust a cap in your ass cause you ain't special
You breathe like me, you bleed like me, from slugs
So why you mean mugging when I come in the club?
What you jealous of? - the jewelry, ha ha, the money, the car?
Don't hate me cause I'm paid homeboy

Niggas been playa hating me, like some hoes
Been talking about me lately, like some hoes
That's how it is when you live majorly, I suppose
Throwing shit all up in my Bentley, ya'll some hoes
[Verse Two
I met her hanging out at a sports bar, posted up
Nigga off in training camp, flossing in his Expedition
Thinking he can change a tramp, but see, she on a mission now
Checking out my stone blocks
Earrings, Rolex, wedding band, it don't stop
But now we making contact, eye to eye, she's smiling
Bleached white shinning, fat ass just'a profiling
Now I'm out on the grinding, finna to get her paper work
Game tight to a science, we're both involved, let's make it work
Took her to a restaurant, admiring the 512 Testarossa '92
It's a Old School but oh well, headed to a private spot
Get her out the Parking Lot
Nigga, must be knew the broad, what this nigga talking bout
He gonna tell her boyfriend, what the fuck is that gon' do?
Long as you don't fuck with me, I ain't finna fuck with you
Burning up her cell phone, leaving hella call notes
I'm listening to you hatin man, man this bitch is all throat

Verse Three
I'm just minding my business, officer what is this?
Don't shoot me in my kidneys
I just came from my gal crib and she's talking shit
She said somebody's been calling her, some old stalking bitch
Who said I fucked her, and left her, she reminds me of you
Who always run behind me, whining feelin blue
So is why would you fucking with me, while I'm tryin to chill?
You think I'm selling crack, from a '79 Seville
Just got an open can of beer and it ain't even kicked in
You've been following me, fucking with me every since 610
I'm just trying to go and see my very close good friends
Who calling up on an ounce and I'm finna pitch in
So, I'm just, rolling, car not stolen
Keep it tight white and the Vogue stripes golden
Hoping, freaks will get inside of my Lacville '79
But you keep hating on me",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-like-some-hos-lyrics

Changin' face after motherfuckin' face
Watchin' niggas catch dope case after dope case
Add it up and you'll find mo' niggas doin time in the pen

Wouldn't come and pay his homeboy's bail

Caught a case for another nigga and he swear he never knew ya
12 months in the county, you done got out and found out
That your homie runs his own dope house
And he ain't gave you shit

And he still calls you family
But I be damned if I be kin to a nigga who ain't payin' me
Cause I ain't with that ho shit
So if you thinkin' 'bout fuckin' me, nigga, you better try some mo' shit
Cause I done paid my dues and like a fool in the process
Watch another nigga progress
Off the motherfuckin' shit I did
But in the '90s, it's payback and I ain't takin no shorts, kid
Cause life is a bitch
And I ain't that nigga to be broke while makin another motherfucker rich
So wise up, nigga, get with the program
Cause in this dirty game you gotta wash your own hands
And I got a Tec-9, ready to take mine and what's for me
Ho, yeah, no nuts no glory

Now I done heard a nigga say they callin' me the biggest bitch in Texas
Cause I'm bummin' a ride when I should be drivin' Lexus
But you know I gives a fuck about what niggas say
I handle mine by handlin' shit my own way
I let niggas think it's cool
To fuck a nigga like me, but they don't know who they psychin' fools
See, I stay low key
Lettin a nigga think he know me, but he really don't know me, G
Claimin' that we friends
When my little girl is ridin' the bus and his little girl is ridin' a fuckin' Benz
Who's your friend, ask yourself that shit
The only friend I got is my fuckin' pistol grip
Filthy rich, I know you love it
I done made yo ass fat and you still talkin' 'bout 25 off a hundred
Be real, that shit went out in '86
I'm down with the Geto Boys but my mind ain't playin' tricks, bitch
Still refuse to give me mine? Cool
Nigga be that way and I'mma handle my business, fool
Just like my nigga Snoop Dogg told me
You gotta get down for your shit while you can, homie
And you's about to get yo ass lit up
Cause the fuckin aim proper and I ain't the nigga that's catchin the nut
Payback is a motherfucker, payback is a bitch
But payback is a must when I ain't the nigga that's gettin rich
Cause life ain't but one big chance
And unlike these other motherfuckers I ain't scared to touch yo bitch ass
Cause if you believe in fuckin niggas, you's a ho
And the Peter Man can't tolerate hoes, so you gots to go
Mr. Big Man, Mr. Big Nuts
Got everybody thinkin you's the shit
But really I'm the motherfuckin' one
So I'm about to grab my shit off the self
And go on a mission, one nigga gettin' busy by his damn self
So keep on thinkin' you fuckin' me
But while you thinkin' I be pullin/ your fuckin' number, G
Cause I'm a nigga with no heart and no worry
Gettin' down for mine, bitch, no nuts no glory",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-no-nuts-no-glory-lyrics
Cereal Killer,Till Death Do Us Part,1993.0,"Always after my Lucky Charms and shit
Apple Jacks and shit like that

Once upon a time at the Honeycomb Hideout
Sugar Bear and Mikey sat alone gettin fried out
Lucky walked in with this nigga name Rice Grain
Pulled out a knot and conjured up a dice game
Lucky looked at Mikey and he said with a smile
Where's the silly rabbit, I ain't seen him in a while?
Mikey turned to Lucky, shook his head cause he ain't know
Probably trickin with this bitch from Rocky Road named Cheerio
I'm trippin off this shit cause I ain't never seen it right
I'm feelin kind of leary cause I'm higher than a kite
This vibe has really got me on this other level
It's time to mark a murder, my victim's Fruity Pebbles
I'm killin any motherfucker jumpin in my mix
I'm out to get you Pebbles, heard the bitch was turnin tricks
I'm packin up my shit, I'm longin for some red cock
Ups, ain't this a bitch, Face is on his way to Bedrock
Shortly after gettin there I met up with the freak
Nearly cuttin the bitch in half like some Shredded Mini Wheats
I'm makin my escape, sneakin out the back
Fuck, I'm bein spotted by this fag named Apple Jack
I put it on his ass so he couldn't come back to key me
Bleedin like a hog, I guess he musta ate his Wheaties
He used to kiss dicks with his partner Special K
I never had respect for homosexuals anyway
I'm on my way to Houston, played it safe I rode the ferry
And ran across this motherfuckin cop named Frankenberry
He's starin at a niggam, had the looks as if he knows me
He asked about the Bear, I said, Yeah, the Bear's my homie
The shit was kind of shadyk, I was nervous from the jump
Arrivin at the docks he got the word from Captain Crunch
Arrested for a murder, so now I'm thinkin, Shit
I didn't know that Captain Crunch was Cuckoo for this bitch
My trial came up and now I'm thinkin guilt
This dried up situation needs a little bit of milk
I had a half a gallon and ( ? ) a nigga bought it
Reached and grabbed my spoon and made a motherfuckin run for it
I ate 'em up and washed 'em down with Miller

It's that motherfuckin' thug shit
I'm bustin' slugs shit
Young and schoolboy
I'm becomin' a drug dealer
In the streets of that West
I wouldn't settle for less
Until I got my hands on that Smiff and that Wes
Niggas try to swollow me
It's all about survival, G
Fuck these bitch Niggas
It's off some trouble, G
I blow 'em in the wind
And then I sell again
I pack a 9 milli

Niggas, I done told ya
Blow 'em up like dohja
Your momma couldn't keep ya
So I ain't tryin' to hold ya

Give me a life sentence
Picture it ain't over
Untill the Nigga finish
With that motherfuckin' thug shit

It Ain’t Shit,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Scarface:
Niggas hangin' deep on the cut
Sippin' on a motherfuckin' 40 ounce of Gooden
Ain't shit changed in my hood since '86
And 1987 I was swore into the clique
All the triflin' bitches in my hood smoked moes
And all the gangsta ass niggas rode vogues
Drop Monty Carlos, El Dogs and Caddy Coups
Firin' up fry flaggin' hoes out the roof ?
Car down crush ? and fresh paint
Eight in the back you hear my Alpine crank
All of my niggas they had a truck load of dope
Cause back in the gang you can get it by the boat
It's 1993 new bounds are being broken
If you ain't bangin' then you gots to be smokin'
Cause I remember back when the nigga had green
Seen him at the pipes and now the nigga is just a dope fiend
Funny how a nigga, sold a key or two
Is down on his ass and all of a sudden he remember you
Everythings cool I'm the niggas man
Reachin' out his arm tryin' to shake a nigga hand
But I just walked away and left his shit to hang
Cause back in the game I had a motherfuckin' thang
And that's why I walk with my hands on my dick
A nigga say ""what up?""
I look around and I say ""This!""
And I could give a fuck if the nigga gets pissed
Cause if he wants a chunk I'm a get up in his shit
Scarface talking:
Huh like it ain't shit yeah. I thought you knew. It ain't shit. Uh, yeah
Yeah. Yeah
Scarface:
Creepin' comin' up a yellow stonin'
Put my shit in park and drunk a St. Ises with my homey
Reminisced on fast times past times and shit
Smokin' on some bud I came acroos my nigga Kick
I gave my boy some dap and asked him what's the haps
Chillin' with this girl and a gat across his laps
I knew he had some drama I didn't even have to ask it
Now where were them bitches at it's time to kick some asses
He told what had happened and now I'm thinkin' FUCK
I'm callin' up south acres it's time to get 'em up
My motherfuckin' neighborhood is quick to get with static
Never showin' fear cause these niggas never had it
Everybody's trapped, quick to go to war
Quick to kill your ass quick to jack your car
So if you see some shit then I suggest you punch it
Cause what's about to happen you may not be able to stomach
Killers killers killers steady smokin' fry
So nigga lay it down or die motherfuckers die
Fuckin' with my family you dick is in the paint
So don't think that it's shit cause niggero it ain't
Shit to brake 'em off I'm brakin' 'em off with chunks
Siggedy south iggedy acres ain't no motherfuckin' punks
And drive-by shootin' ain't the motherfuckin' shit
Cause niggas plot hits after motherfuckin' hits
Killin' you ass for kicks doin' shit for the murder
And since you want me to die you gots to die cause you deserve ta
Now here take two motherfuckin' slugs (bang)
Cause fuckin' with the kid is the grounds of being drugged
Mister mister Face the hardest nigga being heard
Cause all I have in this world is my balls and my word
I'm sick of motherfuckers thinkin' they run shit
Until you face to face wiith Scarface you ain't done shit
I'm killin' off you mark ass niggas with a slug from a Glock motherfuckers
I'm a born killer, I really thought you knew bitch
I'm slappin' hoes and cappin' fools

No Sellout,Grip It! On That Other Level,1989.0,"The Negro, the negro still.. is not free

No Sell out!!
The Negro, the negro still... is not free

No Sell out!!

Here's another Geto Boys' release
I came to teach to those I didn't reach
On the G.O., with a 
clean cut so
Don't give me no junk about the radio
Kiss it where the sun don't shine
I think it's time the public knew the time
Rap Music, they're trying to ban it
Cause blacks are getting paid and they can't stand it
They say we're too violent for instance
But why in the hell is Rock still in existence?
I'ma tell you why it still remains, like a coat it'll hang
Cause it's a white thing
This attack on the black sound
Is just one more plot to keep brotherman down
I ain't with this, God is my witness
Somebody better tell those folks I mean business
And it ain't no sell out

Black man, stand up!!
Somebody has to speak the truth against it
Black man, stand up!!
Somebody has to speak the truth against it

Public Enemy was dissed by the industry
Cause the people they trusted sold out to the..
Opposition and superstition
The foundation wasn't sound for the mission
They said the group did something wrong
But that's a lie, you heard the songs
They encouraged blacks to excel
And when that happens, people'll get scared as hell
Call the Police they got rob
Right under that nose, it have to be an inside job
And who was that clown from Washington?
The son of a 
{bitch}
 who triple-cross them
I ain't talking about the provident brother
This particular chump was our color
Got a scoop on the group and he ran
Lock him up for impersonating a black man
Uncle Tom, you want some?
Rap-A-Lot ain't the one, find another son
PE give me five, show them what you got
(FIGHT THE POWER!!)
Ain't no sell out


Yo D, I'm mad as hell, man
Every time a black man starts preaching the way up to the black community
Them folks get to messing with him
 They call that Fear of a Black planet, get me?
 I got you

Well, why don't you get up there and tell these people
What the Geto Boys already know

Sure..
We as a people, are not yet free
The first amendment, only applied to the other race
We never had a taste
How can you see the light when you're maced?
Chuck D, Flavor Flav, let them rip
They ain't got enough wind in this trip
For every voice they try to quiet
There'll be another one, and another one starting a riot
If that's what it takes
Yo, I keep the faith, I gotta break
And despite how they sabotage, they gonna have to realize
That this ain't no sell out

Black man, stand up!!
Somebody has to speak the truth against it
Black man, black man
Somebody has to speak the truth against it

The truth will set you free, someone quoted
Butt Griff struck a nerve with the jews when he told it
CBS was just looking for a reason
To get him out, and that was all they needed
I wasn't surprised by this tactic
I knew it would happen, but I didn't know exactly
Triple-Cross go to hell
You think since you did that would start now narrating fairytales?
Think again sucker
If I was a belt you couldn't make me buckle
The Geto Boys, still bringing the noise
You're losing your poise, getting played like toys
Selling the enemy info
That's what got us where we was two hundred years ago
Saw Dollar Signs, didn't ya Captain?
Without sacrifice ain't nothing happening
The plan is to hold us back
The ulitmate gold is total control remember that, Jack
Griff, I got your slack, and I'ma hold it 'til you get back
Cause I ain't going sell out

Somebody has to speak the truth against it
What do I care about anger in you?
Somebody has to speak the truth against it
What do I care about anger in you?

Leanin on You,The Foundation,2005,"If, you move, I'll fall
I'm leanin on you, you baby, you baby

Geto Boys
Willie D
We was livin' on Colfax, cops sat in old 'Llac
Couldn't get along with T Jones, so he rolled jack
I was on Prozac before I was 12
Spent my senior year in high school, sittin in jail
To no avail, I was SCREAMIN OUT and nobody heard me
Messed around and got shot, but it didn't deter me
I think I was 14, so my boy was one-trey
Cut my hair one day, left my crib and got sprayed
And expired right away, nothin' to say, sad chapter
Around here, either you get killed or you get captured
Sister girl, I ain't know what you was dealin with
Pointed the finger at you, now I'm feelin like an idiot
But I'm wiser now, and I've seen the world
It's messed up, how they treat us Geto Boys and girls
The doctors tried to resuscitate, it was too late
I got a daughter named Kain and a son named Blake
And they be askin 'bout you, all the time
I try to be a better man, sometimes I fall behind
So if you feel some extra weight on you, don't be alarmed
Don't move, don't flee, that's me - leanin on you

I'm leanin on you

Y'all wonder why I act crazy, life don't phase me
For me to still be above ground it's just amazing
Wasn't aware bein different gave me intangible wealth
That's why I, took a gun and tried to kill myself
My folks got the blame of course, I used to ask
Why did God make my brother so tall and me a dwarf?
This ain't no ""poor little me song,"" that's so phony
I got a good life, I'm just sharin my testimony
But could you imagine bein me, for one hour, one day
One week, one month, one year? Get out of here!
You'd never make it, life's not fair
Everywhere you go, people point, people laugh, people stare
They don't care, so I don't care, most of the day
I feel awkward but I believe I'm goin to hell if I don't pray
As I laid, on that hospital gurney, fightin for my life
I felt the demons touch my body then I saw the light
That was you, I know it was you
Cause all the love in the world from my family couldn't pull me through
Lord, when it gets really rough
You're the only one that's strong enough to hold me up
That's why I lean on you

I'm leanin on you

You're my one and only friend, ever since I was a kid
We've been in and out through thick and thin, tryin to get a win
Broke as fuck on the corners like a nigga had diplomas
Back in 1985, skippin class, gettin high
Fat Turner we were walkin, I remember you was talkin
'bout this lick we was supposed to hit and turn us all to bosses
So we took that trip to Austin, and we came back with this package
That would later turn this strongest friendship into us scrappin
Ain't too sure about what happened, all I'm knowin is it was money
Had a nigga wagin war against who I thought was the homey
Shoulda known this shit was evil, by the way it did my peoples
And the whole entire neighborhood fucked up behind this needle
Now we roam in the Regal, windows tinted, dem bangin
Pistol grip on the frontseat, smokin and steady drankin
Drunk and I'm steady thankin we probably shouldn't left it
Cause every time that a nigga drops a record you arrested
It's depressin, but life and it's lessons'll leave us guessin
Gettin out, was a blessin, but lately a nigga stressin
Which leads me to this question, was money the only reason we feuded
Cause now that we got it, homey let's keep it movin, let's move

I'm leanin on you

I'm leanin on you",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-leanin-on-you-lyrics

I know y'all niggas gon' feel this shit right here
(G.B.!)
We're goin through the same thing

Weapons bein loaded and cocked, bodies drop
Ghetto niggas, they hang on the corner sellin rocks
Fuck the cops, they brutalize the poverty-stricken
Institutional racism prevalent in prisons
Quick decisions are made with precisions of blood-spill
Gotta make a mill, got a house on the hill
Protect my grill, and avoid gettin killed
Now if I land on the concrete with bloody pants
Lord please, give your homeboy a second chance
Baby need a new pair of shoes, and a college fund
My P.O. wanna know how I got a gun
I'm in the presence of my enemies like in the bible
Will I see heaven if I murder these fuckin rivals?
I'm havin nightmares of niggas' final cries
If I die today, will I be idolized?
I gives a fuck, if you dwell from the East to West
As long as you feel the south, nigga, you can bet
I got...

Nothin but that gangsta shit to my thugs
Puffin on a gang of shit smokin luv
Niggas gangbang and shit, rub-a-dub
No matter what you claim and shit, throw it up (2x)

Forgive me what I past did, hustlin for loot
Pass the casket, lookin at my friend in basket
Touch him with my lips, feelin like he blasted
I never seen a man cry
But my lifestyle is fear, sittin around watchin muthafuckas die
The faces of death
Who coulda predicted 2Pac would be next?
Read ghetto text: if you live by the sword
Or speak about it too much, you gon' die by the sword
So think about it, do us an injustice, you know time flies
Life, I can't trust it, so I stay high
Six-time felony, no one can handle me
I'm constantly fuckin up my family
To the moms a casualty, I got love
But this a little gangsta shit, to my thugs


I be a muthafuckin thug till the day I die
Called in this world to be a rider, so I'm ridin high
My blood-shot eyes coincide with my frame of mind
Forever mobbin with my niggas from offa both sides
It's G.B. family, fuck y'all bitch-mades
We in the game to run the whole thang
Return and leave from A to Z
Bonafied thug in my blood, part of the ghetto
Niggas runnin when I'm up in meadow
I'm black devil with the shovel when I'm near, nigga
Don't fear, nigga, this is war in yo ear, nigga
Right here, nigga, real niggas
Representin thugs, we all action
We body-baggin (body-baggin) and toe-taggin
Your reaction is flatline, no pulse
Straight killers, thugg niggas with no heart

And that's how that shit go, nigga
We ain't gon' never stop doin this shit
I know them muthafuckas can't stand it
When them goddamn geto boys come hot
Cause we gotta represent niggas all over the muthafuckin world
We got Geto Boys all over the world
And that's why we always break shit down
To the muthafuckin smallest compound
Nigga, you fuck with us
You hoes'll get mugged, drugged
We ain't havin no muthafuckas down in the fuckin front row
Gettin kisses and hugs
Nigga, that's how we doin that shit
Down South, muthafucka

Get em up, nigga, buck-buck, represent yo shit
Smokin weed got you fucked up, now you niggas hit
Fuck with me, nigga, what's up talkin all that shit
Now we face to face, muthafucka, who you with?
Ain't nobody got your back now, you in trouble
Oh, he know how to act now, huh? We in double
Always sickin out and stomp out, nigga gettin nervous
And that stutterin in your voice, pal, that's gon' get your service
Ain't no muthafuckin game, nigga, disrespect
Remember the next time that bullshit gon' get you x-ed
Do yo thang, but don't you ever trick
Don't you ever switch, if you get caught, then don't you ever snitch

Your brains blowed out, body in a trash bag
Unidentified, chalk him up a John Doe
Got most of the pieces, but they ain't found his arms though
It's far from a record, I'm different than these rap dudes
A real nigga, won't hesitate to clap fools
Ski-mask you, come up to where you lay at
Cock back, squeeze, and put him where your face at

You know who I'm wit, so I ain't gotta say names

Ain't never had love for y'all, make me clap you
And it's a done deal, don't fuck with what the truth is
And hide behind that motherfuckin desk but when the truth's here
It's on for ya, that mean your lifeline shortens
Death to the niggas who disrespected the Jordan
I'm not a pop nigga, fuck what radio say
Fuck what video do, but this is all day
Hood nigga, I ain't gotta show you what my life like
Cause you don't persecute a motherfucker like Mike
I ain't a house nigga scum like you fools is
I was bred born and raised in this true shit

Funny how a nigga get caught up in all the glamour
And then they finally come to grips that this can happen
To anybody, won't discriminate who catch this
Get in the way and you a victim of a death wish
A declaration of a war and it's a warning
Follow the leader but be aware your opponent
Is in the window got guerillas where you rest at
And prepared to hit a motherfucker, bet that

Aight, let's get serious
Fuck the rap game I'm the realest nigga, PERIOD
If you ain't feelin me you know how it goes
Jump bitch, I cain't wait to kill one of you hoes
It's on if you got beef
You can be a cop, a drug dealer, or a pro athlete
Bottom line, I don't give a fuck about'cha
If I pop you in the neck, I bet some blood come out'cha
While your label only behind you greasin his dick
Your stupid ass on a video, cheesin and shit
J ain't shorted me a dime if he owe you bucks
The way I see you a bitch and you deserve to be fucked
Willie D is the nigga that'll bloody your clothes
Don't think you know me cause you know the hook to ""Baldhead Ho""
I light you up with a sawed off; and stab yo' ass
In the leg, in the chest, in the back and mouth

Aight nigga; stab him in the leg in the chest
In the back and mouth, let 'em haul him off
Give me a motherfuckin handy shotty
And a plug of PCP, I'll kill anybody
Bust him in the ass 'til he's still
I'm Chuckwick bitch, your achilles heel
A short nigga quick to give a tall ass-whoopin
Got a chip on my shoulder bout the size of Brooklyn
Lookin to start shit, I ain't scary like Scooby and Shaggy
Piss me off you better Duck like Daffy
Even if you in a rest home I'll pop ya
Even if you got a vest on I'll drop ya",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-declaration-of-war-lyrics
Murder Avenue,Till Death Do Us Part,1993,"Creeping down the hallway quiet as kept
The only sign of a murder was the blood on the foresteps
I stopped for a second to wipe it up
And threw the bloody towel in the garbage bag with her guts
Pretty as a picture her name was Rosie
Had to kill the bitch cuz she was getting too fuckin nosey
A school ho she attended U of H
A law student who was looking for a fuckin' case
But she was barking up the wrong tree, g
Ay yo why in the hell did the bitch wanna fuck with me
Walking around my crib steady casin'
Askin' about the strange smells that were coming from my basement
She asked one too many motherfuckin questions it was time
Somebody taught the stupid bitch a good lesson
I snuck in the house through the back door
It was like a scene from Psycho
The bitch was in the shower
I rushed her quick so she wouldn't have a chance to holler
And said ""shut the fuck up, ho""
And slammed her motherfucking head against the cold floor
Struggling soaking wet
I gagged her mouth with a whole box of kotex
After I fucked her check out what I did
Slit her fucking stomach and watched her squeal like a pig
The shit was gruesome, g, I couldn't call it
I cut off her fingers and flushed them down the fuckin' toilet
Then wrote my name on the wall like I usually do
To mark a murder ho, yeah on murder avenue

More murder, more murder, more murder, yo
More murder, more murder, more murder, watch me hurt a ho
More murder, more murder, motherfucking murder, nigga
More motherfucking murder gots ta pull the trigger
More murder, more murder, more murder, check it
A hundred and fifty seven thousand victims in a second

Gotta give it up to Bridget and Ted brand new newly-weds
There's nothing I would love better than to have their fuckin' heads
On a platter I watch them sonofabitches scatter
In broad daylight but yo it really didn't matter
I put the gun to their heads and said, ""shut up""
The nigga was big I watched this big motherfucker nut up
On the rampage both of 'em got pistol-whipped
The 9 was bloody so I pulled out my pistol grip
The nigga was damn near dead
I grabbed his bitch by her head and told her, ""spread your fucking legs""
I placed the barrel of my pump on her pearl tongue
And stuck a shell inside her pussy and said, ""now ain't that fun?""
She started to cry
I saw a tear fall from here eye, said, ""bitch you must wanna die""
I pulled the trigger of the pump back slowly
And shot up her nigga until he was full of holes, g
The bitch was screaming with rage
I stamped on her motherfucking face until it caved in
'Cos killing is so damn sweet
I saved the remains and used them later for ground meat
Being a lunatic I gotta do the lunatic
Gotta do man, yeah living on this avenue

More murder, more murder, more murder, yo
More murder, more murder, more murder, watch me hurt a ho
More murder, more murder, more murder, nigga
More motherfucking murder gots ta pull the trigger
More murder, more murder, more murder, check it

Hey, J—what’s happening, man?
-- How you doin’?
Oh, I’m pretty good. Still fighting this frame
-- Uh-huh. How everything going?
Oh, it’s rough on a Black man
-- Huh. Yeah, I’ve been hearing a lot of different things
But it ain’t nothin’ like hearing it straight out the horse’s mouth, you know?
Well, the truth is, niggas in the street got to get together all over the nation. I’m talking, we got to get together in Chicago. We got to get together in L.A. We got to get together in Houston. We got to get together in New York. We got to get together in Detroit. Niggas got to get together all over this nation. I’m talking about not the regular people in the street, I’m talking about street niggas. I’m talking about niggas that call themselves gangstas. Real gangstas go to the polls
-- Well, you know, we the ones make the difference, too
Exactly. That’s what’s going to make a difference. You know, that’s that sleeping giant
That’s that 40 percent apathetic vote within our Black community
-- Uh-huh
That’s who we need to ride. That’s who need to awaken. And see, they scared of me because I’m trying to wake that sleeping giant
-- Uh-huh

I just be messin’ with these honkeys, as usual. Because they ain’t worried about me, they got me. But they worried about the kids. Because the youth is more feisty now than it was. And the cold game is what they’re doing now, they done put the prisons on the open market, you know, it’s on the stock exchange. Big companies own prisons now. They all got stock in prisons—MasterCard, Smith Barney. These honkeys so cold out this way, they don’t wanna see me do nothing. They won’t even let my family make no money. Even with the Ghetto Prisoner clothing. They won’t even let my son, my wife, nobody do anything—they messing with the clothing company. They’ve been going to the manufacturers. Their orders ain’t getting there on time no more since the government got involved with this case. They’ve been going to the stores, retailers, and telling them that they can’t sell ‘em. They’ve been stopping the kids here in Chicago…
— You know real ghetto boys wear Ghetto Prisoner gear. We have to look in the inside of the Geto Boys album cover and order from there, we gon’ order from there, you know? ‘Cause we gonna support that
You know, it’s political. But see, the mayor is scared of me
— Yeah
The mayor is scared of me because—they gon’ lay you down and put a dick in your ass. If you move your ass, they consider you rebellious, you know? I’m moving my butt so they consider me a rebellious nigga. See, I’m telling these young boys to put them guns down and pick up that ballot, you know?

You know, you can kill as many niggas as you want as long as you don’t go to the polls

But you can't take the getto out the nigga
Ain't nothing changed since the 70's

Never slippin punk no, a nigga don't lag
Game tight replace a nigga's Nikes with a toe tag
His zoom, his ass, his zigga I'm the founder
Stacking up bodies like Jeffery Dahlmer
Oh, here comes the flow, watch me as I tip toe
To a nigga's window, with my M 6-0
Putting motherfuckers out their misery
And watching the murders reenacted on Unsolved Mysteries
Trick, coward lame pussy ass faggot
Six feet deep is where you sleep with the worms and the maggots
Nigga's can't harm me, Rap-A-Lot army
Coming like Desert Storm, you've been warned
But if you still want some, nigga bring it on

Too Much Trouble done sewed up the tracks
Bitches not playing like they win or get smacked

A weed-smoking motherfucker, plus I kick doobies

Ganksta NIP is fucking your daughter, G
I wake up every morning screaming ""Somebody slaughter me!""
Step in my path, your ass is void
Cause I'm an aerodynamic, satanic, schitzophrentic android
Your mind ain't deep enough, claws can't keep enough
Dead bodies complaining we too loud, they can't sleep enough
Attempted murder, I didn't mean to hurt her
I hadn't ate in two years, I just wanted a cheeseburger
A bulletproof vest won't protect your chest
A whole body is hard to digest
Once I flex, count the next
The hardest I won like the recreation of Malcom X
So bring it on, I'm ready to slaughter
Sickness change quick, a 40 of holy water
Bring it on, huh, bring it on, yeah (Repeat 2x)
Bring it oooooooooooooon!
DMG bring it on

I've been a victim of society
They got me fucked in this whole shit
Niggas running up with M11's and some mo shit
It seems to me they wanna start something
But I'm a let this motherfucking 9 break em off something
My homie panicked cause he never thought it'd come to that
Miggity Mike serving em soft from these niggas gats
I guess it's like guerilla warfare
Now grab your gat and load your clip and go for delf until you make it there
And if you don't then grab your nuts, duke
Cause that's the only way these niggas living in the 9-deuce
More murder by killing and slaying some shit
You fake on the two, you find your homie dead in a ditch
Now the fucking water's getting hot
Homie after homie after homie's getting shot
And niggas are overlookin the joys of life
.357 with them hollow point shells in the midnight
Check it, first I walk up on him like I know him
Then, I let me conversation start to ho him
Yo, I never debates the way I handle my business
Cause niggas always be fucking shit up well it's time to handle they
Business
He's peeping out my missle as I stand straight
So now it's time to make his ass like a crushed grape
Come check a nigga gun for his get zound get click
Yo, you shoulda brought it on

3-2 comin at ya, comin at ya
Don't make me pull my shit and have to cap ya
With my Glock, I make it go ""pop,"" it's a 17 shot

So bring on your motherfucking crew bitch, we can get it on

Strapped assassin, ghetto gladiator
Leaving a path of destruction like the motherfucking Terminator
Lurking the streets of hardcore, stalking like a predator
17 shots to the chest made his clothes wetter than mine
Cause the nine'll hit your ass everytime
Got my motherfucking b-mo, going straight for the dome
Wig-splitting nigga with the finger on the trigger
Sinister, symptoms of a motherfucking killer
B-I-G to the motherfucking M-E

But a cutthroat, smiggity smoking niggas like dope
Now bitch don't choke, cause the dick's down your throat
Getting my blast on, nigga get your ass on
Riggy run your ass home cause I'm a bring it on

It's the return of the motherfucking dreadlock
Putting fools in headlocks, giving niggas headshots
You don't wanna fuck with me, I ain't that motherfucka
I mean that average run-of-the-mill ass nigga
You hoes better recognize that nigga that you up against
Mista mista Scarface ain't that nigga to be fucking with
So lay it down niggas, bump it down or feel the pressure
Cause I'm the type of nigga that's known for taking drastic measures
Quick to rip shit and leave a motherfucker twitching
So niggas make a run once the rifle starts spittin
Round after round after motherfuckin round
So bitches lay it down, I shut em down I shut em down I shut em down
Screaming for vengance I swear that I meant this decended
Surrender suspended cause niggas I meant it
Calm like an Islamic brother from the Nation
Still got the mind of a motherfuckin mental patient
I got the chrome to my own dome
But I'm a give you one before I take it home motherfucka so, uh
Bring it on, huh, bring it on, yeah (Repeat 3x)

There's so much trouble in our life, we got a story to tell
Just like time, we did the crime, and had the cops so sick
They tried to catch us, nuthin' happened, cause we're much too slick
I'm Juke Box, the back-breaker, pose a threat on your life
I slice you up, like Freddy Krueger, lyrics sharp like a knife
And I'm Johnny C the Prince of rhymin', imitators die
You know why? Boy, it's the vengeance of my rappin' ally
He's Ready Red, the top contender, other boys who oppose
So catch the square, and he'll be there, and he'll break your nose
We're makin' trouble
That's right, we're makin' trouble
I've got an Uzi in my hand and I'm in command
I run the nation, say what, Take out the Ku-Klux Klan
I got 'em scared to walk the street after it gets dark
And play con on your sister at Tuffly Park
We're makin' trouble
That's right, we're makin' trouble
Boy, I saw your Filas, say what, And I was on cloud nine
I said Box, busted out, I got to make those mine
I jacked you up off your feet, I snatched out your strings
Size 10, and just right for me to do my thing
We're makin' trouble
That's right, we're makin' trouble
I, what, broke out the store window, with a crime on his mind
With no thoughts or assumption, word, of doin' the time
The cop screamed, boy freeze! .45 in his hand
I dropped the VCR, broke out and ran
I stole the jams off your car, and now it's up on blocks
I snatched the emblem off your Caddy, boy, and you're red hot
We're makin' trouble
That's right, we're makin' trouble
Now for all you small timers, we got to make you slob
'Cause we not only steal cars, homeboy, we also rob
I robbed a store to get a dollar, I snatched a purse, the lady hollered
Then the cops come to my door, and snatch me up right by the collar
And now they're takin' me to jail, yo-yo, a man-made hell
But from behind the steel bars, we could never prevail
The Ghetto Boys are trouble makers, cold common thugs
Tearin' down the neighborhood, but we don't do drugs

They think Ak can't subtract the card
But I will come back, wax and tax the punk
Bought back the track that was large, I kept, these suckers are gone
D.J. Akshen is back and D.J. Akshen is hard
Put rhymes together are clever, tougher than leather however
MC's are tropical feather, don't claim to battle, I'm better
MC's'll die by the dozen, said they was dope but they wasn't
Now I'm tellin' you cousin, get off my jock, cause you buggin'
Got a rhyme let's get to it, gave you a chance but you blew it
You fell a geek an I knew it, Akshen is back so don't do it
See, I perfected perfection, give me some time, just a second
So I can rhyme my selection, my rhymes is burning protection
You see I've seen and I saw a lot of fiends on the draw
Tryin' to get with the king, cool out the king's on the floor
It's time to cool and I chill, it's time to school and I kill
And when you're down for the feel, just let me know and I will
Come around for the brawl, some MC's bank but I roar
They crumble up like toy
Because my mission is to seek and destroy

Here it comes, the voice of the invincible
You're gettin' dumb, come now, let's be sensible
You couldn't hang with the mastermind of wrecking shit
So get a grip and come equipped
Cause I'mma show the real meaning of a massacre
A mad man, disaster cause Ak is the
Great one, I'll never 'fess unless the best
Push the great to the test and I'ma just
Watch 'em crumble up just like the leaves in December
Cut em tough and yell ""timber!""
And after the path is clear I stand
The immortal survivor Akshen
I can't be stopped cause I'm gonna rock until you drop
So full of action that you'll get dizzy then you'll pop
I'm a mastermind and not a toy
And my mission is to seek and destroy

I come equipped, ready for a rhyme war
MC's get flipped one at at time or a
In flocks and flees, the punks you beat, they can't compete
Don't try to make me slip, I don't sleep
I'll break and take the fake who claimed to make the place
To dominate 'cha mate from state to state
Away from the states you make and then begin to ache the head
More like an earthquake
Lyrics begin to penetrate, to spin, the wind that breaks
The skin, you evaporate
That's when I'ma have to make a jam to hold my own
Because Ak control the zone of rap, step off, I'm on the microphone
If you test the best go check arrests and ask the press
How many heads were put to rest
And Ak gon' just get moet and hit the sess
And still be posing a threat
Cause I'm the mastermind and not a toy
And my mission is to seek and destroy

Let me continue or should I say finish this?
This is a dope jam, though some are wishin' this
Will be the last that ya heard of the Ak
But I'll be back to attack on another track
But until then you all follow the dream
Peace! Now let me hear ya scream

Eh Yo Red, cut that up real funky for me, you know what I'm saying?

Say what?

Niggas bustin caps on a Sunday
I'm ridin through the park with my white six bloody
Thinkin to myself, What the fuck is this?
I grab my motherfuckin shit, load the clip and then I get
The extra hollow points out the box in the backseat
I can't believe these motherfuckers tried to x me
Once again I'm in the middle of some fuck shit
A busted window and a dead nigga they left me stuck with
I grabbed the cellular phone and called my nigga Face
Had to beep him 911, he wasn't at his place
The phone rang, I picked it up, I heard, What's up, black?
Some ho-ass niggas bust a cap and shot my nigga Mack
They killed my nigga, now I think them hoes are after me
Just dump the body and meet me over at the draft, G
7 o'clock I dumped the body, now I'm changin cars
Get 'em up with Face, now it's time to take them hoes to war
Called up Billy, told him to meet us on the southwest
Bring a bag of buddha cess and a extra vest
And a fifth of E&J to get this shit right
Cause it's about to be a murder after midnight
(There's gonna be a killin after midnight)
(You can say this one's a murder by a lunatic)
Say what?

3 or 4 minutes to twelve o'clock
Rollin in a undercover huntin for a IRoc
Let's hit the spot and find them hoes who tried to cap ya
Were they killers, yeah, or were they tryina jack ya?
It's hard to tell, we lost our boy behind this punk shit
And when we catch him we gon' chuck him in the trunk, slick
I gives a fuck about the sorry motherfucker
He crossed the family, now I'mma make the nigga suffer
I'm rollin hard, I got my daddy's Smith & Wesson
Six-shot, nickel-plated .357
So keep your eyes peeled, nigga, we gotta find 'em
Turn off the lights and let's creep up behind 'em
We got some burners protectin us
But keep a low pro cause they'll be expectin us
We spotted a Z off at Quarter Lane
I'm killin the bitch, I don't know the man
Creeped up slow, dropped the back window
Hehe... now what's up, ho?
Let off a couple of shots but he had posse
The nigga came out the door and like just shot me
It didn't hit me cause I ducked down
We jumped our ass out the car and turned that bitch into Bucktown
I bring my gats to a fist fight
And bust a cap in a bitch and it ain't gotta be at midnight
(There's gonna be a killin after midnight)
(You can say this one's a murder by a lunatic)

11:45 I pull up on the set
With some down-ass niggas and a van full of gats
Jumped out, fired up my Phillie, went to bustin shots
Had to let 'em know Bushwick Bill was on the fuckin block
Niggas started haulin as I heard Big Mike callin
Jumped in the van, slammed the door and started haulin
Ass around the corner, catch the niggas who had ran
Oki jumped out and went to bust him once again
Uh, makin niggas take cover fast
Cause we was puttin somethin on they motherfuckin ass
Yeah, nine millimeter shells, twelve gauge pumps and shit
So nigga, don't bother runnin for your trunk and shit
1-2-3-4 shots from the infra-red
Left 1-2-3-4 motherfuckers dead
And no witnesses in sight

I got forty five reasons, cock back squeezing
When I hit motherfuckers, I make their block stop breezing
Nigga raids; I hang off in these streets all day
Where the good die young, in the hood I'm from
You got your niggas in the front hood snitching on the back (HUH!)
Your cousin kicked and dipped out, looking at me tripped out
And shit is out the closet, young niggas run the guts
Poisoning their own streets, fucking them up
Now get your squad nigga, be on for real and not a fraud nigga
Let your homies see your heart nigga, a hard nigga
Never hesitates on this, recognizes with insist
I kill and die for bread, make a believer out of the nonbelievers
Now they believe us, cause them that need us
I make the hardest niggas freeze up
Ease up, we put the whores down and the G's up
Get your motherfucking shit straight, or nigga 'B' is up
And squeeze up front, no bullshitting in the game
We're chasing paper; and moving niggas out the way
 + (DMG)
Getting big faces (Fuck the whores, fuck the clothes)
Get your big faces (Ride a Benz, ride a Rolls)
Where your big face is? (In the boat, what you thought?
(Out in biz places, getting big spaces)
Getting big faces (Fuck the whores, fuck the clothes)
Get your big faces (Ride a Benz, ride a Rolls)
Where your big face is? (In the boat, what you thought?
(Out in big places, getting big phases)

I can't lie, I die behind the Sckrilla of mine
All the time, and everyday down to grind
Big faces, I'm steady chasing
Nigga, my pockets can't stand it, goddamn it
I got's to have it, makes me snatching if you don't hand it
Grab your motherfucking whole role, leave you frozen in the cold slow
Bro, you're in the way of goal, you done journey down the wrong row
I want the shit that I can flow though
Nigga, this is Four L-I-F-E
Now suck a dick and make me wealthy
God help me, cause niggas getting rich in this bitch
HUH! and me I'm trying to have shit, the Lache is my dream
To own a piece of the currency, in the street if not the whole steam


I got a new hustle, missiles too dirty about to touch
Strong on the ?? with the mask
Raw to your fellows, hitting various licks
Put the scandalous tricks with vandals who stack chips like architects
I won't be checked, papers filled my life and my soul
I put it down on papers, serving them with verbal capers
Cause all I ever wanted to do in here was getting paid
I agg on shit, chase the vapors until I see that day

I'm about to pay them my gorilla if you're in the midst
Go check this shit, it's realer than the evil counterfeit
I'm liquid, look at the company I hang with
Big Face, J. Prince, Scarface and the Gorilla Click

I represent that green greed
I'm trying to at least spend fifteen
Gs, about to ball like motherfucking creek
Having ghetto dreams, been seeing in million places
By any means, still serving fiends to get them plates
Talking about Big faces


Nigga I record, flip the shit that broke niggas can't afford
Fuck the Honda Accord, we're floating in the Datson
California edition, and sipping on the Netton
Change betto to the metto, dis the motherfucking ghetto
B-O-Y-Z, and I be hiding Iry, buy trees, I like weed
Buy keys, I like Gs, stacked up, in Nikkie boxes
Terracing the closet with safety deposit
The shit that you rap about it I got it

Nigga matters when and where you scheduled to fight
Fuck with Willie D I'll bust yo' fuckin head to the white

Cops ain't about shit
Want us to walk the straight and narrow when they crooked like dicks
They steal and they lie, they snort up their nose
They drink and they drive and they beat up on their hoes

I hate that snitch, I hate that sniiiiiiitch~!

Now listen up, all you hustlers - I got a story or two
I got to tell you 'bout these snitches, because they're snitchin on you
See we're known for 5th Ward and we take no jive
You're like a cat - but guess what - you don't have nines lives, and


NOW, you've, GOT, too
Beware of the snitch - homeboy they smile in your face
Within a few damn hours, he'll piss all over the place
You've got some snitches, homeboy and that's without doubt
But when the press comes out, he'll end up snitchin himself
Because I robbed, I stole, yo and Red got away
We all got got, you know why, because of snitchin away, and

{*Scarface samples*}

And there's, snitches everywhere, and they brought in two
You got caught, crackin and they told on you
But me and dis homeboy was real cool you know
I took his girlie off with me and she gave me a blow
Now just imagine what happened, the very next day
The other fella snitched us on because they couldn't get no play, and


This is the end homeboy, well it's last but not least
Jukebox is gonna hip you to the jams we seek
Do-do-do-do-do-do you know that dance - yeah they call it the wop
But those snitches have a dance they call the crimstop, and

Suicide, it's a suicide...

Retaliation is a must
Leavin' opposition in the dust
In mob we trust, fuckin' with us gon' get your bust
It's a - suicide, it's a suicide
You will die, nigga, you will die
Just like your homeboy did
When we teed off on him
And since you want drama, we fend the weed off the corner
And when I ride
All these niggas better ride
So if you hoes got pride
Then bring your asses outside
And let me say your bad side
But don't you never let me see you sweat
I'm leaving motherfuckers silhouettes - wet
And you can take that as a treath
But I'mma make the promise
These nigga here is comin'
Sick enough to let to make a maggot vomit
With the intentions to retaliate
Illuminatin', then evacuate
Fuck the tear drops on the casket tops
Just open up with shots from the plastic Glock
That leave your ass get got
It's all about gettin' even
Get them muthafuckas when you see 'em
Stop em from breathin

Look at all the heat that you're facing
15 niggas agg in your living room waiting
Passin out shit, bags
Click clacks - toe tags
We came and we kicked that ass
Who run this? Double-O-Seven
Out of 17 and guaranteed to get eleven
I guess you think you're safe
Sorry that you did it
Ho, it's too late
Bitch, you shouldn'ta did it
One by one niggas get they ass done
Pussy make me laugh, nigga, money make me come
Nigga set for life
All on this in pay-per-view
Callin' shots make you call yo' whole fuckin' crew
We gotcha

I ain't playin with this one, pass the pistol
Warriors come out the play when we whistle
What's that sound? Is that them - in the background?
I let the Mac clown and shut this whole set down
Rap-A-Lot Mafia's murderous circle
We kill em done, go get your guns
None survive when I scream the die-die
It's the mister from the free time the dum-dum
Retaliation is a must
Who in the fuck gave you muthafuckas the nuts
To try to buck
Wanna bust? Nigga what?!
It's dust to dust
Ashes to ashes, in the back is where the pistols pump
I lift em up, gives a fuck
I'm quick to bust
Hit 'em up, get 'em up
Once I send 'em up
Now ??? get enough of my gangsta stuff
Retaliation is a muthafuckin' must

I stumbled out the club ????
Drunk as fuck
And plus my visions is blurry
My face swoll' the fuck up
Clothes all muddy
It was buddy
From last week who I got into that argument
With - came back with his click
Muthafuckas in some deep shit
And so they asses got to pay
Make my way to a pay phone and hit J
""Hey, I just got jumped on

The mastermind of wreckin' shit, Mr. Scarface
The gangster of love, Willie D
Bushwick motherfuckin' Bill
And DJ Ready Red, the musical enforcer
Would form a family known as the Geto Boys

Still the, truth in the game ain't a damn thing changed
Prone to tote heat up and then shoot flames
Double the O.G. of a deuce thug thang
Bitches who know me know how I do dames
Still, fuckin with James we roll in this shit hard

Loaded and cocked, I'm known to be a block bleeder
Known to get paper and I ain't fin' to stop neither

Ranch got horses, golf courses and shit
Eat shrimp steak crab raw oysters and shit
And still fuck around with all my boys in the bricks

I can, cut it and bake, all I need is some soda, a plate
A microwave, Pyrex and a cake

I don't need to hold in court what I can hold in the streets

Two for the bitches wanna toss me up
Three for the people tryin to get my mail
Wanna send me to jail so they can lock me up

But I'll be standin in your bed receivin from your woman
You can bust in, but not while I'm cummin
Cause I'm cummin everywhere, in her hair, on her face
On her earring, even on the motherfuckin ceiling
Keep it playa with a playa, let me get my nut
After that, you can kill the bitch, I don't give a fuck
Yes indeed, Chuck smoke good weed

Some people slang 'caine, thinkin the money'll flow
But brothers gangbang, robbin people for dough
Get out the chain gang, or your freedom'll go
Stand on the sidewalks, with a fistful of crack
Watchin the guys talk, your boys watch your back
This game is dangerous, you're livin in fear
You pack a 9 for insurance to give the geekers a scare
He needs a 20, sell him a 10 and a half
And he'll be fiendin and dreamin you'll take his 20 and laugh
Continue slangin, makin all you can make
You hear a {*sirens*} that's the laws-gotta break
Hop in the Beemer, and roll up the glass
You put your car in reverse to make your getaway fast
Now they're suspicious - how could he be clean?
He packs a beeper, drives a Beemer, and he's only 19
Yo let's harass him, to see what he's got
What started off as a game ended the lives of 2 cops
Life in the fast lane
Another hot spot, you screech to a halt
Yo look what I've got, then reach for the wall
They find the product, and the cops'll say OHHHHHHH~!
They'll put your butt in the bump
Roll to the station, yo captain whassup?
I caught this brother on the cut, we gotta lock his butt up
Straight to the jail cell, no 9 or a clip
And the ones you triple-crossed'll want revenge so get hip
Out in an hour, on your way to the pad
A copper starts to trail you, now you're sweatin bad
Turn on his flashers, you stop Tommy Tucker
He stuck his head in the window so you shot him like a sucker
Fell to the pavement, blood pourin on the cement
There's witnesses standin by and you knew that he seen it
Back on the run again, and the boys on your block
Was blabbin all to the cops about the people you shot
Did you get nervous, well why continue your route?
When you know that normal folks don't chill with blood on their suits
Took off his jacket, flung to the back
Grabbin a pull from the pack, I gotta break I' get back
Right to his rock spot, before the brother got shot
He tried to sell 2 ki's to Tony that was filled full of sheet rock
Bumped off~! They ain't let him slide
Now his family's tryin to figure out the reason he died
... But that's the name of the game
Way he died was a shame, pushin 'caine
... ... Life in the fast lane
I remember fast times, sellin dope was my pastime
Life in the fast lane, while countin cash I'd
Sit back and wonder, what would become of me
The fiends would see the Beemer comin, and then they'd run to me
Step out the vehicle, yo what you need Joe?
I need a 20 and a nickel bag of weed bro
Make the sale then I'd bail out
Now it's time to get the hell out
Every day was the same thing, dopefiends named me
Big Crack Ak cause I sold 'caine mainly
Out of the big I had the biggest
Rocks on the block, so check it out yo money dig this
It was the purest in the rock form, the only way I sell it

And listen to the gangsta music
You got a Glock-10 in your lap but you're scared to use it
You's a motherfuckin stunt
Lettin all your homies know you bought another gun
Suppose they tried to pack you
Dropped your dick in the dirt, they'll know exactly how to send it at ya
Tryina work your way into the big clique

We Boogie,The Foundation,2005,"Gangsters don't dance pop, we boogie on some hard shit
Fuck the V.I.P., we buy the bar
And it's a party goin on, but we came in here to close it
Twenty niggas deep in the corner ready to roll shit
They dancin freaky, lookin sleazy as fuck
Ass bouncin everywhere, tryin to tease me with butt
But we ain't drinkin, we just chillin, we ain't sweatin these hoes
And I ain't here to answer questions, I'm just lettin you know
That if your cousin got a label or your partner can rap
Nigga cool, do your thizzle, give your partner some dap
But if you come up in this muh'fucker cappin in here
Man you ain't gon' believe what's fin' to happen in here
I'm a Southside nigga representin the good
For the North East and West side keepin it hood
Dirty wit it, I don't hesitate to put it to work
Pussy niggas on that bullshit get put in the dirt
So recognize what I be about, I'm mobbin for life
Geto Boys back together bitch, we squabbin tonight
Got the whole hood ridin cause we keepin it street
FaceMob, Chuck boogie, Willie D to the beat

We don't dance, we boogie - ride, we boogie
Ball, we boogie - shine, we boogie
So up jump the boogie, and straight hood boogie
I'm a real nigga gangsters don't dance, we boogie

Chuck Nice still in it, I ain't switchin it up
Weed smokin in the boys room, livin it up
Blue suits lookin stupid, I ain't givin a fuck
5th Ward, bloody nickel got me hittin it what
I'mma move it to the back, I wanna look at the show
See this chick I used to mash comin up through the do'
I approach her on some cool shit, I'm walkin her in
I'm in town for a minute and I'm wantin a friend
Fire up another phillie, steady feedin her lies
Eyes rollin to the back of her head, she was high
She was stupid like a snake, steady lickin her lips
{?} drugs up out the bird, so I pull out my dick
Started flashin at the party, I was drunk as a fuck
Full of weed, 'bout to conceive and twist it in public
'Til this chick walked in, said she's lovin the show
Started askin me to dance, I was tellin her noooooooo!


Walk through the do' and the DJ announce
Stop the motherfuckin music, Willie D in the house
He backed on it with my jam, that nigga was cool
He wasn't a bitch-ass ho like some of these fools
Keep the waitress on her toes, tipped her a bank
Northside niggas just love to crank
Does any one of y'all fools up in here got a gripe?
We kickin y'all motherfuckin ass tonight
Come at me sideways, I don't care if you law
I'm a dot that eye, and check that jaw
Dragged across the bar top partner
Slam you on the dance flo' and stomp the shit out ya
Somebody give me a drink to calm me down
It can be Wild Turkey, gin or Crown
I like 'em big, don't fuck with malnourished chicks
Now shake that ass you dirty bitch

Nigga! Side to side, drinkin hand, understand?
Y'all motherfuckin niggas be, backin that thang up, runnin hoppin
Whistle while you twerkin and, motherfuckin sissy-boyin

Damn it feel good to be a gangsta,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin' mouth
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showin' all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
And everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five ay-yo 24/7
Cuz real gangsta ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' prankstas
Is when the fry dies down what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Feedin' the poor and helpin' out wit they bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now I'm in the US makin' deals
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean one that you don't really know
Ridin' around town in a drop-top Benz
Hittin' switches in my black six-fo'
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangtsa here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eatin', cocksuckin' prankstas
When the ship jumps off what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangta-ass nigga knows the play
Real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Little Jake
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digit, take her out
And end up hitting that ass with the meat
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas
And everything is quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit you the shit
Hit the pen don't let the mothafuckas shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta
And now, a word from the President:
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin' voted into the White House
Everything lookin' good to the people of the world
But the mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
Like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans that helped me to win
I'd sincerely like to thank you
Cuz now I got the world swingin' from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-damn-it-feel-good-to-be-a-gangsta-lyrics

One Time Freestyle,Making Trouble,1988.0,"Yo, Johny C and Box, rock it freestyle, one time

The beat is pumpin, party's jumpin, makes you shakin the ground
Suckers starin while I'm darin you to try to get down
I'm controllin and I'm rollin out on any MC
He's not happy, that's a smile full of jealousy
Cold crushin and I'm dustin, leavin suckers behind
I could never be took, cause what's mine is mine
And I'm just realizin, I'm only hypnotizin
Girlies are in trance, breakin in cold sweat
When I snap my fingers you shall all snap out of it
I'm elevated, the greatness I've created
And I wanna thank God I finally made it
My beat is Uptown, no, I won't trade it
Makin big bucks and none's drug-related
My DJ's Ready Red, and he could never be imitated
So push 'power' and you'll hear the Grand Wizard fade it
Yo Box

The time has come that I serve and you observe
You wanna challenge competition, you lack the nerve
I'm your destruction and come prior to ya, you gotta accept
And I be makin cash money, you a demo cassette
With a killer-like motive and a four-wheel drive
Keep you punks lined up, everyone will survive
I know you steal from other rappers like a rat on the hunt
Therefore your rhyme is just ???, so yo, don't front
Juke Box the undisputed power house on the scene
Representin 5th Ward, not Hollis, Queens
But if you know we're from the country, crushin kamikazie
You ain't on my mission, break out, see I advise you
Break fool and terrorize everything in sight
And never scared to book em when you get uptight

Now I'm the prince of rhyme, and all of you cry
And I'm inspired by the beat and all you suckers who try
To defeat the undefeated Johny C has the mind
To destroy the wonderboy, and any of mankind
Cause I'm never caught slippin, performance is tipped and
Like a hoe your ride my jock, I might as well start pimpin
Lyrics of destruction, invincible song
Runnin from the prince of rap, though I'm King-Kong
Cause I'm shakin the nation, tearin down every tank
Only once I lost a battle, then I broke the sucker neck
It was an MC named (Toy) he was a dumb-ass (boy)
Disc Jockey farted as he charged to defeat the McCoy
I'm a rhyming rap wizard, rhymes are like venom
Bite em, you'll die, and I just say ""to hell with him""
Why should I care for you suckers out there
Shoot you down in every battle, you still scream ""unfair!""
Time for a rumble in this concrete jungle
Whiz that take a quiz, shoot you down in one bundle
My rhymes are motivating, your body responds
With the center party people gettin funky for mine
I'm a rapper, I'm through with ya, posse (tug of war)
We're confiscating (and raiding) and still the Boys are hardocre
Rrrah

Juke Box, the rhyme performer performin a rhyme
I'm like the sun, muthafucka, now watch me shine
Spread light across the land, cause I'm the man
The original party rocker of an Uptown jam
You know my style will never fade, you punks get slayed
I'm intendin to rock, there's money to be made
The undisputed rap pro keepin you on the go
Purchase, go buy a ticket to see my show
Because I made a lot of cash, we took you fast
But now you're jockin the Box and I don't need your dumb ass
One time

Yo Johny C and Box, man
I want y'all to just chill out, man
Gimme the mic, man
I'ma show you how y'all rock this thing one time, man
Y'all know how to rock a Uptown jam
Let's me show you what's up here, man
You know what I'm sayin?
Grand Wizard DJ Red in effect
Word, bust this

My home is where I roam, turntable's my peace
And in creation is a masterpiece
Because my music's my mind, cuttin breaks with rhymes
Snappin fingers, clappin hands, shakin behinds
Tearin up the place with the beats galore
Within my own world, we're no amateurs
Because I stayed in my room till my knowledge improved
Got busy tryin to catch the groove
You know I cut and scratched till I get it right
So now I rock a party morning, noon and night
You know I be jammin with my musical skill
My hands are deadly on the wheels of steel

If anybody come lookin' for him, tell him he gone

Can't you see his muthafuckin thighs humpin' the ground

I've never been played by a ho!
If the bitch is acting stupid
She's got to go!
Some muthafuckers get sad
If she fucks with me, I'ma kick her little monkey ass!
See you hoes got it wrong!
Think since a nigga say he loves ya, he ain't strong
Bitch you takin' shit the wrong way
And I can tell right now. It's gonna be a long day!
Bushwick Bill
I got to educate you brothas
If the bitch won't give up the play
Fuck her!
Move along to the next trick
See I'm the type a nigga that tell a ho
""suck dick!""
What if she's not suckin'
That's a waste of time, conversation and my fuckin'
I just put my fuckin pants on
And tell the idiotic freak
To take her tramp ass home!
Scarface
Cause I don't need a fuckin dummy
I need a bitch to lick nuts
Until my dick is cummin'
And after that, you'll earn your gloves
HA HA... Just call me the gangster of love
Willie D
I like bitches
All kind of bitches
To take off my shirt
And pull down my britches
If shes got big tities
I squeeze 'em and hold'em
While she suck my dick and lick my scrotum
Bushwick Bill
And If she got a friend I'll fuck her too
Together we can play a game of switcheroo
I ain't the type who gets all mushy
I like to sit back
And watch them eat each other's pussy!
Weak people might say we're insane
But that's the other fuckin' level of the game
I'll turn your sister out if she fucks with me
You want to know my identity???
Bushwick Bill
Bitches look at me like I'm a faker
Knowing goddamn well
I'm a mutherfuckin heartbreaker!
I'll have them crying for months
Cause I done fucked their best friends
And put a whipping on their cunt
They have their mothers to call
But, if you fucked one mom
You done fucked them all
And I really don't give a fuck
Cause if your mom offers me the pussy
She's stuck
Scarface
Now thats the type of nigga I am
I'm always game to run a train, god-damn...
Six different hoes a night
I use lubricated rubbers, to make the pussy feel right
Better safe then be a victim
If ya got a jimmy hat, go ahead and dick em
I put the pussy in its place
And right before i nut, i pull it out, then to the face
And tell the bitch to keep suckin
And prepare herself for her first butt fuckin
Then when i'm done, straight to the tub, haha...
Just call me the Gangster of Love
Willie D
I'm a mother fucker, i put a bitch to the test
If she dont pass, she dont get blessed
If the test consists, of fucking my whole crew
Then bitch, god-damn, thats what you gotta do
You say you wanna be down with Willie-D
But yet you find it difficult to listen to me
Everytime you fuck up and skip a class
Imma put my god-damn foot in your ass
Scarface
And if your father wants to buck-up
I'll beat the wrinkles out that old mothafucka
I treat a bitch like a queen
But she has to realize I'm the goddamn king
Bushwick Bill
Some jealous punk in town
Told my girl i was fucking around, and she's still down
To do the same, you gotta have game
You wanna know my name?
Say bill
Wassup B
All the hoes mad at us cause we ain't paying for the pussy
And fighting over their asses and shit
AHAHAHA
But thats the other level of the game again
Damn straight
Say man, while we on the subject of hoes
What ever happened to that hoe you used to fuck with named cathy
Bushwick Bill
Oh cathy, that hoe was hot
The first piece of pussy that i ever got
She fucked me til i was cummin
Put my nuts in her mouth, and started hummin
I said, shit, um its ejecting
She started scratching my dillbag and said hold up a second
Turn me over on my back gold
Opened up my butt cheeks and started lickin out my asshole
Thats why i guess that im the gangsta
And oh ya, cathleen johnson, sweetheart, i'd like to thank ya
Scarface
Little hoes out there are getting stuck
By niggas like me and we really dont give a fuck
Big ass titties and a sexy switch
Whatever you got, you deserved it bitch
Willie D
See, ah, i like to take em fast
Act like i love em, and dog ther mothafuckin ass
Like for instance miss P
The bitch ran a game and tried to fuck over me
But i assisted in the makin
Talking bout she pregnant
""For you or that jamaican""?
She said me of course
So i drug her little ass like a mother fuckin horse
Thats what you get for trying to play me
I'll kick a bitch smack dead in the ass, if she ever say we
Made a kid when i make it
I'll grab her by her motherfuckin' neck
And try to break it!
Cause I knew I wore a fucking glove
You know who you fuckin with bitch???

So I picked up the phone, and got ready to go
Climbed out the window real slow and low soooo
Listen cause I'm only gonna say it - one time
Mom I'm not comin in that's final - next line
Keep the motor runnin, moms on my back
It's like that, to be exact, and that's a fact
NO CURFEW~! WE DON'T WANT NO CURFEW~!
BREAK!
Curfews are what every kid debates
Yo and all we hear is olds mom say
Here lately I've been watching you
You're comin in my house at 1 and 2
Now backing out of the door, I can hear her say
Be back by 12 okay?
NO CURFEW~! WE DON'T WANT NO CURFEW~!",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-no-curfew-lyrics
Damn it feels good 2 be a gangsta,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 1
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin mouth
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showin' all his boys how he shot em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em
And everythings cool in the mind of a gangsta
Cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five a year 24/7
Cause real gangsta ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' prankstas
Cause when the fry dies down what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 2
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Feedin' the poor and hepin out wit they bills
Although I was born in jamaica
Now I'm in the us makin' deals
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean one that you don't really know
Ridin' around town in a drop-top benz
Hittin' switches in my black six-fo'
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangtsa here is a smart one
Started living for the lord and I'll last
Now all I gotta say to you

When the shit jumps off what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 3
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangta-ass nigga knows the play
Real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga little jake
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of little miss sweet
But catch the bitch all alone get the digit take her out
And then dump-hittin' the ass with the meat
Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas
And everythings quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let the mothafuckas shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 4
And now, a word from the president!
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin voted into the white house
Everything lookin good to the people of the world
But the mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
Like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
Cause now I got the world swingin' from my nuts

Wearin gold cause I'm bold with the rappin disease
Terrorize sucker rappers with these rhymes I wrote
Superior damage unleashed by the case I told
I'm feelin lyrics to display the funky rhymes I say
Opponents better be around when I claim my day
Although my rhyme's complete would you forgive my conceit
And only practice ( ? ) a true man's beat
Yo, before I start breakin let me stake my place
Holder of a high position, lord of all this bass
Rippin suckers like paper cause they're just that soft

You might not be a sucker but I run this

Ready Red, break it down

To all you police who try to diss
You just might be the law but I run this

Say yo, baby doll, hear what you say
That you work real hard each and every day
And all I do is sit around

You buy my clothes, supply the food
But you're the girl and I'm the dude
You take care of me and that is it
You might be my girl but I run this

Pushin out of straightjackets, and suckers can't hack it
You say one lyric sire will attack it
Gladiator of records, amputator of wax
And I'm slicin them up, like a ninja in black

Seniority over all, supreme assistant to no

Intro (Till Death Do Us Part),Till Death Do Us Part,1993.0,"Ah yeah…
Yeah, this is Lil J and the Geto Boys in this mutha once again
And we kicked the door in just like I told you we would in ’91 and ‘92
But you know, there’s a lot of people mad about our success
Such as the DEA, IRS, and other wicked people in high places
You know, when I was growing up, people used to tell me how dirty the system was
But I refused to be controlled by an ungodly system
So now they’re mad, and I’ma tell you why
I was born in the ghetto, but I didn’t allow myself to be systemized by the welfare system and poverty that they try to handicap us with in the ghetto
I worked my ass off, I pulled brothers off the street
And together, we built a multi-million-dollar record company in a few years
I did it the way it was supposed to be done
By hiring lawyers and accountants, make sure everything is done legally
But there’s still one problem: I’m Black
So, those people whom I referred to earlier feel like I’ve done something wrong
And escaped all the traps they set for us in the ghetto
They really are upset with me for helping my brother get off the street
Yeah, they were getting down for theirs—you know what I mean
Doing what they had to do to survive
So you know what they say? Those guys at Rap-A-Lot must be doing something wrong
Because it’s no way a group of niggas from the ghetto can run a multi-million-dollar business
But see, it’s all a conspiracy against ghetto boys all over the world to keep  down
But you know what? It’s our time, and we can’t be stopped
Until death do us apart
So keep supporting Rap-A-Lot, because they only kind of dope we’re selling
Is dope CD’s and cassettes
Yo, Bido, Scarface, Big Mike, and Bushwick
Here’s some of that ghetto dope processed in 5th Ward Texas",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-intro-till-death-do-us-part-lyrics
6 ft. deep,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There's far too many of you dying
June, 28 was the date 38
Till the chest plate mommy dear's cryin' at the wake
And everybody's dressed up in black suits
Goin' to pay their last respects to the black troop
Why'd he have to die is the question that we're under
But everyone knows that everyday's a different number
So when your time comes, just remember G
You'll always have a place in this world as a memory
Especially my boys who passed away back in '92
Best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
Wherever we go, wherever we be, we be thinkin'
Of how we hung in the clubs smokin' and drinkin'
Never missin' out on a hood fight
'Cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
Everything is changed and people are lookin' lonely
It's gonna be strange spendin' New Year's eve without your homie
But ain't much that we can do
Except pour brew throughout the crew
To make sure we all remember you
And believe me it hurts
To see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt, dirt
There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying
Another homie got smoked but it's no surprise
Everybody's trippin' 'cause the boy was too young to die
A sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
Everybody's trippin' 'cause they can't accept my homie's death
Another killin' was reported on the evenin' news
Somebody's brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
In the midst of all this shit I think about myself
Wonderin' when somebody's gonna try to take me off the shelf
But I refuse to be another violent casualty
So when I'm rollin', I pack my pistol grip beside my knee
'Cause on the city streets today a brother jus' can't win
When the people you think are your friends
Really ain't your friends, uh and bush wick can't sleep
When everybody aroun' me keeps fallin' six feet deep
There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying
The pain that's deep inside of everybody grows
As they approach to see the body before the casket close
The person standin' next to me has snapped the flip
Once I seen the casket closed I knew that that was it
The whole entire family spoke on his defense
The choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
And durin' all the singing I broke down myself
When I looked and seen the family that my partner left
And then the choir broke into it's final song
Thinkin' to myself the worst is yet to come
Everyone was headed for the final flight
As we creeped along the gravel on the burial sight
The director said his words and there was not a sound
As they lower my little partner  inside the ground
Everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
And then they work alone with the concrete block and that's deep
There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying
A lotta homies die, a lotta mothers cry
I watch tears fall down from their eyes
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
But nobody wants to take the chance
They chose the music so they had to dance
Couldn't tell 'em nothin' was a player, had ta have it
Got caught up in the game now ma boy's in the casket
And everybody's lookin' for somebody else to blame
Ashamed to let his mother know that he was in a gang
We used to kick it on the Ave at night
Comin' up tryin' to have the finer things in life
But now my boys gone, I wish he was at home
I wish he wouldn't a never fell victim to the clone
So when I drink a brew for you, I pour some on the block, son
You might be gone but you damn sure ain't forgotten
So on remember whenever or wherever
Dead or alive real partners come together, and you know that
There's far too many of you dying
There's far too many of you dying",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-6-ft-deep-lyrics

Made me you made me
We was living on cold facts cops sat in old lacs
Couldn't get along with T. Jones so he rolled
Jack I was on prozac before I was twelve spent
My senior year in high school sitting in jail
To no avail I was screaming out and nobody
Heard messed around and got shot but it didn't
Deter me think I was 14 so my boy was one tray
Cut my hair one day left my crib and got sprayed
And expired right away nothin to say said chapter
Around here either we get killed or we get captured
Sister girl I ain't know what you was dealing with
Pointed my finger and you and I'm feeling like an
Idiot but I'm wiser now and I seen the world it's
Messed up how they treat us ghetto boys and girls
The doctor tried to recessitate but it was too late
I got A daughter named kain and A son named blank
And they be askin bout you all the time I try to
Be A better man sometimes I fall behind so if you
Feel some extra weight on you don't be alarmed don't
Move don't flee that's me leaning on you
If you move I'll fall I'm leaning on you you made me
You made me
Yall wonder why I act crazy life don't phase me for me
To still be above ground it's just amazing wasn't aware
Being different gave me intangible wealth that's why I
Took A gun and tried to kill myself my folks got the
Blame of course I used to ask why did god make my
Brother so tall and me A dwarf this ain't no poor
Little me song that's so phony I got A good life I'm
Just sharin my testimony but could you imagine being me
For 1 hour 1 day 1 week 1 month 1 year get out of here
You'd never make it life's not fair where ever you go
People point people laugh people stare they don't care
So I don't care most of the day I feel awkward but believe
I'm going to hell if I don't pray as I lay on that hospital
Gurney fightin for my life I felt the demons touch my body
And I saw the light that was you I know it was you cause
All the love in the world from my family couldn't pull me
Through lord when it gets really rough you're the only one
That's strong enough to hold me up
If you move I'll fall I'm leaning on you you made me you

I don't wanna (run) run no more, but I know that if I stop
I'll be another nigga headed to heaven, hangin' with 'Pac
These motherfuckers look at me like I'm a slanger
Makin threats to my family, dog I'm in danger
Who do you call when these agents want you dead
And they hit these penitentiaries and niggas make a pledge
So I dip and duck the feds, all my homies stuck out on indictments
Caught up on the phone, talkin' prices (hello)
25-to-life's the mandatory minimal
My whole community gets treated like they criminals
Why are them bitches gettin' motherfuckers hung
Got a C.I. on the inside and everybody's sung
Mothers and fathers seperated from they sons
Households are broken, you couldn't hold your tongue
If it's yours, say it's yours, take the case, do your time

Now you cryin' in your jail cell, stressin' on the case

See I be on some street shit, don't talk to police
I won't accept a visit from agents who wanna see
If I got shit to say about a nigga case
I'm a motherfuckin' nigga through and through, I ain't gay
Know a nigga caught a case and he took his 25
Sat it out on appeal, and gave him back that time
A soldier in his mind and his actions said the same
Told a cracker tell your mommy suck his dick and see Rick James
Ain't no motherfuckin' game, we been livin' this for real
When the government is workin', real niggas never squeal
Right here the truth revealed, Troy you a mouse
Yeah you rappin' but the homey Lil' Pots can't get out
Niggas they hit the pen, they get charged, then get out
On a rule, 35, he a bought it for the cops

Damn It Feels Good to Be a Gangsta by Geto Boys,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 1
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin mouth
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showin' all his boys how he shot em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas know they got em
And everythings cool in the mind of a gangsta
'cause gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five a year 24/7
'cause real gangsta ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' prankstas
'cause when the fry dies down what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 2
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Feedin' the poor and hepin out wit they bills
Although I was born in jamaica
Now I'm in the us makin' deals
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean one that you don't really know
Ridin' around town in a drop-top benz
Hittin' switches in my black six-fo'
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangtsa here is a smart one
Started living for the lord and I'll last
Now all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eatin' cocksuckin' prankstas
When the shit jumps off what the fuck you gonna do
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 3
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangta-ass nigga knows the play
Real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga little jake
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of little miss sweet
But catch the bitch all alone get the digit take her out
And then dump-hittin' the ass with the meat
'cause gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas
And everythings quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
'cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit do the shit
Hit the pen and let the mothafuckas shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
'cause damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Verse 4
And now, a word from the president!
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin voted into the white house
Everything lookin good to the people of the world
But the mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
Like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you republicans, that helped me win
I sincerely like to thank you
'cause now I got the world swingin' from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta

Be Down,UnKnown,UnKnown,"From Brooklyn New York I'm down with Brother Radee
Trenton's the land of truth, I'm down with Waduski
I'm down with J from Houston and I think you should know
That when I'm down in LA I'm down with Harry-O
Now undercover runnin from the mafios
My boy was makin ill moves and no one ever knows
A long white Lincoln pulls up, says, ""Yo""
My boy said, ""Hey, what's up bro""
They asked a question, he said, ""No""
Out comes the chauffeur, I stepped back to observe
If he was down he'da told me, I watched my boy get served
A few nights later we rocked a show, get paid
So we can take a trip to Houston and be down with J
Made our reservations and the very next day
Received a call sayin, ""Johnny man, it got away""
Crackheads, no, you could never trust 'em
Not even if it's your brother or your very best friend
Cause they wanna be down, try to be down
But still can get you shot down
Over a 5 or a 10, yo
You gotta be down, you gotta be down
You gotta be down, you gotta be down
Word
You gotta be down, you gotta be down
Now if you gonna be down, then be down
Word

He had serious intentions on bein a star
Fame was his name and he planned to go far
I knew it would happen, but never thought it was you
Preached Balls and My Word and still deserted the crew
But now you're lost in the sauce and your talent would leave ya
And now that I'm on top I'm gonna damn sure tease ya
Way down beneath is where he's gonna send ya
Cause you're nothin but a liar and a ( ? )
You thought we'd never make it, to you that's how it seemed
But now I'm high and rockin from believin in dreams
Box is down with rock 'n roll and I'm with the league
Hardcore champ and my bullets received
Ghetto Boys is a posse and I'm down because I wanna be
Billy is a man, pinch his cheek, freak, and you will be down
But only on the ground spittin out sand
Forget it, Red is sharp, man, he's cuttin like a sword
Jersey boys are jealous cause we're down with 5th Ward
Some say we're traitors cause it's not our hometown
But it's hittin and fittin and like I said you gotta be down
Word, Grand Wizard, enter with a breakdown

Now he was brought up in the ghetto, taught to be a bad kid
Never thought twice about the things he did
Robbed a lot of stores and had never been caught
Until now - still say it wasn't his fault
He had a homebody and cuz said he was deep
He'll meet him on a spot about a quarter to three
The plan was to rob a small store named Pops
It was in the neighborhood, no one has ever seen cops
Approached the destination and his boy got afraid
Never knew a man who was scared to get paid
Looked into his eyes and all he saw was regret
Grabbed his gun and said, ""You're ready?"" Shook his hand, he said, ""Bet""
Wheels started screamin, lights started flashin
He panicked, saw the cops, then down the alley started dashin
They gave chase, he missed out on the cut
3:30 on the dot, Pops' wife was lockin up
Ramshacked the door, the old lady dropped
Pulled out his gun, said, ""Where's the money, Pops?""
They tried to play Spanish like they didn't understand
(No English! No English!)
Dugged into her bra and pulled out at least a grand
Movin fast Pops sweatin and red
He said, ""( ? ), make a move and you're dead""
Bust him cross the head with a bottle of wine
Loaded up his pockets in his Louis Vuitton
Ran outside and all he heard was, ""Boy, freeze!""
Reached for the sky, fell to his knees
Threw down the gun and towards the law he started draggin
Handcuffed, beaten down and thrown into the wagon
On the corner smokin cheeb' supposed to be down ( ? Dale ? )
He said, ""I thought about it, man, and I'm not down with goin to jail""
Cause robbin and stealin is not the way that we're livin
And to be down with the Boys you gotta be down with givin
Cause there's joy in our hearts, we're really all about peace
So if you see a crook in action, be down and call the police
Yo
Come on
You gotta be down, you gotta be down
You gotta be down, you gotta be down

You gotta be down, you gotta be down
Now if you gonna be down, then be down

Nothin’ To Show,The Foundation,2005,"I'll be damned if I'ma live without it
I'm penitentiary real until the day I die
I'll pull a f*ckin heist.. snatch away your f*ckin life
Shake the dice, sell rocks, flip bricks
Print up some motherf*ckin counterfeit
It's too cold
When you made a big knot and your heartbeat stops
And they throw you in a box and you ain't got nothin to show
They say the first law of nature, is self-preservation
F*ck a PlayStation, my bills don't vacation
Got a mac-11, holdin up a bankin center
If they follow my instructions, they might make it home for dinner
Cake-ass nigga in the club, bottle poppin
.. make me wanna pop him, heh
He bought a drink, flashed his knot, now he dearly departed
Broke as I was, that nigga had to be retarded
Stung him in the cabbage with that semi-automatic
Jacked his chain and his watch, and rifled through his {?}
I'll kill ya dead, rich or po', grown or a youngster
I ain't Cody Scott, but I can be a +Monster+
Call me a sinner, but know what's funny?
So is the dude that you give your money to on Sundays
Like my grandmother, she paid her tithe, sold her place and picked up folks
For the church and died broke, with nothin to show
You can talk that hot shit if you want to
But it don't tell me what you won't do
When you're down on your luck and nobody gives a f*ck
Bill collectors on your heels and they repo'n your wheels
I done had money, been broke and had it again
Anythang I do twice, I can do it again
Look how many niggas who done sold drugs all this time
That's doin a bunch of years are back in the hood and ain't got a dime
Ain't no excuse for it, go on be a man and admit it
That come from cappin, buyin cars and trickin bitches
I ain't tryin to knock your hustle homey, that ain't cool
But get your money, clean it up, and get the f*ck on fool
Cause your friends just wanna stunt and these hoes just want your bread
And the fed is gonna hunt and these niggas'll blow your head
Behind beef, or a fake say, dude knew your face
So you murdered him, but ain't got nothin to show
I'll be God damned if I'ma be that old nigga that live
60 plus years and leave nothin but bills
""Mind Playin Tricks"" still playin on the box
And I'm sittin on the porch in sweats and some mismatched dress socks
Yeah right! Before I go out like a busta
I get all my f*ckin guns and kill ALL you motherf*ckers
I ain't gon' be that cat that's broke so he blows his brain
I'ma be the one to kill the armored truck driver if anythang
F*ck the fame I want the dough cause when times get drastic
You cain't take a f*ckin ego to the bank and cash it
I'm not impressed with your big house and expensive whip
If you can't pay cash you can't afford the shit
They say heaven got what I'm needin, but just in case it don't exist
I'm gettin my flowers while I'm breathin
But ain't gon' be like Sammy Davis and Redd Foxx
When Willie D check up out this bitch he goin out on top
I told you, I was gon' give you somethin to think about
Shit, even if I f*ck off all the money I made
Nigga I'ma still God damn be paid at the end
Cause guess what? Got that life insurance policy, hahaha
Shit that motherf*cker there's, better than playin the lottery
You guaranteed to hit
Babies they can come up like instant millionaires
I tell you right now my baby's an instant millionaire
Nigga you understand what I'm sayin?
Some of y'all sucka busta ass nigga
Y'all don't understand that kind of shit
Y'all like, worry about the bitch
Spendin the money on this nigga and that nigga and all this shit
Nigga drivin your car, livin in your house

C'MON~! Play pussy, get FUCKED!
Asshole speak, you get beat
You're a bad motherfucker if you dare to compete
Cause Diana Ross'll be comin out your ass fool
... and have you singin the blues
Tall lil' figure by the pound, let's go a round
I'mma take ya, shake ya, and break you down
And if you kick, I'mma pick up a stick
And beat your ass to the size of your dick
And that's small! And you think you're mackin
While you lackin, Bushwick is packin
I'll show your girl how a real man feels
Large things come in very small packages
And while you're gettin on your knees to fuck
A nigga like me's still standin up
Any bitch, will tell ya
As long as he has a big dick, size ain't shit!

Yo Bushwick Bill man, show these ho-ass motherfuckers out here in the game man
That you're too short to take a motherfuckin short

Liftin weights'll make you bigger

Money, more money
I've got to get my hands on some

Lemonheads don't quote, I ain't with bein broke
I'm tired of my mother bustin up for other folks
Gettin nowhere tough
While the freak on the corner makin mo' money sellin bucks!
I ain't with this outfit
I gotta make some moves to buy G Jones some nice gifts
Before she kill herself, workin on a job all week
That don't even make the ends meet
I walk down Main Street
Growls in my stomach cause I ain't had nuttin to eat
So how the hell am I gon' thank?
When I'm in a funky sweatsuit and Silk joying to mink
Her coat is tooken out puttin non-stop
Make the swap and go shop
I said that to say this and every note
I ain't with being broke!

Money, more money
Got to get my hands on some
Money, more money
Got to get my hands on some

I was BORN in a run dime hospital
Brought to 5th Ward, stuffed right in the middle
Of a rock and a hard spot
Before my dad, met my mom I was already counted out
Mmm, What a pity
Momma couldn't afford milk so we had to suck her
In the kitchen every night I would see
Rats and roaches eatin better than me
There was no Thanksgiving
They say I'm a fool for thanking God for living
But bein broke ain't no Eddie Murphy joke
Well out in '91 is just ain't happenin bro
I never had a damn thing
Christmas came and went, without a choo-choo train
In the ghettos gifts get stole or bought
Ain't nobody Named Santa Claus!

Money, more money
I've got to get my hands on some, sweet mo-neyyyy
Money, more money
I've got to get my hands on some

Let the gunshots RANG OUT, Go Ahead blow my BRAINS OUT
If you've been there, you know what I'm talkin about
Gettin over tops my agenda
The easy way out, is to jump out of a window
But that's a dopefiend move gone left
I'll hurt you, but not MYSELF
I tried to do the right things major
But that didn't put no food on the table
Went back to school to get my G.E.D
But who's gonna hire a dropout like me?
... McDonald's don't fit
They work you like a dog plus they talk too much lip!
Without them dollar signs
It's like livin and dyin at the same time
And you wonder why a another brother sell dope?
He ain't with being broke!

Money, more money
I've got to get my hands on some, yeahhhh
Money, more money
I've got to get my hands on some, sweet sweet

Let A Ho Be A Ho (GB Version),The Geto Boys,1990,"(Yo D man what's up with that cash register shit?)
Oh that's what the average ho see everytime she look at a modern day man
(Ain't that the motherfuckin truth)
Yeah~! And these old fickle-minded ass niggas
Wonder why a ho be with them one day and another goofy motherfucker the next
(I think it's time you kicked some more of that shit D)
Yeahhhhhhhhhh!

It seems to be a lot of motherfuckers blind to the fact
That a ho is gonna be just that
And this type of ignorance is the very
Reason why so many niggas in the God damn cemetery
Intelligence is on call
You don't treat a ho like a queen, who behaves like a dog
Are you the type who won't put a ho in front of a trigger?
Then youse a hoe ass nigga
God damn hound, pound for pound
You knew the ho when she was fuckin' the whole town
She fucked you and gave your buddies a blow
But your trick ass fell in love with the ho
Tried to change her, make her be an angel
You keep puttin' your damn life in danger
Frontin' niggas about that slutty-ass triflin' crow
You gotta let a ho be a ho!

She's a ho (D, how the fuck you know?)
Every time I see the ho she's with a new negro
She's the kind of ho that's bound
To wear shorts up her ass when your friends come around
The kind of ho that'll make you cry
The kind of ho you have to call, before you come by
So why you wanna kill when she says no more?
You ain't the first to be dumped by a God damn whore!
Crazy motherfuckers fightin' over hoes
Stealin' for they asses and jumpin' out of windows
If a ho want out, I let her stanky ass go
Cause I'ma let a ho be a ho
Now do y'all follow me so motherfuckin far? (YEAH!!)
(Hell yeah I remember I let this ho named Kim use my car, man)
(Bitch went to go see another nigga; I damn near killed that ho!)
Ha ha I fucked that ho man! (You motherfuckin lie)
That's bullshit, ask Bush.. man ask Bushwick and Red!
{He went up in that bitch man}
{On the f'realla my nigga}
Akshen, man, I'm tellin' you, man!

I fucked that ho, before you even knew her
Made her pussy go when I stuck my dick to it
I knew she was a ho the first time I met her
So I got another ho and took her to the other level
Of the game, got them high as a kite
And fucked BOTH of those hoes that God damn night!
Then I sat back and relaxed
As they 69'd, and ate each other's cat
I dropped them off at home
God damn, look at this shit, my wallet's gone!
The hoes beat me but I left it alone
And used that shit as a stepping stone
I played it off the next time I saw the ho
I just laughed and fucked her ass some mo'
She licked my ass, and sucked my balls
And if I see her right now I can get them drawers

Yeah buddy! Willie D ain't gonna let these hoes get him down
I ain't cryin or dyin over none of you hoes
I ain't buyin you no leather, I ain't buyin you no suedes
No jewelry, no contacts, no Lee nails
Ain't buy you no hair, no makeup, food
None of that good shit (tell 'em, D!)",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-let-a-ho-be-a-ho-gb-version-lyrics
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta - single version,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangsta-ass nigga plays his cards right
A real gangsta-ass nigga never runs his fuckin' mouth
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas don't start fights
And niggas always gotta high cap
Showin' all his boys how he shot 'em
But real gangsta-ass niggas don't flex nuts
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas know they got 'em
And everything is cool in the mind of a gangsta
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas think deep
Up three-sixty-five ay-yo 24/7
Cuz real gangsta ass niggas don't sleep
And all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, cocksuckin', pussy-eatin' prankstas
Is when the fry dies down what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Feedin' the poor and helpin' out wit they bills
Although I was born in Jamaica
Now I'm in the US makin' deals
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
I mean one that you don't really know
Ridin' around town in a drop-top Benz
Hittin' switches in my black six-fo'
Now gangsta-ass niggas come in all shapes and colors
Some got killed in the past
But this gangtsa here was a smart one
Started living for the Lord and I'll last
Now all I gotta say to you
Wannabe, gonnabe, pussy-eatin', cocksuckin' prankstas
When the ship jumps off what the fuck you gonna do?
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
A real gangta-ass nigga knows the play
Real gangsta-ass niggas get the flyest of the bitches
Ask that gangsta-ass nigga Little Jake
Now bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign
And play the role of Little Miss Sweet
But catch the bitch all alone, get the digit, take her out
And end up hitting that ass with the meat
Cuz gangsta-ass niggas be the gang playas
And everything is quiet in the clique
A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger
And his partners in the posse ain't tellin' off shit
Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much
All ya hear is the black from the gun blast
And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit
Cuz real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast
Now when you in the free world talkin' shit you the shit
Hit the pen don't let the mothafuckas shank ya
But niggas like myself kick back and peep game
Cuz damn it feels good to be a gangsta
And now, a word from the President:
Damn it feels good to be a gangsta
Gettin' voted into the White House
Everything lookin' good to the people of the world
But the mafia family is my boss
So every now and then I owe a favor gettin' down
Like lettin' a big drug shipment through
And send 'em to the poor community
So we can bust you know who
So voters of the world keep supportin' me
And I promise to take you very far
Other leaders better not upset me
Or I'll send a million troops to die at war
To all you Republicans that helped me to win
I'd sincerely like to thank you
Cuz now I got the world swingin' from my nuts
And damn it feels good to be a gangsta",https://genius.com/Geto-boys-damn-it-feels-good-to-be-a-gangsta-single-version-lyrics
