Design in Malice,Violence Begets Violence,2011.0,"If I don't have the mag I get a bastard stabbed
With a knife big as a claw of an Alaskan crab
Young, I'm down with Vinnie give me six weeks
All y'all little pipsqueaks is up shit's creek
Think we a joke? I'll put three in your throat
Drunk off gin and C&C coke then we flee in a boat
Then I come open up the spot with Coconut Ciroc
So the hoes'll suck some cock
Then I'll forget to call her, after the nut I get attention deficit disorder
1-5 catch us off X's and dust
Whole clique of registered sex offenders
Pop shit, we'll hold your funeral XVIs
Niggas' money come in Roman numerals
Your block slow now, she fuck with them rappers
Cause y'all niggas' money took a muscle relaxer

I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time

Our music's strong enough to stop a bomb
I'm putting pressure on you kids like I'm a soccer mom
Who you think idea that it was to stop Saddam?
Who you think idea that was to drop the bomb?
You get your shit rocked ma like Mustafa song
You blowing smoke you motherfucker, you should cop a bong
The nine Taurus jam a little bit, the Glock is strong
I move brutal and use voodoo like Papa Shango
Over a billion Muslims, you could never stop Islam
Over a billion bullets shooting from the chopper's arm
The backstage filled with liquor and a lot of traum'
Cause it's been hard on Vinnie since my father gone
I'm about to blow the fucking horns like it was Rosh Hashanah
This is the calm before the storm, Armageddon's on
Carry a motherfucker head that I shred in 'Nam
I speak literally, figuratively, the prophet gone

I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time
I'm the mastermind with a faster rhyme
It's work, not how I pass the time

You don't have to search and question
I have the purse and the murder weapon
Never get a second chance to make a first impression
I'm no virgin to murder and I'm an urban legend
Rather be of real service than to serve in Heaven
I don't like cops, I don't like co-operators
I don't like traitors or story corroborators
In any problem I'm the common denominator
My behaviour is the product of intoxicators
I'm just blood addicted, it's the other liquid
I'm above the limit off of the blood of the wicked
Don't even ask, there's somebody in the body bags
The blood matches what's on the hatchets and hockey mask
I'm never traumatized, I don't have to compromise
I don't have to economize the homicides
You tell Jesus to take the wheel, my faith is nil
I believe that even Jesus has a way to kill",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-design-in-malice-lyrics
Uncommon Valor: A Vietnam Story,"Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell",2006.0,"I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this nation. I have always tried to do what was best. (Duck… and cover!)

I don't know why I'm over here, this job is evil
They sent me here to Vietnam to kill innocent people
My mother wrote me, said: ""The President, he doesn't care.""
He tryin' to leave the footprints of America here
They say we tryin' to stop Chinese expansion
But I ain't seen no Chinese since we landed
Sent my whole entire unit, thinkin' we could win
Against the Vietcong guerrillas there in Gia Định
I didn't sign up to kill women or any children
For every enemy soldier, we killin' six civilians
Yeah, and it ain't right to me
I ain't got enough of motherfuckin' fight in me
It frightens me, and I just wanna see my son and moms
But over here they droppin' seven million tons of bombs
I spent my days dodgin' all these booby-traps and mines
And at night prayin' to God that I get back alive
And I'm forced to sit back and wonder
Why I was a part of Operation Rolling Thunder
In a foxhole with nine months left here
Jungle like the fuckin' harbinger of death here

I don't wanna be here, I'm scared, I just wanna go home
You fucking kidding me?! Don't be a pussy!
Don't you love your country?!
I like being here, I'm ready (True story…)

Call me Thorburn, John A., staff sergeant
Marksman, skilled in killin', illin', I'm able and willin'
Kill a village elephant, rapin' and pillage a village
Illegitimate killers, U.S. Military guerrillas
This ain't no real war, Vietnam shit
World War II, that's a war, this is just a military conflict
Soothin' drug abusin', Vietnamese women screwin'
Sex, gamblin' and boozin' — all this shit is amusin'
Bitches and guns, this is every man's dream
I don't wanna go home where I'm just an ordinary human being
Special Op, Huey chopper gun ship, run shit
Gook run when the minigun spit, won't miss
Kill shit, spit four-thousand bullets a minute
Victor Charlie, hair-trigger, hit it, I'm in it to win it
Get it, the lieutenant hinted, the villain, I been it
The killin', I did it, cripple, did it
Pictures I painted is vivid, live it
A wizard with weapons: the secret mission, we 'bout to begin it
Government funded, behind enemy lines
Bullets is sprayin', it's heatin' up a hundred degrees
The enemy's the North Vietnamese, bitch please!
Ain't no sweat, I'm told be at ease
Until I see the pilot got hit, and we 'bout to hit some trees
Tail rotor broke, crash land
American man in Cambodia, right in the enemy hand
Take a swig of the Whiskey to calm us
Them yellow men wearin' black pajamas
They wanna harm us, they all up on us
Bang bang, bullet hit my chest, feel no pain
To my left, the Captain caught a bullet right in his brain
Body parts flyin', loss of limbs, explosions
Bad intentions, I see my best friend's intestines
Pray to the one above, it's rainin', I'm covered in mud
I think I'm dyin', I feel dizzy, I'm losin' blood
I see my childhood, I'm back in the arms of my mother
I see my whole life, I see Christ, I see bright lights
I see Israelites, Muslims and Christians at peace, no fights
Black, Whites, Asians, people of all types
I must've died, then I woke up, surprised I'm alive
I'm in a hospital bed, they rescued me, I survived
I escaped the war, came back
But ain't escape Agent Orange: two of my kids born handicapped
Spastic, quadriplegia, micro cephalic
Cerebral palsy, cortical blindness — name it, they had it
My son died, he ain't live
But I still try to think positive, ‘cause in life, God take, God give",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-uncommon-valor-a-vietnam-story-lyrics
I Against I,Violent by Design,2000.0,"In my historical oracle, I blast metaphorical
Editorials educatin' in my territorial
Get torn, heavily armed with seventy bombs
That'll blast divine like the heavenly psalm
Your men'll be gone if they explore my deepest thought
I beat hearts in two, then ask demons for chalk
I'm dreamin' to stalk emcees in the dark
I walk blindfolded, the mind's golden, watch how you talk
My style is a art, recognize lyrical purity
All hell breaks loose like a mall with no security
The dopest vocalist, with my third eye I focus with
I proceed, flow with the speed of a Indie motorist
There's more to this than wasted shiny chains and bracelets
I hit tracks, my tongue waits for the brains to blaze it
Amazin' angelic, tell it to your people

Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine

Raw poems, bury your body in catacombs
Rip your soul from your limbs like brims from Jim Jones
In the Twilight Zone we disperse cowards
Vampires that stalk earth on reverse hours
Night calls, we target your facade
My latitude is God, darts out my jaws leave eternal scars
You're left breathin' out of tube straws by the marksmen
Harnessin' science for demolishin' the charlatan
Raps will make you parallax
My domain has power to block synapse inside veins
War shots fired off by the army type warlocks
Devil's plan is to have you drip in the Clorox
Beast deceivin' us, ways devious
Possessin' my peeps to walk streets
With stolen heat, like Prometheus
Elements rushin' you back to hell again
Illadelphians crush your skeleton to fuckin' gelatin

Illadelph is like the Sun, 'cause we shine with rhymes
The underground is like the Moon: you only see us at times
And at times with light skies when the stars recline
Jedi Mind, Outerspace, coincide and combine

Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs
With Jedi Mind and the Planetary be bombin' this
We stand one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread hallucinogenics since Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the Bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me, that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole clique is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath, what!

Fraudulent Cloth,The Thief and the Fallen,2015.0,"Our friendship seemed to be based on what I could do for you, homie
The sad fact is I'm the type of person that would take two for you, homie
You ever give so much till a muhfucker can't give no more?
Give so much of his soul that he feel he can't live no more?
What you want from me? You want blood from me, want another dub from me, money?
You wanna drain me of every single motherfucking drop of love from me, money?
I can feel the eyes staring at me even when it's dark, even when it's cold
I can feel Allah staring at me even though I'm marked, even though I'm old
Y'all are just some ""gimme"" muhfuckers, ""take more off Vinnie"" muhfuckers
Never giving back, don't know how to act, just a bunch of shitty muhfuckers
Gradually night goes on, gradually life goes on
It's tearing me apart, never really thought that I'd have to right this wrong
I don't think I'm anti-love, I just think I'm anti-y'all
I just think I'm anti-every-muhfucker-tryna-plan-my-fall
I was never planning to be great,  something that began as a mistake
But me being me, mama always told me I should always share what's on the plate

And just waking up is enough of a struggle today
And most of these phonies that's close to me push me away
But there ain't no weeping I'm keeping this enemy deep in my veins
Cause I love the pain

And just waking up is enough of a struggle, I don't wanna deal with the darkness
Have a motherfucker laid up by himself tryna heal from the conflict
Ever have someone close to you tell you that you really can't when you can?
I wouldn't know nothing 'bout that bullshit and that's the stamp of a man
And the same one who blamed me, the same one who defamed me
Can't make his own cash, can't wipe his own ass like a baby
Everything is past or it's light, everything is passion and hate
Everything is everything and I don't think I need to keep a track of the date
Everybody take what I offer, everybody play like a pauper
The same ones with they hands out, be the same ones that hate when I prosper
Tryna be a gentleman of sorts, tryna be a better man, of course
Tryna set a living, understand that I'ma always be a veteran of loss
What's the physiology of love? What's the physiology of pain?
What's the physiology of every single person that will probably 
get to reign?
I don't like when liberty is wrong, I don't like when misery is gone
I can tell all y'all one thing: all y'all gone' miss me when I'm gone

And just waking up is enough of a struggle today
And most of these phonies that's close to me push me away
But there ain't no weeping I'm keeping this enemy deep in my veins
Cause I love the pain
And just waking up is enough of a struggle today
And most of these phonies that's close to me push me away

Razorblade Salvation,"Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell",2006.0,"I know all the times were hard
I know that you've been feeling down
If you only knew how I'm feeling for you
If I could take your pain
I wish that I could wash it all away
If you only knew how I'm feeling

Mommy, I'm sorry if my first letter made you cry
To be honest with you, I don't think that I want to die
Sometimes I feel like that I'm cancerous in other's lives
That's probably why I drink at night and sleep 'til four or five
It's kind of hard walking through life with my distorted eyes
When I was younger, I was stupid and I thought I'd thrive
I thought a lot about everything I said in the letter
And questioned whether or not if I was dead, you'd be better
You think my shorty would be happy if I never met her?
It's too late now, mommy, I could never forget her
Could never forget how she taught me to love
Cause my father and my grandmother is always above
It's glory above
, 
you know that daddy taught me to thug
And every time we was with nanny she'd bombard me with hugs
Damn, I miss her, mommy, and it's hard to believe
That I'm grown and I don't understand it, why did they leave?

It's better to die and sleep
Than never waking sleep
Than linger on and dare to live
When the soul's life is gone

You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing

Mommy, I think that I'mma try to stick around a while
I got a niece, and my nephews, they need me around a while
I think they need me cause they hitting that age
And they ain't trying to speak to Lenny cause they spitting they rage
Yeah, and mommy, speaking to Lenny, I think my brother need me
And we Italian, so you know my mother love to feed me
And it's the little things you do for me that make it worth it
Like when I play a joint that we did and you say it's perfect
And when Jake got knocked, you knew that I was hurt
You told me put all of my heart in the song, and it worked
I promised him that I'd be there when he got out the bing
You ain't raise me to be a liar, ma, that's not my thing
I told him that I'd hold him down the whole time that he gone
They kept him locked inside a cage, but that's cool, cause he's strong
So mommy, keep that first letter I wrote you on the low
I think I wanna stay alive and see if I can grow

You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing
You've been running around for so long
You've been hurting yourself too much
You keep messing around with darkness
You're the one who's losing

You have power and money, but you are mortal
You know you cannot escape death
But immortality can be obtained
The legend is always the same
If others have succeeded in conquering death
Why must we accept it?
I know where the immortals live
And how to obtain their secret
We too must become wise men
The elements of chemistry are many, but finite
So are the techniques of enlightenment""

I Who Have Nothing,"The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological and Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness",1997.0,"I, I who have nothing

Intersections in real time
The unbroken circle and dimensions of the mind
The tie that binds
The eternal tie that defines
The vanity of my insanity
 
in due time
Will shine
Like the night seas under the moon
The haunted corners of familiar rooms
Yet I'm consumed
We're vanishing into thin air
The realization that this shit is my cross to bear
So where
Did I think I could run away
 
to see
The people that decided to leave without asking me
But we
Decide to wait for happier tomorrows
And find someone so they can be distractions from our sorrow
But my distractions the books of paper that I scrawl in
I'm eloquent as summer breeze and leaves that have just fallen
I've crawled in a corner hoping all of this will end
With the knowledge that love is just another word for revenge
I who have nothing but the comfort of my sins
I who have nothing but the comfort of my friends

I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one

As I decay, demons prey above me like a vulture
Ability to endure contradiction is a high sign of culture
Verbal sculptures,
 self defacing
It is not God or lunacy that I am facing
But the erasing of the purity and passion of my words
The herds of cattle babble on with talk of the absurd
But I preferred
To walk away from all the feuds
To find my life is more confusing than a rubic's cube
So I'm subdued
In all my words of verbal prods
To live alone one must be an animal or a God
But it's official
All of my pain is clear as crystal
The natural side of life has now been seeming artificial
But I can hit you
And rest assured that I'mma last words
I could give a fuck about ya secrets and ya past words
I can pass words and their ability to hurt you
Patience is a virtue and knowledge is of commercial
I who have nothing but the pain that I refer to
I who have nothing but the pain that I've refered to


Lost among the miracles, I stand alone
And I've grown into a being that's sitting on top a throne
I've known
For many years that I would turn to rust
I find a reason for another breath
Before my return to dust
I become one with science and mathematics and the rising of the sun
I'm numb
To all of those who blind and cannot see
The chastiser of the enemy
Perception requires duality
Inspect ya soul, the color of coal inside the body
I have hardly come across them who's holy
Send them to the cherubim
 to control thee
Burning of the sun and frigidness of the cold
The battlefield is new but the war is now old
You can never see the merest shadow of a halo
Above the head of evil djin who's deadly like tornado
The world has become an aquarium
Full of gaping fish with murderous smiles
I on the other hand stand on the outside looking in
Writing down murderous files
I who have nothing but the lack of variation
And I who have nothing but chains and suffocation

Megatron, Jedi Mind Tricks, M.F.C
Yo, Boot Camp, listen. Yo

Yeah first of all don't make me burst and brawl
Image is nothing you fronting see the thirst in y'all
Think it's fucked up now, it get worst for y'all
Assassinate your best friend now a hearse you call
Run up on your block with dough and I curse you all
The fuck out, want to wet duke? Squirt your four
Since birth I been raw hot like surface core
Kidnap your baby's mom straight earth the whore
See I do rhyme and crime so I can purchase more
If you ain't in it for that what the purpose for
Act like you don't give a fuck though
Good so I buck fo' shots from the roof
And my man Rock catch you up close
Never give a fuck about niggas y’all not Nutso
Hype off of carbonated water and some fructose
Straight buck foes when the nigga Ruck pull the snub nose
Wait Ruck chill, what the deal it's all love though
Look into my eyes and you can tell there's something changed
Running gunning things 
knocking niggas out like Clubber Lang
The gun I bring is straight for fucking beating you down
Heating you down leaving you six feet deep in the ground

It's some real motherfuckers gon rock tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight
Or somebody in the club getting shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

I'm the motherfucking ungrateful
My heart is hateful, my tongue ripped
Licking on the blade that slayed you
You faggots act as bitch as RuPaul
You niggas share one milkshake with two straws
You're trapped with no doors, four walls tighten
Seeing the roof fall, feeling the floors heighten
Crushed in shit, your bones and blood siphoned
And put into a jug we sip before fighting
I'm raw lightning; my power extends
In the planet and out through the opposite ends
Black man travel through the universe and back
While cavemen still though that the earth was flat
But we kept the sacred plans, now we carry
Throughout the ancient lands
Before the separating of the sands
When God saw the power I create in my hand
He banned my gene strain from replicating in man
 (x2)
It's some real motherfuckers going rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash getting got tonight
Or somebody in the club getting shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

I'm tasteless; there's beauty in strange places
I find beauty in razors
I find beauty in blood dripping from ya faces
I find beauty in the Qur'an and all of its Aramaic equations
I find beauty in twelve gauges
I find beauty in teaching you what the definition of pain is
I find beauty in stainless
Steel that can kill and reveal the front of your grill
You're brainless
Y’all don't wanna test Vinnie Paz patience
I crack jaws and swing swords of the ancients
Y’all pretended to overstand the matrix
Without attempting to overstand its basics
We dedicated to cats that's been thugging
Vinnie Paz got more hoes then Jim Duggan
Y’all been ducking for quite some time now
Vinnie 'bout to teach you how to write some rhymes now
We aim beams in between your eyebrows
Jedi Mind, Sean P combine now

It's some real motherfuckers goin rot tonight
All your jewels and your cash gettin got tonight
Or somebody in the club gettin shot tonight
Sean Price, Jedi Mind keep it hot tonight

And God Said to Cain,The Thief and the Fallen,2015.0,"Don Corleone here to tell you about loyalty, respect and underground shit

The myth of a man let your bridges wither and dance
Oblivious now, primitive, I'm Olympian, now it's routed in pistols
Allow me to buy the album, child imbeciles
I was a coward out to intend powerful minutes for
The crowd, the men, the rowdy, loudest towered sour diesel
Out to seek a pile of reeking, reaching demons, wild deacons
Denial deep, denial seek the child
Teaching my own preaching means
And thinking why I'm leaving rhymes leaking by the evening
Who'da thought the hammer hit ya?
The Ruger spark, leave you handicapped, trapped in wheelchairs
Drop bomb, calm flow forming on
Important, I'm raw mob (Don Corleone)
Take this offer, the vengeance refuse to
Amend all you're used to, remember that you're useful
Uh, and the Godfather speaks
R.A. and Vinnie Paz, Stoupe on the beat
Let's go, Let's get it

You go against the family, you get buried

And y'all could never fuck with JMT

Yo, to the piano blue diablo, do an Amadou Diallo
Out the Kilimanjaro, animal, Italiano
Mario Bava giallo, I beat apollo, you eat a hollow
Hole in your middle, look like a seed of avocado
Life gone, I'm beyond body harm, carry an arm in my palm
Leave you bloodier than Carrie at the prom
Man, Van Damme kick a foe, Mantan
Wigger, whoa Bam Bam Bigelow, bigger flow, Riddick Bowe
Summer eighties Bananarama, da ha da ha
Had the hammer to Alabama to where the crackers are
Animated Hanna Barbera rather Cameron's Avatar
Stamina like the man out of Panama, Paz and Allah
Macking Mary Magdalene, Howard Hewett from Shalamar
Rapping assassin like I'm back with Rawkus and Agallah
Pill to a blondie, the ill Bill Cosby
Ill hobby, kill the body, Ingagi, I killed Gandhi
I like Chi-Lites, dice and knife fights
Mics syllables slang slit you, scissor precise slice
Sacrifice, lose suitable beautiful life price
And I could conquer the Devil and I could revise Christ, c'mon

You go against the family, you get buried
It's R.A., A-F-R-O, Stoupe and Vinnie P
Cause most these rappers nowadays is fairies
And y'all could never fuck with JMT

The mythical man, who come from indivisible fam
You pitiful fam, this shit is gon' get physical fam
You kicking the can, I'm visual like Dario Argento
Like stabbing you with a pencil inside of the instrumental
If that ain't what you was into, I'll slide inside of your mental
And provide you with a rhyme, that can silence the instrumental
I body you with the Ginsu, but that'll probably be drawn
It's not so hidden, it got a kind of me gone
And I'mma probably be wrong and y'all will probably be on
The anomaly is how you'll be on a quality song
The bodies is on my lawn, the bodies have been deformed
The bodies have been piling up, but I've been silently calm
I had to sound the alarm, I had to try to get rid of 'em
Riddlin' with the Ritalin, little bit of adrenaline
A little bit of medicine in the middle of Ital' and
The only way to really begin again is to end again

You go against the family, you get buried
It's R.A., A-F-R-O, Stoupe and Vinnie P
Cause most these rappers nowadays is fairies
And y'all could never fuck with JMT

Envision blackness, leave you hat-less, fucking cap-less

The ill thugs, we box with steel gloves
Doubt my faith you can taste the slug case

Why you wanna battle the kids with steel tongues?

We itching to kill, that's why we spitting the real
Stick to the drill and maybe we'll be gripping a mill'

he told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time yet time feared the pyramids
He gave me more jewels
He told me that Amenhotep was immortal
I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the 
Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and Muwali rings
And your whole team Judas
My road thin, gold skin like Zeus'
I speak the dialog of the dead
I practiced the same war tactics in King Arthur's head

Spit it like Aristotle,

I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now known as the Dead Street Apostle
We see them Feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread till they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates where you can't breath
Stay high off that dead weed
In the mind is where I plant seeds to grow fruit
Of king's so brute of army troops, 
mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite dish and stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take more than one scoop
It's Priesthood

So if they can't be trusted, may you return where the dust is""

You don't wanna see desert eag' heat pop you

Walk back to the sand of Iraq and let the prophet breathe
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk in war with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shot the beast with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep to be a strong Pharaoh
It's a war when the gods spit
It's Allah when I split the icebergs in the Arctic

Black Winter Day,"Servants in Heaven, Kings in Hell",2006.0,"Torn apart now
I cannot have this combination
And fusion of your elixir
Torn apart now
These are the choices we've made
Do I swallow or walk away?

Most of my adult life I've been torn into two
If you love me, then I love you and this song is for you
It's tight hard when you know that you sick
And your shorty seeing you as an emotional wreck
The closer I get, it's like the farther I feel
And my heart has turned into this heavy armor and steel
It's hard to be real, hard to listen to the dumb shit
And I take a lot of pills cause it numbs shit
I wish I had another path to follow
Wish that I could be a man and learn to pass the bottle
A graphic novel, my future a box or an urn
Having dreams about death, but I'm not that concerned
And I'm diseased, through the seasons they turn
Watching leaves from the trees turn diseased and they burn
I'm eager to learn, but I'm holding my breath
And every day alive is just another closer to death


Yeah, I've been alive longer than I expected to be
And took care of everything that's expected of me
Took care of my girl and my mother
I told her that I'm always here and I love her
I handle shit differently cause I'm grown now
And the truth is that I'd rather be alone now
I'd rather not have to deal with the day
And I hate when people ask me how I'm feeling today
My brother Rasul, we had a beef and grudge
But we grew up together, cousin, so it's peace and love
I wish y'all the best, I wish y'all the shine
I wish I didn't wanna off my thoughts with a nine
I'm thoughtful and kind, but I'm evil alas
But everything I love has turned to a tedious task
I feel that life a waiting game for people to pass
But nobody ever want you to see through the mask


I don't wanna be a burden to y'all
I just wanna know exactly what my purpose is for
I feel like nothing I do is ever right
And that I'm acting a fool another night
And I admit, I don't take care of myself
So I do a lot of thinking and preparing myself
'Cause the fact is my father died young and I might too
And it ain't any way to tell what I might do
I don't wanna leave my mother behind
I don't want for her to cry, because the struggle is mine
I don't want for her to grind no more
I don't want for her to work a 9-to-5 no more
I ain't have to work a fucking 9-to-5 before
So I'm trying to get this money to provide for y'all
And if the shit ain't work out and I'm suddenly gone
Just remember that the motherfucking love isn't gone

Before the Great Collapse,Legacy of Blood,2004,"To face what we are in the end
We stand before the light
And our true nature is revealed
Self-revelation is annihilation of self

Mummy, I don't wanna live no more
I don't think I got nothin' else to give no more
It's like I lost my passion for life
It's like all my actions are trife
I don't feel like I used to about the world
I don't feel like I used to about my girl
I just wanna die mummy cause it's too hard
I just wanna lie calmly and to view God
Ever since daddy died it's been pain mummy
It's like there's something wrong with my brain mummy
You was always there for me so I love you
I die for you and I place no one above you
Tell Lenny and the kids that you stay strong
And when I meet my maker that I'm gonna pray for'em
And tell P that I think he'll be a great father
Tell Young that I think he'll be a great author
Tell Planet that his wife and kids are gorgeous
And the same go for Andy and for Marcus
Tell Syze that I have faith in 'em
And never let the industry snakes get 'em

The entire world is a graveyard
(The ending of time)
We're the ones
(The ending of time)
Who let the dying know
(The ending of time)
The hour has come

I got a few things more I should say mummy
I never meant to hurt you in any way mummy
I never meant to hurt anyone, it's God's work
Cause wakin' up everyday for me is hard work
And tell June that she was the love of my life
And that I never stopped lovin' here even in spite
All the things that we went through together
Through the highs and lows and bad weather
Let Frank know he always made me smile
Tell him back in the days was crazy wild
Tell Stoupe that I always had his back, ma'
And we was meant to be together on a track, ma'
Tell Cheek I consider him a brother
When I die, the pain will spit into another
That's just how life goes ma, it's painful!
I'll come back to you in dreams as an angel
So don't blame yourself for what happened
Cause you was the best mother that I could fathom
So I'm going to the first place I can go
I love you, sincerely Vincenzo!

Mommy just tell everyone I love them know
What I'm saying? tell my man mike tell my magruff
Keep holding me down know what I mean?
Who let the dying know tell them to stay strong
Tell Devious to keep doing his thing mommy
The hour has come tell locke to keep his head up things
Gonna get better know what I'm saying?
Everything's going to be good for everybody it's just hard
Its just hard for me I know this may seem like its
The easy way out but its not the pain hurt

And I do harm for this big cream, the whips and the carriage

Pull up wit some big shit, lieutenant shit, hitting the hazards
Spot a bitch wit that Cris habit, gotta have it
Fuck shorty and send her OT wit a brick in her baggage
Roll where the clubs at slip for the rabbit
Trick only lick dick status to get cabbage
She get lathered to the dick baptist
Who back on the map? Giancana wit a vengeance
It's drama to the finish, put the Llama to your appendix
And squeezing the slugs, gun powder season your blood
I'm a legend breathing, the reason you thug (nigga)

Still real, busting the Glock

Y'all believe lies like y'all was Catholics
I rap in Arabic, so my message is just immaculate

I don't even buck at you cats, you that corny

And if you don't, you gonna find your body stuffed in the ground
We buckin' em down, cuz that's how wrong my life is
Y'all don't overstand how fuckin' strong my wife is
I'm from a time where every song was righteous
Before rap was just a swarm of white kids
And y'all a witness to the dawn of hypeness
Or just another victim to the pawns and sheisters
I'll feed your corpse to a swarm of vipers
Let em suck the blood till your form is lifeless

Speech Cobras,Violent by Design,2000.0,"When I was a little kid, my mother told me not to stare into the sun. So once when I was six, I did. The doctors didn't know if my eyes would ever heal. I was terrified, alone in that darkness. Slowly, daylight crept in through the bandages, and I could see, but something else had changed inside of me

I'm the fire bearer, holder of the sun
The earth and the universe combined as one
An everlasting energy taking all forms
Blue skies on sunny days, terrible storms
The one who tears down what you adorn
And curses the material things that you mourn
But look up in the sky because I am the dawn
And the light that empowers your flesh as you yawn
Strong, undeniably so, Lif better known as a society foe
The deity glow reach into my center
I bet you feel pleasure and pain as you enter
The tormentor, pleaser, embracer, squeezer
As your skeleton crush, your physical turns into gelatin, plus
Due to over stimuli, you liquify
I send you back to the earth soil to quench the turmoil
When the ground splits to swallow of corporations and cops
Give birth to rocks so we can have solid ground on which to walk
Stand strong and talk and write down theories in chalk on the side walk

My style orbits round nine planets of forces
Ominous metaphorics envision a devil corpses
Lion hoarder, mad scientist slash author
Present the type of horror that boils your holy water
Get warped with the knowledge that folds the holy father
Hard boys become toys inside the real saga
So why bother, my whole floor alliance is harder
So bring the drama, we all know that science is smarter
I set off crowds, style wild like a circus
I seek new souls when I walk past churches
Allah praise you, stay true to a devout purpose
Seeking out the wise wherever the God searches
Flows that I embark on leave your squadron shadow dodging
Lyrics assault men like slugs that fill harkness
No option, narrow odds
Fucking with gods is straight gambling with your tarot cards

Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
Look into the eyes of the...

Open the gates of Midian for the fangs like the flesh
Three cyborgs who Bang like Ladesh

Yet the critics are parasitic like a tape worm
The hate burn, scathe the nerve of a Buddhist
Snake turn and fake yearns; the kiss of Judas
We take lives with knives steady abusing you
With the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
Bruising you with text of a Harvard class
Ikon will smash into shards of glass
To reform into a whirlwind of sand
Then reborn into the world Hologram
A solemn man with plans to entwine matter
Minds splatter from the grind of my divine hammer

The devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell

They shitty like suppositories, that's the end of the story
Bury his body in Missouri
Banish the apparatus of Gladys to crematories
My territory, perimeter of purgatory
Stingy in winches of vicious, malicious inflictions upon your click
Circulatory
Causing head spasms
Rip through your motherfucking temple like Phantasm

Swarm on the warm blood like malicious pirahnas

Infect you
Inject you with the gunpowder pegs
Indent your forehead with hot lead
Whether in the abode of the dead
Or resting in the Zions
Allah stay chasin' the dough like wild lions
Unchained tearin' your flesh we unfed
Flyin' through, like birds we takin' your daily bread

Seems shame to their love pure
O Love, your eyes lose lure
When I behold eyes blinded in my stead!
Your slender attitude
Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed
Rolling and rolling there
Where God seems not to care:
Till the fierce love they bear
Cramps them in death’s extreme decrepitude
Your voice sings not so soft,—
Though even as wind murmuring through raftered loft,—
Your dear voice is not dear
Gentle, and evening clear
As theirs whom none now hear
Now earth has stopped their piteous mouths that coughed",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-muerte-lyrics

I’ve got a niece and best believe she mean the world to me
And she don’t need to see the shit they think a girl should be
90-pound skinny bitches, that ain’t even girl to me
Essentially this shit designed to take a hold of you
Telling lies till your vision take control of you
They finding different ways to take your fucking soul from you
A show about a model make your self-esteem low for you
Everything is fake trust me no one that lovely
I’ve met a lot of famous people and they fat and ugly
I ain’t any better I just think the fact is funny
That they’ll take a little girl and pimp her for the cash and money
And what's gonna become of them in like fifty years
When Hannah Montana turnin' into Britney Spears
They chew you up and spit you out cause no one really cares
And ain't nobody gonna hold you when you really scared
Where the parents at cousin this is really bad
Is this the motherfucking manager or really Dad
Is he concerned about his daughter or his silly pad
This ain't gonna change nothing I just think it's really sad

Then send you home missing a limb and not provide a dime

Take the television show Cops for example
That’s the shit that they want America to watch and sample
Never showing you how dirty that they really is
And that they hide behind they badge and that they really bitch
I ain't never met a pig in my life
And I ain't want to catch a body on the jig of my knife
Yeah, that’s another fucking topic for another day
I’mma tell you how they'll try to get you in another way
They tell you that there’s something wrong with you, you need they drugs
But there ain’t nothing fucking wrong with you, they thieving thugs
They sell drugs in commercials, at the same time
Lock a motherfucker up for the same crime

When you pray for the rain, you gotta deal with the mud
And when you pray for the pain, you gotta deal with the blood
You ain't capable to hate, if you ain't able to love
But it get muddy in the middle, so I stay with the snub
And I'm Official Pistol 'til the veins stop runnin'
You in hell and it's hot when them trains stop runnin'
And you don't have a choice when the game start dummin'
And your physical is still, but your brain start runnin'
Why I let them eat, but I must have been out of it
Like walked in a portal inside of Being John Malkovich
Y'all are talking loud, but you should just turn it down a bit
Your hands over your head, like you was reading a counterfeit
And I don't rhyme over nothing if it don't sound sick
And all of y'all muhfuckers bite is like a brown pit
Clap at you, like you wearing cap and gown shit
A bunch of Sicilianos shoot at you inside a Crown Vic'

I don't know you, and you don't know me
We should go separate ways, I'ma keep it OG
Come on, I don't know you and you don't know me
You should go that-away, I'ma keep it OG

Young boys out here think that rappin' is dead
Glorifying dirt bags and they trappin' instead
I'ma ressurect hardbody rap from the dead
Crucify 'em like Christ, put a rack on his head
I've been here for twenty years, and y'all have been here for two days
Ain't nobody talking to you dippin' into Kool-Aid
Razor under the tongue, I cut you like a school day
Blood spill in high definition like a Blu Ray
The bullets in this motherfucker small, but the shotty big
Recoil make you kick back like Karate Kid
I ain't tryna offend a motherfucker but I prolly did
I ain't playing 'round, motherfucker, some'n gotta give
But I don't give a fuck, money, I will get your nana hit
Vinnie a gorilla, I will feed you a banana clip
Only way to get 'em dirty is to get your hands in it
And I don't play politics, I was never a fan of it

Or hopin' Jesus or the police's bring the person back

I only been in love once, then I learned from that
A ride or die bitch, said she'd never turn her back

Who tryin' to waken you from your spiritual laziness
I'm thinkin' outside the box from now on
Like different ways that I can kill the cop from now on
During day is when I used to sell boom to the tenants
And at night with dark shaman and hallucinogenics
That's when I let the fight in me pass through
And when I let the spiritual light in me pass through
I guess this just somethin' that come when you grown
Like the positive and negative that come with the throne

Does every Muslim in the world come equipped with a bomb?
Does every rap video have a chick in a thong?
I don't know if we livin' no more
I don't know if Pazienza even driven no more
Uppercut, right cross on the tip of the jaw

Death Messiah,A History of Violence,2008.0,"Did protons and electrons create the Earth?
Or did Allah meditate, and create his birth?
Is everyday in this place a curse?
Or should I pray on my knees and embrace this dirt?
I don't know if there's a reason I'm here
I feel the only thing that's driving me is reason and fear
And seeing death to me conceivably near
So I don't give a fuck what you think about me reaching for beer
I don't worry anymore about what my friends do
I have a more urgent matter to attend to
Is there something there bigger when I die and vanish?
That weaves everyone and everything into a canvas
I'm not smart enough to think I have a resolution
I'll never be a man with mediocre constitution
My father told me that blood and power intoxicate
And that tyranny is a product of his father's hate

I recognized the guilt and sins of the father
And recognized what's built and what stems from the author
Understand man is not a machine
He needs a surface and a purpose and a reason for being
Either way I'm gon' stick with my fam
Regardless if that's a dream of a ridiculous man
And I'm becoming more indifferent everyday
So naturally all the questions have faded away
Some of the things that I said I hated to say
But blame ya self mothafucka you made it this way
I don't think I would even if I was able to stay
I don't think you're good I would sit to the Angels and pray
But everybody gotta deal with they self
If they cut another throat for the material wealth
If it's a problem are you man enough to deal with the help?
Or are you destined for the darkness of concealing ya self?

I'm trying to deal with the 30 years I've spent in prison
Not the physical because of existentialism
I back myself into a previously dead position
When all I ever had to do was just repent and listen
Why can't everybody leave me alone?
I'm the only one who really need to see that I've grown
You ain't smart enough to see what I know
I like to stab myself and let me fucking bleed till I go
But I'm just scared what would happen on the other side
Tryna fight the good fight, how many of us died?
I don't know if I trust the people that hang with me
Is it God or is it the Big Bang Theory?
I know some really good people and they slang near me
But I don't think karmically that they should hang really
At 30 years old I don't have peace yet
And I ain't get out of the belly of the Beast yet",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-death-messiah-lyrics

Uh yo yo, yo yo yo, Jedi Mind yo yo
Yo, my words sojourn, spread em like a slow germ, infected
Disease is collected and quarantined from my method
The borderline where the animal and divine become separate
I'm Def Leppard, case of beautiful hell on a record
Compel the skeptic when Kamachi unveil the epic
It's needed and requested
Brought to you like Elijah in the message
A jury of ancestors was sequestered
To decide my fate, for conductors of viscous vespers
Candlelight death is extras
Is usually hollow point flesh presses
Until they skin caress stretchers
I'm the best to finesse textures
My rhyme fabric, is elaborate, scrolls kept in a gold cabinet
Open the book to the chapter of this old soul magic
Juju tongue to voodoo come, behold this untold havoc
Up north grab it, then I hit the south pole with a magnet
East and west avid, now my name on all four points of the square
It's firmly established, the language is lavish
First to rock Roshashannah's and African pajamas
Swear before I die to be there with the best of the rhymers
Music for different ears, hears in different spheres
Global ink like the mobile link, make sure the pitch is clear
K-A-M-A-C-H-I be the dopest in here

But y'all mo'fuckers can't overstand skill
If y'all stalk me, we Buck like Milwaukee
But y'all, y'all just do a lot of talkin
And maybe that's why you fear what the devil does
Maybe that's the appeal of a metal slug
You ain't a ghetto thug, you an actress
That's unnatural, like love between faggots!
""In the company of ...fear""

I burn leaf with Ikon and the Chief nigga
This next bud is not for you
Watching you made me land a clenched hand to your nostril
Stopping you from giving the god cold stares
Beware, my flares put poets in rolling chairs
None are prepared when the holocaust begins
You'll have the roach smoked down to the sole of your Timbs
Now I'm, holding your gems, you're holding for dear life
Any motherfucker holding the heat can have ice
You're just like a bitch with no top on
At the Houston five, you lay down to get shot on
Double check, you're dead, plugged twice in your mug
I'm high off the weed, drunk off the cop's blood

""Too much...I'm tired""
""In the company of those that fear""
""In the company of....fear""

Fear of today, fear of tomorrow
Fear of our neighbors, and fear of ourself""

Or take you through the torture chamber and behead the bitch

I think I got a problem with being faithful
It's not that I ain't grateful, it's just something about me so hateful


I'm strutting with the black mask, can't pass on the cash
Relax on the grass, can't slack on the slash

I'm all about the cash, outwit and outlast
In mass covered in black from gun powder blast
Can care less if you wear a flag or a badge
I'm trying to have mattresses of cash
I'm trying to have the bachelor pad built up with packages and bags
No matter how many bodies amass in the trash
I stay on the move, bad news travels fast
I stay with the smoking weapon and no discretion
It's a gross obsession, I keep it close under low detection

Manifest the universal mind into the law
Travelling lands, 
I stand on sands of chemical vibrations
The math, kings of light departed in wrath
So where you gonna stand when the 
Elohim return
Seven great stages throughout the ages say you burn
It's my turn to shine
I redefine the crystalline-biological structures, implanted in your mind
So I find the deaf, dumb and blind
And bless 'em with science, and leave the blind ones behind
Descending into big balls of mass, in the form of rain
The Verbal Hologram brings pain
So rearrange disagreeable ways that brought you the darkness
Take hold and rip out your soul from your carcass
And rise away like a sham
The Verbal Hologram is the verbal avalanche
One last chance to re-plan and over-stand
Before the Hologram sends your camp to Holy Land
So ask your man, when he returns to where I sent him
The plan was to kill God and reinvent him
Practicing Black Magical tactics like voodoo
Attacking like the seven deadly warships of Nibiru

Travelling through portals
, the thunderbolt of battles, the lord of the

The zeal of the seven, the rising of the demon
The lost books of the Bible and forgotten books of Eden
The heathens, who burn like pyrhosis
Handed the Holy tablets, like Moses
The blackening of roses, will send you to the edges of the land
The emerald tablets, of Thoth the Atlantean
The hands of the mighty lion of Judah
Will throw you through the triangular portals of Bermuda
Exploring the Hologramic aspects of consciousness
For aliens to devour
Orthodox first relativistic equations for power
The shower of acid rain brings pain to the land
You cannot kill what you cannot see
The Verbal Hologram

Don't ask me to pity those people. I don't mourn them any more than I do the thousands that died at Sodom and Gomorrah

A rapper so ill, my flow just stole Jehovah's heart
My fist'll break a fucking boulder in half
When I was young, I'd smack a stick off of your shoulder and laugh
I've chosen a path, spoke on my emotional past
Spoke on everything from war to how the ocean is vast
My flow is too fast, you can't contend with me there
Or it's gonna be a massacre, Tiananmen Square
My pen is prepared, and so the guns and the swords
And death the only thing you get for fucking with lords
Been stuck in some wars, but Vinnie fought his way out
The double jab, right cross what they caught in they mouth
I'm calling them out, anyone who fuck with my fam
Thinking that they got away and they was lucky, then blam
Buck them and scram, don't use the shotty no more
They didn't think that Vinnie P was catchin' bodies no more

""So who the next to get it?""
""You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God""
""I'll take the life of anybody trying to change what's left""
""Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it""
""So who the next to get it?""
""You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God""
""I'll take the life of anybody trying to change what's left""
""Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it""

This is death and doom, my occupation putting flesh in tombs
Whether or not you shot, the aggression looms
I'm the one that speak the language of fate
I'm the one that speak the language and the anguish of hate
My banger is great, it split the top of your dome
Like the book of Revelations for the prophets in Rome
I'm locked in the throne, whether you like it or not
Because I'm chemically the reason liquid nitrogen hot
I'm nice with the Glock, nicer with the semi's and Tecs
But I'm nicest when I'm clapping at my enemies necks
They tend to regret ever sending me threats
Cause they know the only thing that they could send me is checks

""So who the next to get it?""
""You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God""
""I'll take the life of anybody trying to change what's left""
""Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it""
""So who the next to get it?""
""You ain't gotta go to church to get to know your God""
""I'll take the life of anybody trying to change what's left""
""Then lift up your whole hood like you got oil under it""

Yeah, I'm like Mark David Chapman with a Salinger book
Stalk my enemy and let the fucking silencer cook
It's down in the book, that my competitors ain't really ready
The way my four pound turn your stomach to spaghetti
It's like the Serengeti, because it's hot here
The way that policia set it on the block here
They pushing rocks here, in the dead of night
I take my Glock and I point god/point guard like Brevin Knight
Your fucking men are mice, you shouldn't answer that
If my father was still alive, he wouldn't stand for that
He wouldn't stand for how you act like a bitch
Wouldn't stand for anybody who a rat or a snitch
I'm back in this bitch, we was gone for a while
Until a shorty told me that he heard my song and he smiled
I'm strong but I'm wild, they say I drink too much
The only problem that I have is that I think too much, pussy",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-put-em-in-the-grave-lyrics
Marciano’s Reign,The Bridge & The Abyss,2018.0," Vinnie Paz
The rain is gods tears, it pours when he cry
But know that you welcome in his arms when you die
The rain is the form of a gas in the sky
That bring back life to a plant when it’s dry
The rain purify and wash away dirt
And wash away anything in your life that could hurt
Rain is water in its most pure form
The rain pour down make it cool when it’s warm
The rain sound good on my pain when I’m sleep
The ocean love rain and the drain in the deep
Rain play a role in protecting the ground
Prevents us from the the politicians lettin’ us down
The rain known to alleviate stress
So go for a walk in the rain it’s the best
The rain came then the love came over me
Its Pete's Theme let the love rain over me

Ooh Let it rain, let it rain
Let me know the cold and how it feels
And I'll never turn away
Ooh feel the pain, beautiful pain
Let me hold on to the memory of how you looked today
 Vinnie Paz
Embrace the pain boy it’s good for the soul
You face the pain and see it could make you whole
Ignoring the pain will make you hurt someone else
Go towards pain it’s a gain for the self
Pain isn’t bad it could make you feel free
It isn’t life threating it make me feel me
Kill two birds with one stone, even three
By recognizing pain is too painful to see
Pain is the opposite, run it to hell fleein’
Negative emotion is key to well being
Anger and pain are an important part of life
Important as the way the sun sets in the night
Pain can help you breathe and calculate fact
Give you time to think and evaluate that
Accepting the pain by breathing slow, breathe deep
And you will never have to feel pain when you sleep

Ooh Let it rain, let it rain
Let me know the cold and how it feels
And I'll never turn away
Ooh feel the pain, beautiful pain
Let me hold on to the memory of how you looked today",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-marcianos-reign-lyrics
The Philosophy of Horror,Legacy of Blood,2004.0,"I was Albert Eiensteins mind, I was Italy's fine wine
I was working with God when he defined time
I was there when the guns first let off
There when they cut King Charles head off
There when the CIA battled the crack
And the tradgedy and triumph of Geronimo Pratt
Punch a faggot til his nose bleed heavy
Dead'em all then I escape in green chevy
I merk your wisdom
, spit a dart at you to hurt your vision
Put you in the worst position in a turkish prison
Yeah... and my intention is to waste y'all
And cover your body with stitches like a baseball
I fucking lace y'all with the word of the sword
And leaving you bleeding in a ditch while you serving the lord
You deserve to be mauled by an army of bees
Just another faggot dead in his army fatigues

Fuck ya crucifix, your religion 
and its uselessness
Your propaganda is more wickeder than luciphers
Islamic scientists predicted the computer chips
I spit a rap at you to rock you like Medusa's lips
You fucking goons are sick, and y'all can see that
And y'all are my sons like 
Ebrahim and Eshak
So lets take a walk through the tivest town
I'm the 
divine science of the light and the sound
I'm the sublime giant with the right to the crown
I'm the divine tyrant and I'm striking you down
So I teach my kin to attack the 
beast
For trying to hide me from the 
4th book of Maccabees
You wack MC's catch a hook to the head
Cause y'all don't know about the 
tibetan book of the dead
You don't know about anything that's important
About the 
dead sea scrolls
 found in 
Jordan
About the way that you conduct yourself in Satan's wrath
But I don't fuck with you, you walking down the pagan's path

I'm a swordsmen, the apocolypse horsemen
What makes me smile is another's misfortune
I like to see your body in flames scortchin'
I like to see a part of your brain auctioned
I like to see inside of your main organs
I like to see inside of your veins pourin'
I find beauty in another's pain
I find beauty in the spirit of god but I don't fuckin' change
I find 
serenity in torture
My thoughts are too pure for the human mind to author
Its called God Consciousness
Its a level beyond the 
gods marred thoughtlessness

Took a physical odyssey to the fathers of Shabazz
With the shamans of the Cherokees
Arrived in Nevada, ten miles away from NASA
Met the farmer in which he revealed to me the
Ohioan crop circles that linked all the star constellations
To the nineteenth galaxy
The metaphysicist that quote the Roswell
New Mexican deserts of Death Valley
With E.B.E. – extraterrestrial biological entity
Discovering extraordinary memories
Glided across Glassland
Suddenly seeing illuminations from the seven heavens circle of sand
Of Area 51 and 57, separate the schoolkid and reveal the reptilian
I seen the CIA transform into the species of Greys
The Sabbath seven adding up to seven levels of the Majestic 12
Neoclassic traveller
I travel the Twilight Zone with Einstein and Nikola Tesla
Walk through the wilderness of Ibilis
As the flying disc of Ezekiel
The pope stands upon the podium
Becomes a Zeta Reticulian
Behold the arrival of the Nephilim

Beware the prophecies of the Tarots
Alien spacecraft flying away like Sparrows
Study the lost prophetic books of the bible
That recites fallen body energies: spiritual survival
Flying discs seen in Ezekiel 1:3
Granted Kingu a tablet of destinies
Semjase spoke the word of the Bavarian Illuminati
I bring forth harmonics of Hiroshima and Nagasaki
Annunaki planted the seed where I dwell
Either vortex turbines pulling me to hell
Awareness upon my savannah is omni dimensional
Grey species has a common memory complex of the social
Liquid crystal colloidal membranes responding
To the spectrum of the universal intelligence matrix
The basis is that extraterrestrials created Christ
And have a device that recorded all of Earth's history
And can display it in the form of a hologram precise
Construction of synthetic humanoids is among us
You have entered the Land of Nod
To face the deafening thunders and the spiritual wonders
Because the harvest now is coming
Beware the worldwide ancient tunnel system
The government is running
Hectic! Verbal slaughterer of the Judeo-Christian ethic

Rāma Rāma Hare Hare

And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land
And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land

Fled with the five, led through a European wooded ravine
And seen Stonehenge connect and bring upon the Annunaki
The highest Kabbalah's mystic chants ""b'nai Elohim""
And looks to the sky for prophecy was abducted in Nebraska
Then taken back to the laboratory
Experiment performed before me
Nonearthly alien autopsy
Psycho social biological and electro-
Magnetic manipulation of human consciousness
The Vulcan walks about the abyss

The Verbal Hologram: royal killer like Shorgize
Speak Babylonian and Hebrew, Genesis like the star gods
Blessed by Biaviians like the French theologians
Antichrist is coming in the form of a powerful Roman
Development of AIDS was funded in 1969 for the seven
Injected into the hundred million Africans in '77
Cuneiform inscriptions in Western Asia of the Nabu
Dwell in hell, celestial bodies: twelve like Kathabu
But I can rob you of your spirit soul like Xenu
Elders imprisoned, negative paraphysical beings we knew
Function outside the time track like Essassani
I chose to be enclosed and I fold too like origami
Comprehend the theory of reflection like Paramātmā
In the epic Sanskrit history of the world like Mahabharata
Praise to His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada

And the world has turned on the last spin

And the world has turned on the last spin
The coming of Tan to this wicked land

Yeah, yeah, I'm a terrorist threat, burn in Hell where the devil is kept
How can we be powerful with incredible debt?
Dump the clip, hittin' you from your head to your neck
I creep with the silencer, leave you dead where you slept
I'm as vicious with the right or the left
And I stand behind my people if it's life or it's death
A knife in the chest, that's the way that we do
But if I was you, I'd be concerned about the avian flu
I pray that you do, but you ain't listen before
You ain't listen when I told you 'bout my visions of war
My system is pure, trap you like a prisoner's war
Anyone who ever met me say my liver is poor
Whoever met me say they dig my rapport
Say that he the only one who ain't a dick on the tour
Kick in the door, with my vodka, believe that
And hand Warchild all the blunts and the weed sack

Yeah, you like Napoleon Bonaparte
I throw a dart and blow your bones apart
The lonely part's when you fallin' like you Owen Hart

I wouldn't wish any of my mental conditions on you
I just wish that y'all would leave me for dead
Wish that I would go away and fall asleep in my bed
I'm lethal instead, but I supposedly thrived
Anyone or anything that got too close to me died
Supposed to be live, fuck it, I'm supposed to be king
'Pose to murder everything like an associate of Ming
Listen, I ain't takin' your word, man
Just give me all the ""Cash Money"" like Birdman


Yeah, another holy verse, never listen to what's told in church
My soul immersed in a statue that's as old as earth
I'm fuckin' Odin's curse, the living eight man
Calculate Infinity with Dillinger Escape Plan
I would walk on the Arabian with grey sand
And heal the sickness of the people where I laid hands
I was there when they created the Christ
When the Romans in Judea took the Pagan's advice
I hate what I'm like, hate that I'm afraid of the light
Hate that everyone who love me always hate what I like
Hate that everywhere I go, I get engaged in a fight
Hate that everything I say is just evasive and trife
Enraged with a knife, I don't care who I slice
I could walk into the woods and kill a bear with my mic
I'm here with my mic, fear me and be careful at night

Megatraum is a Martian, feeding off weed and cash
I dash from my ship in the Roswell crash
You smash when you bash with the clashing ox
Saw you in half without a fucking magical box
Wet pussy always seems to splash my cock
I'm dead, they just didn't leave the casket locked
Pass my block I let shots drill in your spleen
We ill marines with hand held killing machines
Steal dreams with the armored steel, guard your grill
Nigga, I was brought up by the Kents in Smallville
Following Allah's will, harboring the skill
Caught up in the real, don't give me cause to kill
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness goes
If I had to follow the moon across the globe
With the staff and white robe, I still hold metal
Disciples who walk on glass and rose petals

Yo, last rites, we fast to blast twice

We smash mics, and blast too precise
Fast 40 days and pray for 40 nights

Yo, I'm savage, I write rhymes in pitch blackness
Any motherfucker that front, is left backless

Put a slug in his grill

I keep at least a 100 grand in the mattresses
Shit so hot, soon as I write it I get indicted
I dare one y'all scared niggas to bite it
I done stood in hood lobbies getting my rocks off
With longjohns and 3 pairs of socks on
Ducking from the pigs so I don't get knocked off
Or popped off, and y'all thugs is soft
That's why your skirt get pulled up, clothes come off
Red Dragons, can't even fuck with my brain pattern
I'm online, Pentium Plus and Benz wagon
Mahdi, believe me it do ring bells
If you saw me do dirt you won't live to tell
I'd done lived in a cell, did bids in hell

Severian the Animal; I'm doing dirt like earthworms
I'm sick and original, boy; I gave birth to the first germs
I spit the acetate to make your lips evaporate
The Master Ape; bare hands will decapitate and bash your face
Pass the eighth sack of shake; twist it and blast my tape

Silencing the devil that speaks with forked tongue

Rough shit, don't even attempt sleeping
At war with the demons that live in infernal regions
Spawned from eternal semen, bred flesh predators

Grabbing your leg, so you live with the Heaven-less
Drop death's prejudice and follow me to Exodus

We ravenous, exhume the tomb of Lazarus
You blasphemous, we bring war to pacifists
Tarantulas, burn flesh like a nine Glock
Your mind stops from nine of my divine shots
Pine box is fine for a killer to run
Swing from vines and ride like Atilla The Hun
B
ring the gun, your tongue is what I'm slicing
We slap tracks and attack like M. Bison
Elohim, fuck the pagans - we mock them
And take turns to burn religious doctrines
Concoctions of pain hits from eight angles
Locked in the brain to lacerate angels

Yo, I rip mics, stick lames
Wreck nights, spit flames
Lead pipes, split frames
Kid ain't shit changed
Act trife
I grab the mic and bag your wife
Sacrifice you twice
Motherfuck an after life
Decimate your paradise
Burn tracks like thermostats
My personal attacks snap back to murder cats
I might advise, you type of guys should revitalize
Your man power, I sabotage like fireflies
With a dope rhyme
Take control of your soul
Rap a potent flow over foes
Hope you don't catch a broken nose
Opponents go to shows
Now they know their roles, they're hoes that fold my clothes
I bark at these, mark emcees, park and freeze
My words part the seas
Kill beats like heart disease

"No Jesus, No Beast",The Thief and the Fallen,2015,"The murder hadn't occurred to me, burgundy wasn't burgundy
Purposely earth to me like a virgin had given birth to me
It's irking me that you would consider uttering words to me
Nervously urging me to keep killing and killing perfectly
Certainly third degree burns followed by having surgery
When he deferred to me, he was poisoned by drinking mercury
Hurdling over things that are currently in my periphery
It's all a blur to me, I was never sensing the urgency
Never sensing emergency, never sensing the thrill
Never sensing the certainty, never searching the kill
Was never searching, everything was done in the name of wicked
The brother's name was indifferent, the hunger pain wasn't lifted
That was Satan, black wings and a man made pedestal
The only fucking rapper could see me is my identical
Another story, another chapter, another parable
I missed making music with Stoupe, cause he incredible
""God is the 777""

Vocally none of y'all are approaching me or come close to me
Hopefully you're aware that you only holding my groceries
Openly holding the only opening in the hope to me
Provoking me is only gonna result in a choking spree
Supposedly I was sent by holiness, it's unknown to me
Loaning me Book of Law without Aleister Crowley owning me
Globally doing things that you only could dream of locally
I son you motherfuckers like you was peddling dope for me
The guns is always with me so I would never feel lonely
Combine it with the fact that I'm irresponsible socially
Supposed to be the art of the mechanism of action
Embezzlement of the fraction, the pessimism of passion
It had to be the psyche and the cunning of the Assassin
The tongue will give you a lashing like Punisher when he's rapping
I bludgeon you just for asking where the other fucking rapper is
Chopping bodies up and mail 'em out in several packages

Rawhead Rex had coot in his teeth
Every single one of y'all food for the beast
And the human remains are the room for the pain
And there's rules to the game when you're new to the game
And it's blue in the vein and you shoot it again
And the sins of the father till the Lucifer's reign
Every time you think you hit bottom, bottom will drop
The Body Politic have your stomach tied in a knot
I don't rule hell but I'm merely a servant
Hell has come home to appeal to the person
Peer through the curtain, deal in a burden
Rather die standin' than kneel to the virgin
The blue go red, and the red go to black
And you move with the dead till the dead isn't that!
MURDA!

We whip asses, with Ajanti daggers
And smash this, crushing opposition like we was fascist
Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes, the faggots who can't attack it right
Take they sternum and then turn em into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood, that make a child stop
That's the rise of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say a prayer to our heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't overstand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis, who used the flame rod
You couldn't physically bruise the name God

We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

We born builders, as life takes its toll
Legends of the seven, embrace my soul
Transported off the planet, by a supreme force
And told to return on the day of Pentecost
I bisect the ways between Heaven and Earth
And scramble messages from God into your church
Deception, blinds your perception
My reflection outshines the other colors in the spectrum
The brethren, I cease the peace corps
We follow street laws, engaged in Beast Wars
The visionary bombs, with military arms
Aimed at that motherfucker with pitchfork and horns
I shed alchemy throughout the galaxy
To cause fire and ice, like Flames in Calgary
You're trapped in, the core of corruption
Left a fossil, in my path of destruction

Thou long black arm
Great gun towering towards Heaven, about to curse;
Reach at that Arrogance which needs thy harm
And beat it down before its sins grow worse

We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ
We smash mics, and blast too precise
And laugh as we cast the first stones at Christ

I am the man who lives above the force of good and evil
The man that handed down the powers to give to my people
Live under laws of bald eagle
There's no tomorrow
Get trapped with the trenchcoat killers in Colorado
Blazin spark, and feeling certain my days are marked
Live a life that conflicts with the ways I'm taught
Fuck it, we bring it hardcore, raw and ragged
Ya team must be hidin they balls, like a faggot
I came with the light and gave sight to the sages
Black ink contained to write truth on white pages
You're sliced faceless
Subjected to a massacre
Jedi Mind, bombin your moves like John Africa
We laugh at ya
The devil is the bomber
We unaffected as we protected by God's armor

Slicing elbows through ya jaw, need I say more?

You a gay maggot

Go to raves faggot
Put a hole in your heart
Destroy everything that you know and you thought
Destroy everything in Babylon
You fucking fake rap, I hate rap cause you babble on
You fucking fags are gone, 
I'm a hate monger
That's reason why you talking to the jake longer
Put the snakes on you, let you die there
And who gave you the fucking impression that I care?
I can thrive here, but I choose to die
On a fucking steady diet of booze and lye!

I don't think you wanna see inside the eyes of Vader

I stalk in the ring, you cowards sounding soft when you sing
But I'm as angry as a motherfucker caught in the bing
It's awful to think, but I'm a warrior and standing tall
And I ain't stopping like the Arab & Israeli War

Making every one of your thoughts stop
I'm god while ya'll are wrestling over pork chops
Devil had you thinking we was there when that ball dropped
I ain't gonna front; I was strapped with the doors locked

Big enough to put a fucking hole in the law, ock
That ain't something that you wanna explore, ock

In The Coldness Of A Dream,The Thief and the Fallen,2015,"Heaven or hell, which one was your home?
You lived on the edge of death with your gun

The deepest deepness is only chaos and death
Séance and breath when they play on the flesh
A queen like Neferu lay on his chest
The dïn is forever, take prey on success
I can find God without needing a coordinate
Hand to hand, man to man, feeding the unfortunate
Seven gold cities of Cibola isn't all of it
Cut a lion's head off and wear it like an ornament
This isn't something that's conventional in its origin
It's a situation of people needing some more from him
It's primordial for the Devil that want a war with him
Chaos and conflict always has been the norm for him
He was a product of 
Makavelian myth
Sacred mushrooms and some Amerindian piff
The Navajo twins that carried me in the mist
To Korriban and into the academy of the Sith

Heaven or hell, which one was your home?
You lived on the edge of death with your gun
Your wounds became scars
When you murdered your storm
You levitate high up above

Either physically or non-physically, I’m still getting paid
Hovercraft move like an Escalade in Everglades
Wise men only reminisce over better days
Groups of lamb legs served with teriyaki marinade
Mind like Stanley when he was directing Spartacus
I was getting drowned in the dark abyss
Now I'm like an arsonist
Fill your fucking body up with cartridges
And catch enough homi's, that'll open up an orphanage
And they don't know the father is a product of the rules
It's silently and vitally inviting you to lose
The truth you're looking for isn't seen in the world news
It shouldn't have effect on the healings that y'all choose
Y'all ain't have the pleasure to live life in hell
The guns mad big and sing like Adele
Ain't no other word got a ring like 'rebel'
The weight is mad heavy and bring life to scale, stupid

Heaven or hell, which one was your home?
You lived on the edge of death with your gun
Your wounds became scars
When you murdered your storm

I'm basically dazed, and lost inside a satanist maze
You face the brigade, I hate you and I pray you get AIDS
I go hard on hard beats, y'all to lazy to shave
Too lazy to bathe, and so y'all hate on the God
I'm sick of y'all eating off the same plate as the God
Y'all could never build or conversate with the God
You shooting guns off, I would bomb a nation for God

Y'all are swine eaters, that's abomination to God

I ain’t no blood, I ain’t no crip
Motherfucking hood, where I be, everyday
You don’t like me?
Come see me nigga, I ain’t no bitch
Far from the last man damn man
You could be the man what they said
So I focused on the damn plan
Face straight like I just did a handstand
Used to be shy now I’m focused like a head cam
Demoz, say hello to the sandman
Gun pop, good god where your man layin'
See that bitch right there with the damn tan
Couple shots put the bitch in the damn van
Take her home put her in the zone
Dick like an L, she gonna put it to the dome
Wack DVDs all these niggas in the streets
Showing niggas where they live and their fridge and their chrome

Jeopardize where my wife and my kids at
Come home find my young boy kidnapped
Nigga hit that L that you hit, because you motherfuckin crazy if you think I will
Pistol Gang to the day I hang
Or I see my death, I’m gonna keep it real


You should make peace before we pull the peace-makers
I don’t want the streets waking up the sleeping neighbours
I don’t want police pacing up the streets later
But the killing has me feeling like a teenager
Sign your soul over, here’s a blank piece of paper
I’ll fill in the details, you can read it later
We should keep in contact, I may need a favour
It’s not breach in contract, no release, and waivers
It’s slavery and cheap labour is a decent bargain
It’s monopoly, I’m landing on free parking
It’s blood out here, gotta keep my teeth sharpened
Gotta keep cream, gotta keep a green garden

I land in farmers crops spelling out the name 'Apathy'
Speaking my name is blasphemy, so call me your majesty

I still hear your voice in my mind
I still hear your voice in my mind
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)

I barely want you here, you think I want them here?
This is my fucking house, you think that I'ma pretend here?
They ain't my fucking blood, this ain't my kin here
Don't make me slap you up again and break a limb here
And this little one, he always starin' at the wall
Is he retarded or somethin', or he don't care at all?
You bring that autism shit up again, I swear to God
I told you it's all in your head, you couldn't bear the thought
I told you it's not a disorder, it's bad mothering
And you don't make it any better, you just choose to smother him
And this other one, she dresses like a harlot
So don't come runnin' to me when she claims she gets assaulted
And boys is gonna be boys, so they ain't to be faulted
With bitches dressed like that it's cause they wanna be exalted
So don't give me no fucking excuses, or she could get it too
I pay the bills in here, we both know that it's never you
It's my way or the highway, so make a fucking choice
Cause I don't like the way you make me raise my fucking voice
Matter fact, I'm outta here, I need a fucking beer
The choice is yours, get it together or disappear

Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)

Why the fuck ya'll still awake?
I need some time alone
The little one is crying, the other always 
dialin'
 the phone
You think I'm being rough on you? Well, I don't think I am
Watch me when I put you in this yoke and show you who I am
You're paying attention to me now? Now that I got violent?
When none of ya'll would move a fucking finger I was silent
I thought I had this beaten, and I thought that I was past it
Cause every woman that have come before you got they ass kicked
One of them was hospitalized, the other one was murdered
I made it look like accidents, cause both of them deserved it
But here we are, and I thought I have put this shit behind me
But what I'm feeling now has overcome me and has blind me
So why the fuck you're trying me?
I had to break the straw
And since this little one is cryin I have to break his jaw
And since your daughter dressing up and trying be a whore
I have to teach her a lesson and slide up in her raw
But that can wait for now, I'm gonna finish what I've started
I told your boy to shut his fucking mouth, is he retarded?
I'm the fucking victim here, the one who's brokenhearted
The one who no one loved, who was mistreated and discarded
The one who got abused and who was beaten all his life
The one who got confused and who was bleeding from the knife
I was drug through the mud, I was condescended
So I'ma take the three ya'll with me and I'ma end it
The cops is on their way now? Well, I ain't goin' to federal
But I ain't dyin' alone so now the three of ya'll is dead too

I still hear your voice in my mind
I still hear your voice in my mind
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)
Such a lovely voice (na na na na na na na)",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-what-she-left-behind-lyrics

When I say that you my dog, I mean a muzzle in your face

The guns mad big like Mutombo on the waist

Murder many infidel, Yasser Arafat
How you wanna talk shit and tuck your chain after that
Infrared beam green, aim it where your cabbage at
Dirty money lord you can check the back plate
Run up on this ras clot, show him how the gat tastes
It's a million muhfuckas in the rat race
I ain't part of that God, y'all can get the gas face
Fuck all fates, see you at Allah gates
All my dogs gonna swarm on you like raw steaks
Pies and jums, I'mma let 'em all bake
And if Vinnie here, rap in good hands like Allstate

It's the storm without the calm, a pistol in my palm

It's the life that I'm living, no fucks that I'm giving
It's a murder scene, tell the fucking ambulance to get 'em

I'm always trying to break bread
Always trying to take the fucking crown so I can take heads
Underground rappers, more bummier than bass-heads
Head-shots leave y'all Planet of The Apes dead
Jeff Chandler, I'mma let them hands fly
Just in case, Vinnie keep shooters on standby
Anybody told you any different, it's a damn lie
You ain't really beef, real beef get pan-fried
I be in Japan high, y'all be on some stupid shit
Philly streets, muhfuckers cross you like a crucifix
In sha Allah, I'mma be alive like Busilvex
Four pound, break your chest up like Mucinex
Dead cause I said so, I'mma let the TEC blow
Fiends lined up like an Air Jordan retro
Ill from the get-go, I just caught a homi'
The bullets pierce kevlar, hotter than wasabi

Fuck Ya Life,Violence Begets Violence,2011.0,"Try to stop mines from growing, I’ll make your blood stop flowing

I wet the whole entire block then I broke off
Lift the boat off Russian sickle Nikolai Volkoff
I ain’t never met a motherfucker that was so soft
I remain fire like folk who ain’t turn their stove off
And I still rhyme cousin with a flawless fervor
I got money and catch cases like Roethlisberger
And y’all are Dennis Dixon,
 that’s just something different
I need another prescription, I got a pen addiction
I got a Muslim shorty now but the ex was Christian
She ain’t overstand the godliness of my position
Anybody who ain’t family is opposition
The M9 got a big nose, Scottie Pippen
Vinnie sipping on the Goose,
 god hit this marley
My hands running out of fingers, young Vince Lombardi
I got a tet offensive similar to Victor Charlie
I meet a bitch, I don’t sweat her, this ain’t a Christmas party

Try to stop mines from growing, I’ll make your blood stop flowing
Fuck your life

I make blood money with flecks of blood splatter
It’s drug money, the aspect of it doesn’t matter
All the blood and death is what gives it the X factor
A lot of blood and sweat goes into the trespassers
I kill swiftly, I like to take life quickly
I take a pint of blood and make moonshine whiskey
I like to keep the 911 lines busy
I like a fun time in a crime-ridden city
All the blood that we use is worth every bump and bruise
Once the hunt pursues we ain’t on the Onion News
I don’t run from the problems I start usually
We wet you up, no lifeguard on duty
Then I’m at the bar or a movie
Then I’m with a beauty watching hardcore nudity
Had to ditch the bitch that thinks we’re dating exclusively
The old grey mare she ain’t what she used to be


I’m that last line of coke that you see on the mirror
Take your last sniff, now you think you seeing shit clearer
I’m the nigga that’s behind you waiting to get paid
I’m that hard-assed dick that’s waiting to get laid
I’m them Pumas that you rock that was made out of suede
You the nigga came to cop and got caught in the raid
I’m the venom that lies within the king cobra’s core
That new blood soaking through the enemy’s soul
The spoils of life, the ills of men
John Wayne Gacy,
 
Charlie Manson, killing again
I’m released from the penitent, mind state militant
Bombs underneath the tent, bismillah I repent
Sent to Earth from a distant galaxy
I am no contradiction, far from a fallacy

Manifest in the mirror, don't sing lip shows
We go beyond Man it's hard to believe
Guess we're blessed it's a miracle So watch
It's the Army Of Pharaohs bring your squad to its knees
Go from flesh to the spiritual Gotta pray for a miracle
Like Moses when he parted the seas
Yes, yes, it's a miracle

They talking stupid on the stoop, I'm in the studio with Stoupe
I'm unusually loose, In a movie role with truth
Co-starring, don't spar with no artist my level
Froze target, slow harvest, bogarted by metal
So god but so ghetto, so far but so settled
Don't harbor no problems, no father slow peddle
Roseto late bloom, now silence the method
We all got a history of violence on the record
Except for this record Babygrande, if this lady take the stand
Then my record's playing in the court like a reggae band
Still a lady's man, Mag expects it
I don't get brain, I test dames' gag reflexes
Ecstasy dealer, I bag they X's
Stab 'em breathless without grabbing breakfast
I might pull her hair though, or with something out with air holes
Get lower than a flat when I'm reaching where the spare goes!


Yeah, yo
You can Never fuckin' test the God
The kickback of the Smith & Wesson hard
Allah think that you a devil for ingesting lard
That's a part of every lesson that he said to Fard
Vinnie never claimed to be a prophet, I'm a vessel God
Me and my seven Mac-11s have a special bond
Same bond when the Qu'ran give me a special calm
I wave the motherfuckin' ratchet like its Desert Storm
And use it so I can detach you from your legs and arms
Im the one who reinventin the steel
The one who took the art of rhymin', reinvented the wheel
My venom will kill
My spit game like a neurotoxin
They call me blood and guts warrior, Arturo Boxin
It's nothing anything or anyone can do to stop 'em
Matter of fact even attemptin', it's a foolish option
Anyone who try to disrespect my crew, I pop em
Or tell the rest of the Boriqua, bring the tool and ox 'em


Bury them and the Aryans that carried them
All stare, scared their humanitarians
Spare none of them, tear their young from them
Shun them, run them into Kingdom Come's conundrum
Hunt them, punish them, confront them
Drunken them, come undone Sunken
Summons him from the stomach of a sunless dungeon
Bludgeon them, make the chump to become consumption
Not an option to stop us, fairly obvious
They're innocuous, the despair of the populous
Get your fill of ill-gotten goddesses
Drill them with a modest amount of bottomless promises
Turn the water scarlet red, let it churn from the faucet heads
Get to detailed little trails in the carpet threads
Have 'em adamantly smack on the architect
Havin' carte blanche on the carnage, have my heart set",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-godflesh-lyrics

You burn at failed attempts reachin' the sun
I grab you and squeeze until your pores bleed
Manipulate the Earth that you formerly believed
Even after you're buried underneath the soil
Send a message to Hell, nobody grieve for you
Your physical mass is converted into ash

Spend eternity wit the underground forces

To beat me won't be easy, you'll face theses of Nietzsche
Blood'll apease me, raps are prehistorical
Cerebral a cathedral that leads you into the oracle
I'm horrible, I burn wit no time to react
Rewind DAT's so fine I pull spines out the back
In time I crack minds that's what the brain desire
Messiah pulls a pariah into the rain of fire
Barb wire around pagans that read the Bible
Genocidal and liable to just cleave your spinal
Final hours, the forbidden fruit they find desirous
Study rappers, bringin' wackness like Cabalah scholars
First in line to try to battle me, I left him limbless

Fuck all these players who can't hang, get a jockstrap
'Cause we drop bombs, better be scared
'Cause it's either hop on or be prepared for us to lock horns
We engage, when the pen sprays we wage war
And then you know what they say, when it rains it pours
So face us, 'cause you can't change the laws of nature
We independent, it's competition callin' us major
We major threats who deliver, so place your bets
We'll bring it minus the Moet, Rollies and Avirex
We just spit shit too amazing, just shit
That when you face it you'll see it's a must-win situation

The War of Gods and Men
I condemn them who believe
In ancient fallacies and the heresy of thieves
Burn the unholy in your filthy religion
Paganism and the prism of three-dimensional prison
I walk through the liquid of the Seven Rivers
And deliver rhyme schemes that cut like verbal scissors
Or arrows
The sacred science of the pharaohs
Millennium prophesies of tarots
Murdered cattle, discovered near the crop circles of the land
While we fight wars for political whores like 
Mary Magdalan
The Hologram plans his incision
Apparition of Tibetan black magicians
My compositions will turn men into slaves
Holographic aspects of particles and waves
Propel the spacecraft in the Pleiades
Dwell in the abyssal plains like the Horse of Hades
The Wheel of Infinity, the Chamber of the Trinity
Levitators of the fifth level magician of divinity
Like a pentadrone, 
I sent your dome into the forest
Of Ibilis
Like the wilderness of Tan

Encompass my soul in a beam like proton

I dwell in a body that can't be slain
The verbal flame, he atomic spark of pain
So I drain, the energy from your Chakra system
Watch me glisten like the sun
The Chosen One, The cyborg relation
My shit is crazy like Free Masons
Meeting camp crystal lake with Jason
Complex wind, City of screaming metal in the Vatican
I shatter him who walks on the plains of Hell
To sacrifice El, Young El, Young El
A dark fall for all who battle the mystic meditation
Face decapitation and material contamination
By the spiritual deviation
Translation of ancient civilization
Nonaton, overseer of law and order
The verbal slaughter, Hologram walks on water
Immune to illusion and scientifical blows
Armed with black magic, spears, and crossbows
Feeble attempts to apprehend the Hologram
Overstand, I kill man like Wodan
So no man step into the darkness of the set
Study with Chinese masters like Jesus in Tibet
Staff of Moses, urn of ashes
Morphing my soul into solids, liquids, and gases

Ark of the covenant and the holiest excursions
The search for the knowledge and the wisdom of the sands
The Hologram sends you to the abode of the damned
Immortal like vampires
Setting fires in the caverns of the unholy
Oh, the ancients all hope of Abraham
Send you to the sacred land
To change form, performing rituals that leave you scorned
Crown of thorns adorns the unborn in which you spawned
There is no shelter from the storm of Babylon's lost children
I lead millions to the promised land
The holy lamb, the planetary Hologram
Blowing your Chakras' to oblivion

Vanishing breed, the holy throne
Presidents of United Snakes are now clones
The zones of the virus, the eye of Cyrus

Teaching lost fools that Yeshua never dies

Good Lord, how we must look from out there
Our addiction is evil

My brain's on another level than yours
You could only comprehend half of what my memory stores
I only walk through the heavenly doors
And never tryna see the penitentiary walls
I walk barefoot on the equator
With the mental acumen of Bob Lazar
My frame can't be explored by y'all radar
My name can't be absorbed in God's quasar
So I ain't tryna stay around this Hell
Twelve thou from all the twelve tribes of Israel
They call me Ishmael, Lord of the Seas
I'll take your life quick, gone in a fucking breeze
You don't deserve to breathe, your brain thoughtless
While I remain in the same Spain fortress
But pain's gorgeous and love is torture
And anyone who tell you different is a martyr

It makes no difference what I do
Whether I draw blood or not
You cannot see God unless you are pure
Prove there's no evil and you can go
It's the violence of my will against theirs

I'm from the pits of hell escaping from an Egyptian cell
I dedicate this to the saints that's doing bids in jail
You fucking kids are frail and we the purest form
And the biology of magic is a gorgeous psalm
My deepest thoughts are strong and I'm unbreakable
You wouldn't overstand, you're humanly incapable
My appetite for blood is gruesomely insatiable
And I'm a righteous thug that's brutally defacing you

You just a fucking crumb, my clique is hustling jums
I spit a rap at you to liquify your guts and lungs

Fighting for the rights of Islam armed with two gats
But y'all knew that, we was coming for blood
And your body, the perfect specimen to put in the mud

You are only a vessel for our God
What are you afraid of?
Eventually everyone does the same
We're not evil because of the evil we do
We do evil because we are evil

I civilize the savages while you support gay marriages
Evil demons and the Jesus of Nazareth
I keep my blade more sharper than the cactus's
I keep grenades in my parka for the pacifists
And you can't lie to God, cousin
You can't lie to the great Master Fard, cousin
It's a facade, cousin, they wanna lie to you
They wanna tell you that the government's reliable
They wanna tell you that Islam is dangerous
When everybody know the Christians are the blame for this
Cause it's the truth, deal with it
But you complain every time I'm real with it
I'm 'bout to kill critics and then take 'em to war
And teach 'em how to put they love and they faith in Allah
Or I'm breaking their jaw or I'll take 'em to burn
Cause that's the only fucking way that the pagans will learn

Essence is revealed through praxis
Because you are not ready to receive it
It's not like we have any option

Tibetan Black Magicians,Visions of Gandhi,2003.0,"How dare they challenge me with their somewhat primitive skills
They're just as good as dead""
Jedi Mind Tricks, Canibus
Let mee do it like this y'all

I grab mics, bust the raw, take flight, adjust the yaw
I break your bicuspids with your own jaw
Metaphors started menopause in your moms before you were born
Technically you don't even exist, god
A flick of the wrist and you gone
Lost in limbo like pink shit camouflaged in a pig farm
I'm an enigma I rip bars, a burning star with 5 points
Plus the mic I ripped thus far
I start from your forehead, peel the top of your fucking face off like an orange then eat the carnage
My God that sounds horrid
Eating MC's is like eating garbage, they make me vomit
Discombobulate prostates, re-hydrate dry lakes
Wipe Ammonium Nitrate across the side of ya face
Anthropomorphologically speaking, I'm out of your league
Who can match the bottom of my top speed?
Scourge of the earth, verses immersed in the dirt
Heart monitors flat line due to data read error
Sentences go through re-synthesis
I leave em looking bleaker than Memphis is without Roc-A-Fella membership
Don't be an optimist and try to rock with Bis
You end up in an iced-out sarcophagus

Every rapper better fear me, 'cuz Vinnie Paz is a beast
And y'all steady screaming for war but want peace
You trying to walk through the fog with sun leaks
You trying to walk two dogs with one leash
You can't overstand the mathematics
How I rip bars, walk through walls, perform magic
Tibetan Black Magic, I'm a warlord
Ill stab you through your fucking temple with a floorboard
I'm a born lord, I was baptized
To see the universal through a cats eyes
Here come the black skies, it's all darkness
I breathe life into Jesus Christ's carcass

""Have you ever heard the sound of bones splitting""
""Make MCs memories whenever there's a symphony""
""End you with the murderous medley""
""Have you ever heard the sound of bones splitting""
""Make MCs memories whenever there's a symphony""
""End you with the murderous medley""

As I duct tape ya to the front of a Mack Truck's fascia
Drive through a brick wall, pull the parking brake up
Ask you for you proof of registration, say what?
I can't understand a word you saying, you fuck
Peel you off till you drop on the floor, drag you to the manifold
Make you put your mouth around the exhaust
Squeeze your neck harder when you start to cough
I bet you never thought this could happen just for pissing me off
I'm in for hardcore Hip Hop, the surrogate father
Protecting Rap like the exoskeleton of a Lobster
I'll moonwalk on water, harpoon jackers
And drag em back to the harbor for the local photographers
Now point four fingers and watch through binoculars
Look at what Harry Potter did to Andrew Galotti, kid
Bitter enemies exchange negative energy
But you can't forgive and forget with an elephant memory
Cause You-Know-Who snatched the mic from You-Know-Who
But lets keep that between me and you!
Me and JMT, Rippers that'll rip your ass
I got an empty mag, get em Vinnie Paz

I get a bloodlust when I see a slug bust
Hit your mug with a .38 snub and watch the blood rush
Nothings above us, ya'll better back off
Cos you a devil like the Canaanite in Sackcloth
We busting Gats off, it's a clean kill
It doesn't seem real when your spleen spill
So listen to what I'm spitting at y'all
La illaha, il Allah il Allah
Come on y'all, your getting hit in the chest
Cause Vinnie Pazienza and Canibus is the best
Ripping the rest and all y'all seek is ashes
I love reading Qu'ran in pitch blackness
I love reading the psalms to bitch actors
I love reading the palms of bitch rappers

Yo I'm quite calm, write my greatest shit when the light gon'
My hands fast, like Ramadan when the knife drawn
I'm the physical of a tsunami, you a slight storm
This is a spiritual anomaly, a fight song
To guard you now directly in my right palm
Nothing new about it, keep the ratchet with me lifelong
I come through polar caps melt ice gon'
My mother crying to my brother why his life's wrong
Concrete God's school - Allahu Akbar!
The crooked D's in front of the crib inside a parked car
Gumar-Oz-Dubar inside the shot bar
Darts fly at you and severe you like its a sharp star
If we ain't living in hell I'm telling you its hot, bar
Masonic manifestation of God is not far
In reality the sun is just a hot star
The Earth is just a bowl of shit that's where I stomp on

I am cyber, I'm a hundred miles of fiber
I am the proprietor of fire, I do not perspire
I fire as I so desire, I'm as dry as a fire and dire
I have tried impossible, I have gotten lightning in a bottle
My logic is not inside a novel
I am unconventional, incomprehensible, it's intentional
It's in general, it's in principle
Undesensitized to the cries
Blind eyes to demise
I'm despised by the skies
Likewise, I am sand and stone
I stand alone
I'm a candle blown, I have hands of bone
I am smart and old, I am dark and cold
I have a pawn shop of parts, I have a heart of gold
I'm a heartless soul, is my heart bestowed?
Death for all, let the closest star explode

As It Was in the Beginning,"The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological and Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness",1997.0,"To the angelic seventh cathedral
Relic illadelphia, write words of power
Him who was holy, who holds the key
That opens, no one considered
Since an initiate's sound of seven trumpets
Those Synagogues of Satan
Will fall down at my feet knowing I've awakened
I'm comin' soon for them, Elohim's the New Jerusalem
Puttin' millennium criticisms on christians
Two shall be revealed by the seventh cathedral seal
As above, so below. Behold David’s seal
Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?
Those who defame me shall keep open my wounds
No liars allowed in the school of Mogoon

Seven plagues of the seven angels
Seven emcees get strangled by the seven holiest triangles
I have mangled plexiglass beams that see through
Sons of Evil like Robbie Knievel
I believe you are the lamb prepared for the verbal slaughter
Save your breath like you was under water
I am torture like the fear of internationalism
Nazi eugenics and economic rationalism
I am the being born unto the scourge
And I am the being bringing holy wars
Orators from the womb of ill Yune
Glory be to the sustainer El Kuluwm
Gabriel fell from the steps of the heavens
Extraditing evil-rooted angels in the seventh

As it was in the beginning
So it shall be in the end

Black Tibetan abbot Abyssinians
That begins the extortiation of the fullations
Battle through the tombs of the Shangri La
Of Illadelphia Shambala, enter the paradigm
Of Rasul Allah Assyrian celestial Hebrews
Penance of the Etherians, hieroglyphians
I am the silhoutte, a risky 
The ill czar shine of two one five
Behold sons of limitless light, border rights
That reveal from the seventh heavenly hill
The book of el's, in jail, the apocalyptical tabernacle sacred
Satharotic, propheatical chapels
The synagogues of El Kuluwm, the ghost fills the monastery
Sanctuary cathedral, from the kingdom of Melchezevik
We the mystics redeem the Annunaki Elohim
We were originated from where? The blackness of light
Was formulated from our synapses
If you get tarnished in all phrases and salutation
To the mercifullness, glory of the Sunz of Mansion


Sink like the Titan', into the cold
Dark waters of the ocean, my thought modes
Shift Atlantis into motion
Elevated to rise beyond the shores, revelators
For episodes to the future, energy seekin'
Intruder, infiltrate the perimeter
Lock you in my initiation chamber
Prove to the guard snakes, not a stranger
With four large spiritual anger",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-as-it-was-in-the-beginning-lyrics

And if the bitch behave herself, I'll take her down to Katie Spade
You disrespect me, I Glock a pussy like Flavor Flav
The Ghost Rider, the coke whiter than mayonnaise
And you don't want an issue with the Kings
Cause muhfuckas walk around with pistols in they jeans
It ain't always superficial as it seems
Cause we had a little issue that was ripping at the seams

Keeping both eyes open for them jump-out boys

Been down since Disco 3, become Fat Boys

Where the blunt? Where the gat?
Where the funk? Where the strap?
When my killers with the pistol grip pump on your lap

This another hell storm, point blank mail bomb
The ambulance take you away and not Calgon
Dirt weed in a backpack full of Krylon
Move rock for yards without seeing the pylon
None of y'all could ever be on the level that I'm on
Traveling trajectories with crystals made of ion
Jeffrey Hunter need to find another place to die on
I don't know what drugs y'all muhfuckers high on
Whoever told you, you should do it, gave you bad advice
I'mma put a few in you, then blast you in the afterlife
You ain't even half as nice, bloodier than passion Christ
You want a body? Give me a pen, a bottle and glass of ice
I'mma do it my way, fish and edamame
Chase a very fine glass of wine with a latté
My music age well like it's related to Sadé
Vinnie put a few shots into 'em like Bombay

It's like you're crawling into your tomb
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies
Once the wraths get a hold of your soul
It's like you're trapped and there's nowhere to go
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies

I don't have the thought to care, it's off, it's my cross to bare
Lost the cross I used to wear, I am cost aware
Partnership with darkness, we're an awesome pair
Sought position, wall facing office chair
In the depths of hell, death for sell
With blood that propels from the cells and every L is extra L
It's hot here, hear the sears from the dropped tears
Its an opera to the ears, of gospel fears
Hot careers, grotesque, slow deaths
Here is where I am nobelist and oversexed
It's a whole mess of loneliness, no regrets
Unholiness corrosive mental Rolodex
I know uncertainty, personally
Murder uncourteously, mercilessly
Sole safe haven, open up my swollen heart
The hole greater than the sum of its broken parts

When you're falling into this tune
It's like you're crawling into your tomb
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies
Once the wraths get a hold of your soul
It's like you're trapped and there's nowhere to go
Deadliest of melodies, deadliest of melodies

I'm your worst nightmare, the reversal of Christ here
The only thing you seeing is the shadow and knife glare
Me, I ain't the type of motherfucker to fight fair
Pistol grip pump, chainsaw and a pipe here
Y'all are pussy watered down like a light beer
I don't run from it, I embrace it, I like fear
Texas-Chainsaw Massacre I invite fear
Call me Leatherface motherfucker I'm right here
Call me any other person that's an evil killer
Pazienza Pontius Pilate, call me Jesus killer
Call me Richard Ramirez because he spill venom
I'm Mark David Chapman before he killed Lennon
I was studying my lessons when the Earth was seedless
You're like Judas Iscariot when he murdered Jesus
The way my operation work is like a surgeon's thesis
I'll drink the period blood of a fucking virgin priestess

When you're falling into this tune

Still it smell too funny
The plot thicken, a lot of you die snitching
Ligaments missing, illiterate niggas die hissing
Why would I wanna trade my soul for your riches and lose to the Devil?

Lately I been behaving like I ain't got a baby
Maybe it's the way my lady treat me, crazy, shady thoughts
Run through my head by the minute but still I play my part
Peace to every piece of piece of shit, my piece of work
Is not a piece of nothing fronting if I'm bringing peace to Earth

Making a Killing,The Bridge & The Abyss,2018.0,"There's absolutely no trick to looking back on the great injustices of our time
And condemning them, we understand that, we've got that
The trick is always to look at what we're doing today
As if we're at some point in the future looking back
And figure out what the oppressions and the injustices are that we're committing today
And to get them out of our lives

Heaven said no
When you knocked out the door
Your fire could kill a child and a mom
Heaven said no
When you pointed your gun
Your face could make the joker wake up

Do you have compassion for everything alive?
Or animals don't matter to you, they can be deprived
Animals are individuals and have feelings too
They feel loneliness and happiness like people do
25 billion killed every year
The average person culpable for 90 plus a year
Overcrowded stalls, cages, and crates
No sunlight, no grass under their feet
They breathe, and they think, and they feel
But we feast, and we drink, and we kill
Factory farms inject stimulants and hormones
They're fed other cows, they're fed hog bones
Hundreds of thousands are poisoned and blinded
To test cosmetics for the small, small minded
The rain forests being destroyed to raise cattle
Wildlife habitat became the battle
They spray farms with herbicides and pesticides
You know how much poison is in insecticides?
The same chemicals destroy topsoil and leak into the ground and turn the ocean into oil
Genetically manipulated to grow larger
Only to be led to the slaughter
I don't see it as being a conquest
But people need to fight while there's still time left

Heaven said no
When you knocked out the door
Your fire could kill a child and a mom
Heaven said no
When you pointed your gun
Your face could make the joker wake up

Crash and combine the crates and tear them by the neck
They can't move their bodies and they could starve to death
They bang their heads from the psychological distress
Hellish conditions, that's not what I would call respect
Would you do that to your dog or your cat?
Do you really see the difference in a frog or a rat?
What's sacred to you here might not be sacred in Tibet
So who are you to say what should be eaten or a pet
It's a revolving door and it turn, you can't differentiate between the moral concern
An agitated pig might bite each other's tails
So they hack it off at birth and then they lead it into hell
Chicken beaks are seared off by farmers
But they call it debeaking, I call it torture
Boiled alive, you don't think it's karma?
Money come before mercy, that's the mantra
Cows give birth, their calfs are separated
Factory workers are either scared or they're jaded
The leather industry is tied to the meat industry
Inextricably they're both responsible for misery
A non-meat diet can slow the process of aging
Avoid toxic food, contaminants, and enslavement
Reduce global warming and end world hunger
So think about it next time you sit down for supper",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-making-a-killing-lyrics
The Apostle’s Creed,"The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological and Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness",1997.0,"I sit upon a cloud of nuclear waste
And taste the orgasmic juice of a goddess with her lips spread on my face
As I speak in space touching a damaged piece of a satellite
Resembling wrecking remnants of a 2010 soliloquy
Entity, centuries from the time of man designed a plan
Of a time span of seconds to an immortal
Transport immortals in portals toward an Egyptian land
To then erect complex architect structures and pyramids
Melted parted rock with acidic chemical blood samples
From a reptilian females' period, I travel like the Iliad
But my ship sails amongst cosmic whales and intergalactic pirates
Telling tales of trails left by the gods
Through the center of the sun when they passed the spot
Jesus Christ was really an ancient astronaut
I attacked mastodons when I crashed upon Earth in the Ice Age
And twice laid mankeys with assistance of sound waves
And psycho-kinetics, you can't escape the wrath of Apathetic
The time has come for man to die, not project prophetic phonetics
Fugitive prosthetic limbs for hairy crippled or rejected
Exoskeleton extensions of cybernetic inventions
Moving swiftly like a Thundercat, my hunger tracks rats on the train tracks
And when I rap on tracks I attract tremendous energy sources
Changing forms through metamorphose
I travel darkened corridors with orbs of light and torches
We ride away on apocalyptic pale  horses
And disappear as shadows in the forest
And disappear as shadows in the forest

Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Your whole aura is Plexiglas

I take hold of truth eludes me like sands through the cracks in my hands
Retaliatory silhouettes in apocalyptic lands
Nomadic by the second, but I can't let this stress get the best of me
Though it test me on a daily basis
And traces the tracks of my tears down my cheeks and over my lips
Taste the freedom but it seems like gravity
Has me chained to this pathetic land like Satan's left burning lake of Chaos
But yet I continue on with no tendencies in my subconscious
So right there's a contradiction, because I'm aware of these tendencies
So they ain't in my subconscious anymore
More like forces that I conversate with, halves thirds and fourths
That I sliced my soul into a percentage
I know you wouldn't recommend it, so I wrote this letter and never sent it
Cause my pain, is my pain, I won't trouble you with my own
Now I swim through waves of asphalt with no place to call home
Yan on the lonely island and see a plastic smile speaking gibberish
At varying frequencies, burn out the radio and television transmissions
Or simply audible voices who wear the robes of righteousness
Equilibrium is fucked up from data overload
Enhanced by the fact that I walk on a narrow road
That's more like a tightrope between wisdom and insanity
Seems like clarity is the ever elusive goal
When insanity has the help of the omnipotent force of gravity

Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Your whole aura is plexiglas

On the battleground you can go to war like Sudan
But I'm half-man and so you have to overstand
That the other half of me is made of liquid and steel
Ain't you sick and tired of people screaming ""keep it real""?
I'm powered by the ancients, spirit in the soul
It's war, and Ikon carries crossbows
But I toss foes through the center of the planet
When you battle me, you best be praying like a mantis
I will send you, through the depths of the Atlantic
To study transcripts of rhymes by the enchanted
Hologram, the verbal war paradigm
Traveling back in time to change the way y'all wack rappers rhyme
If I don't succeed you will bleed
The just punishment of the Apostle's Creed
This is hip-hop kid, shit is straight from the heart
You's an actor with a record deal trying to play the part
Like THAT, like that one time like that one time like that one time
Uh, my man Stoupe in the house like that one time like that one time
My man, Chico in the house like that one time like that one time
My man Yan the Phenomenon, in the house, like that one time one time
Ikon the Verbal Hologram, up in this muthafucka
Open up that third eye before I open it for you

I’m the guerrilla of Philistines, I’m living the killer’s dream
I just let the victim kick and scream
Get the blood and smithereens out with Mr. Clean
Separate your figurine into different dumpsters
I’m getting hungrier and I ain’t getting any younger
Niggas should’ve killed me, now the wait’s longer
And the incapability made me stronger
I’mma die in service, I serve a higher purpose
I ain’t nervous of what surfaces from wire searches
Mom sits inside a church reciting Bible verses
I’m entitled to idle my homicidal urges
I don’t prefer help, getting to the death quotients
It works by itself set in perpetual motion
But I remove it, there’s some probability to use it
Cause I might lose it, present company included

The street light is the only light that ever shine
Kill devils with metal from the Beretta nine
If I shine (I shine) heavy metal grind
Must be out your fucking mind, never question mine

You should never upset the man, the bullets the size of Pepsi cans
I am godly while y’all are doing the best you can
Me and Jus Allah lions and the rest are lambs
I am possibly atrocity in West Sudan
I’m humanism, I’m through the prism of western man
I’m pugilism, I’m voodooism, I bless the sand
My hands are made of titanium, I could wreck a van
Lazarus, I am from Damascus and I am Sham
I ain’t letting go until the fucking clip is done
Y’all offbeat, every word I speak hit the drum
The most beautiful thing to me is a glistening gun
I find y’all is entertainment while I’m sipping rum

I don't know a lot about science and chemistry
My enemies take a lot of time and energy
When I'm not shooting I get iron deficiency
And I don't wanna have the guys look at me differently
I would rather have a gun than an epiphany
Can't really rely on tricks and wizardry
When I get irrational, that'll be practical
Niggas don't believe shit it's serendipity
(x4)
Southpaw verbal jabs to the mouth y'all
Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that

Y'all in the presence of divine science
We don't subscribe to y'all theory of non-violence
I rule with an iron fist, I define tyrants
I went down the wrong path, that's despite guidance
Yeah and y'all are soon to bleed
And I'm from the house of wisdom Haroon Rashid
A goon indeed, ras-clat, Junior Reid
Y'all overstayed y'all welcome, y'all refused to leave
Refuse to see that the universe is deathless
I define rhyme with divine mind efforts
It's grind time, I design rhyme methods
It's high time y'all enshrine my records
And I don't know why y'all would fuck with the team
That's like standing on the block with no junk for the fiends
Pazienza
 
is in love with the deen
I would jump in front of bullets, shed fucking blood for my team
(x4)
Turn the other way cause you wants no part of that

I know what violence begets, timeless regrets
Silently sweat bullets when you ride for respect
Rivalry met (blam!) with the vibe you'd expect
Four-pounder makes you flounder only live on the net
You know the Internet thuggery, Internet fuck with me
Long enough to see my company sucker-free luckily
Paz heard me then scooped me,
 
spaz earned me this two-piece
Clash surely not rufees smashed girlies is groupies
The last rapper to move me, Ras Kass what he doing
Rap after the blood bath half of the movie
Gats strapped to my blue jeans, back smack to 
Djibouti
Backpack is with Uzis, Black Sabbath and Kool G
Point made like I'm sharper than a shiv
Stab wound when you think you sharper than you is
Charlotte's Web with the kids, only time we talk to pigs
I ain't talking courage when I say you getting jigged

Trinity,Violent by Design,2000.0,"I metamorph phrases to glaciers
Have 'em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have 'em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin' for too much
When minds put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead you're served trash
Ikon and Logic serve as my accomplices
And bring our own form of trinity to show y'all onto this
Rhyme patterns come across as astonishing
So I have all right to feel myself to the point of genetalial fondlin'

We the three emcees that rock that shit
Pick your 12 inch up and knock that shit

I spread around me a viral infectious faculties
Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
The effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Castin' the curse on fashion emcees Parisian fabric
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
The epitome of half-bent, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
Now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin' east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self-destructive explosive devices react before my mind is ever mastered
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Drainin' your plasma till your rhythm section hardly contorts
My stats in the orators sport
Draw more foolish queries, than the Warren Report
And the single bullet theory

We the three emcees that rock that shit
Pick your 12 inch up and knock that shit

Monosyllabic havoc that’s tragic will crystalize
Hit them guys, in they eyes with fuckin' shrapnel
Bomb they castle, 
set fire unto they chapel
Wrap my lasso, 'round rappers who wanna battle
Hologram with two bare hands crush you to gravel
Evil raps'll, reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, with my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my fuckin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated
The one who's seated, on the throne within a forcefield
Ya'll get tossed I'm the boss like Holden Caulfield
Raw deal,

Followed Solomon and prodded him at ya baptism

I am the reverse of Christ. I am horrible. I'm the worst advice
I squeeze coal in my hand and then it converts to ice
My whole world is cold blood. It's a serpent's life
I was fighting in Damascus with a Persian knife
I burn a motherfucker head. I'm in Hell's Kitchen
Fuck a cop, fuck a bitch, fucking Mel Gibson
The new wakata on the street smell different
I was rocking Jordan 7s while you sell Pippens
Everyone I trust in a box
So talking to y'all is just like talking to cops
Call me boxcutter Pazzi cause I walk with the ox
And though he ain't here physically I walk with my pops
Yeah but physically I walk with the Glock
And if an officer is shooting then an officer's shot
I'm a fat guinea motherfucker, walk with a bop
And it ain't never been a question if he soft or he not

Cause I gotta kill or be killed counter-attack 
Kill or be killed counter-attack

I'm out my motherfucking mind in a crowded line
Full-time murderer, no time to buy furniture
Rather re-clip burners than clip through the circular
Rather be a burglar than flip burgers
Any stitch of work will make me wanna commit murder
I am all thugs and drug fiends, screams and blood streams
Guns that can sink submarines, clubs and love scenes
Thugs in hot tubs, queens and umpteens, Vodka, Rock of Love
Angels and adversaries, Raspberry Absolut
Hash and grass, V8 splash, passion fruit

Stigmata and four gashes
We bashes the faggots who can't attack it right
Take their sternum and then turn them into my acolytes
That's the sight of blood that make a child stop
That's the rights of thugs that keep it wild hot
I hate you, say to pray to a heavenly father
It's fatal, like a NATO military armada
We hotter, warriors from Atlantis
Couldn't overstand how raw the Hologram is
The mantis who use the flame rod
'Cause y'all couldn't physically bruise the name God

Yo, the technique detrimental to your immune
Leave you in the dust, let y'all niggas choke on fumes

Shadow I cast is dominant, royal highness
North Philly's own homegrown champion
Purposely remaining unknown until shown
Cold as stone, the stage, my home away from home

Splatter your dame, Pharaohs, we shatter your brain
'Til a nigga's salary change to lateral game
Like Calgary Flames, putting fire on ice
Put me in Hell for putting four nails in Christ

I'm like Billy Goat Gruff under the bridge at Governor Ridge
Waiting to knock heads off, I'm a mean son-of-a-bitch
With an itch to misbehave and wave a switchblade
In front of your face so close to leave your whiskers shaved
To disengage or rip the pages from your notepad
Then shove 'em up the hole between your lower back and gonads
The only way your rhymes would be the shit
You need to read a script on playing gay 'cause you cats could eat a dick

Sucker MCs

Painting a picture with a paintbrush in water color of genies
Holding the key, vitality
It's all you need, if you're a different being
It will be a different color when you bleed
Accurately punctured from needles in you nervous system
Are like the seaman, not water soluble
Because of the attributes of yin yang is dual
When I cut you simultaneously like whang killing you too quickly
If I were to bang, witness thee, I hang you in aqua
Sending electric shocks to open up all your chakras
And when I do, the all set 
That will biochemically plant water beads on your brain
While putting salt water on open wounds to have you in pain

Four score, the verbal hologram is verbal war
Chinese water torture into your molecular structure
Ancient scholars wondering where they've seen us
Babylon's hanging gardens and the temple of Artemis
The Hologram crushing you to grains of sand
Lawnmower man, computer generated battles of the unseen hand
Internal bleeding, I bed my seeding with deadly arrows
Fly like sparrows, and get destroyed by the army of the pharaohs
Cyborg,  to the womb
Alive where you will see traveling loons from 
The ancient palace, the ancient chalice
Mystical like aurora borealis
The palace of pain, y'all  kicked up  in flame
Half Abel, half Caine, get slain by the verbal flame
Bring forth the sights of Anunnaki Elohim

Distributing gangrene throughout your team

When I hit the disc gong, the vibrations will start circulation
Of gongs, the body's meridians and everything
That has pores, even obsidian
With the creek moisture and this part of your torture
I'll anoint ya with libations pouring liquids and cleanse
And you'll feel as if you were diving in the ocean
And caught the bends
The elements of the seas to cure all disease
Now tell me if you're unpleased
I'll treat you like a dog and never wash off your fleas
Have you waiting 'till I fill your bowels
With a fish bowl full of frenzying and hungry sea monkeys
Suffering from internal mange
You'll have to consult to the I Ching for change

Look in the mirror of the soul to see exactly where the flaws be
Leaving your squad dead on the side of the road like Ennis Cosby
The Hologram eliminating the Earth's population
Matrix field bases of organic manipulation
Ikon dwell in the forest like the Ewoks
We rot for following the prophetic books of Enoch
The treetops hang over your cipher like a ninja
Within the perimeters of the disagreeable sinner

And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices

And my basement's an arrangement of different torture devices
Suf- Suf- Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water

Block and Vinnie Paz the debut gonna take your head) x 2
Regardless, regardless

I fucking hate God, hate everybody that worship him
You the gay rapper, put a fucking skirt on him
I'll fucking murder him; I got a great banger
I'm the opposite of love: kill, hate, anger
I'm the opposite of God love
I'm a vampire, drink blood from a wine jug
I'm a divine thug .38 you know
Vinnie Paz Brooklyn act we waiting to blow
That's probably the reason everyone hating us fo'
I wanna see bunny rabbits I'm taking your dough
I'm taking your heart, then I break it apart
I should've known that these faggots were snakes from the start
I'm amazingly smart - like Christopher Rios
You'll be swimming with the fishes Luca Brasi does
Mi gente amigos, I'm with Block McCloud
Vinnie P. Siciliano he pour the rocks in brown

(It don't matter who you pray to
He can't save you) x2

Be careful what you wish for, because the devil's listening
Block and Vinnie on one track it's like pure Hell is risen
Choosing to tune into this fire music self inflicted
Pure evil like that girl from The Ring in your television
Each verse is like a spell from witch's thinner
Your health is slipping, fire swells in the pit of sinners that melt your siblings
Suffer the little children of the land
Block is building a fan base that looks like the Village of the Damned
Taste the sulfur, ain't Gods to puncture like shrapnel
And make you suffer like sadist lovers- cut you like scalpels
Pluck your eyeballs with forceps, claim your firstborn unless
You pour a cup of lamb's blood on your doorsteps
Block and Vinnie Paz, the acting Jedi Minds
In a Satanic temple drinking the reddest wine
Smoking the ash of a pastor we bled mixed with ash and lamb's breath
To bring hiphop back from the dead

(Death is really just a prelude, we can raise the dead
Block and Vinnie Paz the debut gonna take your head) x 2

And I play everything real close to the chest
The 2016 Range Rover is next
And I walk through the Valley of Death with no stress
Marvelous money to murder y'all, gold bullion
Fifty dudes, parkside, killers wear skully on
That's the glass table that I'm putting your medulla on
Black trees, black ski mask, black uniform
The shiny black .45 is my bitch
Cause I understand that nothing in the world is a gift
Ain't no magic what I'm doin', ain't no Merlin in this
The stupidity the reason Donald Sterling exist (you stupid fuck)
I was eating pills with Van Morrison in Gloria
At the Waldorf Astoria, called shorty up

Hit you with thirty-seven stab wounds
Bury your body deep in earth inside a black tomb

I was robbing motherfuckers for they Starters

So I side with the Vietnamese Communists
If you with me motherfucker raise your arm and fist
And we can bust a fucking cap and see if God exists

And it ain't safe no more
Ain't safe in the motherfucking place no more
Get laced in your upper body, face and jaw
You the type of faggot we ain't got the patience for
We break the law, while we pay our respect to Allah

Swig to the wig, Belle vodka hit my rib
Corona beers with a slice of lemon first dig

Yo, I trust the pain, what I say is best
What my studio suggests, my life is a mess
Standing in the rain playing  Reign Of The Tec
A big bang in my dame, still claiming respect (Fuck)
Known for sunsets, know they go west
A rolling stone don't stay in no nest (No)
Fresh off the plane and played with no rest
No gang, so I came in the game with no vest
I keep it simple life officially free (Right?)
Rolling up tobacco with medicinal weed (Hahaha)
You hear the rapture in my laughter
Create greatness from the visions that I capture
I'm after the gold and after that platinum shit
I think I'm over that, cause that ain't gonna happen
In LA my whole life, so I am sick of the glamor
But I can make an order fill clicking on the camera

Check it, who wants to disrespect?
The undefeated, undisputed
Crazy hardcore, no sell out
Everyone in my circle is dominating

Sacrifice, born twice, the messiah and Christ
The height of the night, the darker the times, the brighter the light
The truth is often lost in the score
That pure life essence left on the cutting edge of the sword
Good lord, I grab the mic like a biblical staff
It's mythical math, baptism, miracle bath
Calligraphy is graphic, graffiti's scribbled in wrath
That'll split you straight down the middle in half
Or get your cantaloupe slipped in your jab
It's the expanded man, 'mano y mano' meaning 'hand to hand'
Each coward standing for nothing, they don't stand a chance
When reality falls heavy as an avalanche

Man of war, I don't chase trends, I make times change

I could smell pussy from the time you first walked past
Sosa told The Skull to kill Tony
And how you gonna ask for more, but still owe me
Some of y'all 'round the real, but still phony
The six by eight in the box is real lonely
I'm tired of these muhfuckers, that's in my coat tail
They're only in my cypher, cause they know that I sold well
Throw this rap muhfucker over the boat rail
Marciano and Shala, hope that it goes well
This traitor over here, he a snitch like Aven-o
And his career only seen on the history channel
I'm Cobain when he playing every riff in the flannel

Back in the day when I was poor, I couldn't afford a diadora
On ya case like your lawyer, think you run, you mistaken
Put all records to the side, and it's ya face I'm fuckin' breaking
Awake and innovate, and changin' shape like amoebas
I'm rollin' with stolen Tim, get slapped, match with adidas
We just wreckin', what the fuck was you expectin' from a minor
Put a bullet through ya chest, and see who next in line behind ya
Straight up and down, ya'll have a sermon and blew it
I have niggas wildin', as if they smoked' a gallon of embalmin' fluid
Grilling, want to be flipped like some shrimp on the barbie
I do my dirt up in Philly, chill in the hills of Upper Darby
Niggas that's rolling through my hood like a trooper
Come in numerous numbers pussy, I smoke ya then reduce ya
Crucify ya, I fucked Elvira, now I'mma fuckin' shoot ya

To recline, and steal my rhyme for check
Now the man ya facin', ya rhymes I'm erasin'
If you trip or get slick, I convict like Perry Mason

Mad raps, wax the disaster from the masters
Snatchin' up rappers, and takin' out actors
MC's can test gift but yo, don't pass the limit
You finished, so save the Die Hard image for Bruce Willis
Ya raps are a joke, but I put dope from start
Transform with the art, rippin' ya fuckin' mics apart
This is the rawest of words you've ever heard
My rap style superb, kicking nerds to the curb
It can't compete with the man when I freak it
The crew will get beat quick, so stay in ya seat bitch

Palm sized highs are the double a two shooter
Pernell Whitaker when he movin' with Lou Duva
The gold dots don't go in you, they move through you

Junkies everywhere sniffing goma like it's Sinex
Anybody who doesn't know the time should check their timex
I met Sean Price and rocked steady where the god rests 
Blood Runs Cold was recorded in the projects
The first record was too difficult to digest
Heavy on delirium and paranoia complex
Old motherfuckers still live in the past
And these young boys trash so I'm whipping their ass
Listen, my shooters push weight like a barbell
Never stepped on and it's cheaper than a yard sale

Dope, crack, guns I ain't happy till we all get some
Ain't nothing funny when the chopper gets drawn

Communion: The Crop Circle Thesis,"The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological and Electro-Magnetic Manipulation of Human Consciousness",1996.0,"I am he who walks beyond the cycle of Tan
A guinea systematic survey
On the heavens long before the spells of Kemet
I had advanced cosmos, journey apologist
Substantiate statements
I commands the aspects of creation
Astronomers can't even interpret my ancient civilisation
Of Andromeda, the Dragon of Dracos
Come touch the inner sun
I went forth, a life force out of the core of Epsu
Bring forth the possibilities of solar energy into infinity
Like a Nimbo; endless, trapped it, Kingu
A myth too ignorant like the Sumerians
Explorer of the solar system like Galileo
Bring the mist of Mahabharata
Celestial God symbolic to the disagreeable complex mathematics of the Hebrew Bible
Receive and transmit the letters of the Rasqiniaans
Who have seen the third suns
I am like Milutin Milanković
Who outlined the theory of ground philosophies
Messiah of all biblical tablets
Watch how the process of creation
Links with the measurements of time
Scientifical like a geologist
I bring the geological changes to the world
Like the prophecies of the Book of Revelations

The compartment allies
Now my device shatters the fusel anomas
And for my dialectical, destroyed innocuous in conquest
Travel beyond five dimensions
A cipher cytoplasm or phantasm
An archetype antithetical to atoms
I leave you vacuous like an Organtoron
Pulses facilitate my brain waves
Determining what planet I’m on
Cybertron transmit my Mhakabaraso over the sea of influence
Never neglect my nebular units
Stereo-material movements
Painfully cranials statisticals giving your cerebral cortex
Damaging demigods, crushing egos
Into which a wench began by extracting a transcortical
Connections of macros-manic animals
Caves of sleek stature, once sabbatical
Once bring drama, I’m bright on harrowing lava
Within the plexus from my anatomical
It gets darker, a sense of urgency
Enters the atmosphere with my excursion
In this microcosm, a third version
Specifically a generation of mutated
Warriors from the Nether that’s ‘Neva Antiquated’
My flux is like somatic stimulation
As macro-electrolytes converge
Eternal recurrence, my mentals merge
It's cyclical, but it revamps its own thesis
Reaching the premium blend in the communion

Follow me beyond the cloud
In the stratosphere to the House of El Huul
It should lead you to a place opposite my heavenly throne
In the temple of ancient Kemet
Who discovered the wonders and the 24 elders
These beings, the Rasqiniaans
Come to enlighten you with supreme mathematics
Dramatically stood – twelve disagreeable, twelve agreeable
Seven feet tall in diameter
These elders sit 
on the flight in the craft Niburu
Passing through the universe density levels
Heading straight for the wrath of Andromeda
Elliptical physical galaxy
Containing beings in the line of Dracos
Stomping on negative snakes like broncos
Create magnetic field around my aura
Incapacitating ships
Negative energy creates the spiritual slaughter
Where you dwell in the physical world is horror
My mind returns to Illyuwn
To inform the elders of the incident
In case of the need for assistance
To return to my epic form
From my physical, and see my soul arise into a sham
Hitting the arcs of cumulus clouds of Annun
I left my image of a crop circle
In the form of a galactical star map
Perhaps to another plane of consciousness

Through a series of psychological tests
I have been declared a demon
Traveling through dimensions
Fatal weapons leave you bleeding
Dissecting gray matter, doesn't matter in my cathedral
But how could you stand my Timberlands in your cerebral?
Faces of space probes be scattered through my mental
Acoustics in my chamber just endanger instrumental
Fundamental rhythms are symbols of eternal power
Get devoured by my infinite skills to disappear
Getting lost in the holocaust that rage between my ears
Complex like gravity, tragically and mathematically
I defeat your squadron black magically
Analyze the tangle as you get mangled by my triangular rhythms
Systematic rotations of my words cause cataclysms

In the farthest universal
At your communion Nefilim council
Beings come to some planets in your galaxy
That were most frequently visited
Because life existed there in various forms
And deities it was why they explore Mars
Gives meanings, Ahnk is Jah
Foremost to the firm land
Super friends of man, fore-prophesize sight
Tight with a photon of light, rubber band
Others in Orion, skies or heaven
Star sections, constellation ploughing towards us
Lending aid to help our Taurus
Routine, orbit on the slate, clean
Took a thousand, one for sure fall
Equinox a birth time deemed, the team of thirteen
Searching our rich natural resources
And minerals to take back after retrieving
Our responsibilities are fulfilled
Like the Onus of Annun and Enlil

Y'all don't shoot, y'all play with guns, you Gilbert Arenas
We ain't from the same pain, it's different procedures
Me and Jus the same veins and same intravenous
Yeah, I judge a man by how he dies
Stuff his ass inside a van then the coward dies
Jus Allah who I turn to in a scuffle
Muscle never turns to fat, fat turns to muscle
 
I'm the unforgiving, psycho-driven murderer - Ice Cube
I'll send you home in a body bag you fag - MC Ren
I'm the unforgiving, psycho-driven murderer - Ice Cube
I got a problem solver and his name is revolver - Dr. Dre

My niggas will put your dome in a wall from one phone call
Trying to be such a fucking know-it-all
Niggas pop a hole in your boy, put you with Pope John Paul
Shove your body inside of a hole in the wall
I survived every close call, keep the guns loaded to brawl
It's the overall protocol
Y'all just throwing a whole lot of shit at the wall
I'm throwing a mix of nitrogen and glycerol
We get the pistols from the Big and Tall, you in the trash
Your phone got a million missed calls
I'm with half an ounce and a whole lot of alcohol
I'm blacking out, I'm always around the outlaws
Day in and day out it's murder on the menu
As your team searches for missing persons continue
I'm in blackness where black magic is practiced
It's the habitat where my gat's the happiest

Take his batiman hard like I'm snatching it from him
He ain't smart enough to understand assassins is comin'

And that whopper go (ta-ta-ta-ta-ta) shoot through the room

You wear a gun, the beast 'til the end that is
This is the twilight winter
I am ready to be her son
It's now, I will rise to her side!
I don't need the words, I'm beyond

Keep it homie, this is a gangsta party
Bullet proof glass Ferrari
Die sorry, by the hand of vampires and zombies
Fire bombing, suicide army, God's inside me
Ride till I motherfucking die high in Canarsie
Unfocusable, exploding smoking toast to you vultures
Soldiers in hemoglobin, words of evil spoken invoking
Volcanoes evoked, these veterans are very violent
Non Phixion, Jedi Mind Tricks a deadly virus
I could just go live no love, I read Kaballah on drugs
Gun in my wig, getting my dick sucked
Bitches spitting cum on each others clits for kicks
Cocaine tits, degenerates smothered in shit
Another day in paradise surrounded by bloodsuckers and parasites
Getting in shoot outs for Amorites
Leave ya block flooded with blood, it's horrifying I promise
Eat shit, suck, fuck, kill and die honest

The big bad fearless wolf
I'm the end of the world
Wearing the flesh of fallen angels
I've scanned the reality
I see it, the corruption of flesh
And blood to you all!

Call me the rap Che Guevara, lounging in the black grave's terror
I lace tracks with terror forever smelling death
Reoccurring nightmares of burning flesh
Must be the spirit of Koresh that keep me turning in the bed
Troopers hovering, you'll be suffering, crews be bugging
When they rather shoot they brother than abuse the government
Our crews make covenants from writing darkness
When we spark this, the hardest part is when Gods is
Dealing with fake artists, I face charges for speaking my piece
Unleash the beast after nine eleven still got beef with police
Street's a warzone we more prone to violence and greed
No voice leaves no choice they trying to silence the seeds
Time is when will you get yours, stop relying on me
I'm firing with speed so before you dying you'll bleed
This is a war call, I warn y'all, stay up, build your health
Or get fucked up, cut up ya wrist and kill yourself

The flesh of fallen angels come to me all!
A secret, living on by the skin of reality
I am the wolf!, 'til the end
I don't need the words, I'm the beyond the words

The street is Vietnam
, I'm like Jesus trying to complete a psalm
I believe in Islam, heathens can bleed till they gone
It's on, anyone can get hit
Anyone can get the center of their energy split
My enemies fit to face Palestine
Y'all bitch rappers only got heart on Valentine's
And all of y'all that wanna know how my metal feel
It gets settled in the temple when my Beretta kill
My pen bleeds the ink y'all spill
But y'all still seem to think y'all real
Jedi Mind real put the nine to ya grill
We spit real and y'all run for the hills
I stab you in the back till it weakens the knees
Then smash you with a statue of Jesus that bleeds

I've tasted the devil's green blood
It runs in my veins
I've seen beyond the world
The architecture of blood and bone marrow
Death is coming!
I have tasted the flesh of fallen angels

I exit out of my sarcophagus, fourth Horseman of the apocalypse
For my esophagus breathes a evil that just demolishes
Abolishes, to the darkness of Mephistopheles
Mental enteral that went through an ancient acropolis
Conquered this, from a fetus to genius
Took DNA from the Shroud of Turin and cloned Jesus
Merciless leaders, the 19th galaxy
Born to a storm on the seas of Gallilee
Battle me and suffer whiplash from my apostles
Leave you in shackles in the castle of Nosferatu
Ikon is hostile and mortals cause contusions
Hologram is known for placing poison in Christians' Communion
Slash, with the actions of ultra-violence
Crucifixions, indiction by Pontius Pilate
I walk naked in the house of David with pride
Force you to bleed just to make sure that you're still alive
Crystallize, we keep it live, y'all can't see me

I break in half, Satan's staff with ancient math
I wait and laugh, create a fuckin' blood bath

Mad expository expedition in your auditory

Your mind's eye is blinded by my battle raps
Like cataracts, your habitat is Halifax
Once I run you out your native city
Shea's committee is pretty witty we show no pity
I deflate the second-rate, wack MCs who replicate
Every trace of Esoteric found up in their record crate
I devastate, homosapian metabolism
Like human cataclysms and read them with an anachronism
My precision makes incisions on your acrotism
Battlin's a bad decision leaving you with aphorisms
I whip ass like masochism dominatrix

To fake kids, fifty dead MCs to my credit
Learn from the druid better known as Esoteric

In this the final conflict high powers and commandant's to enlist this
The fluid I spit is viscous, without so much as whispers
And with the swiftness of what your transistors can carry info
A widow's left where your wrist is directly cut by my discus
Forged upon the anvils of Hephaestus
With the hand skills I slam your damn grill
Executin' Greco-Roman holds
Roll in Trojan battle gear, explodin' through the atmosphere
I saddle fear and read cerebral centipedes as evil steeds
The feeble fleed
Holdin' severed rapper's heads toward the sky as the trophies to be viewed by the mischievous eyes of Loki
I hated your verse so I went back in time and waved a dirk at your mother's warm uterus
To kill you before you were born like fried yolks
My ammo splits the trunk of petrified oaks
It's time to die folks
You think that I joke?
I leave your thighs yoked
Your wrists are broken, tied to horses
You quartered, as forces pull you in opposite directions
Dissection of my anatomy, will lead to the unveilin'
Of what had shielded a tiny toddler wieldin'
A giant computer body, which is similar to Robotech

Yeah, yeah
It's been five years since you've been locked in the bing
And not to mention all the fucking drama it bring
You always in my heart and that's a beautiful thing
Like warm air flowing from a beautiful spring
But that's some wild shit to do to a king
And maybe some day I'll get used to the sting
For now I'll been thinking about you everyday
And how we use to dumb out in every way
Brought a smile to my face all the hardest of days
And praying that your mother and your father can raise
Your little brother into a man one day
I'll stay in touch with him so the plan won't stray
But don't you worry about your little brother, he fine
He smart with a heart and he steadily shine
And if the little soldier  ever step outta line
You know I'm gonna be there to show him the time

So what the deal cousin? How it feel right now?
I'll be there soon so just chill right now

Yeah, it's Vinnie Paz
You know I'm saying, Jedi Mind, I'm holding you down baby

I'd rather walk these hallowed grounds with a Glock or 
four pound
Police looking over my back when the Glock is low down
With a clock that slows down, it shoots flock with no sound
And I carry the weight on my back like a stone popper party
Lying till my soul hurts (soul hurts)
Mad as fuck, scared and stuck, I can't control earth
Surrounded feeling like a cold hearse wanting to fold first
I thank my peeps every day because they chose work
I'm totally grateful, at times I act hateful
Ya'll risked y'all freedom for me to reside in a gold cradle
Brown paper bag living in the latest whips
Trips to 
Epcot Centre
 in the spacious shit
Always reminisce about the shit you laced us with
Always the street legend to the bravest cliques
And now I see niggas getting it, it makes me sick
The same shit that could've made us rich, made 'em snitch
Divide the men from the boys see what makes them bitch
To watch loving mothers struggle just to raise her kids
Soar my mind every time that I raise this fifth
And drink the bottle till it's hollow and it all makes sense

Smaller brains

Harder to obtain, refrain
Unguard your gains
All things obtained are in vein

Uncoy deploy noisy toys

Dead prey on display
Let the slain lay where they may
Tell 'em how to ban their fellow man
Settle, tell your land
Quell your well in advanced plans
Grace your acquaintances with your complaints
Stated on the page letter
Awaiting the greatest ever
Better late then never
Better you in a crate
One state lesser
One day deader in red shaded decor


The bullet quicker than lightspeed,open gates of Midian in Nightbreed

Hell is hot and that's where the homing device lead
The body or the head only thing my knife need
I don't need to speak Vinnie's philosophy known
Y'all are weak and talk sloppy like Bobby Chacon
Blood shed and war anti-christ the prophecy shown
I tried to tell you that the Bush's were possibly cloned
You should know about distortions of lessons in college
About the water-fuel cell, the suppression of knowledge
I don't call that mother fucking professor a scholar
I call him a profiteering liar obsessed with the dollar

Why we in a jam when all that we want is Obama?

I'm a hellraiser, beautiful mind that smells hatred
Yell phrases, spit heat and melt faces
Excel gracious, rugged terrain on hell’s pavement
Drinking from god’s well until my chest cave in
Wes Craven, nightmare,
 iron maiden
Keep the iron blazing in this dying nation
Ninja Gaiden, throw stars in constellations
Bars abominations out of satan's basement
From the land where football fans will beat the shit out you
Nuns get beat with hammers til they spit out jewels
Pits that walk astray and take a rip out you
Niggas spit clips and walk away cause they don't live by rules
And I'mma make my presence felt every inch I move
Box game is evident from all the clicks I bruise
Rhyme game is heaven sent, don’t make me rip y’all fools
Or we can pass this mic around and watch your squad get chewed


Don't ever come to me with war
I've severed scores of orators
Rappers fall onto all fours like minotaurs
With Jedi Mind and the Planetary be bombing this
We staying one step above you like a pharmacist
With Ominous, detonate the bomb
Heads dread, hallucinogenics, and Vietnam
I spit a psalm, create bombs like an Iraqi
Swear on the bible and then lie to Ecclesiastes
(Assault and battery)
Battle me that'll be what splits you
Store enormous amounts of energy in a crystal
We boa constrict you, the gods are militant
You faggots couldn't go the length like you was impotent
You ignorant, your whole click is split in half
You step in Allah path, and face Allah wrath

Anybody think they can't test the bol, prolly
Word bond, this is the best, that Sean Connery
We pure, come from the chest of Bob Marley
Abstain from the ways of the flesh, that's not godly
Cube started out on the west with my posse
No pork I don't  put mess in my body
Bullets gonna rip through the vest like hot saki
Always gonna give you the best, but not Robby
Everything herb and liquor like hot toddy
We gon' trick 31 like Rob Zombie
You can't control the drum, you rock sloppy
I don't play second fiddle, I'm not Scottie
If Vinnie gonna spray the block, he rock shotty
The .45 caliber kick and stop Roddy's
Weisenthal loaded the clip and shot Nazis
Now to rhyme, made a decision and shot Ghandi
(Chorus: Eamon)
Please don't make me feel like I gotta bust a shot. Hoo!
(One two) Shot

Please don't make me feel like I gotta cock this nine. Hoo!
(One two) Nine
Hah hah
(Verse 2)
There's no choice wielding here, salute Generals
Cops trying to get him on lock to boost Federal
They said Vinnie one of the best but too technical
When I tried slowin' it down it's too sensical
The covenant dark in the soul, the Blue Sentinal
Call this little 9 a dime and shoot ten at you
The mark that we made in the game, too indelible
God made dirt, and dirt produce vegetables
My heart pumps, runnin' the lane, you move minimal
It's octopus slums so beware a few tentacles
The rhyme too fine and the wine too delectable
My voice wave stronger than yours, it move decibals
Manowar making it loud and move decibal
The snare don't knock and the kick is too minimal
Sayin' that you're better than dirt is too literal
Straight left over the jab induce medical
Muerte

Terror,A History of Violence,2008.0,"Y'all motherfuckers woke a demon up
The bullets splatter through your spleen and guts
The whole clique duckin they PO
They need to pee in cups
We murder shit like everything the Europeans touch
I dont even talk to motherfuckers, that could lead to trust
We on our din, devils only deal with greed and lust
Beat an elephant with bare hands and take his bleeding tusks
Anytime you hear a cop was murdered best believe its us
Jus Allah load the Glock put em in the weeds and dust
I ain't I sucka I was born with hercules in us
Strangle snakes, dangle grapes fed by European sluts
Yall know where to come to when you need the fuckin trees and dust
Ayo D?? I need by ?? these fucks
I got the power to devour trees , seas and such
I got the power thats the caliber of jesus touch
It dont matter the caliber I proceed to rush
Vinny on a whole nother algebra than the Greeks could touch

Let me tell you a little something bout a nigga named Moz
Look in his eye you could see the evil if you high
You could notice a little nigga that's eager for the sky
Behind bars scarred like jesus when he died (when he died)
Nigga I was in the hole for a whole 6 months getting high off the reefer thinking why
Im with the roachs and rats hopeless and ?? line and line and the hole in the crack
Nigga I was in the hole trying getting my back, niggas snitching and CEO tried getting my bag
But I dont give a fuck about a snake or a fag a hater id rather see Adolph paid off, laugh
This is real life fuck getting paid off rats And selling my soul to the devil getting paid off rapping Mozerade, Maz , Pazienza clap boys ?? back man you still screaming duffle bag boys

I have lived a century, I've tapped into my 6th sensory
I am a potential enemy
My entire inner chemistry, every inch of me, is divinity
Unequivically supremacy
I have undesired energy
Sins friendly since empty
Show the prince of peace no clemency
Give him an extremity of insensitivity
Let his kin and ministry witness his disassembly
I just love sufference, I'm destructive, unproductive
Tussid, not much substance, thuggage
Above judgement, unaware of any error of doubt
Where it counts, I'm a fair amount of paramount
I embody a monopoly of ungodly
The hobby robbed me of my common camaraderie
My apology, arid, insincerity
Charity, very generic, it's hilarity",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-terror-lyrics

I got shooters from the bottom that will hit him for a band
I will chastise a disbeliever, hit him on his hand
Survivalist, I'm telling you I'm living off the land
Afghani indica I'm paranoid as dollar sign
Young boys will shoot this motherfucker like it's Columbine
Equality and fairness an injustice of the paradigm

It's no telling when the felon will clap
Donatello, I will leave a fucking shell on your back
Body in flame you gonna need a Relafen pack
See my money long I'm talking about an elephant stack
Tall man undertaker, haul 'em and I bag 'em
You getting close to fire, B, you talking to a dragon
I will line 'em up and let them know the whopper will blast
And the bullets hit a tree it's gonna chop it in half

The Letter Concerning the Intellect,The Bridge & The Abyss,2018.0,"Vinnie the chin, 
my mentor was Genovese
Prada kicks the same color as fettuccine
He tried to test his loyalty like 
Adebisi
Nothing in common with anyone who had it easy
This motherfucker talking guns when he had a BB
In the tomb of the vizier with Nefertiti
We honorable like we Tuskegee
Bear claws and a buckskin leather tipi
The hollow tips burn slow like they're pepperoncini
I'm with Broken Matt Hardy and the seven deities
Make salat so my soul will reset
He a plug so I let the fuckin' modem connect
Y'all got me confused like I givva give a fuck
What y'all consider being on the up I call beginner's luck
You's a small fry, Webster Papadopoulos
Everything from here on released from you is posthumous

Yeah, the Gucci luggage is a rusty brown
I need some fly shit to check into this dusty town
I told you I don't fuck around
I be in camoflouge gore-tex shorty in a lovely gown
It's not a home if its occupants died
He could take this fucking shot like his doctor prescribed
How the fuck it's logic to him if his logic is lies
With his miracle and Kabah and philosopher's eyes
Mulberry silk is the favorite fabric
Inshallah bring peace to the asiatic
While your wife is a basic savage
Your body transported on wheels like a baby carriage
Disrespectful I will mush you in your face
Because disrespecting you is how I put you in your place

It's a dirty job but somebody gotta do it
My style is wild like pitbulls trapped in cages
Made the church people on your block wanna move out

Every rhyme I write is 25 to Life
Every rhyme you write don't even deserve a mic
Crossing international borders with a bomb threat
You motherfuckers haven't even left your block yet
You're a bitch, you're a ho, here's a prom dress
You wanna try to box with God it's no contest
So keep on thinking this shit is sweet
I'mma start a sandstorm and put you under the Middle East
You got it fucked up homie, I've been a beast
Reptilian tongue and my skin is deep
Rumor has it they say I'm thrown off
Until their limbs is everywhere, wigs is blown off

Is that the cast of a death mass?
Is that water in a red glass?
Why, I'd thought you'd never ask, it's as legend has
There's a method to the mad, it's direct and fast
Disconnected from the guest it's a second-class
I have left a trail of debt, checks in the mail
Heads or tails, death prevails, never fails
I will never get derailed, that tip is stale
I will never get to hell, that ship has sailed
I'm refined, mastermind after cash and kind
Hand me gunshot pantomime, axe to grind
Pass into the sublime have a laxing time
Have a glass of wine, have your last act of kind

Everything they say is irrelevant
I'm an element of rap that defines pure elegance
Elevating my residence, bigging them up
I'm in the hood rocking JMT shit in the truck
Not I Against I because I don't sleep on my stomach
I rock Heavy Metal Kings and watch the barrel of the gun twitch
You're talking dumb shit, hooting and hollering
I lift the cannon and wait for the bazooka to swallow them
I'mma do this regardless of them, I'm the original
Dirty rotten scoundrel surrounding your pinnacle
Block the perimeter, I'll hit you with the fadeaway
Got a bullet with your name on it for a rainy day

So many days, so many nights
So much money got fucked up, so many fights
So many niggas got knuckled down for no reason
So many cowards got guns but don't squeeze them
Yeah, that's just the way it is
I finally got a whiz that's ready to bless the sun with a hundred kids
So I can fall back, Ralph Lauren straw hat
Sour Diesel already showed you I'm all that
I won't stop trying to ride on you assholes
First week sales donated to Daschel
You think I'm bugging right?
But it's these zeros in my bank account
That got me saying ""Nigga, floss it right""

My brain's vast as the sky is
My heart doesn't know what die is
Pyromaniac rap, Vinnie starts fires
Only an ignorant thought ignored Osiris
And that's why the enemy lost and caught virus
Where I'm from Gods, Earths, 85ers
Y'all ain't got heat underneath it's all wires
I'm on some Samhain shit with bonfires

I sent the alarm, to let you know Godzilla was spawned
I'd kill for my moms, ain't nobody as real as my moms
And it ain't any woman ever know the deal like my moms

Bashing ya face, tell ya army, get back to their base
C'mon cousin, that's how we get down
We the only reason that you eat and breath in this town
We beatin them down
Raise a blade, buck 50
I rap like no one out there can fuck with me
Stuck with me, we ain't leaving the game
And keep it dirty cause we never had a reason to change
We keep it the same, start a war with the Glock nine
And thug like a mob, and rock mine
So let me speak the truth again
The ancient babylonians were nubian
You need to watch what you read in your class
Cause the devil try to have you all repeating the past
I'm ready to go to war for Mumia
Fuck George Bush and his war, we gawn see him

I'mma reign now, giant fist-splitted james brown

Lines are loaded
Shine decoded the vote and flow and showing signs I wrote it
At a auction, B, style cost some g's
Challengers eyes makes tears like the Force MDs
Percee P, that's me I get nasty
Rock it flashy, pass me the mic, it's your ass, G
But I make threats, tape decks at my apex
Packing latex, and safe sex with chicks and stricken paychecks
Killing ya, fillin' ya with rhymes similar
To bullets in the cylinder of a dillinger spillin' ya braincells
I'll blast ya later, you be readin' essays
And be there next day like JFK's assassinator
Nobody, ever went to represent
It's evident why you hesitant cause I take every cent and your hottie

Anybody holding any money should drop that
We shot back, spit a gospel of force
And burn ya'll, with my philosophical thoughts
We're just tryna bring the raw shit
Smoke a L, drink a forty on the block, raw shit
The hardcore shit, for ya'll to dumb out
Standing the back of the club and pull the gun out
Everybody run out, the sun out, it's over
I'll take it back to the past like Sankofa

Yea, it's vinnie paz baby. Stoupe - The enemy of mankind
It's like a brotherhood, it's all blood
It's all love baby, it's all love

Respect what you see as if you praise Donald Chief
And understand my plan is to prosper till deceased
And let my bank account increase until it over flows
In pathfinder jeeps, organized and blunt patrol
And never indulge in petty shit that's irrelevant
Thousand dollar shopping sprees just for the hell of it
Drinkin' daquiri's in the back of caravans
And finally got the chance to live my lifestyle advanced
And keep my mind clear of poisonous stunts and beams
Be deep meditations, now I see where pagans dream
And do time, around and get mine
So I relax while you stress, try to follow the rest
Never the less, I finesse, teach moves like it's my last speech
My thoughts on the future, cause it don't equal the past
Niggas steady plotin', your every move we be watching
There's no room for error, once you slip, your forgotten
A never hasbeen, in a world of frame and fronters
Who had to learn the hard way, how disease can take you under


Mall master be coming at you, that nigga that curse a lot
Shit, I even reverse a rock, I be theivin' ya purse with Glocks
Rushin' against your garment, daily Hailey Comet, a bomber
Punk, you wanna fuck wit funk, have you breathing out ya armpit
My guns that weighs the joint, don't even hand a malla' nina
Have niggas tits and too-toos, and on point like ballerinas
You can bring ya best to west, found dressed in some rugged shit
You blind, ridin' on my dick, don't know who you fuckin' with
(From Crooklyn to west side Phil, we keep it real)
So if you squeal on the reasons, for these heavens squeezin', the steel
Slow subliminal criminals strangle triggers that's identical
Mangle bitches that's fly, die with my dick inside ya genitals
(Sendin' you through shit you never thought of
The don who bust the sawed off
So recogize, I squeeze and then ya life lost)


My raw essence is forever present
But my team be chasing dreams of cream and digits in the sevens
The heavens, see my body is holding effervescence
My verbal tecture will bless you with scientific lessons
On another plane, it's hard to maintain
Cuz my membrane, causes strain within my inner frame
The pain, from my people that be involuntary
You in this game for this love, dunn, or monetary
Forever keepin' the spirit, 
so like Elijah
My verbal fire, will resurrect you like the great Messiah
Desire, is like the law of the siren song
Arm Leg Leg Arm, my word is bond, so I move on
And stay strong like Egyptian Kings
Rockin' diamond rings and things that it brings
I spread the science, to all the planets, I'm hard as granite
You need the knowledge of God, dunn, to understand it",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-onetwothree-lyrics

""The rapper Ikon be throwing cerebral blows in telepathic forms""

Complexities break entities when hardcore be the factor
Physically shattered by the cause of the megacosm distractor
Fractured by my supernatural forces, face losses
As I break backs like Superman on horses, word ajar
Ancient warrior like Thor
Spiritual like the Ibis god Thoth
Complex construction by the technician will dismantle your collective mind
Enemy of mankind, with Egyptian archaeological finds
Dwelling in the dungeon of time
Monomaniacal beat seeker
Swarming like locusts into your speaker
Examining your communication system with cybernetics
Key notes of my flows or get froze with cryogenics
East coast domination for the D-U-B massive
Gathering at black masses to gain knowledge of the clashes
Of past rhythmic masters
After the smoke clears, brain matter is discovered
Smothered by my soundscapes that have left you dismantled
Enchanted by my verbals as Ikon be burning candles

Emerging from the mist is not an individual but four
Hardcore concepts causing everything to be raw
8804 AD causes misery that be abominable
Evil like three times hexagonal
To test my squadron and watch your macrocosm turn to particles
Non-particles are non-particles
Like the nucleus of an atom
The corpuscles which carry the oxygen from the lungs gather patterns
Energy from the soul, black hole, like spirit of Kukido
Sun, black circle of one, level of gravity is none
Transformed by gods of sun
Industrial power get devoured by the demonic
Read the fine rhymes with mental war games like Matthew Broderick
Revive shit, or live shit defy the carcass
My war sons and born sons revolve around darkness

Spiritual violence leave your alliance in microscopic fragments
My circle of darkness is ferromagnetic
Suffer Chinese water torture, my word is water
Transcendental planets will vanish like  daughter
Hypnotical regions in my mental, a rhythmic cycle
Recitals of euthenic theories have been retitled
To be digested by the masses, I smash kids with verbals
Gortex through your chest causing incidental murders
Of weak minded emcees getting caught up in my hurdles
Of chemical disruptions by sodium chloride, potassium, denatonium benzote
Ultimate sacrifice to the gods bloodier the kings
Son of Barada, know the mode of darkness like Bhagavadanta Prabhupada
Infinite light, space and time rhyming physics

Murder innocent people for Uncle Sam's law
Everybody know it's all over oil
It's all for the greed and the money that ain't for you
It's all for the head of the state that ain't loyal
Off with the head of a snake, he ain't royal
He gave two-billion dollars to the Taliban
And young Americans dead before they had a fam
Look, I don't got beef with a war
I got beef with a war mistreating the poor
I got beef with everything that he do
I got beef with the lies misleading the youth
And I'm about to take the law in my own hands
And I'm about to aim a

 at a grown man
North, south, we should ride up at night
Black masks, black tape, black gun to his wife

And we could start the onslaught for all they criminal ways

Where my

She heard gunshots and she knew what's next

If the bitch make a move, dump a clip in the whore
She ain't moving, that bitch took a piss on the floor
And she ain't getting nothing else except a kick in the jaw
Tell her husband we need more money for poor folk
And to respect others like the book that Allah wrote
Nah nigga, I ain't with that deal
Put a bullet in her head and let him see how it feels

Because they all, they all start at a dollar
The guy that showed you that beat and it becomes so popular
He got it for a dollar or 50 cents, he didn't pay two hundred dollars for it (he payed 50 dollars)
And you know, he didn't pay anything for it
He payed a dollar, two dollars
Five dollars, tops
Now all of a sudden the fucking record is two hundred-something dollars

All you dirty mothafuckers should be honoring me
It's been twenty years of tryna take my aura from me
What you see as glamour life is like a horror to me
I ain't tryna lead a crib, it's always drama for me
That's the reason why I always got the lama on me
Cause they tryna hang a motherfuckin' charge over me

And that's natural in a city with crack statues
Please believe it, gun shots some keep secrets
You keep sleepin', get caught in ya Jeep preachin
Always listen to an old man when he speakin'
To learn how to keep police agreein' on the weekend
Learn how to analyze a man when he creepin'
Learn not to never burn a bridge when you leakin'
That's street knowledge, write it down and speak about it
Drug dealers use this rap the street outfit
I leave doubters in the back and move outwards
Watch for them niggas with Timbs and loose outfits
Guns don't kill people, the bullets'll kill people
And bullets leave holes in people you just see through
It's all mathematics it's what the streets equal
These streets evil, city niggas with Desert Eagles
They won't hesitate to drive-by in tinted regals
And that's how it is in my life, that's how it is
(Yea, it's Rocky Raez y'all, the Ghostwriters)

Heyo, what's really good? (We over)
'Cuz I got it on lock (In my hood)
We hustle what we could (In yo' block)
You niggas ain't stop (In my block)

(talking during chorus)
I got the sound right reasoning of Malachi York
Only speak to me if I allow you to talk
Cuz y'all ain't never learn that you crawl before walk
My four-pound layin' you down like Black Hawk
The gat's smart, intelligent born vicious
Military thug who follow Allah wishes
That's why I don't eat pork, it cause sickness
And that's why literal cats is like bitches
And y'all be more hard pressed to stop me
And fiends dummin' out on the block, it's rock free
So fuck peace, cousin bring me to war
So I can have blood on my hands with C-4
I need more, need weed and need cash
Or I'mma shoot three at ya team like Steve Nash
You bleed fast, 'cuz that's jus how it go down
That's how Vinnie Pazienza always holdin the crown
I'm holdin' it down, with five nickel nine biscuits
I live my life for Allah, defy Christmas
But y'all always in Jedi Mind business
Now your body parts are buried in five ditches

Adjust of bust to attacks the crowd
The simple fly, plus arrows, I rush the format
With four blind shots to ya verbs and pronouns
These herbs'll slow down, with terms to sicken a guitar
Dip live and you just the point to ball
For sharp lines, make keen, the blast to catch phrase
Overdrawn by the crowds who strikes amaze
Never float like me, and oddly never lose a few
So bear wits, to appreciate verse such as that
Initiate words to come back, over tight
Nah, I'm different from these war heads
More treds on my adjectives
Allow full side steps, to deflect your ships
Then he make a true vowels, with volume, see I'll
The prospect tunnel, for me and Asan, Ikon
We rock broad neck, funnels to collect
The drips and moss, giving y'all punch and serves
No conundrum to our attribute of five foot
And the least to serve, with over stridal shoots
Indeed and they relax in conforts
They need to form and  words to lose any casual sense
Of well being, yo lay back, grows ya depths

At the beginning squads find it hard to establish
A working rhythm, my esoteric mysticism makes me a mathematician
Like Apollonius, phony as any who receive lobotomies
Get caught in my harsh canopy of unhappy rhapsodies
Fragments are stagnant, we work with ultramagnets
My reverberation crush men to micro fragments
I gets physical in the forest of absolute malnutrition
My complex disposition forces crews into submission
Beginnings on one six two, switches through to witch's brew
On which is true, or which is you
Isolation plus, a reflux, I see buck
Who get the equilibrium shattered or crushed to bits
I throw fits, and take trips to other dimensions
My henchmen will bend them and get attention
As I destroy decoys and make noise
My b-boys will be employed, to deploy like the falling of Troy
Fell into the soul, control what is concealed
If a void is not filled, my suicidal thoughts become real

My mathematical powers devour cowards as I spray words
Like acid rain showers, nations, you can't face them
Erase them or I praise them as my mind excites the wind
Like spiritual incantations, time will clash, haunt ya cipher
Whether concealed behind whirlwind fire or flood
Draw blood from wack souls as I smack hoes
With accessible decibels
The damage that my syntax causes is irreparable
The vanity of my insanity'll force ya whole clique to be divided
You have just bear witnessed to dub side united

Or do you love bugs, styles and fresh and numb sums of soul
Catch craft and the clutch is the archer's mode, and sure plot of device
We shot twice out of the same barrel
Rush through  slug
Advise me with words from deaf mute com battles
All time left, the pure shot plug the break
You marathon let me down to grace the plate
Full stagnant, touch  but revamp the squad
Gettin' loops,  on contact

The triflin' four fifths sparks another spliff
Bodies left stiff, you can't fuck with my ruggedness
My gunshots is leaving niggas on they asses
Smoking all the cannabis like the weed savage
With demented , you take an L
You no challenge, I blow up ya muthafuckin' brain cells
And leave you leaking, the slang tongue speaking
Cocks back the fifth, teflon starts to seek it
Criminals on a move, set a threat
Sip the Moët, and let off the twin TECs to ya muthafuckin' chest

""Rhyme be coming from an illadelph state of mind""
""Soul's from the streets of the Ill-a-delphiadaic insane""

I speak double-double, 'cause double trouble
Never do I rumble or mumble
My microphone sever clones
It's beyond  since the 46 chromosomes
No more, no less, no need to flex the ego trip with the clip
I got the 6-1-0 flow, and 082 is my zip
Yo, so call me out in Philly when you down to flip
No frill skills, or freestylin' when y'all wildin'
I'm broadcasting all the way live from Philly's Long Island

I visualize cream, TECs strapped with infrared beams
Stash keys, and , bickin' back, sipping Don P
My clique of criminals living comfortable
My pockets full of benjamins, fool surrendering
When I'm blendin' in, dub side invincible
Imperial, for lyrical tactics
I react with, son you get ya ass kicked
Indeed the face of evil is the face told by me
So I proceed to bleed my people, niggas say I'm too cerebral
Realize, dub side, flippin' perfection through your section
Sanity's slippin', whose the next victim to catch a blessin'

Set a threat, I rip the mic and run race like an auto shop
The silence left disperse leavin' heads in a casket box
This nappy headed villain, verbal torture is illegal
I back down clowns with a four pound as I defeat you
Inserting lyrical slugs that's straight deadly
A nickel plated verse I spit like a hollow tip, steady
Constantly cocking back rapid fire weapon
This adolescent keeps a clip full for street protection
Ain't nothing complex about the way I cock my biscuit
I set a threat and bust a TEC son, it's not explicit
Exquisite in divine rhymes I drop like jewels
The mic I abuse when I choose to break fools

With this course, I force many emcees out the galaxy
Challenge me, I rip apart flows with my analogy
Now that we got that established I crack ya cabbage with styles
You can't manage to damage or even fathom the mental capacity
'Cause I harass these wack emcees
In degrees I span universe
And mounting casaulties in the dark
I spark cells, dwelling in dungeons
My assumptions canonical, unstoppable, mad logical
I pull centrifugal, mystical
My poetics rip phonetics up in ritual syllable

Coming back from the city of Atlantic, it's the hispanic
Causing mass panic with fat static for ya addict
Automatic, I stick shift swift if you test me
Left the ciphers, layin' lifeless, leaving one spot empty
Bet you get ya crews bruised in black and blues
Put ya name and age on the front page of the newspaper
I drape the hood up on my carriage
Damage faggots with the habits
Feedin' on emcees like maggots
Inspect ya gadgets, my style switches 'cause I flipped it
Return the microphone, fix the stitches 'cause I ripped it

I can't stand like a maniac depressin'
That's been submerged in subterranean utopia
My dimension that I'm representin' is the Philipedia suburbs
Which has regenerated neoterics
That kick esoteric poetry on this plain of obscurity
One element, top lyricist
Interlocked with D-U-B squad of imperialist
With an innovator as the dictator
So we seek  rival crews with solipsistic views
Heads emulate but can't duplicate
'Cause this side can't be tugged, one love

Trial of Lies,UnKnown,UnKnown," ( Bobby Sherman - Land of Make Believe ) ]
In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doing fine
In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doing fine

Turn the television off, cousin. That ain't nothing for a girl to see
I got a niece and best believe she mean the world to me
She don't need to see the shit they think a girl should be
90 pound skinny bitches; that ain't even girl to me
Essentially that shit designed to take a hold of you
Telling lies, take your vision, take control of you
They're finding different ways to take your fucking soul from you
Show about a model make your self esteem low for you
Everything is fake, trust me; no one that lovely
I met a lot of famous people and they're fat and ugly
I ain't any better. I just think the fact is funny
That they'll take a little girl and pimp her for the cash and money
And what's gonna become of them in like 50 years
When Hannah Montana turning into Brittney Spears?
They chew you up and spit you out cause no one really cares
And ain't nobody gonna hold you when you really scared
Where the parents at? Cousin, this is really bad
Is this the motherfucking manager or really dad?
Is he concerned about his daughter or his silly pad?
This ain't gonna change nothing. I just think it's really sad

In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doing fine
In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doing fine

Turn the television off, cousin. It's a tool for them to clog the mind
Conservatism, liberalism, they divide the line
The natural feelings of a child is to be calm and kind
Then they show you ads for the Marines when they decide it's time
So they can send you to a war behind their father's crime
Then send you home in a limo but not provide a dime
And the news tell you, ""Cops is on the block for people""
I'm a put it simple and plain: cops is evil
Take the television show, Cops, for example:
That's the shit they want America to watch and sample
Never showing you how dirty that they really is
And that they hide behind their badge and that they're really bitch
I ain't never met a pig in my life
That I ain't wanna catch his body on the jig of my knife
That's another fucking topic for another day
I'm a tell you how they try to get you in another way
They tell you that there's something wrong with you; you need their drugs
But their ain't nothing fucking wrong with you. They're being thugs
They sell drugs in commercials at the same time
Lock a motherfucker up for the same crime

In the land of make believe you are all mine
In the land of make believe I'm doing fine
In the land of make believe you are all mine

I'm wicked as a Wiccan bitch when the candle wick's lit
Want to sample this shit? You need to read Sanskrit
And travel to the top of Mount Sinai to transmit
Running through the Red Seas like an escaped slave
Then holding up the walls of water with my sound waves
Like what I was doing during Public Execution, half-human half-mutant
Ap the seed of Rasputin
Gats shooting, shots ricocheting off of my steel body
And three quarter length fat goose to conceal shotties
The god walks the surface of the Sun it won't melt feet
Cause when's the last time you heard Ap rip a Celph beat?
Hard to the motherfucking core we are

I'm a five-star general, the motherfucking main man
Flip a bird, hold a swammy with the same hand
And do a rain dance when blood splatters and sprays
Cement mix in your IV turn your anatomy grey
Nobody ratted at A-O-T-P not trenched with OPP
I'm obsessed with OCD, a temperamental mental patient
With cyberkenetic onboard computer integration
One of rap's most innovative voices or flows
In front of missile-command buttons
I look around, all my choices just blow
So now you should know I'm the don of braggadocio
Flamethrower, I'm Cobra Kai and I'm keeping it dojo name goers
Come down and sign up, I'm training soldiers to rhyme rough and get they punchlines up

You's a small time hustler, I'm a bigger deal
And that shit you spit will be the shit that get you killed
Ready for war, I'm in it for the long haul
Throwing a molotov sidearm
Yeah, holding my fort with my pipes drawn
I kill everything when this mic's on, believe it

Yo f-u-c-k-f-b-I cops, you niggas don't like my shit
I tell them niggas suck a dirty dick with gonorrhea on the tip
I'm getting money courtesy of your bitch
Nigga it's the Army Of The Pharaohs, we hood American Idols
You don't like us? You can suck my dick
I got a long rope and an oxy if you feeling suicidal
See that window? Hop out that bitch

Nigga think you can ease it then be it but see me not
I'm too heated and weeded to lose it so please be hot
They just fiending to be the most conceited team on the top
I'm leaning to be the most meanest as Biggie and Pac
Man these demons is dreaming  for their spot
It's easy to see they just want to be me cause I'm hot
So fuck my theme and my plot, smoking weed in your 
And fall dummy to that casket cause they eat at you pop
You can believe it or not, I done sold weed to a cop
Caught a case, banged it and ran back to the fiends on my block
Fiends on my block? That's logical, my flow is phenomenal
I put a couple dots on your block like dominoes
Red beaming them, I stay with my team and them
I keep four nines in the tuck like Steve and them
This my track, a diss like that
Cause when you shoot like a freethrow you miss like Shaq

I'm from Killadel county, the killers they all surround me
I'm losing my nigga slowly Poppa Large make him proud of me
If you see Nemi then tell your people to see me
I'm here for the take and holding these streets down, believe me
My nigga Balo, I know your halo is platinum
I'm a see you at the gates, I'll be rocking something ravishing
The Seven Sacraments made for the sacrificial
The baptismal of rap bristle to sacramental
My rap essentials is murder tracks and pencils
Gat utensils is only used for niggas acting simple
My syllable slice niggas like a caesarean
You killable right? I spit bars like a barbarian

I never thought I'd see the day hip hop would give birth to faggots
Mr. T mohawks and Urkel glasses, I'm from a hood where they rob cool kids
And I can't wear skinny jeans cause my Glock's too big
Yeah, I got the wildest style, death bears a childish smile
Beat you with soap in a sock, you a Private Pyle
I'm fear order from green onions I peel quarters
What's rap? I bump Foghat and Creedence Clearwater
Bad moon rising, I'm howling at the bitch
Haters baffled how he spent a thousand on the kicks
I get thousands just to spit, fuck all the drama shit
I don't make statements, get bank statements and deposit slips
And it's always gonna be this way
C-notes like study hall in tenth grade
To this day I fuck bitches and get paid
What's piff? I got the green monster like Fenway",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-cookin-keys-lyrics
Those with no eyes (interlude),A History of Violence,2008.0,"I, I who have nothing...
Verse I: Ikon
Intersections in real time
The unbroken circle and dimensions of the mind
The tie that binds
The eternal tie that defines
The vanity of my insanity in due time
Will shine
Like the night seas under the moon
The haunted corners of familiar rooms
Yet i'm consumed
With vanishing into thin air
The realization that this shit is my cross to bear
So where
Did I think I could run away to see
The people that decided to leave without asking me
But we
Decide to wait for happier tomorrows
And find someone so they can be distractions from our sorrow
But my distraction's the books and paper that I scrawl in
I'm eloquent as summer breeze and leaves that have just fallen
I've crawled in a corner hoping all of this will end
With the knowledge that love is just another word for revenge
I who have nothing but the comfort of my sins
I who have nothing but the comfort of my friends
Chorus:
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
I, I who have nothing
I, I who have no one
Verse II: Ikon
As I decay, demons prey above me like a vulture
Ability to endure contradiction is a high sign of culture
Verbal sculptures, self defacing
It is not God or lunacy that I am facing
But the erasing of the purity and passion of my words
The herds of cattle babble on with talk of the absurd
But I preferred
To walk away from all the feuds
To find my life is more confusing than a rubics cube
So I'm subdued
In all my words of verbal prods
To live alone one must be an animal or a God
But it's official
All of my pain is clear as crystal
The natural side of life has now been seeming artificial
But I can hit you
And rest assured that I'ma last words
I could give a fuck about ya secrets and ya passwords
I get past words and their ability to hurt you
Patience is a virtue and knowledge is a commercial
I who have nothing but the pain that I've referred to
I who have nothing but the pain that I've referred to
Chorus
Verse III: Ikon
Lost among the miracles, I stand alone
And have grown into a being that's sitting on top a throne
I've known
For many years that I would turn to rust
I find a reason for another breath
Before my return to dust
I become one with science and mathematics and the rising of the sun
I'm numb
To all of those who blind and cannot see
The chastiser of the enemy
Perception requires duality
Inspect your soul, the color of coal inside the body
I have hardly, come across them who's holy
Send them to the chairmen to control thee
Burning of the sun and frigidness of the cold
The battlefield is new but the war is now old
You can never see the merest shadow of a halo
Above the head of evil djin who's deadly like tornado
The world has become an aquarium
Full of gaping fish with murderous smiles
I on the other hand stand on the outside looking in
Writing down murderous vows
I who have nothing but the lack of variation
And I who have nothing but chains and suffocation

Ripped To Shreds,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I?m coming to your classroom strapped like Kindergarten Cop (I)End the starters (I) am the hardest artist to rock (I)
Roll over your whip and turn your strip into a horror scene
When the hammer bust we start a war we carnivores that need to eat
Ain?t running from shit bitch we ain?t scared, you ain?t gonna disrespect a vet
With a chopper that (got shell catchers) won?t be no ballistic check
I get the check, I get the dough, goddamnit I be the shit fo sho?
Celph Titled in the motherfuckin spot, motherfuckers get shot mother fuckers will hit the floor
When my above the margin thugs are barging in
Your whole parliament turn butter soft like tubs of margarine
Awesome arson with a large carbon cartridge sparking often involved in carving apart kids in they apartment/ And
You can?t see me from this angle/ True
But the torch on my arm will show you what a four alarm blaze will do
The Cuban Caucasian dude lacerations from Sabretooth
My bitches hold guns like Sarah Palin in a bathing suit

Light a candle in the snow, fuck a Christmas carol
You can kill a Cambodian can?t kill a pharaoh
Kill a African Spanish nigga your fucking niece
Kill the president, terrorist, kill a fucking priest
Your momma, your father, your sister, and your right hand
Kill a hustler, customer, kill a white man
See the moral of the story is you can spare ammo and anybody kill yourself but no a fucking pharaoh

I believe you not in the league
And obviously you blind to see you not in the league
You might wanna be on wine back you high on the E
I move like Mohammed Ali
Test me, you won?t want to be my
Food for thought, who would?ve thought?
That I woulda been something you woulda bought
Cause you would?ve thought I would?ve been
Too perked up to prove it again
Too perked up to lose it again
When you press got me moving my pen
And I ain?t rolling around, shot in his head and a hole in the ground
I ain?t gotta wait, my moment is now
I gotta hate I?mma flow out of town
I ain?t gotta fake like I?m holding the pound
I ain?t got eight, I got four in the round
Get shot when the hot trey Glock is cocked and it popped and it sure enough fold you clowns (?)
Call the coroner now
I ain?t trying to stop till I?m ninety and sick
Die like Bonnie and Clyde in the whip
Flows so sick it reminds you of shit
Don?t know shit when the coppers around
I ain?t never Jay copping the pound
I ain?t ever seen vinnie ridin around in a Crown Victoria at the scene of a homicide
With a look on his face like fuck you now
Fuck him, fuck her, you can hate me now
You keep on going till it break me down
I?mma keep on spitting till they take me down

Light a candle in the snow, fuck a Christmas carol
You can kill a Cambodian can?t kill a pharaoh

Kill the president, terrorist, kill a fucking priest
Your momma, your father, your sister, and your right hand
Kill a hustler, customer, kill a white man
See the moral of this story is you can spare ammo and anybody kill yourself but no a fucking pharaoh

I?m hesitant to meet people, I have a tendency to eat people
My team feeds you the priest on the discreet steeple
I don?t listen to anything you perceive legal
Turn a Christian to anything you would deem evil
Left with holes is how the sub machine leave you
Small and precise, like you was poked with clean needles
I don?t drag my brother into it cause he?s peaceful
But Vinnie takes a lot of shots like Japanese people
In fact I take a lot of shots like Kobe does
I don?t smoke the rock anymore but the homie does
Stoupe the first mother fucker to show me drugs
And how to keep the motherfuckers safe in the Folgers mug
You a bitch, you don?t do what a soldier does
If I was you I?d move into the left like Miss Hova does
Peace to everybody living that shows me love
And anybody hating on the god you can hold your slug

Light a candle in the snow, fuck a Christmas carol
You can kill a Cambodian can?t kill a pharaoh
Kill a African Spanish nigga your fucking niece
Kill the president, terrorist, kill a fucking priest

Saviorself (dirty),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, I built with Alexander the Great
He told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time, yet time fear the pyramids
He gave me more jewels, he told me that
Amenhotep was immortal, I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest, and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and what I will brings
And your whole team Judas, my road thin, gold skin like Zeus's
I speak the dialog of the dead, I practiced the same war tactics
In King Arthur's head, so let the swordsmen kill the beast

Red ink from saint blood, nigga, you ain't thug
Stare into the face of a king's mug
Crush grape, feel the wine jug, ill thoughts
Build from the mind of rhyme, rolls off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this, for the clueless
I'm Shakespeare'ing, with grey earrings
Speak like Tiberius, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharoah
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now im known as the Dead Street Apostle
See dem feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread, til they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates, where you can't breathe
Stay high off that dead weed, in the mind is where I plant seeds
To grow fruit, of kings so brute, of army troops
Mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite vision, stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take, more than one scoop, it's Priesthood

I studied element 1-15, with the Elohim
Saw the Canaanites, Sumerians, and the Philistines

In life on Mars, that mean the beast got you
You don't wanna see me and Killah Priest hostile
You don't wanna see, desert eag' heat pop you
This is Mothman Prophecy, walk back
To the sand of Iraq, and let the prophet breath
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk on water with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shot the beast with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep to be a strong Pharoah
It's a war when the Gods spit
It's Allah, when I split the icebergs, in the Arctic

Inifinite...no you don't fuck around with the inifinite
There's no way you do that...
A painted hill has two sides, the kind you can touch with your hand
The kind you can feel in your heart
Your soul, the spiritual side;
And you know, the worst of the two...is the spiritual

I'm leaf-twistin, but still kill your whole belief system
I speak wisdom, translated to street diction
A past victim of the government for grapple
Now I slash you, I'm the slave wit snapped shackles
After cash rules, a-alikes move wit me
We murdered the fakes involved in the three-sixty
Eighty-five face the truth, you're too dumb
You burn and failed attempts reachin the sun
I grab you and squeeze until your pores bleed
Manipulate the earth that you formerly believed
Even after you're buried underneath the soil
Send a message to hell, nobody grieve for you
Your physical mass is converted into ash
Allah's wrath is engraphed on your epitab
Spend eternity wit the underground forces
Your screams echo in deaf ears of the remorseless
 2x
You don't even wanna test
Uh-uh-oh, you wanna kill more, God bless

The raw mangler, seven angles of Angular
Strangle the pagans who stayed in the pages of Diameter
Rhyme shatterer, with nine rhymes I'm hackin you
The author will scorch ya wit the torches of Joseph Mangler
Sended you to the squared circle to meet me
To beat me won't be easy, you'll face thesis of Meche
Blood'll apease me, raps are prehistorical
Cerebral of cathedral that leads you into the oracle
I'm horrible, I burn wit no time to react
Rewind DAT's so fine I pull spines out the back
In time I crack minds that's what the brain desire
Messiah pulls as Mariah into the rain of fire
Barb wire around pagans that read the Bible
Genocidal and liable to just cleave your spinal
Final hours, the forbidden fruit they fond as Iris
Study rappers, bringin wackness like Abolo scholars
First in line to try to battle me, I left him limbless
Tragic rappers just a fallacy, I left em skinless
Beginners, keep your distance because we might be vicious
You can find me wit Louis Logic drinkin pints of Guiness
You don't even wanna test
Uh-uh-oh, you wanna kill more, God bless

Aiyyo when I rhyme
Fortunatley I possess a Jedi Mind
So the force is with me (When I rhyme)
Son it makes me spit a fresh one
So when Treds is done, even a athiest will say I blessed him
And when my jam bang, better cop that
Fuck all these players who can't hang, get a jockstrap
Cuz we drop bombs, better be scared
Cuz it's either hop on or be prepared for us to lock horns
We engage, when the pen sprays we wage war
And then you know what they say, when it rains it pours
So face us, cuz you can't change the laws of nature
We independent, it's competition callin us major
We major threats who deliver, so place your bets
We'll bring it minus the Moet, Rollies, and Avirex
We just spit shit too amazing, just shit
That when you face it you'll see it's a must-win situation
Ain't no second chance (anyway), not next to the champs
Because it's our freestyle that's gettin grants from the NEA
We well in doubt versus these rappers we tell about
(Cuz us and them) Difference between takin a L and a bow

I dash from my ship in the Roswell Crash
You smash when you dash with the clashing ox
Saw you in half without a fucking magical box
Wet pussy always seems to splash my cock
I'm dead, they just didn't leave the casket locked
Pass my block I let shots drill in your spleen
We're ill marines with hand held killing machines
Steal dreams with the armored steel guard your grill

Following Allah's will, horror in the skill
Caught up in the real, don't give me cause to kill
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness goes
If I had to follow the moon across the globe
With the staff and white robe, I still hold metal
Disciples who walk on glass and rose petals

We smash mics and blast too precise
Fast 40 days and pray for 40 nights
Yo, yo, I'm savage, I write rhymes in pitch blackness
Any motherfucker that front, is left backless
Y'all motherfuckers just burn into ashes
Trying to step into the zone where Vinnie Paz is
It's Black Sabbath, put a slug in his grill
'Cause Jedi Mind two five thuggin' for real
You ever think there might be trouble then peel
'Cause a motherfucker like me dumpin' to kill

On my way to Philly to fight for Mumia
Only thug guerrillas will react to this

Half of y'all is performers and actresses
I keep at least a 100 grand in the mattresses
Shit so hot, soon as I write it I get indicted
I dare one y'all scared niggas to bite it
I stood in hood lobbies getting my rocks off
With long johns and 3 pairs of socks on
Ducking from the pigs so I don't get knocked off
Or popped off and y'all thugs are soft
It's like you're skirt get pulled up, clothes come off
Red Dragons, can't even fuck with my brain patterns
I'm all live, Pentium Plus and Benz wagons
Mahdi, believe me it do ring bells
If you saw me do dirt you won't live to tell
I've done lived in a cell, did bids in hell

Kill your vitals with verses, curse
And hearses move em like Vinny Idol
Take Vinny and Planet, mould them inside a bowling ball
Launch em against the way you claim you carry, break your shoulders off

Throw the dresser away with the evidence, burn a fucking wig

Bullets are free throw, silencer is the proof guard
Said you was a crook but you ain't busting no lead homes
Only jack you pulling is connected to some headphones

Stretch your neck till your head meets your ass
I'll beat your dad dead now he's a deadbeat dad

Nothing is ever promised, especially your life I demolish
Too many niggas claim street but wouldn't last in the projects
Too many happy-go-lucky cats rap with no money
Black why you gotta act? I be screaming where the money at?
I never understood your hood mentality
Man you still selling weed on the block dog, that's blasphemy
That's embarrassing, you nickel and diming
A small cut off a bundle and you thinking you shining
I could rumble in the jungle and tussle with all the lions
My hustle could turn to rustle but for now I'm surviving
Living, my kids are chilling and I'm whipping the Newboy
It ain't a Maybach but it's better than your toy


I'm a motherfucking warlock, get your jaw popped by the raw rock
Use your tongue as a doorstop, with your face I floor mop
Get your pores popped like a dermatologist
I'm wilding with thugs who go in your mouth like Polydent
I body shit, I ruin you homes
Turn your studio session into a funeral home
Two in your dome, got young bucks who buck for us
Homie follow the laws of God and Chuck Norris
AOTP, we in good company
Screaming we the fucking world champs like Chase Utley
My whole fam-o, tuck and engadge, busting AKs

I've been catching fucking bodies for twenty years
From eating motherfuckers on the street up to bloody tears
Camouflage backpacks, Timbs and some money wares
Now these rap faggots fucking sweeter than Gummy Bears
This isn't simple arithmetic, this is ancient math
Make you lose your faith in Jehovah like you was Damon Dash
I take a fucking machete and cut your brain in half
You're fucking with something deadly and Vinnie Satan laughs
I'm the greatest rapper alive, but Vin biased
Cause I ain't get my chance to shine, call me Len Bias
I'll be patiently waiting for you if then try us
I don't call it writing no more, I call it a pen virus

You faggot mixtape rappers I should snap your throat
Bunch of tracks cracking jokes about crack and coke
Release the Kraken, Ap is the cracker's last hope
Honkey Kong fucking bitches leaving mattresses broke
If the condom break I'mma tell the bitch to abort
I'm like the sniper on the roof looking out for the stork
Little dorks getting shanked for a box of Newports
There ain't a jail that could hold me cause Ap teleports

Its like there's something wrong with my brain, mommy
You was always there for me so i love you
I'd die for you and I place no one above you
Tell Lenny and the kids they should stay strong
And when I meet my maker that I'm gonna pray for them
And tell P that ill think he'll be a great father
Tell Young that I think he'll be a great author
Tell Planet that his wife and kids gorgeous
And the same goes for Andy and for Marcus
And tell (King) Syze that I have faith in him
And never let the industry snakes get him
(Movie Quote: The Addiction)
The Entire world's a graveyard (the ending of time)
That's all we are. We're the ones (the ending of time)
Who let the dying know (the ending of time)
The hour has come. (the ending of time)

I got a few things more I should say, mommy
I never meant to hurt you in any way, mommy
I never meant to hurt anyone, its gods work
Cuz waking up everyday for me is hard work
And tell June that she was the love of my life
And that I never stopped loving her even in spite
All the things that we went thru together
Thru the highs and lows and bad weather

Let Frank know he always made me smile
Tell him back in the days was crazy wild
Tell Stoupe that i always had his back mom
And we was meant to be together on the track mom

Tell Chique I consider him a brother
When I die the pain will spit into another
That's just how life goes mom, this is painful
I'll come back to you in dreams as an angel
So don't blame yourself for what happened
Cuz you were the best mother that I could fathom
So I'm going into the first place that I can go
I love you, sincerely Vinchenzo...
(Movie Quote: The Addiction)
The Entire world's a graveyard
That's all we are. We're the ones who let the dying know
The hour has come
(fading out with chorus)
Mommy just tell everyone I love them
Know what I'm saying?
Tell my man, MaGruff keep holding me down
Know what i mean?
Tell them to stay strong
Tell Des Devious to keep doing his thing mommy
Tell Locke to keep his head up things gonna get better
Know what I'm saying?
Everything's going to be good for everybody
Its just hard
Its just hard for me
I know this may seem like its the easy way out
But its not
The pain hurt
Tell everyone I love them and I always had their back

I ain't trying to be crucified by the system
You should take heed, I advise you to listen
Watch me break knees, I'm surprising my victims
The question remains who am I when I'm spitting?
It's me the MC, I ain't no new edition
My mind's a coliseum, I spit diamonds that glisten
The beat is my journal where these lines will get written
Been through the garden, ate the fruit that's forbidden
So back the f**k up when I'm removing my fitted

Y'all can all die in the spot that you sit in

Why you fronting like you're rugged and gritty?
Why I spit it so hot? Why I like Big L and Big Pun more than Biggie and Pac?
I'm from that late 90's era where that Polo wasn't jig enough
But Gucci and Louis and Prada shit wasn't big enough
I would spit it ridiculous, stay on point like Rondo
Y'all bring up the rear like a J-Lo convo
No, they don't want no beef, they all want their teeth
I may go bronco so lay low pronto, chief
Four albums in a year, that's more than in your whole career
They all bang, battle out, do more than end your whole career

God is the 777,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The murder hadn't occurred to me, burgundy wasn't burgundy
Purposely earth to me like a virgin had given birth to me
It's irking me that you would consider uttering words to me
Nervously urging me to keep killing and killing perfectly
Certainly third degree burns followed by having surgery
When he deferred to me, he was poisoned by drinking mercury
Hurdling over things that are currently in my periphery
It's all a blur to me, I was never sensing the urgency
Never sensing emergency, never sensing the thrill
Never sensing the certainty, never searching the kill
Was never searching, everything was done in the name of wicked
The brother's name was indifferent, the hunger pain wasn't lifted
That was Satan, black wings and a man made pedestal
The only fucking rapper could see me is my identical
Another story, another chapter, another parable
I missed making music with Stoupe, cause he incredible
""God is the 777""

Vocally none of y'all are approaching me or come close to me
Hopefully you're aware that you only holding my groceries
Openly holding the only opening in the hope to me
Provoking me is only gonna result in a choking spree
Supposedly I was sent by holiness, it's unknown to me
Loaning me Book of Law without Aleister Crowley owning me
Globally doing things that you only could dream of locally
I son you motherfuckers like you was peddling dope for me
The guns is always with me so I would never feel lonely
Combine it with the fact that I'm irresponsible socially
Supposed to be the art of the mechanism of action
Embezzlement of the fraction, the pessimism of passion
It had to be the psyche and the cunning of the Assassin
The tongue will give you a lashing like Punisher when he's rapping

You don't want no blood or no beef like you was Vegan Reich
Put you in a grave and put a hole in your heart
Destroy everything you know and you thought
Destroy everything in Babylon, you making fake rap
I hate that because you babble on
All you kids are pawns, I'm a hate monger

Heavily breathing, shook in the Garden of Eden

Souls from the streets (1994),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Jedi Mind Tricks – Souls From The Streets (1994) Lyrics

My mathematical powers devour cowards as I spra words
Like acid rain showers, nations, you can’t face them
Erase them or I praise them, as my mind excites the wind
Like spirits of ill concensions, time will clash
On ya cipher, lyric concealed behind whirlwind fire
Or flood, draw blood from wack souls as I smack hoes
Live concensive, or yes ’em, it’s damage
That my sintex causes, is irrepreble
Cuz vanity of my insanity force ya whole click to be divided
You have just bear witnessed to dub side united

Who do you love? Bugs, styles and fresh
And numb somes of soul, witchcraft
The clutch is the archer’s mode, and sure plot
Of device, we shot twice, after the same arrow
Rush through life, it’s off this slug
Advise me with words from death, and new com battles
Far time left, and pure shot plug that way
You marathron, let me down to grace the plate
Full stagnant, touch I, but revamp the squad
Gettin’ loops, saviate on contact

The triflyn four fists, sparks another spliff
Bodies left stiff, you can’t fuck with my ruggedness
My gunshots is leaving niggas on they asses
Smoking all the canibus, like the weed savage
Rip dimensions and it matters, take an L
You no challenge, I blow up, ya muthafuckin’ brain cells
And leave you legal, the slang tongue spigel
Cocks back the fifth, teflon starts to seek it
Criminals on a move, set a threat
Sip the moet, and let off the twin techs to ya
Muthafuckin’ chest

I speak double-double, cause double trouble never do I rumble
On a rule, my microphone sever clones
It’s beyond binocalurs, sence the moody, six chromosomes
I’m no more less, no need to flex the evil, trip with the clip
I got the 6-1-0 flow, and 0 and 2 is my zip
Yo, so call me out in Philly when you down to flip
No frill skills, or freestylin’ when y’all wildin’
I broke cats all the way live, on Velly’s Long Island
I visualize cream, tech’s scrap with infered beams
Stash keys, and tease, lickin’ back so y’all can
My click of criminals, flippin’ confortable
My pockets full of benjamins, fool surrending
When I’m blendin’ in, dub side invincible
Imperial, for lyrical tactics
I react with signs to get ya ass kicked
Indeed the face of evil, is the face told by me
So I proceed to bleed my people, niggas say I’m too cerebral
Lies, dub side, flippin’ perfection through your section
Sanity’s slippin’, whose the next victim to catch a bless

Set a threat, I rip the mic and run race like an auto practice
I inflect this verse leavin’ heads in they casket
Watch this nappy headed villain, brutal torture is illegal
I back down clowns with a four pound, as I defeat you
Insert the lyrical slugs, that straight’s very
A nickel plated verse I spit like a hollow tip steady
Constantly, drop ya wack back with fire weapon
This adolescent, keeps a clip full for street protection
Ain’t nothing complex about the way I cock my biscuit
I set and threat it, bust that tech son, it’s not explicit
Exquisite, in divine rhymes I drop like jewels
The mic I abuse when I choose to break fool

With this course, I force many emcees out the galaxy
Challenge me, I rip apart flows with analogy
Now with me, got that establish and wrap ya cabbage with styles
You can’t manage to damage or even fathom the mental capacity
Cuz I harass these wack emcee’s, in degrees
I splatter universe, and mountain casaulties
In the dark, my squad sells, blowin’ ya conscience
My assumptions, ethotical, unstoppable, anthological
I pull the trigger with mystical, my poetic
Rip fanatics up, and rich with the sinical

Coming back from the city of Atlantic, it’s the hispanic
Causing mad panic, with fat static for ya addict
Automatic, I stick shift quick if you test me
Left the ciphers, layin’ lifers, seen in one spot and attended
That you get ya crews bruised in black and blues
Put ya name and age on the front page, of the newspaper
I drape my hood up on my carriage, damage faggots
Quit the habits, feedin’ on emcee’s on maggots
Inspect ya gadgets, my style switches cause I flick it
Return the mic, fixin’ stitches, cause I ripped it

I can’t stand like a maniac depressin’
That’s been submerged in subterrarian eutopia
Why’s the mansion that I’m representin’
Is the feel competitin’ in suburbs
Which has regenerated the etaric
That kicks the subterric poetry on this plain of obscurity
One element, top lyricist
Intellectin’ with, d-u-b squad of imperialist
With an innevator as the dictator
So we can see you, liver clues with side and system views
Heads emulate but can’t duplicate, cause this side
Can’t be tugged, yo, one love",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-souls-from-the-streets-1994-lyrics

Crop Circle Communion,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Feat. Lost children of Babylon

I am he who walks beyond the cycle of Tan
A guinea systematic survey
On the heavens long before the spells of Kimet
I had advanced cosmos journey apologist
Substantiate statements
I commands the aspects of creation
Astronomers can't even interpret my ancient civilisation
Of Andromeda
The Dragon of Dracos come touch the inner sun
I went forth, a life force out of the core of Epsu
Bring forth the possibilities of solar energy into infinity
Like a Nimbo; endless, trapped it, Kingu;
A myth too ignorant Like the Sumerians
Explorer of the solar system like Galileo
Bring the mist of Mahabharata
Celestial God symbolic to the disagreeable complex mathematics
Of the Hebrew bible
Receive and transmit the letters of the Rasqiniaans
Who have seen the 3rd suns
I am like Milton Milankovich
Who outline the theory of ground philosophies
Messiah of all biblical tablets
Watch how the process of creation
Links with the measurements of Tan
Scientifical like a geologist
I bring the geological changes to the world
Like the prophecies of the Book of Revelations

The compartment allies
Now my device shatters the fusel anomas
And for my dialectical, destroyed innocuous sinconquent
Travel beyond 5 dimensions
A cipher cytoplasm or phantasm
An Orc’s sight;
Antithetical to atoms
I leave you vacuous like an Organtoron, pulses
Facilitate my brain waves, determining what planet I’m on
CyberTron transmit my Mhakabaraso over the sea of influence
Never neglect My lobular units
Stereo-material movements
Painfully Cranials statisticals giving your Cerebral Cortex
Damaging Demigods
Crushing egos, into which a wench began by
Extracting a Trans-cordial
Connections of Macros-manic animals
Caves of sleek stature, once sabbatical
Once bring drama
I’m bright on harrowing lava
Within the Plexus from my anatomical
It gets darker
A sense of urgency
Enters the atmosphere with my excursion
In this Microcosm, a third version!
Specifically a generation
Of Mutated
Warriors from the Nether;
That’s ‘Neva Antiquated’
My flux is like somatic stimulation
As macro-electrolytes converge
Eternal recurrence
My mentals merge; its cyclical
But it revamps its own thesis, Reaching
The premium blend in the communion

Follow me beyond the cloud
In the stratosphere, to the House of El Huul
It should lead you to a place opposite my heavenly throne
In the temple of ancient Kimet
Who discovered the wonders and the 24 elders
These beings, the Rasqiniaans
Come to enlighten you
With supreme Mathematics
Dramatically stood
12 disagreeable
12 agreeable
7 feet tall in diameter
These elders sit
On the flight in the craft Niburu
Passing through the universe density levels
Heading straight for the wrath of Andromeda
Elliptical physical galaxy
Containing beings in the line of Dracos
Stomping on negative snakes like Broncos
Create magnetic field around my aura
Incapacitating ships
Negative energy creates the spiritual slaughter
Where you dwell in the physical world is horror!
My mind returns to El Yeum
To inform the elders of the incident
In case of the need for assistance
To return to my epic form
From my physical;
And see my soul arise into a sham
Hitting the arcs of Cumulus clouds of Annun
I left my image of a crop circle in the form of a galactical star map
Perhaps to another plane of consciousness

Through a series of psychological tests
I have been declared a demon
Traveling through dimensions fatal weapons leave you bleeding
Dissecting gray matter, doesn't matter in my cathedral
But how could you stand my timberlands in your cerebral
Faces of space probes be scattered through my mental
Acoustics in my chamber just endanger instrumental
Fundamental rhythms are symbols of paternal power
Get devoured, by my infinite skills to disappear
Getting lost in the holocaust that rage between my ears
Complex like gravity
Tragically and mathematically
I defeat ya squadron black magically
Analyze the tangle
As you get mangled by my triangular rhythms...
Systematic rotations of my words cause cataclysms

In the farthest universal
At your communion Neffum council
Beings come to some planets in your galaxy
That were most frequently visited
Because life existed there
In various forms and deities it was
Why they explore mars
Gives meanings
Ahnk is Jah, foremost to the firm-land
Super friends of man
Fore-prophesise sight
Tight with a photon of light
Rubber band…
Others in Orion, skies or heaven
Star sections, constellation
Ploughing towards us
Lending aid to help our Taurus
Routine, orbit on the slate, clean
Took a thousand
One fall sure four
Equinox a birth time deemed;
The team of thirteen
Searching our rich natural resources
And minerals
To take back after retrieving
Our responsibilities are fulfilled!

He told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time, yet time fear the pyramids
He gave me more jewels, he told me that
Amenhotep was immortal, I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest, and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and what I will brings
And your whole team Judas, my road thin, gold skin like Zeus's

In King Arthur's head, so let the swordsmen kill the beast

It's Allah, when I split the icebergs, in the Arctic
I don't care what the cause is
And I'mma ride for my fam, no matter what the cost is

Yeah, Vinnie Paz, Killah Priest, yea
Priesthood, Maccabeez, yeah, Army of Pharoah
Aight? Yeah",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-saviorself-clean-lyrics
Trinity (Instr.),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I metamorph phrases to glaciers
Have em come together in liquid stages
Then turn down the temperature and have em frozen into a solid foundation
Now added to that this well produced amazement
The crash is enough, to have the world tipped off it's axis a notch
It'll take the likes of, Jedi Minds to construct new longtitude lines
In order to get around but now, you're askin for too much
With minds put together
I'm like an alternative source of energy like, electricity generators
Separators of the wack rap, to the world reknownst individuals
Played in deuce parts life's nara-rators
Rhyme gladiators, is what we're referred as
Food for thoughts tooken offa ya plate instead ya serve trash
Ikon and Logic serve as my accomplices
And bring our own form of trinity to show y'all onto this
Rhyme patterns come across as astonishing
So I have all right to feel myself to the point of genetalia fondlin'

We the three emcees that rock that shit
Pick the twelve inch up and knock that shit
""Louis Logic, L-L-Fudge, Ikon the verbal hologram""

I spread around me a viral infectious faculties
Applied chiropractically so rappers cannot come back to me
Simply outta respect, or suffer the consequence
The effect of which is that of absent father neglect
Wreakin' havoc, on egos speakin' magic
Castin' the curse on fashion emcees for region fabric
Send 'em wandering through the labyrinth
As far as cuttin' careers short on mics
I'm what the NYPD is to entrapment
Epitome of have been, yet schooled
Engineers peep the structure of my mind
Now they wonder how the math went
L was made to ascend, which is evident by my descent
Spreadin east to west like European settlements
Sequence, but even, I'm captured
Self destructive explosive devices reactin' from my mind is everlastin'
Which makes me a Trojan horse of sorts
Drainin' ya plasma until ya rhythm section hold the contorts
While snatchin' a arm in this sport
Drove off on ya squarely, then the Warren report
And the single bullet theory
Hook (x2)

You f**k wid me you won't survive
Ikon been live since eighty five
Mine'll still have a carat thats tragical crystallized
Hit them guys, in they eyes wid f**kin shrapnel
Bomb they castle, set fire into they chapel
Wrap a lasso round rappers who wanna battle
Hologram wid two bad hands force you to grapple
Elo-rapsol, reverse time and bring diseases
Christians will worship Allah and Muslims will worship Jesus
Kill all ya leaders, wid my savage lyrical thesis
Rip out my f**kin' heart and eat it before I'm defeated
The one who's seated, on the throne within in a forcefield
You'll get tossed and feel lost like Holden Caulfield
Raw deal, rappers decipher that schism
Followed Solomon and brought him in at ya baptism",https://genius.com/Jedi-mind-tricks-trinity-instr-lyrics

Retaliation (clean),UnKnown,UnKnown,"The metal inside the barrel passes
Through the frames in your glasses
Quick passage, leave your dome piece backless
Envision blackness, leave you hatless, fucking capless
Watchin niggas dig the spot where the earth's crack is
Hard to graph like science and math is
The cavemen who don't practice and live backwards
We oxen with streets is watchin
Release shotguns, niggas got Dietz and Watson
Feel no love, no way you shield the slugs
The ill thugs, we box with steel gloves
Doubt my faith, you can taste the slug case
Leaving niggas looking like dogs with the pug face
Even your girl can catch the capsule
I love pussy but never the bitch that it's attached to

Why you wanna battle wit kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink puerto-rock rum
85 (the 85%): face the truth, you're too dumb
If retaliation comes yo then fuck it it just comes
Why you wanna battle wit kids with steel tongues?
Who rip up mics and drink puerto-rock rum
85 (the 85%): face the truth, you're too dumb
If retaliation comes yo then fuck it it just comes

We itchin' to kill, that's why we spittin' the real
Stick to the drill and maybe we'll be grippin a mill'
The clip'll expel, dump 'em in a ditch or a hill
'Cause the mother fucker ain't left me shit in his will
And y'all was always sounding like a bitch when you spill
And we the rawest mother fucking clique in the field
So real mother fuckers better recognise real
Or ill muther fuckers gonna exercise skill
Y'all better chill when the Hologram build
Little mother fucker got hands just like steel
Whoever approach me and what i feel
""while u find ya legs bein' replaced by steel""
So y'all better yield or imma choke faggots
My hands held more razorblades than coke addicts
We like to quote facists 'cause we the meanest
And rip off your fingers with the pliers of Chaka Demus
