Hop up on top and start jicky-jicky-jerking
Slow down for me, a-you moving too fast
My fingers keep slipping, I'm tryna grip that ass
Keep being hard-headed and I'ma make you get on me
Got human enough disguise but my face is a doggy

If you going through your cycle, I ain't with it, I'm gone
You must have heard about them hoes that I beat up in my home
They wasn't telling the truth baby, you know they was wrong
Now, make it official, wind up some of that dome
I don't mind buying blue, your riding to
Don't be asking nigga questions about where I'm driving you
Lil mama my shit together, I ain't jiving you
I don't think that nigga could do you better then I could do, ya know
And Juvenile from cross the street by the derby
Same nigga that used to be running with Rusty and Kirby
Can a playa from the 'Nolia get a chance with it?
But I can't bounce with you without using my hands with it

With brush burns and swollen
I'm toting, she wanted me to make her out a believer
I gurantee ya I'ma see ya when I see ya
And just don't holla out my name like we was all that
Your pussy throw back and you know that
So stop stunting, slow motion for a real nigga
I'm going off that incredible potion and I'ma deal with ya

I like how that Victoria Secret sit in that ass
Let me pour some more hip and Hennsey in your glass
Would I be violating if I grab me a handful?
I know what's happening, all I want is a sample
Who you with? I'm in the rental today
It's going down and happening and I remember the way
Less money we spend on bullshit, the more for the weed

Ya see me I eat sleep shit and talk rap
Ya seen that 98 Mercedes on TV, I bought that
I had some felony charges I fought that
Been sent to no return but still was brought back
Nigga threw some slangs at me whodie I caught that
I punished them lil bitches before they can car jack
Now I'm lookin for they family and pile up the war bat
If I ain't a hot boy then what do you call that
Nigga disrespect me I'mma be in all black
Companied by some niggas bout killin' and all that
Me Cory and Mercy gettin' ducked off

In the jeep ridin' four deep
I booted up at these nigga claimin' they know me

You don't want to fuck wit me

Bitch what I'll bust yo ass up
Don't even go there 
whodie

For the right price I'll bust the right brain
Why must a nigga try I can't do the right thing
Only God knows what the future might bring
Nigga might be shive, nigga might be triflin'
Nigga might survive if he bout that rifling
Whats up that'll stop a nigga from playin'
Something like a chopper or a grenade in his hand
Boy look nigga don't play no games no mo
Nigga'll bust ya head if you bang his ho
Attitude adjustments we all need
Don't call the law enforcements nigga call me

Man let me get this beef shit over bruh
Ain't no bit this year I'm from the 'Nolia bruh
Whats yo beef plan cuz it was told to us
How I'ma be runnin' with these killas and backin' down
How I'ma look in front of my people, like a clown
Tha G code what we live by and we die by
The book is what we will never abide by
Niggas drive by, gettin' loose
Beefing with each other like the Checker Board and Goose
Come in Compton or the Watts nigga
Up in New York ya keep' 'em open watch nigga
Foe ya played by a hit or retalion

Them brown bags, I sold that; them street corners, I know that
Appetite, I'm so hungry; 
Democrat, I go donkey
Weed head, I'm junky; White boy, I smoke honkeys
Niggas like what Juvie on, he's wilding out, he's straight tripping
Y'all niggas is straight pussy and ya'll are about to be rape victims
Boy I'm fucking with truckloads, started off from an 8 ball
Like airplanes on a runway, a real nigga gonna take off
I'm the reason my street hot, still stick to my G-code
Tees, Bo's and my Reeboks, and I'm cheesed up; I've got Cheetos
I told ya'll I'll quit beefing; I'm chilling dawg, I'm on rehab
My lawyer told me my record clean and if y'all fuck with me, I might relapse
Like Noriega got a lot of guns, like Las Vegas I'm pimping
Laws keeping their distance, ain't no penetrating my system
Bad Boy, not Puffy
 Hot Boy, get stuffy
My main bitch got a black card and she'll spend it all cause she love me

Bitch I'm picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
I'm spooning with your bitch and make you do the dirty dishes
Man I hate the thirsty bitches, cut em off like circumcision
I'm the type to talk shit and it'd be words of wisdom

Monster, killer, real nigga hustla on the reala
My nigga, a dope dealer dealer
Hustler, shining, 
a Big Tymer nigga
So high on my grind I'll be high flying nigga
With my strapped up, my guns tight
These niggas know I get money
Come from Uptown nigga
Where a killing take just a few hundreds
Blast past, smoking on that pound
Shining with my round when my nigga touched down
100 keys on his feet shinin on them 23's
Blowing o's, fucking hoes, watch me throw another G
Strapped in this field nigga, me and my lil' young nigga
Ridin' around your town nigga, getting nothing but money nigga
One hundred


Uh, tried to fuck the world, can't fit
Pockets fat as Saint Nick
All I've got is my niggas, cause a bitch still ain't shit
And I've got kush all in my swisher, these niggas is tissue
I don't believe these niggas, cause I don't believe in superstitions
Juvie, I gotcha 
dreads like rasta, hair like pasta,
 I go meatballs
I get up in that ass and hit it as fast as Chinese ping-pong
And my bitch, she got that fire, my homie got that iron
But I tell 'em put it away or you could get punched like a Hawaiian
Bitch it's Tunechi F Baby, I'm an original Hot Boy
My dick feel like a prisoner cause this bitch got lockjaw
I'm so feeling myself, Truk everybody else
My redbone is ice cold, I'mma fuck the bitch till she melts
Uhh


Bitch I'm N-O till I G-O
I can't change if I tried
I look to my left
I look to my right
And time ain't on my side

55% of these niggas is fake
The other 45% be handlin they weight
55% of these women is hoes
The other 45% be playin they role
Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer

Fuck ya if ya hatin, nigga save that then

Why, why, why
Why, why
Cash Money, rich niggas
Look

Loud pipes, big rims
Nigga, that's my life
When I pull up at the club sorry that's my night
I know a lot of haters probably sayin' that that's not right
Well, my diamonds so much bigger
So, that's my life
Bling Bling
Now, I only carry big faces and you hear the ching, ching
Now, you can ask your wife and she will say the same thin'
And your children be amazed when they see me on the big screen
Ha, ha, ha
I crack myself up
I know I talk lot but I can back myself up
Got a little house on the beach that's where I shack myself up
You ain't really got more money than me
Think about it
Let's just say somebody gave me a check and took the ink up out it
So I just bought a new Rollie and got to take a link up out it
And me with no ice is like a Prince concert that ain't crowded
They see the Beam, and the truck, and the B-12
And we was next
Then that's when I pull up in the B-E-L
Le-Le-Lex
Ha

I'm on fire
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
We on fire
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

Juvenile used to be R-T-A bound
Now I be bustin' these bitches head when I come 'round
Acting like a nigga that ain't never had shit
Look into my bed sayin' that's a mad hit
I'll damned if these diamonds and golds ain't shinin'
My Rollie ain't windin' my bank ain't climbin'
You lookin' at a multi-millionaire in the flesh
Might don't have it now, but I just got me a check
I can walk it like I talk it, play it how I say it
Teach it like I preach it; now, put that in your head
Nigga, bet a thousand, shoot a thousand - ain't nuttin'
Smoke a pound, pop the Cristal and drink somethin'
Meet me in the casino, way in the back
Losin' money like a motherfucker, still shootin' craps
Tomorrow I'll be back, I got millionaire status
We make so much money IRS be lookin' at us

I'm on fire
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot
We on fire
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

I got more ends than Bunny have in a factory
I'm Lil Turk, I'm livin' large, got the baddest hoes after me
Picture me, a young nigga ballin' out of control
Playing with millions, laying in condos
Nigga I shine, shine through the fuckin' week
The fliest ride with Cristal in the passenger seat
Don't hate me, cause I'm a little baller
Got more weight than Angola
Fucking your girl Carla
Nigga I stunt
And I'ma a stunt til I can't no more
Chest lit up like the oaks
From the diamonds I sport
Yo, I can't be touched
Don't think I'm too much, nigga I'm rich what the fuck
Rolex crushed out with the bezel
And in order for hoes to get close to me got to be on my schedule
I got so much money
I don't know what to do
Buy isles and cars
And break bread with my crew

Hear me
It's like, monkey see, monkey do
Rollin' with the Cash Money runners I stay true
Cause when were runnin' and climbin' on the million-dollar scene
Holding together, know what I mean, know what I mean
When I bring out the rubber around the Hummer
Don't nobody have a Benz or the Lex Bubble
When I start they said I had no fame
Now all the girls just end up calling my name
Ten G's to ???
Fax the contract to big Cash Money
Cause you know this whole clique right with me
They're right with me
Sip-pe-di-dy
Won't count the diamonds just around my neck
X amount of dollars on a bankroll check

Those that got me wicked, then I do some free

Gone Ride With Me,400 Degreez,1998.0,"I'm charging six hundred for some big Os
You do business with me, you coming back to get more
My shit is fire, cause it's jumpin' back to twenty-nine
So a nigga shouldn't have no problem bout me gettin' mine
If you come at me with a short I must say shop closed
Motherfuckers try to get smart you gon' get popped ho
I buck with niggas out the Jake like Will and Paco
Have conversations for bitches until they got drove
Picture me gently getting twisted off the indo
Baby, Lil Wayne, B.G., and me committing sins though
Better beware because we bout to spend a bend though
Don't get caught out without the shit cause you will end though
Me and my people got to hustle just to pay the rent
Some of us not in the position that we say we in
Can't have no bill collectors coming through my residence
That's why everyday I be runnin' for the presidents
All that knockin' another nigga, shits irrelevant
You get your head busted for playin' with my intelligence
Yeah

My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Be up in the ride with me
Do a homicide with me, who, me
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Be up in the ride with me
Do a homicide with me, who, me
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me

You making shit more complicated than it should be
You feel your death is comin' soon whodie it could be
Nigga got killed because they never understood me
I know your block is similar to how my hood be
This nigga with all of this playin' gettin' on my nerves
He callin' me up on the phone sayin' he want a bird
I told his daddy that's not how I handle business, man
How I know you not turning state and you be witnessin'?
Doing business with you I'm not even considerin'
How to be in the safe get around that you niggas in
I move too fast, remember patience is a virtue
And keep your eyes open cause niggas gon' observe you
They waiting for the perfect time that they can hurt you
And if they catch you off your basis they gon' serve you
I wonder if my people locked up still remember me
I'm talkin' bout Tulane and Broad, and penitentiaries
All my niggas

My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Do a homicide with me
Be up in the ride with me, who, me
My nine is gonna die with me
Pick up the supply with me
Do a homicide with me
Be up in the ride with me, who, me

I already got you listening to what I said
You better straighten up, there, soldier 'fore I bust your head
Ho if you got something you better not even show your face
Cause a nigga been doing bad and might explore your place
Look, you know you not about it cause they know you fake
If you want to go to war I know what it take
Come with a team of choppers, not no thirty-eight
And we gon' turn this 211 into a murder case
And me a Russell gon' get dizzy out the Thunderbird
And start a nuclear revolution right up on your curb
Niggas keep fuckin' with me cause they know I'm gettin' large
My truck is sitting on twenties, and I'm hittin' broads
If you get beside yourself, then you got to go
You creepin' on the C-M-B's that's not possible
I hit a fifty out my chopper and I got some more
You say you ready for me whodie I don't really know
No

My nine is gonna ride with me
My nine is gonna die with me

Let a nigga know where they at so ain't no stoppin' us
If you handle yo business right I'ma promote yo ass
You bitch out and try to kite I'ma come smoke yo ass
The shit that I'm givin' you they tryin' blood ta get
The vicks be runnin' through because they love the shit
So don't come with that no one buy it the shit was poo
Niggas tried ta rob me nobody was comin' through
Snitches I can't have that
Bitches I can't have that
Riches you can have that
Just bring me my cash back
Look its all gravy with me go head and shine
That's how you play it with me ya big tyme
All I want is the Gs
With a trunk full of keys
A Benz on twenties
You got something you can lend me
Shit nigga I ain't doing nothin' for me for free
Can't put no trust in you niggas cuz yall be tryin' ta run G
Cause I don't like dreamin' 'bout makin' no cheese
Wanna see my muthafuckin' bank account O.D.ed

Until then I'ma be thuggin' behind a project buildin'
Smokin' that fire be with the ghetto children
Plottin' on a way that we can make a million (million lawd lawd)

My jacket off appearin' them
Some a say it's numerary
Partners in for sipperin'

Look at what I did to them
Niggas wearin' Reeboks instead of Nikes and Timbalands
Bitch niggas I be tippin' 'em
My mac nine it be flippin' 'em
Some of these niggas is tryin' ta run G
So I be gippin' 'em
They would do the same to me
Niggas ain't no family
Shit is all a game to me
But nobody gone handle me
Four hundred degreez
Tottin' guns runnin' with me
No wonder we need
Mo money 1 could receive
Nigga wanna deal with this Christ
I'ma put it open in his life
Never should I fuck with me right
Why you keep duckin' me shy
I'ma knock ya head off
Nigga tryin' ta get to ya fuck tryin' to play it off
You made the beef nigga so why is you scared
If you mind yo fuckin' business then yo life would be spared
I can't see it
Nigga try ta make me out a bitch I can't be it
I had a muthafuckin' problem with niggas like freed me
You probably can save yall self but you can't save yall neighbors
Um, and now I got cha spinnin' on round like a baseball playa
Put on this potato on the end of my nine
Foolishness I entertain to keep these niggas in line
Look cause I don't like to dream about makin' no cheese

I told her, ""If ya fuck everybody, it's all gravy.""
She didn't say nothin', she stood there lookin' at me crazy
Then she got mad, and called me bitches and motherfuckers
I waited 'til I got by the door, reached back and snuck her
She did what any bitch woulda did, and got the law for me
Talkin' 'bout go and press charges and get her pa for me
I told 'em, ""When I get outta jail, I'ma beat ya awfully
And open up fire at your pa to back him up off of me.""
All she wanted to do was scream out ""Juvy""
While I hit her from tha back and smack her on tha booty
Bite tha titties, get tha head, break tha bed
Pull off tha rubber and bust a nut on her leg
Some of these hoes be tellin' me, ""I'm just an admirer.""
I don't wanna fuck ya - shit, I got that fire

Got us a fire connect and went off
Got jammed with this broad that rent cars
Wasn't tryin' to change the game, just be in it
Didn't give a fuck if we balled for 3 minutes
Snatch all the hoes and 'bauds and ree' tennis
Niggas can't survive the shit that we been in
Jack niggas to get some cheap linen
The ones that refuse we put 'em to sleep in it
Got up in the mornin' for class and play hookie
Some of us is veteran some of 'em stay rookie
Bitch couldn't talk to us if she wasn't fuckin'
Ya either be bout it or look and keep truckin
Police drew causes and tried to cross lines
We stuck to the code we lived and died by it

Now put ya box in the mud
Get ya Glocks in ya gloves
Ride drops on dubs
We gon' live by that
Make the snitches catch a cut
Soldier pistol nigga what
Hit the block and open up
We gon' die by that
Now put ya box in the mud
Get ya Glocks in ya gloves
Ride drops on dubs
We gon' live by that
Make the snitches catch a cut
Soldier pistol nigga what
Hit the block and open up
We gon' die by that

If war ever came we held the fort down
Back, slowed up, we switched and sold pound
Stayed on point to make some more green
Get our stash away from dope fiends
Nigga had a habit he supplied his own
Always stay hot 'cause we ride with chrome
We kept a little work for the ki's and bones
Crowds draw heat so we be's alone
We learned how to keep our mouth closed and watch
Them other motherfuckers fall off the block
24/7 all around the clock
We hustlin' of course in the gamblin' spot
We had a chance to stop, we still wasn't ready
Shit kept comin' so we made more fetti
Police drew causes and tried to cross lines
We stuck to the code we lived and died by it",https://genius.com/Juvenile-g-code-lyrics

(Off top playboy)
H.B's and The B.G.'s
(What's happing little B.G. bring it to these niggas)

When I got that iron in my hand I'm goin' to slang it
When I got that drama on my mind I'm goin' to bring it
I ain't backin' down from no nigga that's nathan'
If the nigga say I ain't bout my business look here he hatin'

Coming uptown playboy we gonna slang it
If I catch you down bad nigga leave ya stankin'
Fucking wit my H.B's nigga I'm gonna bring it
Rollin' uptown stay strap and keep thinkin'

Cause a nigga get stolen
Better yet get takin'
Paper is burn
They come fast, ya can't shake it
Picture this my brother Cash Money done went nation
That come's from seven hard years of dedication

Fuckin' with B.G. nigga
I'm puttin' on your face and I'm a kill me a nigga
That's believin' worth six figures we call hard hitters
We uptown riders and we real with this nigga, nigga

Police can investigate but they ain't gonna find shit
But a hundred bullet shells without a fucking fingerprint
This Hot Boy click laid back and spy on niggas
We see them workin' on somethin' look here we riders
Ain't like workin' niggas
Any block with a flussy
That goes for the boss too
We ain't got no picks to choose it
We get cha if we gotta
Wig split cha if we gotta
I know you ain't got word that B.G.'s a rider
So keep it on the D.L
If you got keys don't serve nobody but off V.L
Cause they play for keeps
A one way ticket to hizell
Six feet deep
It's a filthy dirty rizell
On the U.P.T
I was raised in the streets
But I put it on my mind
By the time I was nine
I was pushin' nigga
I was slangin' that nine

Na, Na, Na, Na
Now them them don't want us
They know me and Turk don't fuss in the corners
They already know that we brothers, Blood
Or whatever you wanna call it
Click up wit my dog we get crazy like alcoholics
Plus we ballers
So whatever we spin the Lex or Benz
Its gonna be on twenny, twen, twens

Get off the block when we come nigga (nigga)
To the lane
Shots that close shop when the bullets start spraying
Run your mouth too much, better watch what cha sayin'
Like a nigga on the sideline, nigga we ain't playin'

Na, Na, Na, Na
Now why O why Lord
The nigga wanna try and die Lord

Niggas wanna learn hard way
Give it to 'em like that
Make 'em suffer
Put that bitch wit a bag

I guess you probably standin' there sayin, ""Who's the muthafucka?""
Nigga Juv's the muthafucka, that'll bruise a muthafucka
Either there's been a lot of cross-firin' in the brick
s
And I'm gonna kill me a nigga
If they put me in that shit
Look I'm gonna tell ya like I tell my folks
Play with me if you want but Cash Money goin' broke
Even if it means creepin' up slow
Bustin' out shots out my black Volvo
Fo sho, cause ain't nobody gonna run me
I don't want nobody going to tell my mama when somebody done me
She ain't bring me in the world for that
She ain't raise no ho's
She could have had a girl for that
I been realized, I'm all in
Surrounded by the camouflage, in ballin'
Make a nigga recognize, I'm starvin'
Go in and do a homicide, you fallin', stop callin'
Cause ain't no peace treaties whodie
You better not leave that forty-five at your house cause you gonna need it whodie
I told you boy, I'm a soljah boy
U.T.P up on my stomach from the 'Nolia boy

Slangin' nine
Fo sho nigga
That's how we layin' it down for the ninety-eight all the way to the ninety-nine

Slangin' nine

Pardon me, but I got paper to chase
Now cut through the talking and bring me straight to the safe
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensic to trace
I got a problem on my hand, a few bills I ain't been payin'
I figured about a lil' less than 75 grand
And my dog Rocky caught a nickel for a pistol
Its serious when the federales comin' to get you!

Better tighten up your act, you bout to get loose, fool
Move all your valuables, cause them boyz at your throat with them calicos
I mean, me myself, I just don't wanna see nobody get hurt
Wanna live? Keep your black ass from out of my turf
You look like wanna of them boyz that ain't never been fucked over
I'm 'bout to change that, send that boy to tha Nolia
Put a pistol in his face, make em' empty out his pockets
If he think we fakin', he gon' know after we cock it
And come to the CJ's, if you wanna score something
Get my peeps laid cause we make motherfuckers catch the cut quick
Might laugh with ya but we ain't to be trusted
I tie my solja rag tight around my head man
Now I'm gettin' processed with a red band

We release with ammunition when our beef is in site
Way up in your jurisdiction, bout to turn up the light
No vest, no chest whodie, jeopardize your life
Now we ain't got to explain it to ya, this for everybody
Throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up
Throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up
But throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up
But throw ya sets up nigga, throw ya sets up

Solja's be camoflaugin'
Hitting blocks realla, they be bout ridin
You get chopped realla, at any timing
Cause in that Nolia they play tha game raw
No more beats closin' shop when the beef start
Ah, ah, I don't think you're ready for these niggas
LDTC-6 coated wild willas
Head bustas, and wig splitas where I'm from
Choppas max, with red dots in the drum
Playing it rawer than dope
That's how we play it, ducking Chris, flat top & big red
Wootay ain't nothin' nice
Spin corners in broad light, can't move stiff like ice
Get killed if the price on yo face, me & Juve burn with Ks, from the scene
With fled
Take hits like black & moe did back in the dayz
At night in tha nolia, niggas be in tha hallwayz

Nigga done flashed up, I had to deal with the bitch
Catch em down bad, and put some steel on tha bitch
Let em know this young nigga, ain't to be fucked wit
Two timer  coming through, one time you gettin ya wig split
When I release, aiming straight for your top
Non stop hallow points nigga, you gon drop

In tha rover, choppin' ya down, put your sets up nigga
Represent that uptown

Fuckin' wit these real boyz, I'mma kill ya
You don't want me out chea', you know I'mma gorilla

Molded on tha streets and used to running wit thugs

Don't make me come down there and blow one of you bitches

Power,Rejuvenation,2012.0,"I'm from the hood and I represent (power)
J. Prince, nigga, that's (power)
V-12 engine, that's (power)
Electric company, I need (power)
Satellite dish, bitch (power)
You can't charge up shit without (power)
You want to know what make the world spin? (power)
You're running low so nigga, plug in (power)

Power is muscle, there ain't too many niggas with it
Money on my mind, I swear I wear it like a fitted
I'm pouring out my heart to be that nigga in the city
Homies in the hood already saying I done did it
Power's what I got, I show it off cause I could
Field goal kicker, motherfuckers, I'm good
The drop's got a V-12 in it, it go bbrrrrr
And the bitches be like, ""Uhhhhh""
I'm no quitter
I could get a nigga knocked off sitting on the shitter
I wake up in the morning and I call shots
I ain't trying to buy a car, I want the car lot
I'm in a whole nother tax bracket
Shop addict, a nigga got a Saks habit
I talk money boy, take heed
They get the picture when I say cheese


Power is something that you develop on the block
Pull up on a bad bitch sitting in a drop
Top down and a young nigga smelling like money
Coke cologne, now come and get a brick from me
Born in the ghetto, now a nigga in a mansion
Looking at my bezel and that motherfucker dancing
Power is something that get a nigga questions answered
Now these hoes so romantic
Look at me balling, we courtside at the game
Twenty for the ticket, 'nother hundred for the chain
Count money, money machines they going ccccccrrrrrrr
So that mean a nigga full
Nigga got to get it in the sun like a dog
Way before the watches, I'm the motherfucking boss
Money come with power and I think we got it mastered
Snatch the bird out the plastic


Power is respect, you gotta get it in the mud
Check the DNA, see if it's really in the blood
Motherfuckers talking about me say I'm a thug
They figure since I'm balling up packets from the drugs
Niggas in the kitchen mixing dope like a chemist
They pray that I'mma lose it -- that ain't in my religion
Boy, I drive birds down South like a pigeon
You ain't sitting on a hundred million, you ain't living
Smoking on kush, it's smelling like ass
I run through a quarter million like grass
Scarface, bitch -- I'm feeling like Brad
I'm a underground king like Chad
I'm in the mansion with an opal model Marilyn
She told me I was dope -- no heroin
Power make a nigga show his arrogance
Let's break it down -- bring the barrels in",https://genius.com/Juvenile-power-lyrics

My daddy tol' me I ain't shit wit outta occupation
So I played the game
Bust yo head if you said my name

Oh you want some of dat fire dope you can score in da bricks
You disrespectin' my mind cuz you keep comin' short
I might hitcha wit dat iron cuz you need ta be taught
You keep showing yo teeth cuz you thank its a joke
You mus thank deez bullets ain't real and you ain't gon' git smoke

Hell look boy you betta tell deez niggas

Tol' me not to eva letta nigga screw me
Tol' me if I eva did he would do me
Gave me two guns and sent me round dey shootin'

Hardest niggas on tha block started actin like a woman
Tha four foot stranger in ya area bustin'
Load it up and slide it in
Cock it back pop it out we ridin'
Look, look I'll run in a busta spot
I'll sit on a busta porch
I'll sleep on a busta block
Apply five and then let go

And runnin' to a gun if you feel
That they ain't gon' do you shit cause ya real

I'd rather see it on TV than see it in person
Having my fucking' head hurtin'
When dem thirties be burstin'
Bet if yo beef see ya he ain't gon' wait fo' ya dog
Our all gon' try to rearrange ya face fo' ya dog

You ever had corns on your fingers 
from squeezing the mack to much
Nigga be rhyming the dice game where me and lil wack grew up
Tripping stolen strip cars for a living
Stayed away from home when ever they was bitchin
We used to rush the customers for sales when they pull up in cars
Until undercovers started putting us behind bars
Menace to society is all we watch
In the back seat straped with the throw away Glocks
I got some partners in the business never seeing the light
Your people would got ya Cochran if your cheese be right
You know I've been holding it down playa you a dog
I'm a real nigga I ain't gonna stop accepting your phone call
I'm a blow and toss a ho for you, like I'm supposed to do
I'm serious and focused too, you know I'm overdue
The first nigga to park a Rolls Royce in the bricks
While I fly private jet out of town by a bitch


Tryin to be here to see my seeds, when they have they seeds
Long as I breathe ain't nothin in this world that they can't be
Yeah I done fucked up, slipped and sniffed that coke
Started tweakin and broke in them people house next do'
Shot a nigga for smokin rocks on my mom back porch
Damn near graduated and got on that dope
My, work is an art, I am better than smart
Homey I hustle with a strategy that's never been taught
I can make the coke flip, I can make a ho strip, I can spray the whole clip
I take nothing from no bitch
I got the money in the case, 45 in the waist
Pitbulls in the yard so stay away from my gate
Could you believe a nigga feelin like he still ain't ate?
Huh, y'all don't understand you shoulda seen my plate
Would love to give you some credit, but even you said it
Be serious about your money and right now I'm tryin to get it


I'm on a mission lil' daddy
Put this paint on the caddy
Nigga ridin threw the hood and we blowing on candy
Stay G'd up from my head to my feet
I was raised in the 3rd that's the heart of the streets
Saw death and crime for the first same time
Them rims on shine just a vision of mine
Put this shit back together cause I stay on the grind
Nigga know I gets me I stunt all the time
For the dead and the gone, the young and the grown
O.G. mother fuckers who be getting it on
Niggas stunting and they shining bling blingin all the timin
I hold my hood down for the shit that I'm driving

Walk block for block
And if we got beef with a nigga we'll go Glock for Glock
No mo sellin' keys on the D.L
I wanna holla at V.L
Lets say rest in peace to L and T nigga

I live my life on full
Unzip my pants and I pull
A big dick baby
You look sick maybe
You can use a nigga that'll hold ya hand
I tell ya what ya suck my dick I'll be your man
Now here it is diamonds for the bitches that I fuck
Not , I get the pussy make like Donald and duck
To the next project scattered site or crib
Slangin' dick where you live
I don't really give, a precious second of my pimp playa time
You can taste the kool-aid but don't drink the wine

And these diamonds shinin' from here to Magnolia Projects
Ya heard me?
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout man ain't nothin' like man
Cause you know sometimes I let these lil girls
Lick my chains man you know
You can't be kissin' on me but you can kiss my diamonds
And shit ain't nothing wrong with that that's beautiful baby
That is truly beautiful
This shit is pimpalicious see what I'm sayin'
I just love that",https://genius.com/Juvenile-off-top-lyrics

Drop head phante-um, drive a new millenium
Drowsy than a motherfucker, sippin' on Promethazone
Diamonds and Audemars, face Sierra Leone
Call my daddy and that powder, powder in the bathroom
Pyrex in my memory, these pussy niggas envy me
Call in my new Bugatti and I'm makin' history
Pussy niggas lollygag around, I show no sympathy
Hit 'em with that .44 chopper, bullets in my enemy
Pain in my vocal cord, chronic in my visual
Monster,  Beast Mode, 56 Nights was pinnacle
Chinchilla scattered on my floors of my living room
Marble floors in this bitch, I fucking need a centerfold

One of my niggas in Dallas he went up there
He was walkin' but he came back in a Beemer that's how ya 'posed to do
When he got back to New Orleans, he went and built him a palace
The best that money could offer cause he was overdue
And then he got him a package and brought it back to the projects
So he could break that bitch down and put all his niggas on
Sellin' cocaine is a talent that he picked up from his parents
And he was after the challenge to be a million strong
He told his homies he had it
When they came over they grabbed it
He told 'em never come back cause it ain't gone be no more
He knew it all was a gamble
That's why I stayed the realest and gave an example to let the people know

Lil whodie keep that dog food on him
Lil whodie keep that dog food on him
My niggas, ain't nobody realer than my motherfuckin' niggas
Lil whodie keep that dog food on him

You gon' have to get with me anyway, ain't nobody touchin' that spot
And I'll be the nigga that'll cool yah down, you be meltin', chick you're too hot
Excuse me for being disrespectful, can't help the shit cause I'm rhyming
You prolly one of them people down with that selfish shit, but I'm not
I love women, I'm here for 'em, I cut for 'em, they been knowin'
I spend on 'em, I sin for 'em, pay light, gas, and rent for 'em
I talk to 'em, I mentor 'em, they talk crazy, I ignore 'em
I gave one of my ribs for 'em, I sleep with 'em, I live for 'em
I ain't ever like pancakes, she can't back it up when it's flat
If your breath's stinkin', don't conversate, you better cover your mouth and get back
These hoes party 'til sunrise and this club is closin' up early
I was told they got ass in here, so I came in here to get service
x2

Got everything in my Maybach, the only thing I need is an oven
I don't know what you sippin' on, but my Sprite cost 4 hunna
South side until I die, I cannot lie, identify
My name tag between her thighs, she got an onion booty, I'm finna cry
Eat french fries with my French ho, make a ho dip like french toast
And you know I keep that D. Wade, so I got a mothafuckin' heat close
POW! RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR AHH! POW POW! Nigga, lay it down
Ass so motherfuckin' fat, ain't no way around
Her ass so motherfuckin' fat, ain't no way around
Her ass so motherfuckin' fat, ain't no way around it
G5 watch me switch the climate, money tall, you gotta climb it
Then I do my dance behind it, put both of my hands around it
x2

You got too much ass for a toilet seat and I'm wonderin' how you gon' shit
That booty poppin' like choppers, one of my homies almost got hit
Where you been, you been hidin' out, I been lookin' for yah, can't find yah
I'm tryna put a new team together like Beyoncé and Rihanna
With big titties and big ass, she been pretty, she been bad
She got money, she pop tags, she not dumb and she not trash
I just saw her, she slip fast, she turn necks like whiplash
Got real hair and got real ass and she exercise it like gym class
Niggas like to play games and shit, but see, me, I take the bitch from 'em
I'ma find a spot in her heart soon as I drive the dick in her stomach
I'm glad the club ain't a sausage festival, cause if it was, I'd have to leave early
I heard the booty was up in here, so I came in here for one purpose

Nigga it's a pretty day, and it's flossin' season
Added six tires to my new machinery

Pretty broads and we fuckin these superstars
Chrome rims, niggas ridin' new Benz
TVs, Cadillacs with the new fends
Wet paint, niggas takin trips to the banks
Hittin malls spendin' twenty G's like stars

Just to show these stupid hoes that we worth something
My stuntin' name Evel Knievel, keep it real
Let me pop a wheelie, hoes love stuntin' 'cause I got love
Gold slugs, stunting cause we got love
Motorbike button rims cause we living right
Game tight take a tramp make her holla champ
Overnight got the yola if your money right
Solid TV's PlayStation with the B.G
It's all gravy playboy cause it's flossin' season
A million dollars ain't nothing to me nigga
But a million hoes is game to me playboy

Nahh nahh, flossers, let me see you rollin' your rims
Ballers, helicopters, bikes, and Bourbans

Ballers, helicopters, bikes, and bourbons

Let 'em know it's flossin' season everywhere

I got to get my shine on, do it every time
Seventeens on up, that's all I ride
In ninety-eight, I been havin' them hoes throwin' up
They don't know if I'm in a helicopter or in a truck
I fuck they head up, cause I floss so much
Police had me up cause a nigga so young (ha bruh?)
But you know me nigga
That ain't gon' stop B.G. nigga (at all)
Cause the next day you will see nigga
Me in somethin' else with a TV nigga (f'real)
Fuck it, I'ma floss like that I got scrilla
Come try to take it, you're fuckin with a gorilla
I got a watch you can see from a block away
I got a chain you'll see that'll shock the day

If it ain't no overseas type shits - I ain't gon' drive it
This ain't the summer to swing the top off
This the season niggas come out on them twenties and ball
It ain't no secret I'm a stunter, like Evel Knievel
Jumpin out Lex's and Hummer's, showin' off for my people
When I pull up in V.I.P. they say that's a nice car
Bitches all in my face can't even make it to the bar
Me, broke and assed-out? Never that man
I got some shit up in my ear you can see from a airplane
I don't think Super D. can pull a stunt like me
Got karats on both of my pinkies, ten thousand a piece
Today I might lay low with Kent I built my house in the East
Fuck that, I'ma play bourbon it's a thousand a suite

Who had the, first bourbon with the livin' room set
Who the only nigga you know that drive a burgundy jet
How many cities you know, named after me? (uhh..)
It's gon' be a bunch of them motherfuckers when I finish G
Now baby - I know you missed us
Big daddy light up a room like Christmas
Shine like a light bulb - rich thug
Let that little girl come over here and give a millionaire a hug
McGyver ain't liver than a, Big Tymer
Big dick a million dollars and a, Pathfinder
Mr. Betty Crocker cake maker, casino breaker
Tell Shaq I got a half a mill' ridin on the Lakers
Pack my bitches up and move to the hills
Thirty days a month - thirty Automobiles
The Lexus or Benz that come out in the year two thousand
I got one of them bitches parked around corner by the housin'
The bike I got come out in the year two thousand ten
Eleven fifty zuke with the batman fin
The ring I got, Liberace want it
He couldn't afford that bitch but I can afford to flaunt it

A Hoe,600 Degreez,UnKnown,"(Verse 1, Skip)
When y'all gon' learn we don't live like y'all?
We gon' choose our time to go; somebody gon' kill y'all!
I tried to reach y'all, couldn't feel y'all
I listen to what'chu sayin', but what'chu sayin, That wasn't real dogg!
I could spit a verse and kill y'all
Do the people that buy y'all shit take the time to hear y'all?
Probably not, probably listen to the tracks
I know you gon' hate this one; listen to the facts
How you pull the nerve to ever start dissin' niggas
When you was on BET straight kissin' niggas?!
I'm from Holly Grove, you're background prissy nigga, pissy nigga!
OBC, come and get me nigga
I was in the hood yesterday, had a talk wit'cha uncle
He say ""stay where you at"" 'cause ""the hood don't want'chu!""
They gotta crew clipped up, waitin' just to pump you
In any one of them whips that'chu whip when you come through

(A hoe) What kinda nigga kiss another man?! (A hoe)
What kinda nigga need his mama to hold his hand?! (A hoe)

400 a ship, ain't nothin' comin' after me

You playin' wit me
Wit' my hood on your album cover?
Real street niggas gon' know you fake as a motherfucka
I'ma still be here after your company flops
Waitin' for my fuckin' album to drop
One of my niggas got fucked up, and one in jail
Will they ever get they shit right? Time will tell
The only thing that called shots, whoadi, is balls
And I ain't hearin' no kinda communication from y'all
U-T-P, designed to be the finest in the business
And we climbin' up the chart with the dependants
Ya feel it? Ya gotta be deaf not to hear it
Because I puts nothin' but the truth in the lyrics

Won't'chu come down Olive, won't'chu come down Eagle?
Won't'chu come down Clayborne where someone can see you?
Just pass down Hamilton, anywhere in the Grove
Any one of them whips; we gon' fill 'em with holes
Remember the cats you ran with? Red and Bubba?
They begged me to tell you ""fuck you"", so fuck you!
You disgraced your mother, actin you actress
Who's really your daddy? Rabbit or 'Atrice?

Peep this shit out, lil' one:
This is how the fuck we do it, boy

My pockets flooded with money like it been rainin' for months
Put Jackie Chan outta business, tha way that I live stunt
Man, I'll spend fifty G's on just a chair and a sofa
Got tired of all that drivin', so I got me a chauffeur
Gettin' head watchin' TV on tha block of Magnolia
Give tha kids twenty dollars when I open my door
My grill like marble floors, was workin' with four
After we score, I laid there and got me six more
Now my body needs ta be treated, I'm 'bout to get weak
Full of that shit, gon' kill that man, he got me hungry and greedy
They call my watch tha North Pole cuz it's flooded with ice
It's a...bitch in tha day, a motherfucker at night
If somebody get my jewelry they'll be set for life
Buy a house before tha wedding, and a ring for tha wife
Money ain't shit ta me because I'm young and I'm blessed
I don't..carry no cash, it's credit cards or checks

Got a hundred on my left, fifty on tha wrist, ho
Fuck, I be shinin' from tha clothes, cars, jewelry
Got seven-year-old children wan' grow up to be like me
Niggas pullin' up, drivin' off tha showroom floor
Got a mouth full of gold so I can boot these hoes
Somebody asked me tha time, I just had ta look back
Showed them tha baguettes on my watch and say how I could see that
Got trillion cut earrings so I can blind these hoes
I'm tha number-one stunna fuckin' rap-hoes (rap-hoes)
Stun'n is a way of livin', ya fuckin' with my clique
Try ta pay tha dealership that sell tha shit that don't exist
I got all my hoes ridin' Lexus coupe, two-door
Put tha Cadillac up, it was movin' too slow
We Cash Money stunnas - money long as tha street
You wan' verify our cash, go ask First NBC, nigga

Walkin' round you like you took care and you handled your beef
Pissed off cause your ho wanna come talk to me
To show me the little gift that she done bought for me
I take it back to when the Big Tymers was pushin' the size
When niggas wore Dickies suits like it was regular jobs
We cop Adidas, ghost town and Anita's used to be packed
And rumors started poppin' and it started to crack

Let her bounce with a gangsta out six coat
Let her wil' out and flick it off a disco
Let me gas up, dick her down and get ghost
Ain't trickin' for the vagina, I like to get throat
Yo' stupid ass tryin' to stay in here and lick toes
Good girls love G's, that's how the shit go
That's why niggas need to tighten up and get low
I know you heard of *clap-clap*, I'm gettin' doe
Let me check my palm pilot, I'm gettin' hoes
Let me check my squad' wallets, we gettin' close
My squad up in the crowd wilin', they spittin' more
Drive by in the '5-5, forget a '4
Five, five and another five, we get a show

If they ask you where I'm at I'm in the Melph pickin up Chuck
In a chromed out bubblegum pickup truck
Slide on Josephine, holla at Lil' Kia and Pluck
My nigga Troy'll tell it, hey they keep it real as fuck
We goin' to House of Blues tonight after the DJ in the Nolia
On Washington and Freret, across the street from Babosca
But first I'm bout to snatch up all Saratoga
Head straight to Foot Action and snatch me two pair of Soldiers
Take a left on Toledano get a oh of that doja

Let's hit Gert Town, I heard they pop it off
Or hit P town, I heard they drop it off
My cousin Leaf from the Vill told me to swing through, on St. Lou
He got two hoes that'll eat and drink too
We can bounce through the Lafitte and we can fuck with these hoes
They take dick in they ass, they take dick in the throat
They take dick in they ear, they take dick up they nose
They take a dick, anywhere your dick can go
But look, it ain't nothin' like my bitch out the St. Bernard
A gangsta broad, get Wacko gangsta hard
She said we might could run a train if I pursue my G
If not I got it poppin' off on Music Street
Last week I had to do about two of them freaks
But them niggas through there be trippin' so bring two of them heats

I see you learnin', see you peepin' out that Nolia Clap
I bet you nine times out of ten that whole Nolia strapped
OK, we fell off for a minute but that Nolia back
We got quarters, ounces, and halfs and birds of smack
Ever since Soulja got killed I keep a murder gat
Stand on the middle of my projects where the murders at
And every nigga, every bitch who ain't heard of Wack
I bang women, bang children, bang them murder cats
I bang blocks, bang cribs, bang the Burban Lac'
I bang anything in sight without the murda tats
I'm just the hit to represent where I was born and raised
And every nigga in my section love to roam with K's
You got beef holla at me, get it on today
You not quickly Uptown Bon Temps Rouler
Knock off your face, taste, waist, take arms and legs
Drop off your neck, wrist, toes, hair, palms, and head

Put bullets in your car, whoever that you are
Whodie get in line
Make sure you ain't gone shine

Just because I'ma bad
I rammy after jags
When I get a sack

Keep on gettin' blowed
Ain't worried bout these hoes
Boy you know that's cold

Shinin' like white diamonds
Nothin' but big timin'
My situation climbin'
But simply cause I'm rhymin'
The shit done hit the fan
They callin' me the man
Y'all boys don't understand
This shit's going as planned

Now follow me now if you want it on
Salute at ease, then you carry on
Nigga drop and gimme fifty if you do it wrong

Salute at ease, then you carry on
Nigga drop and gimme fifty if you do it wrong
I'm into weapons I control the dome

I try to leave that lone
But you did that wrong
You call me on the phone
And told me it was on
Now I'm in them streets
Bringin' all that heat
Straight to where you sleep
Won't even let you eat
Somebody gonna snitch
And go out like a bitch
But I'ma get'em quick
And hit'em with my shit
Them laws gonna try to bust
But I don't give a fuck
He would of shot me up
If he'd of got me stuck
I'ma take my charge
Ain't cryin' like no broad
And holla at them boys

Bust him up and see how many niggas gon' ride for him
Play the project bricks and watch for the law
Nigga come to my section, we to they section and ward
We rep hard out the wards in stolen cars
Spankin' niggas that be showin' off with they broads
Nigga catch a felony... he takin' his charge
Niggas turnin' state... we rapin' the boy
It's a hard life we livin'... day by day drama
We earn stripes for killin'.. attack like a piranas
Some of the time... motherfuckers be off they bases

Ain't no love for outsiders, everybody's a fool
We be duckin' off in the hallways.. and in the cuts
Gettin' the fuck when ATF is pullin' up
People in the projects say, ""Them niggas ain't shit""
They hustle all night for brand new outfits
You're fuckin' right... that's how it is on the block
Grilled up, t-shirt, 'Bauds and Reeboks
Camouflage around the neck and the dome
Fucked-up attitude totin' a chrome
Fighting for weed, nigga ain't ever goin' home
Tryin' ta get it how he live with a bundle of (?)

Get it how ya live is how it is where I be
Fuck a nigga's how I feel, no nigga steppin' on my toes
Without feelin' !BLOCKAH! !BLOCKAH! from four-fours

Pay the Rent,The Fundamentals,2014.0,"You love that hood that you represent
You bout that working and all that money spent
A nigga owe you every cent
My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent
My niggas busting just to pay the rent
Cause bitches nothing we need or set
We reunite nigga when we spend
My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent

NO's my birthplace, thug water my T-shirt
I'm uptown in these hot blocks where there feens walk then this feet heard
It's DJ on rebirth, fat boys on stakeout
No hard heels just chuck taylors
In case I might break up
Right now is drought season
Watch how it's gonna play out
Last night two teenagers got killed up in Jose house
Feel like there's no way out
Guess I gotta just stay down
Play ball and sell dope
Project's my playground
D bought a new condo
He ain't even sleep in his bed yet
Cause this girl all in his D talking 'bout bill he ain't even pay yet
Thought how to be cool with it
Real niggas ain't bad at it
These motherfuckers who owe me
Chopping off their head now


I go back like dro bags
Nigga Michael Jordan nigga 96
Streets dry, I came through
Lebron james Game 6
Drive lane right behind the back
Two cars back on my main drive
They Pulling on they find the bricks
Ain't Worried Bout It cause my mane lie
On Two A pack too fly
Selling in the street no B by
Why they call it white president
Niggas all I see is this green god
Nigga I ain't going to my mama house
Try being my mama mouth
Your trap boomin you ain't rit up
You don't need last for half hour
Tap for they owe me
DEA they want me
Still serve the whole hood out the town
Theat the prices like my compound
Bag landed me the touchdown
They was going for the touchdown
Nigga cask up before they touched down


It's summer town my airport, my house light 400 degrees
Money long my bills high so still flippin money in these streets
Juvenile, I've been wild, big pistols, coke piles
Old Chevy, big wheels
Tight motor, gun loud
Don't know hard
You a bitch nigga
Ten bricks you a rich nigga
Part time i rap nigga
Now out of town i hits niggas
Can't shake my problems
Low key I'll be robbin'
Weapon of choice that .38
Cause I fell in love in revolvers
I ain't leaving no shells
I ain't going no jail
I ain't leaving no witness nigga
Everybody go to hell
Everybody had a struggle
Everybody had a hustle
This everybody who you're fucking with
Nigga why the fuck you coughing?
Is you feel word?
Ain't nothing word
Made a living out birds
Yeah Nigga that's on my word
I'm from retracing palmer
That shit go hard like the Cali-o
Used to dream bout a million
But I woke up and count it though",https://genius.com/Juvenile-pay-the-rent-lyrics
Hide Out or Ride Out,Solja Rags,1997.0,"I strike a load you get served I ain't to be joked with
Fake Buster get smoked with, you provoked it
I explode it, unload it, reload it, unload again and
Put another clip in, 50 Shots to win I can't lose its Impossible
Plus I got a Chopper 50 Shots bout to be droppin' you
I be bout straight hittin' the beef kicker set then
Leave the set and leave a beef kicker wet
Jet off the scene with the Uptown Fighters
Red Dot Sighters, all week Night Flighters
I'ma get 'cha when ya least expect it
Cock the Glock check it, a vest can't protect it boy
Is ya ready? I leave yo set wetted
Slugs flyin' high got ya body real heavy
Ya can't move, ya got bucked now ya stuck
Left wet on the set, tell yo boys to pick ya up
Out cold, head swole, eyes rolled
I know Fa'sho you ain't gone test me no more
Yo block tore, yo Family in black clothes
You got blowed, and in yo chest is many holes
This goes, A Lot of rounds of Ammo
I show how Uptown Niggas drove
Ya fake boy, me and my niggas did it to ya
Automatic, Black Chopper Trigger Pullers
That's how we be, loadin' clips then release
Eight deep, in the 300 E, leather seats, and in the trunk atiliary
Up the street, where I score shoul ain't for me
The B.G. that's  the name I go by
Test me? You die ask Kangol bout it
Hide Out, if ya clip slide out, Ride Out
Yo block bout to die out
Move yo People I'm burnin' down the whole street
The Night Creepers, bout to heat our enemy
Lights Off, Mask On Creep Silent
Life's gone we don't left yo block quiet
Retaliate wait, know you not boy
Cause I'm a Hot Boy, Nine-Milli Cock Boy
Chopper gunnin' you scared, you see us runnin'
Start movin' me and Juvey when we comin'

In yo lap yo brain sit, got a Chopper splittin' through bricks
A young Black Crucifix, up in the dirt I be knockin' dicks
Smooth and Beretically, my pocket rockin' to Six Figures
I'm pulverizin' niggas pullin' AR-15 triggers
On my body there's a side of me
It only come out at night though
Them Demons got me on a flight
Duck Tape'N and takin' life, or even worse
It could be Three O'clock, on a Sunday by Church
Yo brains I'ma have to burst
You shouldn't have fucked with me first
Gettin' full of some Malcolm, Adams Apple I scalp 'em
Got Richard Penington callin' for National Guards to come help him
Very seldom when ya see, when you do what do you do?
Bust back, better be a head shot, if not then it's through
I'm comin' around the corner bout to pull a Meatball on ya
Fully dressed like a hoe, and in my purse is a Calico
Me and Lil Turk if you heard of a merger on a murder
50 G'z on his head, what the fuck did you say?
50 G'z Fa'sho that nigga live next door
Call the man, give him a rang, left the sucker change
Look I fuck with that rap shit, but acts a donkey on the low
A Hot Boy representin' this bitch like Black and Moe

I start to poppin' niggas start to droppin'
I'm havin' fatal thoughts I think I'm fuckin' Shell Shockin'
Niggas bangin' Four, Five rangin' in my ear
I'm not scared, cause I'm Soldier, and Soldiers have no fuckin' fear
In my sleep at night, I'm seein' war fights
Wakin' up thinkin' a nigga took my fuckin' life
Unnecessary shit, mind clickin' like a light switch
Who picked you up on any nigga or any bitch
Don't give a fuck, steady bangin' in dodgin' camouflagin'
With my Mack- Elivin' , Hot Boy$, that whole Ca$h Money Click
Don't fuck with, unless we known to get in yo shit
I'm Shell Shock bitch, only thing on my mind
Kill a nigga with that fuckin' Chrome-9
Don't have time for them dog hoes
Goin' through a stage with that Chopper and that 4-4

What's this shit I hear about you boys Partners-N-Crime
You think you U.N.L.V. punished you bitches the last time
Now you gonna shine, let me put somethin' on yo mind
Look I was born in this bitch for taken hits, and protectin' shit
It's a Fa'sho thing, I'ma bring drama or I'ma wet 'cha
Ya bests be 'bout ya Issue, if not God bless ya
What make you think 2-2-6 wasn't strong?
That's what we do, you wrong
They both com and they gone
Off Toppers, I'ma deal with you and yo Partners
T.C. , L.D. , Willard Street with Choppers
Drama is the need for Ca$h, we play it right though

Respect my steez, I ain't really bout fallin in love
I travel too much and Baby sling too many drugs
Stay in the wrong place at the wrong time
With 2 bricks,(two of 'em) and a chrome 9
To these niggas I'm easy to be provokin'
Look, I got 1 in the chamber and I been smokin'
Don't make me proceed
I'll hit you from ya neck to ya knees
Have ya gaggin' where ya barely could breathe
But I ain't in here for this
Whoadie, I'm in here to get me a bitch
Bring her back to the telly to issue some dick
Hook up with Juve and Skip, go get me a brick
And get ready for next Sunday, to snatch a new bitch

 You can have an ole' lady
     But them hoes
    They for everybody
 Let her go dog, that ain't ya hoe dog
     Let me get broke off
    In this jump off!

I done tightened up on my G dog
I was ducked out at first but now I beat broads
Cock back, BAM! Bash in her teeth, AWW
Guarantee you this, that bitch gone see stars!
Respect my gangsta
I see you looking mad and I ain't 'cha
I know +50 Cent+ and bitch I ain't no +Wanksta+
And I don't get down like that
In the right time, at the right spot
If you try to buck, you gone get shot
Hey fella, calm down. I know what ya thinkin'
But I got 1 in this chamber and I been drinkin'
Don't make me proceed
Spit in ya face, bastard ya seed
Widow ya wife, you don't need my shit in ya life!
Especially how I'm feeling tonight
If it was good, it'd be different
But it's not, so it's not, so let's end it!
And bring this shit back to business
You can have yo bitch dog
I live by the rules I'm givin'


Come on, come on, come on
Grab yo bitch my the arm cuz if she stop she hit
Oh, I know how to get 'em, I hit her with lotsa dick
The simple things I'm knowing that she probably miss
And in return, she going out and buy me shit!
I hope my adversaries is listening:
Motherfucka with tryna be eased from these D-vils
Cuz we evil in this!
I'm not about to waste my cream on a bitch
I be outcher tryna get money, while she scheming for dick
I ain't gone lie, if my ole lady leave a nigga, I'm sick
But fuck it, we ain't married, so she ain't got nothing to get
I had to go in fronta the jury January the 6th
I promise, ya Honor, I ain't been doin' the shit!
They just like to keep niggas like me in a mix
And use it on TV and radio as a skit
Wanna see some masks, move to the bricks
But before you make that move grab the tool and the clips
Ya heard me?

 Let her go dog, that ain't ya hoe dog
     Let me get broke off
    In this jump off",https://genius.com/Juvenile-for-everybody-lyrics
Make U Feel Alright,Cocky & Confident,2009,"(feat. Kango Slim & Jay da Menace)
I can make you feel alright, right
Ay, ay... ay, ay!
Ay...

You can drop the top down, we can ride low
You can be yourself girl, let your hair go
(Guarantee you girl, I can make you feel - alright) 
You can act slick man but you won't know
Bet'cha if I give it to you, you gon' want mo'
(Guarantee you girl, I can make you feel - alright) 
It could be better but nobody can complain here
Just call me Santa Claus, you know I make it rain, dear
You can tell cause I'm livin so well
And my crib lookin like a lil' mini hotel
I know you're lookin for change, you want Barack Obama
Also you're sick of the pain, been through a lot of drama
Leave them heel boys alone, get a man of honor
I ain't a snake but I'm tryin to give you this anaconda
Girl you lookin good wit'cha ol' stiff ass
Kinda remind of somethin I'd see in gym class
Lean through to me and I'll probably trip on him
I got my eyes on him girl and I ain't givin in

Ay back up and let her do her thing
She a queen in search of a king
Stop be doin what you do
When you do your thing, all eyes on you
I can make you feel like a woman wanna feel
And I like the way that back shape when you be in them heels
Don't take 'em off, leave 'em on when we do it
Louis Armstrong daughter, like a horn when she blew it
You know you the one girl, I can see you choosin
Cause you know I'm a winner, and with me you ain't losin
I'm diggin your hairstyle, love the way your face look
Let me take you to MySpace and tag your Facebook
Got'chu feelin me the way that Jada feelin Will
And Hillary feelin Bill, a chick that gon' keep it real - f'real
Kill Bill what I'm smokin on like good
I'm tryin to see if I can hit you with the nice wood

I can make you feel alright
Come over to the crib and give it to ya all night
Cause you got a body like the video type
Daddy comin over, put the Henny on ice
The Remy on ice, go on does it like that
Damn shorty I ain't know you do it like that
Could move it like that - that's somethin that your momma can't teach
You don't care what niggas sayin just go follow that beat!",https://genius.com/Juvenile-make-u-feel-alright-lyrics
Rover Truck,Baller Blockin’ OST,UnKnown,"I'mma keep it on my mind
Stay slangin' iron
Playin', ya die
K's whippin' out
Prey every time
I'm straight off the porch - I live down the court
Lookin' for that dope
Kickin' in your door
Tyin' up your ho
And break the bitches up - run 'em in the cut
I don't give a fuck - if them people rush, they ain't catchin' us
I gotta make the green
Smokin' nicotine
Know a nigga's scheme
Run em' with the beam
Runnin' with my team
...And get it how I live
Keep it how it is
Make a nigga cents
Take a nigga bitch
Hit him with it quick
If it mean bustin' a head, I'm gon' do it
Whatever it takes to get the bread, I'm goin' through it
Tryin' to get my pockets swole up
Juvenile is 'bout to blow up
That third-ward sign I'mma throw up when I take it off of your shoulder
They come with they mask on
They be a clique, but I get 'em gone
Hit niggas in the chest when I'm slangin' chrome
Tryin' to kill me a nigga when the beef is on

Baby, let me get the keys to that Rover Truck
Man, let me get this beef shit over, bruh
Ain't no bitches here up in that Nolia, bruh
Bust your big head is what was told to us

Nigga, I'm straight from out the P.J., they murder easy
Well, if you're spankin' out for three days, believe what we say
Niggas be shootin' that shit in they vein, some of 'em sellin' it
The rest of 'em sniff the cocaine, high off that yellow shit
Young niggas already got they mind made up
Nigga fuck with one of they boys, they get sprayed up
A lot of these children don't have A/C in they house
Cockroaches crawlin' all over the wall and they couch
Little mites runnin' through the kitchen lookin' for crumbs
While they mom hittin' that glass up in the bathroom
Everyday you see a fight or shootout for a minute
It ain't the projects, it's the niggas that's up in it
Man, half of these motherfuckers ain't even from 'round here
If they didn't have that work, they would never come 'round here
And when they come they draw all the heat with 'em
Lookin' for some niggas to get in the beef with 'em


You better know that me and Wayne want the cash, or we bustin' ass
...soon as I get out of my Jag with a gun a mask
Now play it how you say it - I bet ya won't, bitch
I'll have you leakin' from your head when I take (?)
What you want, huh? Boy, that weed or that coke?
I don't know what the fuck you on, but you about to get smoked
I'll bring it to your front door right up on your porch
Until your bitches tell me, ""Juvie, we ain't beefin' no more.""
Now, where the dope at? Paraphernalia?
Give me twenty ki's before I kill ya
Don't be makin' noise, nigga - shut the fuck up
You know where the dope at - now get the fuck up
Bring me straight to it - don't be tryin' to act crazy
I want her - I need her, ya know - that's my old lady
I'm doin' bad, and my nerves bad with it
I'm lookin' at your melon right now, and I wanna split it",https://genius.com/Juvenile-rover-truck-lyrics
Tha Man,Tha G-Code,1999.0,"I'ma stay thuggin', how I came is how I leave
When I say somethin', best believe that's how it be
Motherfuck a suit, yeah, I said it, nigga, I mean it
Bitch was dressin' in gangsta and switch, wodie, I seen it
Wannabe Juvy-fuckin' hoes gon' get you caught up
Me, I wear Reeboks and Girbauds, and play it smarter
If them boys spin tha bend, they go ""bluckahda"" on tha block
I'ma be gettin' somewhere, your ass gonna get shot
You paid 1500; I paid 59.99
Got diamonds and Rolexes that shine at tha same time
I ain't scared, but I ain't dumb, and I ain't stupid
I know how ta survive in tha project and how ta do shit
If I hit a hustle, I ain't tellin' tha biz
'Cause tha witness will tell them people who tha murderer is
Your main man'll put four or five to your wig
Take tha cocaine and throw you off the side of the bridge
Gotta be able to think, gotta know when to move out
Gotta read through the lines, gotta know what these hoes 'bout
Gotta separate your business from your family and friends
Gotta bust a nigga head if he plottin to do you in
I done did dirt, so I know what's tha consequences
Let my shit burst tryin' ta knock out a nigga dentures
Always PQ to see through these fools
'Cause we do the shit that people see on the news
So, follow me now into a world of stress
Where wodie tryin' ta get it all 'cause he don't settle for less
Ain't satisfied 'til all of his beef is put to rest
Slangin' that iron...with a soldier rag on his neck
And credit for they people in case they wanna connect
He ain't hidin', he still ridin'...in the 'jects
Ya gotta be willin' to play tha game to its debt
Nigga bang and...hit you in your brain, now who next
I be cool at all times and acknowledge...when I'm wrong
Shit I went through when tha fans got my game real strong
I'm not tha smartest motherfucker walkin'
But I can tell a fake motherfucker when he talkin'
My daddy always told me, ""Boy, don't be a follower
You got a lot of pride, but some you need to swallow up
You keep that attitude, you won't see tomorrow, bruh.""
I soak it up, and got better as a hustler

I'm a head buster, a straight-up Nolia nigga
Young thugger
Fuck up, I show ya, nigga, that I don't play
Keep a K for protection
With fifty - never run without my weapon
I stand out here, tie ducked with bandanas
I show no fear - what'chu 'bout we can handle
I'm real as they came: a untamed guerrilla
'Bout bustin' your brains, whoever be wit'cha
I have no picks; I split your shit
Whoever you with, I'ma split they shit
Ya steal or get stole, wet or get wet
Bust or get bust on, move a chest or lose a chest
Try not to miss when you cock back and shoot
You shoot and miss, then it's all on you
Ain't no game, it's real dog - live or ya die
Real in tha field, dog - ya live or ya die
Even though I'm a lil' bitty nigga
Look, I got big nuts and they hang low, nigga
I ain't scared ta bust
Want beef, let me know, and look, we can tear this bitch up
You or me, me or you...gon' bite tha dust
Wuz up, nigga? Wuz up, nigga?
You afraid, go ta church, I ain't scared at all
Lose your head fuck with Turk, 'cause I'm knockin' it off
I wan' keep my hands clean, droppin' some change
Niggas gon' ride for me, niggas that's untamed
Niggas who bang that heroin, or snort that cocaine
Niggas out that project don't mind sprayin' thangs
Fools who that slang that iron for me (When tha beef start)
When tha beef start (Be ready to ride for me)
Be ready to ride for me",https://genius.com/Juvenile-tha-man-lyrics

I'm in the jungle, of niggas that's lookin' for static
Two niggas stuck and jackin' just to support his habit
Them people rollin', so I gotta do what I can
I gotta pound of that sand I picked up from the man
The luxuries I gotta have it, black savage
He's in the streets holdin' up traffic
With the plastic, Desert Eagle .45 automatic
My glass is, filled with J.D. and coca-cola classic
And niggas that playa-hate I got somethin' for yo asses
I'ma act a donkey, boy you best not run up on me
You niggas phony, that's why I did that to your homie
For instance, when the Mac-9 will erase your existence
So distance, yourself from me 'cause my conscience be clickin'
Niggas be paranoid when they see I be dippin'
Sayin', man let me go, he bout to stomp on that trigger
Somebodies wig get split in the middle of the street
I got your brains to show you bitches, stop playin' with me
And ain't no thing I got my Ruger and I ain't' scared to die
Cross that line and I'ma shoot'cha and tell your Mommy bye-bye

I know it make you wanna go get it bad
But ya gotta think 'fore ya move, partna
'Cause it'll make your ship sink and you will lose, partna

Niggas use ta knock ya
Stay a big shot, motherfucker couldn't stop ya
Then ya went ta runnin' 'round tha project with them junkies
Holes in your shoes, and your body all funky
Lips all ashy, eyes popped out
Spendin' your children check, takin' food out they mouth
And you get mad with me 'cause I don't wanna give you ten
I don't support your habit, nigga, y'all grown men
I got kids ta feed, I got bills ta pay

Niggas who I come up with get me full of that dope
Use ta care about theyself, ain't care no mo'
Niggas want me ta help 'em.. ain't helpin' theyself

Ain't no love loss... I just gotta stay my distance
Gotta keep my mind straight.. before I come up missin'
Gotta do my rap thing, and make my paper, mister
Ain't gon' let nobody stop me from gettin' my six figures

Would I get tha same attention when I'm in tha next four-door
No, I don't think so, I'll be a equal nigga

On the reala... if I could do it, then you could

Ain't nobody gon' give no hand-outs, I swear
Ain't nobody gon' pay tha bills in your house, I swear
They don't care, ya gotta stand on your own, my nigga

This your boy Juve The Great
Right here with my people sinister
And we about to take y'all back to the old school
That old school gangster shit
Check this shit out

We the only ones with work in the middle of the drought
Then them niggas round the corner come and see what we about
But we don't know they face so we don't want them by the house
But Skipper started bustin when he saw them pullin out
We did them niggas dirty for fuckin up our vibe
We packed up all our shit and moved it to the other side
Visited our spot this girl was on my dick
She said I love you Juvenile but you know you the shit
I grabbed on my Glock its where the fools hang out
I'm only tryin to hustle another change route
But they ain't gettin nothin if I ain't on beam
I'mma leave them niggas sufferin to find they own things
Workin with plenty for talkin 'bout hoes
I don't give them a penny, they comin out they clothes
Grabbin on my jimmy to see if nigga swole
Have to get it right with this big 'ol totem pole

Yes I'm thuggin Yes I'm clubbin
I ain't trippin on you look bitch I'm buzzin
Hoes and niggas I'm not lovin
Fuck what you gettin if I ain't got nothin
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin with that
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin with that
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin
What's happenin, what's happenin, what's happenin with that

The subwoofers bumpin, I need it in my life
We had a couple of fellas was stuntin with they eyes
We jump out of the Lexus and got they mind right
See I ain't gotta rep cause they know I got chains
You can catch me in that ? boy, that money green thang
Get a fish and shrimp po' boy and go sit on St. James
I'm a playa like my ole boy thats where I get game
Goes start passin cause they want me to see 'em
Ain't givin no action if they want some per diem
I keep a soldier rag from the A.M. to the P.M
My heater in my lap lookin great up in the B-M
I know them niggas watchin cause they know that I'm buck
But they can catch a hot one for fuckin with a thug
Nothin was poppin so we went in the club
All the hoes started jockin cause they knew who we was


The owner wasn't trippin, he let a nigga in an
The place was jumpin and the hoes was grinnin
Not at us though it was at the other women
Some was butterscotch some yellow like lemon
Had a couple of foul ones chicken and pigeons
Some was kinda fine but them bitches didn't listen
Told them meet us outside and hoes got missin
Put it in reverse and went back for more women
Everybody's rollin and you can really see it
Look at how they scopin for somebody to be with
I ain't on shit and Ive been G'in since the 80's
Ain't about goin somewhere probably then ""Beat It""
You already knowin the way that I'm rockin
If you anin goin then ain't nothin poppin
Now I'm about to leave cause these niggas eavesdroppin
I got my heater on me now an I don't have to cock it",https://genius.com/Juvenile-whats-happenin-lyrics
Numb Numb,Juve the Great,2003.0,"Ay you won't score key, no you won't score an ounce
I ain't gon' show you shit, make sure you got the right amount
Boy I can't front you nuttin but I respect ya G
It could get fatal if I let niggas get next to me
The junkies like my coke, Doctors, and Lawyers too
They in, and out here all day lookin for the right Peru
I use to do it too but I had to let it go
I can't get loaded I'm lil' wodie that supply the coke
My shit'll have you where you don't even much wanna eat
Have you a lack of sleep always out up in them streets
Been in rehab for weeks come home and get a bag from me
You gon' relapse indeed, probably want ever leave
Don't want no problems I just wanna get this cheddar please
I can't get popped, I've been convicted for two felonies
Look I'm just tryna put some clothes on my daughter
I hope they ain't ridin I need to sell this other quarter

If you score some coke from me
You will be numb, numb, numb, numb, numb
Numb, numb, numb, numb, numb, numb, numb
If you don't get it from me you will be
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
You'll be comin back in minutes to get
Some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some, some
Damn Juvie where you get that
From, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from, from

They don't work off the hit cause we don't fuck with the foes
They be sellin them soft we had enough of them sold
And we work off the hit cause we don't fuck with the foes
We don't be sellin them soft we had enough of them sold
Weigh it and bring it in this shit is shipped to me
I never transported nothin peep out my history
My house is sittin plush-my cars is lookin lovely
Police men wanna cuff me therefore I'm rollin buckets
Not tryna make it public don't wanna be the subject
Mama tunin it don't spend ya money boy stay in ya budget
I seen alot of fools goin buyin alot of shoes
They children not in school they gotta lot to prove
I puts my money back up in my flip
Some to the side incase them people run up in my shit
Chopper up all the time with two taped up clips
And if you come fuckin with mine I'm a use this bitch
They want me for distrubution from New Orleans to Houston
Someone been runnin there mouth tellin e'm how much I'm movin
I'm just tryna put some clothes on my daughter
I hope they ain't ridin I need to sell this other quarter


I got my first work when I was sixteen
And niggas still not knowin what happened to brick leans
It's not an easy task might have to beat the last
You gon' get caught up out here tryna save ya people ass
Can't have e'm bring it first if you can't pay e'm its worth
You could get murdered for that he just may let it burst
Smart high walk to earth, and maybe enemy turf
Pray I don't get in they way just let e'm do they dirt
And I know after the cut woah my shit is the bomb
That must be the Saudi-Arabia cause it ain't Hussien
You ain't got that Florida dope, (??) coke
Have to spend all ya dough or you want leave fa sho
They come in menthazine no caps on it is
Want be that long before ya family know you on that shit
Look I'm just tryna put some clothes on my daughter
I hope they ain't ridin I need to sell this other quarter

'Cause I know this nigga gotta be killed
My good side tellin' me let'em slide cause he ain't worth it
While my bad side tell me to kill'em cause he deserve it
I'm urging to follow my bad side and put a finish to him an
Any motherfucker seekin' his business relentless
Thoughts goin' through my mind nigga had tried to shine
I'm gone be bout that iron in this foolishness frame of mind
In the front door actin a donkey wit the .44
Left him funky snatched the monkey and the Benz wit the Momo's
Tired of havin' nothin' wearin' my brother's clothes
Many times I got drove by niggas in front of hoes
You know how it be dog you ain't been ballin' all your life

Buildin' escape mobile all fixin' the grill cheese
In the store breakin' snamps crown dirby a key

Seeking vengeance with no repentance now, man is, labeled a menace
By Lieutenant Fuck 'em Juv
Which enables me to conduct an attitude
Look here
How many of you niggas ready to start Big Tymin'
Look here
How many of you niggas wanna be ridin' reclining
Diamonds shining sipping on Heinekens your mind was in a trance
Time to go take a chance to advance
Police, you want the killin' to cease, give us a million a piece
And we'll get off of the streets and build our house in the east
I know the answer is No!
So up until my death
I'm screamin', ""Fuck Bill Clinton and Bob Dole""
Look here
When I was young I didn't hardly know shit
Figured ballin' would get the mediocre nigga noticed
So I approach it like I was coached Griff using a gun
Game could be over come if you silence your tongue
My name ring as the chosen one threw out the slums
Since a embryo in my mother many pains I brung

Money on the Couch,Solja Rags,1997.0,"I went through with the plan, now the man sendin' me grams
My coke organization still infestin' the land
No joke, built my Mama an estate in the Bahamas
Crops of marijuana protected by Big Timers
Hand, full of ice, a gangsta's paradise
Expensive merchandise, I had to sacrifice for the glamourous life
Don P. for breakfast, Benz, stretches, and Lexus
Distribution of coke from Louisiana to Texas
Some fabricated, but fascinated by the way that I made it
Now my name is implicated with the greatest
Wearin' the latest, leather fatigues and B.B.H.,
Brand new Mercedes, parked in front of my new estate
Twelve o' clock we gave him, caviar, is what we ate
Party with killas, paraphrenalia full of projects
Dope snorters or prospects, the rob your shop necks
But I gets pissed, and send hits, don't fuck with my shit
Wig split, the heel, whoever he roll with
Admit it, you did it, tongue too tied to say somethin'
Nine's bustin', bringin' your platoon to destruction
Continue hustlin', givin' up nothin' where the dope at?
Crackers can get the bozack, because I'm pro Black
Banged up a foreigner, he wasn't holdin' up his side of his deal
Alien gotta be killed, sent to the coroner
I'm sure he would have gone before the judge
With somethin' concrete, to sink me, 'cause
He was holdin' a grudge, fuckin' over a thug
Told my bitch I want him dead
Bring me his head, fill him with lead
Heard what I said?  Don't betray me
I'll put you on the streets and make you weak
Put carats and stones up on fingers and teeth
And built you a home next to the beach
And luxury cars we creep
Here's the nine, I don't have time, make it discreet

Money on the couch, nigga
Gimme everything up in your house, nigga
Shut'cha mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Gimme everything up in your house, nigga
Shut'cha mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch shut'cha mouth, nigga

I know that my cousin Lil' Kerzaw
He sold up outta his backyard
And sold up shit, from the seventeen all the way up to the Ninth Ward
You know he rolls up in the caddy
It's about that time to go roasts and vogue
I'ma go on the passenger side, fuckin' with every last ho
Nigga Russ was up in that car shop
Ready to get all the seats fixed
Let me go scope me a kneefit, so I can go out to the Freaknik
Shit, I'm the lyrical genius
Drop down on your knees to the penis
The nigga be talkin' the shit about my family, but I never did seen it
I'm larger than large, if you came home with two heroin charges
And I still got somethin' stashed in the garages
Y'all is petty, it's gone take two to fill my stamina
When I pass the camera, flash, fuck the amateurs
Ya better be top notch, or I'ma cock my rhyme Glock
To wound ya, and paint your death with my autograph on your tumor

Money on the couch, nigga
Gimme everything up in your house, nigga
Shut'cha mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Gimme everything up in your house, nigga
Shut'cha mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch shut'cha mouth, nigga

I'm straight from the ghetto, the Mag then went to Forshey
Then I left that spot and I went to the T, where the triflin' hoes play
They comin' to me and, they blowin' that funky fire
I'm drinking a beer and, them blunts be gettin' me higher
Due to my clique I walked to the front door
Hope it ain't them po-po's
I looked through the blinds, it went through my mind
""What I have to run for?""
Nobody would want to test me
Especially comin' to arrest me
Old body and soul, it's a must I leave you cold
Keep it chilly chilly, when I'm jigglin' jigglin' money
Some niggas say okay, but you can say no way
I'm drinkin' for honey
If I wouldn't be kickin' these rhymes so funky
You and your crew would never have bought my shit like junkies
A part of a ""ki"" is all that I need
To get on my feet, up outta the weed
The capital ""C"", I do it for weed, and even a ""G"" for slangin' them kis
I'm puttin' in it your face, Juvenile lookin' for a bitch now
Don't have no time for no foreplay, I'm simply gonna lay this dick down
Niggas be comin' with dope lines
Gimme the chance I'ma flow mine
I'm tearin' this bitch up in no time
No fuckin' ya up 'cause you know I'm
Funky like a club that's filled up with fat men fartin'
And never a bad thought in my mind, 'cause I'm steadily plottin'

Money on the couch, nigga
Gimme everything up in your house, nigga
Shut'cha mouth, nigga
Put the money on the couch, nigga
Gimme everything up in your house, nigga
Shut'cha mouth, nigga

You better protect your head, fuck the chest nigga

Of birds or chickens or ki's or bricks, whatever

Need them, birdies? You should see Weezy

Kidnap mothers, rape with no rubbers
What the, hell? What is that I smell?
No it's not but it's a dead body by the canal
My grill, platinum; necklace, platinum
Rolex, platinum; Hot Boy, ask him
Blunts, we pass 'em; guns, we have 'em
We do not flash 'em unless we gon' blast 'em
My clothes, Rees, Tees, Girbauds
Fo'-fo's, semi-automatic calicos
Brrrrrrr! Reload - *tch-chk* explode
Let it be told, I'm from Holly Grove, what?

Look.. look, look
Plenty of diamonds in my Rolex
Two karats on my finger, ten around my fuckin neck
It's a must everyday that I keep my pockets fat
Got so many haters that's why I stay strapped on my gat
I bust back back leave yo' bitch ass flat
Trust that if you play with me I dress in black
That's a fact don't make me click up with Karen and Brad-Brad(?)
You head your lose that, ain't no comin back back, I'm tellin you
Play with me your people people gon' be smellin you
Make me pop and throw, six niggas gon' carry you
People don't have no money they can't bury you
Don't have no insurance you be in the freezer a week or two

Niggas steady getting chopped
Losin they life behind stupid shit
Ain't that a bitch
Niggas, gettin' they wig split
And it's a shame
Killin' has became a fame
I cannot see my brains layin
On the ground
I keep my 9 on my waistline
Chop 'em down
Picks up the shells could leave no evidence around
And, it's t-shirt land
When niggas ain't playin'
Got a chrome Glock got it cocked
Red dot on yo' knot
As I pop
Nonstop
'Til you drop
Pronounced dead
On the spot
It's a tragedy when I spin' yo fuckin' block
A nigga, from BlackConnect
Will leave ya wet
Fa' sho yo' face is on the next
If ya disrespect
I ain't fakin' it, yo' life I'm takin' it
Hollow points bullets racin' it
Niggas ain't makin' it
When I bust
Tell it to any nigga chopper bullets you can't trust
If you bust, when I spray
Head for shelter
10% is gonna help ya, 90 is gonna fail ya
A lot of punk niggas try to play hard
Put yo' face on a fresh tee sendin' that ass to the morgue
Better be cool if you don't, that's all on you

16 worth a mill my whole clique push dope
Transportin' ki's in the all black Camero
50 G's on the seat, layin' next to my heat
I'm a Hot Boy to the police
And I'm a thug on the street
Yeah I score from Slim and B
10 a ki, real OG's, 36 oz's formed the halves
Goin' for 2 G's
UPT connect, bout stackin', leave ya wet
Niggas who disrespect, my chopper put in check
Big body on broaders, that's all I know
Mansion on Washetona 6 figures on the floor
Double R and DR watched by Uptown security guards
10 G's a ki, 36 o's a piece
4 and a half, 2 G's, but I'll take 18
Got some niggas on my team bout head bussin' and green
Flippin'  G's, hoopties, to benzies
I get my ki's, from my uncle KC
He's a Magnolia soldier
Be in 10 in Angola
Shootout in that 'Nolia
Knock ya head off ya shoulders

I ain't about no playin'
When I'm comin' get out the way
Gun play, bussin' a nigga ass on the runway
Head straight back to the hot block
Flight in a half
If I'm out there bad I might cut you in half
UTP tatooed it, across my stomach stay booted
Look I'm a looter, holdin' the Ruger
Or a 6 shooter
On Tuesdays and Thursdays
You better watch for the sweep
Look them people gon' act a ass if you get caught in the street
I'm layin' off in some room by my bitch duckin' them people
Staked out the area, and rob the Chinese store
Do it like it's legal, I heard heads in power
Bitches want the dope dick children and cop blockers
Niggas in the cut with ski masks lookin' for me
I'm on top of the roof with a chopper watchin' em too
Fuck with me your mans urge get in his curtains
Now send ya people
To the TC and we gon' hurt 'em
I'm seein' niggas
Shootin like that heavy on 'bauds and tens
I'm in the Chevy with B.G. and our girlfriends
Park 'round the corner leave ya gun and creep slow
Look bitch this ain't the night show, lay it down ho
Ya think I'm playin', ask Baby and Slim how I can
Hook me up I don't have time for no games
Look here I stompin' in this bitch
I'm chompin' a new fit
I'm bound to snatch a ho and make her monkey on this dick
Look at what ya facin' partner
A whole nation
Of niggas that's mind damaged
Out here paper chasin'
With that iron I'ma roll wit em
Mama don't pray for me I don't back down from no nigga
They got a place for me

See I want millions, hundreds and big thousands
Tryin' to rain clout and third ward public housin'
Uptown streets is where all my ends meet
Give me 9 9 G tryin' to see my destiny
I do it all to ball drop the phone if I call
See I'm livin' real large even though I'm real small
But don't let that fool ya
Money rules everything around me
Creepin up silent behind ya that's where ya find me
I ain't hear for a lil
I want the whole damn spot
I cock my Glock and have ya plot so I turn out to the top
Nigga be runnin' with money
Things you doin', I done done it
9 9 point 5 mil big deals keep it comin'
Slugs hummin' chopper gunning catch the vapor from the laser
Infrared fled big bread money maker
Pop a slug barrel shaker for big paper
Big ballin' life taker for big caker
Ben Franklin, bank televancin' big bankin'
Bust 'em gankin', left stankin' ship sankin'
Ain't no such thing like see another nigga come up
But if I don't know that other nigga, then his come up is my stuff
Call it a bluff if you want, but come and test for ya own
See how quick model homes leave home and 
Roam to the top, slip up and get buck
Get out my way, fo' I spray
I'm tryin' to live up

Young thugger, baby gangsta
Thug or get popped
Off top
Aim my pistol straight for headshots
I release the safety, if ya chase me
Best waste me
Don't hunt bitch down in ya way
Or ya make me
Reverse the game and wax that ass
Stop you from playin'
I clear yo block on that ass
Nigga wonder why I stress
Uptowns the place
It's the best
We got weapons that'll go through ya vest
Get left wet
Disrespect it's beef fo sho
Got back up, from the Mac Melph Calio
You got coke, and don't wanna go broke
VL it
'Cause around me bitch I'm doin' bad ya can't sell it

If you got change on ya wig

Real fast and quick

If ya ball you fall
If I jack you I don't want half I want all
Stand tall for mine
Nuts hang I'm real
My skills outstandin'
Kill or be killed
Niggas out to give me the blues
Let 'em kill me, I refuse
I'm down for killing
But the one of  I was accused
I leave ya funky

Da Magnolia,Tha G-Code,1999.0,"(Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)

Welcome to tha section where it's hotter than a bitch
Niggas breakin' up bricks, niggas tryin' ta be rich
Dope house get hit, on 'rilla & 6th
Somebody wig get split...for ten G's of chips
It's where the Feds'll dip through - enemies get you
Catch you at tha second line, niggas'll flip you
Kids get outta school, they swingin' they fists, too
Jump one of them children and they bringin' they clique, too
L.D. buckin' cause T.C. killin' ain't nothin'
Tha blues try ta hit ya and you had to keep druggin'
On New Year's, tha lights get shut out at six o'clock
Four or five o'clock in tha mornin' you gon' be gettin' shot!
Niggas gettin' chopped, gettin' shot in tha crowd, bruh
Drug deal gone bad, one of them cats was sour
Motherfuckers gettin' chopped up, every hour..
...Carbine aimed at your dome...for some powder
I'ma do like yella boy and hop in tha Eddie Bauer
Get off seventeen, and, nigga, I'ma holla!

Whole nickel tucked in tha back of his 'Baud cuffs
Well aware on the route that he's gonna duck...
...if somebody thinkin' 'bout jammin' him up
If a bitch with him, she better be smart, or tough luck
Cause he gon' break and bust; she gon' be fucked up
Mind your business is a code, too, I never told...
...ever since a nigga was a minute years old
Bein' a ballin' shot caller...is tha goal
I'll hospitalize anybody...in the roll
To make it there, you talk crazy, we take it there
You'll feel like a steak, nigga: you medium-rare
All these niggas wan' be tip-rats or tha man in charge
With tha AK-47, it'll change you boys

Something Got 2 Shake,Tha G-Code,1999.0,"I put my trust in myself and my 9 first
Y'all niggas second, third, and fourth because I'm first
Can't you tell I never had nothin'
Down to my last 5 dollars, ready to snatch somethin'
If them people catch me I'm goin' to jail fo' sho'
My old lady ain't gon' be sendin' me no mail no mo'
While I be askin' my lawyers, ""When they gon' let me go?""
He be tellin' me, ""Just be cool until you go to court""
Get out, back to the bricks, it's the same old shit
Niggas got 2.50 a piece goin' half on a nick
Back and forth to keys, but the Lil Weezy handle purchase
Popeye's for the ballers, the ghetto eatin' Church's
Shop always open cause nobody never closes
Some of 'em like that needle, some play with they noses
I ain't nothin' like a candlelight dinner, wine and roses
Niggas tryin' to run through they packets to get some mo' shit

Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga
Run with all the real niggas
Jack all of the fake niggas
Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga

My hallways full of piss
Nigga say he gon' break me off, he full of shit
That's why I got that chopper in the back full of clips
About to go and hit a whole stash full of bricks
All my niggas gone, I'm the last in the click
I gotta get my hands on some cash and a whip
I gotta do somethin', look
Cause this ain't gonna last long, gotta get my cash on
Come upon a superfire lick and get my ass home
Ain't thinkin' about jumpin' out Lex's and Benzes
With the TV's, and the CD's, and 20 inch 'renzes
Look here, my situation ain't the best in the world
I'm a snake like the rest of you niggas, full of that Guerl
Wodie, c'mon and get your skull cracked, tryin' to erase me
I got iron ready to warbat, and it's all for safety
Muthafucka might come, but he better come correct
Cause I ain't aimin' at nothin' else but you' head and yo' chest

Somethin' gotta shke nigga
I'ma bake a cake nigga

Jack all of the fake niggas

Put a hit on a bitch, ain't got no time for no bullshit
Nigga outta line, we kill'd the bitch
Now, in my city, they burn, baby burn
4 found dead, and they burn, baby burn
I don't have no question, we all must learn
To tote a .45, keep your eyes on the churn
I got that work nigga, all y'all know the rules
I don't play, I'm a mastermind, it's a Big Tymer, fool
Pay up when you been fronted work, that's the rule
Rolls parked, I play this game with no law
Red Beam, hot ones pointed straight to your jaw
A nigga must pay, I'm tryin' to see a better day
Went to Miami bought that Azora anyway
Three time loser totin' tools, nigga that's the rules
Just the chance I gotta take on these streets fool
Flippin' chickens, corner spitin', hardtimes a fool

Why Not,Reality Check,2006,"You can find me in the parking lot
By the car a lot-where we spark a lot
Up in the hallway it be dark a lot
We don't talk to cops cause we all be hot
Homey you need to get you somethin new (why not)
Shit I'm ridin somethin green, somethin blue (why not)
They gon' respect it when a gangsta come through (why not)
They doin numbers, we'll do somethin too (why not)

Is you doin ya dirt, they really know ya bout ya work
If it's over ya turf you goin out there head first
Do you know the rules when you got beef with a fool
Can you stick and move and do you sleep with the tool
You in the camp you bout to make you an examp
So when they see the stamp they gon'respect it like a champ
You light in the ass but kind of heavy with the cash
Be rollin the grass you still totin the solider rag
You been out there on the grind spendin most of ya time
In a section full of nobody's so you gotta shine
Will you bust a head, know how to do it-how to play it
Bet a hundred in the field and parlay
Can you flip a Z, go back and get a Quater ki
When you rid of that call Rico up and order three
Put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
If you wanna be respected as the G'est

Homey you need to get you somethin new (why not)
Shit I'm ridin somethin green, somethin blue (why not)
They gon' respect it when a gangsta come through (why not)
They doin numbers, we'll do somethin too (why not)
You can find me in the parking lot
By the car a lot-where we spark a lot
Up in the hallway it be dark a lot
We don't talk to cops cause we all be hot

You like steaks with pretty hoes in ya face
You hate Jake's, you just come home on a case
Can you make a name-will you be patient in the game
Can you state ya claim, and reputation stay the same
Will you hold it down when ya lil'homies ain't around
Will you hold ya ground like you the only one in town
Is you feelin this, you listen to it when you creep
You real in the streets all in the hood with the heat
You ain't tryna joke gotta be real for ya folks
Is ya people broke they aggravate you on the porch
Do you sell weed and you don't never make a profit
Do you blow big until it hurt you in ya pocket
Is you scared to lose is you a winner all the time
You gotta lot to prove lil'sinner on the grind
Put ya people in it cause that's the way you gotta see it
If you wanna be respected as the G'est


Do you cheese up when it's a dime in ya grill
Do you freeze up when it's that time for a kill
If they pop at you is you gon'pop back at 'em
You gon'stay away from niggas if they rattin
Wanna ride swoll pull up on 24 flats
Can you get a ho without you throwin her a stack
Is you callin shots can you stay away from the cops
You know how to stop you be inside when it's hot
You from the East, you from the West, you from the South
You from the North, or the Midwest what you about
Can you twist a gar without you fuckin up the roll
Did you get a car just to be stuntin for the hoes
You been out here and it's ya time for a lick
Do you know this year is you aknowledgin the shit

Take Them 5,Tha G-Code,1999.0,"I hate to be doin' 5 but 10 even worse
I'ma take it before the district attorney strike worse
Beside he know what I did and they got evidence
And I'm not about to play with them people intelligence
Muthafuckaz try to stay, peep me at my residence
Chargin' me for homicide, they say it was negligent
Fuck it, I'ma accept my lick when it come to me
Now let me see how many of these bitches gon' run for me
Shit, my breath funky with a migraine headache
Big pissed off cause I know I made a mistake
But that's what I get fuckin' with pussy ass niggas
And 2 dollar hoes that'll trade you for cash figures
They did that. but I got a way to get 'em back
Not with the police though Juve ain't no rat
Nigga tell me shit I done fallen for the end
And you woulda had that dick look when you'd caught that 10

You gon' take 'em (Five)
Are you gon' take that shit to trial
And gon' be denied
Violate probation when you just got caught, with that ride
That alibi ain't gon' work
Ain't it some hotter niggas from out that 3 be doin' that dirt
You gon' take 'em (Five)
Are you gon' take that shit to trial
And gon' be denied
Violate probation when you just got caught, with that ride
That alibi ain't gon' work
Ain't it some hotter niggas from out that 3 be doin' that dirt

All the money in the world can't even move you
Your lawyers tryin' to fuck you, the judge tryin' to lose you
The district attorney don't give a fuck about y'all
Cause he gotta run run for office again in the fall
So everything he cross-examine he tryin' to fuck over
Grudges on his shoulder, tryin' to read his quota
You wastin' ya time boy when you wastin' they time
Cause they'll start off with a nickel and try and give you a dime
You think I'm lyin', go ask my cousin KC
You think I'm lyin', go ask my cousin Ducky
Both of my niggas just cam home from doin' a bit
Both of my niggas know what incarceration is
Lil Daddy, you fightin' a war you can't win
You're guilty as charged soon as them people stand up in
So accept ya lick, you got caught with more than a brick
And you ain't gon see the streets 'til two-thousand and six

You gon' take 'em (Five)
Are you gon' take that shit to trial
And gon' be denied
Violate probation when you just got caught, with that ride
That alibi ain't gon' work

That alibi ain't gon' work
Ain't it some hotter niggas from out that 3 be doin' that dirt

It's sharks out here boy, niggas be rattin'
You be up in penitentiary and don't know what happened
Law, you're tellin' me you're wanted for murder and kidnappin'
Short on they information so they lyin' and scrappin'
You don't want to be in jail that ain't you're place
When your child graduate you gon' look her in the face
Tell her lil wodie out there hustlin' somewhere across the nation
All in the projects, take that probation
Believe it or not, you be up in the cell block
Far away from home where you can't even sell rocks
Bitches ain't on your side like up in the bricks
Cause once you up in the jailhouse they searchin' for that dick
Sco' no, cho' no, I'm single
My man up in jail, I can still mingle
I'm my own woman, fuck who, what, or when
My man can't whip me, cause he doin' ten

I know ya feelin me behind them penitentiary walls
Put me on the visit list and I'll be in to see y'all
Talk to 'em - your mayor ain't your friend, he's the enemy
Just to get your vote, a saint is what he pretend to be
Fuck him! Ah-listen to me, I got the remedy
Save your money up and find out who got 'em for 10 a ki'
Bubble, if you don't hustle don't use your energy
Cause you gon' be a cellmate or wind up as a memory
Yeah, and I could give a fuck if you kin to me

Ever since they tried to drown a nigga on the East Bank
Everybody need a check from FEMA
So he can go and sco' him some co-ca-llina
Get money! And I ain't gotta ball in the Beemer
Man I'm tryin to live, I lost it all in Katrina (damn)
And nobody cares what the police thank
Everybody fuckin with ki's cause it's a street thang

Just them crackers behind them desk-es that ain't hearin us though
We starvin! We livin like Haiti without no government

My Money Don’t Fold,Cocky & Confident,2009,"(feat. T Money & Kango Slim)

What?!
Flight School in the building homey
Nino, it's on as a bone mayne
Gettin that money mayne
Puttin it in the bank account though, writin checks
If you broke man it's gon' be hard for you understand this
But peep this

I know you see the cars, the jewels and the clothes
Bitch nigga my money don't fold
Bitch nigga my money don't fold
Bitch nigga my money don't fold
I know you see the Lamb' with the butterfly do's
And I keep it to the side on some hoes
Bitch nigga my money don't fold
Bitch nigga my money don't fold

Oh no! My money don't fold... I'm a winner
If money is the root of all evil, I'm a sinner
Listen up soldier boy I bend your antenna
Red dot on the center of your head for my dinner
I don't talk about swag... cause I show it
50 thousand dollar cash every 12 I blow it
Yeah that boy hot, Lambo's in the lot
What'cha know about deep sea fishin on a yacht?
Lil' kids thankin showtime at the center
Retarded baby it's me because I'm shittin like an enema
You garbage, I'm solid
I'm on these hoes like fingernail polish
Fresh out of Flight School I got it on pilot
You in the corner actin stupid lookin childish
You got your shades on loc but you can notice me
You actin like you don't see me but bitch I know...


Every day I'm the man... I pop Louis tags
I probably got your whole life inside this Louis bag
You know the F1, I already wrecked one
Had to upscale, Lamborghini was the next one
Hold your tongue son, I be on that BS
I put that on everything I am U.T. yes
I was in them raids, now a nigga paid
And my bitch sippin more of these champagne heads
Yes, I'm everywhere that they ain't broke
Seen the money then I'm already at the airport
I am a star boy, you look a fan like
You coulda bought two but you ain't have your plan right
I got my Louis' on, cool plus iron white
Sunday might go out there and show 'em I'm the man like
You got your shades on loc but you can notice me
You actin like you don't see me but bitch I know...


I said I just got paaaaaaaid! The money playin ping pong
I'm ballin at the red light, feelin good like King Kong
This here the theme song, hundred fifty steam on
I'm dead wrong, talkin money on the phone
It's baller music, baby buy you some
Boy I'ma get paid no matter how you come
You can't act crazy, I'ma go and get guns
I tell you what, be the quick to show up punks
I hit the highways boy, with CDs and tapes
Might come back with X pills, and cell phones and Bapes
State to state, boy we tryin to be straight
Fuck that, we tryin to bake a wedding cake
They just got the new Jag, God damn that's fun
Well we just got the paper, God damn that's one
Because my money don't fold, spend my money on hoes
We about it hoe so go and get some mo' dough",https://genius.com/Juvenile-my-money-dont-fold-lyrics
U Don’t Wanna,J Prince Presents Realest Ni@@as Down South,UnKnown,"What's up Playboy?
You know how we do this, Hot Boy$ and Big Tymers
Two rolex on our wrist
And every car we ride in got TV's I know you love this here

You can call me the Baby Don of the 'jects
You can call me what you what, but you call me collect
You can call me the muthafucka cuz that's just what I am
When you call for the policeman, call for the ambulance
Lildaddy we got'cha swooped, ha?
You got that iron but you too paranoid to shoot, ha?
You think you cute, ha?
Stuntin' Lildaddy will get'cha broke off
Automatic weapon up to your throat fall
Your witness won't survive to make it to court Dogg
Envision I'm still alive I play the sport y'all
You can't run the block without me interferin'
You can't open shop without my niggas hearin'
All the time, it be on my mind
U.T.P. I represent until the day I resign
Put my three fingers up and show my Solja sign
Let these muthafuckas know they clique ain't older than mine

Nigga it's that U.P.T., where we be all the time
You find big bodies and dead bodies all the time
Nigga I SWEAR, you don't wanna go there

And you ever seen that many niggas in blacker trucks
Nigga just run stop act and duck
Like in my K mane, it spray anyday mane
I make way mane, that solja can't play Wayne
Them say pimpin' ain't easy, but it gotta be done
But headbustin' ain't cool, but they gotta be bust
But wait, please don't debate, on what we would do
Cuz I don't even be wantin' to do what we would do
But, I swear it be them trees dogg
It make me ride in all black clothes with solja rees dogg
Please dogg, don't come test CMB dogg
Cuz we all, burn ya block and will just flee all, I'm tellin' you
Don't spark up no problems 'fore your people be smellin' you

Dippin' niggas like tokens no jokin' brains gone hang
Gotta get it how they live, how they live better get it
Shit you kill or get killed
It's an army Uptown, niggas bout bustin' heads
You can't be no hoe, if you scared, say you scared
An untamed gorilla I ride anyday
Let a nigga spook me, he spray, then I'ma spray
I'm a violent type nigga, creep at night nigga
Fuck with me, a nigga lose his life type nigga
Fuckin' right nigga that's how we do it Uptown
Nigga'll dump your body where it can't be found
Still playin' it raw, shit never gone change

With my twelve gauge automatic knock a lil' nigga down
So won't you bring me to your house round?
And I don't want no yay
I want your rolex and the money and a new lac
So I could put your bitch, in my passenger sac
Label me a gold grill brown-skin Mac
And I'm hard up, rollin' with gorillas and killas
Tattooed and we hard up dope dealin'
And if I catch ya down bad I'ma rearrange ya head nigga
Cuz I'm a Big Tymer just won't stop

Now why would you come empty handed to a gun fight?
It's a slight chance that your ass just might, make it
To hear the record come out
What's wrong you can't talk with a barrel up in your muthafuckin' mouth?
See niggas don't fight no more, all they do is burst

Shawty, peep the way I do, how I'm livin'
You steadily trippin', say I'm trickin' with the women
Girl, don't make me start to flippin', everything is what I'm givin', I know

I know I'm comin' home to big fine after my day done
All concerned about how I'm feelin' and if I ate somethin'
You always hear the bullshit stories and never say nothin'
'Cause all of 'em in search for a man, that's why they stay sufferin'
Though you may think I'm from this bitch to the next
A nigga be outchea tryna get him a check, but I prefer cash
For me and you so don't even much get ya nerves bad
They want attention and they don't even deserve that
Girl, you miss Juvie, what you think I don't care?
What you think I'm 'bout to go sacrifice this shit for that there?
They wanna catch the biggest fish in the sea, but he ain't swimmin'
'Cause he satisfied and ain't lookin' forward to other women

I know, you know, I know, you know
Just 'cause they shakin', don't mean I'm takin'

Women try to tease me but I tell 'em ""Be easy
My family needs me so I'm goin' where my seeds be.""
I can sign ya poster but I cannot intercourse ya
They really want a solider, that's why they bendin' it over
Holla at big daddy, I'm comin' home like I 'ppose to
With a big ol' bag of groceries and somethin' that we can smoke up
We don't need a clashin', 'cause me and you is what's happenin'
They thought we wasn't adaptin', now everybody congratin'
Forget all of that yappin' long as we keep interactin'
And we keep on attractin' to each other with a passion

No matter how long I'm gone, I'm always comin' home to you

When the big dog is in ya they gon' wanna bother a G
Wanna leave away tonight and come back tomorrow with me
Yup so they can put a nigga business all in the streets
Out here tellin' folks she gotta problem recordin' for keeps
She got big Randy Johnson, tryna get me to the plate
Hopin' I recognize her curve but I can't even relate
Now they be at the red light, flashin' me with they head lights
I know how to play it like, tell 'em to get they head right
I'm not tryin' to touch her so you can keep ya lil rubber
You too young for me, why ya tryna get me in trouble?
She know that I love her, look we was meant for each other
And she gon' act a fool when she with me under the cover

I got a gold two thousand Jag, and customized Cadillac
(I got some shit with 17's on the front, and 20's on the back)
My mom in a mansion, and my dad in a truck
(Player my sister in a 2001 tinted and rimmed up)
I take care of my baby mommas like we still together
(When my brother get out of jail man I'mma buy him whatever)
Credit in my yellow gold in exchange for white
(Y'all saw me at the Source Awards, wasn't that shit like tight?)
Cartier frames with wood grain on the ear
(V.S.O.P. Hennessy, so save y'all fuckin beers)
A diehard nigga, a 3rd Ward nigga
(7th Ward hardhead ready for war nigga)
A Cash Money clown, tattooed and scarred nigga
(I ain't bitchin up for nar' one of y'all funky ass niggas)
Princess cuts, baguettes and marquises - what that say?
(Bad motherfuckin baguettes in Chinese)

Sunshine - in the middle of the night
Sunshine - with baguettes so bright
Sunshine - every place that I be
Sunshine - all of ya bwoys know me
 We be holdin the Cristal high so you can see
The princess cutted Presidential Roley
 Sho' Lil, won'tcha scratch the Rover, with the block TV
(You lyin) Six in the headrest, all got new TV's
 Well look the other hand, holdin a blunt real high
So you can see the Wonder Woman bracelet sunshine
 2000, Navigation on 19 inches
My mom in the 6 I ain't out ya penny pincher
 God Bless Wayne, when I set foot on the scene
I make you take a triple take, at the bling, the bling bling (what?)
 Iced out sparklin millionaire on the flo'
Hittin these hoes with shit they never seen befo'
 Now when you see my neck, you could just say ooh
That Hot Boy from Cash Money's a fool
 In our platinum Benzes with the cat eyes (eyes)
Flat screens in my crib with the flat I's (I's)


Hold up - there go Wayne, everybody be quiet
Oh my God! He's drivin from the passenger's side
Million dollar conversation when I talk I'm shinin
Nigga I.. puh, puh - spit out diamonds
I change the grill on my truck so I don't blend with niggas
A young cat like me with Bill Clinton figures
I'mma expensive nigga, drive Bentleys nigga
(?) got it dropped on twenty inches nigga
Best type got navigation system nigga
VCR, PlayStation, televisions nigga
You know stuntin is a habit, chrome on the Navi
TV's in that rear headrest to entertain the traffic
They call me the hot man, got the block on lock man
All my cars chopped man, all my trucks drop man
Trunk full of knock man, wrist full of rocks man
Pants full of Glocks man, sunshine spot man

 Now you can catch me sunshinin on the lake on Sunday
What's happenin Fresh?
 Don't fight, Sunny Delight - it's beautiful
 Where, nigga, where you, where you be sunshinin at?

And Suga Slim on his left arm, whatchu think about that Geezy?

Make a better place for my kids right now
Or get out my face is how it is right now
All I wanna have is my own shit right now..
So much go through my head all day
The game situation is be paid or played
I gotta eat the lottery is not for me it's homicide and robbery
And a twenty room mansion, buck-naked with a lot of freaks
It ain't cool if my people don't eat they part of the reason
I got away from all that bullshit, that thuggin and thievin
And as far as this Cash Money shit it's part of my blood
And we feed each other everyday by showin 'em love
It don't matter what we came into we gonna stay blood
And whoever sleepin on it dem dat's gonna wake up
I need dough to feed me and my people
To get a pie and eat special from, Julio's
Fuck ya boy, I don't care, who he know
Just make sho', that he pay, who he owe
I ain't tryin to be a bully I just want what I earned
He's a hardheaded child and it's time to be learned

You don't like me, yeah? Well fuck you in ya ass
Niggas is pure pussy and they made me mad
You don't like me, yeah? Well fuck you in ya ass
Niggas is pure pussy and they made me mad

I've seen shit that a child my age, shouldn'ta saw
They bustin right over the backseat of a stolen car
I was seven they had to be about nine or ten
His momma Fay she done ran through who's dyin again
Damn but I don't really think she mean what she say
As soon as she smoke that crack, shit done fucked with her head
Momma gon' love her kids, any place, anywhere
And if momma don't love her children, then momma need prayer
Durin the struggles of my life I learned to take heed to shit
I paid attention to everything that went on in the bricks
All of the early morning rushes to the late night fights
I always visioned that one day this would be my life
Back then it wasn't gravy, the street wasn't right
Especially in our house, we didn't eat some nights
On come new technology these days and times
And it gave us other avenues and ways to grind
Fuck what you got nigga, I'm makin mine
I messed up my first lil change, I'mma be straight this time
To the fullest, always huntin, for it to spend
I went out and got it dawg, I can do it again


Get off the block lil nigga this my spot lil nigga
I don't care what you got you get shot lil nigga
I been thuggin, and I'm lovin my life
The reason I made it to here because I been livin trife
For spite stoppin knockin old niggas off
Tryin to be the fuckin boss and shotcall
Ride round in the toughest cars, double R's
Fuckin over niggas don't want see me ball
Now which one of your peers wanna come do this
I ain't with all of that talkin cause my gun do flip
Lift niggas off they feet when they run they lip
Tryin to tell you bout people, tell you that chick's on chips
You don't like me, yeah? Well fuck you in ya ass
Niggas is pure pussy and they made me mad
I'm straight off of the street that's why I'm out chea bad

If you got a spot movin sellin bricks I can feel it
Done mapped it all out, done made some phone calls
We all got big dreams of seein the project ball
After all, seperation is the downfall
Instead of a chain of command niggas wanna shot call
That overnight money could be lose-your-life money
Everybody want the crooked instead of the right money
And then I ain't no better either, cause I lead a
Life of crime if I gotta fight for mine
Look - somebody ain't leavin with a stripe this time
Y'all don't want a drunk nigga gettin hype with nines
My ex-girl done told me I can't see my children
I hope nobody play with me cause I might kill them
Shit, motherfuckers ain't never satisfied

But you can find me in my ghetto nigga, totin a fo'-fo'
I'm real with this shit nigga we dash on five-oh
A big dice game nigga fuck them five-oh's
I keep the same game nigga crack a guerilla ho
I play the same thangs but my prices get cheaper though
I pull up in the Range Rover twenty inch mo-mo's
I been through hard times, that nobody know
Slang dimes crack times you could believe that wo'
Comin through in the Bentley V-12 y'know
Ten a ki is the price and we don't love no hoes
Water whip playin games slangin bad ya-yo

Ain't no encyclopedia could teach me the hood
How to not give out no credit and distribute the goods
How police gon' hound me, investigate 'round me
Catch me with a firearm them bitches gon' down me
And I'm beefin with the biggest nigga in the city with work
Ain't no tellin who he got workin for him in blue shirts
If I hurt, then you hurt, you got work? I take yours
I gotta records durin the season like the Lakers
It's not for fun I got a gun you try to run I'm poppin one
I'm to' up from the flo' up, just look at what the block done done
I can't sleep - cause I'm too far in it
I took over this motherfucker cause I knew y'all finished

If you do what you do, do it well
KnowhatI'msayin? I ain't playa hatin I'm congratulatin
I'm tryin to teach you niggas how to get offa these streets
And how to accumulate money, so you can be successful
Like the rest of these niggas that are out chea, that's on TV
These niggas on MTV, BET, The Box and what have we

Juve wild magnolia
Its an uptown thing
Soulja watchin' over me
So I'ma let it rain
Just give me the weed, the mic
And I'ma let it off the chain
Y'all actin' like, that nigga lost it
I ain't have no money
Now I'm back, what the cost is
(?) on my wrist lookin' gooey
These ain't Birdman's
These is real Gucci's
Turn around the corner
Motherfucker tryin' to sue me
Talkin' shit to me so I can hit him with a two-piece
Where he rock, where he roll
Where he got control
Me and my mans and them get the brains out these hoes
If she can dance, then she can romance nice and slow
Be in a trance like it was your man's pipe in the hole
I've been sippin' a little somethin'
Just stop servin' the game
It feel good to be an OG
I'm deservin' it mayne

Now ain't no tellin' where I might be (Nope!)
Cause there's a million other creeps
Prancin' around these streets lookin' like me
Call them my stunt doubles
So if you think you hit Luda' with the rueger
I'm up in Cuba blowin' blunt bubbles
On the double, lookin' for trouble we staarted
The eye on my gat is cocked its retaarted
I'm sippin' lean, smokin' green, and I'm so hot
I told machine's people call me +I Robot+
Bang to the boogey boogey bang bang
Let my little partner borrow my necklace
And hit bitches with the same chain
Its not computer love (Nope!)
I'm gettin' great brain
Got a hard drive
But they blow me out my mainframe
Now how you like that?
I got your momma pitchin' quarters
On the corner gettin' cornered
And come right back
I'm makin' tight stacks (Yeah!)
So if it ain't Juve or Luda
Then can it nigga, we don't even like rap!



Got the Mack in the grass
And the nine in the dumpster
Duck when they pass
One time wanna dump ya'
Hunger
What I got in my veins
Take shots from the Henny
Just to straighten my aim
Now, I raise my middle finger (Fuck the World!)
And them donuts in that car better make ya' hurl
Yea, I'm bout my paper mayne
I'm fully loaded like them niggas in Jamaica mayne
I know you know
This is Crack
And he's back
And you mad
Cause we diiid

She want some big bills

Who the fuck - nigga hittin shots in the truck
Hope I'm able to make this right turn, my Neon fucked
The wodie that I'm with, bawlin up like a bitch
Instead of tryin to retaliate by bustin his shit
My leg already fucked up, been playin it bald
Now I gotta drive the car too, funny and all
Left arm on the steerin wheel, right on the Mac
Them niggas brought it to me raw so I'm bringin it back
Out the window with it dumb sinnin, but I crashed
This boy went straight through window his stupid ass
And I'm noticin I smell gas
Gotta bust a airbag, get out the car fast and haul ass
I still gotta duck bullets that cut through bricks
What the fuck I did to make niggas want do me like this
Won't be long 'fore one of the bullets ignite the gas
They'll meet - even the buildings gonna be ash

My life my life my life my life
My life my life my life my life
Ain't no sunshine 'til they gone
Ain't no sunshine 'til they gone

I'ma go on to survive but the story returns
After bein treated several months for 3rd degree burns
My lil cousin Denaun flipped out, and murdered his children
I gotta go by my aunt now, he hurtin her feelings
He's lookin at a L, swearin no need for a trial
Accept it like a man bitch or live in denial
Whatchu think the people gon' say, when they look at his file
Hear that little boy, snicker he in here for a while
I had a shit bag on me, I could barely walk
Everybody knew the story but was scared to talk
I read lips when I pull up, right after I park
I hear a nigga say whass happen wo' but not from the heart
Word gotta be out, a lot of tension's in the air black
Your everyday niggas ain't even muchly makin transac'
If I think about a gun, I'ma get ten
The people got they ears to the streets and they be listenin


Niggas be knowin them bitches slippin when I'm dishin
I'd rather be locked down in prison than come up missin
But that goes to show you how fast the laws work
They was peepin with somebody that punished them boys first
Don't they know the people still thinkin I sent the hit
I'd accept it if I did it but they wrong for that shit
To the police, I sounded like the boy cryin wolf
Cause they know I like slangin rice shootin dice with the crooks
Everythang in life I accumulated I took
It's a neverending episode, my life is a book
I'm hot, so I'm ridin round up in Rock(?)
There's a funeral pass, two cops and five limos
Man that's one of them niggas was tryin to snipe me
I betcha everybody in that crowd don't like me
I should go up in the bitch bustin
But they got innocent bystanders that never did the clique nothin

How you just gon' back me up and I'm 2 dollars from bein rich
You oughta be grateful a nigga like me even see you BITCH
I was thinkin about rockin Adidas, but the gators look nice
Nigga was talkin about they was comin out like players tonight
They won't let me in with my pistol I'm okay with the knife-a
Anything I can get my hands on when the fight starts
Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand, by the right bar
Get the wife and she could {?} {?} light stars
She ain't stupid, she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records, play the songs for the kids
For instance, I can come through bouncin in this bitch like what
And she's figured this shit, she ready to give that life up
Wonderin how do it feel to be with G's like us
Be in a better situation than that all night bus
You're wild ho be fuckin up my G's
You better get back, I spent six and a quarter for these, ya hear me?

They're not about the camouflage, the homies that I ride with
I keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
I don't vouch for nobody, I just make sure I pay homage
Hey shorty, this nigga here's a vet like Shaq
I don't have to control the ball but I control that rap
If I smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back

But I'm still blingin and showin off my toys in this bitch
When a real nigga show up hoes switch up they games
Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names
Claimin, she ain't nuttin like them boys be sayin
Shit I'm only tryin to knock the pussy outta the frame
Look here, I tried to chill but they gave me some mills
Me and Mannie back at it, 'bout to get another deal

Gangsta be bustin' heads
Lil Reggie be bustin' heads
K.C., he be bustin' heads
Think I ain't 'bout nustin' heads
Boddies bled, I'll put infrared up in your Cutlass
You play with 226, that's my clique so I say fuck it

With them hundred round tip-tips, to make sure niggas ain't breathin'
You recievin', a punishment for not believin'
Curly head lookin' for me, 'cause I'm hot and word don' got loose
Bundles of dope fronted, from the Magnolia to the Goose
Snitches wanted to testify the shit that they know
Set a bomb on the front door, put a key in the door and the place blow
Look I been walkin' way mo', with a coat full of yeh-yo
Nothin' but clientele, from 11-5, sale

The devil tryed to get wit me
To affect all of my dickin' inability
But it's gon' be some shit, when a collision is occurin'
Asurin', of me bein' a factor, through '97 and after
And I'ma have to, get my ten percent
Or I'ma get punished, like the rest of these niggas and there's evidence
'Cause ever since all these cars and all these mansions, and all these
Luxuries was givin'
You wasn't givin' no thanks, to the reason you was livin'
So I'mma keep an open mind and make the right decision
And ain't tell you niggas shit, and put my self in a position
That's unescapable, 'cause you capable, of puttin' my life in danger
And it's causin' confusion, confusion draw conclusion
And shootin' up some niggas that pose a threat

Everything I scratch and everything I ride

Have on your bulletproof sweater, ridin' in an armored Jetta
Beware of these, thugs in E's
Everytime you breathe you recievin' a part of me

Total control and all about self my way of thinkin'
Bankin', off top, runnin' with them boys from the block

It Ain’t Mines,Juve the Great,2003.0,"Now I don't why you be acting all shady
I only want to hit, not to make you my old lady
So don't be telling me nothing about no babies
You trying to give me a charge you must be crazy (2x)

I don't know why you making people think I got you swell
You better quit it before one of my bitches pop you hoe
I know your baby daddy he ain't got no flow
You may be into playing games but its gone stop here though
You want more than a fuck, you just trying to tie a nigga up
Like my last bitch, I blew a lot of money on her
I met her, fast pace, lil mama hard for me to slow down
Why the sad face after the results come around?
You want a nigga to play daddy? Should have asked me
I would have gladly told you that I have me
When you met me you told me you wanted a gangsta to hit
Without the wisdom of knowing I'm off the chain with this shit
Now your feelings done got involved and you ain't glad with a fuck
And you wonder why all the players keep on passing you up
Look Juve ain't going through that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone let you put your babies on me I mean this


You got a fat ass, your chest right, and you dress right
But would I fuck without a rubber? You're thinking I just might
Trying to get an easy pay off, you're fighting for a wild card bitch
But I'm in the playoffs, you be scheming all day, hoe take a day off
Find another target this one you need to stay off
Your looking for a reputation - I'ma give ya one
Don't be trying to give me a charge - nothing a nigga done
As far as I'm concerned that baby can be for anyone
Not til you entered the party there wasn't any fun
It's not me it's the attention I draw
To make these bitches fill out paper work and lie to the law
It's obvious she want to ride in the driver's seat of my car
Taking the lotteries to get some properties from a star
Look Juve ain't going for that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone late you put your babies on me I mean this


They be like look at his lips, look at her eyes and her ears
Mama said ""If I don't approve it, the baby not his""
She said she not gone keep all that (?) with kids
Keep playing mama said she saw 380 ya did
I saw the grin on your face the moment I saw you in court
Wish I would have saw your face when the test was exposed
This ain't your first time you done did before
Your not even gonna have a vagina no more
You're making accusations you ain't sure bout
You had a chance to be a queen but still you chose to whore out
Don't even speak you ain't no friend cause you an enemy now
Niggas knowing you ain't the hoe you pretend to me now
You done caught a maybe-baby, move you're whoring and drama
You needs to try to focus on your daughter lil mama
Look cause Juve ain't going for that old Billie Jean shit
I ain't gone let you put your babies on me I mean this",https://genius.com/Juvenile-it-aint-mines-lyrics

It's something in particular got you sayin' what you sayin'
Usin' my name in vain, hard for you to stay in your lane
That nigga fathered you, then manipulated your mind
And kept you out of the way so you would stay in the blind
But then you woke up, and realized he was takin' your shine
And you're mad at the whole world and they don't owe you a dime
Some of these niggas don't be gangstas when they 'sposed to be gangstas
You know he owe you money and you're scared of him, ain't ya?
You can never point the finger at me, playa you stayed
When I left I couldn't call you when my bills wasn't paid
Wasn't dependin' on nigga to send me shit my way
Wasn't really concerned about what a bitch might say
You coulda came and testified for my trial
But you had more love for Slim and Baby than you had for 'Nile
I didn't hate, I just moved on
Now that I'm doin' good I'm hearin' me on your new song and Juve wrong?

Where you in trouble if the police ever knock on your door
We from the ghetto so they find choppers and Glocks on the floor
I done had all type of shit thrown at me, learned from this and that G
After all that I done been through, why is this bitch so happy?
I'm alive and well, a true talent indeed
I'm God's gift to the earth, would be a shame if I leave
And I seriously don't be fuckin' with niggas with greed
And that goes for all you outsiders and family trees
I can see the specks runnin' they necks, he ain't all that
I don't even hear him to record that, I'm doin' me
We independent, ain't no middle man
Either get the business right or get the business in your brain
Play your hand

Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me
Say it to me now
Heard what you said about me

Haters steady hating, they runnin' they mouth
But really don't know a damn thing 'bout the game
And I'mma only tell you one time, I'm a millionaire
So that shit you niggas talkin', I ain't gon' entertain

""Forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
Lead us not into temptation
But deliver us from evil...""

Father, I ain't gon' let 'em get to me, they know my history

Get Your Hustle On,Project English,2001.0,"Fa sho' nigga, off top
Believe this playboy, fa sho' nigga

I'm the #1 stunna, don't flinch you bitch
I cash in quick and go and flash my 6
Twenty inch dub niggas how you love that bitch?
20 ki's or hard blocks, we call them bricks
I'm a Uptown survivor, niggas stash the lick
Just bought a new Beemer, X-5 the bitch
Puttin dubs with a kit nigga, flash yo' shit
Puttin ice in my grill, fuck a classy bitch
I'm a Uptown thug, can't you see that shit?
I'm around the way hunt for quarter ki's and bricks
You can catch me at the club with a ghetto bitch
Or you can see me at my mansion with a nasty bitch
Flat screen, loud music, me and Fresh a bitch
Pullin out the driveway with new cars and shit
Palm trees feelin good nigga we love this shit
Watchin ducks nigga bucks, but hold up bitch

Let me get my hustle on, nigga all for Nol'
Let me make a hundred mill', nigga slow but sho'
Let me spin my new wheels in front yo' do'
Let me hit the battlefield nigga slangin snow

I wonder why niggas always be doin stupid shit
No sense involved at all, it's foolishness
Now if a nigga take it and somebody hit yo' stash
Is you goin to bust his ass or are you gonna let that pass?
Besides, it only was a bundle of dough
You a hustler nigga, you know how to get you some mo'
Just tighten up yo' circle and surveillance your spot
If you catch a nigga touchin somethin, he gettin got
Now carry on with whatcha doin 'fore the people get hot
Leave them hoes alone cause they the reason we gettin got
If you owe a nigga pay him they be holdin a grudge
He don't want to take a loss but he'll take it in blood
Make sure fiends don't pass, make all the cash
Big fired bags and floss on they ass
I've been through some shit, that make me a survivalist
I may be a lot of different things, but I'm not a bitch


But anyway, I'm not the subject of the matter
All y'all bitch ass niggas I'm comin after
Cause the minute that I start slippin
Look at who is gon' be tryin to get in my position, niggas is grimin
But what they don't know, I got some killers that's behind me
I used to pull it off way back in the early 90's
If any one of y'all wanna do it we can do it
Don't hold it on your chest dog, don't be pumpin fluid

I'm a Uptown hunter on Washington 6th
Set the line goin down (?) a bitch
They got that iron Uptown and they slangin it quick
Valence is my home, I'mma rep 'til I'm gone
Valence and Magnolia, but Greyhead roam
Magnolia Projects is where I set my roam
Saratoga and Erato, I call my home
Ran through the Melpomene, nigga I did that shit

All the ballers is bouncin', they love the way I be leanin'
They love the way I be leanin', they love the way I be leanin'

This is the year of the U, watch how I get on track
Young black Peyton Manning of rap gettin his snaps
And also, he only rides in the year that he's in
'Cause he don't feel the year's bigger than him, so let the boy be
He off the meter with tennis shoes and a white tee
Bitches watchin' him thinkin', ""What if he wife me?""
And it's a certain kind of swagger you get
Especially when you're used to bein' the shit, that's if you're older right
All of my boss bitches know the type
When a nigga hug all on ya and he be smellin' like a motorbike
A nice fit and video on the TV'll
Get her to come out of them B.B.'s, believe me
I'm a thug and I'ma stay on pub'
And I don't hug, cause I carry the strap in the club
I see ya peepin' tryna figure out what's happenin' with us
They love the way I be leanin
, that's why they baggin' it up

Ice Age, Mike Jones!
You know that purple drank got me leanin'
My diamonds shinin' and gleamin'
I'm in that dropper with Juve
The groupies boppin' and fiendin'
I'm from the home of the candy paint
84s and purple drank
Ladies know when I hit they corner, my slabs'll make 'em faint
Ice Age and U.T.P., ball-ballin as you can see
Crawl-crawlin on 23s, with candy on my HumVee
Honeys love the way I talk, love the way I walk
Love the way I lean, they say that I'm so clean

I got a lot of money, I got a lot of ice
I got a lot of cars, many colors and lots of types
I got that paper 'cause I'm caked up like Betty Crocker
Comin' down on choppers single file with all the trunk poppers
Gettin money's my only task
Stack up paper and count cash
I'm ridin' on that pull over silver
The same color as a bad rash
Gettin' full of that puff puff pass
It's Paul Wall man what that do
Swishahouse baby that's my crew
Comin' down jammin' on the Screw

My rims be talkin' too, they love to seduce hoes
They're dressed in cute clothes, manicured with cute toes
I'm big paper Wacko, never stop for group hoes
Oh no, I don't scoop those, bad bitches salute those
Bad divas with benefits, you know I recruit those
This a Soulja Slim t-shirt, this ain't no suit ho
I got  up under these, not no Timberland boots, ho

I'm sick dog and there ain't no antidote

Kill me if you feel I ain't worthy
I inherited skills from murky niggas that's as real as my Saints jersey
I stand here posted in the worst of times
Knowing niggas after me, gonna rehearse my grind
I'm not a prophet, but I could teach you how to cock it and pop it
And how to put some money in your pocket

But watch it, niggas gone knock it
Trying to get you for your paper when them bitches is jockin'
You might do lil' daddy like that, but this is not him

You couldn't step on my toes if you was standing 6' 8""
It's mister 400 bitches so get that shit straight
You better talk to your ho 'fore I put dick in her face
Look, I'm wild Magnolia, she better get in her place
I ain't a law abiding citizen, I gets ignorant
I got a trail of niggas telling cops what I did to them
I ain't lookin for no poppers, ain't looking for no partners
I'm looking for mo' choppers to get rid of mo' problems
All I got is my ball and my words
My momma, my daddy, my chil'ren, my gun, and my herb
Shit, they got a lot of killers I know
But ain't too many gon' make it to see 2004, whoa!

I bet if I pull a pistol and pop you, you gon' tell me where its at
You see the blood shotted eyes with the taped up clips in the mac
Black hood with black gloves, bandanna round the mouth
A nigga posted up on every perimeter around your house
And we didn't come here for a meeting, or here to loose time
We some niggas who wanna be eating better in due time
Muther fuck leaving the block, better to use nines
It ain't no secret I'm cheap, however my jewels shines
The prisons got way  more  niggas than the streets do
Who average more than 30 murders a week (nigga we do)
It ain't a war thang, its a fuck me, fuck y'all thang
And we got hoes that know how to sneak guns in the bars man
So think twice about leaving the gun in the car man
Nigga don't give a fuck about moving son on the wall man
Ain't no everybody, its yourself and you all in
If you paying traps you don't deserve to be balling

Its enemy turf that I'm on
So I'ma play it how it go
Cock the hollow points into my black calico
I'ma make all these bitch niggas respect me right
Please let me hit another lick, I'ma be set for life

Look I'ma solid 170, lips like Bill Bellamy
Fresh out of the court house from whipping the felony
Didn't really want to hurt her, but you know how it is
You better not ever disrespect me hoe in front of my kids
Ayo the cops be rolling, therefore I fucks with no one
I went and copped me 4 guns, I'm bout to bust this open
To all you bitch niggas doubting the force, its gon' get ugly
I'm that nigga that'll fuck you up quick, thats why the streets love me
Catch me posted with Lil' Weezy, (?) I'm doing it
Niggas having problems with coke but we still moving it
Whatever's on the market I can work it
I ain't scared, I ain't nervous, give it to Juve dog and watch me serve it
You holding on the coke now whats the purpose, (?) gon hook it up too
Nigga the scheme is perfect, ya heared me
Now why is you acting like it ain't worth it
You gon' make me take it, nigga I gotta make it


Say nigga, heard a nigga picking (?)
Heard a nigga got all kinda shit ever since he hit that lick he
Don't want to fuck with a nigga, but look this what we gonna do man
I want you to go get your niggas and go find that muther fucker do him in
Ain't nuthing going on around this muther fucker if I ain't got my hands in it
I put a nigga on his feet and this how he gonna treat a nigga ?
I promise, I put this on my babies dawg, we gon get that motherfucker

They talking bout' putting a sting on me cuz they say I've been making too much
Fuck what they talking bout', this how I grew up
But this ain't nuthing new bruh, we been throwing this ""U"" up
We had some altercations and things but they got blew up
New has and Curly head them niggas dirty in the TC

Got my dick gettin' stiffer than a robot
You not lookin' concerned about what a hoe got
You just layin' it down right there in yo' spot
When you pass a nigga, come to a slow stop
Wonderin' how I'm lookin' when the clothes drop
Fresh out of the fingernail and toe shop
Lookin' real, I gotta get her when the hoe pop
She got a shape, ain't nothin' fake, she in the race
Her pretty face, I'd give her a 7 or 8
Or maybe 9 if she really fine
Side and behind with a lady mind
Diamonds, she genuine...

Let your hair down girl, you already know

Your big, fine, don't be scared, put your hands up
Give me a minute, you ain't gotta give your man up
In a relationship, I understand, and what?
He ain't focusin' right now, so we CAN fuck
Move - shake - bounce - pop
Pancake it, pull it over at the bus stop
Swing it back around, stop it there and make it wiggle
Put it in reverse and back it up just a little
It ain't your birthday, nope, it ain't your birthday
But I'ma treat you like that, if you can serve me

I bet a hundred that you gon' be up in first place

Tryin' to treat you like one of my family
And I won't be actin' like your man be
I'm the shit lil' mama, just chance me
Cause you're lookin' at a more advanced me
Now drop it, and pop it, and shake it like a dog
Look back at a gangsta when you're catchin' the wall

Let your hair down girl, you already know
(When I grab ya ass) I ain't gonna let it go
Ooh, I'm the shit and you the poo poo
Let a nigga fuck you with that uptown voo-doo

What’s Up Wit Dat,The Original Kings of Comedy (soundtrack),UnKnown,"Put a limit to tha bullshit and give me some space
Nigga recognize tha G in me when I'm tha place
I'll get mad and deliberately spit in yo face
I ain't no pretty boy nigga I'm a felony case
My daddy was slangin iron back in '78
Is you listenin to it nigga I'm I settin you straight
Tha next one of you niggas that come at me sideways
We'll be entertained wit 4 or 5 K's
Probably might get killed in 4 or 5 ways
Probably won't be found fo bout 4 or 5 days
Lil Wheezy in tha pen fo bout 4 or 5 days
Look he ain't in tha hood fo bout 4 or 5 days
Better not tell me shit when I'm upset
Cause I'll catch a flashback and all of y'all would get wet
Around tha way they call me Slap and Pop
Cause I'll slap a clip up in mac and let it pop

Look nigga if you pull that bitch, you betta shoot that bitch
Reppin fo them hoes that get their wigs split quick
If you abusin that shit, you probably shootin that shit
I'm Mr. Bling Bling nigga fuck that shit
You could find me in my Rover gettin head from a bitch
You could catch me on tha block breakin bread wit tha click
You could find me in tha lot buyin a matchin six
Lorenzo kit wit buttons on that bitch
I hit a pawn shop and buy a gat for tha click
Nigga ask tha Ruff Ryders
 if you real wit it slick
I took them to tha mansion that's paid out slick
Wit them Hummers, Bentleys and Jags and this bitch
I'm tha numba one wodie I don't talk no shit
Look at all this ice and how I'm poppin this shit
Nigga grease me up or I'll stick you up
Nigga put yo hands up befo I fuck you up
 (Hook Repeat 2x)
Now What's up wit dat
Cause you know us don't play
We bust tha gat
It got ice all over wit dubs to match
You catch us on yo block late dressed up in black
Now What's Up wit dat

It's like ruff, rugged, raw
Fuckin on tha interstate in a brand new car
Fo my niggas I'm ruff, rugged, wild
Strawberry kool-aid mixed wit Cristal

You deal wit me Lil Daddy I guarantee
That am......gone put yo ass on front of a white T
XXL choker neck playboy or V

Now I be creepin through tha back wit tha chrome plate in
Simmy auto, Tec let's get on baby
Now have they seen me in a seat Mer-cedes
Wit yo wife in a car wit yo babies
I'm a hot fire boy and I'm gonna let em burn
Straight from tha 17th point of no return
And I scerm thru traffic in a Porsche on factories
Hennessy in back of me
Now I'm feelin accurate
Ice blingin hard suddently the light captured it
Don't try me or yo moms die from a freak accident
OH NO! could it stop but I got this big ol' 4-4 (gun sound) pop
And I'm gonna chopped this whole ki into a lotta lumps

Don't stay up late I'm a be home when I'm finished
I gotta drop my people off at the airport in a minute
This is business; you ain't wit it then give me five feet

As long as I don't bring no diseases or no hoes back home
Let me roam - you won't even much need that phone
I'm a take care of my shit baby just leave that alone
I know when the pussy get wet and you need that bone
There ain't too many bitches out here that's gone be that strong
You was provided by your parents
Just knowing a gangsta was fucking they daughter was scaring em
I speak fat me and you bitch we got our life on track
And if I ever leave from you I'll be right back

""You ain't say that yesterday when I was blowing you!""
See that's what that mo and that dro will do
See drink up, smoke up come on I got some more for you
You like that? I got another joke for you
You grin, you in and I'm into poking you

You heard that but you ain't getting nothing from me
Except them three 20's that Slim had (Slim)
See I'm +Cut Throat+ in a Skip mask
Well then lose the number, you do me a favor
I ain't a lifeguard; I can't be your savior
You met me like this, I'ma be a player
So stop all the fussing and just beat me later

Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me
Throw up the U if your fuckin' with me

Come on Ma don't stress me
I was a gangsta when you met me
Knew I'd be where the pimps, the players, the hoes, and the tecs be
Where the dope, the coke, the dro, and the X be
New Kisha Keanne and Mil wanted to sex me
You still want to ex me or try to disrespect me
Now them hoes in your ear, got you trippin wanna test me
Look meet me on Freret Street right where my set be
Go home; pack all your shit and drop off them Vette keys
Anyway I'm tired of problems, you can catch yo cut
But first drop off the B.B.'s and the princess cuts
Round here stunting for them hoes - letting them gas you up
Now you stuck for them hoes - let 'em cash you up
I ain't gone lie is gone be hard for me to pass you up
But my plane fly straight, never crash for nothing
And before I fuck it up with a passenger
I'll get rid of you and snatch me an amateur

I'm ballin' in the game, boy, I need a pair or two
I'm walkin' on 'em in my slippers like a pair of Lugz
I'm not gone ever lead the way, that's what the preacher said
Like I'ma be on the corner at Morgan Freeman age
I'm in the streets making connections in them restaurants
I'm eatin' tacos and fajitas with the Mexicans

I wear my pride on my shoulders and my heart on my sleeves
In case I hold you ever see, I'm a part of the streets
Been a man support by nature since I started to breathe
Guns to be, I ain't got to take my talking with me
Fuck your whole block, bitch I'm from the West, so nigga what?
Mixed everything in my body, now pistol what?
You don't really want it with me, hope me fall back
Got a Louie V snuggage at the door, but I'll fall back
Anybody can get it, the sort that you don't care
For the slightest disrespect you gonna be wheat and load at
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Fall back, fall back, fall back, fall back
If a nigga disrespect me I'm a beat him all black
Bet you have those black masks, black boots in night
Wanna be in these four door
Murder game in the band, and there I handle my beat in solo
Yeah, I'm in with the robber davis, torture niggas in slow-mo'
Two two three is be like adenis, your mouth is where the mouse goes
Huss I'm leaving with beefing, you won't leave 'till your blood bleeds
I won't tell them to fall back, I tell them to fall deep
I'm right from them my freaks, they're going from all, hey
The one they fuck with, probably why they're all scared
Niggas know that I ate that one
If I pull a bullet, better get that gun
Drop full of heat, fresh up the fun
Ak set full of shit, done
It don't matter where you're from
My respect can get attached
Asshole, but nice, I'm k
Bitch, I'm a conduct the sun
I got more niggas than a millionaire money
The shit that hits you in July turn it to fall with your body parts
Why you niggas playing to me, searching for a hoit
I'm precastle but home is still, definition of perfect oil
You don't really want it with me, hope me fall back
Got a Louie V snuggage at the door, but I'll fall back
Anybody can get it, the sort that you don't care
For the slightest disrespect you gonna be wheat and load at

Juve ”The Great”,Juve the Great,2003,"Uh, Uh, Uh I took my first break in seventy-five
I tell the story like yesterday when(??) was alive
Didn't do shit with my brothers without makin e'm mad
Couldn't get along with nobody so I just ran with my Dad
He took me right there where the killas be
Across court from Mileton between Clarion and Wilistry
We shot ball on crates tryna get paid by all means
Started snatchin purses by Wall Greens
Seen Titey get hit up in the melt when I was young
Paramedics couldn't even find his tongue
Thats when I started totin' my heat to call a G
My family was deep but wasn't goin in that water with me
Right after Mr.Martin's class Juve would leaveand me
Straight to Farret think I was worried bout the trulency? please
Got paid for them old timers puttin in work
Like Mr. Frank he sold fruit, watermelons, and herbs

Even though the times was hard
I didn't fear no man but God
You lookin at New Orleans crime rate
Right up in the place, soulja's beware this is Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
This is Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
Juve the great
This is Juve the great

Mama thought her son was really doin it tight
When I was the one out here not doin it right
Until she found my stash she couldn't believe all the weed she found
Shit it must've been a half a pound
I was thirteen then back when Yoga was caddillac'n it
My campaign was let a lil nigga get a crack at it
Far from a gangsta but was learnin alot
Ain't just be the one that earnin the pot
After the turn of the clock I started bankin on the low with the dope
Got slugged up so hoes'll notice me mo'
Tee's, reeboks, and girbauds I had a few (??) to write
Regular hood shit the average niggas go through in life
Wanted to be a lil gorilla, and more day killas
(???) and we ball I know they'll flip ya
I stayed away from them cats who didn't communicate well
Cause them was them niggas that would've had me in jail


At fifteen I carried alot of wieght on my back
Me and my brother infact, I kept my money intact
I mad my real power moves soon as Juv' got one
Headed straight to the irish 
Channel
 nigga who got guns?
Shit my people Bobby and surviva got hit too
And I heard my name was poppin up in some shit too
Wasn't no cool cans off googlin no more
It was either cry like a bitch or go and settle the score
My first case wanted my respect in the worst way
Couldn't tell me shit when I was hungry and thirs-ty
Have a nigga way out his religion ya heard me
I guess it's punishment to who and never was worthy
Every since I leanred about guns and coke
I made a vow to myself that I would never go broke
Do what I gotta do to eat
I probably can't play no sports but I can work these streets",https://genius.com/Juvenile-juve-the-great-lyrics

Messin' with you kinda feel like we havin' intercourse

I circle your area, I'm a cartwheel
I want to know how your booty move in them hard heels
You got a nice rack, can I get a boob shot?
I put in work, I got my condoms in my tool box

Break a Brick Down,Reality Check,2006.0,"(This is, this is, this is, this is!!)
Yeah... ha ha!
Whoahh (yeah)

You put the coke in a tube, and whaddya get
Whatever you want a car to the flip of your wrist
Drug traffickin been happenin since seventy-six
They lock us up cause government be wantin tax from the shit
I call my people in Detroit, they get that 9-1-1
Ho gon' put it in her pussy and come flyin with son
And it's plenty full so he gonna consignment some
Same nigga that I be gettin the llama's from
Got yay too! How you want it? Soft piece or hard piece?
Work ain't movin, I'll break it down in a heartbeat
I'm tryin to put the new 25's on my Rover
So when I hit the lakefront they gotta slide over
Yeahhh, these hoes be respctin my cars
When I pass, they smile and start adjustin they bras
Niggas peep hard and get to twistin they lips
But they could easily meet God so homey don't even trip

Ridin with the strap on my lap, other one in the dash
On the way to drop this nigga off a fo'-and-a-half
Last time he put my shit on his tongue
He frowned up, cause the boy was NUMB
Can you break a brick down? I can break a brick down
Can you break a brick down? I can break a brick down
Can you break a brick down? I can break a brick down
I can break a brick down, but I prefer to sellin it whole

I read the paper today and everything was kinda chill
Word is circulatin niggas is tryin to find a deal
So he could ride behind the wheel
Of the 300 and put the dub deuces in the grill
You think you can't get killed? Me neither
That's why we always forced to keep heaters
A quick ruckus if a bitch touch us
Ain't got no beef with no Muslims but move or you get hit brother
These streets move forward and backwards
These fiends out'chea somethin more than just actors
One nigga get popped, another fo' get a package
Watchin out for the law man patrollin the action
What next? We tryin to bring it back to the team
Let our dogs see how it is to do your own thing
Not like Baby though, really put your own bling
You ain't doin nuttin for me nigga, do your own thing

Ridin with the strap on my lap, other one in the dash
On the way to drop this nigga off a fo'-and-a-half

Can you break a brick down? I can break a brick down
Can you break a brick down? I can break a brick down
Can you break a brick down? I can break a brick down
I can break a brick down, but I prefer to sellin it whole

G shit to 'em, I don't just write rhymes
Goin platinum offa talkin about my lifetimes
I'm gettin love in these streets cause they like how I rock
I'm just a thug on the beat, fuck a hip-hop cop
Not jumpin on the bandwagon to get my props
Got somethin happenin fo' me right within my block
Now, everybody wanna be the king of somethin
I guess I'll just call myself the king of hustlin
I make things happen nigga, I'm a panhandler
Shit not like how it's lookin on camera
Won't exercise the right to put the bandana up
And nobody gon' handle us, we never put the hammers up
You couldn't make it where I survive
Right now my city murder rate is at it's all time high
And it's a must I have the piece in sight
When I'm drivin know I'm showin them no teeth, just eyes

He done crossed the line of scrimmage is the one I kill, and I feel
That the marker should be first and goal
And I got the ball of course, goin in to sco' - nigga

Man, I swear I be like the robot
Programmed to get money and stop only when I run out
Models on the table in case a nigga get thirsty
Models by the table feel like five years Thursday
I'm a fly nigga, I know what you like, women
I'm on my Louis Vuiton burgen, it's quite leaning
They say my snigger here in his thirty till the life's finished
I tell them big 'cause I'm a classic, I like tennis
Jordon, burdon, juby, you can say the rest
Burn down the novelity minus the big in that
No swine as the alcohol in grand that
Looking for that clean pussy that no other man has
I come to sort the game up, I'm tearing it
Forget the man with the suit, you're about to learn it

My family good, my people stroot, just shob is a motherfucker obligate
Make a toast to the good life, make a toast to the good life

Is better say I got a new at least I lay swag
Feeling good, my people just got released home
I need to rap when I'm telling about this threesome
Just money, black cards chris honeys
Make everybody gather alone but you risk none
Prick runners, that's what I came up around
But ask a nigga some, nigga tear your wheel for the run
Big stonner, cardiac clean the leans
I spend the summer in a Hummer when I'm in the bends
Still rolling, even after the wheel stops
Fuck jill and drop it down at the hill top
I be shaping the sex, I'm in the lean up
Small in the stomach and I ain't even did a sit up
Nino, I'll be doing me in this golf curse
And I celebrate, let's start it up with a shot toast
It's a celebration I done made it past 21 feeling like a top gun
I'm still standing above the ground, you know it's going down
My family good, my people stroot, just shob is a motherfucker obligate

He told my business to a bitch, I had to fuck him up
When I confronted this nigga, he got highly upset
Took off his shirt, booted up, then looked down to my chest
So I slammed his ass, the nigga started to kick
I went to stompin' in his face, fuckin' up his shit
Gave him a good ass whippin', then I started to steppin'
I saw him reachin' in his pants, I seen he was stressin'
The niggas was stuntin', but I had mine
Five times through the chest, family outside cryin'
On the way back home, I saw this shybe ass lady
Polo down, hair fixed, and some gold earrings
I asked just where she's headed, she said ""7th Ward""
Release the fine bitch out the St. Bernard
She hopped in the ride, I take the hoe to Popeye's
Got a three piece white, cold drink, and small fries
The hoe got full, we went to the Rochambeau
Took off her clothes and bust three nuts and after that I was through
Took her halfway home and told the bitch ""Get on""
Didn't give a fuck about her 'cause I gave her the bone
Every day somebody else will get, hung by the gaffler

Don't stunt, nigga, my K hold fifty
And I will use, in a minute you six feet
I refuse to lose, I issue blues
It'll be no clues
When I strike, you lose
I tip-toe light in Reebok shoes
Your issue's.. where I hang
You cannot stand without your pistol in your hand
You ain't no man
You get ran.. off tha set... like a bitch
And if you stay.. it's trigga play
Motherfucker, you get split
And once it's on, it's on, you all in
I'm comin' full force after tha hissin'
Stay off tha block.. cause everyday I spin tha ben
Without a grin
Hot Boy$ I represent.. to tha end
Just me and my girlfriend
We out to win
Still got ki's for ten
I get from B
Bring 'em straight in tha U.P.T
After tha pack it's chance for me off six deep
I front a nigga
Tried to play me, ain't playin' me
Thought it was all gravy
He got his issue
(Chorus4x )
It's gon' be 187 after 187
It's gon' be blukah after blukah out my MAC-11
They got a lot of.. niggas tryin' ta.. get me killed
But I done flipped.. tha fuckin' script.. and played it real
Now I'm dippin'.. an Expidition.. around tha corner
And can do.. just about.. whatever I want
I'm money-rollin'.. and it's legal
And ain't no quittin' in tha Regal
Behind tha tints.. my chopper's spittin'

It's like a movie.. they wanna do me.. it's on again
I know it's showin'.. how niggas scorin'.. I can hear ya talkin'
Niggas knowin'.. now they hoin'.. to me for offers
I can't holla.. don't have no powder.. until tomorrow
But I got a.. couple of dollars.. that you can borrow
Nigga, go
You're 'round my door.. you're drawin' heat
You can go.. but on this porch you destroyin' me
No exception.. at disrespectin'.. can't let it happen
Now you step in.. my fuckin' section.. talkin' 'bout jackin'

Duck.. nigga, duck
Cuz when I come I gon' bust.. fifty-plus
Don't give a fuck who in tha way
It's on you.. when I spray
Whoever hit, look here, it's on you
Tha B.G. and Juvenile.. tear it down
We get them pistols in our hand.. and act a clown
Niggas fucked up don't know.. what to expect
Cash Money liable to do anything next
Fly around your set in a private jet
Have your bitch next to me in a Corvette
Or ridin' on tha back of my motorbike
Around tha second line stun'n with tha loud pipes (vroom vroom)

We showcasin', bodies erasin'.. we want it all

Seven figures.. me and my niggas.. we comin' up
Gettin' rid of.. tha garbage litter.. with fifty-plus
Now we drainin'.. cuz that 'caine in-side of our nose

What U Scared 4,Project English,2001.0,"I'd be a stupid motha fucka if I'm stuck in his pot
I ain't waitin to see what nigga out here love me or not
I say I hate em from a distance and they scopin' my neck
But these diamonds even cost me M-R and cars on my deck
And I can already vision people sayin I'm wrong
But I rather his momma than my momma singin that song
Besides chickens gon' be chickens and ducks gonna be ducks
And I'm all around guerrilla that love playin them cuts
Im'a attached to the streets, those niggas in the pens
Started problems wit ol' tymers that did ten
And this bitch curly head still been in the case
But he ain't man enough to leave a real one in the face
And to you 4-6 and 8 bitches wit t.v. Pranks
You jeopardize my living quarters, wanna see me sank
But I got news for everyone of y'all
I know who yah is, plus I won't be satisfied until I go in yah crib

Whatcha getting scared for? Don't get spooked
You was a bad mother fucker at first stunt too
Lookin fed up so me and Wheezy we comin through
And who ever sides yappin we gon' punish em too

Armed and Dangerous, Rich and Famous, Young and Restless

I just got one suggestion, ask yah Testem, this cuz get hectic
Send one through your son's intestines
Lock, snock lung through testin's
If the portrait, bodies piled up on porches, it won't be gorgeous
Ride with the torch, scorchin, ready to blaze
Step in me ways, kidnap your car for 70 days
And let it be said Holly Grove's the home of a soldier
And if a nigga breathe wrong than it's over
I never love ya, my metal slug ya
If you kept on fuckin wit the squad
Put the coward's stomach by his thighs, nothin survives
And as far as the coke, 20 bricks month and supply
And as far as the dope, plenty chips come and say ""Hi""
Drop 3-2 roll, all black, buttons and shyer
I don't need you hoe
Jack my dick, cum in yah eyes
What?


Nigga C'mon
You gotta love us
Bumpin inside of humma's
Ride as thugga's, we who be
Think that them coward's busta's
Why we hustlin in they sleep
We be in that powder smuggle by the doubles every week
And if one of them cowards run up try to knock him off his feet
The brotha is Wheezy, love it or leave me
Gats hug it and squeeze it
Crack, bundle it easy
Run it wit these n' murderers, crooks and x-cons
Yah test mine I give it to yah chest 6 times

I believe in me and my family cuz niggas is broads
That leave you slanted, thugged out wit a conspiracy charge
All pussy ain't the pussy like money and drugs
I'm dickin bitches that trial and I'm the jury and judge
I make sure I separate it, though I hate when I love
Its just me, Cash Money Millionaires that wackin the plug

Now dis fool name of Terrel
Seems he was doin' swell
Over tha years where he sell
Was betta than clientele
My niggas was gettin' big
He slung eva since a kid
And always got glamour rides for all of tha shit he did
He had a bad attitude
Nigga selfish and rude
One day he got in a fight in gloom and he gone killed a dude
That's when A.T.F. got hot
Surveillance up on tha block
They knew he was runnin' shop
But dis nigga wouldn't stop
Terrel was a knucklehead
He said mothafuck a fed
Look come if you wanna come and off with you bitches head
Surely dem people came
Git down on yo face and hand
They took tha dope and choked terrel wit a rope man
He thought he would go to jail
5-0 took tha bitch to hell
They took tha dope and said he got crossed in drug sale

Tha next one is sharolin
Addicted to heroin
Gave birth to her son at 15 and now she scared of him
Look he was a balla' so
That made her a stupid ho
I heard he sold his dope out a house in the caliope
Stung her for much furl
Then shot it up his arm
Dat dope bust her heart and that's how sharolin left the world
Now guess what her son use
He snorted boy(heroin) too
He robbed some nigga dat brung drama to his whole crew
Dat multiplied enemies
One of em' slangin' keys
And they got boys who got boys that strapped with artillery's
Now he done on his knees
Beggin' Lord help me please
Dat nite he got on dat dope and went out he was off his knees
Walkin' without a gun
They caught him roun' hit and run
Pulled out dat Tommy gun
Knockin' holes in his fuckin' lung

So he hired 5 killas that snort up that heroin
To keep his self from being affected
Whoever mentioned his name got they head-bust on next shit
That next hit
He sent was up in the 2nd line
Dat Lexus pulled up shells started flyin'
People started runnin' and cryin' lyin'
In tha street was tha one that they came for
Bystanders got hit up so a kid in this drug war
That was five
So she couldn't survive
Homicides said where they at
It happenin' on our side
But in dem' killas' eyes, they on dat dope so it ain't nothin
Reincarnation is the subject of that discussion
Shit somebody snitch dem people found tha location
Caught 2 out of tha 5 tha they got me down at tha station

Hit the block and made NBA money in one week
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty
Needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty
Now if the bitch ain't got my dice for me then I'm sorry
But i'ma leave everyone who outside bloody
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask

Them dick suckers long shoud have been in sentence may
I do a little something I got that cut to tie your thighs up
I'm not asthmatic I'm healthy and I could fuck
That teenage pussy I don't want so zip it up
And no satchatories having in here so catch a cut
Ohh how I love it when half your ass show
And you catch the side view it look like two elbows
And my dick stuck to my leg like velcro
Stop blocking and let them females go
If the hoes keep asking me up I got to stop her
I've been searching for me a lifipeepoper
I'm serious you should wanna fuck with me period
Because I'm a little bit more then just a lyricist


This is to alisha, camren, roshon and don
If you fuck with pimp baby show me your thong
Get your big ass up hoe you know this your song
Big daddy gonna be smashing it till four in the morn
You doing them jeans yeah black you need to stop it
It look like you got a loaf of bread in your pocket
Should have followed you first ma and snatch you first
But when I'm drinking everyboady look like they got worth
I don't need to tell a woman what I'm worth
She gonna show me some affection when I raise my shirt
I ain't never bought a woman where I do my dirt
To a nice confined spot where I can lift that skirt
Hopefully she illegal with the head and all
Probably heard of my background and said I'm a dog
But I ain't about me baby it's about y'all
My fantasy is knocking four of y'all off

Shake that ass mami
If you trying to get to juvenile pass him
I'm not telling to tell you to put your man in past tense
It is just a little tiny favor that I'm asking

Show me that poor shooter any way you throw it I'm gonna do ya
Just let wardy do this manever
All thow I'm from the sewer
I like having relations
I punch a bitch in the head for playing with my patience
I make a local hoe turn hashin had me at the station
They hating saying that I violated my probation
Theres a lot of kinky shit going up in the clubs
We be popping exctasy looking for woman to hug
I promised not to get you caught up in these drugs
Put this gun in your purse mami and roll with a thug
Your girlfriends always saying she ain't like that
Well hold that right there mami I will be right back

Shake that ass mami
If you trying to get to juvenile pass him
I'm not telling to tell you to put your man in past tense
It is just a little tiny favor that I'm asking
Shake that ass mami
If you trying to get to juvenile pass him
I'm not telling to tell you to put your man in past tense
It is just a little tiny favor that I'm asking",https://genius.com/Juvenile-head-in-advance-lyrics

Break It Down,Cocky & Confident,2009,"(feat. Q Corvette)
Don't stop now get it get it
Get it get it, get it get it
Don't stop now get it get it
Get it get...

Look at how she movin, look at how she do it
Pop and know they payin, stayin workin her booty
But shorty's a winner, she ain't no beginner
Just look at the way she make her ass go up
She loves to break it down, break it down (down down down)
(Breakin it down) Break it down, break it down (she breakin it down)
She loves to break it down, break it down (down down down)
(Breakin it down) Break it down, break it down (she breakin it down)
M.J. girl right here ""I'm Bad""
Fuck that nigga right there, he fag!
What'chu lookin for girl I'm on
And I ain't gotta tell you shit but I'm grown
Don't stop now, get it get it
Want dick right now HA! Just admit it
As Lord is the witness
When times comes, I'ma give you the business
Left right then jack that juice
All you can say is big daddy is good
I can have you in my steak
You can be a side dish on my plate
And I just ate and I'm still not straight
You could be the judge bitch hear my case!
I ain't talkin 'bout your girl right there
But your girl right there

She be all on the ground
She be poppin it and splittin like the circus in town
If that's your girl then oh my bad (my bad)
Just tryin to hold that ass (that ass)
It's amazing how she make it go
Rounnnnnnnnd
Shawty what you drinkin?
I wanna feel yo' brain, get in yo' thinkin
Later on let's lengthen
And just tell me the #, I don't need no ink pen
Yo' booty talk like reverends
And I just cain't pass my blessing
Everybody in the club's got questions
But ooh girl just keep 'em guessing
And get low my dear
Niggas is broke but not right chea
Not me, you got me wrong
I still got money from the ""Bling Bling"" song
Yeah! I got old (Ca$h Money)
Fuckin with me'll get you more (Ca$h Money)
I ain't talkin 'bout your girl right there
But your girl right there

Her ass go round and round
Forward back up and down
And when she back it up
Beep beep she make that truckin sound
Her ass go round and round
Forward back up and down
I ain't talkin 'bout her right there
But her right there (look at how she move it)",https://genius.com/Juvenile-break-it-down-lyrics
Imma Get Rich,Rejuvenation,2012,"I'm a get rich or die trying like 50
Ball like Hov', pop bottles like Diddy
Bitch, you're only visiting, 'cause this is my city
Blame it on your hoes just to say that I did it. 
I'm official like black and white stripes
That bitch you're calling your wife, I done had her like twice
I see you're watching, nigga, analyze right
Observe, I'm about to reach satelite heights
I lay my fucking law down, I don't take the shit
Ciroc bottles on the table, I don't drink this shit
No disrespect to Diddy, I do it for the hoes
Cameras in this bitch, we shootin Juv' exposed
I'm killing 'em momma, on my Louis and Dior shit
Juvi', you're winner, all your haters better fall bitch
I need a billion dollars cash, nothing counterfeited
Ain't got that Russel Simmons money, but I'm down to get it
Who, me? I'm tryin' to be a nigga rude group
I'm about to drop my own Juvenile fruit juice
Pull off, I act like Hov' and get a shoe deal
Fuck the world, the first day I ship 100 mil
I'm a get rich or die trying like 50
Ball like Hov' pop bottles like Diddy
Bitch, you're only visiting, 'cause this is my city
Blame it on your hoes just to say that I did it. 
Customized French suits, crocodile shoes
I'm elevated, it's all the conversation about you
I see you nigga living like you're seeing in a dream
'Cause I got translation imagination in a grin
So why the contracts that I'm trying to get paid
I got homes, I can say you anything and and say you're here from
Fly in the motherfucker swag, I got wheez
And I'm running like a company like Jimmy Ivine
You know you're getting money when you bitch are in Forbes
And you ain't gonna say a shit to get a bitch under the folds
And in the fin, the life it's gonna take it's own course
Nobody helping me and we open his own doors
Making too much money to be worried about credit
We're tired in my city as we're chatting like Betty's
Niggas don't get it and they act like it's a game torn
They won't mean the telethon, how could I explain it to them?
I'm a get rich or die trying like 50

When all the shit ain't going right, I'm who they're calling on
And you may hustle like I do, but shit, I'm fast with it
All the money you have it I'm a wipe my ass with it
I'm quite as good as fuck, I have the grant to it
You ain't able, but your momma had to sign for it
I got a lot of flavor, the one I'm sizing up
Juven deliver and sometimes feel like tisa hot
Blood shed when is a problem with them down the size
My niggas enter in your houses like the power lines
I'm good, homie, I put my father on it
My pain while I get hot they're getting the water on it
I'm the bad guy, everything and all black
And you ain't gotta say, bitch, I think I'm all it
I'm too gee, man, I gotta get two keys
You want me to show off for the show as they call the two keys
So say hello to the bad guy
I'm a better nigga but I'm still a mad fly
They say I'm ruthless, I'm just trying to stay alive
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, homie, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, nigga, I'm the bad guy
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, the one they always blame it on
I'm tired to work these other niggas ballet hanging on
My credit cards are master p, ain't no limit to 'em
I've car bushing and I put it, quit the finish to 'em
I love beef shit, I eat it with my baked potato
Live by the gorge and keep the gee, is gonna be greater later
Juvenile needle, I'm a real goodie
I'm hard born, but I'm calling a Portalbelle pussy
I don't play that, me and my road dogs
Get 'em up in as I chop the tip of your nose off
I'm real about the money, nigga, no flaws
Mercedes cooper, my speakers' knocking my doors off
So say hello to the bad guy

You want a television ship, but you're a fall guy
Back to the top 'cause it ain't hard
These niggas' fake up in a motherfucker, swear to God
I'm hating and I'm here to see you motherfucker starve
Bitches know who you is, you don't wanna set the charge
You gonna inspect my pants, you know how I wanna this
I'm a looking on a biscuit on that money train, that is a thing
They say I'm jail break, that even make a case
Niggas be talking about prison like that's a better place
Nobody with me anymore, I'm a forgotten homie
They're only riding on me, feel like they flying on me
So say hello to the bad guy
I'm a better nigga but I'm still a mad fly
They say I'm ruthless, I'm just trying to stay alive
So when you see me say hello to the bad guy

With the Project English album
And I'm gonna let young Mickey start this thing off, ya heard me
The New Orleans shit, the new stunna, the new shiner, the new reppa
Walk over here and get cha' shine on

Uh oh, Chicago's with those N.O. niggas
And we stock indo nigga
Ya see the amount of blood in my kinfolk niggas
And I don't think y'all really understand what y'all in fo' nigga
When a nigga got tens he got two blocks on em'
Catch ya mob street walkin' put them foo fights on em'
MC rodie around, we say fam or pharaoh
Both our families mo' gangsta than the damn Sopranos
They spit choppers and k's, we spray itchies
But we both quick to spray fifty, stay with me
They rock tees and Rees, we rock furs and Nikes
But we both well known for flippin' birds and ice
They stay stunnin a hundred, we say flickin'
They say that shit is fire, we say sendin' fendin'
Get little, that mean we about to leave
The cake is baked whodi, that mean y'all about to bleed

Uh oh, shit got damn, you know who I am
I'm as gangsta as Capone in this nasty ass fam
Where the fuck I'm from and where I represent
Platinum plaques, Bentleys, and presidents
Now wait a minute man, I done bought a choo-choo train
Don't chu' have a helicopter, yeah and a plane
You got a two-way pager, well I gotta phone
You gotta a million dollars, well I got I don't know
They say a nigga like me bling too much
Why, cause this watch, this chain, this ring too much
Make them dollars, pop them bottles
We zoned up in Caprices and Impalas (Errrr!)
Disregard that law, pop that car
Step up in the club and buy out the whole bar
Pay attention lil' daddy to the song I'm sangin'
I'ma put cha' on some other shit besides that blang
Daddy truck sharp, mama house bangin'
Brian Williams, just keep on brangin'
Check after check every time ya move ya neck
Nigga if i want it dog I'll buy respect

There you have it nigga, Project English nigga (Uh, uh, uh)
Hood rats and bling blingin' nigga (Uh, uh, uh)
Know what I'm sayin' let's get this money nigga (It go choo-choo)

I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, I’m 100 homie)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good ho)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s how I do it ho()
Verse 1 )
Chilling by my ho house
She told me I smoked too much
Ho, what you watching me for?
Look bitch, go out and do some
Crackhead  trying to sco' some
I just found out he straight feds
Convictions on his whole house
But he got out in 8 days
His mama was a dope fiend
His daddy was a OG
They found him in the dope house, he had too much, he OD’d
They found his little stash box
He told em that was my shit
They showed up at my front door’
I told em that was gossip
Didn't know what they was up to
So I got on my defense
And running to the police
Ain't even in my sequence
I don’t give a fuck though
Cause ya’ll ain't got no case bitch
And ya’ll ain't got no witness
Cause a dead nigga can’t say shit
Just got me some new land
Then I built a new fence
Warning to you white folks
Nigga’s bout to move in
Got my package this morning
Finished it by noon time
I still got my ’02 Benz
I just went and bought that new kind

I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s how I do it ho)
(Verse 2)
These bills too much to handle
Mama calling ANO
She’s bout to lose her Section 8, police ran in the back door’
Landlord saying move out
Road on took a new route
Plus she gotta come up with  deposit for a new house
I gotta get it ‘fore we all be on the curb
And all I got in this world is my balls and my word
I swear she gotta get hers or you gonna get yours
And I pray I don’t die cause lord knows I’m not insured
Prada Gang, them troops out
Time we let the truth out
They lying through they teeth so much they knocking they own tooth out
Showed up at the court house, I think I need to confess
How I’m killing these bitches, place me under arrest
She want a upgrade, I say first pass this quick test
I gave her A for her ass and a B for her breast
You know she blew that flute huh ?
You gave that ho the boot huh ?
That’s why you got that Buddha
I’m good at what I do hah
(Hook)
I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s all good woa)

I’m good at what I do (I’m good, I’m good, it’s how I do it ho)
(Verse 3)
I was at my car wash when LIL homie rolled up
He said Skip help me, I was in The hold up
What this look like ER ?, my life is like a sea saw
Why you come run, bring all that heat on me for?
Look, here come the police, now I’m fucked with no grease
Whip their guns out, screaming like they want beef
Then lil homie broke out
Fuck it then, I broke too
And the cops came, it turned into a pursuit
I caught up with lil homie
He told me I was tripping
He started to run again
When he did – I clipped him
The police watched the whole thing
We just ran bout 2 blocks
They cuffed us and they searched us
Then they found 2 rocks
Let me guess who this for
Guess for what? It ain't mine
I work at the car wash, I’m doing just quite fine
We gone go check yo spot
Then we gonna lock up
It’s been 15 minutes, my niggas cleaned the shop up

I reason with no one homie I got fa sho cliental
I'm a XL out here in the streets or lyin in jail
I'm quick tempored please limit ya words
I will send you in a hurry down south with the splurge
It's kind of hard to understand me cause I speak with a slur
But my guns speak a language all the people done heard
Streets sense gon' keep me in it for a minute
You fuckin with a general salute me lieutenant
I'm not too particular with lies
I look 'em in there eyes say a pray before you die
This ain't about me this about somethin thats spoke
You know runnin with a nigga while you cuttin his throat
Oh them loose lip bitches get hung from a rope you know
Bagged up and throwed off the side of a boat, oh!

Cock it, take Beretta then pop it
Give me that out ya pocket cause the vest can't stop it
East coast whassup, Down south whassup
West coast whassup, Mid West whassup

Keep on makin ya laws, I'm a keep breaking them
I can move a package in any city I'm stationed in
If ya son touchin my shit you better pray for him
Bust his head and catch me a flight to where the hatreds been
I ain't the only solider they got alot of these
All of these children make me know who dropped alot of seeds
I smoke till my eyes shut
Stay strapped so if you think about sneakin you better wise up
Hit you with the traqualizer let it fill ya head
Paralyze you have ya screamin ""I can't feel my legs""
Regardless of what a nigga or a bitch done said
The shell around ya get poked like eggs
I'm from the M-A-G-N-O-L-I-A
My bitches gonna listen to what the hell I say
You niggas gonna respect it or get out my way
Or the coroner gonna happen to do ya autopsy


You old niggas on ya last limb
Move over let some niggas who really want it come cash in
Suppose to get killed for cock blockin in cells
Solider bet you can't get no chronic up in hell
Fresh off the porch where the stash spot
I'm hungry tryna get the same respect that my Dad got
Got the chopper cut the wieght, nice in the stash box
Nigga be on paper so himmed up from the bad cops
How the hoes be actin hopin for child support
I need to snatch me a coat and endorse it with dope
I ain't even gotta speak on it I put my G on it
Niggas gon' let us get that whenever we want it
Beef is beef whenever the shit occurs
If it's real it's gon' resolve into metal for sure
But hit the right one he ain't respectin my bad
My only satisfaction will be poppin your ass

Gotta get the real out before they stake out
Put the kids in the safe house
Cake out, pull the champ and the stakes out

The precious moments are lost in the tide
You know your in your head it ain't what it seems
Just close your eyes and you can follow your dreams
Listen to your heart when you don't know what to do
Listen to your heart (I did this one for my son) and here it calling you
Listen to your heart hear the voices in your head
Listen to your heart, hear what it says
(Verse 1)
They about to see me up 'Cuffs up in the precinct
The police better be ready to beat me something decent
My furniture put out side before the lease end
They wouldn't mind if i was dead before 'da weekend
I'm Not an actor 'cause I don't know how to pretend
When everyone wants you dead, how 'can you keep friends?
Complaining to people ""HOW I""AM GONNA FEED THEM?""
Talkin like they write my raps and i really need them
This is the testament of Ne-No
From pennies to quarters to dollars to C notes
The author of the book onto which he not be re wrote
Food for the thought, something for your ego
Make sure to keep yourself surrounded by the right people
Take advantage of all the things that life teach you
Every dawg gotta say we all equal
Follow your heart and get ready for your sequel

You other cats betta wake up and focus
Cause we da only people having funerals if ya notice
And junior I'm Not tryin to put ya on the spot light
Just don't want ya caught in the chillin on the block life
Use an example of yo POPS life
Before you play the game you betta find out what the odds like
You gotta lot of street smarts and need the books to
Study your work and quit worryin what the cooks do
Were my sons at? Were my daughters at?
They got receivers out there we need quarterbacks
In this world everybody plays a part fam
If you confused just follow whats in your heart man

Life's a bitch and I fucked that ho with no lubrication
Ain't none in this bitch that's riding Zulu Nation

Whoahh, ah wodie, ah wodie, ah wodie

Ridin through the city on vogues
Cadillac with the suicide do's
Sayin in the hood mayne anythang goes
When they see the Cadillac let 'em know
How we do it like a ""T.C. soldier, New Orleans stunna""
""New Orleans stunna"" 
""T.C. soldier, New Orleans stunna""

You should have pardoned me, don't you know the boy clicks?
I'm in this thang, I got a B.T. and ward lip
Put on the culo, yeah I'm into that murder thang
I flame broil beef boy I'm the Burger Kang
I got the money first, then the respect came
Now I flip bitches like a biker at the X Games
I used to do the cash, now I do the check thang
I play the chess game, checkmatin e'rythang
I fuck with everybody, no it's not a set thang
I'm 
from the T.C. but I be on the West lane
I smoke purple it's the penny to my blunt stain
And flip the ceiling through the chips and the roulette thang


They say do I wanna die? I tell 'em you a lie
They say I'm tryin to kill myself my do's suicide
Yeah~! I'm on that Henny like Kanye
Hoes screamin Juvie I wanna be your Beyonce
Man I'm tryin to take over the world in the years back
Then I'ma crane 'til it's dry like a beer can
I put the blunt down then roll up another one
I smoke a lot of weed, dawg I need another one
You got knock in your trunk? Now that's a dumb question
My shit beatin like a Southern band drum section
Still in the game, I'ma retire good
No one could beat me but myself, I guess I'm Tiger Woods


Show me a realer hood, show me a realer set
Show me a realer nigga I ain't seen the nigga yet
I'm on target hittin everythang I shoot fo'
Player like myself attract the bitches like a shoe sto'
I ain't the man yet, but I show a sign

You can't hang around, my crew or my clique
Especially if you ain't about no gangsta shit

Kirby's round the corner playin' bones with Russ
I'm waitin' for my bitch to get off of the bus
She told me she could make it to my house by twelve
So we could get it on, just amongst ourselves
She came to, I had a blunt to blow
After that, I'ma be ready to fuck this ho
I ran up in it for an hour or so
Put her back in the bus and took a route to the store
Picked up some brew for the rest of my crew
And a couple of cigars for a blunt or two
Headed for the D.J. Way on Teledonna
Now this area was all about drama
Hoes was sweatin', I had my shades on
Ready to put the dick on any bitch that I played on
Now what's the haps with you and your clique?
I don't think you want no more gangsta shit
Mo I can roll, I'm just a baller from the South
Ready to knock any muthafuckin' pussy out
I got bitches on the side wanna ride with nine
But don't understand the way that I kicks the style
But I'm a flexor, to riggedy-wrecks-a nigga from the Nolia
I'm goin' out everytime when I kick I'm like a solja
Niggas don't understand the way that I flow
The fliz-no is slow, so check this out bro

Now you can't hang around, my crew or my clique
Especially if you ain't about no gangsta shit
You can't hang around, my crew or my clique
Especially if you ain't about no gangsta shit

I kicks the shit that make them niggas say ""ooh""
That'll make them hoes say ""Yeah, that must be that nigga Juv""
I'm from the, wild side of the city
What a pity, I'm wild, like a muthafuckin' crazed Frank Nitty
I'm not the old days nigga that's comin' with the gats
Nigga where you at? Nigga where you at? Nigga where you at?
Give me a bag of powder, watch me twitch
I might go crazy and wanna kill in this bitch
I seen a lot of niggas talk shit about me
But don't know a muthafuckin' thing about me
So keep my name outta your mouth and you just might just don't see the Glock
POP every time I see your ass on my block
Shop close for the hoes, that used to think that Juv would trick
But bitch how you feel? 'Cause you ain't got shit
Niggas wanna play these games and don't know
That I am the wickedest one you know bro
I'm just a nigga from off the side
So what's up? I'm 'bout to rock in the house, right?
Microphone check one two, now what's the haps?
It's time for me to put my neighborhood on the map
I'm from the neighborhood of the wild Magnolia
Home of the killas, the trillas, the soljas
Droppin' muthafuckas like an everyday habit
If I see your fine, sexy bitch, I'ma stab it
Comin' from my head, my skin tone is red
Ready to put the muthafuckin' black boy to bed
I ain't never was afraid of no war
'Cause where I come from, we snort powder and we roar

Now you can't hang around, my crew or my clique
Especially if you ain't about no gangsta shit
You can't hang around, my crew or my clique
Especially if you ain't about no gangsta shit

I'm in the Nolia, lookin' for the Poppers
Took me a hit off the blunt, then I spot her
Ho that I know, bout twenty years of age
A pepper-red bitch with extensions in her head
Now she was the type to put you in a plot ball
Her last old man done got his head knocked off
But fuck I want the pussy so let's see what she's about
She gave me the phone number and the address to her house
I passed by late, she stayed on South Mero
Walked in the door with my three eight zero
Popped on that ass, got her nothin', I was outty
Now she calls me sayin' how she feel about me
""Come back to me, Juvenile, I'm beggin' you please""
""Won't you just come back to me, Juvenile, I'm beggin' you please""
Now, if I was King, just imagine that shit
I'd have the Queen back smackin' that bitch
Now drop to your knees and kiss, and you tease
Of that, hell of a guy Mister J-U-V
I want riches, fuck bitches and them hoes
No better than a sweater, fella, 'cause I won't let her
Ho blow my head off, and take me off ground
Knowin' inside that a bitch could bring me down
Juvenile let a ho trap me?
That ain't the hamp, I'm on the map ayo I'm in the house
And I'm on the map G

Juvenile: I Need it in my life, I want it in my life
Come put it in my life, Ima keep it in my life

It's that nigga Juve, from the magnolia, still loakin
You hoes know what's happenin with me
Bust that pussy open
Loose chest, loose booty
Round down and up
If a gangsta can't touch it, what you bouncin it fo'
Now give me leway, watch how a G play
Watch how my name get caught up in the he and she say
Its UTP day, we with the streets may
They represent us when they hear us at the DJs
Break bread with me, nigga is ya mad with me
Thought we was beefin, your supposed to spend your cash with me
I'm in here last with me, hold me down, give me a whip, give me
A bitch and let her blow me down
I'm so gutter, I'm so slick, i'm so grimey
I promise you something and I betcha don't find me
I'm a eat, purchase, whatever I please
CO, give me the keys, aww please, I need two of these


I'm a be so courageous
And so contagious
Until my fuckin rap sheets gonna recieve mo' pages

About being written on my face cuz I know fear mon' (fear mon')
Me and my team got a scheme to go light the block up
Skip, Smoove put in work and wacko poppin the chopper
I Scream the ""U"" cuz I mean it
The only difference is you be throwing your shit up when you screamin
I Seen it, shit all of the obstacles that I been through
What make you think i'm a be scared of a bitch like you
I'm ya dog, let me get it all consignment
You ain't paid them last people yet
Dog don't even remind me
I gain knowlege, my game polished, and it is obvious
You can't block it, you can't knock it, this is profit


Can I untape the clips and chill ?
Show my nigga its real
Can my people shop in Beverly Hills
I got alot of work I know thats gonna be ahead of me still
But my peace mentality gon' keep me ahead in the field
Pardon me, but I got paper to chase
Now cut thru the talking and bring me straight to the safe
I know where the cameras at and I'm destroying the tape
I'm not leaving no evidence for the forensics to trace
I had a problem on my hand, a few bills I had been payin'
I figured about a lil'bit less than 75 grand
And my dog Rocky, caught a nickel for a pistol
Its serious when the federales comin' to get you
Life is at a standstill, outchere in this damn field
What you say, can get you and ya mans killed
This my last chance to come up, this gotta be it
Juve comin up, the first round' lottery pick",https://genius.com/Juvenile-juvenile-in-my-lifeexplicit-lyrics

'Cause she never see a swagger like that
'Cause I got it like that, got it, got it like that
'Cause I got it like that, got it, got it like that
You bitches got badge, see Nicky Minaj
Yeah, fuck the massage, I want a ménage
I got young money, I got all money
I could invest in her to beat the hoes for me
I'm watching you watch me, I study your step
Big in your smile, loving your hair
Your swagga, your talk, just the way that you walk
That must have been thought, I consider it odd
You find it wine at the top of a dime
I got footprints on my face, 'cause you run through my mind
You're one of a kind, you get better with time
You're calling my line? You better be lying

Stuck in the mall, spending your life
Better watch what you say, I be spending your wife
I fall out of control, I be living the life
What you make it a day I got triple or twice
Just early this morning couple sips on bad
I ain't worry about nothing, I'm gonna get it right back
I go ham what they day, make the killer no smack
Give me less than six months, make the killer know that
Six o clock in the morning fitting kay on a track
Twelve o clock in the evening, pop it out with the band
Twelve o clock in the air and I'm in the club with the rats
Politicking with models, everything is all wild
When I go to the mall I be dropping them sticks
'Cause I know one thing, I'm a get it right back

'Cause I got it like that, got it, got it like that
'Cause I got it like that, got it, got it like that
I'm chilling today, I'm back at it tomorrow
Make more money than you, I'll put that on my card
Spend my day in the stores, drink my night in the bars
Live my money in minutes from I know the beyond
Hold on type to you bro, 'cause you're feeling my vibe
She feeling my swag, I tell my vision to eyes
All these bottles of Rose, all the jewelery ice
She like what she's looking and she wanna see what it's like
She admire the struggle, pum pot and live what it is
Fifty thousand for trips, two hundred thousand for whips
I don't cry up for money, my time is told all the risk
On a beach in Miami, what's up I say to my crib
When I go to the mall I be dropping them sticks
'Cause I know one thing, I'm a get it right back

Smack the taste right up out of your mouth (POW!)
""I wa-, I wa-"" That's what I'm talkin' about (POW!)
Keep talkin' out the side of your mouth (POW!)

Since I hit the TV now I'm a hot topic
But that don't mean Skipper won't pop it
Ain't that that dude with the H2 and the nice wallet?
And I got four words - stay off my dick
You wanna make it to where Skip ain't got shit
So you could ride around town and spread your gossip
Make up stories like ""U.T.P. done dropped Skip""
""Juve' used the man, paid him and then got rich""
C'mon stop it, you're makin' it up
Damn, how much hate is enough, boy you faker than fuck
""I just saw Skip blazin' it up
With a dime piece, smilin', gettin' head in the truck
Look, right now he headed for us"" (Look!)
""You lyin' motherfucker, dude he right behind 'em, you a busta""
Cause that's your old lady he with
Them hoes is for everbody, stop savin' a bitch

Open my eyes when the sun rise, blazin'
First nigga on the strip, even if my block's hotter than Cajun
I cop them Haitan, Jamaicans, Cubans and Yanks
Program with every race, now I cuts my own steak
Known to take G trips to a town like Wimbleton
Get a bust' down spot and be servin' like Wimbledon
Black John McEnroe, my rap flows are clapped (uh-hu)
Supposed to be hot as Tabasco, look at them assholes now
Homie, when I'm seen there's a crowd
With head bustas off the streets talkin' loud, ready to wild
Get respect for a few things
Deranged, the chopper spit
And the first off the block to cop a new Range
Life is fast, I get cash and write about it
At night it ain't safe in the South, we bout it bout it
Doubt it and get bodied cause the shotty will lift -
Your big muscleman bodyguard off his shit

Who lil' daddy with the fitted cap turned back?
Know some of these niggas got respect, he tryin' to earn that
Hopefully one of these niggas with yayo will see that
And put him in the right position he tryin' to be at
They talkin' in the wind but they no better than the play though
They could make a carton or a t-shirt in a day though
I ain't tryin' to flex my power bitch but I got say so
And I could make a million; American, yen or peso
They say I got a attitude, that's not the issue at all
Don't get involved when I'm doin' what I have to do
I'm suttle now but I could turn into an animal
Blow it out of proportion and I ain't understandin' you
Not in it for the short, I want the long term
Fuck the government, I'mma take care of my own children
You gon' have to zip your lip up, before a nigga flip up
I don't think they understandin' me, holler at 'em Skipper

BREAK!!!

While you niggas steady talkin, we be gettin money
24/7 on the grizzy that's how we hustlin
We be gettin money, we be gettin money
We be gettin money over you we gettin money

I bleed lighter fluid, I'm on my barbecue
So keep you guard up boy 'fore I target you
I get plenty cheese, I'm a li'l macaroni
I'm shittin on 'em like my money got a bladder on it
Thug, you hustling with a gangster, put a saddle on it
Get rid of beef like a trunkload of cattle on me
I done married the game, you missed the ceremony
That bitch got papers on me, got me on alimony
The mayor went and told the chief to put a handle on me
Tourists visitin' to see what's all the pandemony
I parked the Benz, slanged and went and got the Phanton on em
They tried to tune a nigga out, I changed the channel on em
Bitches fallin in love, they burnin candles on me
Meanwhile these niggas schemin and scammin on me
Go 'head and hate, keep on, run in to what I carry on me
I'm at the plate with the bat, I'm doin the Barry homey!


Gene Gene with the thing now it's buckwild
Shoot a nigga, I ain't care, went to Juvenile
When I came home, it was ninety-six
Got a introduce, to the money bitch
All I want is bread, now I'm hood rich
Bankhead Shawty, let's do this
Fuck it I'm so rich, so I bless my wrists
A hundred carats, you silly rabbit
I won't stop now, I had to elevate
I'm a millionaire, and I ain't graduate
I'm ballin up the boozy, I gotta stomach ache
Don't ever wake up, yeah my life great

They tried to tune a nigga out, I changed the channel on me 

I'm somethin like a pimp, with a bitch to please
From the hood so I'll take a bitch to Mickey D's
I get plenty money, I get plenty cheese
Livin life high since the first day I hit the weed
Bought a Lambo, which now means I get to speed
Never know what I'ma do they call me Mr. Trickysleeves
Lil' momma out of line? I tell her hit the trees
Krystal wanna spend the night I told her wait 'til Vickie leaves
D-O-double-R, oh you can't forget G
H-Town, D-Town, on my way to T-Town
N.Y.C. me, watch me break a beat down
Lose a bitch, grab a badder bitch off the rebound
See a hater slide him, before my niggas him
Screamin money ain't a problem, watch me stick him up and rob him

Better back up before you get clapped up

Don't make me mad I will slap you if I have to
I ain't looking for marriage don't wanna be embarresed
All I want is a bag, full of green cabbage
They know its happenin you can tell how I dress
Throwbacks everyday like somethin brown on the chest
If I got enemies them cats be thuggin not sayin nothing
Me and my niggas'll pull it and buck it
And when my song play in the club I'm grabbin on ass
Hope my ole lady don't find out cause I'm doing her bad
Hey baby slide me ya number I might be on lean
Later on if you just chillin I'm a make that swing
I bring shit to the table when I come of course
Could be the reason while most these bitches done divorced
He never had time and wasn't treatin her right
He runnin with the click so she with me tonight

Do you think its all about money
Is that the only reason that you want me
Just put your name and ya number on a napkin
And later we can find out whats happenin

Where that chick, need super head
I need super head, I'm a super
I need super duper head
You bout to listen to what who said?
Ya partna, be calm, be cool I got ya
Just write ya number on a napkin
We can get it crackin what I ain't yo type?
Whats really happenin
Like its not been official
Don't miss the riddle money is definatly not the issue
We can ball out like crawfish
Lay up all day and watch
Tell your friends you gonna call them
You tired been at work all day and you going in
And we can do it like G
Roll me some weed, drop the top we gon' cruise on the scene
So whassup you fuckin with me?
Its nothing to me, and some sex its something to see


I don't go to clubs unless they got a party there
Plus I got X's and O's in my cardier
Nigga I'm the shit I'm filthy rich
My car like a jheri curl cause it come wit a kit
I can front you a hit or drop you a brick
And if you saw where I lived you'd probably shit
Enough about me well lets talk about my click
And rule one is never get into it over a bitch
But that's how it go its all about makin mo dough
Sellin mo records, and blowin mo dro'
Throwback jerseys and iced out chains
My piece so rocked up niggas think I'm on caine
But I only sip drank and I use to flip birds
Now I'm 21, 22 rippin curbs
And if you got some hoes nigga bring e'm in
Cause Flip and Juvie fuck e'm all like Wilt Chamberliegn",https://genius.com/Juvenile-all-about-money-lyrics

I met a freak from uptown
Talking saying I was young
And she could give me spun for tounge
Welcome to the home of the G-ing men
Had to figure out my uptown friends
Welcome to the home of the G-ing men
Had to figure out my uptown friends

Thought I was a dummy
Thought I was a young fool
And then they didn't believe it was little Juv
Then the thing I did made you change your mind
Like freak named Sharon
Said she was big and fun
But guess what yo, I geed her
I see you murder too much energy
So does Gia
I see you murder too much energy

I see you murder too much energy
So does Gia

Went back uptown, burned like a heater

For one evening
A quarter after three
Twinkle my goal
And put on some clothes
And that might have been for real
Now don't be sweatin
Just give him the praise
Arguing cause I'm thuggin again
I make a visit every day
And I be swurving
And fellas that he bout
After I smoke the weed

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at the bitches
And the sets go up 

Hey homie, you don't wanna get familiar with us
Fuckin' over you would give me and my niggas a rush
I'm sick of all you and the fortune and supposed to be thugs
Tellin' stories 'bout your life when that was not how it was
Yeah a nigga did some shit back in the days with the pack
Like in your hood, when you was out there gettin' paid with the crack
You get the fuck when you hear shots and it's not yo' peep
But if a ricochet hit you, you better pop yo' heat
Yeah you know I'm from the 'Nolia but you do not know me
Quit eyeballin' a nigga down 'fore you get shot homie
You don't wanna know what I've been thinkin' up
You better go 'head on and find you another spot to chill
'cause I've been drinkin' cuz
We see a light and everything ain't great
It's like everybody mind is in the same old state, ya know
I'll throw a nigga fucked up with his revenues
I'ma tell you four fuckin' things I'ma never do

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at the bitches
And the sets go up 

From the 3 to the 17, ey yo we doin' it big
If you're ghetto you know who Wacko and Juvenile is
New Orleans, see I'ma rep that, 'cause these my peeps
You could pick up some bad habits hangin' in these streets
Have you talkin' to this and that nigga and showin' your teeth
Walkin' round you like you took care and you handled your beef
Pissed off 'cause your hoe wanna come talk to me
To show me the little gift that she done bought for me
I take it back to when the big timers was pushin' the size
When niggas wore Dickies suits like it was regular jobs
We cop Adidas, ghost town and Anita's used to be packed
And rumors started poppin' and it started to crack
We used to drink Crazy Horse and shoot dice in the back
We had four rules in life and I can promise you that

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at the bitches
And the sets go up 

Now why you muggin' a nigga? Let that bitch go
Let her bounce with a gangsta out six coat
Let her wil' out and flick it off a disco
Let me gas up, dick her down and get ghost
Ain't trickin' for the vagina, I like to get throat
Yo' stupid ass tryin' to stay in here and lick toes
Good girls love G's, that's how the shit go
That's why niggas need to tighten up and get low
I know you heard of *clap-clap*, I'm gettin' doe
Let me check my palm pilot, I'm gettin' hoes
Let me check my squad' wallets, we gettin' close
My squad up in the crowd wilin', they spittin' more
Drive by in the '5-5, forget a '4
Five, five and another five, we get a show
Fifteen and another five, you'll get some blow
You hustlin' your block, pop and you get some more

(Two) Never turn my back on my city

Conversation With Tha Man Above,Being Myself,1995.0,"Why does Juvenile gotta suffer so much
All this love in the hood keeps me in a fuss
Last night, me and the fellas almost got smoked
We heard gunshots and we said ""we all broke""
A 2 mile chase hitting corners quick
Thank god we alright and made it to the bricks
Now I gotta carry a nine I guess
These brothas try to peel my cap, so I gotta put em to rest
Now is it really worth the fighting and fuss
We killed one of them, they killed one of us
A young teenage black male
Gave em a brand new 40 and he got locked in jail
They say thats how it's supposed to be
But I don't think that kind of life was chosen for me
So I send up the sin I pray
To the Lord to conversate
To end all of this hate

Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked

I wouldn't be alive if I didn't say
I'm the type of person that praise every day
Brothas in the hood ain't the same
They got a gun and they change
Now they say I changed cause I'm making records
But I'm still in the hood handing out some chicken
Teenage sistas getting happy drawls
Used to be quiet, now she do it all
It's hard to understand this shit
And everybody I question say ""life's a bitch""
My life is a bitch, because I made it that
So I'm praying to the Lord, please change me back

Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked

My family's not together like they should be
And I don't think they ever will be
My grandma is the only one that says she loves us
So whats the reason for the everyday scream fuss
Daddy just got killed last week
For my boy on the curb, may he rest in peace
Then they went and killed Teck
Now I'm thinking ""is the Juv next?""
I don't wanna run when I can't hide
Lord if I go, just make sure I'm on your side

Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked
Living inside ghetto is not a joke, not a joke
I keep on seeing fellas from hood getting smoked",https://genius.com/Juvenile-conversation-with-tha-man-above-lyrics
Still Here,Rejuvenation,2012,"Ain't that terrific? No one let you go and get all the shit that you want
The only thing is specific, Atlantic to Pacific, don't give a rat's ass
Up on the jet skies and led up do the back splash
'Cause you be yelling, you just set the hills
And you're the news in the Jimmy Choo's
That's why these dudes wanna interview
You tell them move, you're for juv' and they can't sit with you
They proud to call you a hoe
But guess what the fucker is far away and not say no
Get a child bullet and the head in bars stuck to a door
I got my hand cuffed so you're like a city cop
Nothing new world, bottle's gray, girl, six o clock
You get the paper from bed when all of these came
You fuck any shit, even when nigga's breath stink
Past, present and future, it's not a sex lane
You ain't denying, but what's so funny, your dress, hey
And we've been riding for a long time, oh yeah
And I'm so proud to say that you're mine
Even though sometimes you drive me crazy
But at the end of the day you're still my baby
You're still here, still right here
A woman know in five seconds if she wants you
You think you're really slipknot, don't you?
You can do it by yourself, why won't you?
And you don't need nobody help, why don't you
Marry yourself
You better get help, my homebro
This I felt from the top shelf, she was winding in it
I just wanted to shine, whad'up, my bedroom
White table cloth, 2012 a loss
Yeah, a life, proud to be boss
Your attitude pisses me off, acting like you've been rich
You're from the hood, you ain't shit
And I've been what you're real got it from the slim, bitches
Pock it some beans, bitches
But ain't hot stocks up and throw words in a pub
Team five cause real fall apart, tell 'em from heart
And we've been riding for a long time, oh yeah
And I'm so proud to say that you're mine
Even though sometimes you drive me crazy
But at the end of the day you're still my baby
You're still here, still right here
Yeah, that's my bullshit, got the shit together
Yeah, in a rough, we're gonna be rich forever
Yeah, she addicted to rich and skinny and chip and pepper
I'm addicted to automotors and limon pepper
Just tell her do it in the back and shawty is whatever
From the big ball and parties to the get togethers
In a drop they deny, there's some different ladder
Devil 07, James Bond, that's some different texture
From the years I heard furr to the red bottoms
She better got my back, I'm just paying hymons
She got charisma and slang, I'm just being honest
And she give me good brains, I don't need no college
Gee five all auto, I don't need pilot
Cruise around the world, no street maleadge
Anything we want then we buy it
And if you can't relate, don't require it
And we've been riding for a long time, oh yeah
And I'm so proud to say that you're mine

Pay Tha Rent (Single),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Feat. Jeezy & Yo Gotti

You love that hood that you represent
You bout that working and all that money spent
A nigga owe you every cent
My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent
My niggas busting just to pay the rent
Cause bitches nothing we need or set
We reunite nigga when we spend
My niggas hustle hard just to pay the rent

NO's my birthplace, thug water my T-shirt
I'm uptown in these hot blocks where there feens walk then this feet heard
It's DJ on rebirth, fat boys on stakeout
No hard heels just chuck taylors
In case I might break up
Right now is drought season
Watch how it's gonna play out
Last night two teenagers got killed up in Jose house
Feel like there's no way out
Guess I gotta just stay down
Play ball and sell dope
Project's my playground
D bought a new condo
He ain't even sleep in his bed yet
Cause this girl all in his D talking 'bout bill he ain't even pay yet
Thought how to be cool with it
Real niggas ain't bad at it
These motherfuckers who owe me
Chopping off their head now


I go back like dro bags
Nigga Michael Jordan nigga 96
Streets dry, I came through
Lebron james Game 6
Drive lane right behind the back
Two cars back on my main drive
They Pulling on they find the bricks
Ain't Worried Bout It cause my mane lie
On Two A pack too fly
Selling in the street no B by
Why they call it white president
Niggas all I see is this green god
Nigga I ain't going to my mama house
Try being my mama mouth
Your trap boomin you ain't rit up
You don't need last for half hour
Tap for they owe me
DEA they want me
Still serve the whole hood out the town
Theat the prices like my compound
Bag landed me the touchdown
They was going for the touchdown
Nigga cask up before they touched down


It's summer town my airport, my house light 400 degrees
Money long my bills high so still flippin money in these streets
Juvenile, I've been wild, big pistols, coke piles
Old Chevy, big wheels
Tight motor, gun loud
Don't know hard
You a bitch nigga
Ten bricks you a rich nigga
Part time i rap nigga
Now out of town i hits niggas
Can't shake my problems
Low key I'll be robbin'
Weapon of choice that .38
Cause I fell in love in revolvers
I ain't leaving no shells
I ain't going no jail
I ain't leaving no witness nigga
Everybody go to hell
Everybody had a struggle
Everybody had a hustle
This everybody who you're fucking with
Nigga why the fuck you coughing?
Is you feel word?
Ain't nothing word
Made a living out birds
Yeah Nigga that's on my word

All you niggas selling garbage
Go put that shit in the toilet and flush it
You know why they don't school from you no more cause they don't trust it
You had some loyal customers but now they all disgusted
I pop up out of nowhere with that fire like surprise
When you see me in the club, me and my niggas looking fly like


I'm out here in the thuggin, don't worry me for nothing
Say you don't believe in God today you gon' believe in something

They searchers at the door but we still in here with them bangers
Security can't control us, can't hold us, they can't contain us

Fa sho' nigga, off top
Believe this playboy, fa sho' nigga

I'm the #1 stunna, don't flinch you bitch
I cash in quick and go and flash my 6
Twenty inch dub niggas how you love that bitch?
20 ki's or hard blocks, we call them bricks
I'm a Uptown survivor, niggas stash the lick
Just bought a new Beemer, X-5 the bitch
Puttin dubs with a kit nigga, flash yo' shit
Puttin ice in my grill, fuck a classy bitch
I'm a Uptown thug, can't you see that shit?
I'm around the way hunt for quarter ki's and bricks
You can catch me at the club with a ghetto bitch
Or you can see me at my mansion with a nasty bitch
Flat screen, loud music, me and Fresh a bitch
Pullin out the driveway with new cars and shit
Palm trees feelin good nigga we love this shit
Watchin ducks nigga bucks, but hold up bitch

Let me get my hustle on, nigga all for Nol'
Let me make a hundred mill', nigga slow but sho'
Let me spin my new wheels in front yo' do'
Let me hit the battlefield nigga slangin snow

I wonder why niggas always be doin stupid shit
No sense involved at all, it's foolishness
Now if a nigga take it and somebody hit yo' stash
Is you goin to bust his ass or are you gonna let that pass?
Besides, it only was a bundle of dough
You a hustler nigga, you know how to get you some mo'
Just tighten up yo' circle and surveillance your spot
If you catch a nigga touchin somethin, he gettin got
Now carry on with whatcha doin 'fore the people get hot
Leave them hoes alone cause they the reason we gettin got
If you owe a nigga pay him they be holdin a grudge
He don't want to take a loss but he'll take it in blood
Make sure fiends don't pass, make all the cash
Big fired bags and floss on they ass
I've been through some shit, that make me a survivalist
I may be a lot of different things, but I'm not a bitch

But anyway, I'm not the subject of the matter
All y'all bitch ass niggas I'm comin after
Cause the minute that I start slippin
Look at who is gon' be tryin to get in my position, niggas is grimin
But what they don't know, I got some killers that's behind me
I used to pull it off way back in the early 90's
If any one of y'all wanna do it we can do it
Don't hold it on your chest dog, don't be pumpin fluid

I'm a Uptown hunter on Washington 6th
Set the line goin down (?) a bitch
They got that iron Uptown and they slangin it quick
Valence is my home, I'ma rep 'til I'm gone
Valence and Magnolia, but Greyhead roam
Magnolia Projects is where I set my roam

Line of Fire,Reality Check,2006.0,"As far as I can remember, whodie, dude was a clown
But he still used to be in on everything that went down
Hooked me up for 250 a pound
Shit I figured I could make a fire come-up serving 60 an ounce
It was that poo though, and I wasn’t about getting played
From a couple of dreads probably in with the feds, he said
“We didn’t come here to accept no loss
Me selling it to you wholesale at minimum cost”
Look dread, I’ve been around a long time
And you ain’t gon sell me no anything, I’m on mine
They answered with guns instead of with tongues
They hit lil daddy up twice, once in both of his lungs. Shit
We buss back, them niggas still got hit
Fuckin’ with some new Jamaicans in the bricks, who look like a snitch
So I played as though I wasn’t there
I took a crucial lick in the pocket, but I didn’t care, I was……

All the shit that I done been through in the past few years
I think the Lord that I’m still breathing, and I’m still here
I’m glad I wasn’t drinking when I had that fight
Cause lil daddy would’ve probably lost his life that night
I’m a rapper, but I’m a man too
And I’m not trying to fuck over you whodie, I’m trying to understand you
There’s only so much I can handle
You shouldn’t never tried to use a nigga as an example
On top of that my people stole from me
And I was hooking them up, about to take them on the road with me
I tightened my circle with limited trust
Can’t no outsiders come take a trip with me on a bus
I’m not concerned about you keeping in touch
My only hollers when I’m seeing you bruh, that the G in me bruh
I said and mean it, look nigga I’m working
I got something for you bitches, yeah I see yall searching. Holla...

Verse 3:
Nigga trying to take me to court for stealing
Plus can’t find another way to approach a million
It was funny til they subpoenaed me to be the opposed
These niggas ain’t positive, these is hoes
You better watch them fellas, them cats is thieves
They stole one of Michael Jackson’s songs with ease
Still I wasn’t trippin, I won that case
Now the right muthafuckin smile is on my face
And I teach my niggas how to hold they ground
A 38’s an A.K. when the shit goes down
Dead nigga can’t tell me how the shit gon sound
We could quickly turn it into a complete ghost town, what?
It’s not about me having a war
It’s about me not obeying the law

Nigga was talkin about they was comin out like players tonight
They won't let me in with my pistol I'm okay with the knife-a
Anything I can get my hands on when the fight starts
Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand, by the right bar
Get the wife and she could {?} {?} light stars
She ain't stupid, she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records, play the songs for the kids
For instance, I can come through bouncin in this bitch like what
And she's figured this shit, she ready to give that life up
Wonderin how do it feel to be with G's like us
Be in a better situation than that all night bus
You're wild hoe be fuckin up my G's

Nope, I ain't rockin with them boys I was with
But I'm still blingin and showin off my toys in this bitch
When a real nigga show up hoes switch up they games
Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names
Claimin, she ain't nuttin like them boys be sayin
Shit I'm only tryin to knock the pussy outta the frame
Look here, I tried to chill but they gave me some mills
Me and Mannie back at it, 'bout to get another deal

Hit ya everywhere in your body but under your feet
I play it raw when I'm in beef, I'm a hot boy that's heat
Get it how ya live is how it is where I be
Fuck a nigga's how I feel, no nigga steppin' on my toes
Without feelin' blockah, blockah from four fours
I'm a dog with a gun in my hand I cut loose
You're on the other end of that pistol, it's on you
Get hit up, chopped up, did somethin' awful
Zipped up, boxed up, put straight in a coffin
Ain't part of my clique, fuck ya nigga, don't please me
I don't love ya nigga, you're no good, playa
I don't trust ya, nigga
To me you ain't nuttin' but a bust nigga, what
Man, pop that nigga, man, kill that bitch
Man, shoot that nigga, man, spank that bitch
Man, down that nigga, execute that bitch
Put fifty rounds in that nigga is what'cha do that bitch
Man, pop that nigga, man, kill that bitch
Man, shoot that nigga, man, spank that bitch
Man, down that nigga, execute that bitch
Put fifty rounds in that nigga is what'cha do that bitch
Man, pop that nigga, man, kill that bitch
Man, shoot that nigga, man, spank that bitch
Man, down that nigga, execute that bitch
Put fifty rounds in that nigga is what'cha do that bitch
Man, pop that nigga, man, kill that bitch
Man, shoot that nigga, man, spank that bitch
Man, down that nigga, execute that bitch
Put fifty rounds in that nigga is what'cha do that bitch
Ya heard me
Put fifty rounds in that nigga's what'cha do that bitch
Fuck him, ya heard me, fuck his whole clique, nigga
Ya don't like me, I don't like you, nigga
You don't like me that mean you don't like my clique
I don't like you that mean I don't like you
The niggas ya fuck with, the niggas you affiliate with, ya heard me
Any nigga who speak to ya, nigga, back you up, nigga
Fuck you and all them too, nigga, ya heard me
It's Cash Money for life, ya heard me
Fuck all them old bitch ass niggas throwin' bricks 
It's real over here, nigga, ya heard me
We got this here and we holdin' this here down
Ya heard me, we gon' keep it like that, though, ya dig, nigga
Baby, Slim, Juvie, B.Geezy, Turk, Weezy, Fresh, ya heard me
Joe Casey, Travey ya heard me, all tha shots, nigga
We comin' through, nigga, we layin' it down, nigga
And we just doin' what we do, keepin' it real",https://genius.com/Juvenile-f-that-nigga-lyrics
Animal (Explicit),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Gentlemen and ladies, it's your boy, the dude
Freaky-fre, fre, fre-eh-Fresh
We gon' bring it to you somethin like this

Woof, I'm a animal, yes I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes I am a animal
I'm a animal, yes I am a animal

How you just gon' back me up and I'm 2 dollars from bein rich
You oughta be grateful a nigga like me even see you BITCH
I was thinkin about rockin Arribas, but the gators look nice
Nigga was talkin about they was comin out like players tonight
They won't let me in with my pistol I'm okay with the knife-a
Anything I can get my hands on when the fight starts
Could get one of these hoes that's gotta stand, by the right bar
Get the wife and she could {?} {?} light stars
She ain't stupid, she recognize who it is
Enjoy the lyrics on the records, play the songs for the kids
For instance, I can come through bouncin in this bitch like what
And she's figured this shit, she ready to give that life up
Wonderin how do it feel to be with G's like us
Be in a better situation than that all night bus
You're wild hoe be fuckin up my G's
You better get back, I spent six and a quarter for these, ya hear me?


Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it
Get gorilla with it, get gorilla with it

I see you watchin how the boy comes to Grover
And you wanna overthrown him, knock him off his throne
Your potnahs rockin with you 'til they find out who it is
Then they gon' try to convince y'all to leave it alone
I'm here to sabotage what enemies accomplish
They're not about the camouflage, the homies that I ride with
I keeps it ghetto for my street people and convicts
I don't vouch for nobody, I just make sure I pay homage
Hey shorty, this nigga here's a vet like Shaq
I don't have to control the ball but I control that rap
If I smack you on your ass you gonna throw that back
They like it when a gangster take control like that
She feels protected when she in that Lexus
Givin me head, got me takin all wrong exits
I'm not the people you should be upset with
I don't mean no harm baby and I'm not sexist

A gangsta still fightin charges but he totes that Glock
Like a junkie with a pipe up in the smoke crack spot
I be in every hood, see I knows the block
From Watts to one-fo'-fifth by the clothing shops
Nope, I ain't rockin with them boys I was with
But I'm still blingin and showin off my toys in this bitch
When a real nigga show up hoes switch up they games
Tell us who they really is and give y'all different names
Claimin, she ain't nuttin like them boys be sayin
Shit I'm only tryin to knock the pussy outta the frame
Look here, I tried to chill but they gave me some mills
Me and Mannie back at it, 'bout to get another deal
I got my hand wrapped around the steerin wheel
Hoes like EWWW they can't understand the grill
Skip called me up he got them all on chill
Well let's go and get us some hoes so we can do this heah, y'know",https://genius.com/Juvenile-animal-explicit-lyrics
Sets Go Up (amended version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Wacko)

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at the bitches
And the sets go up 

Hey homie, you don't wanna get familiar with us
Fuckin' over you would give me and my niggas a rush
I'm sick of all you and the fortune and supposed to be thugs
Tellin' stories 'bout your life when that was not how it was
Yeah a nigga did some shit back in the days with the pack
Like in your hood, when you was out there gettin' paid with the crack
You get the fuck when you hear shots and it's not yo' peep
But if a ricochet hit you, you better pop yo' heat
Yeah you know I'm from the 'Nolia but you do not know me
Quit eyeballin' a nigga down 'fore you get shot homie
You don't wanna know what I've been thinkin' up
You better go 'head on and find you another spot to chill
'cause I've been drinkin' cuz
We see a light and everything ain't great
It's like everybody mind is in the same old state, ya know
I'll throw a nigga fucked up with his revenues
I'ma tell you four fuckin' things I'ma never do

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at the bitches
And the sets go up 

From the 3 to the 17, ey yo we doin' it big
If you're ghetto you know who Wacko and Juvenile is
New Orleans, see I'ma rep that, 'cause these my peeps
You could pick up some bad habits hangin' in these streets
Have you talkin' to this and that nigga and showin' your teeth
Walkin' round you like you took care and you handled your beef
Pissed off 'cause your hoe wanna come talk to me
To show me the little gift that she done bought for me
I take it back to when the big timers was pushin' the size
When niggas wore Dickies suits like it was regular jobs
We cop Adidas, ghost town and Anita's used to be packed
And rumors started poppin' and it started to crack
We used to drink Crazy Horse and shoot dice in the back
We had four rules in life and I can promise you that

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at the bitches
And the sets go up 

Now why you muggin' a nigga? Let that bitch go
Let her bounce with a gangsta out six coat
Let her wil' out and flick it off a disco
Let me gas up, dick her down and get ghost
Ain't trickin' for the vagina, I like to get throat
Yo' stupid ass tryin' to stay in here and lick toes
Good girls love G's, that's how the shit go
That's why niggas need to tighten up and get low
I know you heard of *clap-clap*, I'm gettin' doe
Let me check my palm pilot, I'm gettin' hoes
Let me check my squad' wallets, we gettin' close
My squad up in the crowd wilin', they spittin' more
Drive by in the '5-5, forget a '4
Five, five and another five, we get a show
Fifteen and another five, you'll get some blow
You hustlin' your block, pop and you get some more

(One) Never gonna stop tryin' to get it
(Two) Never turn my back on my city
(Three) Never let the money fuck with me
(Four) I'ma never stop hollerin' at these bitches
