Forgot About Dre,2001,1999.0,"Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no skis
Mad at me ‘cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Ho, please!
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales weren't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!
Y'all are gon' keep fuckin' around with me and turn me back to the old me

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say

So what do you say to somebody you hate (What?)
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot 
with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch! Call the cops!
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the 
Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies
Sorry Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him, Hailie (
Dada?
)

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips

Just a bunch of gibberish

If it was up to me, you motherfuckers'd stop
Comin' up to me with your hands out
Lookin' up to me like you want somethin' free
When my last CD was out, you weren't bumpin' me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
‘Cause I'm from the streets of 
C-Compton!
 (
Compton!
)
I told 'em all
All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
‘Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What, ‘cause I been in the lab
With a pen and a pad 
tryin' to get this damn label off?
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque
And fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch

Nowadays, everybody wanna talk
Like they got somethin' to say

Still D.R.E.,2001,1999.0,"Yeah, nigga, we're still fuckin' wit' you
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D.R.E.
'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Huh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Out the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I give you (Still) D.R.E.

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner wit' your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit' your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R, ha-ha",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-still-dre-lyrics

Dr. Dre

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphone first so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nuthin' but a G thang, baby
Two loced out niggas going crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (
Hell yeah
)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (
Yeah
)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk

So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
With a producer who can rap and control 
the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told ya I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn

I Need a Doctor,Detox,2011.0,"I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that
‘Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for ‘em
They just say it's wack — but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin' you
It’s dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
‘Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick; you
Gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic, or you
Gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do
‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It hurts when I see you struggle; you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled, ‘cause the shit I hear is
Crazy, but you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth!
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith
And you ain't givin' up on me — get up, Dre!
I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake! ‘Cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends! All I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers!
When the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots!
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
And ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots!
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards!
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags, and as
I’m leavin', I’ll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don’t leave us like that, man!"" ‘cause—

I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-i-need-a-doctor-lyrics
What’s the Difference,2001,1999.0,"What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes the business end of this shit
Can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still with you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you
And that's just being real with you
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they
(Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta your mouth
And we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute, I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back
(Right) Just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one,
Nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed:
""Whose throat is it?""
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream ""I just don't give a fuck"" and see who means it

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

Medicine Man,Compton,2015.0,"Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
(Yeah, about that…)

Don't let me find out the bitch in you
Don't let me find out the snitch in you

Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders

Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc

Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself

In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the Doctor's orders
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc, turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a Doctor's assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—

Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders, Doctor's orders

Ah, fuck!",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-medicine-man-lyrics
Bitches Ain’t Shit,The Chronic,1992.0,"Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucka with the gangsta beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets
Peep, the shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch, doing the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suing 'cause shit that she be doing ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she taking me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz

Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the streets to Long Beach
Just so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? (Why?) 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now

I once had a bitch named Annie Mae
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
Uh, I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop, we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's my little cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
I'm heartbroke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit

Ooh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I'll let her know that she can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thing (Bitches ain't shit)
Down with the swang (Sing to these hoes)
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal (Bitches ain't shit, Death Row)
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back
Hell yeah, they need to chill (Tell these motherfuckers)
Because I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit), and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck (Tell these motherfuckers)
And now I gotta do some—
I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But when I'm on the dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washer machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the flo', ho (Bitches ain't shit)
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't tryna say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with their nuts hung

Yeah

Mista Busta, where the fuck you at?
Can't scrap a lick, so I know you got your gat
Your dick on hard from fuckin' your road dogs
The hoods you threw up with, niggas you grew up with
Don't even respect your ass
That's why it's time for the doctor to check your ass, nigga
Used to be my homie, used to be my ace
Now I wanna slap the taste out ya mouth
Make ya bow down to the Row
Fuckin' me, now I'm fuckin' you, lil' ho
Oh, don't think I forgot, let you slide
Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stomping on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key
B.G., 'cause you lost all your homie's love
Now call it what you want to
You fucked with me, now it's a must that I fuck with you

You better raise up
Yeah, that's what the fuck I'm talkin' about
We have your mothafuckin' record company surrounded
Put down the candy and let the little boy go
You know what I'm sayin'? Punk motherfucker
We want Eazy! We want Eazy! We want Eazy!

Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
Death Row's in the motherfuckin house
Bow wow wow yippy yo yippy yay
The sounds of a dog brings me to another day
Play with my bone, would ya Timmy?
It seems like you're good for making jokes about your jimmy
Well, here's a jimmy joke about your mama that you might not like
I heard she was a 'Frisco dyke
But fuck your mama, I'm talking about you and me
Toe to toe, Tim M-U-T
Your bark was loud but your bite wasn't vicious
And them rhymes you were kickin' were quite bootylicious
You get with Doggy Dogg? ""Oh, is he crazy?""
With your mama and your daddy hollering ""Baby!""
So won't they let you know
That if you fuck with Dre, nigga, you're fuckin' wit Death Row
And I ain't even swangin' them thangs
I'm hollerin' 187 with my dick in your mouth, biatch

Yeah, nigga, Compton and Long Beach together on this motherfucker
So you wanna pop that shit, get your motherfuckin' cranium cracked, nigga, step on up
Now, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke, so remember the name
Mighty, mighty D-R
Yeah, motherfucker (The shit done hit the fan)

Now understand this, my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's getting fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?) Chip this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gonna creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker (Yeah, nigga)

So I don't want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin' with me (Fuckin' with me)
Yeah, nine-deuce
Dr. Dre droppin' chronic once again
It don't stop
Punishin' punk motherfuckers real quick-like
Compton style, nigga
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, Long Beach is in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, yeah, straight up
Really, though
Breaking all them suckas off something real proper-like
You know what I'm sayin'?

Where you from nigga?
(
Help me!
)

""What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it.""
""Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre.""

I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder
And tell him about his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go
[Chorus: Justus & 
Dr. Dre
]
(
Don't get it fucked up!
) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!
)

Psst! This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific (The Pacific), representin'
Where them sharks at nigga, down in the deep water

Listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
Go fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you 
sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
(Don't get it fucked up!) Naw, nigga!
Now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
(That prescription, yep, yeah, re-up)
That's my nigga, watercolors couldn't even paint the picture
If they don't get the picture, fuck them
Yeah, drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
I'm the one that got they ear
Ah, for many years, I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear: My influence run deep like the ocean
[Chorus: Justus & 
Dr. Dre

(
Don't get it fucked up!
) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(
All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!

Feel's like you're drowning, don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over, shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (If you can't swim, if you can't swim)
Oh my God, where's a lifeguard when you need one?

Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' that with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah, shit! I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents house
(
Don't get it fucked up!
)
 
Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he's no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium
[Chorus: Justus &

Been away from home all night long

I'm drowning
Help me, help me, help me
Somebody help me

Don't wanna lead you on

I got these freaky hoes clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then, they put they mouth on me
Nowadays, a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays, it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said, ""Don't let nobody know""
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin' the ho for four days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mo
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'

Not to give you all of my time that you wanted
You can give me some head, but keep the breakfast in bed

That's the kinda bitch I hate fuckin' with
Baby was a virgin, that's what she said
So I gave her some Hennessy, she gave me some head
I fucked her on the floor so I wouldn't mess up my bed
Then Lil' ½ Dead put his dick on her head
Take that bitch home and give her a bone
And give her the number to my cellular phone
Now she's blowin' up my pager, the shit's gettin' major
A favor for a favor, this dick is what I gave her
Somethin' to go by and bitches know why
Stuff dick in they mouth and then I'm out (See ya!)

Bodies bein' found on Greenleaf

And no, this ain't Aerosmith
It's the motherfuckin' D-R-E from the CPT

No medallions, dreadlocks or black fists
It's just that gangsta glare with gangsta raps
That gangsta shit makes a gangs of snaps, uh
Word to the motherfuckin' streets
And word to these hyped-ass lyrics and dope beats
That I hit you with, that I get you with
As I groove in my four on D's, hittin' the switches
Bitches, relax, while I get my proper swerve on
Bumpin' like a motherfucker, ready to get my serve on
But before I hit the dope spot
Gotta get the chronic, the Rémy Martin and my soda pop
Now I'm smellin' like Indonesia
Bus stop full of fly bitches and skeezers
On my dick 'cause my four on hit
Pancake, front and back, side to side, and all that shit
So when I crawl, I comes correct
Now if your bitch in my shit, it's your bitch you check, nigga
Now let the Chevrolet slide
As I dip and make a trip to the south side, yeah

Rollin' in my six-four
What all the bitches sayin'?

Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Hell yeah)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (What all the motherfuckin' bitches sayin'?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride (Know what I'm sayin'?)
Swing down, sweet chariot, stop and let me ride

Check this out
The sun went down when I hit Slauson
On my way to the strip, now I'm just flossin'
Checkin' my rearview 'cause niggas, they will do
Jack moves, black fools 'cause I smack fools
Tryin' to set me up for a two-eleven
Fuck around and get caught up in a one-eight-seven
But I don't represent no gangbang
Some niggas like lynchin', but I just watch 'em hang
So on and so on, why don't you let me roll on?
I remember back in the days when I used to have to get my stroll on
Didn't nobody wanna speak
Now everybody peepin' out they window when they hear me beatin' up the street
Is it Dre? Is it Dre?
That's what they say every single motherfuckin' day
Yo, but I ain't trippin', I'm just kickin' it
While my D's keep spinnin' and these hoes keep grinnin' I'll be—

Rollin' in my six-four

Darkside/Gone,Compton,2015.0,"Where you at? Where you from?
Whatcha doing over here, motherfucker?
Whatcha think? What you bang?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game

Now I ain't never been no gangsta
But I know niggas, know niggas from the darkside
There's some cold killas, cold killas (My nanny used to tell me)
My nigga used to roll with us, roll with us (Every night)
Married to the more money, more women
Now I ain't ever been the one that'll pull a gun on you
But I know who got 'em
No, I never sold no drugs, homie
But I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me
But I know who got 'em
Mmmmm, heeeey-heeeeeey
If you die tonight, you die tonight
Momma might cry tonight if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you, well, it's just another Friday night
Got a nigga feeling kinda nice
With the Bible right beside that pile of white
That's what this life is like
(Now do you love your life?)

Now please don't give me a reason, reason
'Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
I've been killing the game for seasons, believe him
That I'm the motherfuckin' one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league of my own
You ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get goin'
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong and it's on
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone (Uh-oh)
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
Thirty years in this bitch and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing somethin' right
Word to my nigga Eazy

Eazy-E C-P-T OG from the other side (Eazy)
From the other side (Eazy)


It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been tellin' me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since seventeen
Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object
'Til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm, young and black
Killing them softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We ain't even talkin', fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

You look at my lifestyle
I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fucking with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit that you only can get
On an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still, I got enemies giving me energy
I wanna fight now
Subliminal, sending me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really, no clue, you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then, you hang yourself
'Cause I got the green and gold (With a million sold)
Plus plenty more, (and my dollar thicker)
But with or without the diamonds, though
(To you) I'm just another (Nigga!)

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

You'll find out when I'm gone",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-darkside-gone-lyrics

Murder this, murder listen, hit a suburban whippin'
Tinted windows, right at your wifey (Brrrat!)
And I bet you miss her
Reload the protools and we throw the clip in both trays
That's one on the left and one in the right hand
Scottie Pippen both ways
Been doin' drive-bys, got this music industry timeline
Lookin' like Rosecrans when these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talkin' about that bottom where it's high crimes
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep ‘em thighs high
Sometimes I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, scarier area
I'm very aware hip hop needed somethin' to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
Hangin' way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers and you lookin' like another statistic

There's the stone cold killers in these Compton streets

Ahh, shit! Recognize what lives inside these eyes
I'ma ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodgin' the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counselin', five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family's ties, had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls drippin', silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one way street
Nowhere to go, death all I can see
I say ""Fuck is up?"", I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up or something's up
I hoping all get orthotist, rope it before the double dutch broke
Plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath
My discretion, fuck your blessing, fuck your life
Fuck your hope, fuck your mama
Fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie
Fucked the world up when we came up, that's Compton homie!

Talk About It,Compton,2015.0,"I don't give one fuck
Off the top I wish a nigga would try a nigga
Real shit, y'all counterfeit
Y'all niggas bad business
That's why the game all fucked up
Fuck Glocks, I'm all about Fort Knox, nigga
Ridin' through your neighborhood
Throwin' money out the window like ""What!?""
You about the dollar (You know nothin' 'bout it)
Your poor life been without it
My life in the spotlight
Oh no, no, no, I ain't even got to talk about it, talk about it
Hol' up, if you really 'bout it
Tell these mothafuckas we don't even wanna talk about it, what?

I don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)

I just bought California
Them other states ain't far behind it either
I remember selling instrumentals off a beeper
Millionaire before the headphones or the speakers
I was getting money 'fore the internet
Still got Eminem checks I ain't opened yet
MVP, shit, this is where the trophies at
D-R-E, yeah, this is where the dope is at
The world ain't enough, I want it all
Goddammit, I'm too old, I forgot I got it all
But Andre young enough to still get involved
And Andre still young enough to say fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck you, and you in the corner too
If you wanna beef, make sure that that's somethin' you wanna do
There's some missin' people that felt that way too

I don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day I'mma have everything
It was all a dream... It was all a dream... (I want it all!)

What the fuck was y'all thinking?
You let the wrong young nigga link with a legend
'Lotta new niggas talking crazy on the records
I'm the only king here, you can tell 'em that I said it
I'm the black Eminem, I'm the humbler 50
I'm D.O.C., who do it better? Nobody fuckin' with me
I murder rappers everyday, 'til police come and get me
And Dre just come and bail me out and then we hit the studio
Ain't no new rap in my ear, too many depressed niggas
Emotional every song, deserve to have breast niggas
Crying 'bout my old girl, funny how I left niggas
Trying to get my ex boxed, Red Ring of Death niggas
I'm Kanye raising the diamond on the day of his chaining
If this was you, your diamond wouldn't be worth the appraising
I'm just talking reckless, I'm just off the record
But I mean it, kept my blessings
We was dreaming, now we close enough to see it

I don't know everything, but one thing, one thing I do know
One thing, one thing I do know (I know, I know, I know)
Is one day I'ma have everything
It was all a dream, it was all a dream (I want it all!)

The Watcher,2001,1999.0,"Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OGs in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags: when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost them both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low
 (I'm watching)

I moved out of the hood for good, you blame me?
Niggas aim mainly at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug, how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit, fo'-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes
 (The watcher)

'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I'm watching)

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us, now callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just having fun just watchin' it fly by

Killin' motherfuckers if I have to, peelin' caps too

Who think he just gonna come
And change thangs with the swiftness
So get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission, and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigga maxin' at the top
I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop
Kingpin kickin' back while his workers slang his rocks
Comin' up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
But I got the hook up with somebody
Who knows how to get in contact with him
Hit him like this and like that
Let him know that I'm lookin' for a big fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it

Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face

'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

Creep with me as I crawl through the hood
Maniac, lunatic, call him Snoop Eastwood
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace
And the motherfuckin' punk police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take yo ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre! (What up, Snoop?) Yo, I got the feelin'
Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, and I'm chillin'
Killin', feelin' no remorse
Yeah, so let's go straight to the motherfuckin' source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of time
And now they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock
So, what's up, nigga?
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my motherfuckin' twenty-two
So, if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em, then we struck 'em, so fuck 'em!

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

Six-fo'-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homie belled in the parkin' lot
The scene looked strange and it felt like a setup
Better not be, 'cause if it is, they gettin' lit up!
Oh, here they come from the back in they 'llacs
I'm checkin' for the gats they strap, so what's up, black?
Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gonna come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip
'Cause you can save that shit (Guess what they told me?)
""We give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homie
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh yeah, but you got to sell dope for us.""
Hmmm, let me think about it
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him before I shot it
If you don't quit, yeah, if you don't stop, yeah
I'm lettin' my gat pop, 'cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop!

The Message,2001,1999.0,"This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God

Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen
Listen

If you wan' know why (Why I live my life)
The way that I do (Cause I got to get this money)
So don't worry about me (Cause I know my way around)
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper

You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, 
sometimes I wish I just died with you

While I talk about the pages of my diary, listen up

I remember when I got started my intention was to win
But a lot of shit changed since then
Some old friends became enemies in the quest of victory
But I made a vow, never let this shit get to me
I let it pass, so I consider that part of my history
And I'm strong; financially, physically
Mentally I'm on a whole 'nother level
And don't forget that I came from the ghetto
Sold a new house for my moms, that's special
I let you going shopping 'til your feet get tired
Then a new Benz just for you to ride in
When I didn't have it, you provided
Don't be surprised that I built an enterprise
And my house got a view of the city like a highrise
I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just talking to my diary

When I open up my book, I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

I'm just staring at the sky, you probably thinkin' I'm high
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary

Now puff-puff-pass got a nigga having flashbacks
I remember how it used to be
Now my money like NASDAQ, my checks you can cash that
I remember how it used to be

I used to be a starving artist, so I would never starve an artist
This is my passion, it's where my heart is
It gets the hardest when I think about the dearly departed
Like the nigga I started with
I know Eazy can see me now, looking down through the clouds
And regardless, I know my nigga still proud
It's been a while since we spoke but you still my folks
We used to sit back, laugh and joke
Now I remember when we used to do all-nighters
You in the booth and Cube in the corner writing
Where Ren at? Shout out to my nigga Yella
Damn, I miss that... shit, a nigga having flashbacks

When I open up my book I think about the world later
No ink in the pen, no lines on the paper
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
I'm just, I'm just, I'm just talking to my diary
Sometimes when I got a lot of shit on my mind

I said, ""Darlin', you'd have some walnuts""
She said, ""Well, daddy, if I had some nuts on my chest, would those be chestnuts?"" I said, ""Hell yeah""
She said, ""Well daddy if I had nuts under my chin would those be chin-nuts?""
I said, ""Hell no, bitch, you'd have a dick in your mouth!""

Chicky-check, microphone check one
Chicky-check, microphone check two
Chicky-check, microphone check three
Check game from the notorious Compton G

Back with some shit that gots to bump
As you pull up in the park, you pops your trunk
Just to floss it like a motherfucker, clowning and shit
Got your Dana's on your hooptie and your fly-ass bitch
Throw off, go off, show off, I take that ho
If she proper, I'ma pop her, the ho hopper
Is back on track
With big money, big nuts and a big fat chronic sack

So Daz, step up on they ass
And give these motherfuckers a blast from the past

Diggidy Daz out of the cut with some shit that I wrote
With my nigga D-R-E, so you know I must be dope
But, uh, rat-tat-tat-tat that ass
Starting static with Dre, make way for the AK
That I bring as I slang like cavi
Not from Kris Kross but they call me Mac Daddy
Had he not known about the city I'm from
(Long Beach, tic-tac, grab your gat, watch your back)
Here I come, stomping in my khaki suit
B.G. from the hood, kinfolk Eastwood
God damn, I ripped up, flipped up, and skipped up
On top of things as they swing towards my ding-a-ling

But could you raise up off his nuts?
'Cause Dr. Drizzae's about to rizzip shit up

Chicky-check, microphone check one
Chicky-check, microphone check two
Chicky-check, microphone check three
You're tuned to the sounds of the D-R-E

Now check me out, it's back to the old school
Where the niggas get they scrap on, don't nobody cap on
Slap on some D-R-E
Or some funky-ass shit by the D-O-double-G-Y D-O-double-G
Real G's who drop ki's
Protect these N-U-T's, so nigga please
Peep out my manuscript
You'll see that it's a must I drop gangsta shit (Biatch)
So recognize game from the gangsta
Things will remain the same until I change 'em

It's real easy to see
So you can check sounds from Nate D-O-double-G

Hey you! Sittin over there
Say what?
(You better get up out of your chair)
That's right
(And work your body down)
Yeah
(No time to funk around, cause we gon')
Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me ""Blacula""
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains,
 so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, 
now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber
, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Keep their heads ringin'!

1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes (hoes!) 6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
'Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring-a-ding ding ding dong)
Keep their heads ringin'!

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1"", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
'Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
'Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

All in a Day’s Work,Compton,2015.0,"Fear. Fear's a powerful thing. I mean, it's got a lot of firepower. If you can figure out a way to wrestle that fear to push you from behind rather than to stand in front of you, that's very powerful. I always felt that I had to work harder than the next guy, just to do as well as the next guy. And to do better than the next guy, I had to just kill. And you know, to a certain extent, that's still with me in how I work, you know. I just... go in

Sittin' 'bout a hundred stories up, like what the fuck?
And I'm just lookin' at it all
I'll be right here in Los Angeles, lookin' like a villain layin' low
Nothin' I can do but pack it all up
Goin' up, but shit, I feel the love
Spotlight on me and I'm feelin' so rare tonight
Actin' a fool and feelin' alive
I'm fuckin' flawless like I live in a vault

Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of living I, only type of living I)
Yeah, see, if it was you, you would've killed yourself by now
(Only type of living I, only type of living I know)
It takes a special kind of mothafucka to live like this
(Only type of living I)
And they ask me how I do it
(Only type of living I know)
Mothafucka, just take a look around

Best believe I'm in the buildin'
Ha, I hear you mothafuckas talkin' and all that, but uh
No, no, don't mention me at all
Yeah, comin' live and direct
And I know you feelin' some type of way about it, but uh
Watch your mouth, I dare your ass to say somethin'
I thought it was all good (Hey)
But now you mothafuckas crossed the line and
Kinda pissin' me off
All the fans and all the fame
And though I gave everything to this game, they still complain
Now what the fuck do y'all expect me to do?
There's so much fuckin' pressure
There's so much pressure
And it's all in a day's work

Work, hard
Workin' so hard
24/7, 3-6-5
365, hard work
It's all in a day's work

My whole life, all I ever thought about is grindin'
Even though my surroundings only showed me crime and violence
That was back when a rapper needed guns way more than a stylist
And that was back when I felt like
Rappers was true mothafuckin' riders
Or even back in the day when I was a fuckin' youngster, man
Shit I was still sayin', ""Fuck the police""
(Man, fuck the police)
Born and raised in the belly of the beast
(Mothafuckin' Hub City)
I had a dream that we was at peace
But I was so wrong, so wrong
Y'all too wrapped up in the bullshit and bias
Now reality TV is talking 'bout pulpits and choirs
Some of these hoes give less than a fuck
When they runnin' their life story by us
It's the worst when I'm in a hotel, like a Hilton, sick and tired
And some of these housewives way too fuckin' desperate
These bitches thinkin' fame first
I can't knock the hustle, shit, it's (All in a day's work)
But that's that shit with potential to make the game worse
Shit, it's just somethin' about that Hollywood curse
They just thirsty

Hard times
I double my grind, fuck the part-time
Stay ready for war, I'm on the front line
I'm gettin' the feelin' like it's all mine
It's becoming the only feeling I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I) Only type of livin' I know
(Only type of livin' I know)

Gonna go to work
We gotta work
We gotta work
Let's get back to work
On the grind, back to work
Let's work

Rich as fuck, but, guess what?
I'm back to work (Yeah, I'm back to work)
Overseas, back home, no time to sleep
I'm back to work (Huh, I'm back to work)
So many people that I love, they want my time
But I got to work (I'm sorrry, I'm back to work)
Some of my friends don't understand, shit
I got to work (Huh, I'm back to work)
Always talkin' 'bout bustin' the club
But I'm like, ""Fuck that, I gotta work"" (Fuck that, I'm workin')
If you really wanna do it like this, shit
You better get back to work (I'm workin', huh)
Back to work, right back to work (Right back to work)

Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a Beretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll with my shit off safety

And the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath

(I'm under pressure homie, so much pressure on me)
And my homies on my back
About me helping them get up off them streets

It's kind of funny how they fall back on me
I used to never get a call back, homie
Before the money they didn't see me
Like it's dark and it's all black, homie
But now they switching cause the card black, homie
It wasn't always that way, we was recording on the 4-track, homie
New apartment, no fridge, no mattress, no table, no cable
And all I hear is my girl in my ear
And this nigga Eazy asking for his car back, homie
I would've never saw this happening from that far back, homie
What it came to be, would have never believed
Living the life I lived in C-P-T
A motherfucking dream to reality is what you call that, homie

DJing parties in my neighborhood just for the love
Dope dealers overtipping and bitches stripping
And any minute niggas'll start tripping and start shooting shit
On any given day I'm like ""what the fuck?""
Face down on the pavement with the billy clubs
Took that feeling to the studio and cued it up
And now it's ""Fuck the Police"" all up in the club
Now it's '91 and Snoop Dogg came to visit and was like
""What up cuz? Let me show you what this chronic like""
Couldn't help myself, just had to dip into that chronic life
And then that night came in when that nigga Knight came in
(Woo!) This one of those dreams you don't wake up from
Then again, you don't sleep if you come from where I come from
Where the sun shines and they bust nines, no 9 plus 1-1
When they run up on your school bus with a tool tucked
You might learn something

No matter where we are, no matter what we doing, it's on me

Bullets still ringin', blood on the cement
Black folks grievin', headlines readin'
Tryna pay it no mind, you just livin' your life
Everyone is a witness, everyone got opinions
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't livin' in fear, but I'm holdin' him tight
Got a son of my own, look him right in his eyes
I ain't livin' in fear, but I'm holdin' him tight

Damn, why the fuck are they after me? Maybe 'cause I'm a bastard?
Or maybe cause of the way my hair grow naturally?
Still tryna figure out why the fuck I'm full of rage
I think I noticed this bullshit right around the fifth grade
Paraphernalia in my locker right next to the switchblade
Nothin' but pussy on my mind and some plans of gettin' paid
But I'm a product of the system, raised on government aid
And I knew just how to react when it was time for that raid
Just a young black man from Compton, wonderin', 'who could save us?'
And could barely read the sentences the justice system gave us
So many rental cars with bricks, I think they probably funded Avis
Some of us was imbalanced but some us used our talents, shit
Not all of us criminals but cops be yellin', ""Stay back, nigga!""
We need a little bit of payback (Payback!)
Don't treat me like an animal 'cause all this shit is flammable
Don't fuck around 'cause when it's done, it's done
Fuck you!

And the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane
But you don't know our pain

And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we fuckin' shit up, come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we're all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on

These old sneakers, faded blue jeans, no tricks, no gimmicks
I be stomping down-down-down-down-down demons
Rollin' up trees in the belly of the beast
Where the people disagree
The upper class eat, middle don't exist
The bottom of the beat, glad I got my sticks
Are you jumpin' on a fad, laying in a ditch?
I be stompin' down demons, stompin' down quick, come on

And the old folks tell me it's been goin' on since back in the day
But that don't make it okay
And them white folks tell me all the lootin' and the shootin's insane
But you don't know our pain

And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on
And please don't come around these parts
And tell me that we all a bunch of animals
The only time they wanna turn the cameras on
Is when we're fuckin' shit up, come on

Wake up, jumped out my bed
I'm in a two man cell with my homie 
Lil 1/2 Dead
Murder was the case that they gave me
Dear God, I wonder, can you save me?
I'm only eighteen, so I'm a young buck
It's a riot, if I don't scrap, I'm getting stuck
But that's the life of a G, I guess
Eses way deep, shanked two in the chest
Best run 'cause brothers is dropping quicker
Uh, too late, damn, down goes another nigga
Bouncing off the walls, throwing them dogs
Getting that rep as a young hog
It ain't nothing like the street life
You better be strapped with your shank, 'cause ain't no fist fight
So I guess I gots to handle mine
Since I did the crime, I gots to do my time
[
Chorus: Daz Dillinger

Donny Hathaway

Them say me grow up to be nothing
Look at me now and tell me what you see
I am what I am, it's only me
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

Now I'm holding a dub, sitting on swoll
2
7 years old, up for parole, stroll
I'm back up on my feet 
with my mind on the money
That I'll be making soon as I touch the streets
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump, but now they blast, right
But it ain't no thang to me
'Cause now I'm what they call a loced-assed OG
The little homies from the hood with grip
Are the ones I get with 'cause I'm down to set trip
Nigga, I'm bigger than you, so what you wanna do?
Didn't know he had a twenty-two
Straight sitting behind his back
I grabbed his pockets and then I heard six caps
I fell to the ground with blood on my hands
I didn't understand
How a nigga so young could bust a cap
I used to be the same way back
I guess that's what I get (
For what?
)
For trying to jack the little homies for they grip
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & 
Donny Hathaway
]
Me learn many things from what me see from the street
The outcome of what I've come to be
Little ghetto boy
Playing in the ghetto street
Whatcha gonna do when you grow up
And have to face responsibility?

Something for the real OGs to get with
Some facts, made our made, now you runnin' but don't play
Like every single day, really, though
You know me, I'm the smooth 
macadamien
, gaming them for my homie
No needing being calm if you pack right
And learning just enough to keep your sack right
Late nights, I wonder what they getting for?
Early morning on the corners, what they hitting for?
Seven young G's put they serve down
In a G ride, east side's where they swerve now
Not thinking about what's really going on
Got crept on, stepped on, now they gone
I spent four years in the county with nothing but convicts around me
But now I'm back at the Pound
And we expose ways for the youth to survive
Some think it's wrong but we tend to think it's right
So make all them ends you can make
'Cause when you're broke, you break, check it out
So ain't no need for your mama to trip
'Cause you's a hustlin'-ass youngsta, clocking your grip
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger &

Loose Cannons,Compton,2015.0,"All my life, I've been down to ride
So I kept it real and I stayed alive with no compromise
And I fantasize about the baddest bitch and what between her thighs
Then I woke up and realized this is my motherfuckin' real life

You know where the fuck I'm from
From that muthafuckin' legendary
From the city where them niggas load clips in fast
And get stabbed at homeroom should've skipped that class
Shit will never change on the West Side
Jack your shit, take your car for a test drive (Ah shit)
Gangbangin' out the window hollering let's ride
Gotta keep a tec by the bedside
These niggas don't know my life
All this pain and what I sacrificed
And all my niggas that lost their life
You never die, you never die
I'm in that motherfuckin' one for a minute now
All y'all lil' niggas need to simmer down
Shut the fuck up, I'm the one that's killing now
Take a look who on top of the pinnacle

Cold 187um
Know it's been a minute since you heard from us
Still we're untouchable murderers
R.I.P to KMG, I still got a murder rap
And don't give a fuck where the body at
You do too much talkin' I walk in the building
I just give a fuck where the money at
I'm Jordan and Jackson, the coach and the player
They trust me it's only just one of them
I'm callin' them shots and makin' the plays
If you get a trade, better fuck with him
I keep it gangsta, y'all testin' my patience
Got me feelin' so anxious, I be lookin' so facetious
Feel like running a caper

Wait, hold up I got next! What up, X?

Spent my birthday in Dubai
Skyrise surprise and I'm dressed like a spy
Black tux, on you fucks
And guess what? I'm ready to (blow, yo, oh no)
I hang that 6-2 sideways
Pissin' off the neighbors, scrapin', bumpin' in the driveway
Cube gave me the pistol
Told me to kill at will and (blow, yo, oh no)
(I couldn't give a fuck) Literally
Cashed out just livin' to me
Blast it like a Kennedy beat
Wanna get rid of 'em? Send them to me
While I'm just over here cozy holdin' these double D's
She book smart with pornographic abilities
Well I ,don't know what you know, but I know
I got that shit!
These motherfuckers still talking? Fuck 'em!
That's why they bring X and the guillotine out
To stop these bitch niggas from runnin' their mouth
It's bout time somebody said something

One in the glove, one in the clip, one in the chamber
One on the dash, one in the stash, ready for danger
I'm ready to die, I can't control this fuckin' anger
Ah shit, somebody better fuckin' stop me
Cause I'm a loose cannon that can't stand myself
I'm bad for my own health
You niggas really think I give a fuck about somebody else
(Fuck 'em!)
I swear to God, I'mma do it, back the fuck up, I'mma do it
I swear to God, I'mma lose it

Baby, baby! What the fuck are you doing? Put the gun down! Really? Are you doin' this shit to me again?
Oh my God
You is so fucked up for this
Fuck It

Wait, wait, wait, wait! Okay, I'm sorry! What the fuck? Don't point the fuckin' gun at me! Okay, put the fuckin' gun down! No, no, no, no!!

Alright, I got the legs
Man this bitch is heavy
You gotta get under her armpits, man
Shut the fuck up, I got it
What the, what the fuck did you guys do?
It was this nigga
Me?
Shit, matter of fact you know what? You gon' dig the fuckin' hole this time
I don't give a fuck, like it's the first fuckin' hole I ever dug
Who the fuck is that?
I don't know, ask fuckin' Charles Manson right here
Oh, oh, you're tryna be funny? You're really fuckin' tryna be funny right now?

You don't wanna deal with these fuckin' consequences

Fuckboys should tighten up a whole lot
I got some niggas with me down for runnin' up in your spot
And these niggas got hatchets and ratchets
Some of them lethals up under the mattress
And matter of fact this is a chance to show my lifestyle out to the masses
But chances are I might get another negative reaction
Think I'm a fraction, but I fucks 'em up like battery acid
I gives a fuck what you think, nigga? This is my passion
Survive through the time, you know my name, you know my reputation
You know what it is, I don't need to give no explanation
When you say my fuckin' name, add exclamation
Los Angeles king now, make your bitch bring crowns
To me and Dre, you don't like it, you can lay
Think I'm quiet cause I'm actin', but my bank account gon' say ""Fuck you!""
Respected from SoCal out to the Bay
Cashed a lot of checks this mornin', guess today was a good day

Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers will join the fallen

But this is what the fuck is up, doin' this for my city
Comp-town, Hub, this my fuckin' committee
Shout out to Dub C, real nigga be with me
C-Walkin' on these niggas with a crease in them Dickies
You know how many nights I heard them sparks echo in the park?
Around this time I was spinnin' records at Eve After Dark
My city crazy, school girls used to play with that chalk
Same chalk police used to outline niggas we lost
You understand what I'm sayin'? Shit is crazy, man
Fuck the money, yo this shit could never change me, man
These new niggas in this bitch could never phase me, man
I know it's strange but on some real shit it's plain as day
I’m just havin' some fuckin' fun with this rap shit
Nigga with an attitude, still gettin' active
Man this industry to me, it feels a little plastic
I ain't heard nothin' that I can consider classic, ugh
But this is for my niggas who been runnin' with me
And everybody in this bitch that's out there gunnin' for me
And I got love for my people that stay one hundred with me
I'ma keep it A1, been that way since day one

Now I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
And the sleepers'll join the fallen
(And the sleepers'll join the fallen)
So I lay me down
And wake up to gunshots in this crazy town
Good mornin'
(And the sleepers will join the fallen)

Drama make the city happy
All I think about is makin' classics
Tragic classics for the masses
This how you make a motherfuckin' classic (Classic)

This is where I leave you
Carry you
In the city of Compton

It don't stop, we still mash in hot pursuit from the cops

They call me Hitt 'cause I spit like gats do
Cock me back
Bust caps for my Macz Crew

Blast you, for that set you claim (where you from?)
Mash on you for your Turkish chain,

Don't waste my time
Fuck a scrap in killa Cali, AK's and 9's
One-time's, sun-shines, and fine-ass bitches
Hawaiian Thai,

I was raised in the hood called
 
WHAT-THE-DIF'
Where the brothers in the hood, refused to go Hollywood
Slugs for the fuck of it
Anybody hatin' on us can suck a dick
If I catch you touching mine you catch a flat-line, dead on the floor
Better than yours, driving away gettin' head from a whore
It's 
AvireX-to-the-Z
Fuckin' with me might get you banned from TV
Cassette and CD it's all mine the whole nine the right time
Multiply, we don't die,
 the streets don't lie
What, so neither do I, I'm bad for your health
Like puttin' a pistol up to your face and blastin' yourself

Five in the mornin', burglars at my do'
Glock forty-five in my dresser drawer
Let 'em come in BOW, he see the thunder roll
Roll with niggas, who buy fifths by the fo'
And brews by the case
Slap you in the face with the bass, 
Dr. Dre laced
Likwit Kings with Sedans and gold rings

Soon he'll need antibiotics (Sucka bitch)
Name a sexual disease, she got it like Sam Goody
You be like, ""Damn how could she hit me off with chlamydia?""

To the Hotel, Niko, 
on some Sauve shit like Rico

A high-post ho, a perfect way for me to keep dough
Huh, have her sellin' ass on Bronson Ave. and Pico

At the ho-tel, mo-tel, or the Holiday Inn

I said if that bitch keep fuckin up (Beotch) then we'll fuck her friends
I said I dip, dive, what can I say?

If you blew my balls, right through my drawers
Come back to the mansion, chill at the spot

Gimme some cash, pass it to Daz
Pass it to Snoop, or pass it to Nate

Niggas bringing they ass up in the wrong part of town
Better turn their car around
Rolling the window down (
Hey can we talk it out?
)
(Nah, get the fuck out!)
Johnny got a shotgun
And he ain't even strong enough to cock one
Fuck trying to job hunt
Niggas got AK's
Niggas is way crazier than Dre was back in his N.W.A. days
Niggas spray strays and shoot without looking
Niggas walk by and blast, without leaving a footprint
I think the attitudes are twice as worst
It takes half the time to get your whole life reversed
Always trying to play Rambo with they ammo
Make a nigga wanna stay in family mode

(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

Late nights is full of lead that whistles as it goes by
Murder arrives, anytime
Bullets take flight when the fo'-five ignites
Some hearts skip a beat, some get blew out, and never re-light
With you in the site of youngsters with automatics
Busting on shit to lay everything down even tourists to non-affiliates
These days, gun play is official with green lights on every block
Though the sign tells you too it's not best to stop
On every corner, Cali niggas are dumping
You'll be shaking your soul loose from the box at the coroner's
Making death not so foreign to ya
Niggas got Rugers and M14's with enough ammo to leave
An armored truck Swiss cheese
I've learned to stay away from house parties
I've seen too many go and end up absent without leaving
Ain't no warm welcomings
My eyes have witnessed the bend in on
Nights that don't sleep, and fireworks until dawn

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is
(BANG BANG!!)

Now tell me, what the fuck is this man?
Niggas doing brothers in worse than the Klan
Can't even stand
In front of your building and chill without yielding
Twelve year old children that kill, blood spilling
Thugs be illing, unnecessary slugs filling the sky
Usually drilling the one that wasn't willing to die
Yes sir, in the Killing Field
 I got my life preserver
And I'll do my time for murder
These niggas got the nerve to question me
'Bout the colors that I got on?
I see that red dot on your knot
'Bout to get your whole crew shot on
A Soldier of Fortune,
 I'm the wrong man to plot on
Took him out on the spot before he even got on my hit list
Peep this
I cock back, you bow down
Bust round, bloody the ground
Retaliation sounds like this

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is
(BANG BANG!! BANG BANG!!)
No matter where I go, all I ever seem to see is

Everywhere I go, all I ever seem to hear is

Intro (Compton),Compton,2015.0,"Compton was the American dream. Sunny California with a palm tree in the front yard, the camper, the boat. Temptingly close to the Los Angeles ghetto in the 50's and 60's, it became ""The Black American Dream."" Open housing paved the way as middle-class blacks flooded into the city. Whites don't buy houses in Compton anymore. Now with 74% of the population, black power is the fact of life. From banks to bowling alleys. But the dream that many blacks thought they were buying has turned sour. Though the mayor and four out of five city councilmen are black, they have been unable to solve the problems of crime and growing welfare which is slowing turning suburban Compton into an extension of the black inner city. Crime is now as high as the ghetto. 47 homicides last year gave Compton one of the highest per capita rates in the country. Juvenile gang activity, muggings, small robberies make some blacks want to leave",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-intro-compton-lyrics
The Day the Niggaz Took Over,The Chronic,1992.0,"I'ma say this and I'ma end mine
If you ain't down for the Africans here in the United States
Period, point-blank
If you ain't down for the ones that suffered in South Africa from apartheid and shit
Dammit, you need to step your punk-ass to the side
And let us brothers and us Africans step in
And start puttin' some foot in that ass!

Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die
I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die

Dem wonder why mi violent, dem no really understand
For de reason why mi take mi law in mi own hand
Mi not out for peace and mi not Rodney King
De gun goes click, mi gun goes bang
Dem riot in Compton and dem riot in Long Beach
Dem riot in L.A. 'cause dem no really wanna see
Niggas start to loot and police start to shoot
Lock us down at seven o'clock, barricade us like Beirut
Mi don't show no love 'cause it's us against dem
Dem never, ever love me 'cause it's sport to break dem
And kill, at my own risk, if I may
To lay, to spray with my AK, and put 'em to rest

Yes, we have—there have been riots, ah, uh, rioting
Well, I don't wanna say rioting, but there's been looting downtown
But right now, Bree, what I want to show you is
They have started fires down at the end of the street
[Refrain: All & 
Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg
]
How many niggas are ready to loot?
Yeah, so what you wanna do?
 
What you wanna do?
I said, how many niggas are ready to loot?
Got myself an Uzi and my brother a 9

That's what they told us today, ""In other words, you still a slave""
No matter how much money you got, you still ain't shit!

Sitting in my living room, calm and collected
Feeling that gotta-get-mine perspective
'Cause what I just heard broke me in half
And half the niggas I know, plus the niggas on the Row is bailing
Laugh now, but cry much later
You see, when niggas get together, they get mad 'cause they can't fade us
Like my niggas from South Central, Los Angeles
They found that they couldn't handle us
Bloods, Crips on the same squad
With the Ese's helpin', nigga, it's time to rob and mob
And break the white man off something lovely, biddy-bye-bye
I don't love dem so dem can't love me
Yo, straight puttin' it down, gettin' my scoot on
It's jumping off in Compton so I gots to get my loot on
And come up on me some furniture or somethin'
Got a VCR in the back of my car
That I ganked from the Slauson Swap Meet
And motherfuckers better not try to stop me
'Cause they will see that I can't be stopped
'Cause I'ma cock my Glock and pop 'til they all drop
[Interlude: Reporter & 
Reporter 2
]
Yes, on the videotape we seem to have the, uh
People in the crowd throwing things at the officers
And swinging at them as well
As there was a, uh, young woman there, you see, took a swing at—
At an officer with some object in her hand

I got my finger on the trigger, some niggas wonder why
But livin' in the city, it's do-or-die

One-time trigger happy, no nigga love
One-eighty-seven time, time to grab the glove
Can't get prints on a nine I throw away
Or get prints on my Uzi when it spray
Pop-pop, pop, another motherfucker drop
And I get relief like, 
plop, plop, fizz
Smash, I crashed his head like a window
I ain't Nintendo
, 
I'm high off the indo
Creepin', with the quickness 
to the cut
Bust one to his head while he munches on a donut
And crack-up, so now he best to back up
I guess I gots to pack up, filling the clip up
I zip uptown but motherfuckin' cops are all around
Helicopters flyin', these motherfuckers tryin'
To catch me and stretch me on Death Row
But hell no, the poor blacks refuse to go

This now covers a very, very wide area of Los Angeles where these fires have been, uh, ignited
I mean, from here to the, uh, to the south end of South Central is a long way

Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'
Break 'em off somethin', break 'em off somethin'

The outcome of this is destruction, so them all fall
Niggas don't give a fuck, so them bust and them fall
The description of three blacks
Shows no justice,
 so, pick up it's your right
If you riot again, mi, turn the other cheek
We, be too many, mi got, mi nine to my side
So mi bust, flick, 'cause he don't give a fuck
And mi don't give a fuck
And all my problems end with that buck-buck

Blam, blam, blam 'til dem fall
Listen to the shots from a nigga Doggy Dogg, biddy-bye

Stranded on Death Row,The Chronic,1992.0,"""Yes, it is I,"" says me
And all who agree are more than three 'cause they're we, haha
Yes, yo, I'm in the house now for sure
Because I wanna talk about the hearts of men
Who knows what evil lurks within them?
But let's take a travel down the blindside
And see what we find on this path called

Stranded on death row, so duck when I swing my shit
I get rugged like Rawhead Rex with fat tracks that fits
The gangsta type, what I recite's kinda lethal
Niggas know the flow that I kick, there's no equal
I'm murderin' niggas, yo, and maybe because of the tone I kicks
When I grip the mic and kick shit niggas can't fuck with
So remember I go hardcore and slam
'Nough respect like a sensei,
 
whoop ass like Van Damme
So any nigga that claim they bossin'
Why don't you bring your ass on over to Crenshaw and Slauson?
Take a walk through the hood where we up to no good
Slangin' them things like a real O.G. should
I'm stackin' and mackin' and packin' a ten so
When you're slippin', I slip the clip in, but ain't no set trippin'
'Cause it's Death Row, rollin' like the mafia
Think about whoopin' some ass, but what the fuck stoppin' ya?
Ain't nothin' but a buster
I'm stranded on death row for pumpin' slugs in motherfuckers
Now you know you're outdone, feel the shotgun
Kurupt, inmate, cell block one

No prevention from this lynchin' of sorts
You're a victim from my driveby of thoughts
No extensions, all attempts are to fail
Blinded by the light, it's time you learn braille
From a lunatic, I'm death like arsenic
When I kick a wicked rap, Dr. Dre will hit the scratch
With treachery, my literary form will blast
And totally surpass the norm
Not a storm, plural, make it many storms
When I'm vexed, I fight leg, necks, and arms
In this dimension, I'm the presenter
And the inventor, and the tormentor
Deranged, like the Hillside Strangler
Emcee mangler, tough like Wrangler
I write a rhyme, hard as concrete
Step to the heat and get burned like mesquite
So what you wanna do?
The narrator RBX, cell block two

Rage, lyrical murderer
Stranded on death row and now I'm servin' a
Lifetime sentence, there'll be no repentance
Since it's the life that I choose to lead, I plead guilty
On all counts, let the ball bounce where it may
It's just another clip into my AK
Buck 'em down with my underground tactics
Facts and stacks of clips on my mattress
Bed frame, there's another dead, bang
Laying lame, put to shame, who's to blame?
Me, the Lady of Rage, a woman comin'
From the D-E-A-T-H and R-O-W, takin' no shit
So flip and you're bound to get dropped
It's 1-8-7 on motherfuckers, don't stop
Handcuffed as I bust, there'll be no debate
It's Rage, from cell block H

Ayo, steppin' through the fog and creepin' through the smog
It's the number one nigga from the hood, Doggy Dogg
Making videos, now I stay in Hollywood
Bustin' raps for my snaps, now they call me Eastwood
Dre is the doctor and my homie, little nigga
Warren G is my hand and my hand's on the trigga
Shootin' at the hoes with the game that I got
Sent to death row 'cause I wanted to make a grip from servin' my rocks
And I'm still serving for mine
Peace to my motherfuckin' homies doing time
In the pen and the county jail
Mobbin' with your blues on
, mad as hell
And you're sayin', ""Fuck the police""
And all the homies on the streets is all about peace
And it's driving the cops crazy
But ain't nothin' but a black thing, baby
Uh, I'm not flaggin', but I'm just saggin'
I bet'cha don't wanna see the D-O-double-G
And you can't see the D-R to the E
Or my motherfuckin' homie D.O.C
You know you can't fuck with my motherfuckin' DJ
That's my homie and we call him Warren G
Yeah, and you don't stop
Doggy Dogg break 'em down with the motherfuckin' Dogg Pound
That's the only way we'll beat 'em, man
We gotta smoke 'em then choke 'em like the motherfuckin' Peterman
It's like three and to the two and two and to the one
Cell block four, peace, Doggy Dogg's done

Yo, now you know the path I'm on
You think you're strong?
See if you can travel on
'Cause only the weak will try to speak
Those who are quiet will always cause riots
There's three types of people in the world
Those who don't know what happened
Those who wonder what happened
And people like us from the streets that make things happen",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-stranded-on-death-row-lyrics
Lyrical Gangbang,The Chronic,1992.0,"This should be played at high volume
Preferably in a residential area

Now I'ma kick up dust as I begin to bust
On the wick-wack, fucked up suckers you can't trust
When I kick up, I lick up, your face get smacked up
When I rack up, so all you mothafuckas just pack up
Or get slapped with the swiftness
If you think you're swift with the gift, Merry Christmas
Now stuff that in your stockin'
I'm knockin' 'em out the box and
Knockin' 'em out their socks and 'cause Robin is rockin'
Breakin' 'em down to the slab
Takin' 'em down on their ass
Now what you wanna do? Ya wanna battle? Uh
Send you up shit creek without a motherfuckin' paddle
Rattle that brain, I'm not the same old plain Jane
Roll on you like a boulder, you're nothin' more than a grain
Or a pebble, 
take it from the real rap rebel
Not Bushwick Bill but I can take it to that other level
You think you got pull? Then pull it, uh
I got the trigger so I figure you'll bite the bullet
Then bite the dust and wipe the fuss
Do what I must, and what I must is bust
A bubble or two, some trouble for you
So skip to my Luger, Lady of Rage is comin' through

Some cool shit
Some cool shit
Boo-ya, spittin' out buckshots

I fears no one, I makes 'em cool off like the polar cap
Clenchin' as the hits misses the roller's back
Pushin' packs to make a profit
Diggy dope duck on the topic, so stop and give me my props, kid
I'm livin' large like a fat bitch
So get back, bitch, I'm 
hard to bogart
 so the fact is
This young black kid a mercenary, merciless
Murderin' millions of niggas, so who's first to diss?
They say I'm bad, so you'll find none worse than this
Chewin' motherfuckers up like a Hershey's Kiss
Put to sleep, loving the lyrics I leave in the minds of each
Rough when flex, too complex, wrecks your mental piece
So feel the wrath, nigga, I rip in half, niggas
You're quick to talk shit, I whoop your ass, nigga
Then watch me blast, nigga, 'cause I'm the last nigga
You wanna fuck wit', so up your cash, nigga
I make 'em stagger, I'm scandalous as Jimmy Swaggart
I'm a good tracker, scopin' your girl then watch me tag her
Pullin' steel like a stunt
Shown like an ID card, nigga, no needs to front, so
Here to torment, I put track on crack
And I'm strapped with a semi-tone milli-ten Mac
Yo, I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, chief
Deadly as Jason on 
Friday the 13th

A to the motherfuckin' K

Back in the days, niggas, they use to scrap
But now in '92, niggas, they pull their strap
'Cause, um, police, them come wicked then them shoot niggas
So niggas retaliate and start to loot
Execute
, boot stompin'
Black soldier here to teach and mold ya
The innovator, dominator, narrator
R-B to the motherfuckin' X, flex wicked
Stylee, bump and be found and do bleed by a
Maniac with a gat
See, nowadays, niggas is like that
I pull my trigger back, the bullets go
Buh-buh-buh, now I'm on death row
Fuck it, niggas goin' wild
Every night they shoot, it's like Beirut
Maybe you should get a Kevlar vest for your chest
Anytime steppin' through my hood
But that'll do you no good
One slug to your face, don't hate
You're gettin' smoked like wood
Nasty nigga, bloody pumps, face flat
On the concrete, here comes the white sheet
Mr. Coroner, caught with some yellow tape
But the murderers escape
Audi like five G's

Question is - can I get some? Know what I'm saying?
Ack-rite, bitch
When I see you in the spot, you just act right, you know what I'm saying?
When I yank you by the fuckin' arm
Don't be looking at a nigga crazy
Just give up the digits and be the fuck out, you know what I'm saying?
Let me break it down for y'all

It was just one of those days
When I wanted to catch sunrays
It`s fun to gitt blunted on a Sunday afternoon
Nigga Bathed & got groomed, grabbed the gat for misbehavors
And the chocolate flavored boom, lost in hip-hop tunes
Zoom-zoom like the Commodores
Wonder will we have drama or, end up clowning whores
Round up four good-to-go girls
Like them Barbary Coast girls, riding shotgun, baby
I be postin all-world in the ride
Sipping 151 done gave me too much pride to back down
Soon as we get to The Beach I'mma put my fuckin mack down
I'm playin lead, not the background
It's time to put Bronson on the map now
Walk with my hand on my Johnson, crack a smile
Cuties peep my style, if I don't get some ackrite
I'mma have to ack-wild

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(Aight? And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(Aight? So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Uhhhhh.. drink kicking in, I'm stimulated
For those that don't know big words: I'm FUCKIN FADED
Eighty-three degrees, ease to a shaded spot
Our first spot was cool till some gangsters made it hot
Now we plot and pose
Plus we watchin hoes, with lots of flesh exposed
Getting swarmed by those type of niggas
With no game but brown-nose
So I impose only like pros can
""Yo, is this your man?"" ""No.""
Grab the bitch's hand, ""I'm Hittman.""
Bling! Gold chain gleam
""You're very eligible for my summer league team.""
Maybe too extreme cause the sister got steamed
Then Miss Thing tried to scream on my brethren
I got mad, spit phlegm on the name
Stefan, tattooed on her arm
Ho you ain't the bomb, must be a dyke
Gitcho' lips swoll, or give a nig' some ackrite

Blunt in my left hand, drink in my right
Strap by my waistline, cause niggas don't fight
Sucker free for life, so you better think twice
(And a give a nig' some ackrite)
I'm the type of nigga playa-haters don't like
Snatchin' up your honey for some late night hype
And snobby-ass bitches get slapped out of spite
(So give a nig' some ackrite, right)

Fronting on the ack-rite, causing me to act up
Good Samaritans save that ho from getting slapped up
My homies crack up at the scene I made
Yo my actions ain't serene when a nigga's on fade
If it wasn't for the one-time brigade
I woulda sprayed at the hooker tramp
As cops parade I'm afraid it's time to break camp
Make tracks, where else can we go to take hoes
From fake macks? {*CAR HORN*} Aiyyo, chase them girls
In that black Maxima, the passenger, almost fractured her
Neckbone, looking back at us
Plus, they on the dick cause the Caddy's plush
They blush, I bumrush the huss, with the largest crush
Try to swing an ep tonight so I don't have to keep in touch
Keep it on hush without the tippin`

.. a black man is a pimp
Well let me tell you the biggest pimp
On planet motherfuckin Earth, is her momma
It's her MOMMA that told her
""Get a man that got a good job gurl!
Make sure he got a good car gurl!
Make sure he can take you out and buy you somethin gurl!""

But I'm the pimp motherfucker!
I gotta be the player!
Biggest hoes, on planet Earth..

You KNEW when you got with the nigga he already had a woman
You knew he already had a family
But you fucked him anyway!!!
And then when you thought you gon' lose the nigga
You went and got pregnant - didn't you bitch, DIDN'T YOU!!
THE OL' KEEP A NIGGA BABY
And then when the nigga ain't around, what do you tell the child?
""Aww that nigga ain't shit, that's why yo' daddy ain't here;
Cause that nigga ain't shit.""
How bout bein a woman, and tellin the kid the truth
That yo' momma, you was a ho!
TELL THE KID!
Momma was a ho, I was weekend pussy
I had you to keep the nigga, it didn't work out

Murder Ink,2001,1999.0,"When darkness be closin' in
I motivate, with the howlin' wind
With a list of chosen men, frozen in sin
Knowin' that your end is beginnin', swift silent and deadly
There's no defending my plots, I know your every movement
For six months I watch
Could've got you at your baby's mother's house
Even at your down-low weed spot
But the backdrop, wasn't flattering enough
I didn't want people gathering and stuff ​
Snapshots of blood splattering from the snuff
Here - puff a cig, while I figure which way, to split yo' wig
Right now you as nervous, as a Farmer John pig
As I dig into my tragic bag, take out the HK
Twist on the silencer, insert the 30 shot mag ​
Bullet stuck to his brain like a magnet
Skull in fragments, I leave the cleanup to Dragnet

Peeped all the stash drop and exchange of the dough
Lurkin through the turf, thinkin' how much it's worth
Give 'em chase to the crib and yo he properly laced
Stepped out the car, put my steel, to the side of his face
Murder is the fuckin Case, rob this nigga and shake
The fuckin spot cause in a few it's gon' be crawlin with cops!
Who's the bad bitch now, you crept on, paid the piper
Who'd've thought a sexy bitch could be a murderous sniper
Detrimental to your health, should've learned yo' lesson
But it's too late nigga bye-bye, better count yo' blessings
I been watchin you watchin me, yeah you ballin
Was, nigga now you finger fucked and steady fallin
A thug wit no love, but bitch niggas die fast
Thug niggas die young - oh what you thought you would last?
Blast two shots to the dome, slide back to the pad
And jack my nigga off, til his dick get soft
Resume the wifey boo shit, cause yo my man don't know
That his bitch is straight ill, servin ass with po'-po'

Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

Forty-four reasons come to mind
Why a motherfuckin' brother is hard to find
He been walking on the streets and fuckin' with mine
Stupid punk can't fuck with a mastermind
See, I never take a step on a Compton block
Or L.A. without the AK ready to pop
'Cause them punk motherfuckers in black and white
Ain't the only motherfuckers I gots to fight
I think it's better to be tellin' the facts than cuffed up
And jacked and fucked up
What you niggas looking at? You going
""Goddamn!"" 'Cause it's the city
And for you to survive, a nigga gotta be a gangsta
And I'm a nigga you can't remove
Took out a lot of motherfuckers for tryin' to prove
To they homies that they can hang by dealin' with me
But once again in the end they D-E-A-D
I never did time on a murder yet
'Cause I relax, sit back, do a job and jet
Yo, I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun
Who's the man with the master plan?
A nigga with a motherfuckin' gun

D-R-E, a motherfucker who's known for carrying gats
And kick raps that make snaps, adapts to
Any environment that I'm located at
If you see me on the solo move believe that I'm strapped
Four-four, tray-eight or AK-47
'Cause slowly but surely send you on a stairway to heaven
Just put my finger on the trigger and pull back
And lay a punk motherfucker flat
As he wonder what popped before he got popped
I told you I was Dre and you know it don't stop
Now I know you understand my flow
So here we go, and Death Row
Come let a motherfucker know

Who's the man with the master plan?

I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah
I breaks 'em off, I breaks 'em off, yeah

I breaks 'em off, but I ain't speaking about between the thighs
I'm talking about cocking a gauge in between your eyes
It'll make you drop to your knees 'cause you realize
That a gat'll make any nigga civilized
Old buster-ass nigga talking bullshit
Don't know that I'm the wrong nigga to fuck with
Get lit or hit up by the doctor
A nigga that breaks 'em off properly
Real G so don't doubt it
I'm the one who's doin' it while these other niggas talk about it
And if motherfuckers come at me wrong
I straight put my forty-four Desert Eagle to his motherfuckin' dome
And show him why they call me the notorious one
The name is Dre Eastwood when I'm packing a gun
You don't believe me, well step up and give it a try
And if you die, you's a buster, 'cause real niggas don't die
But some still don't hear me, though
You're too near me not to hear me, nigga, yo

Hell yeah, still always into something
Heart still in Compton
The comp can't oppose, dope Cali platinum classicals
Introduced you to my Doggs, that don't love hoes
And Firm Fiascoes
—assholes
Fucked you up with my last video, tuxed up
Doing a tango
And cash, always in my grasp
Came up in the game wearin' khakis not kangols,
 
stranglin' hoes
When asked about it in most interviews I just laugh
Now I vacate with hoes with a gang of ass
One feedin' me mangoes, the other lightin' my hash
Rap tabloids write Dre's light in the ass (What?)
Came home uptight, ready to mash
Like a gas pedal, 
get on that '64 Chevy level
AK-47 heavy metal

I throw three at you, tell me if you see devils

Chronic, 2000

I hang among hustlers, that slang and Hoo-bang Bronson
When bustaz roll through, can't fuck with my bold crew
We will hold you captive and bust
'Cause gangbangin' is the active, activity
Where I be livin', B, there ain't no Liberty Statue
Hope you got your gat, don't let them catch you
Slippin', without yours, it's warfare outdoors
Ambulance, violent uproars
Trash niggas takin' out like chores
I meet whores on tours
Jeanie`s hot as pepper so I sip, champagne on stormy shores
B on some hardcore, pornographic
Toting Austrian firearms that's made out of plastic
In these drastic surroundings, it be sounding like Lebanon
Makin' fools ""Retreat!"" like Megatron and Starscream
Oh yeah I scream on stars
That get loot then 
crossover like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
Get out your car son, that's how I came to bougie niggas
At 
Bar One

Bad Guys Always Die,Music Inspired By the Motion Picture Wild Wild West ,1999.0,"The Wild, ha-ha
The Wild West
Ha, ride
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & 
Eminem
]
All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun
Ready for the showdown to go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin' gold, waitin' for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's past noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'ma put 30 inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name's Slim, you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too
'Cause when you-

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & 
Eminem
]
He was shady, I seen by the look on his face
He said, ""Take ten paces,"" shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
You need bullets, hurry up, run
I put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want
I figured he was tellin' the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do? It's on you
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?
(The Chronic)
Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it
Who?
Some old dude who's got 26 plaques
And he already sold two
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Dre, here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin'
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well-respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission is to get him to stop layin' eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin' doors in, started gun-slingin'
I could hear somebody singin', it sounded like a ""G Thang""
And a verse from ""Keep Their Heads Ringin'""
I said, ""It's Dre's day,"" and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin' every which way
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
The life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride 'til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad 'cause the bad guys always die
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun

Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistenin'
Vivid on my skin how many continents I’ve visit then

Shittin' on 'em, ya brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it however you want I love it

Pump, pump, my hollow point smacks the clown

"Been There, Done That",Dr. Dre Presents... The Aftermath,1997.0,"I been there, and done that
You got guns? Ayo, I got straps
A million motherfuckers on the planet Earth
Talk that hard bullshit cause that's all they worth

No question, it's all about the D-O-E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryna stick around for Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2G
Since way back, I've been collectin my fee
With the 48 tracks and the M-I-C
Got a palace in the Hills overlookin the sea
It's worth eight, but I only paid five point three
Worldwide, like the triple beam I slide
Listenin to your demo in the stretch limo
Is how I ride, cartel style, vaults stacked to the max now
A million dollar style, niggas wonder how
""Dre Day"" every day
Trips to Montego Bay with more chips than Frito Lay
Floss jewels and attire, ain't nothin' flyer
Straight or illegal, it's still the root of all evil, cause


Young black Rockefeller,
 hella swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin money like a bank teller
Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that you can get
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you, keep it true
Cause most niggas erase hoes that's out for the pesos
My woman's independent, makin dough by the caseloads
I'mma keep buildin', make a killin'
Kick back relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at, you got drama, I got the gat
But we both black, so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private jet, 600 Coupes, then I run Vettes
I'm livin on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill', no sweat, water the lawn with Moet


This is for the millionaires, throw a stack in the air
And watch niggas start plottin, bitches start to stare
Cause game is money, and money is game
And broke niggas make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take they ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around like my 20 inch rims
Moolah y'all, platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin, diamonds shinin, without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass and bounce
Luciano in all amounts, that's all that counts, cause


Uhhh, yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh
That's right, ha
All these people out talkin about who they are, what they got
Heh, it don't even matter
Been there, done that
As long as you true to yourself, gotta be true to yourself
I was always told
If you don't stand for somethin you'll fall for anything, ha ha
Yeah, that's right!
The Aftermath, beatin up on your eardrums
Heh, gotta say whassup to King Tee, and my man Nationowl
They up in here, gotta say whassup to Chris the Glove
G-L-O-V-E, ha ha
Yeah, that's how it goes down, ha ha, yeah, ahh

Drinking on a little bit of that Tanqueray, Tanqueray

Yo Rage, yo run that shit G

Always and forever, forever and always
The rhythm will flow from now and through all days
As long as the sun shines
As long as Eisenhower's on the dime
Yo, I'll be kicking the rhyme
One time for your mind, your soul, your body
The OG's on the side of me
Smooth as E & J, hard as Bacardi
Smacking those yaddy-yacks ducks that keep quacking
Hens that are cackling, end up crackling
Under the heat, the pressure from the one that's deffer
Egyptian ruler, call me Cleo or Nefertiti, yes indeedy
Got the eyes that are beady, body from Tahiti
Voice of the wind lyrics, blow
Chills up your spine I send, so
All thoughts in your mind drop 'em yo
You came in the front but you'll be kicked through the back door
If you try to step, try to come incorrect
Try to play the left, try to start a mess
Try to cause a fuss, try to raise a ruckus
Huh, you'll end up ashes to ashes, dust to dust
A busta, you musta been buggin on drugs
And alcohol back off, all a y'all, up against the wall
Spread em, Doggs - go get em
Hand-cuff em and stuff em, cold shut em, don't let em
Utter a word, not to mother or Herb
If you try you die, visions blurred, speech slurred
Served with a cherry on top

Yeah rock on witcha bad self (Rage)
Rock on witcha bad self (Rage)
Rock on witcha bad self (Rage)
Rock on witcha bad self

Yo, I'm Dat Nigga Daz who packs a tre-8 slug
A true nigga from the hood and the Pound gives love
You see niggas wanna be down but never came around
So back up off my nuts and stop sweating the Pound
You see, niggas get broke off like 1, 2, 3
Cause I'm the D-A to the, D-A- to the Z
Now G'z pay attention to this young ass mack daddy
In a Caddy, had he
Not known about the city where the niggas hang around
So I roll em up, and hit em up with the motherfucking Dogg Pound

I'm rough and rugged, and up to do dirt
I'm from the Dogg Pound nigga so I'm putting in work
I'm no joke, who the fuck you trying to provoke
(1-8-7) It's cold how his ass got smoked
I don't drink no fucking V-S-O-P
I drink a motherfucking O.G. Olde E
I'm from the clique that be kicking the gangsta shit bitch
Real niggas real G'z with real big dicks
I hit em up with the Pound, so what you wanna throw up
Claiming you're cocaine or cavi when you blow up
Know what, the Pound's in the motherfucking house
Back again we try to get high as we can
Dr. Dre, be kicking fat rhymes and produce, and kick shit
I gets more wicked than Beetlejuice
Motherfuckers get battered, so scatter before I keep you
Hostage, a nigga hostile like the grim reaper
So, I'm coming from my hood, what hood
You really like to know, wouldn't you, I thought you knew
Motherfucker don't you know I'm stranded on the Row
I take a look into the crowd kick a style a flow
I'm mashing, motherfuckers get murdered for asking
Relax kid, you're rollin' with a fucking assassin
I last did dirt the other day
Portray, the role of a G, from the D-O double G
P-O-U-N-D, Pound so bow bow motherfuckin' marks
The execution starts, when the Chronic is sparked
I'm like Barkley, rough and rugged, but raw like Rawhead
Rex, I flex murderous rhymes to leave you all dead
What's said is what's said, it's already spoke
The dead is the dead I ain't no fuckin' Joke
I murder motherfuckers as a hobby
One of my idols Ain't No Joke, so why in the fuck should I be
Fly me, to the Bahamas, ruff rhymer, drama's
What you're kicking, wicked is how I'm-a
Approach you, the locster, who's quick to up and smoke you
You're looking like a smoker, grinning like the joker
I yoke you from da back like a bitch talking shit
Cause a bitch ain't shit but a ho and trick, on my dick
Flip, lets take a trip to the Dogg Pound
Fools tried to punk me when I was young, but I'm a hog now
And I gets respect and I step with a Tec 9
Ready to put somethin' up in that ass so you respect mine
Fool, Death Row ain't Lynchin and the Pound ain't Mobbin
We all don't give a fuck, run in your crib and start robbing
Throbbing, I'll break a nigga down in the 90's
Maxing at the Pound wit my doggs is where you'll find me, beeotch

Heell yeaah
You niggas can't fade this shit, you know what I'm saying
Death Row's in the motherfuckin' house
The Dogg Pound's definitely in here, you knowhatI'msayin
And ay yo yo yo yo yo, you niggas can't fUCK with this

Crack that last bottle, I'll kill it with you

Never hurt him, so just desert him
I find it hard to believe that he ain't pullin' your weave
No, I'm kiddin', I'm knowin' my dick is different
He kept his distance, I kept comin' over and stayed persistent
You bitin' your lips, toes twitching and she crinching
Steamin' up the bathroom 'til we left it a sauna
I beat it up and now you usin' my tee as pajamas
Your friends tried to warn you about me, even your mama
But you said you'd deal with the consequence, even if it was karma
But how can I complain when you give me insane brain?
Like you graduated with honors, you probably hate that I'm honest

I hear your phone on vibrate and I know it's him
But that's what happens when that kitty's in the lion's den
You start lying and changing places
You might've been, I might've been too aggressive
But it was far from desperate
I mean, the swag I got, just know it's half the effort
They tryin' to toot my own horn
But, shit, I sworn that I swarmed up in it, stamped and fingerprint it
Left the coupe tinted when you played the passenger
Don't be passing up 'til we finish
What we started, you with it? I'm with it
Then lay your seat way back like it was vintage
While I hit the highway and slowly puff on this spinach
Camouflage emotions got your feelings wide open
I'm hoping you come to grips
At least before you provoke 'em to trip
But that's inevitable, and if I put you on a pedestal
That means I'm fuckin' you on a chair

Tonight, we're gonna get badder (Badder)
You're gonna get wetter (Wetter)

Whatever you want, I'm on that
So don't hesitate, girl, when you lonely
Baby, don't worry, we know that I got you

Now that I got you about they thinking out you
I want to stop and I don't want you to stop that
Ow, we in a phase, oh, I can't wait
Cause waters don't label you, oh, no, no
I'm from, came from the bottom, so just get on top of that
How about with the top back with your top back?

I got his information and went on my way
Went home and realized, shit I'm givin' paper away
Then there's a knock at the door, my brother Warren G
With some niggas out of Long Beach called 213
We started workin' on Deep Cover, said fuck it, we made it
They played it and they played it, got faded and replayed it
They said it's the shit, G funk shit be knockin'
The Row was bouta' drop and it was on and poppin'

In sunshine

What’s The Difference (Unreleased Version),UnKnown,1998.0," x2
What's the difference between me and you

Back when Cube was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils
Got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga
I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you
And that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these crab-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they Ruthless
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
 x2
What's the difference between me and you
You talk a good one
But you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting

The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my rigid stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a Frigidaire
More despair, your style's dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fucking teddy bear
Awh yeah, awh yeah
Is your expression when you eyewitness a session
Vocal pitch making impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid fucker, I will cut ya
Doing a sucka's such a tragedy, I'll run you raggedy like Ann
You'll kick the pink can like a faggoty man
New styles, I usually keep clandestine
Like files of semen found in J. Edgar Hoover's intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, Falana slow mo
When puffing marijuana couldn't get the time of day
Now I'm fucking nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
Hit hard like Singletary
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry


Aight, hold up hold up
Stop the beat a minute
I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fucking weed is in me
(What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dog
I got your motherfucking back (right) just know this shit

Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one nigga
Let's blow this bitch

I mean it dog, you ever need somebody offed - whose throat is it?

Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (hi)
Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up
Mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like 
The Chronic
 was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us
We can start at the penis
Or we can scream
""I Just Don't Give a Fuck,"" and see who means it",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-whats-the-difference-unreleased-version-lyrics
Back To Business,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They've been wondering if I'm gon' show
Shit you already know-ow-ow-ow
Where you been? Where you at? Where you headed?
This shit started to disappear oh no, no
I'm right here, yeah, take this shit right back to the basics
Sound like I'm right back in the basement
Tryna to put my neighborhood on
Six in the morning (Six in the morning)
Until six in the morning (Best believe I'm on it)
Man I'm working so hard
When the check hit the bank, shit, I ain't even notice
I live in the future, I'm blind to the moment
I, I, you ain't gotta stay
Oh you ain't gotta stay around we own it

I remember when I was young just a front runner
I was fucking with them drums like every summer
Homies couldn't make it out the hood, make a nigga wonder
But I couldn't let Compton take a nigga under
No way, no how, can't stop
Had, bigger dreams for this hip-hop
I'm happy, it was music and not Ziplocs
And now we, bringing crowds like it's woodstock
I might as well wipe down the crown I done put up in the attic
I don't play around, lotta niggas coming through the door
Not too many stay around
Lot of artists made it yeah
God damn man I made a sound
Oh you ain't never seen a legend do it?
Hold up homie wait around
I've been on the verge since a nigga put it down
If we talking numbers, fuck Billboard charts
Putting for start with the bank accounts

I've been away
But I think I'm doing better
Anything you do can't impress us
I won't let up on it
What are you gonna say
And I think because they hate us
And the fact that they can't break us
I will never let up
I'm going, yeah I'm going
(Best believe I'm going)
(I'm going) back
It's time to get back to business

This shit realer than rap
Somewhere trapped where you can find me at
Got thirteen in my strap
And I kick it, do it with me whatever town we at
I'm killing these niggas was never feeling these niggas
Went from a million to ten figures I grow
Getting back to the business in the back of a Bentley
I'm thinking damn how far can I go
Well, if my nigga Dre can get a bill
It let me know that there's hope for a nigga still
And many more showing love for my art form
When the ATL the trap shit was on board
Give a raw nigga money when they let me in
If it wasn't for me they would have let me sit
Explanation for all the demolition we did
I'm grinding handling my business nigga

How many miles in the air
One million I'm stacking up this paper
Up up and away-er
One way ticket to the ozone layer
Don't you wanna roll where there ain't no head room
Take it to another atmosphere

Smoke this, smoke this
Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter
Smoke this
Roll it up, roll it up, get a lighter
Another atmosphere
I can change your atmosphere
Get a girl for my Johnson
Roll it up, smoke this
Break it down, roll it up, get a lighter
Smoke this, roll it up, get a lighter
I can change your atmosphere
Smoke this",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-back-to-business-lyrics

It's like clock again, the hood rock again
You should pop it in,ain't take it out
That shit Dre on, you can't make it out
The world ain't set for what I'm about to do
Ninety-six tracks mixed down to two
I stepped out the booth, called up Snoop
Like toucan, Dre got colorful loops

We can shoot, we can scrap
We can rap, we can act
We can mack these bitches, whatever you want
Ol' bitch ass niggas think it's better to front

How it be on the West, forever the hunt

But I won't wear no bull's eye (Bull's eye eye)
Bull's eye is how these fools die (Die die)
Waitin' on school by (By by)
Have you on the news by (By)

Y'all know how the story goes
We give a fuck about award shows

Same shit about hoes

Real niggas own platinum balls
I ain't got it on my neck nigga check my walls
I think y'all just tryin' to insight us
Yo I see how the world can't see these Eastsidaz
All y'all wanna criticize, fuckin' with us tryin' to get a ride
That's when my shit flies

And here's where the pimp lies

I spit game at the globe
First week deuce five

I'd rather be ridin' than walkin'
While all you loud mouth niggas keep talkin'
All you high paid niggas stay fly
I'mma slide left, fly right on by
I'mma do it on the boulevard
Fast bitches, fast cars and stars
Stayin' bossed up eatin' caviar
Lookin' for the next play to have it all, ah nah

It's funny how the game goes
New face but they look like the same hoes
I try to get away, everybody wanna hit of Dre
Stay focused, bang I done hit a day

Nigga fuck what cha' heard, shit is all lies
Niggas mad Dre and Snoop stayin' multi

Fuck y'all, wanna slice and it's all mine

My career in fifth gear while y'all's dyin'

You thinkin' California all sun and surf, for sho'
I can see you walkin' under the Earth

My gun burst em'

And I still got my first mil
Still bounce till I feel like the Earth tilt

Every club, Dre and Snoop loudest
G-Funk, get it crunk like the Dirty South
Hold ya mouth, you ain't worth a third of me

A word from me, exclusive as a surgery
But I don't use a scalpel, chainsaw shoppin'
My fingerprints all over the top ten

Like that

Whole staff'll come through and spin
Either on the film or the two-inch wheel
Behind the wheel of a sixty-four
I can't stop till I done fifty totes

Y'all motherfuckers know me
I smoke a lot of weed, sayin' fuck a pass like Kobe

Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em'
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough

I asked them how much they pay, they said ""nothing"", I was like no money? Someone should get behind fools cause they said there will be at least be 5,000 people.

I got my mind made up, come on; get in, get into it
Let it ride, tonight's the night

Uh, you know you a freak
Before the album went platinum, ya hardly speak
And now you're skin grinnin, gassed off the chrome rims and
Twenty room mansion, I rest my Timb's in
Uhh, I feel it how ya shake it
Rings in ya belly, I can't take it
Toss up your Moët, money make it
Last week frontin, tonight butt naked
I got the flava, make em Zoom-a-zoom
The LL Cool J, give me room
Looked up in my eyes as I lowered the boom
 Twenty thousand freaks packed up in one room, uhh
 x2
All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
(Mmmm, whatchu wanna do) Uhh, whatchu wanna do?

Once again it's on, can't be home
The crime got me in the zone; homies blowin up the celly phone
The world knew I had to come once mo'
And just to let y'all know, I do my thing and still blow
Nuff to burn ten mill' cells, confirmed
The most anticipated since Tyson's return
So come on everybody let's all get down
(LL Cool J: Cause what we have, is a brand new sound)

All the mommies in the house gettin live tonight
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom)
And all my dogs feel the vibe tonight
They wanna (Zoom Zoom Zoom, Zoom Zoom-Zoom)
Say what?

 All I wanna do, is Zoom-a-Zoom Zoom Zoom
 Dre, whatchu wanna do?
 Mr. Smith, it's on you, uh

In other words, it's gon' be like that
You young boys is blind, I'm seein them cats
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry
I'm like a narcotic, niggas is microscopic
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up
You can't get no money battling me; that's like ripping your check up
What partna? Take ten paces and turn around
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin' down (Woooof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make 'em conversate on how real niggas ride my dick
It's like a serum, I just can't hear 'em
All them new niggas poppin' new shit, I never fear 'em
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Work and die

They want the real (Right now!) relax, I got you
Good thing I had a couple hundred tums layin' around

It's Aftermath nigga, you know you heard of us
We're leavin narcotics on every note
We just struttin the streets, like when the Levee broke
I got the antidote
I got ya hands goin up and down, you done fucked up now
But it's hard to go back to that bullshit
And whatever's on the bar, D.R. is gonna push it

You can be my patient (I'm operatin') all night
You can be my patient (Man I'm tryna fuck) all night

I beat that boom boom, down like your knees are
Legs spread out, like I'm mixed in a rebirth

12 Steps to Recovery,Detox,2018.0,"Break out your fuckin' swishas
Light up your fuckin' weed
I'd like to introduce you all to The Chronic III
It's D R period Dre motherfucka
Back to set the record straight for motherfuckers

I gotta be the number one supplier
I keep you higher than Richard Pryor
I been the dope man since '86 ('86)
From a nigga with a attitude to a nigga that's fuckin' rich
I'm feeling better than I've ever been
A lot stronger, plus I got a bet I win (bet I win)
I'm takin' all bets, fuck it I'm all in
And when I'm finished with this business I will be number
(one, one, one)
Started out on the turn tables, but look how the tables turned
You can't imagine what my label earned
I gross more in a year than most niggas make in their whole career
I'm only here (two, two, two) make sure I shake up your rear view
And you niggas could not see me with a clear view
If I was you I'd probably hate me too
'Cause yeah you got a budget but you can't fit Dre in it
It's (three) album solo, the Aftermath logo
Platinum plus 'cause I don't go gold, you know
My stats, ain't got enough wall for all my plaques
Niggas actin' like I wasn't comin' back
(Four) more, I'm too in love with this shit, plus I came too far to quit
And it was in nine (five) I got sick of niggas trippin' and shit
So I started building my label, sometime in 9 (six)
Adjust the levels on my mic so it's loud and clear (testin')
This is something that I want the whole world to hear (world to hear)
(Seven) I'm tired of niggas blamin' sales on the industry
The music ain't shit, and personally it's offendin' me

Twelve steps to recovery

Fuckin' with the D-R, find yourself an E-R
Need C-P-R, do you know who we are?
Love cognac and cigars, so high I don't see y'all
On a whole 'nother level, that's why I couldn't be y'all
(Eight) straight summers they've been patiently waitin'
And I-, I'd like to thank you all for being patient
I-, I'd like to shout out all the critics for hatin'
'Cause you've only been the fuel for my motivation
(Nine) you cat's lives is limited
While I got black cards for all of my businesses
And there's (ten) million reasons why you can't fuck with Detox
And I'm the biggest influence in hip-hop
(Eleven) I can't stop (can't stop), look what I started (thanks to hip-hop)
I get the most pay, because I work the hardest

Red bottoms on a red head
Fake Molly, fed body
We get it poppin' when she at her best
Cause it’s a party when she 'bout it (come on!)
Shots dropping, now she out her dress
And girls coming out the closet (Beats 1!)
A superstar on some private shit

You better open up, let me hit it and join your world
Like the ceiling, reveal it before I kill it
She tried to go tell the city I loved her but no, I didn't
I fucked her no, I didn't, get comfortable doe-eye dipping
Then wonder what she was feeling
Her number does not exist in my phone, and I overlooked her
Her friends were looking me over
And I ain’t got time for nothing
But you to come out them clothes and get naked

She gon' do it all for a player like me
I bet if she could she would make it naughty
You know what she do when she hang around me
She like to get naked

Despite I gotta wife, you the girl of my life
I gotta hit u in the mornin', afternoon and night
I like when you stimulate, all of my feelin's
I like when you light up the scene, when I'm chillin'
If a nigga hold you too long, I'll kill 'em
To you my deepest thoughts I reveala
If you runnin', I loosen the tips then i reseal em
I love you, you love me, ain't no puzzle
And my boo know too, so you know I got you covered
Everytime I hit you girl, it feels like know other
I had to take a deep breathe and reminisce
Heaven must be like this

You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore

I sit alone in my four corner room playin' dreamcast
Hittin' you up inside of steamed glass
It's not your face or your soft act
It's the way you make me feel, and thats way real
Alotta fools talk about you but they don't even know
They ain't hittin' you, they hittin' your kinfolk pretend-o
She smoke suckas out, they pull their duckets out
But she don't have what you worth, dig what I'm talkin bout?
I met you at my uncle Rick James house, he told me you turned me out
And ever since that first hit I can't take you out my mouth
And when I do a press conference, you right with me
When I'm on stage, you right with me
I'll be there for you, cause you be there for me
I care for you, I really hope you care for me

You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore
You the, only, one that I could ever kill fo, I gotta get more
You the, only, one that I could ever live fo, It's you I adore

I carefully flip back the sheets and put you in the middle
Like bread to me, and grab the heat, and put it right to your lips
And blaze you up, now a nigga really feelin' ya shit
Sit in my seat, and try to put a rhyme to this beat
But like a nut, when I'm through with you, I gotta go eat
Fall asleep, wake up in the mornin and you're still next to me
I'm in ecstasy
And you're aroma stuck on my like sex to me
Pretty girl, my wife think I'm crazy
Cause I wake up in the middle of the night to go hit you baby
In the garage, right on the side of the Mercedes
We'd glide, slide, bumpin that Snoop Dogg's latest
I'm really glad to say this

It’s Like That,Detox,2008.0,"Yeaaaah... Aftermath... D.R.E

It ain't too much I haven't seen
Touched or been through
Always on the move so I'm sorry if I offend you
But I got million dollar deals to attend to
Time is money and I don't have a second to lend you
I am the one with the empire to run
West Coast messiah, best known for fire
Throw up your sets loc, the chronic smoke retired
No more lowriders and golden spokes on tires?
SSTOOOP! I just had to detox
Now I'm back on the block like classic Reeboks
As the beat knocks you can put it in the air
Couple of my artists beefing but I wouldn't interfere
My style is innovation, trials and tribulations
You can't rush perfection so thanks for your patience
Got on my troops, assembled in groups ready to shoot
Dressed in bulletproof khaki suits like that...

It's like that, these cats are sick without me
When you need the medicine who they tell you to go see?
Never seen all you looking so lonely
But the Doc's office is open, prescribing you what you need
Got my patients out there waiting, the line is out the door
It's a dose of what you folks have been out there looking for...

It ain't another nigga that can play how I play
Who else can take a longer hiatus, get shot dead
Come back and blow the scene up, sorta like Bombay
You on the road to success but you're going the wrong way
What up Mo, I'm California's own, homegrown
Light up and zone and smoke out till your brains blown
Me and Nate Dogg, on the same song
Now that's something you can definitely bank on
Tell me have you seen a, producer that's meaner
On beats I'm a beast, like Toto Riina
I had my fair share of courtroom subpoenas
Now, trying to live my life a little bit cleaner
Change is what I had to do
I used to be a ruthless nigga with a attitude
Made a lot of dough, then got senses to life on death row
I won my appeal, and drove off on three wheels, like that...


Compton's full of armed thieves and G's that'll do ya
So please don't let the palm trees and cool breeze fool ya
Y'all heard it first here, I've birthed the careers
Of almost every hot rapper in the past 20 years
You would think dudes happily would name a school after me
But instead they see me at events and start attacking me
But my faculty is standing right in back of me
You must like sipping food through a straw like a daiquiri
Come on, man... who you pretending to touch?
When the shit goes down, I don't gotta do much
Buck, poke a hole in him, like a stem in a dutch
We ain't tough nahhh... we just defending what's us
I got a lot to lose, the drop-tops, yachts and jewels
That's why I spot the fool, trying to stop my moves
I'm not takin' losses, I hang with bosses
That can buy anything, like fuck what the cost is
It's like that...",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-its-like-that-lyrics
Not Many Days Left,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah
Not many days left (Bring that shit)

Too much stress can make a nigga hesitate with no time left
(I feel blessed though)
Here we go to the next
A Dr. Dre exclusive with music bruising your neck (What the fuck?)
Rip your plans up, Dre's ruling
You don't want to fuck around with the hands, let alone the gun foolin'
Like De La had niggas plug tunin'
Me and L had niggas zooming, me and Snoop flew the coup
Me keep your asses moving, with that hot shit
Club niggas like to request this around-the-clock shit
But I do it for my (hood niggas)
With rockets
Who learned how to survive and fatten them pockets
With 'x' amount of dollars the ballers, crime pays
But that snake shit'll leave that ass in a pine grave
Rocking project halls, from your sound-proof stalls
Got all you motherfuckers screaming ""Yes yes y'all""

All we need is 40 ounces and a tool to rule
In city duels used to buck fifty fools
Now I let off like white kids in elementary schools
Hit the news like Stacey Koon to Rodney crazy as a looney tune
Kids watch me, bitches jock me for this shit
Cause Hittman's the breaker of the monotony
For a faker man I won't shake your hand
Instead I'll shake like  land on which you stand like maracas in a mariachi band
Got my love back for this shit
Like  Joanie for Chachi now I'm a cocky man again
So I ride like the wind
In a fly Sedan Benz
Hanging out the window when I turn left to watch my rims spin
Ha, that line got my friends grinnin'
The fine bitches got my ends spendin'
The gin got my mind bendin'

17 shells so I make it understood
Stay back, lay back, way back in the cut

I'm right back up in you when you nut

Try to step up and you'll get done, diddy-done

He wasn't shit to me

To the strip

My shit off in ya system attacks
Endo smoke in ya lungs, like that
You get lifted, calm, and if it's da bomb
Taken away like Calgon on Vietnam
California, back and on a mission, makin' a point
Ain't no fuckin' competition
They wishin' but run up on reality

Headed to the liquor store to get myself some drank
Parks my ride as I steps inside, as I puts my 9 double-m to my side
As I (continue with my mission)

To catch as many hoes as I want

And the month's just begun

Now step up like 1-2-3
And give it to the D-R to the E

We straight pussy hounds bitch

You know I like pussy
So you can call me a hound
And here's the name I go by when I'm rolling around

Now I'mma, lay back, stay back, way back in the cut
Until I find a proper bitch to help me bust this nut
Strike, just like a pimp would
Laying dick on a trick in your neighborhood
Should somebody be offended cause of the dick I slang?
Got the bitches stroking my dick like it was cocaine
They loving that nigga they call the Doctor D-R-E
Cause I slangs dick constantly
Now, when you see me in your hood riding by slow
Hitting switches I'm hopping for a ho so
Nigga don't be rolling up on the side of me
Unless you won't your pretty bitch to take a ride with me
And I ain't taking her to her crib I'm taking her to my house
To work that thing and show her what it's all about
And I'mma pop that pussy if I could pop her
D-R-E: the motherfucking Hoe Hopper


Now when they crack 'em I smack 'em right between they lips
It's a daily operation or just an illustration
Of (Niggas like myself who love pussy)
And you can bet every nigga you see with me
Is out hopping, copping hoes like these
Bitches who want to fuck are the bitches that we skeez
Now if you don't want to fuck them don't speak
Yo, continue to mob up them streets
Before the rest of the bitches that can hear me

Turn Me On,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I wish upon a star
Finally, there you are
Dream love
I don’t mean to bother you but I was wondering (Can I turn her on?)
You make the temperature start to rise
Everytime you step into the room, O.M.G

I must be something like an X pill
Bitches start touching themself and singing
(Everything about you turns me)
Everything about you turns me on (on
Wanna fuck you so bad right now)
It could of been the clothes or could of been the way that I'm a rolling stone
Or could of been the scent of a hundred million
Bitches smell when there’s (money in the air, money in the
Money in the air air air)

7 stars must be my aura
A master levitation, I stay up in the clouds
Penthouse hovering a hundred floors up
I’m on some tantric yoga
The ladies love the way I (shine)
I’m like Merlin when I’m erotic
I make you squirm no hands on your body

(Under my control anytime
Anytime I wanna make you hit the dancefloor
You already know what's my name)
So I ain't gotta spell it no more
I did it to the fullest I ain't gotta sell it no more
Tonight I’m looking for my biggest fans
She in the crowd singing my jam

Everything about you
(Everything about you turns me on)

I wanna fuck you
I wanna fuck you so bad right now)",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-turn-me-on-lyrics

Is the hustle that good in
Everybody's city now? Or do they act good?

In school, when you niggas was tradin clothes

Carry my books you ho
I had 'em slavin, yo
I get scarred then I played the ho
Like ""Way to go""

Under the black leather
Platforms, a hat with a feather
I was so naughty, drivin a gold Audi
All we did was throw parties
And show up with Gold Gotti
Handsome, endsome, I'm the one you ran from
Cuz you could only be the man in the shit

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
A lot of fake emcees, punks, and wanksters
R&B niggas wanna G Niggas
I tell you Jam I'm gonna have to go and see niggas
And pay you peasants a visit, my presence up in it
And it won't be no pleasant-able visit
See, I'mma reputable with it, just skeptical with it
I'm professional with it
You get it, you got it, you shoot it, you shot it

Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low

I'm still on top of the game
Still dropping flames, still cock and aim
Still at the top had to rock for the fame
Over setbacks, there's been a lot since I came
You seen it all, how I got, how I gained
The momentum when it dropped, how I got through the pain
When I roll and shock, they watched me reclaim
The streets, they made a special spot for my name
Dre, haters wanna stop to my reign
But the music lives in me, every drop in my veins
The pride and the pain
All the way back from the rise of my name
See the world clear through the eyes of the mane
See the world cheer for the rhymes that I gave
When the beat bangs it'll drive them insane
The eyes that I played, the best to emerge in the game is the Watcher

As soon as your clear in my scope I got you (got you)
Red dot you (red dot you)

Fools can't touch Aftermath we to hot (we to hot)
You can't stop us

With my Glock cocked and call the doctor


I'm Rated R, my brain contains graphics thangs
It turn traumatic teens into addicts, and fiends
It's like, watchin a movie through a panoramic screen
Which means, I can see the whole planet in the scene
Cash is the topic, the object, a fatter pocket
Some take the crack and chop it, but those that haven't got it
Take away the added profit, it's catastrophic
I take the gat and cock it, and I'll sit back and watch it
These New York streets is ugly, I keep it gully
The world is mine and can't nobody keep it from me
Yo, my neighborhood is never sunny
In the place where the number one cause of death is money
You can try copin', I've seen enough shit
To leave your frame of mind broken, I'm still alive and scopin'
Be another hundred years 'til my skies close in

Diagnosis, multiple personality disorder of modern day
With modern tech, jugglin' hard in a Leg' versus manslaughter
I took a swig of the potion and it sent me coastin'
With visions of my Alter-Ego hittin' three wheel motion
""Is it Dre, is it Dre""
No that Ski in a purple 6-tray G.T.A
Killin' any mothafucker walkin'
And all these niggas in these magazines that keep on talkin'
Don't get twisted, 
I been there, I done that
But Ski's out control and maniac
He just show me that he got my back ""I just show him I got your back""
See, in a lot of there, I'm straight
I'm Dr. Dre, but after stroke of mid night
I’m Mr. Ski A.K.A. Dooms Day
Concocted the shit up in my lab
With Mr. Ski up in my head, bringin' on the Aftermath
You can see the stars runnin' from the sky
Tryin' to get away from Dr. Dre and Mr. S-K-I

 the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
 I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
 the Doctor should've told you, Mr. Ski is fatal to your health
 yo, the life style that I'm livin' is just too complex

It's Mr. Ski and Dr. Dre, can't stop this maniacal individual
To start showin' level, with 7.0 on your digital
I'm tryin' to take over shit like Buddy-love
But this professor ain't nutty and he can't do it, any herpe dove
I was the madness that brought on Dre Day
Such this time Dr. Dre, he's the one is gonna pay
I dropped this bud, strain in his brain and shed it off
And have them slangin' guns to them females wouldn't set it off
I do dirt, and tied up his body and break free
Witnesses saw Dr. Dre but it was really Mr. Ski
You might think it's insane, but it's a clever scheme
Dre don't know shit, he wake up in the morning thinkin' it was a dream
Put his ass to sleep and soak his game up
Steady mobbin', hopin' to get this mothafucker brained up
I can't stop till I succeed, then I can break free
No longer Dr. Dre, nigga it's Mr. Ski


I start shakin'
Test tools and bottles start breakin' (*glass crush*)
My Ulti-Eagle starts overtakin'
Instantly spinnin' around like the mass
Tossin' that shit up off like a twister
No longer, the docter or Mister ""Ski""
I can't hold it back
I'm trapped behind the walls of my brains, tryin' to count a rack
""even though tryin' to fight""
My vocal tone ignited into a loud scream ""how high""
It's time to get the fuck up off, yeah

I’m on the loose like 2Pac from Juice
God bless the dead
But I'm already dead from trauma to the head
I'mma verbal Manslaughter on the Mic
Bumpin' in your trunk, shatterin' your glass from the street life
Nobody wants to play with me so I'm drillin' them
I'll be back like Swords nigga, so I can finish killin' them

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex

The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens

Caught in the mix rocking thick chains
From hood to hood ain't shit changed

Tricking the type of loot some cats will try and flip
Wire Tim to overthrow the livest clique
Firm, knowing you'll burn soon as the fire's lit

Yeah, 
Action's Affirmative
Ears open, eyes observing, the number one spot is mine
Permanent
Predict a hit before it drop
It's fire when the  is locked
Sync a beat and keep the streets hot
Seven digits clock mandatory
The most wanted, blunted, low key in a 600
Niggas debate what I roll with
 or presidential, my living standards never fell below

I got a fist full of dollars
(Just for talking that shit)
Rich rap scholars
(Cause we talking that shit)
While we plan to live forever
(Always talking that shit)
You need to get your shit together
(And stop talking that shit)
It's the top of the division

Knock 'em out position

Move it out of the hood
Kids play where we used to piss

Secure the zone
Rattle your bones like Roy Jones
Dr. Frankenrhyme, sparking your mind with microphones
Life with no emotions
Just balance the fake
Keep my poker face, draw quick and shoot from the waist
Make it hot
Put a Boot through your Camp like Buckshot
Coming straight from the bottom of Compton niggas
About to snap like a Vietnam vet in your building
Major flashbacks, finding hard to be civilian


The fact is rich cats give back to The Bridge
From the athletes to the hoes and blow traffickers
I'll do anything to be the man
From competing with fam', hold guns squeeze with either hand
It's like I'm ambidextrous
Somehow stress this
Talk about blowing and knowing the family's restless
How many ways can you correct this?
So at that I exit, I guess it's left to the expert

Besides a mansion is no option
Built a plan since the days of Compton
Kept the plaques from my first apartment
Now I play chess with men that stack capital
 Avenue, rich friends that cage animals
Handle biz with a cool mentality
Pop shit about a war, my account will never see a casualty

Life As An Outlaw,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Dr. Dre:
All you see is the sun, reflecting off of the gun
Ready for the showdown, to go down, at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'ma show you how real cowboys get down
Polish the gold, waiting for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old 45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots to make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sounds of hooves
Sound like a thousand wolves
I cock back, with the toast in the holster and frooze
I pose as a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty
But I'ma put thirty inside and leave early
Just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
Eminem:
You never met me, you'll probably never see me again
But I know you, the name is Slim
You want revenge then don't shoot
I'm in the same boots as you
I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
Life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
Dr. Dre:
He was shady, could see it by the look on his face
He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
The shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
{Eminem: You need bullets, hurry up run}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned
{Eminem: Go ahead shoot me, but I'm not the one you want}
I figured he was telling the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gonna do, it's on you
Eminem:
Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group
{Dre: the Chronic}
Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two
And plus I know who's got it (Who)
Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two
Dr. Dre:
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel
We rode two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun
Eminem:
Dre here's the plot
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's going around saying he took the game from us
{Dre: Let's shoot him in the kneecaps, he'll never see it coming}
He ain't got no legs, they cut them off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission, is to get him to stop laying eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
Dr. Dre:
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swinging doors in, and started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singing
It sounded like a G Thang, and a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing
I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray
It's 1800, he pulls an AK
Hollow tips started flying every which way
Eminem:
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gage
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
Chorus:
Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when your on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
Life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your ride
You ride till there ain't no place to hide

Ride like a cowboy toward the sun
When life ain't fun, when your on the run

Then it got so crunk one minute
Since you didn't get to witness, just listen
I came in hot, and then I saw
As soon as I arrived then the shit popped off
The shit popped off
It's officially a gangsta party
You can leave, man she came to party
Then the shit popped off (Alright)
The shit popped off (Alright)
The shit popped off (Alright)
Said the shit popped off
Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off
Put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off
The shit popped off

Late California night, out chillin' I'm
Bout to fall up in the club we just killin time
Dro blowin', on Patron with a hint of lime
6-4 to the front door with top down
Hit the switches, the ignition, then hopped out
Crew walked in, shut the whole block down
Now, hit the door like ""God damn
Hey is a party, ain't it? Man I don't understand
Why bitches over here, and niggas over there
The atmosphere so square, people so scared
To get up off the wall, and get up off they ass
To walk up on a broad, and get up on her ass""
I commandeer the turntable, that's my first mission
Because the DJ ain't spinnin' he bullshittin'
Go from California Love into Doggystyle
Bought out the bar hours, pulled out the starter now


At the crib in L.A. when the phone ring
Pick it up, it's Dr. Dre, sayin' ""It's on king""
I was on Hen, she was on lean
She was on gin, they all on the beam
Broads talkin' loud, and all talkin' bout
""We tired of sittin' in the house, when we going out?""
""Hey, shut the fuck up for a second, where you at Dre?
Text the address to me homie I'll be on the the way""
I make my way to the closet just for a second
Prepare myself to step into the party for a second
Check it, AKOO hoodie, blue denim, gray fitted cap
Louis rag, hit the stash, grab 50 stacks
I tell them bitches come on, get in the Maybach
57S headed straight to where Dre at
We pulled up to the spot lookin' like whoa
Line wrapped around the corner to the light pole
Latin chicks, black broads, couple white hoes
Who knows where the night might go, hit the door like
Yeah, blinded by the glare of the strobe light
See something I like, it's going down on sight",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-shit-popped-off-lyrics

Too often, is a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryna blossom, got shot down walkin', heh
Bleek a high-to-hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
(*Gunshots*) They done shot my baby!

(Ooh) Pardon Me (ooh) back in the room again
It's time to raise the level of the boom again
(Now who's that?) Bus-A-Bus-A-Bus ra-(*growl*)
See, I ain't do that in a long time
Spit shit, make the streets do more crime
Cop some cribs, top a little more shine
Alright, yeah (Shhh, mmm) I pity y'all
Da way I bang niggas and how I shit on y'all
And spit the slang, big 'em, make your label quit on y'all
And do my thang bitch, from here to Senegal
We gettin' a lotta money, me and my friend Kamal
I take yo money (*spitting sound*) I ain't a friend of y'all *Gunshot*
So much class, my shit'll kill ya, black

And still I'ma smash and make them bitches make it clap
Soon as i'm finished wit' her homie, I'll give her back

So whatchu want me to do?

Smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on
Smoke, smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on

Ya see way back in the days when  was on
I'd wake up in the mornin' just to get my come up on
It was me and my cousin sleepin' in the same bed
Smokin' on the same bud, givin' up that family love
And it wun't no muthafuckin' thang
To push a lil' caine on the side while I gangbanged
That's what my hustle was about
It was 17 niggas in a lil' ass house
Destined, questin' to be on top
We was broke as a muthafucka out to plot
Not, knowin', what's finna pop
I'm sellin' tapes and cavy on the dope spot
Whatever it takes to get it laid
Cause I don't like to dream about gettin' paid
So I guess you could say I'm blessed
So hold a toast to my success
Lets get our smoke on

Smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on
Smoke, smoke, smoke on
Smoke on, smoke on

Another day, another dollar for the S, I guess I'm blessed
Since I'm young and black wit' success it's stress
To a nigga mind sometime, but then again
I think of all the homies stretched in the pen
Doin' time just to get on swole
I ain't forgot about you niggas, shit I'm still on parole
But uh, in the meantime I watch yo' back
Send you some snaps and give ya woman a dope sack
And when ya finally get out the do'
Put yo' mind on yo' money and know whatchu out fo'
Check yo' game and put yo' law down
Ya see, real niggas stay up while punk niggas fall down
It's only right for me to tell you dis
Buy game when it's sold, but I ain't tryna sell you dis
A lil' somethin' from the muthafuckin' Dogg
I'm bought up and caught up, back to the chronic smog

Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D R E, '99 Nigga

Still, still doing that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho', check me out, it's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say, â€½Dre, fell offâ€
How nigga? My last album was 'The Chronic'
(Nigga)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it
If you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police
(Uh, huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
(Fo' sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
(Fo' life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
It's 'Turn Out the Lights' from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D R E
I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still)
Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D R E
It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world, still

I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back
So if you ain't up on thangs
Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeque's every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

Bridgette,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There once was this girl i knew named Bridgette
She asked me was my dick a grown man or a midget
Of course i had to show her all my balls ring ding a ling
I whipped out my whopper but we wasn't at Burger King
Nothing more said she grabbed it like a vice grip
And asked the DOC do you mind if i nibble this
No, i took her to the back of the studio
And, she ate up on the doc like a cheerio
I told the bitch yo please don't bite me
Then she made me scream when she grabbed the balls tightly
So i slapped the bitch for goin out like a sucker
My dick was in her mouth so she bit the mother fucker
To make her stop i pulled up on her extentions
And i left Jimmy standing at attention
The look on my eyes told the bitch she was a goner
Now i look back on the day I should have peed on her
-Chorus-
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was a girl that i screwed but
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
So you know bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She claims she wants to make it up to the DOC
And you know i'm still out to get the pussy
Tried to be nice cuz i didn't wanna diss her
Passed Mickie Dees and went to the Sizzler
Ordered the food, she started rubbin my knee
Then i could tell that she wanted to fuck me
She said Lets skip dinner and i had a fit
At ten dollars a plate i said fuck that shit
Thats the whole reason our relationship was stormy
Why cuz Bridgette was too fuckin horny
She said please excuse me for a minute
To powder my nose i said ya i'm with it
She took a long time the food came and i'm chewin
Thinkin to myself what the fuck is she doin?
Went to look for her and I heard alot of screamin
Looked in a room and the waiters were teamin
Up on the bitch like it ain't no thang
But i flipped cuz it was Bridgette gettin gang-banged
-Chorus-
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was a girl that i screwed but
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
So you know Bridgette called me the next day
Just to apologize so i said ok
She says she wants to come over and see me
And do any thing to fuck the DOC
She said she loves me but i didn't say i love her
Went to the store and bought me some rubbers
Then i made a phone call up to the guys
Boy this bitch is in for a big suprise
When she came in i put on a stone record
Said a few lines and the bitch got naked
Later on the bed i told her to suck my dick
And ran Easy, Cube, and Dre, ran out the closet
Turned her ass over layed the ho on her back
Then we rode the bitch like a mother fuckin Amtrak
Dre had the back and Easy had the front
I'm behind Ice Cube cuz thats where the line started
Bitch gettin dogged bye the DOC and NWA
Dogged the bitch out in each in every way
Thats what I thought but with a girl like Bridgette
The dumb ass ho she liked the shit
(Bridgette) Was a girl that i knew but
( Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) was a girl that i screwed but
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
Yo Dre, you would have screwed the bitch too cuz
(Bridgette was a dumb ho, Bridgette was a dumb ho)
(Bridgette) I'd wear a rubber if i were you cuz yo

Cause when the guns come out they break like kit-kats
But if its beef break me of a piece
I eat that beat that i'm back on the streets
I got a whole lot of bitches to see
And i don't fuck any dub niggas bitches to me
And a bitch is a bitch thats just a simple fact
Next time I'm in town you gonna get me jacked
Send the baby daddy see how the kids react
When the daddy comes home and his ribs is cracked
And he files a lawsuit for a million flat
Fuck it I gotta deal wit that
That's just how it is

But fuck that never mind that shit you did
You tryin' to sell albums I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Game, you gonna respond to Mr. Potato Head
I told I'm just tryin' to feed my kid
Why scoop to a level that requires a shovel
That's like throwing ice cubes at the muthafuckin' devil
I left the group cause the group's too crowded
Now watch Game finish his second album without him

Driving fast 'broads'
With them fast 'chains'

And some charges brought up
With some people they shoot up
Hey, there it goes again
Different face to the same old tragic end
Who's to blame if he never saw it coming
Yet he heard the bullet humming
And he never though of running
It's too late for him now laying out on the ground so cold, so cold
Nothing much to live up to, damn
It's so far gone, so gone
Living in the fast lane
Driving fast broads
With you fast chains
When you pimping through life
See some people got caught up
With some charges brought up
From some people they shoot up
Hey.. tell me when will it end
When the baby pays for its mothers sinning
Trapped inside the four walls of a 'penty'
Way too strong, way too strong
Now she's out in the cold, dying slow and the spoon still warm

It started when they birthed me
Running round stuck in the project now he can't wait to the first come
Little older now and can't wait till the dope come
Sleep all these years and nobody awoke him
Getting it so he can cover the whole border
Question is how many of us can hold water
It seemed like telling is in
Signed states get an order of protection and tell him again
I'm a left lane
My life is much faster than yours
I'm with a chick and its attached to a brawl
Got the air ones matching the car
All white, slinging all night
So we rapidly spar
That's what they want to clap at me for
Understand that the flow is like the coke that he naturally grows
So I'ma get my cash on, and my mash on
And get my ass up out of the fast lane

Rack as the Six Zeros, for those who wanna get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal, rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spread a mill
Small bills, bring a smile to ta Ice grill

Salute with chill Rémy, gently
And escort four ladies an arm to Four Seasons after the club bentley

He sent her to the Sheraton with Thomas
If you need 'em they at 310-629-9755
You hit 'em and they let you know when she's arrived
Oh, she okay, she just runnin' an errand
With this Portuguese dime piece named Karen
Bouncin' through the mall, spottin' 'em all
A sucker for a dick sucker ready to fall
For a daughter like yours
Got him pattin' his pocket and comin' out his drawers
Layin' his jacket on puddles, openin' the doors, all for what?
Because I promised her my name
Gave her the game and still ain't fucked
Just hit me up when you need
Sex, endo and Hennessey
Won't you just put it on me
I just want your company

Put it on me
Relax and come chill with me

If you feelin' froggies then leave when we test you
But I'm guaranteein' you bitches leavin' three less two
Never mind what that love and hate one pairs do
Y'all just snicker at that hooker when we all pass through
Dr. Dre and DJ Quik will probably outlast you
You're like see-through pair of boxers nigga yo ass through
Bitch, you need some good dick, I got that too
Speed bag the clit, leave it black and blue
Time of yo live, I got that boo
Creep late nights up in hotel rooms
We drank, eat shrooms
Kill something, crank the volume
Fuck in every room
You know your home girl want it, Tag team bitch
Why you being dick greedy? Tag team bitch
When she cums, she drips on mattresses
Bedroom time comes I handle shit
Wifey caught up me nigga
That's yo bitch, that's yo biz
That's show biz, that's how hoes is
With or without kids
Long as you keeping it on a hush she ridin' dick
Ain't been satisfied much, she's been fakin'
That's why she callin' me, guess what she's sayin'
Just hit me up when you need

Topless (Original Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"1996, I left it all behind
Cause I ain't got no roof on mine
I had to jump ship, I double back for my
My accountant handle my shit
I never been the losing kind
Grind
I'm feeling like it's year one
I'm a fool anywhere, near square one
But ain't no glass ceilings, I crash through 'em
Ain't no cold spells, I light a match to 'em
Ain't no haters, right, just say congrats to 'em
This is Detox, this rehab to 'em
I bring it back years later, let it flow through 'em
Putting that chronic in their system like I used to do 'em
Respected, so it's proven that's what I been doing
Moving the game like weight and everybody been using
Bitch, it ain't really nothing left to say
You're tuned in to Detox, I'm Dr. Dre

Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
(Pow) Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now

Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab, while mine's glistenin'
Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind
My genetic code make up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time, when night meets day
I'm in the light grey Bugatti like a high speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger, the jumping rope in place
Muhammed Ali hobbies, no Pilates, tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless

(Pow) Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
(Pow) Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine

Get your fifty-thousand dollars fly them AUGs in
Pass them choppers out and see what you niggas rob then
Just let them follow you, like they going to try and do
But bet their brilliant ass don't know their being followed to
Going about your business man
Now all you got to do is introduce the robbing crew to who you gave them choppers to
Then watch tomorrow's news, you'll see a car dude, shot down, laid out, look like the car that was trying to follow you

Do You Ever Think
What Life Would Be
Where You Will Go
After you Die?

Do you ever sit back and get a little too high
Start thinking what happens to you when you die?
Does your soul rest where your coffin is
Or is death just a metamorphosis?
Does life go on in the mental form
If we live a good life will we get reborn?
Is it a heaven or we trapped in hell?
Where do we go from here, nobody came back to tell
If we reincarnated or perish in time
Could you shine when darkness inherits your mind?
And your eyes closed for good, you out the galaxy now
Is this subconscious dream my reality now?
Listen to brain, with no physical frame
Could we return to the hood on a spiritual plane?
Ask yourself, ""If I pass tonight
Am I prepared for what's after life?"" (After you die)

Could we come back, do we get left in the past?
Fuck that, i'ma kick death in the ass
To come walk with the creator, 'til my mind is greater
Get insight so I could design and find data
'Til my third eye gives me a bird's eye view
Focus 'til my ghost is on a curb by you
Watchin you mourn my death, like im lost in time
But im with you even if I don't cross your mind
When you pour out liquor, im catchin the Cognac
When you pull out a spliff im catchin the contact
Try to look after my people, that's trapped in evil
Playin craps and c-low, to get gats and kilos
And still do some of the things that I love to do
Hang on the streets, throw it up in a club or two
See women and catch'em in their wildest dreams
Possess 'em, make'em do the wildest things
And my peeps, what i'ma do, is pray that you blest
And my kids, keep'em away from the angel of death
So just in case if I pass tonight
Yo, im prepared for what's after life. (After you die)

No time to funk around, cause we gon....
Funk, you, right on up
So get up, get a move on, and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck so call me Blackula
As I drain a n****'s jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keepin it real, enables me to make another meal
Still, n****z run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple, so call me Clearasil
I wipe n****z off the face of the Earth since birth
I been a bad n****, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a Stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music flows like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that n**** that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked, once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherf***in D-R-E, will keep their
Motherf***in headz ringin

Five for the hoe, six-seven-eight for Death Row

So I can collect respect, plus a check
Now I fin' to, get into to, my mental will take care of this business I need
To attend to cuz my rent's due
And this rap s***'s my meal ticket
So you goddamn right I'm gonna kick it, or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, runnin n****z over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I kick plenty of a**, so call me an astronaut
As I blast past another n****'s a** that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, n****z know, it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin
The motherf***in D-R-E, will keep their motherf***in headz ringin
Chorus
Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, runnin s*** as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sendin all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the back drop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop N Go
Dre came to wax you so, just call me Mop N Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6-1, 225, a pure chocolate
Your chances of jackin me are slim, G
Cause I rock from summer til Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow

I take ur bitch ass and drop it like it hot
Ur style is messed up and ur flow is wack
The way u be rappin, u must be on crack
Goin against me dawg
Ur ass must be crazy
'cause I lay ur ass to sleep
And then roca bye baby
Ur just an amateur but
Me, im a veteran
After im done with u
U goin need an ambulance
Now let me stop
Take a breath before I really get pissed
On second thought, f**k it im already pissed
Hey yo, this is a lyrical assault on
Anyone who wants some
I knock u out with one verse
Like I'm mike Tyson
Im like a reptile, homie
When I spit, its venom
First, I cripple ur ass
Then I go get em'
U don't want it with me
Trust me when I say so
When I come around bitch
Ur ass better lay low
U walkin with ur bitch
And im like hold up shorty
Look at the way ur man looks
He must be homophobic
Then after a minute or so
She turns at me and
What does she say
Damn ur right, he really does look gay
And that's when u get dumped
Lookin like a prick
While ur bitch is chokin
With her mouth on my dick
Now u can lean back motherf**ker
But I ain't fat joe
Its dre on the hook and
Im killin u hoe
Now before I go
Im goin give u this (middle finger)

Herkesten daha fazla saygınlık kazandım ,Rapin en iyileriyle takıldım
Bunların arasından bana hata yapanların bazılarını affettim
Bazılarıyla tekrar ot içmeye başladık
California desem anlarsınız zaten
Ağzından çıkan yanlış sözler için bile ölenler oluyor burada
Sokaklardaki işlerle bağlantımı kestim artık
Elimde bi tane Beretta silah oldukça sırtım hiç bir yerde yere gelmez
Son zamanlarda benden nefret etmeyi kesmeyen niggalar ve beni alaşağı etmek isteyen orospular için de silahım hazır bekliyorum
Eğer California yerle bir olsa bile ben yine California'da oturup prodüktörlük yapar
Gangsta parçalar üretirdim, biraz nakit para için silahımı ateşlerdim
Çünkü Eazy E'den tutunda The D.O.C'ye, Snoop Dogg'un tayfasına kadar
Herkes bu işe şerefsizlerin arasından sıyrılıp gelerek başladı
Dub-C çetesi gibi zengin olduk, onlar gibi silah tuttuk
Ceplerimiz para doldu, Bu da yaşam tarzamız oldu
Ortamda ot çekeyim derken onu boşa veren bir niggaya ateş et
İşte bu dünya çapında mafya-plak şirketi figürü çizmenin yolu oldu artık, Ciddiyim !
Arabanın hidroliklerini açıyorum, kızlarla 3 lü seks yapıyorum
Fotoğrafçılara poz verirken taşşaklarımı avuçluyorum
Dönüm dönüm arazimlerim var,Lakers'ın maçlarını en önden izliyorum
Yanında tedbir amaçlı ak 47 tüfek taşıyan dostlarımla takılıyoruz

Bu şarkı bizden kendini çok büyük gören herkese gelsin
Biz olmadığımız biri gibi davranmıyoruz , hem ottan parayı kırıp,   Hem de yasal bir şekilde ortalıkta geziyoruz
Kıskananlar çatlamaya devam etsin, biz şampanya içiyoruz ve kızlara sakso çektiriyoruz
Bu işi son model jeeplerimizde yaptırıyoruz
Bu şarkı bizden büyük egoları olanlara gelsin
Başkası gibi davranmadan, hem parayı kırıp hemde yasal bir şekilde suçsuz gezebiliyoruz
Kıskananlar çatlamaya devam etsin, biz şampanya içiyoruz ve kızlara sakso çektiriyoruz
Kızlar bu işi son model Mercedeslerimizde yapıyor


Kendini kabadayı sanan adamlara tokatı basacağım
R&B tarzında giyinen ibneleri azarlayacağım
Zencilerin her perşembe parti verdiği klupte otumu çekeceğim
Etraftaki insanlara aldırmadan, vurmak istediğin adamları sokakta tara
Bu karı kılıklı Jermaine Dupri ve Da brat orospusu herkesi taradıklarını iddia ediyorlar
Tıpkı Dre'nin Rat-a-tat-tat şarkısında bahsettiği gibi
Dostum maalesef ben çirkin kaşarlara ve ezik adamlara karşı sempati besleyemiyorum
Benim kurumsal derecede iş yaptığımı farketmen gerekiyor
California'da doğup, Bronson Bulvarının güneyinde büyümüş olmanın gururunu taşıyorum
Hennessy, bana adam öldürmek için gerekli enerjiyi veriyor
Bana dik dik bak, ben de senin gözünü oyayım
Los angelesin en sert adamıyım ben
Benim yapabileceklerime şahit olmanı istemem hiç
Korumalarının dikkati dağınıkken, ispiyoncu adama yaptığımız gibi
Dostum biz ortalığı fena dağıtıyoruz Hitmann ve Dre derler bize
Oyun mu oynamak istiyorsun ?
Kuralları iyi bildiğinden emin ol önce
Çünkü salakların kafasına silahı dayayıp önce eşyalarını alıyoruz
Sonra kızları alıp Snooty Fox otelde içirdikten sonra grup yapıyoruz
Dostum çetelere sataşmaman gerekir bunu öğren
Aptallıktan başka bir şey değildir bu
Burası Aftermath plak şirketi, buraları biz yönetiyoruz
Bana büyük Hitmann derler, başkalarıyla karıştırmayın beni
Zaten zirvede adımı görmenize çok az kaldı

Bu şarkı bizden kendini çok büyük gören herkese gelsin
Biz olmadığımız biri gibi davranmıyoruz , hem ottan parayı kırıp,   Hem de yasal bir şekilde ortalıkta geziyoruz
Kıskananlar çatlamaya devam etsin, biz şampanya içiyoruz ve kızlara sakso çektiriyoruz
Bu işi son model jeeplerimizde yaptırıyoruz
Bu şarkı bizden büyük egoları olanlara gelsin
Başkası gibi davranmadan, hem parayı kırıp hemde yasal bir şekilde suçsuz gezebiliyoruz
Kıskananlar çatlamaya devam etsin, biz şampanya içiyoruz ve kızlara sakso çektiriyoruz

The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me ass out
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavor
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers
Shorty in down, good Lord
Baby got 'em up open all over town
Strictly biz, she don't play around
Cover much ground, has got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind, what?
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
As long as she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

She's managed by the town

Very low key on the profile
Catchin' villains is a no
Let me tell you how it goes
Curve's the words, spin's the verbs
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You gotta pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time

Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet

Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I be takin' you, so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me and that's how the playettes got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Axe the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is bond, faking moves never been my flava
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy

In other words, it’s gon' be like that
You young boys is blind, I’m seein them cats
Evolutionary (what?) Revolutionary and legendary
I got a climax waiting for each and every cherry
I'm like a narcotic, niggas is microscopic
Dr. Dre and Cool J, is the topic
Forever, my lyrics is rough and energetic
Them cats is blazin? I don't get it, they cosmetic
If shorty wanna step up? I'll twist his neck up
You can’t get no money battling me; that's like ripping your
Check up
What partna? Take ten paces and turn around
That quick, yo' whole ghost town is burnin' down (Woof!)
What I spit, manipulates whole clicks
Make 'em conversate on how real niggas ride my dick
It's like a serum, I just can't hear 'em
All them new niggas poppin' new shit, I never fear 'em
As we proceed
To give you what you need
Satisfaction guaranteed
Break it down!

Housecalls,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hello this is Dr. Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return
Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town
And I was wondering, do you make house calls?
Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything
Stopped the answering service because I knew my phone would ring
Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said hello
It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo

Cuz I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home
It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three
Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery
Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine
But all they had was Thunderbird 1979
So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then
Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said come in
Opened the door to see what I got from this house call
Tall, dark and lovely, 5 ft 8 in a camisole

Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with wavy hair
The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care
So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone
Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone

Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name and number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return
Dre, this is Rene. Do you take American Express?
Dre, this is Alicia. You know what the mood is
Yo Doc, Lonzo, Two jaccuzis free. Bring yo trunks
Yo, it's me again. About those trunks. Forget 'em
Yo Dre man, wassup, huh? Cathy's back in town
Dre, I think (inaudible) knows about us
Say fool, you left ya driving license over here last night
Now I'm a have to whoop yo ass",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-housecalls-lyrics
Been There Done That (LP version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I been there - been there
Done that - done that
You got guns? - we got guns...
Yo, I got straps - we got straps...
A million muthafuckas on the planet Earth talk that hard
Bullshit - 'cause it's all they worth...
No question, it's all about the D - O - E
So if money is the root I want the whole damn tree
Ain't tryin' to stock around for the Illuminati
Got to buy my own island by the year 2 G...
Since way back I've been collecting my fee
With the 48-tracks and the M - I - C
Got a palace in the Hills overlooking the sea
It's worth 8, but I only paid 5 point 3
Worldwide, got the triple beam, I slide
Listenin' to yo demo in a stretch limo
It's how I ride - cartel style
Full, stacked to the max now
A million-dollar smile, people wonder how
'Dre Day' every day. Trips to Montigo Bay
With more chips than Frito Lay
Flossed jewels in a tire, ain't nuthin' fly
Straight or illegal - it's still the root of all evil...
Coz...
(Chorus) x 2
Young black Rockerfeller. Hell, a swiss and mozarella
Pockets sweller, gettin' money like a bank teller
'Cause a fool and his dough soon split
So when you come across a fool get all that she be gettin'
Ladies, get your paper too
Don't expect for no man to support you
Keep it true
'Cause most brothers are raised to decide for the pesos
My woman is independent, makin' dough by the case loads
I'mma keep buildin'... make it killing
Kick back, relax, and grow old with my millions
That's where it's at. You got drama, I got the gat
But we're both black so I don't wanna lay you flat
Instead let's get paper, while it's paper to get
Private Jet, 600 coupes that I runs if...
I'm livin' on another level that y'all ain't been yet
Spend a mill, no sweat, water the line with my wet...
(Chorus) x 2
This is for the millionaires
Throw a stack in the air and watch brothers start plottin'
Honeys start to stare
'Cause game is money and money is game
And broke brothers make the 45 flame with no shame
Now many people die over these dead green guys
Ignorance and greed take their ass by surprise
It's the root of all evil and sins
Yet and still it makes the world go around
Like my 20-inch rims...
Moolah y'all
Platinum plaques cover my walls
Grindin', diamonds shinin', and without one flaw
Get the cash, the grass, the ass will bounce
Luciano and all amounts, that's all that counts 'cause...
I been there...
And done that...
Been there, done that...

Still waters run deep

'99, nigga, guess who's back
Still, still doin' that shit, Andre?
Oh for sho'
Yeah
Check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
‘Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it
(If you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Uh-uh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (For sho')
Still got love for the streets, reppin' 213 (For life)
Still the beats bang, still doin' my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed, still

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since ""Turn Off the Lights"" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after mathematics
In the home of drive-by's and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

It ain't nothin' but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're coolin' on the corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name, still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies! Add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs

He's Bionic! (x4)
He's Bionic! He's Bionic! He's Bionic, Bionic, Bionic, Bionic!
He's Bionic! Aaah Bionic! (x2)
Verse 1: Yella
There's no measure of the skills that are in his hands
People ask ""Is he machine or man?""
Positions what he's called or just Dr Dre
People take a look cos he's your future DJ
When he cuts the beat you all will know
Because his records start to smoke and then his turntables glow
If you're a sucka DJ then you'll have a comic
Step to the front if you like embarassment
Chorus:
He's Bionic! Yes!
He's Bionic! So fresh!
*repeat*
Verse 2: Yella
Acquired the skill that you must learn
To become a DJ Doctor, not a grabbin turn
Always seen wit you nurses by his side
And you can bet that the Doctor keeps them satisfied
His supersonic speed is his ace in the hole
Over all the top DJ's, Dr Dre's in control
He operates in LA cos it's the place to be
He's B-I-O-N-I-C
Chorus
Verse 3: Yella
Now as the wheels start burnin and the mixer explodes
The wax from his discs will make you suckas corrode
Radiation level rises to degrees unknown
The circuits overloaded then your speakers are blown
Now ya hear a loud thunder that vibrates the ground
Cos his hands are movin faster than the speed of sound
Everybody runs and they try to avoid
But it's too late cos the place is already destroyed

Dr Dre Let me Ride Türkçe Çeviri (Turkish Translate),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Arabanın içindeyken çok hoş görünüyorsun
Uzun süredir seni süzüyorum ve seninle konuşmak istiyordum ama sanki sen benimle konuşmak istemiyor gibi bakıyorsun
Eee ne yapıyorsun Dre
Onlara ne olup bittiğini göster bakalım

Şehrin ara sokaklarında arabayla turluyoruz Dayton marka jantların üzerinde
Tetiği çekili silah yanımda, çünkü zenciler bundan anlıyor sadece
Bunu söyler söylemez arabamı çalma niyetiyle Tec 9 tutan adamlarla sorun yaşayacağım
Biraz kargaşa çıkarmak istiyor, beni vurmak istiyorsun ha ?
Bir telefon konuşması yapmamla buraya tüm adamlarımı yığarım tıpkı Gotti Çetesi gibi
Sonra tüm Compton Greenleaf Bulvarında cesetleri görür, hem de kafaları kopmuş halde
Orospu çocukları, benim adım Dr Dre
Bu yüzden anlatayım size her günümün nasıl geçtiğini
64 model ful hidrolik impalamda takılırken
Ve orospulara müziğimi sevdiriyor
Zenginlere kokain satıyor
İspiyoncular için ise mermi stokluyorum
Bu yüzden şimdi yanımdan defolup gider misin ?
Çünkü beni kenara itebilmen için fazla büyüğüm
Hayır bu söz Aerosmith in bu yoldan yürü şarkısına atıf değil
Orospu çocukları benim adım Dr Dre
Comptondan geliyorum,insanları eğlendiren şarkılar yapıyorum ve tam anlamıyla bir Gangstayım
En iyi şarkıları yaparken sen geriye çekil, otu iç ve kafayı çek
Bende mermileri ateşlemeye başlayacağım
Eğer buna rağmen kargaşa son bulmazsa
Arabayı geriye doğru sürüp
Kalacak başka bir yer bulmam lazım

64 model impalamda takılırken...
Bütün zencilerin düşündüğü tek şey..
Bir aşağı bir yukarı sallanan güzel araba
Hidroliklerini indir, köşede dur ve bizi de al (X4)

Her yeni birgün Dre için şöyle başlar
Madalyon takmadan, saçlarımıza rasta yaptırmadan muşta kullanmadan (Afrikan sembolleri kullanmadan )
Bizimkisi sadece bir Gangsta ışıltısı
Bu tam bir Gangsta işi, parayı kırma yolu
(Yaşadığımız sokaklar hakkında konuşuyoruz )
Ayrıca bu öfke dolu sözler ve mükemmle beatlerle haykırıyoruz içimizdekileri
Sizleri bunlarla kazanıyoruz ,sizleri bunlarla cezbediyoruz
64 model impalamın içindeyken
Hidrolikleri açıyorum, araba yükseliyor
Kızlar biraz rahat olun ben arabayı sürerken
Müzik son ses, sizlere ot ikram etmek için hazırım ama önce bir torbacıya gidip malı almam gerekiyor
Yanında Remy Martin ve biraz da meyveli gazozla
Işte şimdi Endonezya'dan gelen kaliteli ot kokusu almaya başlıyorum
Otobüs durağında bekleyen uyanık kızlar yine benimle olmak istiyor
Çünkü benim Lowrider'in hidrolikleri, arabamı  öne ve geriye sağa ve sola zıplatabiliyor
Ben caddelerde yavaş yavaş takılırken Lowrider'in nasıl sürüleceğini öğretirim
Eğer senin sevgilin benim arabamda ise
Beni suçlama,önce sevgilini kontrol et o senin kaltağın
Şimdi bırakın da Lowrider'im güneye doğru akıp gitsin hidroliklerim arabamı zıplatıp indirirken

64 model impalamda takılırken...
Tüm kızların düşündüğü tek şey...
Bir aşağı bir yukarı sallanan güzel araba
Hidroliklerini indir, köşede dur ve bizi de al (X4)

Şimdi beni iyi dinle
Güneş batıyor ben Comptondaki Slauson Bulvarına gelirken
Dikiz aynamı kontrol ediyorum yolumda ilerlerken
Çünkü bazı zenciler beni soymaya çalışabilir
Sizi siyahi aptallar, ben ne zaman bir aptal görsem, tokatlarım
Beni soymak için California'da tuzak kurmayı dene
Ben de sana farklı bir tuzak kurayım sonra, cesedini almaları için cinayet hattını arasınlar
Hayır çete cinayetlerinde cinayet kısmında yer almam ben
Hiç acımadan izlediğim sokakta asılan diğer zenciler gibi olur sonun demek istedim
Buna benzer şeyler falan filan işte
Ya niye bırakmıyorsunuz da günümün tadını çıkarayım
Yürüyerek sokaklarda gezdiğim günleri hatırlıyorum da
Kimse benimle muhatap bile olmazdı
Şimdi ise benim beatimi duyduklarında herkes pencereye çıkıyor
Ve şöyle söylüyor (Hey Dre mi bu çalan, yeni şarkısı mı bu  ? )
Her gün bu kodumun seslerini duyuyorum
Hayır ben sendelemiyorum onları sendeletiyorum
Mahalledeki tüm kızlar benim olmak isterken ve arabam Dayton marka jantların üzerinde giderken
(64 model impalamla takılacağım ve herkesin düşüntüğü tek şey şu olacak)

Ain’t nothing sweet about it
Peep me out

For every mother fucker that dissed me, what y'all hope to gain?
Recognition? You just another broke nigga riffin, so listen
Cause my communication is brief, you in the game?
You got to trim the pork and cut the beef
Indeed we both gotta eat, that's a given
The only difference is, you on the corner, I own acres, I’m livin
We can get down, but I choose to stay around few
And that's Benjamin and Franklin, what this shit boils down to!
Anyway you see it, whether rapping or acting
I took the game to the next level, and you gone see it when I'm absent
What you think I hold is a fraction, cause a niggas mind is simple
The cost of a kilo is sneaker money, and that's what you limited to
Must I prove? Financially, I can call and get Clinton to answer me
Understand me, inside the party with the chronic
I'ma flood the world like Noah til my word be accomplished

Uh I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don’t know what to do when we come after you

Production dealing wide body my dreddys for realer
My sons that come next, they come with the formula
I holds it down because I gots ta
And when you get sick of the bullshit entertainers, call the doctor
(Hey)
Throw a ounce of, straight heat over the counter
When the balls in my court, I stall til the last kick
Brought up and trained to go platinum over plastic
Fruits and fiber stored in my aftermath basket
(Hey)
I took a break to see which niggas was fake
Who was loyal, who was fake, what type of moves would they make
I stayed patient, taking my time like rehabilitation
Good thing I had a strong foundation
Be on the look out, we bring the flames like cookouts
With that hot shit, that got major labels with check books out
Entrepreneur, over-seer, guide my own career
Get on your job, y’all niggas don't wanna pull cards

(Hey, you!)
Don’t make me come back with the..
(One, two!)
Uh, I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don't know what to do when we come for after you
(Hey, you!)
Don't make me come back with the..
(One, two!)
Uh, I thought ya knew, about my whole fucking crew!
(What)
Niggas like you
(What)
Don't know what to do when we come after you",https://genius.com/Dr-dre-hey-you-lyrics
