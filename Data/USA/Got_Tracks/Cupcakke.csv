Pubic hair got inches, that's weave on the dick
Pussy like a tree, it got leaves on the shit
Bang bang this pussy, Chief Keef with the dick
Climbing on that dick, need a 10 feet ladder
I love the D, that's my favorite letter
My nudes in your phone, takin' up your data
My cakes got fatter by usin' cum as the batter
Look down to your dick and tell him I won't disappoint it
Pussy on punishment if she miss a dick appointment
Sloppy toppy for papi, leave sloppy Joe shook
I only call you Captain, 'cause your dick is off the hook

I can make your dick stand up (are you ready?)
Like Statue of Liberty once we fuck (so hard)

Tap the head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Head of the dick, duck, duck duck goose
Get that dick up and runnin' when he fuck this cooch
Covered in all my cum, the dick be lookin' like a goose

Covered in all my cum, the dick be lookin' like a goose

Twat so wet, you could take a cruise on it
Suckin' yo neck till I leave a bruise on it
Let you eat the pussy, just don't use a spoon on it
Put it in a box like you 'bout to move on it
This that submarine pussy, Mr. Clean pussy
This that I'm 'bout to fuck you longer than the limousine pussy
High self-esteem pussy, it's a dream pussy
If you broke, then the pussy actin' funny like a meme pussy
Easy-Bake Oven and this pussy so similar
Touchin' yo head but ain't checkin' the temperature
Got the dick on lock like a motherfuckin' prisoner
Nut in my pussy hair, that's deep conditioner

Cut the dick off, took it home with me
'Cause any dick that long, it belong with me
This pussy iconic, yeah it moan with me
Put your finger in the hole, come bowl with me
Let me brush your pubic hairs while I suck on your cock
Get all the cum out your dick, make it go out-of-stock
Turn it into a Yeezy shirt when you rip off my top
My box already small, it don't need to be cropped
Turn double-dutch with yo' balls while I'm jumpin' on your dick
Tell your grandma sew my pussy, since you split open my clit
Coochie guaranteed to put you to sleep so damn soon
Ridin' on that dick, I'm readin' Goodnight Moon

Pussy made him scream cause it ain't got thin walls
Pull his dick out the hole of a bagel
Then suck, then get anal while I'm watching cable
Then move and groove slow while I'm nude
Gotta put a bib on when he put the dick between the pool
Cause I drip so much slob on the cock you know
Give you what you want like we on The Oprah Show
Niggas chase to taste but I don't never run
Make that cock disappear that's kidnap cum

Look

Bean bag full of shots different from a bag of Skittles
If shit get bumpy bust it in yo face like a fucking pimple
I need God to answer more prayers so I'm headed to the temple
Bitches sit around on they ass like they done failed cripple
Every convo got a time limit
Cause I dont like to put my mind in it
I don't sympathize with nobody guys
Look me in my eyes and they traumatized
A nigga can't even make me blush
Cause I get more play than Toys R Us
Lay her body out like thin crust so we can chop it up with no Pizza Hut
Waste time on a amateur, give him 31 shots no calendar
I bet he kick back when he heat it make a nigga jump like a cheerleader
Feel it like Peter pushing bitches to the side like Amina
Since I'm the color of a pork and bean
I don't wanna see no cops on the scene
Cause shit could get terrible
So when I move a body or I do a robbery I'm careful
Stained quick you ain't getting shit, money ain't shareable

(He said) Promise me you won't tell
(He said) Just promise me you won't tell
If I take you to the hotel

Things are so intimate I used to be so innocent
Until he touched me in a spot that made me hot
And ever since nothing really made sense
Something was wrong because he had a beard
Even knowing his age it still felt weird
He had a suit and tie instead of pants hanging
He owned his own company not gang banging
It attracted me, loved it was scared to bring him in public
Society would judge worser than Young Thug
The way his pants hugged and attack me
It struck to my core that I liked grown men
Not 1 or 2 years older, man I'm talking about 10
Ran to him for protection to people opinions
Kept coming and coming like an election
He told me ""don't say shit we got to keep it down, erase your call log when my number get dialed""
To get used to it , it really took awhile
Running around town with a pedophile

Brainwashed with what you tell me
What you mean? I was 15 and you play me like R.Kelly
Ready for suicide I'm getting my tubes tied
Don't want another man on me cause I imagine you inside
Refuse to be abused, misused and bruised
You get accused and act confused fuck wrong with this dude?
Bitch ass prick you ain't slick, why me?
Why I have to be the victim you pick?
I was just a sophomore (yeah bitch)
You belong in one room, no windows, one door

Eating that dick for dinner got me cheating on my diet
Ass high in the air like I been fucking the pilot
Swallow his babies so he won't be on Maury trying to deny it
Warning I'm not the type to take home
Got to give me coins to talk just like a payphone
I hit the Mimi on the dick, the shower rod I hang on
And this pussy baldhead like Amber Rose and Grace Jones
Daddy speed up, I'm throwing my knees up
It's so warm in this pussy hotter than a teacup
I'm taking you out yo shell like cracking some peanuts
And sorry you can't titty fuck my little B-cups
I ripped off his tank and then I got spanked
I'm musty ass hell so I know that I stank
If I let you fuck lil nigga say thanks
My blowjobs will make a nigga empty his bank
I make him say ""Ow""! like MJ
I like to pose with a towel like Kim K
Told him eat it, it's organic he call me punta for romantic
Got in my boat and then he sink, I wet that dick like it's Titanic

My vision getting foggy now
Every time he hit this pussy up in doggystyle
My vision getting foggy now
Everytime he hit this pussy up in doggystyle
Yelling out
(Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark)
(Bark, bark, bark, bark)
Swallowing cum, make me

No tricks allowed but definitely gotta treat me
Give me the best dick, no gang bang that's B.D
He playing the 2K so I'm a play with his wee wee
Pussy smaller than that hole in the middle of a CD
Belly rolls wanna play trying to get in my way
The dick swab through my mouth like checking for DNA
Ride it all day everyday like it give Uber a call
Fall off the dick and get back up like Beyoncé Super Bowl
Body turnt to the side like his hat cocked
Been sucking dick for about two hours when I check watch
Brought my friend to the room, he all up on us
Cause we licking dick like Ariana lick the donuts
I got black knees but it's not from being spiritual
I call the dick Freddy Kreuger cause it's fearable
Open your mind I ain't talking 'bout no cereal
Got niggas dying just to get into my Cheerio
Let me bounce on that dick like a trampoline
Coochie wet look like he stuck it in some Vaseline
Baby yo sex feel like fitness no abuse become hitless

No quick head in my bed, I can't have that
I want that long neck, not talking giraffe neck
Ain't no laying down man we 'bout to have late fun
I'm bout' to make your balls stick up like space buns
Want your dick soaked? Place it down my throat
Tongue tickle yo' dick but not telling a joke
Peddle in this pussy, that's how you rock a boat
It get live in this pussy, I'm not talking Periscope
In the sheets I am a bully
Give more head than a hoodie
Every time you make me cum it look just like vanilla pudding
Sit on yo' face all day until you say ""bae it hurt me""
Then I turn around and give the dick more kisses than Hershey's

Yo' dick brick hard like a medal (uhh)
I got 3 holes for it like a pretzel (uhmm)
Tight as a virgin, boy don't get nervous (tight)
I'm here to serve you customer service (right?)
I save dick by giving it CPR (I save dick by giving it CPR, yes)
Put my mouth on it like CPR (let's make porn and watch it on VCR)

I think we should fuck up in every zip code
It would make my pussy wetter than a fishbowl
Pussy a kitty cat, I pet it like a pet
I fuck doggy style so much I need to go to the vet
Hotbox? More like a scorching pussy
Open this coochie up like a fortune cookie
Yo' banana in my mouth, watch my tongue go ape
Yo' dick getting more blows than a birthday cake
When I'm near it, no I don't fear it
Licking on that penis like a letter when I seal it
Today way wetter than my past slob
And if you unemployed I can give you a ass job
Pussy already wet don't need no lube ointment
Dick twisting in my stomach like food poison
That's how you know when you hit the spot
I'll make your pants unzip more than Ziploc

Anything goes when you up in my hole
Dirty panties from the sex, yeah I got me some loads
Listen, I'm the most explicit
Long stick inside my river but we not going fishing
Know what to do every time you have a horrible day
I'll eat that sausage all day like it's Memorial Day
I'm talking barbecue sauce and mustard on it
And the mayonnaise comes when you bust right on it
Name anything freaky and you know I'm 'bout the shit
Only time I'm not on the dick is when I'm 'bout to shit
Pubic hairs all in my mouth, not again
So when I suck yo' dick now I use bobby pins
Who need a gym when you got dick to work you out?
I want my face to lose weight so stroke my mouth
And any time my pussy wanna be hairy like Harry Potter
Becky with the good hair is what you could call her
Let's get it

A little faster
A little more

Niggas get in this pussy and lose in lost and found
Now you wanna act like you starstruck
Pussy woke you up like some Starbucks

Pussy bust open like I'm going in labor
The coochie to the booty it got different flavors
Anytime I wanna make my ass smack on yo cock

If sucking dick was a drug I'm overdosing like Whitney
Drop it in my kitty let me feel it in my kidney

Suck it so good have you shocker than Chaka Khan
Whoa, whoa minute man that's a no no
Buy me gifts than I turn into yo ho ho
What's the rush?  Can I douche or do you want a stank twat?
Pussy dripping on that dick like a raindrop
Wanted the big dick until you made me face it
Dick was so hard it broke my tooth I need braces
How can a nigga ever hate this pussy?
I walk into the barber like, ""Shave this pussy""
I took off my shorts, long story short  (oh yeah)
That nigga ate this pussy
Fuck every hole on my body that's including my ear
Keep my panties when you done as a souvenir
Freakiest girl in the world if you wanna get technical
Don't test me unless it's with your testicles
Taking trips, I'm skinny dippin' and then let's fuck in McDonald's
Caramel Frappe full of cum, boy, you know that's the motto

You bitches ugly and dusty and none of y'all matter
Money all on me, I'm feeling real flattered
Walk in this bitch, straight drippin' like I was tryna get to the toilet, but I couldn't hold bladder
First class only when I'm not on the jet
All the white folks keep breakin' they neck
They tryna see if I'm black and a threat, but I'm covered in green, they like ""Look it's Shrek!""
Bankteller sayin' my shit froze (How?)
Pockets thick as hell like Lizzo (Wow)
Mukbang the beat like Trish, hoe (Damn)
If you piss me off, it's a shit show
'Cause I'mma do some shit that you can't believe
Smack a bitch into Christmas Eve (Uh-huh)
When I fight, I do not pull weave
Only thing I'm pullin' out is teeth
John Wick, the verse I'm not gentle
That mean I'm killing bitches with the pencil (Oh wow)
Shawty better check my credentials, only time I'm getting crossed is at the temple
I'm a whole catch, come fetch me
I'm a drop out, so don't test me (Don't do it)
You got passed around to his bestie, that pussy burnin' niggas like Pepsi
I'mma invest, I bet you'd never catch me waitin' on a man to flip a quarter (I get it on my own)
Niggas so thirsty, fo’ me if I told 'em to, they'd probably drink Flint water
But they can't afford her, I'm up in Georgia, next week Florida, ‘cross the border
Then Aurora, such an explorer, I done been everywhere up on the map like Dora
Max out the card, then I reload it back
Spent ten thousand when I walked in Saks
Body gettin' snatched like a brazillian wax
They hate me 'cause I got what they lack
So they gon' stare, say what you want: I don't care
Bought new jeans I don't wear, cause the ass too fat it's gon' tear if it's on there
I told him, ""Back the fuck up""
Omarion, somebody finna get touched
Bitches talk, but they don't ever do much
I'm grilling niggas 'til they teeth get brushed
Snatched a couple niggas chains in the past, they’ll never come around twice
But if they do, like a cold juice, niggas know to keep it light on the ice
I'm with the gang with it, I bang with it
""Foo foo foo,"" good aim with it
Yeah, I wipe a nigga nose with it
I'm shooting shit like Cole Bennett (Bddah)
Niggas know I'm untouchable, niggas trippin' no Lunchable
And I ain't gotta twerk on ""the Gram"" for a nigga to think that I'm fuckable (Not at all)
I'm always in Dolce & Gabbana (Uh huh)
Everytime I touch down in Bahamas (Uh huh)
I swear to God I don't be caring (Uh huh)
My first name should've been Donna (Uh huh)
I'm just tryna run up some commas (Uh huh)
So you can miss me with the drama (What up?)
And the way that I'm fuckin' these niggas up, I might as well get me a condom
Hoes wanna wake up, do makeup, and don't even know how they look when they baked (Ugly as hell)
Face be lookin' like a bunch of mashed potatoes gettin' smashed on a plate (Hahahaha)
These rap bitches suck and I don't give a fuck about none of the music they make
As long as they watchin' they tone and I'm not talkin' 'bout gettin' tan on a lake
And I swear to God these niggas brazy
Be doin' the most to date me (Get the fuck back)
Be beatin' niggas out they pants
But I still won't call 'em the baby
Nigga took me on a date, then ask me to pay shoulda saw my face when I went in purse
But on the way out, since he act like a bitch, I opened the door for him, ladies first
I don't got time for it, even if they watch said Tom Ford
Bitch, yo' hair ain't full enough
Add another track like an encore
These hoes swear they don't play games
Well, then I'm sorry bro, but you hoes need to learn how to level up
Lil' hoes need to play Mario
I run this shit like cardio
I tell who to guard the door
Gimme my part 'for I rob for more
Runnin' through your crib like the Maury show (Hahahaha)

Underrated but I know they hate it and ain't no debating that I'm elevating
Ever since I made it, niggas that I dated acting aggravated, 'cause I'm fragulated
You send ten bands for a verse back but your verse whack so I got you waiting
And every time I send a verse back, they on thin ice 'cause they know I'm skating
Mad bitches lurking on Instagram, tryna find out where my wealth 'bout

People starving in Haiti
Men nutting in women then disappear for the baby
Promoters acting shady, a bunch of em no Brady
Jail full of our brothers, 'cause fathers was way too lazy
Real struggle been through the trenches
You haven't lived my life
Eat half the can good in the morning
Then eat the other half at night
They don't know about the fighting, they just know 100 likes
I'm just tryna find the light, but this tunnel not too bright
Big money with me, but don't shop at Givenchy
I do not support them stores
Remember times I ain't have a dime
Me and best friend sharing clothes
That's just how the shit go
I don't stop, I just go
All I thought was get it either way
Never cared if I was called a hoe, that was irrelevant
All got skeletons
Feelings not delicate, so just settle it
Brought out the ghetto, now tryna be elegant
Dropped out, but the streets made me intelligent
I done seen it all, so what's new?
Been dogged out my whole life, like Snoop
Niggas love lies, but they hate the truth
I'm only at peace when I'm in the booth
I don't trust none on my Moms
Niggas life scammers and cons
Niggas claim they gotta real bond 'til one get locked up with a bond
Real preach, gotta talk to 'em like a speech
And let a hoe tell anything I say
I'm at her room door it ain't sweet
And I hate my father in the worst way
He forgot more than my birthday
He ain't did shit since the first day
Bird nigga let him chirp away
It's hella times we done got kicked out
Went from the box from living in a big house
Can't forget the days tryna make a way
Walked in the corner store for a discount

We was out there scrapping up quarters
Backpack on the streets, like Dora
Don't look down on others that's shorter
Had mo tears than we had water

What you know about not washing clothes in months?
Or no tissue on the rod if your nose will run?
No pot to shit in, so you hold the dump
The problems we 'bout to face is the goal for Trump
It's over, I ain't talking breakup man
Why every time I need something phone breakup man?
Why loved ones in the ground won't wake up man?
'Cause niggas gang, gang, gang
They wanna shake up hands
That ain't 'bout to make you look cooler
Y'all making mo mistakes than bloopers
Motherfuckers gotta think about they future
These niggas perpetrators like Fuschia
You know me I ain't holding shit in
Real fucked up world that we live in
That twenty dollars for her baby milk
She done took that shit and done went and got a fill in
Becomes repeatable, unbelievable
Now she ain't got custody
I hate it when people so agreeable
Shorty cut it with the fuckery
Dark skin or light skin, you still African-American
Society got y'all fucked up, y'all out here comparing skin
It's a fucking shame ain't shit change
We ain't representing like we should
'Cause it still remain gotta tuck yo chain
When you step a foot up in the hood (or get robbed)
Make a way if you could, make sure yo fam good
Ain't have a door to knock on when I needed help
Just had hope knocking on wood
Old folks intimidated by the generation
'Cause these youngins don't follow obligations
Job application need pronounciation it was too much slang in the conversation
Gotta get professional on the spot, that one shot is all you really got
No Dalmatian fuck one house, I'm tryna own 101 spots

Filter so bright she don't think black glows
That 30-inch weave is to cover her back rolls
It's shocking to you but not to me
People turning insecurities to mockeries
Shit I could be thin or overweight, won't bother me
I'm still choose Burger King over broccoli
I love every inch of my body don't compare me to shawty
Size 7 or 11, I'm a still be a hottie
I dial 0 to the lobby, chop up my steak like karate
Send it up with 10 cups cause I drink pop like a hobby
I'm thinking rooftop party, hell yeah it's 'bout to go up
Till shorty put her finger down her mouth she tryna throw up
So she won't gain weight from listening to the hate
Can't give her food for thought
She'll think her brain gaining weight
Eating disorders, scarier than horrors
She in a buffet and only order a water
Yeah it's that cray, it make you fight yo craves
Stretch marks in a bikini, I'm that damn brave
I used to think model type meant skinny as fuck
Until Ashley Graham came through and started fucking shit up
On cover  after cover with no tummy tuck
Straight served with her curves and got her money up

Reaching for my food is the only time I stretch
Can't you see I love me and I'm feeling my best
Confidence on 10 I can't break like commercials
Try again and again like you in rehearsal
Stripes on my body looking like Tony the Tiger
Shit so fire, everybody inspired
Body of all shapes no difference they all great
I'm eating out the pot if you make me a small plate
You could call me fat or anything under the sun (I don't care)
Afterwards I'm a still go buy a honey bun (Yup)
Idolize the wrong ones, man its clear as day
Go to doctors to get implants but they rent ain't paid
Straight up, fuck dude if he don't like small boobs
Manipulating yo mind like he been to law school
Give him the boot like thigh highs tell that nigga ""bye bye""
Nigga point my flaws out , we bout to play Eye-Spy
I spy a nigga with a big ass head
And we ain't talking about that one between his legs
If you ain't got no ass just hit a couple squats
Ain't no need for a doc to inject butt shots
Don't turn to the media looking for what's hot
They'll steer yo ass wrong like drivers drinking Ciroc
Epic fail on the scale, but she still looking swell

Said he don't do drugs but his tongue in my crack (aye)

Legs boutta spread like Corona'
Piss all in his face he get a boner (Ssss)
Lookin' like the Simpsons now he Homer

He own so many spots, he 101 Dalmation
Yeah, he got a bitch, who give a fuck if he taken?
He about to risk it all, no bracelet
I'm rubbin' on my pussy while he lickin' my tits (yes!)
Dine in the pussy like you at Ruth Chris (yeah!)
I'll make you disappear but I'm creating a bitch
He callin' 9-1-1 reporting his missing dick
And I almost got evicted cause you know my walls tight
Neighbors heard me yelling, ""Daddy fuck me all night!""
50k up in the mall, nah we don't ball like
Designer everything bitch, even my cum Off-White
I suck his dick, he look down telling me I'm great

Bushy ass dick, cut it down on his time
Look down while I ride
Seeing trees like zipline
Ice cubes on nipples, he like to stare at
Ride him so long, said ""Are we there yet?""
His face the throne, that's where my chair at
If his tip lookin' tiny, T.I., I might air that
Bomb bitch like a Lush bath
Throw it the fuck back
Ain't waiting on no dick
Better give me that rush pass
His tongue got to work
I pack that dick in my lunch bag
The pussy thicker than Steve Harvey mustache
Nigga pipe down, let's get this shit understood
Dump through the money, not my asshole

Knocked his balls out the park, now that dick on Tiger Woods

I don't go wherever the wind blow
'Cause if my wig fall off, that's the end ho

Tell a nigga don't talk it, just walk it

Cinnamon Toast Crunch,Ephorize,2018.0,"I was hungry as hell writing this shit
I don't even give no fuck
Let's go

Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch
Cinnamon toast crunch, cinna cinnamon toast crunch (Yo! Yo!)
I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch

I got bitches wanna box me like I'm cinnamon toast crunch
I just pull up and I square up like I'm cinnamon toast crunch

It ain't no glitch when your heart stop
I've been that bitch since the start, Doc
Dude wanna trap me, that smart cock
But I made him pull out like a park lot
I'm counting real bank in a Rover
At the most, gave me cold shoulders
But now I'm making bitches pay for it
Like a new fit at FashionNova
You could never do it, watch how I pursue it
Money, I've been doing, I need life insurance
Bitch yo money little, so we call you Stuart
Been there, done that like a motherfucking tourist
Yeah, the money nice, it is so polite
Spent it Sunday night, Monday got it twice
Out here living life, bounce through with the rice
They say money talk? I see why they shy
Sweatsuits in the studio, running through the B-side track
I should buy these other hoes real suits
'Cause I'm everything that they slack
Bitches really got it twisted, I'm not talking one liter with a cap
I don't fuck with none of these bitches, not even Siri on Google Maps
Refrigerator is full for the hater
I'm not 'bout to wait her, broke bitch see you later
It's levels like layers, they offering paper
They want me to sign but I'm acting like Draya
Ain't signin' shit, bitch, bye
10 Mill of that shit dry
Good dick'll make you squint your eye
Then I'm dipping like a french fry

My niggas got munchies, soon auntie gon' cook
They blowin' weed like the Big Bad Wolf
Tellin' me stories on everything they took
But I don't repeat shit but a motherfucking hook
Bitches be irkin' me, beat her 'til burgundy
Went through emergency, now she need surgery
Now that you heard of me, you should be worried, G
Saying ""first of all"" will lead to a first degree
Show her I'm not to be played with
Fuck who that lil' bitch came with
You cross me, I'ma cross you back
With the cross on a first-aid kit
Get more than a bruise, get put on the news
I'm talkin' to you, so put on a zoot
Got nothing to prove, don't fuck up the mood
Been makin' more noise than Lollapalooz'
I'm not just talking 'bout the music side
Money love me, don't confuse the bride
Pay me first like a Uber ride
I keep shit jumpin' like the Puma sign
No one making me pause, bitch!
Your weave smelling like dog shit!
Doing numbers like a call list!
Closet like a mini mall, bitch!
Switch up the flows, when I do it, it's raw
These bitches ain't even got a verse that could touch me
Pack the straws, when I'm picking at those
'Cause when I drag bitches, I like to be comfty
Feelin' like I got gold comin'
Fake rappers ain't sold nothin'
Everybody tryna hold somethin'
Pussy drippin' like my nose runnin'

Tip of my finger got money on it not, no rock
Younger than Young Joc, but I can pull yo pop
Got a problem?

I own 99 cars, but you don't own one
I would hate me too
Money tall, like 8'2
I make your nigga call you up like, ""I need a break, boo.""
And I don't act surprised, bitch, stop with the lies
You know yo ass salty like McDonald fries

Bitches with dark clouds you know I outshine
Followed after lurking, ok bout time
You not getting followed back tho, you not even fine
You fucking busta, I'm a real hustler
Eating real meals while you out eating supper
I get that money ASAP like Rocky soon as it hit my pocky
I'm cocky, her and her copied and I still don't care
Cause I built you hoes like Build-A-Bear
Jealously from the ugly is typical
But I check bitches quicker than a physical
Hanging out with my thots got the streets on lock
We hit the mall then we shop spend a couple of rocks
You would think we at the bar the way these hoes taking shots
Stop talking if you not gone meet me at a vacant lot

Where I deliver you a message (Real shit, real shit)
Reminding you to count your blessings (Got to)
'Cause some ain't make it to they breakfast
That ain't no crisis, that's just life shit
Life go up and down like a light switch
Hang in there with a tight grip
When times get darker than a night shift
The road get bumpy like a pussy shaved down
Do what you said, not what you say now
Don't listen to 'em, there's so much hate now
The internet a 90's-baby playground
Feel undefeated when you at your weakest
Like you cannot beat this and go (go)
That ain't your friend if he walkin' with money
While you sitting hungry, that's cold
That ain't your bro, nigga that's low
Fast money, you will not die slow
I done placed so many flowers on different graves
I tell my dates now, don't bring a rose

It was days I dreamed of money
But I woke up broke instead (Why?)
Maybe that's my fault, I shouldn't sleep until I'm dead (I'm woke)
You want it, you gotta work at it (You gotta)
You gotta stay chill, don't panic (You gotta)
Be a better bitch than them bitches out there
Want abortion money but not pregnant
You know those that can't keep count after 'uno, dos'
Man it shows
People think no cons come with they pros (But they do)
But I'm dealing with real shit
My stretch marks really itch
My hair haven't grown an inch
But I'm still that bitch
Black marks on my inner thighs
Well man don't criticize me (Don't do it)
'Cause everybody got flaws
If you think you don't you must can't see (Look in the mirror)
Follow me to get close
Not to just compliment my clothes (I'm on the 'gram)
'Cause if my crib get burned down will you still follow my robe?

Gotta stay ahead, never say you finish
What you gonna do in the next 2 minutes?
Gotta stay ahead, never say you finish
What you gonna do in the next 2 minutes? (Hey, hey)
What you gonna do in the next 2 minutes?

Playing both sides, why the fuck did you lie to her face telling her we just talking?
Answer the question dude, I was never buggin' you
You may have thought you was fucking me, but I was fuckin' you
I had my guard up, how can I be comfortable?
Your eyes wandered instead of looking at me like I was wonderful
Trash niggas so I packed his shit in a Hefty
Go and lie, say you left me to one of your besties

I can stand alone if on the throne we can not sit together
Yeah you say you love me but you show different ways
Fuck what you say, you made it clearer than an icing on glaze
Nights after the night, the side pillow is alone
When yo' ass home it still feel like you gone
Still got boyish ways, you don't act like you grown
You done turned me off so now you up on your own

Tryna make it where like everyday it's Christmas (
yup, yup

I just throw it to the plug tell him, ""Ship this.""
Then I'm back up on the run, like fitness (

No red carpet, but you bitches got me on the floor rolling
Yeah, you got a foreign, but I bet that shit stolen
Pockets sticking out, with no doubt, they look swollen
Cleaning shit out, like I'm getting me a colon
I'm earning my respect once I take a nigga check
Cross the line, then you dead, and I'm not talking flat
All these broke bitches never in the mood
I feed the streets with the heat, no spoon (

Isolate myself from the evil (

Mind stay sharper than a needle (

I milk the game with flavor, Nesquik
My luck just started, now it can't be stopped
In a Bentley now, but I came from the bus stop
I had to grind, while people out taking a lot
Used to save a lot just to shop at Save-a-Lot
With no team, I chase my dreams
Funny how the world think it's funny making me into memes
But they don't know, that's free promo

I could vouch for that
But some still stuck in a state of mind
Or putting us behind and making us leave out the back (where we're parked)
Play that damn angel when they among us (yeah)
But 164 years back they hung us (y'all did that)
I'm not a slave to the white man or white woman standing by me
I'm not a slave to the record labels bidding how to sign me
I am not a slave, I am brave
Video every cop that make us stop
Before our body drop and be sure to press ""save""
We need that for proof, these cops they goof
They pull you over and shoot, then play it off like, ""Oops.""
Intimidated by our presence, so he be drawing the weapon
Not screaming justice for nothing
We not gone, keep on failing (nah)

Beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves, we just not picking cotton (in the feilds)
Y'all beat us and treat us so rotten
Still think we slaves, we just not picking cotton (we need a pill)
Y'all beat us and treat us so rotten (so rotten)
Beat us and treat us so rotten (so rotten)

Freedom of speech 'til I'm hoarse

No cast but I cut niggas fast as fuck
I been a G, no wagon or truck
I put a nigga on a shirt and I ain't talking 'bout no merch drop
This pussy worth a lot of bread, so we gon' call this bird box

That bitch slower than a turtle, ay

my true colors stay purple
'Cause they need to see that I'm royalty

I wonder when a bunch of college kids screaming ""Fuck me"" turned five

Bitch this my body I'll fuck around and finger myself on Live
Bitch I'm never scared, never cared, shit you rock, bitch I'll never wear
Catch that bitch in Chicago and one punch drop her in Delaware
Your own block, you never there
By myself, I'm never pair
Keep one of my sleeve and my pants, that's why they hella flare

They 'bout this, they 'bout that, they getting money, they big liars
All y'all niggas fake as shit like Jamal off Empire
You waiting on one check, by then I done touched ten wires
Head game so fire like I sat under a wig dryer
Stay the fuck out my face, your wig older than Myspace
That wig must be tight lace, couldn't keep up on my light pace
I blew three hundred at the steakhouse and I ain't even add on dessert
My pussy stay having asthma attacks, so I let it breathe in the skirt
I hate a easy bitch, a needy bitch, a let me smoke your weedy bitch
A guy come she leave me bitch, touch me after sneezing bitch
I'on owe no nigga shit, I'on give a fuck if you feed me bitch
Eat this pussy in return, now we both fed, act greedy bitch
I can't even see ya, like my wig cut like Sia
Got more dough, pizzeria, when you looked on my Visa
Bitch slow gotta speed up, no I don't need much
Flight attendant bring me food, I said, ""What are these,"" she said ""These nuts""

I laughed then I had to mumble, 
all these bitches need to be humble
These hoes get a couple of bundles then they really think they Rapunzel
I can't never let the bag crumble, Jordyn Woods let the bag fumble
Yeah, you drop music, but it's weak as fuck, so pick it up that's a stumble
And I put that up on gang, I might fuck around, go insane
Shootin' in your crib like Tyler Perry turned a happy home into a House of Payne
And there ain't no bitch in my lane, I can always spare change

Like Wendy Williams, heat stroke
Bitch, I’m so cold, gotta rock me a thermal
Or sweater right under the coat
Bitch, I got so many bars
That Azealia Banks call me when she needs soap (No shade)
I just be shootin' like craps (Brah)
Ten different flows when I rap (Yah)
Sleepin' on me, that shit wack (Wack)
I hope the bed bugs attack (Hah)
Why is my name in your mouth?
Tell the dentist get rid of it, right with that plaque (Get it out)
Bitch, I’m out here seein' M's, you just seein' M&M's in the pack
Run in your house and I'm flippin' the couch
Yeah, you know this a trap but I'm not talking mouse
Now I got you tied up like an unfaithful spouse
Put the cash in the bag, I don’t got time to count
’Cause you know this bitch called the cops (Cops)
Flavor Flav, she got clocked (Clock)
Up her head, 'cause she an opp
Seeing if she still alive like Pac, ayy
Your man keep ringing my line (Ring)
He don’t understand decline (Nah)
I'ma have to stomp him out (How?)
Like turnin' grapes into wine
And he still gon' think I’m a keeper (I'm a keeper)
'Cause I'm dressed every day like it's Easter (Like it's Easter)
Bitches be swearin' they cute but they look like that bow up on Rihanna's sneakers (Ugly)
Had to check that bitch, I'm Netflix rich
No Miley Cyrus, I wreck that bitch
Bread like a bird so I peck that bitch
What's your address? That's how I address that shit
Bullets sent her to heaven, no Keyshia Cole (Bah bah bah)
You don't wanna know what the Visa hold (Bah bah bah)
These bitches heated like pizza rolls
I'm in the penthouse but I get my sheets from Kohl's
I'm smart with the bag, I'm a great (Great)
That's the same ho that used to hate (Funny)
But now these bitches in my face like we on Beyond Scared Straight, wait, yeah
Ain't none of that, I be makin' bitches mad
I pull up in the Jag, then I flex, then I brag
You should wear a durag, 'cause your edges look sad
Think you look Megan Good, but you Michael Jackson bad
Bitch you need to stop, your nigga askin' me why I tease a lot
I said ""I don't know, can I breathe or not?""
His bread gone like an empty pizza box
I'm finna leave the spot (Skrrt)
I spent 13K on some Gucci (Gucci)
He spent thirteen dollars on your coochie (Coochie)
Took your ass to see Tunechi, look (What?)
Bitch, you really is a groupie, ayy
Shawty if I'm not aware of them ('Ware of them)
You know I'm 'bout to start airing 'em (Bah bah bah)
All I hang with is animals, deeper than the Shedd Aquarium (Yeah)
Niggas so fake, they'll kill they friend
And at the funeral show up and carry 'em (Fake as fuck)
Soon as everybody leave
Spit up on his grave soon as they bury him
They still mad, that's the best part (Best part)
Give me more bite with the less bark (Bark bark)
You can put your bitch on the leash (Leash)
Or I'ma drag that bitch right to PetSmart
I'ma let you choose, but I make the rules
Keep me a tool, so play it cool
Second to who? No, I never lose
I always cum first like the day April Fools
I'll take a train to the money, ride a plane to the money
Ride a dick to the money, what it do?
I got so much paper on me
My homie thinkin' that I'm 'bout to go right back to school, ayy
Big chopper on me like Bruce, ayy (Bruce)
Big mouth, bitch that's a moose, ayy (Moose)
All my life I've been snappin' like a Snapple
Yeah they know I got the juice
How your hair stay laid but your rent ain't paid?
And your bed ain't made but you geek?
Bitches be dirty, panties look like lemonade
Every time they fuck around and pee
I just be ridin' the beat, always deliver heat
Then I eat it up, that's Uber Eats
They don't want beef 'cause I pop up on bitches
Like corners when tuckin' in some newer sheets, bah",https://genius.com/Cupcakke-petsmart-lyrics

Ignorant, ignat'
Ignorant ,ignat, ignorant
Whatever the fuck do you call it
Whatever the fuck do you call it
Ay, lemme stop playing......

Cash or credit I take both
I get dirty money might need soap
Summertime still a cold world so I walk around in a peacoat
Don't interfere with my gangsta
Saw mo' money than a banker
Ain't no therapy for my anger
Cause I'll put the therapist in danger
Original bitch, who dont take no one shit
If them niggas start buggin' I raid they shit
In other words I spray they shit, whip a bitch ass I Nae Nae shit
I catch a confession I am the connection
I'm bodying niggas just out of perfection
Witness protection should be his direction
Known to cut up like a fucking C-Section
(Ouu )Quick thought, (Ouu)quick thought
I should take a nigga chips then dip off
Matter fact take a nigga chips with a dip sauce
If a nigga talk take his lip off, shine on hoes like lip gloss
Trigger happy when I let the clip off
R.I.P that nigga like a rip off
Fuck back and forth like a swing ,cause I don't talk I just swing
Bars doper than Charlie Sheen , couple shots you gone lean
Not talking liquor slowmo I'm gone snap like a fucking photo
Rich neighbors gone call the popo, like ""Oh my God, oh no!""
That's what happen when you fuck with a goon
The Draco go loony more than Looney Toons
Up in the sky all you see is balloons
12 more opps we can link up at noon
Drawing on yall but not into graffitti
Never argue with someone who beneath me
You got Yeezys but them bitches look sleepy
Tired ass fuck from you wearing them weekly
Dirty little broad in a dirty bra, bet a mill that you not going far
But to the car for a cigarette ,glove department might live a rat
Hoes breath stank need they liver check
Gotta watch hoes I need a sitter check
Why worry now when I been a threat?
Since a shorty getting drunk off Similac
Ruger Ruger Ruger riding with me in a Uber
If I smell something fishy on the opps
I'm a take they bread and make tuna
I shoot like a trained shooter strip a nigga naked like Hooters
Rug covered up in blood leaking thru the floor let me call Luna
I'm a handful so use both hands
These two hands will kill both mans
Fuck a yes man need a no man
I open more doors than a door man for these rappers, actors
These are real factors still haven't met no competition
Cause none of yall hoes matter
That makeup do not match yo skin tone
I'm wondering what the fuck went wrong
That Yaki is older than flip phones
Don't take it out now it shoulda been gone
Work all day fuck a shift, traffic all day like Lyft
Call me Emily Elizabeth I got a chopper bigger than Cliff
Walk in the park, this shit a walk in the park

Now you wanna sneak diss while admiring?
You should take a look at yo environment
Cause all my niggas convicts , wake up wanting conflict
So you know they clappin' any fucking ratchet that I tell em
Bitch this a bomb flick
Looking at that lipo I think something need to be fixed
And you can mention me one more time
When you made more than one hit
Cause this the Windy City ain't shit pretty, you gone have to toughen up
Drop a line of hoes going straight down yo chest like a buttonup
Chiraq my city you cannot handle bro
Jump out on business like I'm a manual
Walk through any block I'm a lost animal
Split her down the middle like a camel toe
After I pull up she gone need a doctor
I'm at her door like go home Roger
Just to show out like niggas in new J's
Trick girl and scout I'm tighter than new braids
See Kash Doll, I mean Trash Doll
Bitch you don't even know me
No face, no case, so I can't even use emoji's
(Its too late fuck a debate)
Crack her head with her own mixtape
Dare you to get out of pocket , bitch eyes a be out of socket
How the fuck do you got options? When you be on the pole for the profit?
Reminding,  I'm glad yo outfits be shiny
Bitch I got that poison Ivy
If Trash Doll on the mic I'll take her light like Steph with Riley
(She prolly ain't even catch that, you know bitches dont use they brain no more, they give it though)
Do a 360, with a clean hit, let a bullet hit her and sting shit
Warm up yo ass on some Spring shit
When the law come I do not speak English
You don't know what you started, but ch-ch you a target
I'll pledge allegiance but I'm heartless
Plant another body in my garden
Miss slurp that dick till it cum will make yo name smaller than a crumb
I'll chew you up and then spit you out
Like you shit but a piece of gum
Started from the bottom stripping yo way up
Thought she was Ronald McDonald with all of that makeup
Got to come deeper,  bye Felicia, I mean Keisha
You a stripper hoe get it on the floor
Probably never owned a fucking Visa
Uh!

You fake booty bitch, fake titty bitch
Who can't fucking rap, I could teach you some shit
All you had to do was ask bruh , all you had to do was ask

Got arrested, had my mama stressing
That one day she would get the wrong call
Only got two fits on my dresser
Go to school dealing with depression
Getting teased cause I couldn't read
So I told the teacher, ""I'm a skip this lecture""
Running out of class super fucking fast
Fuck a hall pass, homework in the trash
I'm so damn pissed, now I gotta piss
I walk in, you won't guess who up in this bitch
A young girl sitting on the floor
She got a reputation like she the school hoe
They wrote all on her locker, dosed her up with flakka
Every night she getting raped by her father
Told her, ""Just pray for the best""
Went to CVS for a pregnancy test
And I swear, it couldn't get no worse
Feel like I'm sitting here dealing with a curse
Mama took all the visas quick
Friends calling her a piece of shit
Father sent her back to school, tryna play it cool
With a black eye shades could fix
How could you molest your own child?
And still go to work so damn proud?
Cause you love the sound of her screaming loud
You a sick motherfucker, let me tell you now

Who was there?
Who was there, when she scream help?
Who was there, who was there?
It was just herself

Ain't nobody got no heart here
Tell me how did I start here?

Noticed she was getting underpaid
Now she headed to public aid
Tryna get food stamps for the newborn
The struggle feel unreal like a unicorn
Baby girl stretching a hundred dollars in food
She wanna eat from home, but daddy spit in her food
Take her to the back when her mom fall asleep
Told her, ""take it like you grown if you want something to eat""
He tied her hands down, pulled her pants down
She start to bleed, imagine dealing with this shit every day of the week
He force it in till 10, she start to feel weak
Wrapped his hands around her mouth and realized she couldn't breathe
He told her, ""Shut up, get the fuck up, I don't love ya, clean this nut up""
Her mother coming down the hall
It's the only real way that she looked up
But mama still pretend she ain't see shit
While her daughter feelin' so seasick
Well not seasick, 'cause that's a understatement
Her family treat her so underrated
She banging on my door, we gotta go in a rush
Grab my coat now we in the ER, rush
Doctor face so straight it's the scariest
Looked her in the eye and tell her she miscarried it

This is getting more unhealthy than junk (than junk)
Call 99 times and he ain't pick up once
Descending to the rain we falling straight down the drain
Checking through his phone it be them numbers with no names
What the fuck, why you tryna get up?
Wasn't you just thirsty for that bitch
I'm guessing you lost the hiccup all I'm asking for is closure
To find another me you might need a four leaf clover
I could name a lot of shit that you lack
But I got niggas in the back that want me with them like Rosa

You keep telling me this and that
I'm knowing you hitting that
Shame we can't have a chat without the tit for tat
Try to talk it out but you end up walking out

Pathetic all I see is synthetic hair shed all in my bed
That nigga dead when I see him he gone need a medic
Together forever until one of us have a funeral
Stupid ass me I should of knew it wasn't mutual
Will the cheating ever stop
Temptation, allegation said she hate it until she send me screenshots

Something that's gon' last through the summertime weather
Need me a man who gon' be down with whatever
I'm talkin' rainin' outside, give me your jacket for shelter
Gon' put it 50/50, stay if the bank is empty
Don't listen to these hoes 'cause I know how hoes envy
Quick respond to my text, the opposite of my ex
If he comin' then I'm comin' 'cause bitch we come as a set
That's for you, but all my old niggas, they were straight actin'
Had five bitches, claimin' they his sisters, like they the Braxtons
I peaked it, this nigga spent nights out on the weekend
Went from talkin' each other's heads off, to now we not speakin'
So to the next man enter my life with a plan
Please don't just  plan on being labeled my man
If I ever fall, I wanna fall on your hands
Then when I open my eyes, I wanna fall in a trance

What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?
How much love can you give me? What's the total?

Not postin' Insta' pics into your post line
Know the game so don't try because I'm not a lame
It's not just weave in my head, I got a brain
The men I bring home gotta have some good ding-dong
Love men like King Kong if you wanted the ringtone
Not trying to pressure the man, I just want someone steady
Make my toes curlin' 'round but savin' me from a pedi
Speaking of petty I ain't watchin' Netflix and chill
I wanna go to the movies, man, show me it's real
Love a man on his hustle, then goin' to get his skills
Know when to buy Jordans and when to pay the bills
Wake up durin' the night just to get me some pop
I need that one o' clock, on the dot, his phone not on lock
This is what I deserve, give me a stand up soul mate
Someone that can brush hoes off like Colgate

What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?
How much love can you give me? What's the total?
What is it worth? Is it worth not bein' solo?

Maybe we just need space (Space)
If the time ain't shared, it's a waste, look (Waste)

Can't hold this in no more like weak bladder, ayy

You ain't never been shit but a letdown (Ain't shit)
Wait, who the fuck is that in the background?
Let me pull up, get dragged like a prom gown
Why you gotta poke the bear to come out?
Only 'posed to make me cum in your mouth
Thought I had a rider, I'ma reroute
Stress 'bout to make me snatch my weave out
But I'm bitchin'
Friends been told me to leave, sayin' he ain't what I need
And it's true but I ain't listen (I'm stupid)
Locksmith changed these keys to my heart for the last time
Need somethin' different (I'm done)
For once, I been with this nigga for months
And I'm already like fuck him
Like he's some kin to that man Donald Trump
Let's get to the facts, you don't text back
Been messaging bitches but swear that you hacked
Then I'll take you back, then back to the flack
Said I'm no help so I'll help you pack
Now you ain't gotta worry about me naggin'
I pull more niggas than a wagon
Better act like you know what's happenin'

Cereal and Water,Eden,2018.0,"Y'all stupid ass parents so lazy
Praise a snapback more than a baby
Let that baby grow up like, ""Who raised me?""
Never had no car so she named her Mercedes
Dumb shit y’all do, yeah I'm talkin' ’bout you
Conehead ass bitches but don't know the scoop
Kid in a crib lonely, cookin' up soup
While mama on dates eating lobsters, I'm through
You failed the mission, you kept your distance
That kid would be rich if you paid her attention
The morals is missing, the world is different
If you mind your business, you could own a business
Deadbeat fathers and deadbeat mothers
Crazy how y'all pin blacks against each other
""You too dark for blonde hair, look at your skin color""
Bitch my skin look and tastes just like Nutella (You heard?)
You racist, so fuck what you say
He black sellin' weed, he will never see day
That's funny when abusers ain't locked away
They in the crib giving more beats than Dr. Dre
They suspect, oh they cops? We don’t trust that
Black people don’t drive home, just take the bus back
These cops killin' us off like we some Rugrats
So I ain’t got time, I'm finna get me a bus pass

Cereal and water, I'ma eat either way
Niggas only wave when the fee gettin' waived
Said what he said, then be like, ""What I say?""
Like K. Michelle, I got rid of the fake
Cereal and water, I’ma eat either way
Niggas only wave when the fee gettin' waived
Said what he said, then be like, ""What I say?""
Like K. Michelle, I got rid of the fake

All that fuck shit, just dead it (Dead it)
They don't wanna give us our credit (Credit)
Ain't the same tape they spreadin' (Nah)
If it's black on white crime then it's edit
Young queens feelin' like peasants
Priorities mixed up, yeah I said it
One 'bout to jump off the edge
The other worry 'bout her edges
Labels offer me advance, I'm too advanced, so that shit dead (I don't want it)
They swear to God that they God, please listen close to what I just said (C'mon)
People be so confused, one day the sky blue then it's red (Figure it out)
I don't ever get it twisted, if I got it twisted, I'ma get dreads (You heard?)
Damn, is they 'bout to fight? Hold the fuck on, let me pull my phone out
Really wish I could see the shit, but the crowd big and they zoned out
But I'ma get this for WorldStar, let me get close, ""Beat that ass ho!""
It all hit, what she should've did
When she found out it's her cousin bro
CupcakKe, let's go out for a drink
Nah I can't link if I'm on link
Yeah, back then that's all I think
Struggle might drain me but I ain't sink
Females thinkin' that they better than another
But at night we all playin' that Tink
All going through the, ""Where he at?""
""Am I good enough?"", and everything in between
I don't wanna hear it, you can save it
We all gettin' played like a playlist (Playlist)
Women scared to tell what they age is (Age is)
'Cause men want the kids, fuckin' rapists (Rapists)
Uh, step back, you contagious
Friends turned on me like pages
Heart got a lot of empty spaces
Gotta keep it together like braces
Suicide, they givin' up so quickly
Jump out the car but not doin' the Shiggy
Rain on my parade, it will never get me
A little drizzle only make my hair frizzy
Pass me the towel rag, all that nonsense I'll pass
Anything mom want, I'll grab
Cop it like Angela Valdes, look
Don't be a puppet, don't be corrupted
Don't be a motherfuckin' outcast
I don't say shit 'cause words get switched
Like was it cash cow or cow cash?
Ones worried 'bout doin' numbers
Is the main numbers I'ma dial last
Same man say he don't fear shit
Be scared to wipe the shit from his child ass

Cereal and water, I'ma eat either way
Niggas only wave when the fee gettin' waived

Sending out dirty pics like you selling dick
Selling a love story that don't exist
Can't make me happy no more you make me pissed
Fucking and licking up on another bitch
Sending out dirty pics like you selling dick

Like a black cat at one o'clock in the morning
Snuck through your phone saw one text, ""I'm horny""
For you to be my nigga that was real corny
But get some rest I'm on that ass in the morning (I am)
Fuck naw , I'm on that ass right now
When I want the dick you be way too high (You do)
Was you chilling with the bros or maybe that was a lie
Got bitches lurking on my page like a motherfucking spy
They thinking we a couple but ain't even got a title
They thinking we in love looking for rings and David bridal
Who you been fucking when I be up on my cycle?
That's when he start saying ""baby you kind of psycho""
Nah, young nigga I'm the realist
When a woman love your demands can't feel it
Not getting love in return that'll put me in my feelings
I let you bust when you want when my knees be kneeling
You just PG-13 and I'm Rated R
Cause I thought I was the only bitch up in your heart
I'm tryna figure out the pieces, what you hiding in the dark?
Is you mad? Was you lying from the fucking start?
Sometimes you make me feel like I ain't shit
I hop on Instagram uploading pics
But why I get up on your page seeing bitches that you laid Comment call me baby I want the dick
And what happened to the roses? They stop coming in
What happen to ""I ain't pulling out I'm cumming in""?
What happen to the  Louis Gucci, Prada , and the Fend ?
I'm assuming another bitch got all that coming in
But it's cool, two can do the same nigga
You not a real nigga, you's a fucking lame nigga
This not no arcade stop it with the games nigga
I need an elephant dick become a pussy hitter

Man, I never said love cost
Always wondered what you fucking thought
Lying and cheating but now you call?

Fucking and licking up on another bitch
Sending out dirty pics like you selling dick

And it all start playing out up in my head
At the strip clubs where you spend your bread
Only time you pop up is in my bed
You treat me like crap and you won't text back like you dead
That bitch sticking around for that paycheck
And you just sticking around for that late neck
Telling me lies when you look me in my eyes
And I'm knowing that you cheating and I hate that
But fuck it you can't say that bitch look better
And what's her name man, I hope it ain't Heather
And when you get up in my bed you said fuck what she said
Cause you like how my pussy get wetter
Do you think I'm trouble, trouble (I'm not)
Stop lying you ain't working no doubles
I know you whipped between her legs thinking about my head
And everything just become that struggle
Sometimes you got me feeling like I'm mental
When the truth is you just a fucking rental
You got a sweet tooth for every young thing that pass by
If you keep it up you might need a dental
And do you think you can trust that bitch?
Knowing you a dopeboy , she a snitch
I held you down when you ain't have shit
What's funny is another bitch pop up when you rich
Do you think that's a good excuse now?
And do you dry my tears when I cry
You just a fucking hoe fucking a fucking hoe
Telling me and that bitch a whole bunch of lies

Man, I never said love cost
Always wondered what you fucking thought

I feel sick as fuck, and no, it ain't the flu (
nah, nah

So devastated this elevated into a breakup
Like a elevator, baby, I wanted to take this way up (

I'm in shock, how did our relationship flop?
I want a man who walk in the door and never think to knock
Took me to another level (

And you showing yo true colors, got more than Fruity Pebbles
We was closer than siblings
How I'm supposed to be willing to bury my feelings if I never owned a shovel?
Every time I let my walls down, everything falls down (
yeah

Why wait 'til months pass to say ""let's pause now"" (
Why?

When dogs don't even wanna be in the dog pound

I got dismissed quicker than 2:45 at school (

I ain't even do shit, swear it's so ludicrous
In bed to shed, 'cause I wanna know who he with
When and where, no, I don't wanna share (
I don't

Gave him the key to my heart
I should have kept me a spare for the next guy, don't ask why
No wonder why he had more phones than Best Buy (

Must be hiding shit
Maybe with a island bitch
Was so blind, I could come check my eyes real quick
Could've at least left for two minutes, like you had to go potty
But you left me here forever, now I have nobody
I thought if I sit around, and let it keep me down
Only how a nigga leave his girl is if he found a rebound (

Single While Taken,Ephorize,2018.0,"Her name must be Karen 'cause you just stopped carin'
Broke my heart now it needs some repairin'
With no bitch, I'm gon' be out here sharin'
All you hear is ""I"" like you 'bout to start darin'
None of this the same like it was in the past
I want you to pay attention, they want you to pay the tab
Convincin' myself like, ""It ain't that bad""
See a problem and skip over it like a YouTube ad
I confront you with some shit, you say, ""It ain't that deep""
Yeah, it ain't that deep until a bitch go and cheat
You gotta fix this, you actin' fishy like fish sticks
You buggin' like bugs surroundin' at picnics
Don't take this to heart but we losin' our spark
You only come through at night like glow-in-the-dark
Give me more than the dick, man, get on your shit
So many make ups for fuck ups  real quick
Man, scratch that, all our good times in my flashback
All you had to do was act 21, no blackjack
Feet hurted, I was on your back like a backpack
See, all I do is reminisce and sit back and backtrack
The kisses ain't the same and the hugs ain't the tighest
I don't even smile and when I do it ain't the whitest
Been with you for a day in a room full of silence
If love don't cost a thing, why the fuck am I so biased?

Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken

Do you understand your position?
I just want a man that's consistent
Tryna see inside you is the vision
But I can't 'cause everything look tinted
Think that I ain't noticed that I'm not your main focus?
Can't go a day without dealin' with commotion
Haha, hehe, everything is jokin'
'Till I let a new man get me wet like the ocean
Walk away, you want me back, I walk away like ""girl, you snapped""
I walk away, I won't be back, the next day, I'm on your lap
It's a trap to get me back where you want me
I know I'm a snack but that don't mean treat me like a junkie
All you had to do was make me smile like Bridget
I shouldn't have to tweet I'm single for male attention
Everything good then we fuck and make up
The same night you sneakin' out if I don't fuckin' stay up
Yo, I'm tight, am I done fussin'? Not quite
I can't stand and be polite
I don't beat around the bush, I'm not Ike
Done tryna be patient, I'm so irritated, I just wanna know what we're doin'
Tellin' people that I'm taken when there's other things I wanna be pursuin'

Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'
Got me feeling like I'm single while taken
Hoes you keep chasin', heart keep on breakin'

Exceptions,Cum Cake,2015.0,"Uh, It be those lonely nights when you dim the lights
And then maybe I could have made it right
If he just thought about me for once
Fuck ""I"" if he said ""we"" for once
If only he invite me over, lay me on the sofa
Hold me closer when I bleed this month
Make me feel warm inside in the backseat
Or the front seat in the car, bus, or a taxi
I don't give a fuck I ride for you, do what you tell me to
Don't trip at all, when another bitch call
Don't fix my tongue to ask who she is
Cause I know what we got and I know what the fuck we is
I can't flex, I was obsessed with the way we fucked
You cum then we rest, but now I think like, ""why did we sink?""
It's up to me like a bodycon dress
I said ring my bell, don't give me hell
Bring me flowers, but you didn't come that hour
He said, ""Baby, what the hell? My signal fell
I was just watching an episode of Power.""

We finna go our own direction if you don't learn your lesson

Now he wanna take the condom off
But not giving me love or nothing above
It's like giving me a dick that's soft, useless, feel foolish
He said long as the dick stay good, then he rule this
That's not true
I know the man that I met before him, a new man
That's a whore, it's not you
That ain't nothing but the devil
Knowing you young,  looking for fun
And not quite ready to settle I spoke when I woke up
You ain't text back whats the hold up?
I'm just sitting here wishing fucking on a man with a mission
This a hard decision accepting a man with bitches
Knowing I'm listed how can I miss this
When niggas don't listen? And something ain't right but pause
And every night he come home from not answering the phone
I'm so tempted to smell his drawers
But overall I love the way he grip me
I get a special feeling when he with me
That's what I breathe for I'm not knocking that nigga
I'm just saying I need more niceness and effort
Cause I'm a good bitch
I can get a man that look like Tyson Beckford
But that's out of style you used to dry my tears
But now I use a towel you gotta step it up or come a extra mile
Before you ever get a chance to milk this cow again

We finna go our own direction if you don't learn your lesson

So damn sassy
Airport, please don't pat me
'Fore you get popped like acne
Your friends tacky, say they got your back when you at me
But you look back, empty back seats
Only buy Skittles, 'cause your money so damn little
Whip her with the hair, no Willow
Niggas so fickle, don't tell me about kiddo
I don't play Malcolm in the Middle

Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, not cut from the same cloth, you can have it
I am a whole 'nother fabric
Bitch, I am made a savage, chasin' that cabbage

Don’t let me see where the Porsche at (Skrrt)
Get your shit snatched like a corset (Give me that)
Need new bundles, where the horse at? (Where it's at?)
I'm always in front like a doormat
Comin' in the game, I ain't never been a lame
Boy you in the same lane, I ain't far past (Far past)
No candy cane, blood, no we can't hang
Lil' bitch gettin' scalped like barrettes (Barrettes)
Police sees I'm a hard ass (Hard ass)
Shoot a nigga right where his heart at (Heart at)
Took a bitch spot, now she don't know where to park at
Want my advice, just car crash (Skrrt)
No time to play, I got a flight to LA
But first, let me slide up to the bank
You know the money big when the bank teller say
""I wish I can, but I can't!"" (They dumbass)
No, I can't give you that much
Three to five days is a must
But I walked out the bitch same day with 100K
Of course that nigga had a crush
So I'm in her phone
Look at this pussy, it's goals
Say you get bread, that's mold, hah, hah
Pull up to my shows
Please don't wear no clothes, hah, hah
No Amber Rose, I'm 21 and savage, she cold, hah, hah
Got so many flows, Progressive should hire a ho

Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, nigga you really are made too average
Hah, hah, fabric, fabric, not cut from the same cloth, you can have it

Since you out fucking on a real hoe
Got 20 bitches entertaining you
Like cheerleaders at a field show
I'on give a fuck cause you cheated once
And you must think I’ma still let you
Call after call when I'm with you
Let me guess dude, it’s a bill collector?
Yeah, yeah, yeah same excuse
Damn boy, how lame is you?
This that shit that anger do
Cause you let hoes hang with you
Everytime I try to talk to you is like all you do is start hollering
You got me walking on eggshells everyday like this Halloween
What if it’s not meant, all that time we spent
Do it all vanish?
How do men find a way to call them all bae
How they even manage?
Now you tryna take advantage
Since you realize that you all I got
Help me understand how you never call
But you tryna call the shots?
Want you by me , don’t gotta buy me
Be with me all the time like an ID
Something telling me you got a side piece
And thinkin’ I’m a let it slide B (That's dead)
Fuck naw, matter fact, fuck y’all
I’d rather get my foot sawed
If this the pain that love cause

This whole thing so awkward (I swear)
I’m irritated don’t bother (I swear)
Comin’ home after doing wrong
With another story like a author
Probably got a son and a daughter (On the low)
Cause trusting you getting harder (Gotta go)
Say your phone dead every time I call
But you left out with your charger
This whole thing so awkward (I swear)

Cause trusting you getting harder (Gotta go)
Say your phone dead every time I call
But you left out with yo charger

I stand by the truth like a pulpit
I deserve much better than this bullshit
I don’t know what made you think you could pull this
We gotta fix a lot of shit with a tool kit
Really shawty, you a busy body and you always on the go
Just wanted it to be me and you like we was about to elope
We splitting, cause you don’t get it
You cappin' harder than a fitted
Got caught you almost shitted
Hurry up and leave my digits
I treated you like royalty
Couldn’t even get no loyalty
Got me then you stop spoiling me
Starting to feel like you torture me
If you into me, show me chemistry
I’m a fuck around and think you spinnin’ me
A ex-nigga is what you finna be
I ain’t showing you no sympathy
I’m back off you mad soft
How you treat women like this?
It’s really sad how you act mad
But ain’t got the right to be pissed
I’m always second best
I shouldn’t have to second guess
I’m a toss yo ass to the next bitch
And tell her “psst, psst go fetch” (Bitch)
Need me a nigga who gone try his hardest
Paint you the picture since, yes I’m a artist
If you can’t be here when shit gets the darkest
Get to the side like a cop  when I park it

This whole thing so awkward (I swear)

Since you smokin' niggas, that's a Hot Cheeto puff

’Til a nigga get shot like Mussolin's butt
Fuck all that shit, I don't gotta act hard (Nah)
21 and I'm walkin' with a black card

Ran up a check, I should be a track star
He ain't eatin' right, so I make the cat fart
Right on that nigga face (Haha)
Should've saw his expression, look like he got maced
Fuck what that nigga say (Fuck him, fuck him)
Shoes untied, but I still win a race
I’m on a whole ’nother level, bitch, I stand out (Stand out)
Cookie jar bitches got they hands out (Hands out)
If you don't answer, then I’m at your man's house (Man's house)
Nickname, ""Get More,"" 'cause he ran out
What trends have you set? Can I ask? (Can I ask?)
Rockin’ lace fronts but you come in last
Hoes swear they be gettin' that bag (What?)
Same bitch wear clothes with a tag
Weak ass music got my ear bleedin'
My bitches don't jump, we ain't cheerleadin'
Noise in the crib, I don't fear demons
Claimin' they woke, but they still dreamin'

Wake him up with a large cup, large cup, large cup
Give him some of that Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks
When they see me, they starstruck, starstruck, starstruck
Big money, call it Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks (Hahaha)

So much money, I don't know what to do with it (Do with it)

Edges on Mr. Clean, bitch, bald (Bald head)
You said that pussy tighter than a straw
But he told me he couldn't even feel it raw
Okay, um, hello
Scared bitch, scarecrow
Some of my nails broke
'Cause I made her eye match her elbow, wait
Ain't got time for no rival (Rival)
I stay booked like the Bible (Bible)
In these streets, I'm so liable
To tote that rifle and send hoes higher than the Eiffel
Shit never stop like a hot mom
I'm here to the end like dot com
Rastas pull up like, ""Wagwan?""
""Let me know if you need a new shotgun""
I'm like, ""Okay, merch that, uncle""
Too much money, how can I be humble?
I can never be a letdown, save that for the hair up on Rapunzel

Give him some of that Starbucks, Starbucks, Starbucks

Listen...

Drama free don't speak to me (hell nah), whatchu know about EBT?
I came from nothing no GED, now I got a article on MTV (I do)
Draw the line like yellow tape
Blowing up like overweight
That money talk that money talk
Like anything that Oprah say (that money!)
One second they T'd talking
Come across em they speed walking
Yeah the trigger, I squeeze off it
This the reason why we need coffins
Make it where you can't see straight
Known for the hands like a DJ (wassup?)
I'm only near if my money there or aw shit I'm a be late (busy)
Pull up with the guys, catch a nigga by surprise
Bet yo ass won't survive, I ain't letting shit slide
Choke a nigga with his tie, then I tell him ""nice try""
When I'm up to something I cause corruption
Get my hands dirty like construction
One bullet blow that nigga brains out
Make it where that nigga can't function (buh!)
We can meet inside no Ravioli
Waste time, rock him with the Rolly
Then the shotgun get rid of you
I'll stick it on you like Gorilla Glue (you know it)
Fuck out my face tryna bargain
It was days I was out here I was starving
I'm swinging and bringing  gorillas & killers
To charge in like I'm Tarzan
I'm a get it if I want it, CPD know me bitch I'm wanted (I'm wanted)
Fuck around, 'bout to get yo dough scammed
Y'all bitches slower than slow jams
House big like a factory, cannot keep track of me
Niggas came after me, I took they salary
Pull out the chopper then test out the acc'racy
Save yo memorial pic to my gallery
Wonder why they don't see me hardly
Getting more cheese than a pizza party
Damn, I missed your event? I'm sorry
I'm just out being that B like Cardi (bitch)
Thot hoes really need to die hard
Side bitches love to wear side parts
That's they logo and they motto
I then add that all up like a total
I'm so fucking ahead of the game
There's not one bitch that do it the same
Locking the safe then I'm back on a plane
If he come with baggage, then I cannot claim
Please stay the fuck away from me, gotta pay for me
Wanna see me on the show? Have 10K for me
Or, oh well, that's the end of that
I can make that shit up off the Internet
Spin around the block, waiting on a drop
Replace the bullets like outta stock
Let me see a opp, he gone need a doc
Cause I'm poking niggas, no polka dots
All I know is how to grip Glocks
Walk over niggas up in flip flops
I'm a get this money till old age
Make bitches madder than road rage
I'm juiced and I'm saucing
Don't clock in cause I'm bossing
Even crossing guards can't cross me
Bitch better wait 'til I'm crossing
Or it's gonna fuck around and be a issue
Like yo mama crying with the tissue
She got one time to say she miss you
And I'm a send that lil bitch with you
Bye!

Blah blah blah

Don't smoke or drink so yeah I'm sober when I speak
This a trap house that gun better not look petite
Say the wrong thing I'm only gone say a beat
I'm knocking at yo door like, ""Hello trick or treat""
Go to the back and put it in the bag hurry up
Gold, change, credit cards and every last buck
I'm a give you five minutes to give it up in a rush
If he fuck up bullets hitting him in the gut
Holy shit maybe we should light a candle or two
Turn a fuck nigga to a bitch nigga like Bruce
I keep a shotgun that make that nigga lights go duce
And if I send him to my guys that nigga ain't getting loose
Of course I'm so motherfucking shallow
One of you niggas is finna die though
Carry the body up out the backdoor
Get rid of every witness since you was my own shadow
Never tell em how you got it coming in
Niggas can't hold water they could barely swim
I push the turf from the track to the rim
Keep a strong body of work and I ain't talking gym
Pussy ass bitch know my block ain't safe
You a hostage now that I'm surrounding yo place
30G Rolex so my time won't waste
Then I crack the iPhone so the cops can't trace

If I blast that shit tonight I'm a get life
If my money not looking right I'm a get life
If I blast that shit tonight I'm a get life
If my money not looking right I'm a get life

Lay him down in a blood bath I be cruising on my own path
Think before you ever tell me shit
Beat a bitch with a selfie stick really really not that innocent
Me and chopper we get ignorant
You starve us and we star bust and snatch up your cousin
Get the spear men done , make a nigga eat the cum
Bullets feel like the sun talking shit you get plunged
With another shot,  gun so big, we can hit you from the yacht
I ain't gotta plot, get you on the stop
Punch you like a clock do not let yo goons scare me
Knock every last  tooth out I'm the fucking tooth fairy
Better pray to Hail Mary got blood smelling up the room
Air it out with perfume you gone hear that ga- boom
And won't see that nigga soon!

If my money not looking right I'm a get life

On the dick playing 21 questions
Like how do I feel on yo dick?
How do it feel when I lick
All on that cock do I get it on rock?
Can you sit yo ass down and let me finish on top?
It's not a sin its a blessing
You taught me my lesson
You ate all of my pussy and then you ask me for seconds
Wanna learn some shit just take classes
So cool with the shit I suck dick with sunglasses

Why play with dildos when you got a boy toy

Won't be a epic fail sick of motherfuckers give me ginger ale
Shorty pump yo breaks fo' I jump that gate
So you should just pass the paper
That other shit we a tackle later
Only how you know you getting real money
When you pulling out a calculator just to add it up
Got him mad as fuck bitch dont act drunk
Mama raise no punk ,give a pair cause I'm finna get payback
You see me cover yo face like a Arab
Cause I'm at cho head brain cells finna spread
And my fist won't stop 'till this bitch turn red
These niggas so bitter they Debo on Twitter
Might lay a nigga down like he just ate dinner
One by one they keep dropping
Dont need no chair to get it rocking
Knock knock who's there? Better use a peephole as a option
Only if you wanna be safe so many guns I'm a disgrace
Keep it brief if the money ain't the case
But if it is throw it in a briefcase
Try angels if you trying to keep them squares out yo circles Thats three shapes, situation need to be addressed ?
Then I'm a show up to yo address
I play a heavy part in these streets, but no I'm not a actress Just hush get that ass rushed if you say too much
Now you getting touched, I carry bodies out like a clutch
But not going to no fucking brunch
Murder scene look so disgust, but I did it like its a must
Turned the body to a pile of dust because I let it burn like Ush
I get so much hate cause I got a lot on my plate
You can tell by my weight I went from shelters to flying delta
Now I'm on a stage in another state
I'm 100 that I'm past ready I'm sauced up no spaghetti
You hang in a clique that's dumb ass shit that's Ed, Edd, n Eddy
Y'all washed bro, just stop bro
Motherfuckers doubted me and now they shocked bro
Cause I kept giving them the unexpected
Like mother nature in Chicago
Stop trying to treat me like the outcast
When yall be watching me more than Comcast
Y'all old as hell and broke as hell
In the basement living with yo Mom ass
I get slut shamed for the sex songs
But yo nigga up my ass like wet thongs
I line the chopper up then mess yo lining up
Now everywhere you go you need a hat on
They like ""Oh my God, she should be ashamed""
But I'm on every bitch account like a username
Now y'all can get back to doing nothing

"Reality, Pt. 4",Queen Elizabitch,2017.0,"Times changed was dealing with so much pain
But at the same time it's alot that I overcame
Went from hungry last year now dressing in cashmeres
It's just a bag  I won't brag cause I struggled the past years
I had a empty fridge would eat me a stale bagel
Thanksgiving Day with only me at the table
No friends or family, demons surrounding me
Sometimes I had thoughts of jumping off the balcony
But um, I kept chewing on Doublemint bubblegum
Leftovers in my stomach more like pieces of crumbs
Around the wrong crowd they telling me ""hit the blunt""
My father don't want me like we don't want Donald Trump
I was tryna keep it cool for my mammy
Them long lines standing in that food pantry
Wasn't a joke, losing my hope
Got bags under my eyes looking like a wrinkled tote
It was no sleep at all pissed in the bushes, no stalls
Found a home then we was gone then more leaves than fall
On my mama this shit was trauma
Ain't have a solid number so how could we see a comma?
While I was sleep it was rats running over my mom feet
Just so she could work to get us something to eat
Lets get deep, I'm hurting as I speak
When life paid you dust just get a broom and sweep
At 11 who you telling everything was hand me downs
Jumped and stomped by 20 people while others stand around
Nobody helped, everyday I felt invisible
School so grimy the principal don't even got principles
Once I turned 12 it was all hell
Roaming the streets looking for D when I couldn't even spell
Fighting demons with a poker face like everything swell
Let's fast forward let me show you how my life has failed
Remember them nights with no lights or gas?
Washing up at the sink tryna clean my ass with cold water
My entire body was freezing best believe it
Jesus put me here for a reason
15, fucking on a man that's 35 good in the beginning
Then ate my soul alive fooled myself thinking its love
The way he layed with me
But all we ever did was fuck and went to KFC
It's sad, I degraded myself hated myself
All this because I wasn't raised with a belt
I know mama I hurt you staying out pass curfew
You deserve to sit back but I overworked you
Remember when my music got 11 plays?
Mama we here now these the better days
So I'll be damned if I let a nigga take it away
They body dropping in a instant like they break & escape
Never going back to them old days of seeing them low plays
So I entertain these niggas like I'm giving them roleplay
The greatest things comes to the ones that waited gotta be patient
It's about organization all my albums got my wallet on Fat Albert
I donate to the shelters money, toys, and flowers
We was in it more than hours the feeling was sour
300 people in one household using the same shower
People got some fucking nerve to be mad that they rent due
When people out here on the curb with covers and ripped shoes
The homeless be the ones with good hearts I feel bad
Cause they put everyone first by giving away they last
Think about it!",https://genius.com/Cupcakke-reality-pt-4-lyrics

""It's important, abort it,"" that's what they all said

I can't believe this shit man, like a piece of fucking furniture?

I came across a nigga online that wanted my time
Thought  it was different but it was just  the same pickup line
He said before just to score trying to get my lingerie to hit the floor
Buff tough and rough he had my trust
Until his story got old and started to collect dust
The tea start spilling only two weeks in and got to replace him like a fill in
Screenshot is my witness he text me ""Good morning""
But also forward it to six other bitches
Yo bullshit I can't believe it
Dishing it out to me so get ready to receive it
This not a one way street
We argue over little shit like a link or a tweet
It start out sweet until he feel like you weak
Niggas always think that they smarter than Akeelah and the Bee
But they not , they really not
My position ain't to be in competition for the number one spot
Currently in shock while I'm watching the clock
Feeling like furniture in the house of a thot
Supposed to be my spouse should never have to ask you to take me out
Are you embarrassed cause I got stretch marks?
But I thought love sparks deeper than appearance
I wanna hit yo ass with my knuckles we a couple
But you got a couple Blacks and Jamaicans
Asians and Caucasians you dress like its a special occasion
I wanna go but the car seats is taken
That mean it just seem like a vacation
I'm yo bitch, but I'm sitting in the basement?

Apparently you busy it's driving me dizzy
Turn yo back on me then you turn to her
You don't take  me out you just leave me in the house

And you ain't gotta spy on that nigga
Cause you know where he at, yeah

There's this guy the limit ain't the sky
He gets more high when I'm with him every time
He shows me off, he makes me soft, he bless my sneezes and all my flaws
That's my dream boy (he is)
If you play me like a toy or take away my joy
(know what he'll do?)
He'll fuck you up like Floyd
The feeling when you found your soulmate
The feeling when you out with the homies
The feeling when you don't feel lonely
The feeling when you just wanna obey anything he say or do
Cause you know he in love with you (he is)
When you know his size to get him a gift or a prize
Know the brands he love and know his favorite shoe
I know he real and not acting (nope)
He takes away my pain like a Aspirin (yup)
Riding through traffic while I be in action can't live without him Like half of a fraction meanwhile if shit get wild
He the number one person on speed dial
I'm amazed how he keep the glaze on me
Never switch up his ways on me

He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving
He not out cheating with Charlin
Why? Cause that's my darling
He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving

That's my D-A-R-L-I-N-G
He makes me feel so damn free
D-A-R-L-I-N-G
He makes me feel so damn free

This nigga so worth this stronger than perfect
He never fails me the shit he tells me it comes from the heart
I can tell cause I never really heard it
Found a man that's not sneaky hella freaky
And he could get sweeter than kiwi
Ten times more times than a TV
See eye to eye like we watching 3D
What's good? Nigga come straight from the hood
Pants sag to grab the dust but he could anytime you ask
His hat cocked, on the block , but never puts me last
I'm impressed damn near blessed
He knows how to bring out the best, never play me like chess Call even when he busy working at the desk
How we manage, repairing my damage
I can bring him around my girlfriends
And he'll never try to take advantage (I love him)
Cause I'm the only lover I'm his phone cover
Show his true colors made it through the summer
Holds me like no other queens me like his mother
Say were not another were meant for each other

He got jokes like his name Martin
He a feed me when I'm starving
He not out cheating with Charlin

No Beat Necessary (Freestyle),UnKnown,UnKnown,"So you niggas yall know yall can't rap right?
So I'm a, I'm a break it down for yall
Punchline to punchline and teach yall niggas how to really rap
So niggas tryna make peace so let me send yo ass to heaven
And it's ya lucky night cause my bullets running out seven
Fuck you up with 3 up in your front 4 up in ya back
I'm like a Russian coming to America ready to attack
I ain't playing with no bitch no nigga no tranny no granny
No Jennifer Hudson but bitch I spray the whole fucking family
I'm presidental talk to me with manners, ""yes mammy""
Hit a stain, smack grandma with the cane
Until she tell me where's Uncle Sammy
I don't study no bitch, bitch I barely read books
I shoot your fucking hand off
Leave you looking like Captain Hook
I stay working like I'm starving cause I'm my own damn cook
And if you witness me to a murder
Ray Charles should of warned you not to look
Cause I don't like no witness or bitches who run they mouth
Cause if you talk that slang shit
Than yo ass getting beat like you from down south
Bitches chasing niggas with the cheese
Like they related to a fucking mouse
And I ain't talking House of Payne but we be deep up in this trap house
I give it to you like  a candy store do you want it Now or Later
I ain't shaving or cutting shit but I keep the razor and taser
When I say fax me that info that mean send me my paper
I'm a ask you what you want and how you want it
Like I'm yo motherfucking waitor
Niggas gone need eyes in the back of they head to know when I'm coming
Knock yo head back with one hit dislocate it and I dont do no tumbling
I spit that crack to kill careers and I ain't talking Whitney
Bitches be so old news like I'm watching the channel Disney
Where yo goons at man? I never heard of them
My niggas killing niggas dead on site like we in Ferguson
I swear to God I be hurting em
I pull up in yo hood blowing the snipe or rifle disturbing em
Bitches pussies having bad hair days put a hat on that shit
Like a abusive ass nigga bet yo nigga still hit
And I'm a break everything on him
Ain't talking skeletons but I'm a try to bone him
I'm taking niggas spots without asking niggas
Man my tampons getting more pussy than half these niggas
Young nigga don't be hiding in the car
Go take yo ass under a rock like that nigga Patrick the Star
And I could give a fuck about how a bitch feeling
Cause I'm shit and you hate it damn I'm something like chitlins
I keep my shells blowing slower than turtles
They think my bars be rehearsal cause when I spit it be hurtful
Got bigger eyes than Urkel I do construction
Bitch I be fucking drilling I'm in a foreign doing bout a 100 miles
Wack a bitch and never go to trail and if I do show up
Man I don't blow up put the left hand up
And feed the judge with about 100 smiles
Like a fucking street sign I'm posted up on every block
I been trapping and rapping since 15
And I ain't taking no fucking stops
I don't want him ain't cuffing no nigga
Leave the shit up to the cops wait, lets not speak of cops
Cause cops getting dropped like they the opps
People say they tired of hearing rappers
Rapping about killing niggas well close your ears and act deaf
Cause I'm definitely finna kill a nigga
Cause I ain't going I ain't going I ain't going nigga

"Reality, Pt. 2",Cum Cake,2016.0,"Yeah, so I'm back for a part two and I just wanna say
Please do not fucking judge me or matter fact
Fuck you if you judge me I think that's better
So listen, I say people barely eating so I thank God for this bite
No light food or gas but yeah I thank God for them nights
I always knew wrong from right but I never chose the right
Cause God gave my father all the good shit up in life
Cause man that nigga never helped my mama with shit
Wanted a boy but got a girl so told my mama ""kick bricks""
But speaking of bricks I wish I had a fucking brick to bust this nigga head until he dead for treating me like shit
But that ain't the case the case is why I chase
I chase my father down wondering why I'm such a disgrace
Man that's crazy and all these niggas tryna fuck
And girls like jell as fuck cause he took me out to dinner and spent a couple of bucks
But I could give a fuck about a nigga and his bucks
Don't need no drug dealer come talk to me in a tux
One week later want a quickie hold up nigga whats the rush?
Niggas want a stupid bitch to walk over and keep it hush
Well I ain't that bitch
So next topic, people getting toxic
I try to stay up in the house like a motherfucking hostage
Cause I don't want no drama grew up just wanting commas
Counting a hundred pennies tryna get a dollar burger for my mama
But the grind stayed strong mama ain't on her own
I plan to take us from the hood to a made haven throne
See mama all I got brothers don't give a crap
If I got shot up on the block they'd probably raise they hands and clap
Cause they think I'm real sluttish cause I do not dress thuggish
I wear that tight shit to keep these bitches mean mugging
So my bros think I'm a hoe fuck for money on the low
When 9 out of 10 a nigga wanna fuck it's ""no""
I got standards wanted to be a dancer , 13 years old praying for people who got cancer
But they don't see that shit but in my spirit I'm rich
Ladies time to walk away from niggas who calling you a bitch
Cause we deserve the best I  put that on my chest
So worried where he been at its leaving you with no rest
It's just a bunch of stress
But it's time for a change not booksmart but got brain
To tell my story once again part three full of pain

Hoping you would come around just a little more often
I'm sick of talking trying to get it through yo little ass brain
You just a pimp with a limp you just missing a cane
""I'm sorry,"" then you remove it don't win me over no more
She comment on more than 20 pictures so I know she yo hoe
We used to be comfortable and functional
Now I'm looking at cho face like it's pretty fucking punchable
Used to think a man like you never exist, two years later
Wishing that you never exist, yeah, cause I took a risk
Matter fact I'm pissed , so many problems
It's a lipstick it come with a plot twist
Don't wanna be with a man or watching more than civilian
You left my home when I was damage its like an abandon building
Should I leave or stay cause you not being real
Now my bestfriend on the phone with advice like Dr. Phil

Just to say we strong-minded, fuck a Easter hunt
Most women be going thong finding
Only to do what you can, we post to go hand to hand
Luckily I'm not the type to go from man to man
Hope your dick fall off for tryna wife plenty
You can spot a dirty bitch if she don't own a pair of white panties
Yeah, let it digest, think about it
Niggas don't be wrapped to tight might have to sing about it
Tired of sittin' by my phone, who gone text who first?
Just tell me the damn truth, I don't care if the truth hurt
You give a man the best pussy in the universe

Taking off like a Groupon (

Started upsetting they feeling vicious
No gun on me, but I trigger bitches (

I ran through three rolls of Scott tissues
In a matter of minutes tryna wipe the tears away
Don't want to be bothered today so you ain't gotta say hey
Fuck yo impression of me so much aggression in me
While bitches walking round like this a beauty pageant
I was arrested at 14 shoplifting, ain't have shit
Yo lets talk about the fucking hard life I had
Yall grew up in Nikes, white tees, and hell of Chanel bags
You should be glad you got a night pad
I couldn't afford a pad to put on my ass
So I was using my face rag
Yo lets talk about the fucking hard life I had
I'm out here taking jabs yall out here doing the dab
I'm hoping one day in life my father would take the tab for once
Haven't saw this nigga in months
Cause he out here fucking 17 year old's in the butts
What the fuck my nigga you so disgust
Bitch ass nigga you need some blush for making my tears flush
My own bro told me I couldn't rap but look now
Now I need to know which way to go for the next show
All the way across the map
""You just a lil black bitch who'll never be shit""
Remember that's what you told me?
But I am not buying that shit that's not what you sold me
And the way you beat my ass from one wall to the next
Really makes me question yo sex and did you do that to yo ex?
Or just that one moment you wanted to feel stronger than Trex
Let me know, cause what if yo daughter grow up a hoe?
Would you burn her with boiling hot water on the stove?
Or beat her like Kunta Kinte cause shes blacker than most?
You know what? That ass whooping was the best of my life
I'm feeling sorry for the lady you ever call wife
Cause I got a funny taste in my mouth
Like peanut butter on rice
That I'm a catch you slipping one day and I ain't talking no ice
And it won't be nice its gone get real ugly
You post to be the brother who love me and hug me
Not the one who picks me up by my neck strangle me and shoves me
I know you think I don't matter
But as a individual there's something special about me that stands out in circles like the donut wrapper
I'm a give you one second to count your blessings that you not in jail living in this house with you is so damn reckless it feel like hell
But I'm off it , keep calm
Hey Mom you really deserve every penny I make
When I look at you I see my mother and father lets call that a double take, you are so fucking great
You my superhero you carry so much weight on your back you ain't even got room for a cape

I wrote this shit in four fucking hours
No sleep, man

Let me talk my shit real quick, all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm 
alive
, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, ""nice tank""
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes
Let's not paint that picture, if I shoot, won't miss ya
Anything prior to this won't matter, man, I'm just tryna get richer (in the past)
Y'all ain't peep Richard Pryor, y'all brain flat, no tire
Now everybody tryna hang like a fucking dirty diaper
They like ""follow me for a follow back,"" bitch you follow me, then you getting smacked
I enter shit but I don't interact, never sucked up, I drink Similac
Shorty bluffin', ain't got nothin' in her pocket but a fucking cigarette (broke ass)
Ain't talkin' no massage when I say I'm 'bout to hit the bitch in the back (ah)
I'm always so prepared, I don't flinch, that's rare (you know it)
Them boys singing in Walmart, I won't move 'cause I'm never scared
Just know I ain't playing fair, I want a big wheel, no chair (that money)

Now ain't nothing working out like a fat bitch
We from a million person so when I'm a see you in person
I ask but get gassed like a catfish
See you not here for me, you here for the pussy
Building an empire but you focused on cookies
Got big balls to step out the room to take a call
In front of my face and still walking away down the hall
No shit nigga, this definitely hurt
Imagining you under that bitch skirt
Constantly want you by me, but you only supply me
With dick and more dick, you gotta get up my ally
Might wanna find yo mind cause you clearly lost it
Its plenty niggas in this market, I ain't talking 'bout Boston
I'm the one that hold you down like every fucking day
But you think I'm your sex slave from Fifty Shades of Gray

Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need
Now I gotta get rid of you, like an abortion
Cause you can't give me your all, you only give me portions
Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need

Until I accidentally clicked on your phone book
You got hella bitches with different ages
More numbers in your phone than the Yellow Pages
I won't hesitate to separate from all the drama
Steady saying you moving on, let me do you the honor
Accepted yo biggest flaws but you do me this way
Yo new bitch and little dick could really have a nice day
Cause I'm convinced we ain't meant
Need some space, let me vent
Got the details from the emails that you say wasn't sent
Damn brick got me bent, when I left that's where you went
So indirect like a hint, she want all yo time you spent

Gotta get with it, get with it, get with it before I leave
You everything I wanted, but not nothing what I need
Now I gotta get rid of you, like an abortion
Cause you can't give me your all, you only give me portions

Funny niggas, Jim Carey
Chase the money, Tom & Jerry
Hella bitches want beef but it get scary at my deli
I'll ride around throw my set-up I ain't never finna let up
Tell you once to shut up next I pin my hair up
If yo money big than I'm cool with you
Otherwise what I'm a do with you?
Bitch you talking to a animal and I'm not talking Dr. Dolittle
We draw so much money at the bank
I done made the cashier faint
I will smack yo ass so quick no love taps or no spanks
Quick thoughts its a warning do a hit & run in my foreign
Have yo body rolling off the fucking hill
Like yo first name was Lauryn
My niggas shaking up no salt shakers
I'll hang her up , don't call later
Motherfuckers don't get the picture
So let me save this shit  as yo wallpaper
Hear that ding-ding got my ching-ching
Take my nails off with my bling bling
Cause I'm a whack his ass with that big thing
He gone feel this shit in his ding-a-ling
Don't tell man this hell man
No talking bitch I'm not a salesman
I'll step on every porch on yo block
Like what up bitch I'm the mailman

Stretch his ass like a rubber band, I'll send his ass to the motherlands

Stop staring at me damn peek-a-boo
Poke any man no Pikachu
Make it two fades couple rounds
Rearrange your face transformation Tuesday
I bring heat so they stay pressed
It ain't asthma but I take breaths
I do more and I say less cause talk is cheaper than Payless
Roll, roll, roll the dope yank that nigga by his fucking throat
Show you something for I drop you low
This is why you should have never spoke
Line bitches up put em in a row
You pass broke you really poor more numbers coming

O.C.D.,S.T.D (Shelters to Deltas),2016.0,"I'm already bigger & better
My name big without capital letters
Try one of my fellas you won't see yo future
Go ask any fortune teller
I don't understand y'all hating ass
But I stay on dirt like I ain't taking baths
For all y'all bitches that's taking jabs, when you see this beam it ain't laser tag
Plots scheming have him screaming
My uppercuts will leave a nigga dreaming
The ruger got a bad vibe to it like it's been possessed by a demon
In yo hood I'm flying through
Pulling strings but not tying shoes
Wonder what my rhymes do get double money like times two
On a mission while I'm on the bike
Smoking niggas but I'm outta hype
Stay strapped up to put a bitch to bed, but I'm not talking like a dyke
My woes with me no OVO you don't wanna go toe for toe
Have your soul in the air like a roller coaster
Bitch I'm too much like a overdose

When I clean niggas out know it's me
Bag that nigga up like groceries
None of the cops notice me
Cause I cleaned the trigger OCD
Cause I cleaned the trigger OCD
Cause I cleaned the trigger OCD
I'm a come at where you be
And just clean niggas out OCD
When I clean niggas out know it's me

Everybody claim they know me
Cause I stay with bread like baloney
They say one thing but they phony, so I gotta keep it on me
Nigga run now or run later
All about my money like a fundraiser
Metal wound his tongue ,bitch I'm busting lungs
Choppa got his entire gums flavor
On it, my opponent shorty, think twice you don't want it
Even when I know you dead
One mo to the head shots giving you a bonus
Wack his ass got my shirt messy
Animal dead then my fur ready
I'm a cold bitch that get sweet at times
Damn nigga that's Burberry
If I ever feel like I'm at risk, just split his ass like banana splits
Check him for the cheese, mozzarella swiss
Got him nervous now this goofy got the shits
Fake friends, really don't need those
Only come around when shit hot like mosquitoes
Make him fold up like burritos
Gave him a chip tooth no Tostitos

When I clean niggas out know it's me
Bag that nigga up like groceries
None of the cops notice me
Cause I cleaned the trigger OCD
Cause I cleaned the trigger OCD
Cause I cleaned the trigger OCD
I'm a come at where you be
And just clean niggas out OCD
When I clean niggas out know it's me

Money,UnKnown,2012.0,"Ayo, I'm walking like a zombie, my money never sleep
Money come and go, but this is what I keep
They say money make you talk, but I don't say a bit
It's all over the floor, shawty can't you sweep?
I used to be poor, but now I'm never cheap
I stayed in the studio, never count for my peeps
I'm in the night hustlin', call me the Grim Reap
I said I'm in the night hustling', call me the Grim Reap

M-O-N-E-Y, it really keeps me fly till the day I'm gonna die
I'm layin' in my grave with my money on the side

I'm layin' in my grave with my money on the side
As long as I got money baby, I'ma still rise

I see a couple niggas tryna break all my money
Grown men trying to holla, even them bad homies
My pockets stay with bread, it ain't white, it's wheat
So bow down to me, niggas who tryna eat
Welcome to some competition
Never could you defeat, 'cause I'll kill you
And grill your body meat
My money come first, that's what y'all should realize
'Cause I'm that model type, while your girl shopping at plus size


I put you females in the back because all y'all do is front
It's not good to lie, all you little stunts
Females getting on they knees, just to make that money
But I'm just dropping bars, and making hella money
And you can't step to me without a job
'Cause I eat expensive food, not no corn on a cob
Man I swear I love the dough, I should've been a chef
Fucking with my money man get you put straight to death
Silly little hoes, dicks ain't for kids
They swear they getting money sharing 20 dollar ribs
Play with my money man, you might catch a drill
(Wait let me rephrase that) I might get you killed


Out here hustling man
Breaking these rubberbands

Sometime I feel like nobodys never here
Wondering should I love or wondering should I fear
I got a dream like Dr.King and Kendrick
Kendrick Lamar man the best nigga up in it
See I been homeless for some years no family would take us in
Bouncing through hella shelters wishing everything would end
Mama like Lord Jesus please just help us
But in reality he was the only one who helped us
I'm only 16 giving my pussy up already maybe cause I got a
  fucking deadbeat daddy
Some days I'm coming home with shit to eat
It's like everybody sitting on the bus  but I ain't got a seat
I was a shampoo girl but my boss kept fucking with me
So I quit but now I wish I stayed and let her kept fucking with me
Cause it wasn't no income coming in Dad you a pastor
But not taking care of yo kids it's a fucking sin
Sometimes I want the fast money like a prostitute
But them diseases they don't come optional
I try to keep my secrets in like in a box or two
But I'm a leave fucking for money to a prostitute
Not to disappoint anybody but I hate school
Them bitches hate on me and thought that I was never cool
So I'm a keep cool cause I could get rude
But I'm a move on and try to keep my ass in school
See growing up as a teen nobody liked me
Cause I'm that pretty bitch so everybody wanna fight me
I asked a nigga like ""can you get my hair done""
He said ""when you let me fuck I could get yo hair done""
And I said ""close the book that's the end"" never will I ask again A helpless ass nigga for a quick money loan to lend
But them the struggles  I even tried to hustle
Playing tough without the muscle  selling 8 balls into doubles
But they say it's nothing like coming home
So I came home and thought about my reality
I said I thought about my reality
One mo' time I said I thought about my reality
And wrote this song , PS",https://genius.com/Cupcakke-reality-lyrics

I'm out here on the grind for that instant guapo
You out here on the grind for a Insta follow
We cut so different we can't even think the same
Couple warrants for my arrest so I'm hiding behind the bangs
I'm David from the Bible known for that good aim
I bet money that yo money shorter than the name James

He had a gold mind on him even carried some fame
Walk up on me like ""damn you gotta ass, what's your name?""
Not can I take you out, come to my crib I wanna hang
See in my mind I'm thinking he thinking that I'm the one

I'm thinking, sex young nigga? I only knew you for six hours
I'm like ""lets watch a movie fo' this day turn sour""

I'm like ""who is she and what she doing here for?""
He say ""we finna have some fun drop them panties on the floor"" but in my mind I'm feeling like it's a crime
Fucking on a nigga in eight hours of time
Got a giant dick but I'm knowing that it ain't mine
He drop me off at home I'm waiting right by my line
But he ain't call he ain't text he ain't even send a pic
Wait he did text he said ""how you like the dick?""
In my fucking head I'm frustrated as shit
What about the movie ? nigga You only talking bout dick
See mama told me always get to know a nigga
And if he don't know you better fucking show that nigga

Don't need no petty ass options
My mindset saying fuck these niggas
I really dont need to fuck with niggas
So shout out to them bitches thats working that 9 to 5
Not depending on no nigga go and get it on yo time
If you asking me I dont need that
Stomp a bitch in my combats
Bands on bands, I got that
Whack a bitch cause I'm bout that
A nigga fuck with my figures
This chopper gone be his feedback
And that's coming straight from the heart
I got to feed the fam we can't starve
No days, give a fuck what you say
Just play yo motherfucking part
See I fuck around and just break your heart
I'm giving niggas no fucking love
I'm giving niggas no fucking love
And this is how it all  start


So ladies who take your heart might need a bullet proof vest
Cause at the fucking end we only settle for best
And that's them figures, figures, figures, figures
Over niggas
Niggas, niggas, niggas
That's them figures figures figures figures
Over niggas niggas niggas niggas
Say that's them figures, figures, figures, figures
Over niggas niggas niggas niggas

Simple As That,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'm the shit up in my hood toilet paper can't do no good
Basic bitches not understood fuck around mandown what's good?
No lie, let me tell you how I kill you bitches
One foot on the scene and my eyes be twitching
All my niggas ride or die I ain't even got to fuck em
Stay breaking bread I ain't even got to cuff him
Mean mugging bitches like my eye is stuffed
First time fuck with me you better count your luck
Niggas wanna eat me cause they heard my name
But I Tell em one time it ain't sweet in the game
Like Trina said I'm killing you hoes like Nicki said wrap your coffin with bows
Can't fuck with me if your budget low
Can't stop my flow red light mean go

Can't fuck with me simple as that
Money on my mind simple as that
I can take your man simple as that

Niggas on my heels and the red bottoms you looking too hard now we got some problems
I got four closest full of guns and bottles so arrogant I look like a model
Look at my eyes tell me what you see
A independent bitch cause ain't nothing free
Young and wealthy hella healthy, look at my ass yes it's hella healthy
Girls gang banging man they think its cute
Shoot them in they mouth put they mouth on mute
Dont understand me comprehend

Yo nigga licked my clit you ain't even know
Rocking Jimmy Choo's with my fit you ain't even know it

Fuck the price never care what it cost you ain't even know it
Got 2 racks for that show my trigger ready to blow
On a hating bitch you keep talking shit and I'm a knock her down like whoa!

Like the money game I'm trapping they ain't even winning
Never worried bout no cheddar yo nigga said I get wetter
I give him real good pleasure he said it don't get no better

Who Does That,UnKnown,2012.0,"I don't believe till I see it
Can't geek my head up I'm not easy
Step up your game when you talking with me
Cause I ain't got no heart so theres no key
You lying to all them other girls
Mouth on all them other pearls

Catch yo face up on the news
You lie so much you need duct tape
If you ain't got money never catch a date
