Who Got da Props?,Enta da Stage,1992,"Put up, what up, BO BO BO!
Suckers want to flow but they got no show
So I'mma grab the mic, flip a script, and leave ya stunned
Buckshot's the one that gets the job done
Mic check, I get paid to wreck your set
Get ready and jet, cause I'm a threat to your fret
No holds barred, and complete move fakers
Best to play the back and watch your girl, I might take her
If she's a crab I'mma diss her then slide
If she try to riff I got my Smith on my side
Word to God, here I come so make way
Rugged and raw, killing your set every day
Microphone check 1, 2, here we go
And I'mma let you know, who got the flow
Spitting my verbs like an automatic weapon
Suckers keep stepping, cause I'mma let you know

Who got the props? (come on!)
Who got the props? (come on!)
5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)

5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)

One Mississippi, two Mississippi
Sucker tried to diss me so I played him like a hippie
From the 60's, but I'mma get paid from the 90's
Quick to play you Little Rascals out like Stymie
Kicking flavor, with my Life Saver techniques
Guaranteed to move feets and I go on for weeks
Maybe years if my peers give me ears to fill
Lick off a shot and act ill, parlay then chill
See I paid my dues, now you can't tell me nothing
This is dedicated to the ones who kept fronting
The ones who tried to diss and pose high? Oh no
Just cause you had 'lo, see now I got dough
And I'm paid out my rectum, meaning my backbone
Grab the mic, flip a mad script to your dome
Suckers, I kick 'em like tae kwon do
Guess and 'Lo, from head to toe to let you know

Who got the props? (come on!)

I'm the rugged operator like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Buckshot quick to play your nigga like Sega
Smooth trigger-happy snappy, keep my hair nappy
When I swing an ep girls call me ""big pappy""
I used to play a game called ""Ring Around the Rosey""
But now I play the mic, that's why the whole world knows me
I'm sort of like a Chevy, heavy when I bumrush
You'd better bring your whole damn crew or get your head crushed
Sucker - cause I'mma set it off with one shot
One trigger, one nigga, 'nuff heads drop
Don't even try to play me out cause static
Buckshot Shorty, he sounds like an automatic
Rip the set, my friend's mad tight
Cause I rocks the mic and keeps the crowd hype
Straight from Bumrush, I crush and cause chaos
Yo, and I'mma let you know

Who got the props? (come on!)
Who got the props? (come on!)

5ft, Evil Dee, and Buckshot! (come on!)

One, two, melody shows
And before I flip a script you know I must keep you dozing
Into the stage of the Buckshot Shorty
Son pass the boom, keep the top on the 40
Never ever ever get played: KILL THAT
Bust a mad cap in your back cause I'm all that
Straight from Crooklyn, better known as Brooklyn
E loop the hook and, your whole beat's tooken'
Must take charge, bomb guard, I'm the man
Bust my plan, it feeds back on my fam
Once I cruise, pay dues, I never lose
When I break on fools, wake up, you don't snooze
Bust a move, I get smooth like Roadie
Kick it like the Four Horsemen, yeah you know me
Booming like a speaker with my 100 dollar sneakers
Baggy black jeans, knapsack, and my beeper
Keep a fresh cut, never see me with a busted 'fro
And I'mma let you know...

Who got the props? (come on!)

I Got Cha Opin,Enta da Stage,1993,"When I get 
bent
 I must represent, no question
Get up a dime spot and then I'm off to the dread section
Roots hit me off lovely
Coming out the spot I had to duck because a nigga tried to buck me
I'm easing on the Glock like, ""What up, hop""
Buck's pulling out on cops cause I want free Glocks
What the fuck, bring your bitch-ass type brigade
Hitting them all, hand guns and hand grenades
I resemble the man that's wanted for murder
Got your block locked down, so don't come any further
In my clip is a .22 dum-dum
Oh yeah, I seen your moms, I hit her off with a jum
You know what I'm saying? Fret it or forget it
I'm like the short and fly so I'mma still get paid, I don't sweat it
I'm every MC's nightmare manifesting
A little shorty pushing the fact that I'm best in
This shit called hip-hop, raise the throne
Kid, don't front, I got you open in your dome

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid

Rest in peace to my niggas in the East
And all the real niggas that was shot by beast
Around the way all we do is spark mad ism
Ladies be like, ""Yo, he's Buckshot right there, that is him""
But let's get with the cipher, kid, pass the eight
So I can wet my lungs and blow smoke in your face
Word to Jah
, niggas can't touch me, kid
Cause I'm too nice to do bids or ever hit skid
Fronts in the bottom of my teeth like whatever shit
On the real, gettin played, what, I never did
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real niggas
The field niggas get the muthafuckin ill triggers
Word to Herb, lick shot with my verb
And keep my hand on my grip when I play the curb
I never got caught by a undercover DT
Nah chill E T&T can't see me
You grab mics from the ones I left broken
Kid, don't front, you know I got you open

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid

Late at night, I catch a buzz, then I write
The type of ill shit to make the mind feel tight
And be wanting to battle like every five minutes
But I'm in this like Guinness so that ass get finished
Straight from the floors of hell, feel the flame
You faggot ass, I heard your nickname's Blaine
I hit your brain and you felt the pain, maintain
When it comes to a battle you know the Buck reigns
I overthrow the flow, niggas be like, ""Yo, how'd you do that?""
Bitches be like ""Yo who that, you're all that, yo, true that""
Never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it
I used to make money, now I just take it
I do what I gotta do to bring you to the concrete
Bucking niggas down cause they think shit is sweet
I keep a Tec whenever I'm in the projects
Ease out, then flex, in effect like Wreckx
Buck to your head, now die is my slogan
Don't front, you know I got you open

Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid
Don't front, you know I got you open, kid",https://genius.com/Black-moon-i-got-cha-opin-lyrics
Buck Em Down,Enta da Stage,1993,"Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down

To the weak, what we do, buck em down, word life
Each and every nigga whenever I'm in the sight
Let my nigga Dru peep your style for your card
Then I kick a verse and take a look at the God
God hit them niggas with a verse real quick
C'mon God niggas is all on your dick
You know what they say about niggas who ride dicks
Upstate niggas become chicks, word life
I ain't bullshittin, ask my nigga Buff
On the streets he was tough locked up he was sweet stuff
Shit is hot, word to Ma Duke
And get the loot from the man kick his ass with my Timberland
Shorty with the Shots that I Buck with fuck with
Gang hanger with the double-edged banger
And I got niggas clingin my drawers
Niggas fake I'mma bust a cap fuck that I'm breakin jaws
I'mma bring it to your chest like, wind
Fill your fuckin lungs up with all the bullshit from within
But I'mma put it back so parlay
To the weak in Bucktown all we do everyday

Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down

Niggas tell me chill when I kick it
Although my shit is wicked, 
it's all about the blunts and how I lick it
Or how I shot a nigga in the mug
With the slug leavin 
white chalk all on a pitch black rug
You couldn't tell me other word to mother
When I was 15 runnin around I was the real street lover
On the corner out shootin the dice
Layin up, gettin nice, talkin bout a heist
GQ headin up to one-two-five
Push up on a shorty lookin live on the prize
I couldn't get the time of day when I was Little K
Now you call me Buck so your lips wanna puck?
Fuck that bitch, I know your X amount of thoughts
But they call me Buckshot Shorty cause I take no shorts
Word to the shell around my chest
Big up to all de massive rudebwoy pon deck
So if you see a weak nigga speak to that bastard
Or I'mma hit his ass with the motherfuckin plastic
Word life, I ain't bullshittin

Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down

When I was in school I was a mack
Shorty was strapped with ill lyrical contact
Knapsack, filled with the shit that I G'd
And a nickel bag of weed, yes indeed
A mad little nigga runnin up on em all
Fly as hell, hit the park play the wall
And all the older people sayin Shorty's a bad-ass
But youse a smart little nigga so you gonna last
They knew the time and they knew the rhyme woulda
Hit you in at least four years, so I came to split ya
In the nine-three it's all about me
Ninety-four ninety-five that's my years fuck it I'm takin over
In nineteen-ninety-eight I couldn't wait
To get all my niggas and do shows from state to state
Now I'm the motherfucker that's givin instructions
Fuckin with them niggas Beatminerz on productions
Welcome to Bucktown, U.S.A
Where the weak niggas get this shit everyday

Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down
Buck em down, Buck em down

Aiyyo, this is goin out to all the real niggas
Who buck down the bullshit, you know what I'm sayin?
On the real, rest in peace to my nigga Butta
In Coney Island, shit is mad real out there
You know what I'm sayin?
 
Buckshot Shorty
Five F-T, my DJ Evil Dee
Mr. Walt
, 
all my niggas in the motherfucker
You know what I'm sayin? Smokin mad blunts
And just chillin. So buck down the bullshit in ninety-three
Ninety-four, ninety-five, shit is ours

U da Man,Enta da Stage,1993,"What, here comes the muthafuckin' 5
Pass the Crooked I, comin' straight out of Bed-Stuy
9-19, I believe
When I wanna puff a mad L I got the dutch hidden in my sleeve
Then I call my man Reels
Then we start the El Dorados and pick us up a fat bag of drills
Always keep the nine cocked
Just in case a nigga feels an appetite for some nice lead lock
Caught a nigga from a chin
Now his ass is in, hit the preach 'cause he said it was a sin
[
Verse 2: Big Dru Ha
]
Well, it's the ill Caucasian
, check the invasion
Bushwick to White Plains,
 the world in seven days and back
I'm down with the Black Smif-N-Wessun persuasion
Wanna flex next, swing one, that's all she wrote
Get the point to the joint, now you're bendin' for the soap
Like my bitch, fuck a bitch real quick, then I vanish
I always get the pussy 'cause I tell 'em that I'm Spanish
Chill, lay low, I'm throwin' headcracks in cec-lo
Niggas losin' dough so now they gots to bet a kilo
Mines for the takin', never fakin' when I kick it
Girls be on my jock, they want a taste so they lick it
Rip it from the back, bust a nut in her crack
Big Dru Ha puffin lye and I'm out, black

Now you the man, now you the man, now you the man
Now you the man, now you the muthafuckin' man

Niggas regret it when they get wetted with the automatic weapons
When I walk the streets I pack a 
Tec
 for protection
You know the deal, nowadays shit is real
Kid, I had it up to here, muthafuckas better chill
'Cause on the block, yes kid, we get busy
Front on my crew and get bust open like a fuckin' Phillie
Punk muthafuckers on the mic get violated
A rhyme ain't a rhyme if it ain't crime-related
I'm bustin' raps like a nigga bustin' caps
I grab the mic, cock it back and kick the fuckin' facts
Stompin' niggas out with my black Timbs
Leavin' niggas crippled with artificial limbs
A slug in the brain 'cause you tried to sham
You thought you was the man, you fuckin' coward

I'm with my ill niggas troopin' down Atlantic Ave
Three blunts still plus there's weed in the stash
Timb boots flop as the L gets sparked
Play the shouts from the street, it's flames movin' in the dark
I've had it up to here with y'all weak-ass rappers
Bucktown, home of the Originoo Gunn Clappaz
The name's Smif-N-Wessun
 and we're representin' lovely
Smif draws the 4-5th if you punks try to rub me
And I got his back, leave your body lyin' flat
It's time to knuckle up, guard your grill, fuck that
Timberlands bootin' up the ass of A&R's
You gettin' surgery tryin' to cover up the scars
You pussy old bwoy, bett'r watch where ya stand
Smif-N-Wessun comin', lettin' you know who's the man

Now you the man, now you the man, now you the man
Now you the man, now you the muthafuckin' man

These niggas is crazy, but I get real rough, no question
Runnin' with Black Moon, representin' Smif-N-Wessun
The boy's crazy, boys roll Mobb Deep
Bringin' Havoc
, so get dramatic and get splattered in a heartbeat
Bits and pieces when I release the boom
These type of tunes kept me consumed in a rubber room
Now I rock with Buckshot, what the fuck, ock
I got 'nuff props so you can get the fat cock

I've got 1, 2, 3, let me know if you're ready for me
Lawd, you must throw your hands upon the mic and let 'em know
About the flow when you rip and stick it 'cause you must get wicked
Never hesitate to big up a lyrical gangster, not lyrical prankster, see
Straight from the head of Buckshot hittin' 'em real irie
Mi never come fi short, mi a-fi shoot upon di mic
You gwan fall like di Babylon on sight
Taught by my nigga Screwface tie your shoe-lace
Let my nigga Bass tell me who take who place
Side up and up, side up and up, black
Yo chill, parlay, god, they ain't ready for that
They ain't ready for that
Everybody wan fly and get high but nobody wan die, why
Hey yo word up, kid
That's not that bullshit

Black Smif-N-Wessun,Enta da Stage,1993," (x8)
Anyting test man, mi clean fi mi gun

Here we go, break of day, with a mad lye session
Down in Bucktown it's Black Moon, and Smif-N-Wessun
Pick up the pace cause we're right behind ya black
The punk got X-amount of shots, take one to your back
BOO-YAA-KAA!!! Mr. Ripper did the shooting
Cops heard the shots, shit's hot cause they're pursuing
But it's my stomping ground where herds get blown down
Think I'm getting caught by beasts you's a damn clown
Check the drums of death as I break what's left
Of your face, cuz you're sellin out the rap race
Your family cried as your body lies in its casket
I keep a black Smith-and-Wessun in my polo jacket
Sixteen shots, for all you hardrocks
And if your bitch is a dime she can get the cock
Straight up and down, we two terrible toughies
The Vickster hit your pockets then I made your eyes puffy
What pussy? Better drop your mic and get to steppin
Before you're face to face with a black Smith-and-Wessun

Load the clip, bust lead to the head
The nappy head dread, Buckshot and Baldhead

Real niggas represent and don't die
Never dead like I said all we fuckin do is multiply
I puff a mad bag of buddha
Niggas be like ""Yo who the shorty?""
I'm bustin niggas with my six-shooter
I get so much pussy my dick be in stitches
Red-boned or even fucked-up black Zulu bitches
What? This lil nigga is a mad stalker
Brooklyn, New York will grab the leash around your neck and then I walk ya
If youse a bigger nigga bigger niggas get bucked
Cuz I'm the Buck and I don't give a fuck my dick you can suck
Buck is a killer, thrill a nigga like Manilla
I'm small but I'm strong like ten fucking gorillas
A crazy-ass nigga puttin Brooklyn on the map
I never gave a fuck, I never give a fuck, cuz I'm all that
I take no shit see, givin the Buck fifty
I even blew your bitch cuz your man tried to stick me


Ahh shit, a personality split
And I'm bout to flip with my nigga pull the trigger let the Glock spit
A little bad-ass shorty with no remorse
I kill forties and quarts remains on stage so who the boss?
Another boom blew up the scene
Throughout the planet, get green, now I got sticky mean with my tag team
G want a clip thinkin I'm takin this the underground moves
There ain't no more fakin if you're fakin I'm bakin it
Straight up and down, nuff respect to Bucktown
Home of the chrome, where I roam, not givin a FUCK now
Damn, just when you thought it was safe
To come out, with a rhyme, I got the nine to your face
Boom, hooked up with Black Moon, now it's on for real
So I pack more steel lookin for the kill
Hope you're not the picture on my scope, cuz the dread'll

Ack Like U Want It,Enta da Stage,1993,"Boo-Ya-Kaa, check my file and my style
Never on the Isle, Buckshot was a juvenile
A little freestyle fanatic, I shot the rap addict
With an automatic, now I got static
See back in the days, I was a stone cold hood
And now I'm just a paid hood, still up to no good
With my crew from the Heights and the Island
Still flippin' niggas, and we still be buckwildin'
I never changed, never rearranged my finesse
Buck one time to your chest, through your vest
F.A.P.: Franklin Avenue Posse
You can't stop me, cause my shits never sloppy
I'm always on point, I pack, a joint and a burner
Flip a scene, coming from a Teen like Turner
Take it from another brother coming from the ghetto
Once I get my ride ain't no need for the metro
I get paid to rip, step aside I'mma blow you
Don't try to shake my hand money grip, I don't know you
I'm just a hardcore, raw, straight from the ave
Leave another question and you might get blast

Act like you want it!
Act like you want it!
What! Bring the drama
Act like you want it!

I bursted in a rage, catching wreck on stage
Blowing up the spot, I leave my name engraved
You frail ass niggas want a piece of the 5, but
You can’t fuck around with the nigga that’s live
Here catching wreck, with the Buckshot Shorty
Spark up that L, cause it's time to get naughty
Then he looked at me as if I was insane
I'm just a real nigga with a lot on my brain
The pressure starts to build, when I grab the steel
Giving niggas the raw deal, with the mad appeal
This time around, I flex the Tec with ease
And if you really want it, I give an extra squeeze cause I’ll
Carve out your heart, and leave it pumping in my hand
Spit on your grave, and let you know who's the man
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
Cause, the 5 Ft. Accelerator, is at your every side
One time for your motherfucking mind...

Act like you want it!
Act like you want it!
What! Bring the drama
Act like you want it!

I ran to the boom spot, and shot the dread
He finished my nickel bag of skunk weed, now he dead but
Bust lead to the head, never did like a Fed
Rule with the mad tool, fool check what I said
I'm taking you down, I'm breaking you down, I'm real
Wiz, Tek and Steele, niggas, you know the deal
I’m for real no joke, soke on the gun smoke
Provoke, your dusty style, makes me choke
Never bite, but I write, when I grab mics
Boot your pretty bitch ass boy, and take flight
With my razor, the infra-red laser, blaze ya
Like cane, I raise your little shortie's bad behavior
Niggas better know when I flow, that 
I'm strictly business
And I’m in there when I flaunt it
Act like you want it!

Act like you want it!
Act like you want it!
What! Bring the drama
Act like you want it!

From the town where niggas always get bucked down
Kicked in the door, keep my finger on the pound
Word is around, that you're looking for the 5
Surprise, real niggas always survive
Don't be amazed, I'm alive from the flames
No need to scream now you're calling out my name
You little bitch ass nigga, you tried to take my life
Now I'm taking all you own, plus I'm fucking your wife
After that I'll have my man go and hit your only daughter
And leave her body floating in some bloody bath water
Just like a snake I hiss-s-slither on the ground
Nobody hears me move or even know that I'm around
You acting like you want it, now you're gonna have to get it
As I grab you by your throat, feel the heat as I just split it

Niguz Talk Shit,Enta da Stage,1993,"Somebody call the morgue, I just caught a DOA
Two to the head, I shot the bitch in broad day
No joke, I smoke gunshots you heard from blocks and blocks
I bust Mac-10s, oo-wops and Glocks

Bust a cap and crack a joke over your grave like Dolemite
Cause I'm a sick-ass nigga with no brains
Burst in flames, turn the mic into blood stains
Any thought I think, you blink and drink death

5ft. Accelerator, greater than your crew
Bring in your whole mob, motherfucker, you're still through
Yo nigga, where's my four-fifth?
I got more riff for any pussy niggas to forfeit
Bring it on, what, I got no shame
Buckshot's in the house and you know my name

Slow it down one pitch for that ho with the lick
Pass the automatic, I'm about to flip
And spray niggas with my vocal loco B comes express
Lead to the chest penetrate through the vest
And when I roll mad deep niggas back off
Fucking with Buckshot it's blood you cough
I don't laugh or joke, I never choke on a blunt
But I choke a stunt if it's beef she want
So bring the motherfucking arrow and I play Rambo
When I shoot the crossbow inside the ho
And her nigga, triggers I'm addicted to
Like angel dust I bust holes in your crew
You're wack, face the fact, you're all on my jock
To the um tic-toc, I don't pop
So yo make way so I can make my debut
I'm funky but you're Pepe Le Pew


Watch your mouth, nigga, I heard you're talking mad shit
If you're really on my dick, bend, take a lick
Here's your choice cause my voice'll break backbones and necks
Who's next to flex and feel the wrath of my Tec
I spray, no delay, more jabs than Sugar Ray
I murder then I drop dead bodies in the bay
Beats with mad funk, pop the trunk
Play my tape while you lay back, puff the skunk
I'm no joke, I flip the script like De Niro
I'm a four course meal, you're a one dollar Hero
I'm sorta like the mob when I get the job done
Contracts and all that, guns, guns
So stay the fuck back or feel the heat from my gat

Here come brothers who lyrically act
Hook: 
 4x
Boom!! 
(Repeat)

Some pack a mac, I choose to pack a black 22
By my waistline, buckin' your whole crew
I step through, and represent Black Moon
First, before I kick a verse, I puff a bag of boom
Lyrically I freak your funk you never heard
My shit is so fly, when I kick it, it's absurd
Damn, how I wrecked your life with one record
Made your crew break up and your girl get naked
Respected, because I work hard for my cash
Shakin' more flavor then Mrs. Dash
Look out below, my flow will hit your brain
I got dough, but I still hop the train
I'm bustin' niggas open, Attica style
Yo, straight to the jugular, brother you're mad foul
Gimme dap, because I rock with the best
Yo, peace to the hardcore niggas, fuck the rest


Fee, to the Fi, to the Fo, to the Funk
I pop junk and keep the pump in the trunk
Puff the skunk and get high, Oh lord
Get on my skateboard and do a motherfuckin' driveby
You little crab ass flea
Biting my style, you know the original rudeboy is me
Buckshot, no joke, smoke a nigga like buddha
Who the fuck you think you playin' wit
Yeah, I'm sayin' it
Cause I want beef, for you can hang here right
Yo, sometimes I wonder how the fuck you get a mic
But I don't sweat that, cause I 'm still paid
Niggas get bucked down, bitches get sprayed
I do what I must, just so I can make loot
If it's illegal, pack the gat son
You know how we do, true",https://genius.com/Black-moon-powaful-impak-lyrics
Slave,Enta da Stage,1993,"I'm gettin the ahh, I'm gettin the ahh from the
Weak shit that I hear no lyrical styles come near
To the one who boasts like Buck
On the mic truck, cuz I never gave a fuck
I hate the weak shit, man it be fuckin with my soul
I peeped how radio be trying to take control
Tellin me to get a little lighter on my lyrics
But if it ain't real on the mic I can't feel it
Straight from my bloodstream, I pump finesse
Nevertheless, hold it in your chest like stress
Rhythm and blues style is not in my environment
And when I ""slowww dowwwn"" it's time to take a hit
But until I fall off, call off your set
And if you never knew me, then you never knew wreck
Look inside of the mind and see
Cause you might be trapped with a nigga like me
I feel like I'm trapped in the motherfuckin cave
To the rhythm I'm a slave, lookin in my grave
Jugular vein bustin out my neck, you see the rage
I move when I groove cuz I'm into, the stage
Of the Buckshot, black, I'm bringin it back
To the roots, like Timberland boots, home on my rack
And I don't give a FUCK what you say
Commercial rap, get the gun clap, day after day
Niggas don't play on the d low, kid you know my steelo
I roll on more niggas than cee-lo
We might just bumrush your set
Me AND my niggas on the real mic check
Like my nigga Smif gettin swift on the gift
Then I toss another lesson to my nigga Wessun
And my nigga Five from the tribe of Moon
Pass the Crooked I, bitch yo pass the boom

Six feet deep in the creep
Mic technique got a nigga locked down for a week
Word is bond, shit is on like this
Gotta move, cuz I'm on a nigga hit list
You know the kid with the rock from up the block
Hit him up with the Glock now his pops on my rooftop
Ridiculous to think you're hittin me
You're not hittin' me you're gettin' me upset with the threat
But I'm a little nigga from the heart of Bucktown
My stomping ground is Brooklyn bound
Fuck what you heard, it's about what you hit
And if that's your girl, then your bitch ain't shit
Fuckin' all my niggas cuz they know Black Moon

Pump herb to my niggas from a nickel bag of absurd
On-The-Real is locked down, what?
Beast can't step one foot in Bucktown
Mr. Ripper; hit your back up with holes
All my niggas orgy mad loads

Nigga nasty-ass, sittin' all on my Bill Blass
I got a vibe in site, hmmm
Maybe cuz I had to get it on last night
With a nigga from up the block, who walked the rock, realer
But in a knuckle game; I'mma head swell 'im
And when it comes to loading clips
Niggas talk shit get hit with the Tec and the hip
Straight from Bucktown, U.S.A

Flippin the hook like flippin a book
Niggas know my style cause I be buckwildin on Franklin
It's time for Buck cause you're dead and stinkin
The original comin through with the boogaloo
What you gon' do to the crew, make way for the brothers who
Will quick react, bust a cap, breakin your back
And breakin the fact that your act is a shitty pack
You shoulda got with the Shot, lyrical Glock
Run up on your block with my trigger pon cock
So ease out, selector, play that shit
For all my niggas locked down, play that shit
For all my niggas Uptown, play that shit

Load the clip, hit em up with the back in his fuckin back
You better run, fucker
The original is a real gun lover, word to mother
Buckshot, come test me if you wan dead
And if the weed is good it gotta hit my head

What, picture a nigga droppin me
Ain't shit stoppin me, you're cockin me

At the count of three squeeze your trigger

rest the rhythm, I hit 'em,
 then I just split 'em
Best to believe that's the way you should've did him
Backing niggas down with the heat, feel the flame
Ripping through your flesh, can you handle the pain
I don't give a fuck, I never did, I never will
A little Crooklyn
 knight nigga with the skill to kill
Which to the point, I will extend the trey pound
Nobody makes a move, nobody makes a sound
Catch mad wreck, raise hell with my crew
Chillin' in the east as I sip on a brew
Drugs no frills cause the dutch is the master
An individual who blows up because I have to
Bust mad shots, it's time for me to misbehave
Whoever doesn't like it we can take it to the grave

SON GET WREC
SON GET WREC
SON GET WREC
It's time for you to represent

I'm a grave digging nigga that can hold his own weight
They tried to flex on the Five now they lives is at fate
They didn't think I had enough heart to set off the spark
I'm a shorty getting naughty getting ill after dark
My eyes are bloodshot red
All the hell I feel has set the stage
In my kingdom
And not your rule in every state
The war has begun
I'm about just blow, so pass the hand grenade
It's time to let you know
My feats, too deep, don't sleep, plus they real
Three slugs through your grill
The pain you will feel
Rippin', wrecking, causing mad drama
You acted like you want it, now you crippled like your momma

It's time for you to represent

Spread your wings and prepare to meet your maker
Fucking with the Five, I'm like your average life taker
Deaths in the street, in the borough known as Brooklyn
Where niggas lose they life and they get their shit tooken
Guilters run it all, don't even try to riff
Shoved down his throat was the nickel-plated fifth
Shoot out his brains, left them on the dinner table
Went home, puffed the herbs and watched a little cable
Just layin' back, thinking of the things I do
Throw on my Timberlands, grabbed my crooked eye brew
Well my man Dru, told him to meet me at the spot
'Cause things is getting hot, too many bodies in the lot
Just the other day they raped a girl in the exit
Put her in a coma, now she's three months pregnant
Damn it's so real in the heart of Bucktown
Make a nigga think before he dare fuck around

Back in the days we used to hit Pitkin Ave
Knapsack strapped on my back cause everything got bagged
In sight, when I got put out put up a fight
Then I took flight, all you seen was a streak of light
Ghost, you didn't catch me if you wanted to
I'm broke, it's time to catch some wreck, where's my crew?
Hit up the malet, fill up the pad with ease
Pump shit on the block and make at least two Gs
Sometimes I even hit the pocket, I got knocked
One time, two times, shit, they couldn't stop it
I had to make my loot, I had to make my dough
So I took my 'Lo and Guess, then bumped the rest
On the ave, it's all about the green
And niggas who make mad green know what I mean
So if you in the house and you know what it's about
Gettin paid, come on, let me hear you shout

Make money, money, make money, money, money
Make money, money, make money, money, money
Make money, money, make money, money, money

Take money, money, take money, money, money
Take money, money, take money, money, money

I got to get paid, and I mean quick fast
And if it ain't the cash then that ass get blast
Livin' in New York, nowadays, is like damn
Cause if you're broke, nobody wants to be your man
Especially the girls when it come to gettin game
You got to have the loot plus the gear to maintain
I can't take the heat, there's a strain on my brain
And when my pockets are broke my heart feels the pain
I gotta get a grip cause I might just flip
I'm thinkin of a whip, where's my crew and my clip?
It's a jack, take your fuckin hand off the wheel
Turn around slowly, bitch, you know the deal
(Shorty, you crazy) Nah, I need dough
And I'mma do what I gotta do, where's my flow?
I wanna grab the mic, flip the script and get paid
But if I puff a daydream, damn, I'm gettin played
Word to my meals, no frills, gotta go
And if you wanna bump makin dough let me know
I rather get paid with the paid program
You can keep your fame and fuck who's the man
I scheme and I scheme till I go get the green
And if you want a scene of the money fiend
Niggas let me hit the screen
Everybody in the house, if you want dough
You gots to let me know

Make money, money, make money, money, money
Make money, money, make money, money, money
Make money, money, make money, money, money
Make money, money, make money, money, money
Take money, money, take money, money, money
Take money, money, take money, money, money
Take money, money, take money, money, money
Take money, money, take money, money, money

I'm gettin kinda old, now my moms wanna flip
Up out the crib
, damn, I gotta hear the fuckin' lip
The house ain't clean and the rent's overdue
I hear the same line, yeah, ""I do it all for you""
You do it all for me but all I want is my own
I wanna represent, so I keep shit known
That I'm for the dough and nothin but the dead pres
Fuck Uncle Sam and the bullshit he says
You got to get paid says the man on the corner
See a fly shortie lookin good, push up on her
Now I'm like the man cause I bring home the bacon
Shit is mad real, kid, ain't no move-fakin
On the streets of New York, whatever you talk
It seems like only poor people eat pork
Word to my herb, make your loot in the spot
If you wanna get paid, let me see you lick one shot

At night I can feel the vibe in sight
Straight through the individual in flight
Everybody got hit when I bust heat, I had to let the 1-2 guage...speak
Why? Because we Murder MC's everyday, motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the under, whenever I see the wonder, I wonder
How, nuff punk niggas got caught let's start, the art is the choclate
I'm sparkin' it, play the quarterback, hut, so I can get a nut
And when I take a pull niggas your dead bwoy what?
I'm talking to you and your whole crew, pick 'em out
Whatever one you want dead first
Save the best for last cause I got a verse
That'll burst like Bubble Yum
, troublesome
Dumb niggas in the back on crack thats...
Hook:
""6 feet deep in the crease"" (x16)
Verse 2:
Thunder, thunder from the one
The original one to pack heat like the sun
Pull a gun, niggas better run, FAST, nigga what?
Nigga bring apon cock on ass
Look behind and feel the heat from the devil on your back
I'm pullin' a mac, hum, now learn your lesson, now Smif-N-Wesson
Recognize that Heltah Skeltah's on the rise
And you can look into the eyes of a devil
Motherfuck a 10% cause when I represent the 5%, the God's get bent
Shake from the right to left now left to right
You drop the mic cause you was BUTT, throw your hands up WHAT?
Fatigue wear up to here, no fear
Wear your TImberlands tie them up now we in there
I get no time to fake G's, come follow me
6 feet deep inside the creep
Hook (x16)
Verse 3:
First MC up to bat, Buckshot back never wack
Cause I can attack, distract
Black and original crooks style, no style is the bitch ass style
You fuck around and get the gun blaow, look at me now bwoy
Come test, get out the buddha, sees can make a man get finesse
You must be fuckin' with that backyard bullshit
Cause the large shit that I fuck wit get me lit, no doubt
A dime of that Hawaiian sess, make a nigga like me finesse
Forget about stress just parlay, play the side

Fuck it Up,Diggin’ in Dah Vaults,1994,"Call me, hits and say jack, cause I get no punani
Flippin' a script, leaving the sucker ducks behind me
I'm a threat to poetry, you know it's me
When you see brothers, running around, here now Duck Down
Here comes the Buckshot Shorty
Swingin' tracks, with more rhythm and blues then Berry Gordy
Doing damage, when I vanish an MC, and picture the dream
I'm a warrior, not Freddy Kruger Part Three
Slap that wack shit, you can face your arraignment
Life, I think you need some edutainment
Try to slave my mind frame, you catch a spazasm
Damn I feel good like a long awaited orgasm
I blow up like a nigga who doing life in jail
But failed, kick back and drink an ale
Yeah, I'm the man that control with this
Run with a crew, and in my mind I'm a soloist
I don't walk, but verbally break x
That's why I got nuff respect, in this profession
But all punk sucker ducks, still don't know the answer
To the question

How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up)
How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up)
How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up)
How we gonna fuck it up? (Yo, it's fucked up)

Here I come, with the mic in my right
To get paid, plus raid the lime light
For any MC, that's so called, gets the props
I rock hip hop, non stop, to give nots
I'm the man, the original
Straight from 
Crown Heights
, my life's subliminal
Make my mark then spark, intellect, you'll find
And give insight to the blind
I manifest the best when I step through
Five deadly styles, but I don't do kung fu
Give me the tool and I go buckwild
Bitches and niggas on my dick because I'm versatile
So if you bite, I'll ignite the dynamite
Battle words, and battles gone, but I'm not that type
But I get hype, when I write to a format
Produced by Evil Dee, so now it's all that
Watch your back, cause I attack
And if you ain't down with Beatminerz, your
Wig-wig-wack


Lyrical genius, mic Mr. Wonderful
I grab the mic and make it turn like a run-do
Known to poetic, to terrorize, listen
This is a call to other mc's, time to televise
A smooth black brother on the rap scene
Doing my best to manifest to the fiend
That I can finesse, and excel beyond any dope
Guaranteed to turn the party out
I light shit up like a professional mob hit
No competition, cause the rest is garbage
Yeah, I'm not the one to get played
So back up off my dick, before I spark my renegade
Lyrical melodies are chosen
I revise the travel, cause the rest had 'em dozin'
Off, I'm the boss, don't forget it
When I rip it and stick it, manifest to the wicked
And wow, I don't smile when I catch wreck
Fuck the body blows, I'm going straight for the neck",https://genius.com/Black-moon-fuck-it-up-lyrics

I woke up in the night
Grabbed my forehead
Wipe my forehead with the sweat on to the bed
Deep inside thought
Thinking of a way to strapped
And walk the streets without getting clapped
Just because I'm tired of fuzz growing in my buzz
I'm doing my justice, bust this slug to the ignorant
Who said I didn't have knowledge of self
So come and feel the wrath
So listen
First of all let me explain
That when i drop a rhyme I I make it hard enough to gain
The god is heavy
I blow you up like dynamite
Into my dome I let the L ignite
Fight, I take you on flight here
The war starts here

Motherfuckers dont play

The colored man is the obvious, you understand?
I kill him, and drill 'im in my Boot Camp
Who can't survive in the creek?

Stick and move
I bust your shit
Move and stick
It's the original crook
Stomping through your army, what!
Gortex to your head
Keep your eyes shut
But, I'll take you in consideration
My occupation is to bust your federation
With my ammunition
Flipping precision, being precise
He's right, I'm nice
You can check my status and my apparatus
See the baddest Buckshot shot the boodah
Murder hero to clean your pipe like Ruger
Smoke a bag of charm then I drop the bomb
Buckshot I represent the Arm Leg Leg Arm
Head, natty dread, boy big him up
Roll thick like syrup
Cause chaos and terror
Chorus
I had a vision
It appeared to me in the form of a devil
But the rebel wasn't there to see
For me this is the year to be
Head of the army, the follower must flee
And ain't no room for the weak-Fuck the weak
They get bucked down by my Boot Camp murder fleet
We come through, representin' on the regular everyday
Night time is the only way
The son of the seven, representing the Sun
The heatseeker
The cypher maker
Quick to take a
Sec to re-a-lize, I see right through you
Double guage
I'm pointing the rage at your crew
Blow your back out until your chest disappear
We blew the motherfucker
Now we outta here

Buckshot’s Freestyle Joint,Diggin’ in Dah Vaults,1994,"Sometimes you bark, and some of them they ride hip hop
Buckshot, bust cheek, my trigger pon cock
Non stop, when I rock, niggas be on my jock
So I got flocks to carry Glocks for the cops
Niggas know my style, cause I be buckwild on the Franklin Avenue
Whatever have you please, to my man, Yoo-Yoo, spark that L
Let's get with the buddha session, back a nigga down
With my black smith & wessin, you can call me crazy
Because I hate bitches, head to the neck to the leg full of stitches
Break you fucking down, youse a clown, with my tre-pound
Fill it in your muthafuckin' chest on the ground, get down
Nigga, don't try to fight back
You be writing rhymes, and I be like, 'yo, you ain't write that'
I heard it from my nigga, and I see him down the way niggas be on my dick
Because I'm like, yo, Mr. K, the original ill subliminal
Type shit, when I grab the mic, you be like 'yo, I wanna do hype shit'
Ups, ups, and aways wes goes
I can rock the mic because I got mad flows
Like, this, that, dilly, dally
Last time I fucked your fucking girlfriend Sally
In the alley, right up the anal
She was like yo Buckshot Shorty you bring the pain too
My type of ass like the glass filled with grass
When I'm on your dick, you know I shine like brass
Niggas on my dick, because I gots mad strength
And when I fucked the girl, but it bleed
I go to left, I never stop, because I can rough it the top of my head
Niggas be like; yo, Shorty, I thought you was dead
I thought you was the vein from the way they had you strained
On the last time, on the rhyme, you brung pain
To all the other MC's, like my man, Five FT
Niggas be like, yo Shorty, can you rock the mic please
Slapped on your skills, didn't think you had it
Your gonna shoot the mic, like my main peradict, on the mic
Give a check, one, two, to the head, niggas be on your dick
So yo, yo, just come and flip a script

Back up off this little trip
To pull the muthafuckin' dozen, give a dick
So, don't you dare, press your luck
The war has begun, and I'mma about to get in
Flip a script, pick a target & I shoot to kill
Cuz I deathstalk with the Glock strapped to the right
Prefer grenades cause they get the job, done right
I blow but sneeze, let niggas know what I mean
When I get mad, I go the muthafuckin' bloodstream
Bust a bitch in her throat and watch blood spill
As I get, an ill do, she die for her own will
I'm sending bodies after bodies to the morgue
And with an autopsy, somebody had a smorgesboard
Of jealousy, I feast the heart to body parts
As I spark up that L and get dirty after dark
One time, as I blow your muthafuckin' mind
It's time for me to get ill, and commit a mad crime
I went off throat, but, I keep the flow going
Keep it going, keep it up and going, and I'm just showing you
Just a little bit, of my lyrical skills
When I go with the skills that pay the bills, when I flip
And I rip, it's time to be --- ahhh, fuck it

Inside of the mind, I see
I'm the type of nigga that you call a mad freak
Cuz I'm a scorpion, Buckshot Shorty, be
In your fucking drawers, yo, sharp like claws
Always break laws, cause I hate the fucking devil
Niggas be on my dick, cause I'm a hardcore rebel
Look at the 85, you'se a dumb, deaf and blind
I'm the type of nigga, that flip the script, I hit from behind
Like my niggas Mobb Deep, creep on the under
Yo, where's my man, Mighty-O, pass the blunt-a
A nigga like me, because I've been ya man for years
Word up, I knocked out beers, and then we knocked out years
And all the type of shit, that we did, me just can't hang with
We grab the Glocks, bang-bang, bang-bang with
Niggas on two-third, word up, served
When we got fucked up, yo, we just smoke the pound of herb
We never gave a damn, we went blow for blow
Niggas were on our dick, because we're toe to toe
And niggas pulled out knives and razors
But we pull out the muthafuckin' infered lazer
Right to the head, now pull, nigga
I'mma get swift with my trigger, take a swig of the 40
On the block, to park the yard
Niggas be on my dick because I say that I'm God
Why, cause I'm God, cause I manifest the puss'
What? And I'mma catch you down
When I hit you with the push in the mush
In the green, from the textbook
Like the Holy Koran, when I drops the bomb
I'mma take it easy, cause you not ready for me

How Many MC’s...,Enta da Stage,1994,"I'm takin ya back, come follow me
On a journey to see a for real MC
The mind tricks the body, body thinks the mind is crazy
But never sleazy when I get the flow, I'm Swayze
I break, you take
Whatever type of shit the nigga Buckshot makes
The incredible, lyrical, and original
You can kill it, bull, if you wanna take a pull
Whatever I see I attack, tack
Fuck up my back black, nigga fuck that
The devil lurks and my heart irks for the Hell
Look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
I hit my head on the concrete to beat the feet
Another dead nigga in the street
Bullseye, direct hit, don't miss
But how many MC's must get dissed?

""How many MC's must get dissed?""

I can break it down like whatever you want
You run like this, I hit but I gets bizzd when I'm pissed
Mister Buckshot rock it not quick
Bitch, get off my dick
I open up and boot em up then shoot em up, whatever
Im clev-ever cuz I wear my leather in the winter
I enter the stage, nigga cock ya gauge
I bust em off some'in awful
And then I leave the stage
Im just a crazy maniac murder a murder type thinkin
Ya shittin, ya ass thinkin, I see ya blinkin

But he was talkin' shit to my man so I had to get em
Yep, you can get the fist, whatever
But How Many MC's Must Get Dissed?


I got a nigga on scope through the eye of a needle
But I had the nigga pucking on my desert eagle
Pain as a nigga brain I'm goin' insane
Pound after pound and come stomp on ya brain
Pick up the route and be jetty wit the loot
Don't try to walk wit a switch bitch like you cute
You jus couldn't let me stick my dick and ride on the regular

Bundy, shut your fucking ass (Yo, man, we just recorded that!).  Yeah.  The fuck?

Look inside of the mind and see
Original Heads, check 1, 2, 3
Light ‘em up.  Hawaiian cess bless my mind
Now I kick the rhyme for the nickel nine, take a sip a wine
But E&J’ll make a nigga laid
Figured I stay to the blunts, save the liquor for my nigga Dee
I’ll represent the Original Head, killing
The original dead.  (Booyah!) That’s my nigga Dred
Blowing the spot (Blao!).  Fuck a philly
Five got the Dutch, Buckshot got the Colin Powell
Check my dialect from my diaphragm
You got your nine by your waistline, and
Me and my niggas don’t give a damn.  We got
The Bucktown, Boot Camp attitude, kill a man
Timberland make me General
Roughneck wild, big ‘em up now, Bob Marley style
Cheech & Chong style, light-the-bong style—that’s
Light at night, puffing the L by the River Nile
I smoke so much lye, I hallucinate
Ill visions in my head, everybody must dead
 (x4)
Killing every nigga in sight, killing every
Nigga in sight, killing every nigga in...

I wake up in the morning (We puff lye)
I wake up in the evening (We puff lye)
Check the blahzayblah.  I’m feeling the vibe from the rhythm and
The soul.  I pack a twenty-sack and watch a nigga fold
Don’t you hate niggas who make records for bitches?
It’s all about the blunts—fuck them stunts.  Now
What you want is what you get like Mickey Dee
Bitch, bend over, blow me so I can feel a breeze
Giving my enemies time to recollect on
The past, when I bust that ass, bass took your check
Figured I’d get bigger when I lose my beeper
Knocked your head plus knot your dread, all while you’re dead
We be I and I be we ‘cause we be family
Buckshot, 5FT., and Evil Dee
T-to-the-R-E-V and
The M-to-the-E-E-C-H-E
All my niggas in the place to be
Can I get an amen? (Amen!) See, we be...

Killing every nigga in sight, killing every
Nigga in sight, killing every nigga in...

I like the night if you like the night, ma.  I like
The night (Bitch-ass niggas, take flight)
You want your gun?  I got your millimeter, I eat
A sucker duck emcee to smoke blunts by the centimeter
Right away to serve the nigga on a curb
I love my niggas, so my niggas puff herb—now
My niggas, throw your blunts in the air like this
(Like this) Original Crooks never get dissed
If we get dissed, niggas get that to the back
5, where you at? (Right here!)
Another mission to be dissing, and who do I
Be dissing? (Bitches) God, fuck the intermission
It’s about killing the nigga, the one playing
The bigger, the one playing the sucker ducks with a trigger
I feel a bump coming on in the set
(Son parlay on the wreck) Fuck that.  Time to break a neck

Headz Ain’t Redee,Diggin’ in Dah Vaults,1995,"Headz Ain't Ready for this Clik we got
Headz Ain't Ready man I swear they not

Nowadays I had it up to here, from my chest to my head
When the buddha bless bless my head then the eyes are red
Coming for ya, 3-2-1 nice to know ya
You wanted to pop junk
So now it's like a little Vigor
I outta floor ya

Heads ain't ready got the original guns and machetes
I pen that ass to the grass like I was Teddy
Cause brothers ain't ready for the fros and the dreads
Grab the Glock and hit ya from ya toes to ya head

There's an X amount of yar-we, yo pass the gar-weed
Pass it over here so I can get Irie-why we
Smoke so much brothers be asking
Why the Originoo Gunn Clappaz keep on clapping

Heads ain't ready for what my clique got in store
Cause what we got in store keeps us prepared for the war
Shows get blown, hoes get thrown out the room
Plus napkins for nitwits that ride these from now 'til noon
Now assume - position, punks pissing they pants
Cause lyrical skills is making you feel..

Still if-in-case you didn't know how we be livin
It's in, my nature to keep Robin like Givens
For real doe, bring your steel bro'
Kill or be killed jerk - you don't know
So that leaves ya screwed like a dildo
I still blow, punks I crush into dust
Plus we got ya bucks (Who the warriors?)
Rock and Ruck, and what?


What's that aroma in the air? Trees
So what that means son?
Son that mean it's huntin season
Time to stack papes do you got what it takes
Can you react when your life's at stake?
I rock the stripes of an M-P, pon my timb tree
And keep the Taurus for my enemies
Whenever he comes in the mist of this Boot Camp Clik
It gets realer so watch Steele serve justice
Thirty-two degrees freeze until
These MC's decide to relieve you of grievin

On my way from out of state, I hit my block F-A-P
Wit my man Ruck and my man Rock S-T
Jus left my man brown nose
Now we got a sack of the black for the shows
Clothes, ain't really nothing to me
But I stay with my Timberland tree, and my
B-double-O-T-C
Rock, the party, keep my hair notty
Did you notice me flowing with potency
Buckshot b-d-b-d and the Evil Dee, we rock fluently


Mr. McGee don't get me angry (why?)
You wouldn't like it when I'm angry
Ill thoughts to the dome start to change me
Rearrange the, way I be kicking, my flavor
Even my neighbours
Notice a change in the Ruckus behaviour

Now you roaches don't even come close or approach this
What I be smoking leave your monkey ass choking
Straight from yardie like the one Robert Marley
You hardly ever saw me witout a bag of that bomb weed
I wake up in the morning and chocolate's what starts it
Reaching in my pocket for the roach to spark it

I'm steppin in hotter this year
Wit my bredern dry-tear, my cousin wit no fear
So who - wanna come tess Top Dawg
They dig you out the ditch and then they take you to the morgue

Here's Mr. Meaner, the crook with the mouth full
Known for being live and rocking those flavor Timbos
Half pass Lincoln, clothes dead and stinking
Country boy got me just zoning and thinking
Time to start stacking on you crab ass snakes
Gotta move right, cause my rep's at stake
Call up my dogs that's quick to bust
P.N.C. take it back to the dust
Now I got four eyes to watch my back
Plus my own two make it a full six-pack
Now we bring the ruckus to wannabe nuccas
Bodying suckas like I change up my chuckas

Don't you know the W-a-r (war)
Is o-n (on) open to them heads scoping
Hoping they can get a bite, and write what I write
But they don't know the night
Keeps me and my Clik air tight (right)
All you biters wanna chunk the script
But your quick to take a flick
By my side as you take my hand, giving the fake smile
But I peeped you for awhile
Ease off selector when the B.D. pulled your file
Can I pull your card again, the Buck's guardian
Is the Arm-a-Leg-Leg-Arm-a-Head
So begin to drop the bombs (Heltah Skeltah)
Booyah!

You ask for it, who want beef well here's war
For this I packs twin automatic 4-4's
Kids this ain't before don't even speak about my fleet
Many pop junk but front when them see me
Them not ready

Headz Ain't Ready for this Clik we got (them not ready)
Headz Ain't Ready man I swear they not (nah)
Heady Ain't Ready for the Clik we got (we really ready)
Headz Ain't Ready man I swear they not (nah)

Two Turntables and a Mic,War Zone,1999,"""Alright party people, it's about that time
We want everybody everybody off the stage
Who ain't supposed to be on the stage
And you trip over the wire, we gon' get Smitty to beat you up""

Just clap your hands to the beat
""Just clap your hands to the beat"" (6x) ""you don't stop""
If you look at reality, I bet you can't see what I can see
What could you see Buck, another duck
Gettin paid off the bullshit, what the fuck
Now, you can keep the ball if you want
But I'm gonna fight for the right in the name of the blunt
Hip-hop rules, can't nobody touch the flavor
Brotha, word to motha, tell your neighbor (WHAT!!)
That we do whatever we gotta do
God bless the budda cess and my whole crew
One thing I hate see fuck a hand
You and your crew bite my style and you play Teddy Rucker man
Timberland on the upper hand
See the future plan is to be the man on the mic, huh
I see for now I got to demonstrate
Hey, hold your head back and feel the weight, remember this?
Chorus (4x)
Two turntables and a mic (MIC!!)
One phat emcee on the set (SET!!)

Watch me blow your back out wit the verb
Herb, come test Buck you get served
Look, up in the air, it's a bird
No, it's Super Nigga and look he's puffin the herb
Sayin ""chocolate do a nigga justice""
Bust this, spark another session I'm lovin the mist
Contact in my nostril
Is a collosal emcee to recollect on set
The point is, you get biz on the mic
Like back in the days, niggas we got more like
Shit, today it take niggas too long to recognize
Just because I'm not commercialized
Or when I'm in your town I rock the underground
But you don't really know me
Cuz I don't got no bitches wit me that's ready to blow me
Half bud-ass yellin ""have a good time""
Nowadays I'd rather have a good rhyme
Chorus (4x)

Commercial rap get the gun clap
Buckshot, original mack I'm takin it back
Back, back to when the wack used to play loafer
Carryin equiptment, nowadays they gettin over
Sayin it's another form of hip-hop
But get dropped wit the ball, back and talk when you walk
At night, whenever I stomp I can feel the hawk
Inside of my chest, from the bless
What I manifest is what I bring forth
Hold up people, I'm gettin you lost, wait a minute
Remember this? remenisce?
Way back in the days when the battle meant whoever got dis
Now what they do is this, to ruin this
They put a commercial emcee in the business
To make a brother like me play the dugout
That's that shit, no doubt
Chorus (4x)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, that's what you been missin
Two turntables and a mic
And one phat emcee on the set, blowin up the spot
MC, DJ, this is how we do today
Niggas can't believe how we do that

Weight of the World,War Zone,1999,"What what what what what!
Chorus
Holding the weight of the world, holding the weight of the world
Weight of the world on my shoulders (rock, rock, rock, rock)

Yeah, I know you can relate to this shit right here
Feelin like you got a lot of weight
Sometimes you wanna bomb never hesitate, bomb first
Hold ya head up yo, get up yo
Got all these stressed out niggas with firearms
Prepare, get ready they about to bomb
First one hit usually an innocent civillian
Shot by the elevator dead up in the building
I'm illin' off the chill I got
Through my spine last night when I heard the shot
Took flight, cos I know that the Gods is right
Telling me you gonna make it when there's hard in life
And the stripes that you gain through the streets is pain
No matter how many motherfuckers is slain
Hold your head son, maintain
Fuck getting the tumour in your brain
Mutherfuck the rumour that you on came(?)
Simple and plain, like piece of the pie
It's the hustle to get yours, Nigga I can't lie
I'm addicted to the high life, the wild life
Make the stress go by easy, when the bomb right
Chorus

The weight of the world is on my shoulder
But, everyday I wake I find myself I'm getting bolder
As I annihilate, plus dominate
Thinking of ways to rise up, like a republican prominent
In the bomb state of thinking
Sometimes, life is like quicksand, if not watching your step
You end up sinkin
So pay close attention, don't be blinkin'
Cos you might miss the entire point of the words that we speakin'
Chorus x 1
Holding the weight of the world (bomb first)
Holdin the weight on my shoulder (booya!)

The weight o' the world's on my shoulder
I'm never gettin younger, only gettin older
As I, walk the streets with stress
Hold my head, cos the more I finesse
Tap the plate on my bullet proof vest, YES!
I'm strapped in tight
Cos I feel like some shit gonna happen tonight
I been eyein' a lot of niggas, closin' up
Eye on my jewellery, they frozen up (rock rock rock rock)
Wanna stick me why? How come?
Jealous cos my shit is sophis, I don't fuck wit' none of them
Commercial rap get the Originno gunn clapp
Believe me, stress on my brain, roll a sack of that
Shit that'd make the devil dissolve
Holdin the world spinning on my shoulders wit' no prob
Chorus

5 o' cock on the dot
I, I'm up performing callisthenics
While the muslims are making salot (?)
And the Devil plots
The pressures of life got me rock
Plus my ambitions fired up, I just can't stop
Been singing broke too long, time for a new song
Rest in peace to 2strong(?), cos reddaman is still new born
The world's been warned
You get tooken out like a pawn in this game
Or get caught flashin' and flossin' at fame
But, trials and tribulations force me, to claim what's mine
Plus blow mine, (mine!) meaning!
What I work and struggle hard for
To the end of my existence, yes I'll die for
The rules and regulations, all God's laws
Laying it down, under the ground
Until the surface hardcore
Pushin' to become a rich man once poor
Tell you to your face, you ain't ready for the war

Makin' it hard, handeling my business on the boulevard

Shorty all embarassed 'cuz he drive a Regal
It's a thugged out bucket
As long as you make money when you hustle, fuck it
It's the next man thought to bring you down
If you ain't benefiting, then you better slip in

So, pick your head up when you get up
And if you're feeling what I'm saying
Let me see you throw your fist up

Yo I jump inside my Buggy
Aiyo shorty wanna wish me luck, I ask
If I win or lose, will you still give it up?
She giggled and pilled off, we had to laugh
Buck sever before we dash, it's in the bag
There it go, the checkered flag
I'm neck and neck with shorty for a second

Flipped the entire car and caught fire

Givin heavy not a light stare
Concentrate to hit my target on sight
Now who gon get it tonight
A few bitches on my list now
A few niggas get me pissed now, but who gon get dissed now
First, I kick a verse for them niggas that thirst for the liquid
When I kick it, check it
True soldier, started as a teen in rap thing
Now I'm like the rap Don King
Blastin thru the city with, no car
While you drivin your city whip, where ya jar nigga?
*more ""one-two's"" scratched*

The problem is you didn't listen when I warned you
Now I took five step, now I'm all on you
Evaluated, elevated, escalated, exellerated
Even became more educated
Comin thru fully equiped, stick it to the script
Prepare for battle and war, causin the enemy to abandon ship
It's my turn to burn, the flame I desent like the sun
And catch rip with or against anyone
The heat is on, as knowledge is beein born
Creatin that electrical magnetic storm
Consistant combagin, do you really think you can fuck with
This intelligent team of destruction
Forever buildin and destructin
Maintainin balance in our cypher
Keepin a more flammable fluid than in your lighter
Got enough energy to incite ya, excite ya
Yeah, I'm here to take ya higher to the Messiah
And get my earth wind & fire, Devil's a liar
You best to beware of the soul buyer
Better drive the lead ya to damnation, cancelation
But every good is duck this God right creation
My get down is all in my mans for the station
Bring ya four universal greetings which be peace
Travel worldwide, leavin my mark in the east
Many fakes and frauds be gettin applauded
At least ya brain weight, that of distorted
Got my peoples reachin it when they can't afford it
Forgettin the true factors of life
I'm bringin this drum thru my windpipe
My shit is mad tight
Shinin the true light, boostin ya adrenaline
To take flight, Power Universals out of sight

A lot of niggas are jealous of Buckshot 
I hear it everyday on my block

Yeah muthafucka, thugadon till I drop
And what not, watch the spot get blown
Two heads flown, can't stop me now muthafucka
I'm in the zone
Baby you ready to go home, cuz I'm ready to bone
The don king of rap sittin on the throne
Juice truck, who's that? that's Buck
Representin N.Y.C., nigga, it got to be
Ben Frank, small but I got tall money in the bank
Strong arm them niggas with shanks
You better thank God, muthafucka, times is hard
Real niggas know shit stink


All my jewels cost a arm and a leg
Smoke shit right to the head
Nuff said, I'mma speak this
Loud voice, no choice muthafucka
I'mma break a meter, even if the sound don't come thru
I give it to you in a form a liquid you can drink too, think too
Got a mink too, platinum too
Buck is like a tank, and I'mma flat them too
Get that bitch talk, I put a cap in her too
Put the gat inside her mouth and put a gap in her too
What the dilly yo? I'm in it for the women and the profit
I just can't stop it
Don't knock it, I'm addicted to the Freestyle
Just like a drug, Buck the B.D. Thug bust slugs
Nigga what?
You get two to your dove, fuckin wit this nigga
I ain't no joke


Buck's no joke, I'm like smoke

Seepin thru ya pore, make you do your chores
Buck Buck smoke the spliff, dumb the ash muthafucka
Get ya clean the floor
See I gotta explore the mic, can't ignore the mic
Gotta be on tour with the mic
Rollin up the black from dust to dust
Buck is like a burner, cock back and bust
Four clip, ready for the bullshit
As soon as the target's on sight, nigga pull shit
Don't wait, aim straight, point it at his plate
If he die it's fates, if it don't wait
Nigga's don't know, Buckshot rock don status nigga
I'm a C.E.O. with the mickey flow and yo
Fuck around and get freaky wit ya main ho
At my show, nigga what

Twenty one gun salute, now you feelin me
Applayin the pressure, add a squeeze on the trigger
Rest in piece to Bloody Red, my nigga
When Brooklyn's in the house
It's time to shut 'em down

Billy's blowin torches at innocent bistanders on porches
So be cautious, ofcourse it's a war
Goin all out side, and my family refuse to hide
Till I die

Aiyo I'm on another mission
But yet, it's the same condition
When I kidnap ya ass, it'll be a rap dude missin

With the same aim, to splatter you
We happen to be, them fly niggas
Move with the 5 Footer, here come dunn-dunn
Move in on them with the rough cats
Let me ask them bitch ass niggas a question

What make you think that I won't ride and dump this thing on you
Rain on you, word on the street is they say I'm thru
But you got rocked, blood stain on you

Chorus 4X: Buckshot
Why the Devil keep fuckin with me
Why the Devil keep fuckin with me

Listen up yo, ah
Feel like the Devil got a personal grudge against Buck
What the fuck
Walkin thru the streets, mindin my biz
Fearin like the Devil know what time it is
Rollin my leaf, just bought a dime
Everything is spinnin in my goddamn mind
Hold up, wait a minute, speak a one time
It's too many voices in my head, I hear the flatline
Could of sworn I heard the voice whisper from behind
Kinda deep though, made a nigga creep slow and breath slow
Cautious, nautious I could feel it in my stomach
The Devil wanna blow the trumpet
Look at every step I take, I could feel it every breath I take
If I sniff up one time, I feel the earthquake
Damn the takes, so much to hold it all inside my chest
Feel like I'm bout to jest
Blow up, but before I do, I'mma take to them demoms
Schemin on whole crew
Chorus 4X

I used to want a Beemer, I used to want a Benz
One thing that I never wanted was fake friends in the end
I knew that ones that stuck by me be, was the ones that see me
On the streets, not TV
It's an everyday, it's an all day
Devils and the cops will get me in the hallway
Hopes drop me in the for slay
Around the third, because I'm about to blow
And be the shit, my word
I don't give a fuck, I ain't trying to quit at all
Even if my back is up against the wall, I brawl
It's a struggle in life, and it struggles the game
But whatever you gain when you at your worst at you feel the pain inside
That's when I'm near my goal
I could taste success, gotta stay in control
See the world's cold, momma told me from day one
""Prepare to blaze dum, play the game son""
As a juvenile, I always got into shit
Even If I didn't start, I was bound to flip
Gettin to me in the worst way
Shot my little nigga on his birthday
Rest in piece to my nigga Ray
I know the Demon want me next
I see you schemin on me next
But I'm about to flex, Devil you can check
Chorus 3X

I'm livin in the world, where nothin is free
Gotta pay the Devil even if I smoke trees
Oh come on now, is it on now?
Smoke my weed and the public put me on foul
When the judge lock me up I see the jury smile
Gigglin, finger wigglin, he gone for a while
Hit a nigga, what? your shoes don't fit a nigga
You just wanna get a nigga, I figure
I'mma be the livin proof
Hit them niggas, blow up like koof
Put your smoke inside your face like poof

Automatic gleem laser beam stop ya whole team, clear the whole scene

This regime, stay militant, givin it to each
And every inconsiderate fool, to act ignorant

My voice is back on the streets, home forbidden again
We gettin brains in the range, born bonic again

And watch your back for them bitches who act shady

Showin mothafuckers I be down for shit
Real quick to do my justice
Walk the streets and stay close to my musket
Bust this, everytime I hit the corner I notice at night
Niggas always wanna see a fight, crowd around it like
Cause a scene, some dumb nigga might pop off a shot
In the air for props, followed by the cops and the ghetto bird
Swoop down and hit them niggas while they standin on the curb
What a herb, kick off a shot in the air
Make the crowd shatter, kid you should've splurged
Now all I see is a fleet of DT's
Comin in the direction of B-D-B
Kick up dust, can't get bust, duckin darts
See they wanna shoot the god
Fuck it, they want to hit all of us

Bounce to this, in your Pinto
You can bounce to this in your 5 double-0
You can bounce to this in your Mustang
You can bouce to this, let it bang let it bang
You can bounce to this on the block that you on
You can bounce to this, polyin on your horn, come on

When a finesse pulled up in a GS
Double-breast to protect the lungs that I blow cess from
Yes, now I got time to press
Early visions in my head seein you in that red dress
Back door, it's the VIP

Rugged individual and make a profit from it

Yo, on the block that I'm from
Late night is a hustle hour
Anything gets sold, weed, clothes, plus the powder
Let's take a stroll, see what we lookin' at
Niggas used to cook up crack, now they learned to hack
2000 and up, what? Everybody got another
Scam to get a buck, Commander Lil' Buck
Well here I am, fam, damn
The pussy niggas with powers, the ones
Who put the paper to the plan, so I take it to the fan
Police wears clothes the way I do it hand to hand
Plus I push the land cruise, with musc-lin' from the mobs
Who told me, God, build on what you got and praise the father
Perspect, I started the army, now we up and runnin'
Look, you dissed me yesterday when I was off
I'm on today, and now you up and coming
What a shame, that's what dollars do?
What makes you think when I get on, I'mma holla at you
You see how we do, you see how I dust this

Right or left, life or death
I give you everything I got, to my last breath

Te fever's unleashed from the start


Let's take another trip, see what we can find
A whole lotta niggas, runnin' outta time
Everybody's scramblin' to get a hand in
Everybody throwin' bows, but nobody landing
My plan is, the fans and them, got to hear the new shit
From my mans and them, niggas that I move with
What's the movement, first of all, eye on the night
The rest of y'all niggas rely on the light
Light beats, light hooks, light beef and you shook
The rap game like the crack game, the streets is cooked
Believe me, that nigga sellin' you soap, we can tell
The way he keep the shit clean, that I'm sellin' you dope
So raw, so uncut, uh, you can smell it through the placid

Fell off, you can get the ball to your left eye
Look, ball or crook, where I'm from
If a nigga is shook, they call him a mook

And read a classic, Jimmy 'Fly' Snuk', give me mines look
Pots is not the reason that I'm out this time
For a moment in time, I'm takin' your shine
If we was a gun, you an uzi, I'm a nine
But I'm accurate, one shell will fill your inside
An my life skates, on anybody, anytime
Everywhere, everybody, any place
It could be a rhyme state, and we could battle for first place
But the loser gettin' two in the face

We not the average, what goes with us
Let's see, gassious, bullet wounds and cuts
Rest time for the Moon is up, fix ya tomb and buck
Little fuck, attitude, bossy
Only thing missing is the coffee
But of course, each are free, at the age 10
Seen my first coffin, but I was sharp like cleets
So I, stuck with the plan, fuck with the fan
Got a label, plus an office, and a custom van
But that ain't interrupt the scan
Cuz with no deal, my Set Dip like we fuck with Cam

We make records, you make raps, so stand back
You not on my league, not on our level, either homey
Please, little homey, you'll be


Aiyo, gun on my left and knife on my right
One in your neck and slicin' your wife
Then I, get away clean, put away cream
Cuz niggas might start hatin', violatin' the team
I'm blastin' the hatred, I'm blastin' the 8 shit
Niggas filling affidavits, off some faggoty gay shit
Go, four-four, nines snatchin' you bracelets
I ain't slow ho, listen, that's the matrix
Ok, I got mine, you get yours
Fuck it take ten paces, turn around and draw
Squeeze, Glock gotta spray, Doc Holiday, nigga
I'm your huckleberry, plus don't give a fuck if any
Nigga getting out of line, motherfucker is you out your mind?
I will beat fire and flame, when I fire the thing
Leave you laid out for the doctor to rewire your brain, P!",https://genius.com/Black-moon-looking-down-the-barrel-lyrics
This Goes Out to You,Total Eclipse,2003,"Let it be known, you can't keep a good man down
Hard time, hardly wear me down
The strong survive, what comes around, go around
When the going get rough, we ride, lord, hold me down
Blood, sweat and pain, take it and strive
Nothin to do, it's breakin' my pride
My eyes on the prize, been through, tribulations and trials
I realize, I'm still gonna rise

I need one hundred percent, undivided attention
Provided you mention, Black Moon is back
And all the questions, like Smif-N-Wessun
Changin' their name to Cocoa Brovaz, did it ruin the track?
Let's think back, like the song I made
So we can reminisce the rights and the all wrongs I made
Don't get it twisted, I don't progress shit
I don't remember, but I don't forget, shit
That's how the game go, things get harder to spit
What's real love, without pain, the part of the shit
Who knows, few blow, few will get dough
It's the reason so many rappers never move with the flow
But I've shown, that I'm prone, to keep going
Cuz I flown, this goes out to you
This goes out to you

This goes out to you, and out to you
Who didn't believe I wouldn't achieve
My goals, yo, I'm so, out of control
I just don't know

I started out with nothing, got a little talent
Came up with something, got a little violent
It was hardly thumpin', everybody fakin' moves
While I'm makin' moves and that party jumpin'
What part of me bluffin, huh? I don't see one
See guns, he run, leave sons with nothing
Stranded --- handle it, stress on my chest
Like a tight lamel lid, I just ---
Breathe in, breathe out, see what he about
And if there's no cheese, we leave him out
Cuz niggas see the route that I'm on
Big movers for the kid to rule, everything abroad
See I was taught to write everything I saw
Been around the world, from the US to Singapore
You can learn a thing or more, from the veteran
No calm, wanna learn no more, just get a pen


Me and Dru hooked up in '93
Started out as a management, then a record company
Even then they wasn't bumpin' me, but I ain't give a fuck
Still represented, every time I had to give them Buck
On stage in the studio, or on screen
They stayed out of sight, out of mind, if you off the scene
Knah'mean, I do too much for me to be enlightened
That's the reason, when you see me, you see me at night
Walkin', by myself, spliff lit by my lip, gun by my belt
Yellin' out, Duck Down is the label
Plus a million soldiers with me, nigga
Now that we able to make moves, and slay crews
And pay dues, cuz they rule
This goes out to you, this goes out to you",https://genius.com/Black-moon-this-goes-out-to-you-lyrics
What Would You Do,Total Eclipse,2003,"What would ya do?
What would ya say?
Once again
How would ya feel?

Huh, what would you do
If you walked in ya crib and seen ya bitch with the next dude?

I'd fuck the bitch and the nigga up
Figure what the fuck wrong with that nigga Ruck
Why ya trippin? You know the rules ya bitch choose me and that's cool
But why you fuck her in my home homie? Now listen
How would you feel?
You up north doing a bid and ya bitch ain't real
She ain't send you a flick of the kids
And she ain't send you no chips she done slid
And ya love her. Now what would ya say?

I'd let that bitch know Buck don't play
Go ahead with ya cut throat ways
Fuckin' every nigga, this and that nigga, relax nigga, she ain't engaged
Black tale of the month, she in the page, bent back
You going for ya gat? Now would ya act?

Now how would ya act?
You pulled over by the cops and ya breathe smell like yac
Ya seat belt is off, do you fold or run?
And ya holdin a loaded gun 

Man, I'd put my toast in my coat and splurge
Do sixty on that open curve
Sweat down my shirt
Can't get caught, will not learn
But I will not, will not burn

A yo, now how would it feel?
To be thirty years old broke with a record deal
And the ends don't make it no more
To the point you can't take it no more, get a job nigga
Now where would ya go?
When ya drunk as hell and the elevator's broke
And ya live on the top floor
Do you walk or say fuck it 'cause I got corns?

Now what would you do?
If you was broke on a Sunday until that next Sunday
Nice and fucked up, life is fucked up
You went from bad to worse, back to bad luck
Huh, imagine the life around us
Fake bitches countless, imagine you found this?
DVD of wifey in V.I.P, with like three, dudes 
Would you say it's cool?
But if you play the fool, play this fool
So you can learn something, smarten up
How would it feel?
All for nothing

What would ya do?
What would ya say? 
How would ya feel? 

Now what would you do?
You got caught smoking a blunt by the boys in blue 
Do you flip and resist arrest?
Grip the fifth and split his chest?
I don't know nigga
Now who in the hell, said you was nice and ya record is gonna sell?
Ya beats ain't shit and ya video wack
You give samplers and they givin' them back 


Man what could I do? What should I do?
Should I, get with you or get rid of you
I'm sick of you, it's pitiful what bitches do
Sippin on bitches brew with a bad attitude and a click to screw
Well you could fuck my click too
Plus the hill, one question
How would you feel?

What would you do?
What would you say? 
How would you feel?
What would you do?

What would you do?",https://genius.com/Black-moon-what-would-you-do-lyrics
Why We Act This Way,Total Eclipse,2003,"Y'all wanna know why I act this way
Why you act that way?
Why you act that way son?

Cus niggas talk reckless walking while I ride Lexus
Ice on the precious my eyes on ya necklace
Hit the studio, Corona, dime of black
In Arizona, crying for ya Diamonds back
You want me gone, broke so you can't pay nothing
See me don't say nothing, but you stay fronting
Now I got to do shit the O Strong way
.38 long way out in broad day
You gonna get me first, that's what they all say
E hit 'em I'mma get my dick sucked in hall way see
Nothing changes, Puff and Ranges
Y'all ain't doin nothing dangerous
Cus I'm not a gun buster, more like a conspirer
Killer hirer while you still an admirer

And wanna know why we act this way
Really, wanna find out we act this way
Act like you don't know
Who was there when Larry Davis blast po po
That's what you go fo'
Mofo I'm up in the streets still
Gettin up with Starang in B-Ville
He still that nigga, Originoo Gunn Clappa nigga
Who are you? Buckshot that rapper nigga
Pants low, boxer show, not a style for ya block to know
I don't wanna cock and blow, but she can get the cock n blow
Gotta go got to go aight so

They wanna know why I act this way
Yo why you act that way?
Why I act this way?

Yo I don't know why I act this way

Yo for real
Been like that since back in the day
We ain't got no time to play

If you see me and I don't give you dap
Don't worry I coulda been in a hurry or I might not like you
See I change like Michael but I don't mean skintone
Did a lot of traveling and been home
And I'm like word, I put it in work
And your excuse: Put it on him or put it on her
Shit, I concure you niggas birds
Pigeon ass niggas plus ya vision's blurred
Word, but you see me when you see me
Trust me real clear my gun you will hear
Listen I don't play games at all
I'm at the bottom where flames engulf
Ain't no love in the streets so I give hugs to my peeps
Plug the leaks, slugs in cheeks
Better have one in your Jeep cuz
We wild out in the street cuz
Cus niggas trying to live it up
Ain't got give it up
Knowing we don't give a fuck that's real yo it up
See me out in the streets ya niggas throw it up
Drive by slow in your hood, y'all bitches know it up
If I don't fuck with cha, it's not 'cus I'm blowing up
It's 'cus a nigga did a whole lot of growing up
When it was Nervous, y'all were serviced
And y'all don't purchase so y'all worthless
But overseas and on both coasts
You notice two of the dopest vocalists
So focus, Boot Camp Clik is here
And niggas ain't goin nowhere, goin nowhere",https://genius.com/Black-moon-why-we-act-this-way-lyrics
Confusion,Total Eclipse,2003,"It's just a day with another night
Another pray for another life
Another wrong with another right
Strong when I'm on this mic
Cuz it's always, a lot of confusion

Industry rule number 10 thousand and 80
Record company niggas are shady, baby
Definetly, never maybe, or have to be
A pain in the ass, like 'fuck you, pay me'
Crazy, picture me slippin', like a broke transmition
I got both positions, I own both the missions
I wrote poems for commissions
I'm the leader for the squad, when the Gods
In a hard perdicament, like
Got a hot group, but need they contracts right
Or got jerked for your publishing last fight
Now you wanna act tight, let me give you advice
It don't matter if you that nice
Cuz the bottom line is the kind of mind, not the kind to rhyme
Sign, and sealed, delivered, delivered and signed
Right now, I know you wanna get yours
I'm out my prime, so I got to get mine before I'm out my mind


Let's keep it real, y'all niggas know the deal
Rap on your LP's and don't own 'em still
Don't own 'em, chill, don't it feel
Foul, don't own your LP, but you own your bills, now
Everybody got a story to tell, or glory to sale
But alotta niggas bore me to hell
That's why the number one question
Where's Buck? Get the number one answer
Here, let's hear it up, listen up
Yeah, I'm back with the hounds, ridin' round
Cuz the hill look deep when you slidin' down, how that sound?
I'm from the Crown, plus parts unknown
Everybody who met me, took a part of me, home
Cuz I be fool droppin', never was with crew hoppin'
It's the true topic, that'll have y'all fools watchin'
Dudes stoppin', in the middle of their tracks, like wait a minute
Whose that, that's Buck, what the fuck?


From ya, streets to the industry, friend or enemy
In the end it'll be, who got it, who don't, who want it, let's see
Niggas say that underground shit
Like they don't want chips, yeah right, they don't want chips?
Let's get this straight, underground of '93 and '94
Ain't the underground of '98, I see it's too late
For y'all to relate, so fuck it
I left my show in the quarter to eight, a quarter to eight
And y'all can talk about me and them streets
Ain't shit to hide about BDI, I be in them streets
Back on my grind, this week, spread your little rumors
I'ma shut up, and this nine gon' speak
All y'all internet freaks and click-on thugs
On my web, get off my dick, you get no love
This ain't face, but I faith in the snub
After failin' with my OJ glove, show 'nuff, cuz",https://genius.com/Black-moon-confusion-lyrics

My man on the corner with a bottle of juice
Every day hustlin', botherin' you
Well, what would you do, if it came to you?
And the world put the blame on you, like it's your fault?
I was taught, no shorts, to take
Get everything I want and go for break
Go for broke, don't you know
Life is like one big door, closing slow
So, let's procede, gotta have probe bigger than the S.C
Or, M3, or Benz 3, or them three, or anything
Of them things, so -- let's get deeper
Cause life is dictated through a speaker
And y'all need ta, peep the, bigger picture
Behind that, reefer, every generation needs a
New drug, to me, that shit been bugged
Well, I guess that's how it be cuz
The world won't change, and you can't change the world neither

Every day all day, round the way
Gettin' chased by the rich, you wish

Got blazed on the strip}

And we won't stop til we make it rich}

Living in the fucked up city
Walkin', trynna avoid beef, from often
Hawkin', by the same little dudes with a lil' food
Got a let fed, now they feel a little rude
Fuck feuds, they don't fight, they fire
Cause they won't let Buckshot retire
I, then keep it going though
When it get outta hand, don't tell so and so
Fam, niggas be frontin', like they man
Wanna run to the cops, give 'em the drop on the shot
Damn, comin' out my crib, I seen two cops
Started wildin' out, thinkin' I'm 2Pac, bust 2 shots
Now it's a warzone, and I'm on the run
Plus I got a body on the gun, gotta call my son

Stoned Iz the Way,Total Eclipse,2003,"Stoned is the way of the walk
In New York, shit is real, number one, grime this meal
Now I'm for real, my mind's designed to kill
Like muthafuckas who behind them chills, and I'm still
Settin' it off, lettin' it off, begin it
Rough til my ending, leavin' in trust linen
Little Buck, bad ass fuck, whatever now
Got smart with the hustle, shot clever now
Set 'em down, make way for the king
Hailin' from New York, New York, the big city of schemes
Man, I'm mean, it's so many rumors, cause I
Stay fly, and do crimes, with alibi
That's why, y'all be lookin' like, y'all them Brooklyn Knights
You know the type, gettin' niggas on or off the night
So get on it right, cause we off the chain like bikes when they stoled
And all of my niggas like when it's cold
Cause in the winter, I begin to, alotta other shit
Now BDI means Buck Does It
Hennessey, you guzzle it, cause wasn't this, the recovenent
If it ever was, we covered it, we thuggin' it
Like Joe and the R, no film, but y'all can still get shot
When you pose on your car, slow up pa
You should get you dough up, pa
So I can stick ya like a blow up doll, now grow up y'all

Now let me show you how the East Coast rock
Better yet, how these toasts pop
Keep frontin', and your magazine team don't need those props
Only mag' I need is on machine gun tops, now take it back
You said something? I said it back
And next time it's a bomb, in your watch, when you send it back
We the true Men in Black, cause we don't wear suits
And ties, when we shoot you guys, in fact
It's still Timbs and Carhart jeans
With my team in the dark art beam
Man, you know how hard I scheme, to get cream
To get this far and come off with a jar of steam
That's y'all dream, shit, pardon me
I got to make moves in the game, give a fuck about losin' the fame
Better yet, losin' ya brain, the more or less, losin' ya name
Cause you won't be losin' no pain, who movin' this mayne?


Caught up in the street life, everybody think it's a sweet life
I mean, it's sweet, if you eatin' right
But nine times out of ten, the mind tricks the body again
The body go for the shotty to win
The brain split, ain't shit, niggas talk alot
But loose lips sink ships, and you about to drop
And I don't mean no record, be double o, be double you
We never know, he never knew, check it
Boots and jeans, all hoops and dreams
The ghetto model just to get out of the ruthless scene
We call the hood, so it's all good, I hustled up state
In the woods, with po' nine, put your face in the mud

I tarnish the armor, trust me
I'm just that nice, wanna cut me?
Adjust that knife, or it might get ugly
Cuz, I'm too close, to my gold equip
Wanna fight me, you might see swollen lips
Cuz I, get around like Pac, sit around blocks
Move with a crown on my top, they call me dotta op
Why? they know I represent achi
Not a song, not a flick, but you can stand by me
Cuz I, hold you down like dead weight now

No more Mr. Nice Guy, come what may
Gun hid away, in a hideaway when I ride your way
Hit you up, then coolin' casually, slide away
By the way, you'll hardly find me, out of haze

What I demonstrate, boy, I'm original

A mark on your face, you know that ain't right
Son, you ain't that tough, so
Stop actin' like you throw blows
I'm a gun play nigga, I stick a blast in
You a runway nigga, stick to fashion
If I go broke tomorrow, I'mma borrow again
Business is never part of your friends, but then again
It's a shame how niggas act when they approach us
Buck and Boot Camp, is like fuckin' with roaches
You need a black flag for that
Better yet, you need a black body bag for that

Dominican Republic, never heard of y'all shit
They dig me, cuz I did me, swiftly
Hit trees with my overseas mc's, then breeze

Is talkin', they love walkin' on knees
I cock and squeeze when I shower many
Show a little love, every now and them, if I was them
Fuck my enemies, I smoke my little trees
Show love to my seeds, and put my hours in
But that was then, and this is right here, right now
We can do it Apollo 10, listen up

How we do it, they wanna know
How the gods can flow, we bring the arsenal, they like
How we do it, we keep it crackin'
Ain't no slackin', we lovin' to make it happen, they like
How they do it, ain't no question
What we reppin', got them steppin, oh yea
How they do it, anytime you really want the answer

Rap is not a crime, though I'm killin' 'em
Fo'five millin' 'em, Dru, send the bill to them
So I can let them know how I rock dog Pepsi
And the sock, don't rep me on your block, dog
I do it for the indies, the independents
Who rhyme from the last penny, up until the last dime
I don't play games at all
I'm at the bottom where the flames engulf, brains come off
Brave us off, it don't matter, when ya face up north
It's no laughter

One time, duke, you betta know who you dealin' with
No card, this is God, you hard of hearin' shit?

Let it be known, Buck be ahead of the throne
The only nigga that's ahead of his own, I stay on p

That I'm all that, and they just jealous, and can't be

You call my name, (Buckshot)
No need for amnesia, I need ta, spit a sick verse
For you, set off your seizure
Shake ya body and ya knees up
Ease up, weeze up in this bitch
Spark them trees up, you look like you need Buck
Well he's up, in the crib, til you pay the kid
Pull your fees up, please, me with a visa?

But, I'm not a pastor, I just get dough faster
Than the average, has ta'
You play the wall like plaster, I play the block
Cops got a Glock, now they wanna shoot a shot?
But this is what I do when I make a stop
Get a spot at a vacant lot, then I make it pop


I'm not playin' with it, while dudes fight for positin
And stay in it, hit it with vinyl, make it final and spin it
Cause I'm comin' to get it, hungry nigga on line, you can forget it
It's a done deal, when I spit, I'm your
Royal loyal, fully committed militant mind
Ain't spillin' every time, bong bong, shine
Many niggas die for this, so I gotta survive this shit
Drop it hot and rip, poppin' blow the spot a bit
There's no stoppin' this, throw the lock, at a click
We shuttin' it down, I'm fuckin' around
Yeah, the fever bringin' plenty of fire to your town
Rippin' the flow, through the sound barrier
Strictly heavy artillery, air force carrier",https://genius.com/Black-moon-pressure-iz-tight-lyrics
Where it Goez Wrong,Total Eclipse,2003,"Dear Lord can you hear me?
Do I want them to respect or fear me
Nightmares got me sleepin' with the little shotty
Though I know I can't put the barrel to everybody
Pray for me now, what makes a soldier?
I know it's no breaths til beef is over
Keep your guns warm, my heart goes out to you Seth
And my cousin baby just died from crib death
Stay with me, just hit me on the celly cell
I know sufferin' and pain really well
If it don't kill you, it makes you strong
I think of the song, ""what's going on""
When it's going wrong

When I act like it's love, and I know it ain't
If it was up to you, y'all niggas would be throwin' paint
On my outfit, like he ain't about shit
Before you talk about shit, take your mitts of my mini fountain
See I had geeks, and all y'all really had was feet
And you ain't never had a beef, so why you had to speak
Fasten your seat, and I'mma take ya on a mission, nigga
I teach my own how to keep my own, listen nigga
Get the check, pay ya dues, or pay ya respect
Or pay attention, cuz I already paid the rest, to just
Focus on the god, as the God speak
Never waste a line like I'm sniffin' on the hard street
And as far as we go, you know how the squad see it
If it's love it's love, if it's not, so be it...

I put my love for boxing, into everything
I know the ropes how to read the scale and work the ring
I'm military in the mind, hood in the streets
Good nigga in the hearts, nothing bout me weak
I open shop, rent the blocks, and call the shots
You get popped, get knocked, co-operate with cops
I get live, survive at one sixty five
You nothin' like the god, I'm out raw til I die
Smile for me, kiss ya little child for me
I know the story, going to bed, feeling hungry
Wakin' up dirty, all eyes on me
Blinded thug angel til my god call me

I brought you up, from the ground up
Now you wanna run and say my sound suck
Tellin' niggas Duck Down butt
But ain't no buts when I come around
All you hear is the crowd yell ""Buck""
Get it right, or get it wrong
What's my name, Buckshot, what ya name
Not in this song, heh, sorry no props today
Hard on the stretch, fiends won no rocks today
Shame, could of been in the game, but now what
You shine for an hour, nobody dug ya style, butt
The niggas that be geesin' you up
Hopin' you hand them a piece of the cut
Jesus, it sucks, your reason, is what
You don't got one, big deal, you got guns
I got guns, be for real, we can get it on
Right now, but stack up, your money short
And I'm long right now, I told you",https://genius.com/Black-moon-where-it-goez-wrong-lyrics
The Fever,Total Eclipse,2003,"""Baby, here I am""

It's a total eclipse, all over this track
Once the, moon turns black, the shit is a wrap
Step back, and give this legend some space
So I can, set the pace, I'm not playin' with the case
Call me the, hungry piranha, spit it like the llama
Fifty calibur, ride the road like no tomorrow
I gotta, deliver it hotter, and hotter
Wicked like Chaka, who dealt hot? Lick you a shotgun
Nigga, I top gun, number one question that's asked
Who gonna stop son, nah, nigga, not one
Slaughter the daily order, leave you wetter than water
Rest in peace to my nigga Headquarterz
And big Rah Rah, AVK Crew thick to the sky
All dangerous, all on the front line
Heads up, ears and eyes open
I'ma wolverine with a guillotine, wicked when I stroke it
I do it for the family, the struggle of my life
Bought out the hell and the man in me
Being on top of my greatness, is where I plan to be
This is serious business, no time for fantasy
It's 5, BDI Thug and Evil Dee
Duck Down, cuz we buckin' the shot at this industry",https://genius.com/Black-moon-the-fever-lyrics
Thatz How it Iz,Total Eclipse,2003,"Keep thinkin' it's easy, like all you gotta do is
Spit a hot verse to get on, and cop them new whips
Hah, joke's on you kid, you hot on your block
But not off your block, you need to pay more dues, kid
""Hold up, hold up, rewind that, I want y'all to hear
That again""
Keep thinkin' it's easy, like all you gotta do is
Spit a hot verse to get on, and cop them new whips
Hah, joke's on you kid, you hot on your block
But not off your block, you need to pay more dues, kid
I know you wanna and shit, cause on the streets
Rap is bigger than crack to flip
You like, watch me turn the o to a ki'
In one day, and one day turn to one week
See? I know you love the chains and the jeeps and
Hoes in the videos, make it so neat, like 'damn'
All I gotta do is learn, to spit a hot 16, and it's my turn?
'Nuff la to burn --- I earn my dues
Wanna do what I do, nigga, learn the rules
Rule one, what's that, never bite, cause when you bite
That's like rockin' ya man's drawers at club night
Ill, dis-gusting, keep bustin' flows
You wanna shit like 'keep bustin', whoa
Pause, rule number two and three
Is the same as four, respect the laws
Five is, what you in this for?
Cause there is guide in this rap shit, this ain't no image, pa

It's not a game, in this game, everybody want bills
Everybody want mills, thatz how it iz
You can't explain the greatness, no fakeness
No imitation, thatz how it iz
Everybody wanna blow in the game
Some don't go long in this thang, that's how it iz
You can ask kids, the fact is
This rap shit, is not for the average

It's not about, doing a demo, and gettin' on
It's about handling business, being focused and strong
It takes, a hell of a lot, to make it to the top
Your blood, your sweat, meltin' in the pot
Puttin' in work, around the clock
See this shit don't stop, it goes beyond
Studios, and the press shot
Originality rules, when you limit the style
You seen the fa-tality blues
Either you sound like Kiss or Jay, but y'all not them
That's when you lose, drown in the pool, before you could win
This is a grown man's game, with grown man's aim
Not everybody blowin' the game, is flowin' the same
You must perfect your craft, if you plan to blast
Take this, as a little, lesson to last
Instead of, gettin' the gash, you movin' to fast
Cause your eyes are locked on the bling bling and the cash

Shorty, I ain't gonna do shit, cabbage you
Say you nice, when you nice in average
You need to get your own flow mastered
Cause son already blew with that flow last year

You claim you the nicest with identity crisis
Spit a whole heart to this jewel, cause it's priceless
Perfect to your tightest, your highest
Don't be a carbon copy, end up on the strike list",https://genius.com/Black-moon-thatz-how-it-iz-lyrics

Act Like U Want It,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Buckshot)
Boo-Ya-Kaa, check my foul and my style
Never on the Isle, Buckshot was a juvenile
A little freestyle fanatic, I shot the rap addict
With an automatic, now I got static
See back in the days, I was a stone cold hood
And now I'm just a paid hood, still up to no good
With my crew from the Heights and the Island
Still flippin' niggas, and we still be buckwildin'
I never changed, never rearranged my finesse
Buck one time to your chest, through your vest
F.A.P. Franklin Avenue Posse
You can't stop me, cause my shits never sloppy
I'm always on point to pack a joint, and a burner
Flip a scene, coming from a teen like Turner
Take it from another brother coming from the ghetto
Once I get my ride, ain't no need for the metro
I get paid to rip, step aside I'm a blow you
Don't try to shake my hand moneygrip, I don't know you
I'm just a hardcore, raw, straight from the ave
Leave another question and you might get blast
(Chorus x4)
Ack like you want it
Ack like you want it
What! Bring the drama
Ack like you want it
(5 Ft. Excellerator)
I bursted in a rage, catching wreck on stage
Blowing up the spot, I leave my name engraved
You frail ass niggas want a piece of the 5, but
You can't fuck with the nigga that's live
Here catching wreck, with the Buckshot Shorty
Spark up that L, cause it's time to get naughty
Then he looked at me, as if I was insane
I'm just a real nigga with a lot on my brain
The pressure starts to build, when I grab my steel
Giving niggas the raw deal, with the mad appeal
This time around, I flex the tec with ease
And if you really want, I give an extra squeeze
Cause I'll cut out your heart, and leave it pumping in my hand
Spit on your grave, and let you know who's the man
There's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide
Cause, the 5 Ft. Excellerator's at your every side
One time for your motherfucking mind
(Chorus)
(Buckshot)
I ran to the boom spot, and shot the dread
He fished my nickle bag of skunk weed, now he dead
Bust lead to the head, never did like a fed
Rule with the mad tool, fool check what I said
I'm taking you down, I'm breaking you down, I'm real
Wiz, Tek and Steele, niggas, you know the deal
I'm for real no joke, so on the gun smoke
Provoke, your dusty style, makes me choke
Never bite, but I write, when I grab mics
Boot your pretty bitch ass boy, and take flight
With my razor, the infra-red lazer, blaze ya
Like Kane, I raise your little shortie's bad behavior
Niggas better know that when I flow, I'm drinkin' gin and cinnamon
And when I flaunt it, ACK LIKE YOU WANT IT
(Chorus)
(5 Ft. Excellerator)
From the town where niggas always get bucked down
Kicked in the door, keep my finger on the pound
Word is around, that you're looking for the 5
Surprise, real niggas always survive
Don't be amazed, I'm alive from the flames
No need to scream now your calling out my name
You little bitch ass nigga, you tried to take my life
Now I'm taking all you own, plus I'm fucking your wife
After I have my man go and hit your only daughter
And leave her body floating in some bloody bath water
Just like a snake, a sl-sl-slithers on the ground
Nobody hears me move, or even knows that I'm around
You acting like you want it, now you're gonna have to get it
As I grab you by your throat, feel the heat as I just slit it

Six Feet Deep,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Verse 1:)
At night I can feel the vibe in sight
Straight through the individual in flight
Everybody got hit when I bust heat, I had to let the 1-2 guage...speak
Why? Because we Murder MC's everyday, motherfuckers don't play
Straight from the under, whenever I see the wonder, I wonder
How, nuff punk niggas got caught let's start, the art is the choclate
I'm sparkin' it, play the quarterback, hut, so I can get a nut
When I take a pull niggas your dead bwoy what?
I'm talking to you and your whole crew, pick 'em out
Whatever one you want dead first
Save the best for last cause I got a verse
That'll burst like Bubble Yum, troublesome
Dumb niggas in the back on crack thats...
(Hook:)
""6 feet deep in the crease"" (x16)
(Verse 2:)
Thunder, thunder from the one
The original one to pack heat like the sun
Pull a gun, niggas better run, FAST, nigga what?
Nigga bring apon cock on ass
Look behind and feel the heat from the devil on your back
I'm pullin' a mac, hum, now learn your lesson, now Smif-N-Wesson
Recognize that Heltah Skeltah's on the rise
And you can look into the eyes of a devil
Motherfuck a 10% cause when I represent the 5%, the God's get bend
Shake from the right to left now left to right
You drop the mic cause you was BUTT, throw your hands up WHAT?
Fatigue wear up to here, no fear
Wear your TImberlands tie them up now we in there
I get no time to fake G's, come follow me
6 feet deep inside the creep

Verse 3:
First MC up to bat, Buckshot back never wack
Cause I can attack the shrat?
Black and original crooks style, no style is the bitch ass style
You fuck around and get the gun blaow, look at me now bwoy
Come test, get out the buddha,sees can make a man get finesse
You must be fuckin' with that backyard bullshit
Cause the cord shit that I fuck with get me it, no doubt
A dime of that Hawaiian sess, make a nigga like me finesse
Forget about stress just parlay, play the side

Shit Iz Real (New Vocals By Buckshot),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Check how I kick it, when I was wicked, around the way
Hold my tech, when I walk the block by day
Drugs and thieves, hit the eve of the night
Boot Camp Clik's taking you on the real flight
Six feet deep in the creep
Come look me in the eye, brother, cause our mind must meet
Word is bond, kid, it's on like this
Move when I'm on my enemy hit list
You know the kid with the rock, from up the block
Hit him up with the Glock, now his pops on my rooftop
Ridiculous to think you're hittin' me, you're not
Hittin me, you're gettin me, upset with the threat
I be a general from the heart of Bucktown
My stomping ground, is Brooklyn bound
It ain't what you heard, it's about what you hit
Oh, yeah, tell your girl, to get a grip
Bluffin' all the brothers inside of the Boot Camp room
Kid, it's real, yo, pass that boom
Never parle' without a L
Inhale the first hit for original heads in jail
Then go for dolo, on a cool laundry
Shoot the wack in the back, and I'm aight all day
It's hot, burn this clip, ask the cop
Tell the dreadlock ,that I rule the block
Ease back, nuff man ah die like that
Lick x-amount of shots, black, in your back
Word to my hardrocks, on Franklin Ave
Feel the bloodbath, of the aftermath
The wrath of Duck Down, Bucktown is real
Word to my man, Five Feet, hold your steel
On a snake who faked the jack, yo, lift it back
It ain't where you from, it's about where you're at
So I wear my gat, whenever I'm in Bucktown
Kid is real, all you hear is the sound
I'm real, kid is real, kiss the raw deal
Pick up the trick in the back, by the field
On the word, kid is heard, in two third
Bump herb to my man for a nickel bag of absurd
On the real is locked down, what?
Beast can't step one foot in Bucktown
Mr. Ripper, hit your back up with holes
F-A, who G? Mad lows knows
All about the breaker of the cash
Cop back my Glock, cause I see the enemy at last
I got a vibe in site, hmmm
Maybe cause I had to get it on last night
With a punk from up the block, who walked the rock
Well a, but in another game, I'm a head sweller
And when the cuffs are loading clips
If the Gods flips, you'll get hit, with the tech in your hip
Straight from Bucktown, U.S.A
Recognize, then represent everyday

Buck spread love like the Pope but I never spread false hope
I bring the bomb squad close
Rock you with a dose of tnt
What you ain't believe in me?
I'm comin' back from of these who be thievin' me
I'm incredible also edible
Rock it in the stage show, see me in the interview
Wanna be worldwide but you get with I
You try, you die
Don't deny the fact that you got your back blown by bronoculars
The way I'm rockin' ya and drop toppin' ya
Nolo go for dolo and we tallyin'
All my outlaws form a rally and we bomb first fool
Pull the toll, see what happen if you hesitate
I cut your blood supply short, it's your fault
You got caught in the onslaught
(hook -- Busta Rhymes)
Yo in the onslaught your lives got caught
Now we can run the full court all in a blood sport
And while we hold the fort cut ya like live shorts
Feel the pressure burn wild like (comin' for you)

I used to sit back and let a lot of clicks
Get to my head, wanted to dead a lot of clicks
Broke wit' no chips, frontin' in the game wit'
A little record deal but still drive the same whip
It's a shame ain't it, the vision that they show you in the videos
Would really make you think that you got the ghetto, oh
Don't get me wrong, I ain't tryin' to stay
But yo, at the same time I ain't tryin' to run away
A lot of family get left behind
Back on the block still left to grind, some still do crime
Some do time, but no matter what
None of my heads keep an empty shell inside the nine
C*** back, Buck on the Evil Dee track and make the mind react
Smoke a fat one listen to Buck and get black
As a matter of fact
Even if you don't toke you can feel the contact


See you through the window to your rescue I guess you
Heard the rest do all that wackness but in fact it's
Sounded kinda good 'til you hear this phatness
You lack this, what scrap this
Record this, oh my Lord this is the warning sign for y'all
B. D. Wanna ball
Is you feelin' me? Let me know somethin'
And if you see me with you smoke well let me smoke somethin'
Pump it up like he, film me like Spike Lee
Body count like Ice-T, do it nicely
Hize to see the B. D. Buckshot rappin' he can make the bomb happen
All my heads stick to gun clappin'
Don't change, from my street cats to my man Starang
Bang, bang, yo, can you hang yo
It's your own fault you got caught up in the rain yo

Word up my nigga, see whatever they want, they get
Want me to flip? I flip
The rhymes I whip, hence back to Brooklyn in a flash
Thinkin about the weed and the stash, in the ash tray
Man I got ass on the way
Shit I got a call from Renee today
She got that bombay, I'm bout to put her on the block
Where the drugs and the thugs stay
Pick up my money and send her on the way
You know what it's like
I fuck around and smack the chicken in the breast
Chill, you can get wet by the Hennyville spill
Buckshot I still kill
Chorus 2X: Buckshot
You want some, you get some
I'ma bout to fuck around and bleed somethin
Don't start none, won't be none
But since you started, I'mma bout to rip apart shit

Aiyo, what ya niggas wanna do with us
Bucktown we bust, murder is a must
Everytime I think about commercial rap niggas
Leave the hood and scared to come back, niggas
I subtract them niggas, they ain't a part of us
He ain't a part of my click, don't even start him up
He rock a 10 Karat, we rock 24 all day
Still smoke in a hallway
And I make more in a day, then you make in a year
So why the fuck is you in my ear
You still think it's sweat now?
Fuck the beef now
Yo Louieville take it to the street now

It's BDB and Hennyville ya
On fire like cheeba, get ya girl scream ""Mamma mia""
Aiyo I'm out of Henny's World with the go cart girls
My niggas barkin, while some turn over and nerve
Too many drinks son, it's affectin what you thinkin
Stop dummin, don't forget we Black Trumpin'
Yo I jump inside my Buggy
Aiyo shorty wanna wish me luck, I ask
If I win or lose, will you still give it up?
She giggled and pilled off, we had to laugh
Buck sever before we dash, it's in the bag
There it go, the checkered flag
I'm neck and neck with shorty for a second
I wouldn't believe she do me dirty
She tried to ram my tire, caught the divider
Flipped the entire car and caught fire
I kinda felt sorry, nigga, not hardly
Sittin in the window, startin smokin Bob Marley

Showdown (Feat. Q-Tip),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Featuring Q-Tip

(yo) Aiyyo Buck, word up (get up in em)
Yo it's that nigga from the Tribe
Let these niggas know what's up son, aight?

Bounce to this, you don't wanna miss this, get into this
This is that shit that make em all flip
They all want a piece
Some keep a steady mind, some get geese
Now what be the shit that make them niggas think
When they ship come in, they ship won't sink
Everybody you meet on your way up, you meet down
So if you burn a bridge how you gonna cross town
Think about it now and cry later
A mothafuckin money maker so I die greater
And everytime I get them visions in my head
Everything is red, gettin high from the stimuli
Very blurry-eyed dred
Said to me, Buck da B-D-B
When you smoke your? Sensity? I hope you take out your seed
And watch your back for them bitches who act shady
Wit another lady friend that try to serve you wit gravy
Menage, I almost got caught, what can I say
Fallin for the lust, I almost got bust Friday
But safely so, got em by the most high
He's out yo, into some next bullshit, I'm like

Bounce to this, bounce to this, bounce to this
All my hip-hop heads
Bounce to this, bounce to this, bounce to this
Mr. Buckshot say

Hip-hop, set out in the park
Niggas comin through wit they heaters to bark
I always have to be around some shit
Showin mothafuckers I be down for shit
Real quick to do my justice
Walk the streets and stay close to my musket
Bust this, everytime I hit the corner I notice at night
Niggas always wanna see a fight, crowd around it like
Cause a scene, some dumb nigga might pop off a shot
In the air for props, followed by the cops and the ghetto bird
Swoop down and hit them niggas while they standin on the curb
What a herb, kick off a shot in the air
Make the crowd shatter, kid you should've splurged
Now all I see is a fleet of dt's
Comin in the direction of B-D-B
Kick up dust, can't get bust, duckin darts
See they wanna shoot the god
Fuck it, they want to hit all of us

Bounce to this, in your Pinto
You can bounce to this in your 5 double-0
You can bounce to this in your Mustang
You can bouce to this, let it bang let it bang
You can bounce to this on the block that you on
You can bounce to this, polyin on your horn, come on

When a finesse pulled up in a gs
Double-breast to protect the lungs that I blow cess from
Yes, now I got time to press
Early visions in my head seein you in that red dress
Back door, it's the vip
For B-D-B, classic '83 type jewelery
Sport gold nugget, fuck it
Rugged individual and make a profit from it
That's why I love it and I get mine
Promote the bump and grind, sippin liqour to a lime
Every girl'll be a dime, see it's showtime
And every mothafucker online wanna hit something
Niggas need to stop frontin

Bounce to this, bounce to this, bounce to this
All my hip-hop heads
Bounce to this, bounce to this, bounce to this
Mr. Buckshot say
Bounce to this in your 3-2-0
Bounce to this in your 5-4-0
Bounce to this in your 7-4-0
You can bounce to this blazin on hydro, ooh
Wha-what, if you smoke a ounce you can bounce to this
In the club you bounce to this
Up inside your sheet you can bounce to this
In the projects you can bounce to this
Fuck it, in the suburb bounce to this
Huh, in the curb you can bounce to this
Fuckin wit the herb, you can bounce to this
Wha-what, wha-what
5FT, Evil Dee, Buckshot da B-D-B
Back at yo' ass for the nine-now
Don't bite this style, mothafucker boo-Yaa",https://genius.com/Black-moon-showdown-feat-q-tip-lyrics
