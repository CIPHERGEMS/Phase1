Children’s Story,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989.0,"(Now here's a little something that needs to be heard)

Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
All right, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah
Here we go

Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to: good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said:
""Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said ""Why'd you hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (who?)
Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said ""I need bullets, hurry up, run!""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car ‒ a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing 83
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full o' lead
He told the cops ""Back off or honey here's dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't ya dare laugh
Just another case about the wrong path
Straight and narrow or yo' soul gets cast
Good night

(Knock him out the box, Rick
Knock him out, Rick)
- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird
- I know right what does he mean
“Straight and narrow or yo’ soul gets cast""?
- I don’t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something
- Well, good night
- Good night

Adults Only,The Art of Storytelling,1999.0,"Check, check, check, check, check

Well, let us skip the boring foreplay, I'm slidin' right in
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
My, my, what a nice apartment you got, Rick
On her knees about to make her fall too
All platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too
You got it goin' on
Now my mouth start foamin'
The lights dim, we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers
Stop
Knew she was joking
'Cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking wet
Already had her tit out
If I play my cards right, fuck her, dig in the hole she shit out
Rick, I gotta go, my girl's waitin'
She recaps, finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps
Breathed heavy, all mushy
Bitch swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle
'Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butt hole
Meanwhile, she acted quite passive
Lickin' the hun neck while lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame, nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be
The bitch went
Ahh, Rick, it hurts, take it out of me
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers
You wanna keep it down? I mean, I do have neighbors
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her
Felt real good, my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bulldozer boring her
Squealing about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (Here)
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (Where?)

So, girls, when we kiss and we cuddle
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butt hole

Another girl I met, her experience vast
Because most girls with kids done been hit in they ass before
Picked her up, sunset
Don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringin' honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinking how to fuck the ass so plottin'
Blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowing that her butt I wanna bore
I said, ""Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door?""
Uhhmm, Oh yeah
Although The Ruler tried not to push hard
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus
Deep down I know she also wanna fuck
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin'
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin'
And expose my espresso, suck on her and lick on her
Unbucklin' pullin' out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy, kinda fat
Spun around, start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out
Still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, she said ""Pardon the puddle""
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole
Uhhmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went, ""Ahh, ahh""
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin'
Felt fantastic, she said
""Rick, I'm not really into this ass kick""
Meanwhile, Rick cummin' by the gallon
Put your hands on the wall, please
And try and keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her
'Til sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her
I almost picked her up with these final grinds in her

So, girls, when we kiss and we cuddle
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butt hole

My ass, more, more, more",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-adults-only-lyrics
Indian Girl - An Adult Story,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989.0,"(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier, yeah
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier
Well he's in Indian Town and what spots his eye?
A nice looking Indian and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said ""Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?""
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said, ""Why do ask? You got your own Timex""
To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded
It seemed like her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
""I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you""
He said ""I'm Dave, with crazy clout""
""Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner
""
(Singing)
Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier
Well, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti
He said ""What's for dinner?"" ""Soup and spaghetti""
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they was chilling in the bedroom
Sitting at the window looking at the Moon
Nothing was being said so he swore she was hot
He said ""Are you in the mood?"" She said ""No I'm not""
From what he believes and from what he gets
When a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said: 
(singing) ""I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude
But I'm in the mood for love""
And the she said ""Oh Dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, first close the curtain
""
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers
""Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. Stop""
Well, he was playing with her tits, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said ""Stop, stop.""
He said, ""Are you talking sex or what?""
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you knew she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
""Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry""
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning
(Yawning sounds)
He said ""What? Wait"" 
His dick went weak
It said ""Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak""
He took all his clothes he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with spears and Indian drums!
They's going:

Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young world

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
Broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love, peace, happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed...
 
ay it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid going wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non fool.. your life don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves 'cause... hey, they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks' too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, 'cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
You know, you know what, you know what?
We like to party (Hey young world, the world is yours)

You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
""Yo peep this""

Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a dollar... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Why? Because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
Steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some
 
dust,
 and
Plus, I must say... big shot, you're not
Your friends are talking and I'm hearing that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a job
You see you're actin like this urge is demanding
C'mon, wake up... have some understanding
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... it's time trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you
, he
Guides you... 
and he watched you as you grew, plus
Past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
So be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate, hate, hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, 'cause that's a man... that's brains, no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
'Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true

You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party
You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party

Mona Lisa,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989.0,"[Intro: 
Ricky Walters
 & 
Slick Rick
]
Ladies, and gentlemen... and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure
That we are here to present tonight...
Slick Rick, the Ruler! And MC Ricky D!!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,""
You know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out
To bow before his divine majesty
Oh your majesty...
Hmm
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hmm
*Kisses his hand loudly*
Enough!
Come your highness.. they await you..

Well, it was one of those days -- not much to do
I was chillin downtown, with my old school crew
I went into a store -- to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona -- what?
Mona Lisa (what?) *singing* Mona Lisa, so men made you..
Youknowhat I'm sayin? So I said, ""Excuse me, dear
My gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money
I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissors
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yay wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:
R - ravishing, I - impress
C -- courageous or careless
K -- for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and why? -- Why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm..
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playing with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playing with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of our friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leaving and driving along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song
If you see me walking down the street
And I start to cry each time we meet
Walk on by, walk on by, foolish pride
That's all that I have left, so, let me hide
The pain and the hurt that you gave me
When you said goodbye
You walked on by",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-mona-lisa-lyrics

Want a palace with the shit beige and light blue please

Case dismissed, but your honor, D.A. kindly prevented it

Treat Her Like a Prostitute,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989,"Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it

Excuse me (what?) Can I have your attention? (mhm-hmm)
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (mhm-hmm)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you, as Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same

Treat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Telling all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid, ""It's not your child""
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him

Treat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

Now your wife, you buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you ""The bitch don't deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Came home from work early Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out, bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself ""She might still be loyal""
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party, at work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say ""Where the hell are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat

Treat 'em like a prostitute (mhm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my last example

Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles and you call her Rover
Next thing you know the ho starts to ill
She says ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours - who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky
Treat 'em like a prostitute
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well
Treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-treat-her-like-a-prostitute-lyrics
Teenage Love,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989,"A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

Hey sport, here's a thought from the old school crew
A serious situation we all go through
It deals with your feelings, so hear what I say
It's like a day where nothing seems to go your way
Bust this, two people, they really like each other
He says there's no one else and she claims there is no other
The feelings are same, and you receive a notion
To reveal your inner thoughts and deeply hid emotions

A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

Precious times, hoping they won't end
Tell your mother 'bout your lover, also your best friend
Ya mighty proud while you're holding her hand
Boys, yo that's my woman, and girls, yeah that's my man
This person brings a certain warmth to ya heart
And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines y'all turn into a blur
For the feelings were the same, now here's the score
You love 'em too much, and they don't love you anymore
Due to your attitude, a number or because you're not being true
Or maybe they're just plain sick of seeing you
Word, now it might seem strange
You better take hints quick, and make the right change

A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
A teenage love, a teenage love
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

See just when you swore, the ball was rolling
They're gone, and part of your heart's been stolen
Get back on your feet, with a hop and a skip
But no, you'd rather go with this dead relationship
Hanging around, and buying him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawking
When conversation comes, you do all the talking
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind your back they're saying, yeah he's all on my...
They're getting sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happening, and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught
It'll spread around town faster than ya thought
And break up time, and you receive the words
Yo, this is from the heart, and I know the part hurts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal with it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go
""Don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again""

""Do you know where ya goin' to
Do like the things that life is showin' you
And are you going to
Do you know?""
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't hurt me again
Don't, don't, don't hurt me again

The Ruler’s Back,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989,"""Halt, who goes yonder?""
""It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham""
""Well, speak up man, what is it?""
""News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned!""
Scratches: Stop Lyin'!
Gather 'round party goers as if your still livin'
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
It's a mere party booster that will set things clear
It's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back
Now in these times, well, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause it's really a small thing
But they're bitin' what I'm writin'
God it's great being the king
Some sound alright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't get conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones' tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back
Scratches: Hit it!
Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin' y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his crummy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back
Scratches: Stop Lyin'!",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-the-rulers-back-lyrics
"Teacher, Teacher",The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989,"Well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
Known to the whole world for what? my style of rhyme
But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
Although they know they won't never get it right
Because they have no class and they have no shame
They'll bite another brother to boost their own name
Get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
But they don't understand that the master will be
The creator of the style (Ricky D)
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so easy like there was nothing to it
But they don't understand that the master will be
The creator of the style (Ricky D)

When I walk into a party coke snorters laugh
As the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
And it seems that they aspiring my new style of rappin'
And brothers all around me out of vanity, they;re snapping
The girls say, ""Wow, Rick you're so unique
Please tell us how you organize the words you speak""
'
But my will says chill and I go upon my way
Cause class will be taught some other day - so say

Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
But they don't understand that the ruler will be
The creator of the style (Ricky D)
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so easy like there was nothing to it
But they don't understand the ruler will be
The creator of the style (Ricky D)

Well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
And out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
He tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
A shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
Yup, a bunch of small timers that be at all my shows
Surrounded the ruler with machetes too
They said um, ""If you don't teach us how to rap you're through""
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
He said, ""Slick Rick you okay?""
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
So I smacked one in the face and told him, ""I won't retire
And many years from now I'll just be getting higher""
For I am the master, said and done
My name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say

(Ricky D)
(Ricky D)

Now when I was a lad my style was bad
So I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
So I quote and I wrote 'till I was up to par
Some rhymes were  and some rhymes were 
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
Answering the call of teacher, teacher
Tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
The creator of the style, MC Ricky D
Now my only task is to warn all biters
Slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
Don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
For when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
So chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
If you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
So if you wanna rule and no pride's in the way
Pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say, ""Hey hey""

Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks kinda easy like there was nothing to it
But they don't understand that the ruler will be

The Moment I Feared,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1989,"Well I'm sittin on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stiff
So I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
And I'm hangin out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my truck jewelry
Cause I'mma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
Bout to hurt you real fuckin bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid? Take the shits off man!
The fuck is up?""

I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of furious fists caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
In one of his cars, I think this one's a Riviera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, 
""I need Veronica Place that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a band-aid kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?
What you doin to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin
I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""

Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yep, he had poor Sarah's underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
But now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

This was the moment I feared...
""Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)
Spread your cheeks""
This was the moment I feared...
""UHH, AOWWHWHWAA! STOP STOP! AHAOWWHAHAOOHO""",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-the-moment-i-feared-lyrics
Lick the Balls,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1988.0,"Excuse me, I'm trying to earn a mere buck or two
A solemn rapper come in -- 
and who the fuck are you?
Around this part of town with diamonds and your girl in fur
""I'm trying to enter in this rap contest you're having sir""
You're kinda late ""Flat tire"" Well that do occur
Well alright, pay me now, and you'll be after her
""I hope I don't mess up, or run out of breath, or even break""
Don't worry hun you're hitting 'em harder than a fucking brick
""But what do you think Van?"" Please, no one can serve us
""Wish me luck dear, I'm scared and I'm nervous""
So who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls?
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

Now every time I write dope raps they come kicking it
Now you know the title of this, so start licking it
Lips kicking it, hey bitch, there is a brick in it
So when you think you're prepared, I keep sticking it
Now here they come with a spike to fight, take it light
Now who the one you're trying to be like with all your might
And anyone that attempted to remove me out the race
Best give me space before I fly in their fucking face
Now raise that vocal, play that role around your local hoods
Don't worry about a thing cause Ricky Rick is bringing home the goods
Who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls?
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

Now everything that come out your mouth, sound like it's out of spite
I'm back on a mission and this time I'm gonna anchor right
That's right, ads help
, he's improving it
""Thank gosh Rick! We love the way you're moving it""
Who's hitting rough in eighty-eight I bet your momma knows
Back slap you all down like y'all were dominoes
Stun em all, come on y'all, give me a taste of life
Act trife, I'll let my dog go fuck ya wife
So be my friend and don't pretend you will not be forgiven
You're cleaning house up to the master, that's how we both are living
So who will stands, who falls, who crowds the halls?
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!

Go Vance Wright! Go Rick! Look at the style we bring
How come you cannot write a rap that will erase the king
The girls you worship are some tramps and want to see me slam
Shit on mother fuckers and I tell them who the fuck I am
My name is Rick, but now you know who's ruling it
Pump the world and the DJ put the fuel in it
Come ride the dick and if you wanna know what is the word
Who write the baddest raps you and your boys have ever heard
I eat you up and give your girl a bowl of Puppy Chow
You understand alright? Hello! I'm trying to tell you now
Who stands, who falls, who crowds the halls?
This one the DJ calls... lick the balls!",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-lick-the-balls-lyrics
A Love That’s True (Part 1),Behind Bars,1994,"So you get my point son, you just don't trust no bitch
You know what I'm sayin? (Okay, daddy, I understand your )
Cause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?
(Okay, I get your point) Anyway, listen to this, check it out

1994, as the world gets trifer
I'm wondering, fuck I need a woman in my life for?
Ya know, cause it's like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the Fever, ""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That bitch wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you tryna dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, home girl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead outta order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that? ""My ex"" I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo..

Then I met Syb, sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like 'em
""What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd.. please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!
You know, imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it 'less I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud 'til a mothafucka fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance
'til I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dispatch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo

Though happy I was free, the need for love was still in me
Got to the point like the need for it was killing me
Then I met shorty here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the bum bitch carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling, carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarassment to the Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts"" Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour
So when I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-a-love-thats-true-part-1-lyrics
Sittin’ in My Car,Behind Bars,1994.0,"Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend it's like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend? Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off until I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
House, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said ""It's over, you waste of time bitch""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me tenderly
Snuck out later, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't (no you ain't), now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho

Another brother out for one thing, mistook him for
Steady relationship is what I'm really looking for
Sincerity, scoop the hon I done it
I said ""Being straight up, you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like mad
Still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?"" Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
When my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later""
Her girlfriend hot, let me see how they livin', Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm

Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

Got Rick sitting right here
Waiting for you my dear
Wondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho

Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""

Great gosh I needs some bad
'bout to drive me, a sane man, mad

Are you peeping this floosie
Or queens, eh excuse me
Can't believe how many times I had to eat the chick's sushi
Who she?
Look at how a brother gotta roll
All cold, kid
Anyway truth being told
Fit boy too, big
Which one you pick
Rico suave or chick one, two kid
Once I was born in this thick
Why I gotta deal with this horniness tip
This, not enough flair
This, lack lot wares
Got her holding my tears, trying to act like who cares
Reaching, if I say I see kids in the mix
Wanna cuddle, go out something, trick with the chick
Motivate through it though I know it ain't true
Why argue, tell a chick ""You're okay too""
Delilah
Though I flirt too beside her
Easy to play dumb while your IQ is higher
Why ya, you treat me like a sucker
I don't know should I keep maneuvering Tanaka?
To what, something sexual, puppy
Anything to get into this shallow chick's body
(Know what I'm saying kid)
Cause it bad, trying to drive me a sane man mad
(Say what my kid)
I needs some bad about to drive me a sane man mad
(Bring it on kid)
Good Gosh the world so bad, trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Bring me home kid)
Great Gosh need some bad, about to drive me a sane man...
I want you, munch too, comes to hun, how long do
Ma duke caught the kid masturbating once too
(no)
Passed, looked stunned, kept on like
Don't you have a steady piece to smash yet son?
What to do Mom, none touching dude's joint
Like to see me out here buying some prostitute's bum?
No?
Picking up scroin, cop pursuing
From the stripper club hairdoing
Then laughed and none but wise after
Soulmate, more than sex, a live partner
Snatch can't get, cat frantic
So, in the meantime stripper club, lap dance tip
A professional press box arouser
Some condoms so I don't mess up me trousers
Then start paying, mark swaying
Girlfriend just sit down and start playing
Here's an extra, parading the wealth
Don't want a real kid feel like I'm degrading myself
Bouncing on me funny, bouncing with my money
Or its back to playing cat and mouse games with the honey
(You know what I mean kid)
Caught a script so bad, trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Say what Slick Rick)
I need some bad 'bout to drive me, a sane man, mad

Good gosh the world so bad trying to drive me, a sane man, mad

You know a nice girl, but I didn't want a bit of her
Sayin, ""I like your slang, what's with the wife? Get rid of her""
Son, Sony talkin' Japanese
With mice like, ""Whattup Rick? You can have my cheese, kid""
I am such a heavy hitter
Even chandelier jealous off the patch eye's glitter (bling!)
Rappers walkin' 'round strappin', fearsome, HERE, SON
And remember, your rap career's done

Finally, a change from these fake rap artists
(Me and Nas bring it to you hardest)
Finally, real niggas that are Billboard charters
(Me and Nas bring it to you hardest)
Finally, we'll separate the men from the heartless
(Me and Nas bring it to you hardest)
Finally, a tag team from the top all-starters
(Me and Nas bring it to you hardest)

Run in spots, pants leg tucked in my socks
Puffin' Lamb's Bread, order drinks, Henn on the rocks
Wintertime, sport a fox, maybe a sable
Three-quarter length mink sound right for this occasion
Heard me John Blazin', see me in gangster flicks
Life is so amazin', hate to be paperless
Bill Gate in this, it must be God, I'm not a atheist
Wanted like kingpins by ATF
Your girl want my name on her chest
Me and Rick argue about whose chain is the best
Gucci boxers, my diet changed from sushi to pastas
Wear my hat like the late Sinatra's
Models pop they coochie when the spot us
Finally, rappers you could be proud of
From the Bronx to Queensbridge Houses, what?
If you feel me, then holla
Thug niggas who bail be worth a million dollars, what?

Trackmasters, Def Jam
Baby, what the deal?

Know what I mean Rick?
Know what I mean Slick, Whoa!
Yeah, wee!

Fine, grown Pine-Sol, heavenly rhyme throne
Remember when you were young in the '70 time zone?
Stages, age is 'bout seven, I say, kids
The dress code of our parents looked awfully outrageous
Not down on 'em, games and clownin'
When soul was at its highest rate like James Brown and them
Soothin' every black thing, a groovy era actin'
'Member seein' Shaft in the movie theater back then?
I feel Richard Roundtree got 'em a fly deal
Black men wearin' bell bottom and high heels
Laughed a lot, some action, mass production
Remember when cars were darn near half a block long?
Parents were so into that crap
Bunch of sweet memories to us older rap cats
Muhammad Ali knucklin' in tournament
Pimp daddy hats with buckles and ornaments
How we forget Snappy?
Five people sleepin' in one mattress and yet happy

Could even make sex seem sour
As I impress the world with my extreme power
'Cause Rick make memories sealed in almanacs
Not to mention the immense appeal the mack had
When you wake up in the mornin' (redeem from any crap)
Because I bring that lovin' feelin' back to rap

For situated as poor beneficialator
Kool-Aid 
couldn't last a hot minute in the refrigerator
School notes, slidin' and stealin', hidin 'em
Bazooka, bubble gum cartoons still inside of 'em
No way, same essence of it's earned paper
Pimps flyest dressin' muthafuckas, weren't they?
But hood lies, 
you afraid of a good wine?
I used to love the actor who portrayed one on Good Times
You need a friend to warn a soul, man, it kinda slow
One thing 'bout it bro, overflow when it's kinda so (shame)
Life, a pitiful game
'Member the robot? That was my shit on Soul Train
Got hyped too, psyched too and the feelin's right too
Chillin' on the fire 
escape on a nice night, too
No one gone try hurt di mon
Remember Right On, Blood and Jive Turkey slang?
Brothers chippin' in for alcoholic money
When you look at old flicks don't we all look funny?


Yo' mama, damn, we used to talk improper then
'Member when we used to walk bop, walk bop again?
Givin' them the rhythm that we brought
Push our hand back like we was swimmin' when we walked
Bad all about, 
Huggie Bear
, Rat all about
'Member afros, what the fuck was that all about?
Buenos noches accents too, friends too
Everybody had a lot of roaches back then, too
Profusely around us, 
Lucy Afarensis
Fleets wearing Bruce Lee Bananas
And kick shit, ball in the hand and stick with
And we use to be in some of the ""Man, you in deep shit""
Most cases, father away for good
Local Flat Foot was part-of the neighborhood
Standard, 
and the panthers (Wow)
Used to dress like Erykah Badu

I Shouldn’t Have Done It,The Ruler’s Back,1990.0,"Well, I'mma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
Born an ugly child; hey, nobody would want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang wit fellas cause they started gettin shady
I'd always be wit my girl and ya could call her my lady
I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front, see?
The problem that arose is why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out, and to make things worst
I was cursed, wit the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Ooh, I think he cheat on me, and talked to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any time that we fight
I would call and took a phone and call a girl outta spite
I shouldn't have done it

I'm feelin sad and blue

I will to make this right, so director was admirin
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin
To catch her in a lie was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin really picky
We got into it again, this time she got to bright
So me preventin a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up of the record, all this hot increase
I went up to the Parrot, with Omega, Vance, and Dane
This girl came over, she was trucked down extensive
Startin talkin to me, and she was probably quite aggresive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So meet my nigga, rude and went on wit the flow
But Joe was gettin hard, without me even knowin
We stepped up back to my van and I could it's for growin
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, I rubbed it to unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it


Now I'm seein, that there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snucked right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so unsensitive, how I'm ever gonna tell her?
Shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
How me, I guess I like the wanted secrets that I did
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell what I did
Then after that, she started actin heaven sent
I found a house spot, let's say she help out wit the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin at the parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said ""I had it for you but I guess you didn't care""
All this wouldn't happen come of me and this fear
I shouldn't have done it",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-i-shouldnt-have-done-it-lyrics
I Own America (Part I),The Art of Storytelling,1999.0,"All of you cock-pullers are frontin
Wave your arms around like your some octopus or somethin
To better ya
For any chick you want, I'm gettin her
Rob people, mad ignorant, et cetera
Who the one to entertain and fume with?
Who you no-breed humans can't be in the same room with?
Reefer sweet, wrap it up, free fix greet
Every rapper rap maggot underneath Rick's feet
Evicted -- why you tryin to find shit to lick with?
Even your kids tell you that you ain't shit to Slick Rick
Though you pretend to be glory
I'm number one, that's the end of the story
The black Clark Gable leave you numb
Every single one, frontin on your label is a bum
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say to you, nothing, other rapper cats
Chorus: repeat 2X
From New York to Cali none'll fuck with
The awkward, you think Muhammad Ali used to talk shit?
Bing!  This sure hit alone'll bury ya
And even if I got deported, I own America

He's so crazy -- 
I smash rippin up the place
Give the mack a taste -- I wipe my ass with a rapper face
Cars come to a dead stop
Rain find ways not to drop on my headtop
Tycoon rush at the richest
Even my complexion is a must-have to bitches
Even without, car money to budget
I would have the most elegant apartment in the projects
Knahmean?  Bitches are in awe * at the lingo		* (pronounced OAR)
Know that Rick'll put an end to all rapper income
An old-timer, lock up all vagina fills
France nor Italy can fuck with my designer skills
Saltin inferior, faultin to where we are
Tryin to find fault in superior
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats

You lack the taste hook I'm stickin em with
While degenrate like yourself make our race look ignorant (mm)
And your girlfriend wanna kiss and deploy
Bout in the groin gets none of this tenderloin
Feet planted on deep black firmament
Bow -- in the presence of who lead rap permanent
Like a lion rap rips a chunk of kids
You stunk, cause mortals ain't shit to conquer
Somebody said new pharoahes have appeared
How when everything I wore ten years ago you wear now?
I coulda murder heard a word out quick Rick stomp it kid
Hung to it, you complete bum to Rick
Source Awards, yeah Rick every seminar
Even make Sadaam Hussein tell me where the weapon are (mm-hmm)

Who Rotten ’Em,The Art of Storytelling,1999.0,"One of the greatest rapper, walk - I'm sayin'
In the field makin' my brick without hayin'
Mad busy kid, 
nah whip cut here
""You, Boy, drop your bundle bring your butt in.""
A soldier, what I do to that hood?
""Are you that slave everybody tellin' me rap good?
Calm down, not goin' ta murder ya
Clean yourself, Pharoah said he wanna have a word with ya""
My mom, pop, look concerned
After takin' a shower, dress and returned
The soldier, kinda on the dark end
Brought me and the motherfucking palace was barking
In the midst, a poet, dryin'
Pharoah and his girl being entertained by him
Motherfucker got some nerve
Said ""Bring slave forward, let me observe""
He asked me my name and start badger me
""Ricky, what?"", 'Ricky, your majesty'
And bowed because I had to
""Kick a rap that shit better sound fat too.""
Who rotten 'em
Plaits swing, but have you forgotten 'em
Biggest big shouts since King Tut and 'em (who rotten 'em)
Kids ville, motherfucker couldn't sit still
All bitches is open off Rick's grill (who rotten 'em)
Definetly exort, any stalkin'
Hawk gawkin' at silk fabrics when I'm walkin(who rotten 'em)
Fondle with right, yet, spec get delighted
All a that jungle shit, whites rap
""He's fat"" queen said to the pharoah excited and
Did seem obvious the rap delighted him
Then start banging on the plate (Yes your honour?)
""Send this other rapper to the lions"" (Please, no!)
Pleaing with merit, if you kill him for my sake
My raps will lose spirit
'Please let him live, I prefer that'
""OK, well, send him where this slave used to work at""
Do or die jammin' me into
Even was allowed to move the family in too
Any beat better rap good on
Even gave me mad nice outfits to put on
Knowing that my rap stlye bumped many
And expecting some important company
The king visits where I was put to write
""Slave, you're behind, better rap real good tonight""
In other words, lay your mack down
Cause these cats not the one to sound wack round
So that night, when they summers be them clapping
Took a deep breath and then began rapping
Who rotten 'em
Tryin' a find out what excite, what I write
What ignite with
Lion never once tried to bite Rick
Excusely, assumed to meek, refuse to greet
A smoother geek, just move ya feet
Shocked all dippin' and stoppin'
Even slave owner wanted me to whip a man, fucker
Shakin' any prison, kickin' back, sick of crap
And sista breakin' when a nigga rap
Well it was obvious the raps unpluggin'
Dignitaries spat wine out they mouth, buggin'
This they never heard that type a tactic
Gold sandles all over their fat steps
One dignitary overwhelmed me said
""I'll give you half the eastern border if you sell him""
Back at the rest spot to nap a bit
Mom! Pop! They delighted with the rap i did
""Son"", my mom said sweepin' up
""That lunatic'll kill you if you don't keep it up""
What's wrong with you, ""Son, I'm not scornin' you
Leave your best for a rainy day, I'm warnin' you""
Ripped my ego apart
So I set upon a mission to change the king heart
'Sire, whippin don't pay off
A lot more done you give a nigga one day off'
He took my advice, steady elegance
Sir noticed that my input was accurate intelligence
That type meant ta stripe, kids
Even after he died, I still write raps like this
Who rotten 'em
All teacher and scholar try proceed me, believe me
I am all culture that you need be
And superior juice to abuse, I choose
Use words racist slave owner used to
Sandwich known crook, redbone hook too
Got his own land, which you're known look to
Not only ass wipes, swept side kick
Shocker and them niggas even try to dress like Rick",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-who-rotten-em-lyrics

(But you must Rick) Ah, shit
Hoes ass kiss cause I'm like Jason, vision
Releasin' me a basket case from prison - Pissed
Blood feenin', the villain like 'Wassup ya'll'
Deep down schemin' how to kill 'em
Misleadin' a bit, although proceedin' a hit
I made 'em feel I'd never jeopardise my freedom for shit
Played the empty headed part
Though the moment they dreaded start, neat
Back of the head and took the credit card
Seen properly decease
Made it look like an everyday robbery to police
And I's out
Police believed a thief pop for sureity, a jerky
Alert the rest to beef up security
And not to get flashy, although another blast occurred
Another brother deservin' to get massacred
Pleasure in poppin' that flea
Should a heard mister tough guy coppin' mad pleas
Not insane, nor am I biased
Though feels good to watch a motherfucker die before
My fly ass
Ain't nuttin' to blast, fuck it
Then I put some crack vials in the ass pocket and was off
Police said a thug awaited, since I didn't leave no evidence
A drug related incident
I still clock the mil' figures, cock back triggers
Reason why your girlfriends dig us - cause I kill niggas
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy
You are my shining star, my guiding light, my thug fantasy
Well I had it up to here, that's why a brother buckin' trife
And gettin' way with murder, this the motherfucking life
At a jam, nine figure on shelf
While your army a nigga snickering among self - thiefs
Who wanna clock the bread off the next
That's why Im gonna blow their fucking head off
Maybe the victor get stuck up
Giving these clowns opportunity to bulk up
They knowin' that the kid crew showers, eye cowers
And leaves for 'bout a good two hours
While they're like 'we coulda caught Rick what, for allsort'
That's what the assholes thought
Tough guy mumblin', I thunderin'
Why I had a motherfucking A-K ya wondering
And raise it higher, start giving them the fire
As they scream like high pitch women like Mariah
Blood on the wall like, other brothers ball like they hit
Seein' shots split a motherfuckers skull like lettuce
Run a nigga best bet is for another duck in gage
I'm in a motherfucking rage
Mask 'bout face, Now figure dash
Smash 'bout 10 ta 15 nigga ass out
More enemy dug, deceased, caught
Had not, gave one fuck what police thought (what?)
But first I best provide all brainiacs
With evidence of a suicidal maniac

2 Way Street,The Art of Storytelling,1999.0,"Well, I shot some deer, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere
Due to rap's wider ratio, satellites to Nato
Hillbilly drawers flew on the stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately, wife piece back in New York
And I'm starvin'
Being human and open with
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scopin' Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bent it
Though I'm not gonna lie, I was extremely tempted
(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sister
Next thing, in the dressin' room, ""Pardon me, mister""
Yes, I said cautiously, ""Crazy, but possibly you could sign
Your name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me""
Try to resist, now girlfriend startin' it
The pen won't write, ""You can press down hard on it""
Now, my hand browsin' her South end
Spun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when
(Rring!) Loosen the grip my hell had
My girl, she was talkin' so nice I felt bad
Being untrue, no tellin' what it might do to her
""I love you"", forced to say, ""I love you back, too"" to her
Any thought of gettin' pussy was doomed too
""You got a wife?"", anniversary comin' up soon, too
Got off the phone, cock just got mute
""Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're not cute"" (Uh-huh)
I'm wrong for mistreatin' her, the wantin' to skeetin' her
""I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya""
What an angel overcomin' his wrongness
The moral I am tryin' to get across in this song is

If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with
And wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Who keeps no secret, like who they creep with
Realize early, it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)
If goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with

A big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office
And fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went
'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment
Poundin' was inevitable

The way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I
""You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye""
""Well, I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya
Means a lot to me, comin' from a woman of your stature""
I mean, who could resist the Don head?
Start caressin' Rick private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull
Girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats to set the emperor
Put one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya
Fantastic, though I start to act drastic
When I see my weddin' band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down, she felt that I tried to diss
I'm like, ""I can't do this as much as I'd like to, miss""

That's my word, I should cheat on your ass

And man, I did search for an ulterior motive
'Cause all your look is sound hype
I wanna see if you're worthwhile, settlin' down type
God knows there's bigger
So, observe to see if you're gonna sweat the next nigga
Oh, help me make green light furriers
You know in life you can't race around with no worthless
So, continue the sequel
You weighed in the scale and we lived as free people
Then disagreein' erupt too
I don't feel my standards are bein' lived up to
So, erection conquers, I ran out, went and had sex in Yonkers
God knows that's flakin', jerkin' her
And not the replacement grade is lookin for

I thought you said forever, 'til deceased (lay hey hey)
I swore you were dishonest, do you believe? (lay hey hey)
I'll search this world forever, are you real? (lay hey hey)

Low is my time of honor
Friend material and not that type of barner
So, myself out of chump
Would the problems with havin' worth that type of jump?
Commitment, Rick act cruddy
And regardless, move made and back studyin'
Still screamin', thrown and elegance
Grown, don't play around, grown intelligence
Fix what bother, and another
If speed's not made, once again, who gonna suffer?
Stubborn fools game, the mule came
Over here wit a girl from the old school name
Though hit and all though back's about wit memories
And that's about it, 'cause


An uneasiness kept here
Even after we made this big giant step here
Womanhood, somewhere in the basement
Slowin' down again, so I'm lookin' her replacement
Music, poundin' a slow jam
Wit a girl knowin' and down wit the program
Although the honey aim style king
Would of took groomin' and tamin' the wild thing
Loud, uneasiness brought out
Still tried to shove my tongue down the bushy broad mouth
Speedin', chasin' after vacant
Tried to string along but I didn't have the patience
Learned from cussin' and confusion
Breakin' commandments wasn't a solution

The one who expose cornball rappers with the quickness

Wouldn't give a fuck what part of the country you come from

I wake up every mornin' to my Lucky Charms cereal
Times get drastic, yeah, I'm a classic

So, be careful 'cause my rap will make you eat your words, son

Bite, rewrite, you're still garbage to Patch Eye

Haven't you heard? I'm loose, shook the Feds like The Juice
Snoop Dogg is 121st proof
Fool, you's a deuce-deuce of some Genuine Draft
I'm genuine, like vintage wine and all about cash
Cash, cash, so indeed I got the weed
And keep the lighter for the hash
Has it ever been a time when you didn't have a dime
And the only way to get it was to go and do a crime?

Many underclothes hangin' on the hoes
Since (Snoop, Slick Rick) crushed anyone opposed
Lot of ladies - pop Cristal, toast to all those
Like (Kid Capri) helpin' to Unify both coasts

I'm shreddin' ya temper, none 'head of the emperor
Washed up gang member? Better remember
I wipe my feet upon a rapper like a doormat
I hit 'em where they sit around actin hardcore at
Thank God for the guardians, in light of this
Rappers always beg for me to show them who The Mighty is
Gats gonna limp, snaps on a kid
That always wanna start rap, boy, they're not gonna win
And wanna dash at lethal or evil
Could a King bring style and class to black people?
Stick a whole log in and he buggin'
'Cause I represent self, with my man Snoop Dogg and 'em
I drop a pile of semen on 'em
Even in a Yugo, I could take they woman from 'em
I make the hardest chew they kewl to this

I'm 26, still in the mix
My hair gettin' longer, my game gettin' stronger
A nigga been on one, I thank God

And it's odd, for a G to get a job
So, I'd rather steal and rob and mob with my squad

Used to read The Source
Now all he read is the Holy Qu'ran
Time brings change and change brings time

I give it to y'all, like you really gotta have it
Dogg Pound Gangstaz, boy, this shit is gettin' tragic
But I'mma make me a grip and dip quick
And fuck with my nigga Kid Capri on this G shit
Dial tail and bail with my nigga Slick Ricky

Sorry, Michael, it's Rick the Ruler, I have to go

Lights, camera, action, you're on
Get 'em Ricky D, what's wrong?
The crowd's gone
So help me out Kit cause this thief has to be caught
Radio the chief of police, get a report
Chief of police said ""Welp
I'm sorry Ricky D cause I really can't help""
Ahh drats I think I'll take a long walk
Kit put your scan on all these rappers in New York
""But Michael's callin' me Rick, I have to go
If I get a word you'll definitely be the first to know""
Well all that night I felt really uptight
Hello?, 
""Rick, it's Vance Wright
Throw on your clothes, I found 'em, they're down town""
Word?, 
""Someone's havin' a concert and they're using your crown""
What?, you sure its mine?
""Yo Rick, I know the shape of it, come on""
You know your scratches? ""Yeah, plus I got tape of it""
Get over my house quick, ride your motorcycle

Here go my rap Kit
Analyze a hit, so Kit what's the scoop?

Well my tummy was growling while I was chilling in my seat
We stopped by McDonald's so I get something to eat
Skipped the line and the crowd started to break
""Hey yo, let me get a Big Mac and a strawberry shake""
Someone snatched me by my neck I thought I must be dead
Injected me with something, threw a bag over my head
I felt real weak, word, I couldn't even stand
I fell, next thing I was being thrust inside a van
Unconscious, who could be this shady?
When I awoke I was in a room with this lady
""So you're the boss, Rick Rick with all the clout?""
Uh-huh know why'm I tied up and what's this all about?
And this she left the room this was my one chance for hope
I used my watch lighter to burn away the rope
Then I's free, I's free, an alarm was alerted
I made a flying leap through the window and it hurted
Someone threw a knife, who could be this trife
So I ran and I ran cause I was petro' for my life
Stranded and raw I saw a phone not far
I radioed in to my supadelic car
Yo, what's with the concert, am I still in it to win it?
""Yes I'm in Manhattan and I'll be there in a minute
And oh, by the way, I re-listened to your hit, hey Rick""
What's the scoop? ""Oh man, this one is it!""

Tight tight security - MAN, they was the softest
Came in with some cannons and bumrushed the office
Grabbed up the one who liked to front and pretend
No, I don't know who it is, some brother looking like a hen
""Let me go, let me go, please,"" you must be dusted
Hand cuffed this brother cause the thief could not be trusted
Grabbed up my money and my crown that's how I dissed 'em
I went on the mic, and DJ, man, I'm on the system
He warmed up the techniques to show he ain't soft
The crowd was up and this is how it started off

(Who, who, who is the top choice of them all?)

Yo Vance, cut, thanks a lot, who wanna die?
We up top, somewhat, forget me not
The class that I have won't last
Soon as I blast, from out the past, dash fast, and here at last
Vance Wright, no man can bring you this
And Ricky Rick, clean shot, cause I'm the king of this",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-kit-whats-the-scoop-lyrics
Let’s Get Crazy,The Great Adventures of Slick Rick,1988.0,"(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!

Well it's me (​Rick D)​, and it's time to mingle
So wake up world and bus' out my new single
I take dead bodies and I boost them up live
So straighten up and be alert because the ruler's arrived
No (​​not uncle Sam)​​ but I can still recruit
As (hip-hop commander)​​ of the people's troop
So troop be troopers and follow commands
Cause (​​no one can rule like the ruler Rick can)​​
Though some like it hot and some may like the shock
So let's get together what I mean is rock
No vanity, insanity (strictly clout)​​
Now put your hands together and scream and shout
(Go Slick Rick!)​​ and then go berserk
But (keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt)
And don't be boring please not lazy
My jam's packed so let's get crazy
(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy!

The original, that's the title I've earned
Anybody disagreeing been burnt' and learnt'
Told a thief straighten up as I humble hell
And I (​​bring a little rhythm)​​ wherever I dwell
Cuz' the door's wide open and I'm taking the chance
As I dip through Europe and I'm going to (France)
Now I always may try and play like full of fun
But in this type of rap I number one
Not number (​​two)​​ on a wild-style blizzard
And if I was in the OZ I'd be (Slick Rick the wizzard)​​
Or some young man named MC Ricky D
And no fool can say they created me
So wild child, let's go berserk
But keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
And don't freeload cuz' I'm not lazy
My jam's packed so let's get crazy
(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get, get, get, get, get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy! (x4)
​​​(Scratches)​​​​​​​ Oh my God!
Excuse me, Doug E. Fresh (​​Yes)
(​​​​​​​Scratches)​​​​​​​ get a lil' stupid... Let's get crazy! (x2)

Well we're in the last stage, you know the final chapter
(Oh Ricky don't go)​​ But you know that I have to
So tell me daily news and all the magazines
(Ricky D's in control)​​ Of what? {​​​​​​​Hip-hop scene}​​​​​​​
Uptown downtown the man's rated supreme
If Martin Luther were here he'd say (​​Hey Rick I had a dream)​​
And if I'm at a jam it must be pumping
People dwell us light cuz' it's them I'm stomping
So y'all be adventurous (​​Shake and twist)
I insist that this will bring more than just bliss
So posse's and crews' (exercise your best)​​
It's time to get (Stupid)​​, what I mean is (​​Fresh)​​
Hey wild child let's go berserk
But keep it at a limit so no one gets hurt
And don't be a crumb and try to phase me
My jam's stacked so let's get crazy

It’s a Boy,The Ruler’s Back,1991.0,"It's me at last, the Rickster, Def Jam's where I be
And most agree it’s kinda amazing folks are born from where we pee at
Though I definitely fiend it, baby no way, chills, clever mean it being
Got to be careful (…be told), commercial ever seen it?
Want a few hot ropes, some ask am I cheatin’, do I? Nope
Not a dope, love the mother, also loves me too I hope
So I dig her a lot and although shorty honey break a nigga
How you figure, bein’ a big rap money makin’ nigga
Cute as a button, he tell ’bout the time we picked for cotton
So it ain’t forgotten, hope I don’t spoil the nigga rotten
Also, don’t discriminate white, he’ll be quite bright, if taught him right
If not he like ask heavenly father, help me raise my shorty right
So when I come home with the coil, I say “yo shorty run to royal”
Seein’ as I’m loyal and livin’ on soil, it’s best when you have someone to spoil
So any toy, he wants he gets, yo kids ain’t worth it midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it’s a boy
Pictured friends, milk and cookies, when you’re done with the boy’s game
Toy plane, Ricky Jr. being bundle of joy’s name
And furthermore teach birds and bees
So won’t be a nerd and burst herds of, second and thirds of
And “Dada” better be the first words of
Just kiddin’, son’ll be  a one man girl, spend a lot on what I be wearin’
Best of care, best that money can buy is what he’ll be wearin’
With these weathers around, protect him, they’ll say in a cage I kept him
Though wage you kindergarten probably be another major step and
Lo and behold a star holdin’, ‘cause yo be loadin’ trips and sowin’
Ya knowin’, throwin’ a fancy home for him to grow in
“He’s kinda pleasin’ to raise""… so baby say. No thank you… ease in
Sneezin’, now what do I do when he cry for no reason?
Though any toy, he want he get, yo kids it ain’t worth it, midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it’s a boy, yo
Baby mom, under wing, though if dress up, could string
Line of cuties, though cling, don’t wanna mess up a good thing
You know how it is when guys that pay girls seem to hog us
Fiend and dog us, scheme for more guts
Goin' into labor date, 18 of August
It’s that time tellin’ friends, congratulate’s yellin’
Gonna be six weeks premature, but thanks to God, he’s doin’ well
And givin’ credit where it is due, while rap’s achievin’ let it
As for bills forget it, ’cause the way I rap, don’t even sweat it
My own when me and my hon son, don’t fuss, agree
Though son, I still kinda wish I coulda been there when he was born at 3:01
Bygone be gone, there’s nowhere wrong and all
Your son’s about and since I didn’t and this being the first
You know I had to write a rap about the incident
And the rose is for the squeeze, I would’ve sent a few no women with the kin in it
Wish us luck world as we enter a new beginning
And like I said, any toy, I’m tryin’ to tell ya that midst the toys
That they destroy, annoy, though me and his moms in middle of fits of joy and it’s a boy",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-its-a-boy-lyrics
Frozen,The Art of Storytelling,1999.0,"How can I forget you?

Rick the Ruler, Raekwon, hehe the Chef, check one, two

Touch more, taste a glass of oil, flash yours Rick
Money we saw, left 'em dead on the door, dick
Rocks look chunky on the index
Straight up, Lee vets and like old Adidas sweats
We the illest vets

Apologies, even a non-dog holler ""He's honor""
Please, appreciate shit I Clark Wallabee's
Brothas wit they fists like oaks wood
Provokes doom, and you're also about to go broke soon

Mad current merchants, we nursed it, bad guerillas
Feed us like guaranteed they gon' kill us
Fleein', ninety in a night suit, G-in' white dudes
Hit the locks first, we made a right troop

I'm lushin' Russian women, via satellite I'm watchin'
I dare a nigga say he wanna battle me, I'll crush him
Even blind girls rush next to Hammera and scream out
""Oh my gosh, get the camera""

Yo, we frozen, lay on, about now we a day on
Ill niggas yellin' ""Throw Rick and Rae on""
Hydro, how did I blow, how did I flow?
Did I glow? Let them niggas know

(Yo) Rap wars commence and they kids cause offense
I don't have to say a word and your bitch' drawers are drenched
Didn't say I was gonna murder the fella
But The Ruler got some shit the could stop a herd of gorillas

Stressed wit Hollywood hoes, actin' up
Backin' up, what? This yours, what?
Crawlin' in the cut, we Lee Major
Gems on wit Timbs, brims on drawn to lay you up
Layin' in the 'dezvous, what?

Next pull up CEO wit bank books full up
Even though he's overwhelmed, this nigga Rolls Royce pull up
One of the baddest come, noddin' to a Spanish song
Slung, orange Woolridge park and a Savannah pump

Severe teaspoons, scary money on the moon
Lampin' wit a big goon, keep shit tight like a kid's room
Big Bird in the driveway, pull it out, Friday
I'm liver that way, I ride only the fly way
Olive-green thinkin', ship sinkin'
Deep-dish thinkin', big fish tank, wrist full of Franklins
This is mock-neck, shark-skin money
'88, summer, read the dunn, dummeries rock dungarees

Punctures his lung, son says ""I don't want this""
Even this so-so beat I make monstrous
Lady cops stake to watch pair hoods
""Freeze, you're under arrest, you look mad good""
Hot and don't fret retard who won't let
The new sheriff's in town, what part you don't get?
Rick and Rae are now restorin' the passion

Dumb one becomin glad the great one walks among
Whisperin, couple I scuffle eye
You little feedback niggas don't want any trouble

Lick a throw now, how til death I kick a bone out
Why pursue for folk object?
My record will be barkin all through your broke project
?? Yes my dog art, best to park her, kark her ??
You don't want death to walk her
Not sayin that -- ain't nuttin could do me

Hell yeah, ram the one sell fare elsewhere
Put you and your family on welfare

'Scuse me, if I'm bein overly rude to public
The favorite -- make you fall in love, make whoever with
Clever kid, make you do the best steps you ever did
The trick is, managin to kick it

All Alone (No One to Be With),Behind Bars,1994,"All alone, no one to be with (in the background throughout the song)
As a youth, each Sunday, Dawn went to Church and
Paid her respects and not to mention was a virgin
Kid pushed up, Dawn lettin' him
Since he made her laugh and all the other girls was sweatin' him
Then things started to move without pause
And a couple o'months later kid's pushin' for the drawers
Under pressure while exchangin' glances
Dawn finally gives in to the sexual advances
Although it was a mad high cost for her
Cuz' after the thrill was gone, so was the lust for her
Eventually he left her for another
Now feeling alone and betrayed by her lover
She cried--for no longer knew which way she headed
Once dreamed of actually wearing white at her wedding
And really being pure, now she thought she'd die without
Still she finds strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Without love...
Without love...
Without love...
Verse two of Dawn's life--the second segment
What could be worse than to now find out you're pregnant?
Poor Dawn couldn't sleep--laid awake
Not ready for a child and plus her mother's gonna break
And she doesn't know how she's gonna bring up the subject
Consequences of being used as an object
In church though time's runnin' thin
She decides to have the child because she doesn't want to sin
Props to the girl although ahead hard times;
It was Hell finishin' school and working part-time
Yet Dawn did it though her youth went to waste
Little help from the government, she got her own place
HARD for an independent woman and a kid
And as soon as she could get off the assistance, she did
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continue with her life without love...
While Dawn worked two jobs tryin' to meet ends
Her son was busy cuttin' school and hangin' with his friends
So when she got words she tried to slap out the taste in his mouth
And explain how important education is
Under stress, she takes two Bufferin
Son now tired of seein' his poor mother sufferin'
Starts to sell drugs though the cops did a raid
Guess who's in the mix, and being legal age
Could do time, please call her employer
To inform her that her son is gonna' need a lawyer
Never no good news, just more strife
Dawn barely havin' enough time to live her own life
Hears the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him
Here's the judge's sentence, beggin' and pleadin'
Now spends nine hours on the bus to go and see him
Without no man who she once thought she'd die without
Still she finds the strength to continue with her life without
Love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Life without love...
Continues life without love...",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-all-alone-no-one-to-be-with-lyrics

Mistakes of a Woman in Love With Other Men,The Ruler’s Back,1991,"Call me the freaker, I bump it in ya speaker
Week on my birthday, met this girl named Tameka
Astonishing creature, made the rest look tired
Desired, that was the beauty I admired
Out by the 41 Brook, no joke
Can I have a toke, finally, she smiled and smoked
Gave the girl my number, though I still felt rejected
Hectic, called me more than I expected
Months passed by, even lived together and all
Dream come true, 
until suddenly a call
Oh brother, why do I discover
My honey, Tameka, yeah callin me another
Broke-hearted again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
""How low can go
""/""Hold it now"" (4X)

Well, tried to block it out my mind, here it was again:
Other men, confronted lady and she said he was a friend
Didn't believe her, she packed, brave her
Strange behavior, so silly, we forgave her
Late again Thursday, alone Rick sat
Left flat, look in the mirror and I wonder where she at
Gave the girl my heart and soul, it's after 10
And again couldn't manage if she slept wit other men
Out wearing my jewelry so you know she looked truck
Struck 3 o'clock, here she come, fishy like a fuck
Come and let me smell you, I wanted to say to hell you
Hi honey, sorry I'm late, but let me tell you
It's a fast chat, need the phone, slow rollin
Could you go to the store and get some soda cuz they open
Again it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
""How low can go""/""Hold it now"" (8X)

Strike one, strike two, no exaggeration
Try to play it off like it was my imagination
Beer mix wit alcohol, help me to forgive
Deal wit weak minded and I have no will to live
I deserve honesty, and treated like a pet
Now she's being nice, but no I still can't forget
Put the cards on the table, don't get loud, cut the bull out
If you slept wit another man, I'm strong enough to pull out
She confess and then she left, smooth
Wanted to kill myself because to live ain't the move
Broke-hearted again, it offend and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes of a woman in love with other men
Once again it offend, and I pretend
Mistakes... in love with other men

Ain't no way on Earth to faze Rick, the man plays with wit

Niggas think they bashin me, his majesty
Are garbage and never were no match for me and actually
Many a girl catch this fever
And I don't need anyone else rap with either
If this is based on skill, kill anybody will
Affiliate Rick grill to Hicksville
Same ruler move with cowardness out of this
Never out power this, devour this and now it is
Time for one to leave upon impeach
Help teach all men how to live amongst each (KnowI'msayin?)

Named Rick, no rapper alive could mess with him
Makes records all audience roar to
Grandmothers show, skill on the dance floor too
Freakin awesome, of course I'm married
High school broads keep your drawers on

Guaranteed to make you break fool at the work place
Diligent, shout out Mr. Militant
Allow me to do my thing, it's all brilliant

Is it a custom - to what? 
To provoke out a hostile apostle
And make him smack the coke out your nostril
BAP, 
the butter cat at gutter rappin
 and I'm all man
Whatever gotta happen gotta happen
Boy don't make me put my grown man shoe in you
And I'm sorry father, for any wrongdoing doin you
Cause dogs barkin and the girl sigh
Here to present myself as the sparkle of the world's eye
Picture I - where Spice Girls chick arrived
England, January 14th, six-five
While you scream out ""Grannyville
You old ass rapper!"" You got it, but can he still
Sever, in other words, rap more clever
Like no other younger rapper walkin could ever?
Apparently I done this, on this
Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign

The fact is, mack caught cable in an actress
And really is the black Clark Gable of the rap biz
Racists reactin, hastin for action
The motherfucker got exquisite taste for a black man
What you never know? All clothes come off a ho
Ever see me with my jewels and toast from off of Mo'?
*psssh* Past where handsome measures
Like the whole entire Rat Pack, AND some precious
And chartable, such a big spark I pull
Nuns even say, ""That motherfucker's remarkable!""
And aliens who came to earth gathering
""Great gosh the man has soul, we must have him""
Like a catastrophe, there isn't none after me
Liz will throw away her walker and run after me
Snatch crowns -- done this, on this
Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign

Up Hastings, crew downfaced and lose
Either one way or the other, foundation choose
Although the prune I kick, I didn't come to wound a sick child
Hit a lost world, actin like a lunatic *blblblblbl*
Who provoke til a heard of smoke
Forced good men to pull out and start to murder folk
Tired of the basement placed in
Take responsibility for your action as a race then
Instead of put cheer in our bone, paperhood promote
Negativity, and fear in our own neighborhood
Since royalty breed to be (uh-huh)
And I puts small seed where small seed need to be
Like an angel tend to fly as, mention I as
I didn't make the laws, but they make sense to my ass
While waiting for the world end, won this
Stunned his behind - out the way of who reign

Runaway,The Ruler’s Back,1991,"Well, I waited long time sweatin it
Gettin jerked but yea I'm gettin it
Early mornin, stiff's the dawnin' of
Cuz a brother give the warnin' of
A new we do we and
Paranoid to near silly and
I said meet me in the lobby skip
So one could cut down on the chubby tip
Alright, he flighty scared
To be in fear to show a mighty that
La Di Da Di wanted Gotti and
Although depending on the body and
Who I know was gonna runaway, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God's King


Check it out, even candle light I figure and
Better handle it my nigga and
I think the best thing is to block her out
Cuz she doesn't give a fuck about
Someone change the choony and
You would of cared to wish the u-nion
She's not a phony, turn the Sony off
You better overcome the lonely of
Although a brother leaden bad
Thus don't know where I'm headin at
You see, cause even though we fought a bit
I find that just the very thought of it
When I know she's gonna runaway, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know she's gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God's King
And I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe that this is happenin


Well, I should say fine phoney gone
Although you say that I'm the only one
But, behind my back's thinkin of
Her father not the one I'm thinkin of
I'm distrustful what one done to end
Down wit this burden here I'm wonderin
I know I should say fine fair to ya
And think about all the girls ahead of ya
Though hard for me to just forget her and
Try to follow to the letter end
Although the terrible things we riff about
Her father wise that I can't live without
When I know you're gonna runaway, how am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, so hallelujah, praise God King
When I know you're gonna runaway, am I to live to serve the next day
When I know you gonna be wit him, can't believe this is happenin
I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him
Seems I know you're gonna runaway, I know you're gonna be wit him
Can't believe this is happenin",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-runaway-lyrics
Venus,The Ruler’s Back,1991,"All the lonely guys.. {*echoes*}
Just gettin' off my job, ‘round Wall Street, with the ties on
Finest girl, a brother think he ever set eyes on
Nice day, weather sunny, as he made a run for honey
With a warm personality, well it’s on the money
I’d have tounged her right there, seemed kinda fun up there
Wonderin’ there, as he tellin' me he could get the underwear
Meanwhile, still jockin' her, like a real sucka
Sister which was so fine, she could have AIDS, I’ll still knock her
Heart beatin' for her since a brother didn’t figure meetin'
As I ask her if she’s single, “yeah, caught my nigga cheatin'”
“Nice to meet ya”. Leaves… she had dope combined features
Watched her walk away and observin' the fine creature
Next day again, went in uninvite, super angry with us
Ran into so much that her and her friends had start to hang with us
They pair and move, though fine, they both swine
“Can I take you out to movies wine, dine, the whole nine?”
She condones, good riddance, nigga slid this on her
Didn’t want to get to bone her, though I knew I didn’t own her
And I could’ve made a move, a little will power ‘cause although
That she told me she liked him as a friend and that was all
And since hang with us, she already told her, cool he freaked her
The week on my birthday bought me a pair of Gucci sneakers
“Did she like me?”, racin’ the thought. “Was it a sign?” Guess it weren’t immoral
When she saw me, definitely this is kinda special
Since for this dish, none abate, but everybody wanna play
“How long is money gonna wait?” 
So I asked a honey on a date
And she accepts, though thought it wasn’t much  a plan
Windows on the world, even had the nerve to touch her hand
Though not lookin' at. Bashful? No sir
Suppose I was so shy and then the hon' pulls closer
Thought “clever hint”, so what she straight, never been so excited
And convinced, kiss, in heaven ever since
Holdin' her hand too, chillin', future plan to build
Couldn’t believe my dream fulfilled
 and then that girl began to ill by sayin'
Lady if you will
Say you’re the one that sent for me to thrill
Someone that I can hold close in my arms
With all the charms of you
All the charms of you
Of a lady, this world is just for ladies
A heart screams out to ladies
A world of love’s for you",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-venus-lyrics
Women Lose Weight,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Chorus)
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
(Verse 1)
The name of this entertainement is 'Women lose weight'
Our first years of mariage everything was just great
But after two kids And a weight gain factor
The fact is Now she's completely unattractive
Look fat chicks I don't mean to sound rude
I tell her nice hit the gym And don't eat so much food
But no Your shallow
You need to run the course of unconditionnal love and so forth
But how if desire's is not there That's just delayment
Divorce is, child support, alimony payments
My happiness i doubt discouraged
So hurry for an easier way out of this marriage
Meanwhile my secretary June well groomed
When you gonna leave your wife I tell her soon mommy soon, i assume
Or my destiny is blue Interestingly The only thing left for me to do is to kill her
(Chorus)
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I'm gonna have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
(Verse 2)
My plans against or shenanigans Kinda ran thin
Knowin' nothing about poisoning And i can't swim
Bad intentions pumping Might as well become numb
Cut her lungs or the obvious robbery gone wrong
But the catch is do i have the nerve to dispatch this
Who can i get to help me murder this fat chick
I guess i'll have to play a dude robbin
On wednesday The day she usually goes food shopping
Anyway long story short hit the side of her Chrysler
And sent her clean over the divider
""You bastard"" she said
As the wreck went tumblin down the hill I thought ""she has to be dead""
Later on get a call (from a) Lieutenant O'Rourke
(had me) leapin like a frog We need you at the morgue
So i selfishly persue
""boohoo"" there was nothing else for me to do i had to kill her
(Chorus)
What a surpriser, Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
C'mon ya'll know i had to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces
Send that ass right to the morgue miss Kill her
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I had to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
(Verse 3)
So you mean to tell me officer you don't have no clue who did this hit and run
No sir we don't have no clues right now
This is terrible what am i gonna tell the kids?
Pull yourself together sir
I'm so broken up inside i just can't believe this
I understand, I understand
Catch the person who did this
We're gonna try sir Please
Screamin ""who done took my heart"" acting shakin up a lot
At the funeral though everyone was lookin at me odd like i did it
Like i was the reason my mates slain murmuring
""I heard he was displeased with her weight gain""
While my secretary sort of a sexy blonde can't cook
All she does is order from restaurants
All of the sex you want I doubt could adress
Clothes not washed proper and house look a mess and
Talkin to detectives that was waitin outside
How i took a long lunch break day the wife died
I darn near turned pale
And because of betrayal they indicted me, and gave me an impossible bail
Good fortune to anyone admiring the rawtent
Moral of the story is
Desire is important
So watch your weight It'll keep you mate smitten it's a given
Though looking back i realised i didn't have to kill her
(Chorus)
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I didn't have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
I killed her
What a surpriser Open your eyes, A Woman advisor
I didn't have to kill her
Of course there's laws which enforces divorces
Send that ass right to the morgue miss
Well there you have it Keep thin trim Keep your mariage healthy Do you know what i mean?

I Own America (Part II),The Art of Storytelling,1999.0,"All of you cock pullers are frontin'
Wave your arms around like you're some octopus or somethin'
To better you, for any chick you want, I'm gettin' her
Rob people, mad ignorant, et cetera
Who the one to entertain and fume with?
Who you know breed humans can't be in the same room with?
Reefer sweet, wrap it up, free fix greet
Every rapper rap maggot underneath Rick's feet
Evicted, why you tryin' to find shit to lick with?
Even your kids tell you that 
you ain't shit to Slick Rick
Though you pretend to be glory
I'm number one, that's the end of the story
The black Clark Gable
 leave you numb
Every single one frontin' on your label is a bum
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say to you nothing other rapper cats

From New York to Cali none'll fuck with the awkward
You think Muhammad Ali used to talk shit
Bing, this sure hit alone'll bury ya
And even I got deported, I own America

He's so crazy, I smash rippin' up the place
Give the mack a taste, I wipe my ass with a rapper face
Cars come to a dead stop
Rain find ways not to drop on my head top
Tycoon rush at the richest
Even my complexion is a must have to bitches
Even without car money to budget
I would have the most elegant apartment in the Projects
Know what I mean?
Bitches are in awe at the lingo
Know that Rick'll put an end to all rapper income
An old-timer, lock up all vagina fields
France nor Italy can fuck with my designer skills
Saltin' inferior, faultin' to where we are
Tryin to find fault in superior
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats

You lack the taste hook I'm stickin' 'em with
While degenerate like yourself make our race look ignorant
And your girlfriend wanna kiss and deploy
'Bout in the groin gets none of this tenderloin
Feet planted on deep black firmament
Bow in the presence of who lead rap permanent
Like a lion rap rips a chunk of kids
You stunk cause mortals ain't shit to conquer
Somebody said new pharaohs have appeared
How when everything I wore ten years ago, you wear now
I coulda murder heard a word out quick Rick stomp it kid
Hung to it, you complete bum to Rick
Source Awards, yeah, Rick every seminar
Even make Saddam Hussein tell me where the weapon are
Let me slow it down, that's enough of that
This I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats

Cuz It’s Wrong,Behind Bars,1994.0,"Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...

Sang my songs, stuck in my tongue, girl strung
Sweating among them was a hun
'Got a man, but we not getting along'
Lick the balls, I know some girls that lick it, not around dick it
Rick it's amazing how you rap, word up, you sound wicked
Do I dig her, silly pressure, picture drig up, do a drig up
If you only knew how good, Rick, you look into mirror
Buck perfect, to her car, said when I walk, not ever
Tell her 'call me later on, just to talk, or whatever'
Stirring it up, learn the digits, to be safe, burn it up
And here's another Slick Rick one, and her man turned it up
Now on the strap, very soon, she be all hot wanna rap
Some cat over there, but Rick, ain't nothing gonna happen
Comes over, stuck my tongue in her mouth, she gave me a hickey
Shocked me, the way she jock, truck me not, me Ricky not
Known to faking, and you probably kidding rock, just something
Thought your ho strung, nah, didn't knock on tongue
Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...

Another honey, real sneaky, lines thrown on the freak
Sends money, works away, but he be home on the weekend
Wanna say your best, I'm charging the rest though
Sends the guest off, now massaging the breast off
While I'm getting info out of her, girlfriend side of her
Doing this already, I be in that and out of here
Ask her friend, what poet best? Rap my vote
Don't know, girlfriend asking like down to cut throat
You seem too hard for the rest of the them, met all into them
Get to a friend, sometime today, so we can get all into
So then friend said don't take all day, whore, I mean
Drops her number on the floor, make sure the dog seen it
Alone asked, can you help me rap, maybe, winking
Think me, you go far, oh yeah, that's it, baby, drink it
Don't effecting on your pop, kid rock just one
Though your ho strung, nah, didn't knock on tongue
Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...

A good look strike ya ho, you attack mic, it's on
I wanna ask is that really real? Bitch, act like you know
Give me a line for your joint, make to every story define me
Getting noisy, everybody leave, but you close the door behind me
Left your man dressing room, you try to diss me cuz you rule in school
I said word, so won't you kiss me, you fool
Shoulder shook, she popped why not, another fan of word, on the lord
Well anyway like an autograph and a cut
Made my move to triple excitement, stop Rick, you're flipping
As I grind against her pussy and I gently lick her nipple
Less than a minute, warmth is missing, look at the high in her dressing
Lights off, pull panties to the hide and caressing
Mass roll the plan of life, wonder keep her in, passed off
Bolt than she sang, more deeper than my pants off
Don't effect and now you pop, kid and rock, just stop
No strung, no I didn't knock on tongue
Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...
Cuz it's wrong...

Moses,The Ruler’s Back,1991.0,"As you see Ruler show's, is 
Inquiring
 noses
Goin into a story about a kid named Moses
Once a prophet was to be born, so for anything else furve it
Fear of orders, every first born, some murdered
One got away, a girl wit profit for a river
Gently put him in a basket, went floatin down a river
Then hands up by a fair up relative, or honey peep it
Couldn't be the severed, once determined to keep
Don't say a word, she told this slim, who was a real witch
Snitch, it'll definetly be the last day you breathin
Wild kids slaughter, cuz they was fronted them
Soldiers tellin the kid that they murdered every one of them
Thanks said Pharoah, guys little friend tips
Sister showin her baby sayin her River God sent it
To a brother who arose and said, ""whoa sis""
Cure as I suppose this, the upward knows about Moses


As time passes, prove he wasn't the type to beg or borrow
Group to conquer land like ain't no tomorrow
Made the Sun King jealous cuz he couldn't do a moldin
Pops I'm not to happy the way you jackin this Moses
Some dish rap behavior ruins every piece of bash
Though I complain, where's the several action build
You piece of trash, tree or switch
Mo' you buildin, and find your cream's hero
Built it, anything else, you need pharoah
Come to star this, this my crown
One say ""How can he"" but since not takin any chance
He threw the hooker off the balcony
But word sold out to King, he bank cold cuts blessed
Stripped him of his honors and dumped him in the desert
But I'm return for the people, this chest about saw
King said ""You want war? Make brick without straw""
That's a son not being king, and shorty knows good roses
When I be, suppose this the upward knows about Moses


The new King said, S be the threats, filled wit stuffing
Oh boy, what do I do? Now pray to prophet
Then a vision said chill and prophecy fill
Scorm build, hells of fire, or there first born killed
It's gettin scary for the king, he made the sufferin go by Mario
You win, take these peasants and get the fluck outta my area
More villains, still in heat, didn't want my 2 to fill him
Wasn't chillin, then I flat sent the troop to go and kill him
So more, prophecy, when a crossing said run him
Did some ol' abracadabra and water fell upon him
The soldiers that is, since Moses was suave
Then Mo' and the mounds havin a convo wit the father
Came back in the tens, seen panty hoes dropin
Partner suave, folks wasn't into what po-pop was poppin
So the Earth shouldn't kill those, bible takes clothes
Talked about a time when not the worst spit foes and met Moses",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-moses-lyrics

Screw, cuz you don't what the Rico do
Giggle to and as you can see a butt wiggle to

Nuttin but a jammy on my side and
So cling on brother's arm I'm thin
I'm wonderin, should I begin to kick ya mind in ching

If ya forgot who was the man I'll stand and live kid
You will be bouncin up and down cuz I'm a grand individual
Shit you will fist and cheer to dear, disappear
To where you no where near to

Clever trap a hook and screamin on yours forever and
Town to town wit the B-Boys sounds
That has the Ruler Rick announce, which ammounts to bounce to
Classin, still hum the lassin, smash jewelry have like
Kids from the Bassin, cuz bodies lay about
Respect you better pay about
Obey about, cuz Ricky isin't sweatin what you say about
Hum on the clause, silent jay younger boy

So cling those on them cling, I'm wonderin
Should I begin to kick ya mind to ching, cuz I'm King

Kid shot, cuz we on the boy's hot
Cuz the part don't start that's killin noise fart cuz
Strive kid, go for the nicest
One for the trife shit, run for ya lifest
As I scrape hoes, graspin to shape up
Clothes drape, tell me why you blastin the tape up
And up high to, as you boyfriend tried to be
Hoes fly to Vance Wright, tearin inside of me

Let nobody clone ya, and get what I own ya

Say fellas how you organize the word's today
On my will says ""chill"" and I do it by my way

Remember one night when the world was dead quiet
And outta nowhere some boys start a riot
Take off my clothes, I had to throw blows

But just since its (Slick Rick) being an old school legend
I decide to make a jam the kids will slam on
(DING DONG) How you doing, Gigi? Is your man home?
In the living room I see the brother sitting
Say what up yo?

Yo we cooked 'em in Atlanta

You think we didn't?
Bitch coming on, beat box stunning, son

Yo, where'd you get that outfit?

Might not shoot you in front of group two
Run a boot, did I mention I'm also quite cute too?

Chick got to storm
While other rapper cat' kettle go hot to warm
We Turn It ON

Yo, as we turn the heat, yo, yo, yo

I bogart through, and then be screaming no hard screw
Hey go-cart crew, your checking out ""The Show Part 2""
A fellow I know, ""Is this supposed to sell?""
I hope, so well, I spoke, and this is what I tell white folk
I don't discriminate, don't lack the stimulant crack has
Battle story man, and I'll eliminate your wack ass
Backwards tactics, Show for act it
Me and Doug Fresh took over this rap shit
Flushes, so as usual tossers
Better give us our props as you're new school wusses
Good times, patch rhyming brought back
And all you other rappers that's trying to talk crap
I'm not the devil, but your worst nightmare
Sick of rebels, and none of you motherfuckers can
Reach the cat's level
Four motherfuckers got to storm
Other rapper cat' kettle go hot to warm
We Turn It ON, nigga",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-we-turn-it-on-lyrics
Tonto,The Ruler’s Back,1991,"One day fishing heard Indian drums
Saw a brother, listen too, wife kissin' too
Then on another mission to
The city with the sistas, though was a far distance
There’s Lone Ranger outta area that needed my assistance
To deliver cash, last man got robbed, pimped
He never returned, I said “ok” and put the money in the Fendi
Then bumped into this girl
Looked like that that girl on “Mork & Mindy” and
“How” I said to the white trim, jockin' me the Indian
Comin' in all this heat, the kind for hopin' a chance for ropin' in
“How’d you like to put your Indian teenie in my openin'?”
Said that would be because the nigga wasn’t new to this
True to this, double barrel slide out the uterus
Calm, started singin' sad popular songs
Took the money and the hon', screamin' at the top of her lungs
Now on a hunt, “You carry leaf?” I was about to smoke a blunt
No, not without frontal, screw girl pronto, mean Tonto

Was extremely pissed, still picturin' screwin' this
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
I don’t know why the fuck I’m doin' this
Nuisance, brother’s/horse tracks, whose to choose?
Saddle loose, both thirsty cuttin' a cactus for the juice and
All of a sudden, these women like model ho’s in Paris
Ganged to rape me the Indian, I was so embarrassed
Don’t pull a kid a minute, to give in within a minute
‘Til I seen a shack yonder, a couple livin’ in it
Shook my hand, friendly manner, though she pack her up and ran her
Couldn’t stand her, fondle her feathers like she wanted some banana
Led me to the back of the house, the hands that started track
Used it as my marks and then I nearly had a heart attack
Brush it off, deal wit the floss, way past disgusted
Said “what’s the matter granny? Is your blind ass dusted”
Back in the hunt, now what do you want, poor granny offered me a blunt
No not without frontal, screw girl pronto, mean Tonto, grandma

Found they’re small timers after all, wasn’t her intent to brawl
Pulled out my 45, “How, y'all… up against the wall”
“Where’s the hooker and the money?”, here she came, sweatin' mine
Then the bitch is pointin' a pistol at my fine behind
Now she a smart ass, should of figured when getting' off the hottie
So the horse busted in, started lettin' off the shottie
Killed the men, slapped the girl, ‘cause he figured I’m stuck trapped in
“Come on Rick, a horse cappin’?” Yeah, that’s what the fuck happened
Grieve the folks, bleedin', sides red, I’m pleased and
Indeed, now I’ll let the Apache kill the bitch, no I need her
Playin' the role, better yet, “well is your pole up?”
Signals from the wife sayin' “what the hell is the holdup?”
Although he scares the honey, hit the switch dares to run it
Caught and scalped the daffy hooker, said “bitch where’s the money?”
Gave it up… hunt done, she wants a blunt and so it’s frontal
That’s not what I want, so drop drawers pronto mean Tonto",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-tonto-lyrics

""Ricky, you the nigga don't forget it"" (6X)
""Ok, ok, ok, ok"" (6X)

Well as you know, thousand tear off their blouse
Be aroused, have a spouse, try 'member who house
And big hitter in leavin' a fitter in literin'
Get rid of considerin', rocks glitterin'
Walkin' over like a hawk and stalkin', king souls
Every one walkin', one of a batch, want a hatch for a poppin'
When a catch for a play in batch four another match for
As can vision upon pull, now it's all full to a rich or for the poor
Without no more delays, sissy world flips, 
Because of our way, niggas yell, hiphiphoorayin'
Is it? So as the next kiss it, and a sex miss it
Remain the exquisite, as I shower the hits
Best split or let me see you overpower me twit, 'cause I ship


Blocks and blocks stare in the jocks
Hip hop the fox, knock niggas out box
Wit the fly green socks
 and the limelight flappin
It's nothin dap in this, so champion of rappin is
Brother girl fiend brought a jugga
Though I overlook her, being dream but a hooker
Yo who got things sowed, one guessed it
Blessed with, he can't mess wit
Bulletproof vest sweat like doors like Coron'
Hello psycho home, pass that microphone
Hearin', whole world cheerin'
Nun scaring, eight million dollar ring wearing
So let it be as the world said it
Cold sweat it, Ricky you the nigga don't forget it
As I shower the hits, he best split
Or let me see you overpower me twit, 'cause I ship


Yo, why in the world is rap white wind
Then sent for a mental, who dance or I enter
Present to the fans, who want a picnic bent
To get sent to spray praises on new found intellect
Though I'm wettable, who fedeble, unedible
Mic said mad incredible
Never heard of us, when your words are dust
Send you move like murderers, not murderers proud to say
Girls go 'wow' and 'ow' to now show ya how to bow to
Scoop-a, in the train goopa, don't bloop a
What, Rick you playin supa dupa
How Slick ya? You best get the picture
The one eyed kid, remain victor
As I shower the hits, he best split
Or let me see you overpower me twit, 'cause I ship",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-ship-lyrics

Well I'm riding round the Benz truck with fake friends

What the hell Crumb, don't you have a consciense?
Ill treat the vogue, get the gold, chuck a heat in gear
Don't understand it til the blood sucker beat it
I see my doc, I'm said 'yo, doc, how's the health there'
Don't worry bout these pretzel muthas acting like your welfare
Word to parasites, tell me, hasn't it ever occured of
Stand on your own two, please, I never heard of
By the window in the bathroom, that one did it
Got a dress like a brother, then both of them will quit it
Potential is intelligent, and it's me you wanna rob

For five bucks, cool, window while she drives, barely missed him
Pissed him, dissed him, turn up the system
You ought of treat us to dinner, I'm hungry, said her daughter
She tried to crawl behind home, and heat bread & water
A rich girl, don't like, I said he's always the best
Yea, whatever, no question, project destined
Yo, what the hell is with you people, are you all incoherent?
Fifty years old, and still be living with your parent?
Not a break to breathe, yell on the phone
Take all I own, everything, and leave me the hell alone

Please drive me across the whole entire world
My new man sure can't budget and he ain't too bright in math
Like it's my fault he couldn't manage money like that
Survive with your man, I didn't say grind the strife
And even worse when they never heard of 9 to 5
And you can't be gentle, or they get all sentimental
I don't work for white people, well work for Oriental
Her baby's mother, her friend, that's why plenty get killed
I'm in Peru, kids hurt, and I need twenty mil
On man written traps, deaf, dumb, blind too
I lost my wallet, son, sorry Gramps, lost mine too
Lonely on the step, but still I have a cold heart

Marvel at the cars that the one I got outta
Dismantle all vandal who cannot hold a candle near

Who makes every  walkin' dance
Plus the clothes you saw me gorgeous bout
Would make a homosexual ask where I bought that outfit
No question, I answered all gangsters and
Paralyzed moves like professional dancers and
So go West, we a family skunk of rap hits
To snap out of you that divide and conquer crap
Pass the bubbly - to the good guy starter
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

And even the sun be like, ""That kid over there brilliant""
Knew this isn't new deficit, all figure ripped
When I'm in the club, mad noise, at who the nigga is
Entertainment, alter, baldhead slaughter
And Moet sparks curse, hi my name Rick Walter and
About to offer lead to drop another muffin
Even dead folks nowadays hoppin' out a coffin
What's one to do, goin' to do, blunted too
Son to who conduct the whole world if wanted to
Who assault viking, when he touch like lightning and
Everybody know me, walk in sparkling

And don't doubt it if you see me in some cornball outfit
Pass the champagne to good guy start
Rap style keep you in a good high bark, I sparkle

Against stars bright, so stay over my housetop

A trailer full of women lovin' the rhythm, I'm givin'
And skin -- for what Rick -- for artiller within 'em

You know that the legendary reign this game kid
Massage and awaken who start to it
Old folk drop teeth breakin' so hard to it
That's Rick, so any drunk like a glad kid
Do that little dance where you spin round a tad bit
All battlin' done, just one hunch and I'll
Fight punch you all, all you fans dysfunctional

Top Cat,The Ruler’s Back,1991,"Eatin’ a bit and nap, human being make way spittin’
As I’m skippin’ through an alley in New York, a stray kitten
Dog chase couple of blocks, shucks, tough being a fox
He in a tux, some good samaritan’ll stuff me in a box
“I’ll find you a home.” Why do you cry? Where went? Just like whine
‘Cause ASPCA to me a kitten ain’t like right and
Constable comes, wonder why? I heard say “unhand the fly kid”
Because the bitch looked like she needed a home more than I did
Word, bit her off another like, not a committee, hit her off
Not to mention, sweatin’ the kitty litter off
Had to do this, ain’t no regular, see the loot is
With this rich white lady sayin’ “Ain’t he the cutest?”
Clerk said all deals are straight, so when the car wheels away
Although the ho’ better know I want four meals a day
The rest is firm bein’ a trap as the hon adopt cat
“Better be a good lil’ kitty”, hooker don’t pop crap
‘Cause I’m Top Cat

Let me hug him for the millionth, and again, great the zillionth
Huggin’ me so much, she almost suffocate the brilliant
Sad eyes, plus she had a bad pad, nice
Said I have to do my share of work, the hooker had mad mice
Was like a fleet of them niggas, though it was kind of fun to be ill treatin’ them, clean the mess, must’ve thought I was gonna eat ‘em
Cat food, this ain’t none to me, see a rat, you come run
Or like “hunt” to me, “you wanna get this shit from in front of me?”
Word, Thanksgiving too? Please, now shout for somethin""
“Can a nigga get some air”, she wouldn’t let me out for nothin’
I guess I could be called a brat and now a jolly ball of fat
So let me rub my head against her, so she think she all of that
And every day of the week, sweatin’, works like a sinner, stay off
“Would you lay off? I’m watchin’ Prince of Bel-Air, you’re in the way of”
Mouse race across the room, should’ve seen me stop trap
You’re still a hooker snap, didn’t I tell you don’t pop crap?
‘Cause I’m Top Cat

Male come and the sex triggers, and his penis stiffer, bigger
Said “boy she sure be sleepin’ with a lot of different niggas”
Ten positions as he coaches, do it in the mood above reproaches
I wish the bitch would clean her house, you wouldn’t have so many roaches
But still he buggin’ and he comin’, and the naughty with the hottie
Fall asleep, burglar come, “up shorty get the shottie!”
Tried meowin’, nothin’ stirred him
The ho’s meal blurred him
Peed on a bitch, got up and chased me ’til she heard him
“What was that?” Got her gun, she had a dozen, mad lot
And for a over horny lady, definitely wasn’t a bad shot
Police came and all of that and now a hero hops, run to her
So I snuggle up under her, ’cause I’ve kind of grown fond of her
When a mouse run across, should’ve seen me stop trap
I thought the ho was gonna snap, she better not pop crap

I’m Captive,Behind Bars,1994,"""Bust a move"" 6x

What's good? Chit-chatter, back to work last week
Had to spit, muthafucka, I ain't doing jack shit
Go ahead, squeeze the trigger, cuz I don't see how you figure
Two lashes, ok, it can be a good nigga
I'm the last man cooking, I was in heat suppose
Crawl back to the house, the wife cooking pig toes
Life's rough, that's the tore up, peace, but that ain't enough
Had to see master plow her, and my honey pie stuffed
Then trifle like bring her body, had Rick's wife
And she's nice and the kids be like 'daddy, that's life'
Take it like a man, money, try, keep rocking
Then one day, clock the balls, honey drive by and said
I'll do anything for you, kept drinking up
Hero of my wife, tell ya man stop sticking her
Master's coming, I'm not saying you're not attractive
Whip snap, if a nigga run high active, I'm captive...
*samples scratched up*

One day he was dogging her back, got me mad too
Dish it like you like this, she said, Rick I tried to
Aiding to the problem, master wife, what you wanna do?
Connie was naked and parading in front of me
She said, that's the slut, Rick, and I'm over her
I said chill out sweetheart, because I like life alot
She said, I have sources who will burn you on the cross
You get across, see, don't make me have to force you
Man, I had a decision, so I winked and to the granny
And she said, well you can start by eating my fatty
Change of plans, she said, no Rick, stay here
Quality's a whole, is never seen in a man
Can some change for me, said I attract because I'm handsome
Forgive me Rick, and step back to the mansion
That night be home, I'm finding blood all on my feet
Said shorty got shot for eating an extra piece of meat
I'm not even gonna start, no dad, I didn't budge
Next day master acting feminine like a fuck
Thinking I'm mean benching, no, hands is on the hips
Kept winking at Clinton, tried to kiss me on the lips
And here came master wife, saying I'm attractive
The whip snapped, if a nigga weren't high active, I'm captive...
*samples scratched up*

Master departs, can have some? You never bought some
Quoting from the bible, telling me to have a heart
So I shove aside the price, cuz I asked her, I'm above it
Until we asleep, she's like master, I love it
The slut, he suppose to be gay, I figure not
But, here came master trynna squeeze a nigga butt
Look you getting too bold, well ain't you the meanest?
Bang bang, my liver son, he shot him in the penis
I said, chill, son, he chilled at his little Teddy
He said, don't go home, I done killed mom already
You know the half, now my life is full of laughter
Fell in love with granny, lived happily ever after
Due to the fact, the hooker found me attractive
The whip snapped, til the hooker weren't high active, she's captive...

At the curb, looking close to regal
My hoes, pure dimes, now approach the vehicle
What you call this?  Quite appalled with
""Must've been a slow night,"" 20 grand, that's all bitch?
Took the cash and just about to dally
When Peaches, beat down, ran from out an alley
Delayed, more beef now placed upon a player

Hold my pink fur derby, I'll be right back

A make a quarter roll of hoes bubble like Cristal
3 grand a night each, three ways I fish out
Hoes better have my scratch

Out comes a dime, red dress, bottom shimmeyed out
Askin if I'm the great one, like there's any doubt
She want to split her gorilla pimp Jimmy house
I spit iceberg cold, and plenty pound

This bright hot shorty with ponytail approaching
So I move in on her hot drawers
I'm like hey baby, my name's Sweet Daddy, what's yours?
I spun a 360, impose on
Now she in the palace alone with no clothes on
And my flagpole blazing in the trimmer
Say about 2, 3 days of this dilemma
Now got lots to do, say to the prostitute
""You love me?  Prove to Sweet Daddy how much you do""

Till I dialed her up like she was a Heidy Fleiss model
High heels, make up, then I inspect the chick
And fling her outside to suck a Wallstreet executive

Bond,The Ruler’s Back,1991.0,"Yeah, boy!
Check it out Slick, ya know what I'm sayin?
No complaining
I reached my destination and its raining
I'm in Colombia, the Bond steps off the plane and
I hear a hollar from a bro with ring around the collar
Its chief of police, grease Bond, tell me to follow
Treated me to everything, no taxin, maxin
Gives me a hotel suite for me to relax in
Seems everyone was on my silk drawers
A cloud does it have to bug me a daffy nerve
Jumpin out the closet, word up, dead nigga
Said ""Chief how do you figure tryin to arrest me, the Double for the
Murder of the nigga?""
Now in a cell, but not for long, and now I'm out,
 I hear a weeping
One asleep, other sleeping, kept creeping
Bumped into another, my appearance was alarming
(To who) some lady that thought I'm charming
Please, the way I is I don't even have to say hon
So who's a Don?
You better believe the nigga keeps girls fond
The name's Bond!
Well, I'm outside and its the chief with twenty thiefs like the brainiac
Aware because the Double 0 was bucking like a maniac
Till nobody lives, so hon, nowhere to do correct
Said ""excuse me baby, but where they hiding the hooker at?""
""Around the block, but chill at least chill till the storm has stopped""
Decided it was a helicopter, sounds like its warming up
Grabbed ya leg, shot the chief, someone said ""Stop hawking""
Shook me off at twenty-thou, the Bond got up walking
They was laughing as they left they grew thinner like Iraqi
Got the plans from the dying chief of police in her pocket
To make it even worse honey girl was definitely rattin'
Was holding her in a club that was happening in Manhattan
I'm on the plane in the day seemed nothing was a phasing
Except for the stewardess jocking the Amazing
But kept my composure, had another honey hon
Who the Don?
Better believe the nigga keep girls fond
The name's Bond!
Back at home in New York, I didn't want to get too overfly
You wanna know why I pulled out my 535i? (pimp!)
Boy I see some lookouts with some girls that's annoyed
It was a private engagement for the dealer and the boys
Double just passed the hoods with their faces painted
Walked in, say a good twenty girls fainted
Throw cousins all out but seems that everyone was shitting
And man I was so cool I even carried me a kitten (reowr!)
Trouble for the Double 0? Wouldn't swallow that
Who's the man with the Golden Gun and all of that
Turned curls of mercy, left blood on the walls of
Rescued the shorty who was all on the walls of
Whore said ""You're late!"" I don't wanna hear none of your dissing
Nabbed the cash, made a good twenty million on the mission
Good job, not to mention had the boss honey hung
So who's a Don?
Better believe the nigga keeps girls fond

You say you'll take my lady, freak, that's only because
When I look at the monster, I say, ""He can be yours""
He's a dog, you're a snake
Two cobras for ya
Left over little hotties with not under desire
So, where's the crown for the great snake conqueror?
A slap across the face to show how much of a punk you are
You wanna play? Well, I carry a tray
Let's call it self-defense if I blow you away
You (Snakes of the world today)
You (Snakes of the world today)
Oh, so now you're gonna front like you are one man
I'll beat you down, 'cause they might lie and play me like I'm a fan
Blood-suckers, I'm healin' that it's not on your side
But, honey, word's out, and your man's a duck
From freeload city, he ain't worth a damn
Tryna come out on the scene tip like that-
Yes, you, little girl
More familiar faces
Don't play brave or you'll need more than 
So, snakes unite
Respect you'll never get
You sold your innocence to a royalty check
And my words are true and they hold no mystery
It's written in the past and you cannot change history
(Snakes of the world today)
(Snakes of the world today)
So, you want me to bow
Well, I'm sorry, Your Highness
Payback is a witch for your undeserving kindness
Your claim-to-fame is now properly over
So straighten up your life or go join Jehovah
Bricks through knives, thug's a played out user
Countin' up your joints just like another loser
All you snakes, whassup
You think we're playin'
Your mic styles weak like the man L was sayin'
So, cheerio, stream or vote, it was fun while it lasted
Yo, love's not the message for you, you white bastard
Yes we're supposed to play that we carry a tray
We'll call it self-defense when we blow you away
You (Snakes of the world today)

Don’t Come My Way,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(featuring Slick Rick)

Yeah yeah
You know, Slick, why do he wanna come crib
Acting like he know how the brothers live?
We have to let 'em know
We have to let 'em know
Heeeeere we go
Behold a pair of white horses on the Death Wish course
Been watching MTV, reading articles in The Source
Lost on the other side of the river
Where death approaches the livest nigga
I wonder why this wigga
Would even come around my tilt
With grandmothers cry, uncles get high, and cats get pealed
My guys will deal with him, he got no rhythm
So let the steel hit him, we speaking jail diction
Hoe work and day oppression
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
So my neighbors won't hear the sparks as the lead gets pumped
Its a prenup agreement in the cement jungle
Kill each other over money and white boys for fun

Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no

Little family so a junky living act as
Started smoking crack to fill the void within my black ass
1999, rolling as some broke cat
These white kids asking questions
About where to buy some coke at
Kinda shock a dude, Ruler turn a sucker to
Show 'em where these cats at, maybe earn a rock or two
Retarded, not knowing the kid hardest trife
Kill 'em, asswipes, I'll have a new start in my life
Till the drug lord knock upon their debutante
Disprespected, ""Washed up rapper, what the fuck you want?""
The often asked, I could see others laugh
I got my man he wanna a buy a half a ki off your ass
Scolding 'em, sleeping and sold on 'em
Gimme the cash
Let me flash it through this peephole on 'em (Check it out)
He got hyped quick, pursued in the tight crib
Emptied on their asses, including the white kids

Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no

Yo, How'd dude go cop a brick when he ain't got the loot
Ricky D, get the heat and 'Treat 'Em Like a Prostitute""
This wigga gots no heart from his Iowa start

And a Section 8 cat, he don't want any part
I put two in there, ruin their, pursuing their souvenir
Nigga, what the fuck is that white behind DOING here?
Won't you say you wanted to slug 'em
""If your not here for the cable or the (?) ya BUGGIN""

Lights flooded the scene, there was blood and si-reens
(sirens)
The cops shot the brother, I still hear him scream
Black mans reality, white mans bad dream
Familiar scene from the Ickeys to the Brady Green
Its pissy hallways, broke elevators always (ya know)
Ain't no place for our children to play
I try to go out in the summer and be feeling the day
These broke and stupid niggas, yo they still in the way

One of the mightiest slang, and plus the night is young
I got long term money draining ideas from
Since they far, I'll find your brown sweetheart
Just being white your like golden goose around these parts
Hey retard, better hurry in, my name is Father Marion
I'll hold that American Express card your carrying
Put your nose up, don't, shut up, provoking and woke up
First where do you live, how much money your folks got?

Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no
Don't come my way
Hawks feel the day
Things don't change, oh no
Don't you come my way
Come my way
See the day, oh no

We let the rhythm go
Common Sense will 'em hit where I hit 'em
Common Sense will spin 'em check it out
I guess I did 'em where they should to be done
Ain't nothing new about the wonder rap son
Closed styles like captions yo its time for some action
Man, I get bread, niggas get me sled
When I come up off their head, it was said
For that, yo, it's like this
Common Sense'll strike this, mic this
Just like some punchlines
How niggas follow me like one time
Everybody love me like the sunshine
Combine, ain't that you never knew of
Niggas say one but I've got two loves
Check it out, now how I do love...",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-dont-come-my-way-lyrics
Two Way Street,UnKnown,1999.0,"Well I shot some deer, then I copped some beer
And did a show up in west bumblefuck somewhere
Due to rap's wider ratio, satelites-to-NATO
Hillbilly's drawers flew on stage like tomatoes
Apparently more mack than I thought
Unfortunately wifepiece back in New York
And I'm starvin - being human and open
A mad fine hillbilly woman was scopin' Rick
Thought entered how to lean and bend it
Though I'm not gonna lie I was extremely tempted
(""To what Rick?"")
To discharging a sister, next thing in the dressing room
(""Pardon me mister"")
""Yes"" I said, cautiously
(""Crazy but possibly you could sign your name on the back of these daisy duke shorts for me?"")
Tried to resist, now girlfriend's starting it
""The pen won't write"", (""You can press down hard on it"")
Now my hand browsing her south end, spun around, about to shove my tongue in her mouth when (""RING"")
Loosen the grip my (?) had; my girl she was talking so nice I felt bad
Being untrue no telling what it might do to her
""I Love you"" - Forced to say ""I Love you"" back too to her
Any thought of getting pussy was doomed, too

Got off the phone, (?)

Chorus: (repeat 2x)
If goodness is what you're filling your soul with
And want to find a woman you can chill and grow old with
Keeps no secrets, like who they creep with
Realize early it's a two way street kid
Casually seating with some thick (?) eating with my album playing at a big board meetin'
(""I love this!"") Being the coolest and the roughest
A big (?) woman pulls The Ruler in her office
I fixed the wedge in her garment unsteady; unsteady my heart went
Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment
Poundin' was inevitable, she said to me ""Rick I think your album is incredible!""

(Rick I think you're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye)
I'm glad you think it's boomin and I catch ya', it means a lot to me coming from a woman of your stature
I mean who could resist the darn hat, start caressing Rick's private, kiss me on the neck
And I can't be held accountable, down her gown I pull, girlfriend pussy look plump and poundable
She sweats (?), put one of your legs up on the desk, and let me enter ya
Fantastic girl I start to act drastic, when I see my wedding band palm the bitch left ass cheek
Deep down she felt that I tried to diss. I'm like

An angel overcoming his wrong kids, the point I'm trying to get across with this song is...",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-two-way-street-lyrics
“pie” (Feat. The Rock),UnKnown,UnKnown,"You know, The Rock's gonna tell you a little story
You ain't gonna believe it, but he's gonna tell you anyway
It's tough to be the Rock!
Oh no, no, shut your mouth! No, no, it really is
Even though The Rock is...
The Rock is the most electrifying man in all of show biz!
You see, when the Rock gets too much...
Too much of the fame and all the bright lights...
He likes to kick back and have a slice of that unadulterated delight!
Ding!
Slick Rick: Welcome to Rick's Bakery, can I help...
Wait a minute... Aren't you the famous Rock?
The Rock: Yeah, The rock, the people's champ in the house
What's happening, Slick?
Slick Rick: Hey, how're you doing, guy?
Look, you gotta take a picture with me before you leave, guy
The Rock: Whoa, whoa, The Rock doesn't want to take pictures
The Rock just wants a piece of pie
You got any of that in this bakery?
Slick Rick: Oh, I got every pie you can think of
I've of strawberry pie, blueberry pie, apple pie...
The Rock: Blueberry? What? Oh, no, no, whoa, whoa
Actually, Slick, it doesn't matter what type of pie you have
Let The Rock tell you a little story about pie...
Driving down South, though quickly aroused
When my car caught a flat near this old farm house
I hope somebody's home, takin' a chance at it
Knocked on the door, and this fine chick answered
(You're The Rock!) Can I use your phone?
(I'm shakin, sure, if you try some of this pie I'm makin')
Daisy duke shorts on, five foot stood
Said, ""sure, what the heck, I mean it did smell good.""
(So she called Rock to the kitchen, towards the vapor)
There's her grandmother, aunt, and a Chinese neighbor?
Well, The Rock is gonna tell you again
You see, it's tough to be The Rock!
Yeah, The Rock knows, that might sound crass
Oh, and by the way...
All you jabronis in the locker room...
You can all come kiss The Rock's ass!
'Cause you know after The Rock lays the smackdown
On some big, fat, ugly hermaphrodite!
The Rock needs a little distraction...
And a slice sounds just right!
The Rock said ""thanks ladies"", and more kind words
Grandmother said, ""Be polite, eat mine first.""
So I sat down, tried her's, she looked quite glad
Had a strange tasting mold, but it wasn't so bad
That's right, The Rock having pie in the country
Devoured her's, her aunt's, and still I was hungry
""That's all?"" Rock said
Bored and reading the paper
'til finally, a plate of the next door neighbors
Dogged it down fast, 'cause it really did please
I mean it tasted so good, Rock was talkin' Chinese!
 That good pie!
Slick Rick: Oh, that's the pie you was talkin about!
Oh yeah, The Rock knows the millions can smell it now!
It's tough to be The Rock!
No, no, no, no, it really is
Because you all know, The Rock is the most...
Electrifying man in all of showbiz!
You see when The Rock gets too much... Too much of the fame...
And all the bright lights
He loves to kick back and have a slice...
No, no, no, no, no, The Rock is gonna eat the whole damn pie!",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-pie-feat-the-rock-lyrics

Wave your arms around like your some octopus or somethin

For any chick you want, I'm gettin her
Rob people, mad ignorant, et cetera
Who the one to entertain and fume with?
Who you know breed humans can't be in the same room with?
Reefer sweet, wrap it up, free fix greet
Every rapper rap maggot underneath rick's feet
Evicted -- why you tryin to find shit to lick with?
Even your kids tell you that you ain't shit to slick rick
Though you pretend to be glory
I'm number one, that's the end of the story
The black clark gable leave you numb
Every single one, frontin on your label is a bum

From new york to cali none'll fuck with
The awkward, you think muhammad ali used to talk shit?
Bing! This sure hit alone'll bury ya
And even I got de-ported, I own america

Give the mack a taste -- I wipe my ass with a rapper face
Cars come to a dead stop
Rain find ways not to drop on my headtop
Tycoon rush at the richest
Even my complexion is a must-have to bitches
Even without, car money to budget
I would have the most elegant apartment in the projects
Knahmean? Bitches are in awe * at the lingo* (pronounced oar)
Know that rick'll put an end to all rapper income
An old-timer, lock up all vagina fields
France nor italy can fuck with my designer skills

You lack the taste hook I'm stickin em with
While degenrate like yourself make our race look ignorant (mm)
And your girlfriend wanna kiss and deploy
Bout in the groin gets none of this tenderloin
Feet planted on deep black firmament
Bow -- in the presence of who lead rap permanent
Like a lion rap rips a chunk of kids
You stunk, cause mortals ain't shit to conquer
Somebody said new pharoahes have appeared
How when everything I wore ten years ago you wear now?
I coulda murder heard a word out quick rick stomp it kid
Hung to it, you complete bum to rick

Halloween,UnKnown,2017.0,"You can open your eyes and see I've devoted
All this time to it
Pans labyrinth, my hands looking to fine tune this
What slumbers here is not human
I brought an atom bomb with me call me Von Neumann
I'm not a scientist, just innovative
I'm tryna climb just with the things I say displayed on the grave stone of these rappers favourites
Pick your poison you can sleep in peace and get out of the way, or lie awake assured that you could die in vein
You should select your placement
And register that thought
In fact there's a line in a verse for every person that's been talking trash
You not in my class, same study but you have not advanced, hopeless
I hope you grabbed your moment cause it's closing
Fast, they hoping slowly, but he no Aleister Crowley
Crash, comes the moonchild
I've spoken
Light faces the darkness
The devil versus my soul
He can keep it if wishes, he just has to cut my marriage to these quotes he can't control me
Holy matrimony
You can open your mind and see I've devoted
Only Every single word and sentence
They've been working, efforts show that
They could never burn my essence or deter what I work towards with records
A perfect record of 100 wins, so when he losing?
Never
They life a fairytale what happens after ever
Ever after cash to burn through the rainy weather, I'm eating better
They tryna come for beef, how dare he try to spill my cheddar?
They've been thinking cow but I'm the goat
We on a different level
I'm on an open road, applying pressure to the pedal
While They in the house on the couch, they working, no Geppetto
I've been focused on my goals, while they focused on the measure
I am never scared to crash, I got this shit in the bag, man I was cut for the clash, A different cloth is apparent within my craft
Kendrick verse on control, I am that
The embodiment of telling your competition they trash
I feel like Michael Myers, this knife might take your life in a flash and I know violence sounds obscene

This isn't Halloween",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-halloween-lyrics
No Limit,UnKnown,2018.0,"I got no limit
This expression is impressive I'm getting it how I live it
It's best to bet that they will never stand next to this, I am winning
I do this shit to brag not for attention, don't forget that
I got no limit
Could've been a child of god but found that I am bound to fall victim to this sinning
For this money I'm in prison
But the bars is what they lay behind and I forgot to mention that I
Never needed practice only passion
Dreams like Cassius a vision you can't imagine
Hands made of stone, competition bout to catch 'em
They a statue, I'm clay, this chip on my shoulder isn't in frame
But what about the caption?
They've got a picture of the moment, a moment within the action
I don't care about reactions
A picture speaks a thousand words, I'm just tryna grasp 'em
They can take the moment for granted, they open handed, they don't Deserve to be so understanding of all this magic
Obsessed with the kid, they got a fatal attraction
But keeping focused on the lane only gets you stuck in the traffic
Nick Orton, I've been dodging all the masters
Ricky pouring in that lane with the fastest whip
I'm back on my radioactive shit
They've been active on the radio but they ain't this immaculate
Imagine if you lived the life we actually live
I'm on about a wink of sleep within the year and it's the twenty sixth of march
Working for no pay, no cars, no status yet it's easy to see that I am all that and a bag of chips
I bet if you showed the best they'd get mad at it and throw a tantrum on they throne
Cause i'll make your favourite rapper play within the average role
I'm coming after the goal
Fuck it, I'm mad, I'm coming after they throat
Alexander McQueen
You can swing above the floor for ever claiming that my rap isn't inspiration
What Im sayin? McQueen was the goat
But you don't like what I wrote
Then take a lap with him
Lightning strike in a flash and its actually just my heart within a lapse again
It's pounding out my chest, I ran a lap on this, I'm after this

My stomach's in a knot
I think about the distance I've come an awful lot
And I don't really have too much to say about my spot
I'm caught up in the chase after everything I want
With no progress, I'm out of reach and out of touch with reality
I think they mad at me
My, focus is salary
Their, focus anatomy
They worried about the calories I eat
They worried about gravity, I leap
I've been jumping off the balcony
This a different side to me
I've changed for the better
I plan to take reign but the weather is brisk
I feel sick!
They telling me I'll never forget what I did
But I don't really plan to
My success isn't circumstantial
I'm moving for the plate
But this weight has been heavy like an anvil
I've been at a stand still

I don't even know if I'm okay...

It's been two years since I left
And honestly I meant no disrespect
But I obviously haven't even learned who I am
And yet take a look at what everybody expects
I'm sick! But pretend I'm in perfect health
That's the problem I guess
I focused on the wrong things
My art is a way to help me
But this isn't really healthy...
I'm just tryna vent
Cold air through my window
I've been running from my past since the intro
I'm just looking for some justice, wins low
And the losses getting loud, crescendo
I don't, even, hear the, crowd
I have been drowned in my mental
And they don't even listen in the first place
So I guess I'll just fade away

Have healed, that I could skip this class and go practice.)
“Well, I’m afraid Stu
You’re request’s denied, now please turn to page 2
In your science book ( NO! ) the airhead hollered
“Calm down, and take your hands off my shirt collar!”
This behavior did not appear wrong to this
Clown, flung me to ground then went on to his
Practice, always gets the besta
“Don’t let that big bully get to you, professor
He’s just a big fronter, not stellar, a stunter.”
I’m 10 years older than the bitch, I STILL WANT HER
She was the girl I always dreamed about tappin’
But with my geek character, never gonna happen
‘Cause you know how redbone chicks act

Put Stella in the car, then dashed to a deserted
Area, I quickly uncovered
“How ‘bout a little bit head, my beloved?
Open up your mouth and put my big peepee in it.”
“You arrogant ass, take me home this minute!”
Shocked, I almost choked on my mucus
“Listen, I’m sorry, I’m acting like a fool ‘cause
I’m tryna impress ya, but instead I disappointed ya
First time I saw ya in my classroom, I wanted ya
So in my head I thought actin’ like a mack’ll-

Left the rest of the formula on the third self
So, right before her eyes, back to my nerd self
(AAH!) the fine bitch yelled out!
Her eyes poppin’ out so far, shits almost fell out!
Explained when I make certain things, how it alters-
“You went through all of that for ME, Professor Walters?”
Said we oughta become more than friends
We tongue-kissed, and been together ever since then

Slick Rick’s “Hey Young World”,Conscious Rap Teacher Mixtape Hip Hop Saved My Life,UnKnown,"Guess who's back (3X)
Hey young world... the world is yours
Hey young world... the world is yours
Young world young world... the world is yours
Young wo-ah-huh-huh-huh-urld

This rap here... it may cause concern it's
Broad and deep... why don't you listen and learn
Love mean happiness... that once was strong
But due to society... even that's turned wrong
Times have changed... and it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten... who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right... and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid goin wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company... hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting... hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself... and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non cool... your life, don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead... and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves... hey they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hardrocks too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud... so proud of you too
And this is a message... that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true
""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party""
(repeat 3X)
Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world
""Yo peep this""

Hey Mr. Bigshot... hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a nickle... ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.... because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy... now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
Steal mom's welfare... and you'd run and buy some dust, and
Plus, a must say... bigshot you're not
Your friends are talkin and I'm hearin that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it... go get a suit for a j-awhh-ob
You see you're actin like this urge is demanding
C'mon, wake up... have some understanding
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers... rap is trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you, he
Guides you... and he watched you as you grew, plus
Past the age of... a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
So be mature... and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen... I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world... of hate hate hate
Pull yourself together... and get yourself straight
Men don't steal... hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack... your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature... and kids do your chores
Make your own money... hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, cause that's a man... that's brains no spite
Stayin out of trouble... when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight... in God's sight
Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw
And it's true
""You know, you know what, you know what, you know what?
We like to party, like to party""

And his and his and his partner...
Say what?
La-Di! Da-Di! La-Di! Da-Di! (repeat 2X)

Notorious feat. Cole,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Intro (Slick)
Why would i do that at that part, what the fuck
Verse 1 (Slick)
Im sittin half naked in the room her ass shakin
She fuckin with bum ass dudes, who claim they cash makin
But you find out they still live in mama basement
These hoes too basic now im all in her dreams
Freddy no jason
She gettin clingy im needin my space bitch
We takin of like a spaceship
Sippin im on my bombay shit shit
Keep ya mouth shut dont say shit
Lane switch, switch the flow
I thought i been told you
Your hoe my property look at her
When she goin down to deepthroat
Im grabbin the wax, takin dab
Robbin the stores for some candy like damn
I got the munchies, im feelin hungry
Poppin the shots out the roof, dummy
Takin the shots out the shot glass
Percocet 30 we pop that, yo bitch we fuck that
Balenciaga we rock that, bitch suck that
Can't touch that, hammer, she foxy, tanner
Im back, with the strap, teammate got my banner
Hop out the phantom, hot like a summer day
Pop like a landmine, were all fine, all day
Gotta dime rollin blunts on the raw trey
Got a lotta hate but the result of my game make it fuck what yall say
Verse 2 (Cole)
Uh huh, yeah i like this, turn me up in the headphones a lil bit
Uh huh, right there
Fuck the, fuck the, fuck the
Fame and stardom, i just want the fortune
I want a bad bitch with no kids im not, against abortion
Fuck the bullshit, pulled up in the porsche that horse shit
Throwin thumbs up at the whip they always sayin oh shit
Experiment gone wrong, im notorious unlike the warriors
Ima win all 6 games come in the finals
Upon arrival, we’re takin titles, blast past my idols
To go viral, suicidal im not
But these drugs just be killin me slowly
Only seein bitches faces like a new pair of oakleys
Same birthday as toby, diamonds dancin on my wrist
Watch how they dance hokey pokey, uh
I only need 3 more lines, just adidas
Shots tearin up ya stomach without the tequila
Off the pills can never find my weakness
Ever wonder how im hot, tell me ever seen venus, uh",https://genius.com/Slick-rick-notorious-feat-cole-lyrics
