Range Rover Rhythm,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Holla like whatever all we needed was a reason
All this money they been showing they got reasons through the ceiling
All we wanted was a part, all this seeing is believing
From the jump its from the heart, pardon we wit all this breathing
All this anticipation, all this keeping this shit even
All these hands in the way when all they reaching is beneath 'em
All these plans we done made, all we see is what we keeping
All you standing in the way is only leading us to be it
Bet whatever on the vision, if they get it then they on it
If they don't but they close enough to see us and adore it
Let em watch from over there, let em watch and know we here
Better dreams while we up, better watches for your stares
Call it Range Rover rhythm, and may we go and get 'em
At the will of what we on, and may we blow the engines
May it be just what we want, and may it all glitter
Just the same as what we saw cause what we saw was fucking splendid
All the scenery they threw us, easy to influence
Nothing bout us changed, so you can leave us if you knew us
Jumping out a Range had us dreaming to maneuver
And mu'fuckas tryna brand new us

Range Rover rhythm
Corner store signature
I don't do it for me
I do it for the liquor store
Said we knew what it be
Knew it what's about
Tryna 80 thou' somethin' 'fore we out

(And all we kno is) how the sweetest dream couldn't be anymore heinous
Promise if you sleeping you'll see where we all aiming
Cause dreaming is all tainted, but we was on that anyway
Should've never offered us to get a taste
Good to enough to want it on a bigger plate
Climbing thru a kitchen tryna get a plate
Either find a way or go and drill away
Living like, 400 a pair, yea my Penny's straight
Living like the ending was beginning with a get a way
Another day, another dollar, we just tryna get a day
And pull a whole decade within a day
Promise you my Penny straight
Straight enough to '95 Hardaway penetrate
And open up a lane if they don't give a lane
Lanes open bigger for that Range Rover rhythm
Tryna open up the hood and put a name on that engine
If it go misunderstood, I'll remain on my pivot
For a steering wheel draped in a vision


Hospital days, reflecting when my man laid up
On a uptown hot block he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', on the day in question I told him
I would've went wit him, thank God he ain't listen
Reminiscing over Henny and all of them pictures
We ride around now knowing we're probably different
And how it sounds now, know me as part of the feeling
I gave it life, muthafuck a honorable mention",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-range-rover-rhythm-lyrics
Suicide Doors,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"As I think of how to begin this, I already thought up the ending
And if the ending dictates the way the start of it’s written
Then I’m really rewinding what isn’t, get it?
Swear it gets harder to get it but when you got it
To get it again’s more innocent, it’s like product
Concealing the end is in a sense how lights got us
And sealing the win’s where it begins, it’s right by us
Labeled it type bias, to be one in the same
Or maybe they might buy us, to see one of us change
Or say that they might bye us, and leave us yet again
For a gain like pills on the banners of your screen
Know to handle the regime is the handle on the lead
And the hands do extend ‘til a hand is outta reach
And the reach be the limbs that’ll balance out the means
And the means to it all will get a ski mask involved
And you winning or you swimming in a flood of the maroon type
Sheets by the dozen and you covered by a boom mic
Pardon, the most humble of an autograph
The threaded needles of Desert Eagles and honors raps
The high of thinking you can find more
The balance of the script when a shooter signs off
Ballerina fits like two inside four
All for the intrigue of a suicide door
…

Saw the doors lifting up
And then they never came down
I mean they rode around the block with the doors lifted up
Like they was flying off the ground
And then they told us that they call those suicide doors
They said they call those suicide doors
The break lights was 100 dollar bill green
And we was green for a suicide door

And as we take this to a further route
The steps move like its word of mouth
The steps move like if they was stepping with us when we further out
So step two becomes to work around
It gets lighter than a fly knit, tighter than a eye slit
Brighter than the writer you was bright enough to climb with
Complimenting you while biggin’ up me
Just brings us up to speed to the steps that we aligned with
Then it all ties in, tied up to keep down
Or cover up your eyes when it flies like you Dee Brown
The complexities of rubbing arms next to me
It all adds to these bags of longevity
It’s like, I’m Wayne Shorter with a ratchet fetish
Or, I’m Mendecees with a jazz collection
In other words, I covet what they covered
Like overflowing cupboards spilling Gold Medal dreams
And running to the cupboard like you’re gold medal breed
Or bred, and fed how that Gold Medal steam
Meanings all over, you can pick the one that suits you
Depending the tie the accessory could lose you
See how we still twisting shit together?
Black ice dangle from the mirror that reflects us
Black ice tangled til the loop is tied off
All for the intrigue of a suicide door

Dreams In A Basement,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Chucky: It's quiet here
Fresh: Yeah, I like to come here
Chucky: It's lonesome, you know what's whack
When I'm down with the posse or at home and shit
And everybody be screaming and yelling and shit, it gets real lonesome
It be like crowded and noise and screaming
And suddenly it feels like I'm the only one there
Fresh: The more people there is, the lonelier it get
I have this dream
Chucky: Yeah, like what
Fresh: Nothing, sometimes I have it, that's all

Celebrating the win, celebrate what it meant
Do remember and celebrate it again
Right newly winners we celebrate where it went
And sewn different we celebrating the hem
Right you sing along you celebrating the hymn
Bet em to prove me wrong you'll be celebrating they end
Tell em its crew first, we celebrating with kin
And fuck an E for effort, don't celebrate the attempt
My attempt be, everything the rent be
Call it hand-in-hand but a hand can't be empty
So I was in the basement sparring with complacency
And my weaving got me off when it would tempt me
Sofa beds and dealing with being better than all that you listen to
And feeling like it's whatever as long as it get to you
For the nod and the doze and the open yawn
Shit is beyond what they hope, tell em no regards

Sometimes I wonder will I ever sleep the same
Cause I, I let these dreams keep me awake
Said I need more, I just need more
Cause I need more, said I need more
So I dream

For all the Grand Aves, all the Merrick and Lindens
All the Fulton streets, forever we did it
May we never forget it nor what it took to be it
And for the taking when we take it like it took repeating
They took to me and I took em home
I shouldered all of it, brave enough to look alone
Looking thru blinds tryna look for time, counting to hook a line
Tryna serve what you deserve but still cooking mine
Pint of Hennessy, tryna write a memory
Live it and forget it like tonight was like the end of me
Right in a basement loaded with ambition
Smothered by it they wanna eye it but can't listen
Sleeping with the cousin of sleep and her hands vivid
Turn for the win but most of em can't pivot
For the nod and the doze and the open yawn
Shit is beyond what they hope, tell em no regards


For the sleepers, and for the dreamers
For the awake and everything that's between em
For the awake and everything they believe in
And when believing ain't enough, I be up
I be up on the other side, where the others tried
For the other ride, or otherwise
Otherwise I'll be sleeping here wit y'all
But dreaming ain't enough so if sleeping is involved
Ill be up, on the other side, where the others tried
For the other ride, otherwise, dreaming ain't enough, so I'll be up",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-dreams-in-a-basement-lyrics
Spike Lee Was My Hero,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"I heard D's from my pillow, right?
Made me lean out my window, right?
Knew the scene from the get go, right?
But Spike Lee was my hero
Say you here by any means
Tell 'em ditto, uh
But Spike Lee was my hero

For the heroics, capes on to notice
Waited for them to show it and traced all of the motives
The motive beyond reason to pay us all in the open
Like maybe all them below us is waiting for us to throw this
If money talks in another kind of slang
They hover by it again til you changing all that you've spoken
Like ""where the speech at?"", tell em that you breathe that
And shit is asthmatic the way they hang on the feed back
Fuck em all until they know that you mean that
And they're ripping up your drivers side, digging thru your g-pack
Talking Hamsterdam and they don't believe that
And hanging out my window helped me see that
You know the scene, rubbing shoulders with the cast like I wrote the lead
Shit I just wrote where we was at and put that over these
Bad bitches want Isabel Marants
And we all tryna give them what they want so you know the speed


They said its rules to the shit
Money that should be ours, the pursuance from the get
I'm true indeed for a flip
I'm due in need of a flip, but as true to me as it is
I'm still, truly yours and truthfully for the win
I'm still, doing more for you and me off the rip
I'm built, by what I saw so usually what it is
Is everything that it was, beautifully on the strip
Standing underneath an awning and hoping to get a morning
I swear they so belonging
Of all of these wide bodies and whatever other callings
Of all of these Nola Darlings
The tug of wars on Strike Dunham and Dap Dunlap
The Jesus Shuttlesworths and what it took to become that
The phone booth can be where you change or where you pump at
My heroes took turns wit who would run that
So for all the Pierre Delacroixs, the Man Tans and Sleep-N-Eats
And all the money from hand to hands that we can keep


I live amongst the proud neighbors who bang louder than Al-Qaeda
Moving them keys like Cal Tjader for the cheese like Sal's Famous
Fiends looking for houses where the rock's probably cooking
On the corners we BBQ on the block parties in Brooklyn
The birthplace of Jordan, you wore them if you was hard enough
Fucking with Nikes, why you think the Spike's so popular?
The block is like a prison with night vision they watching us
On top of us with binoculars to properly get the drop on us
I'm topical like Clockers cause crack kills
They making a movie, but I'm making black films with my rap skills
They standing on the corners looking vexed, looking stressed
Having to stoop to new lows like Brooklyn steps
First fight in Fort Greene, got respected in Brooklyn Tech
Spike's joint across the street, of course I was looking fresh
Now I'm coming for what's mine, the hoarders call it extortion
40 acres and a Porsche with more than 400 horses, yeah!


One of the few who had his pops out the whole block
Told me never to settle or let the dough stop
Leave here with as much as you can hold Sky
And point blank 'em if they ever come at yo' tie
Made me follow every script that Spike ever wrote
So how I write is cuz of them
Rightfully so
The irony of wanting everything I could be shown
But seeing life like a Lee
Rightfully so",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-spike-lee-was-my-hero-lyrics
How To Make It Through Hysteria,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Growing up, project struck, looking for luck, dreaming
, me and
Couplets I was cupping up to the ceiling, seen it
Jumped in and was looking up to believe it
Lived it, went and penned it and left the rest to the speakers
Wrote it the way I know it, you heard it, you saw me show it
Outlining the obvi' and intricating below it
Dollar signs in the lobby and finger painting the motive
Any side that's beside me is giving way to the notice
Dare you to look away from it, counting it is weighing it
And the weight of the winners will build 'em to build a gate for it
Protect it or neglect it, skully over the face with it
The outcome surrounds them and everything they praying with
Dents in the carpet, the honor amongst saving it
Picturing tomorrow is prolly gonn' make today the end
Beat tapes blur out the blue, and all the chase in them
Lights out the window, the awakening

I'm feeling like I made it though
And if I made it yo
Then making it is everywhere that they ain't say to go
I'm making it where all of this is for the taking yo
Cause making it is everything that they been waiting fo'
I show 'em how to make it through hysteria
Make it through hysteria
Make it through hysteria
Made it through
Show 'em how

Know the sound, know the score well enough to quote it now
Used to what they used to, see them pointing the composer out
Suitor of the suitors, double breasted, money folded down
Rooted where the root is, found an exit they can go around
Sped you up to slow you down, fuck the curiosity
1,000 thread count but I was cut from where the bottom be
Powder spread 'round like they was dumping out their lottery
Freshened up the linen like embellishing an image
See it's sorta like the scene where Dukie get out the car
And Prezbo is watching a dream die from afar
And testers are getting thrown over on Popular Grove
And the rest of what you know is where the end of it starts
You hear the engine is gone, behind you is what it was
Hearing tends to be wrong but reminds you of what it does
Hearing it through the walls, oblige and get your run
And make sure to rewind it when you're done


Word to the hysteria that we tryna say we made it thru, and word to bringing everyone wit us to say ""shit I made it too"", whatever happens from here on out, I made it when they said I wouldn't make it I made it and I made it true, no hand outs used because none were ever given, I mean I can't say I wouldn't have accepted if a hand was ever risen, but none were so, why consider, when they didn't, they didn't consider my city or my block or my curb or my crib the way I did, and I didn't do any of this just to say I lived, I did it to say I'm in, in for whatever it might've been or it might be, or whatever's likely to push thru, not a hero just a good dude, moms and pops love me like cooked food and the front door was wide enough for me to do more than just look thru, so hey, why not at least take a stare, take it a step further and take it there, I mean really take it there and see what all the fuss is being made about and, admire the ones before us who made it out, getting autographs and picturing all of that as a blueprint for us and wishing for all of that, uh, 
see when I said I wrote on the back of light bills
 I really meant that, and whether you did or didn't get that, it is what it is, I mean it is what it is for that dream, and that dream is so vivid it don't even look like one, or so it seems, seems to us that whatever you leave for us is what it'll be for us, but fuck that becuz if that don't be enough then what does that mean for us?, confliction and contemplation and addiction and that itching and itching for what you missing and you inching to see what they taking or see what they paying, or see both sides and see why the song's been playing the way it's been playing and why it won't stop, couldn't stop it if you tried to, or better yet if you pretended you wasn't listening when really you knew every word in every sentence and every metronome in that rhythm, every hi hat and 808 you was given, the bass you know as well as the mirror you in front of, and well, either do it or don't but either or they can't judge us, so yea I wrote and I wrote because no one else spoke, no judge, no jury, just purely how it goes, and from the go I was who I am, the story's been one in the same just the way that you turn that page may have changed, long time coming since Chris or Shawn or Nasir or Corey or Brad first started to go, figured I'd do my part and draw up a path, and let it unfold, unfold like kites with picture requests and, homecoming dates and liquor requests and, shit, I stand tall for all of it if this is what's left, buying bottles last minute cuz see I'll never forget the date but I might forget the request, see my life's loaded at the moment and there's so many bottles to be bought that, I kinda get lost, but still here, and feeling like I made it though...",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-how-to-make-it-through-hysteria-lyrics
Everybody’s Fine,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"Celebratory moments of a glass or a bottle in the air
 
Or a flask and a shotti with a flare 
And the bag coming out when one appears 
Or the flash of a body in the stairs 
And the crash of a lobby in despair, 
Or. moments where you getting patted on the ground 
That then turn into badges on the ground, 
And the irony of reversing a role where whenever they roll 
Bet that they know that's whatever for them now, 
‘cause now is a scene where a stream is interrupted 
By conclusion jumping and dumping into a seat 
Where a dream is sitting in overdrive so taking over the drive 
Turns into 12 acquitting the screams, or 12 acquitting what they believe, 
Until they're in the crowd banking on what another 12 perceives 
Or celebratory moments of a scale being off to the left 
So you cop and get more than you expect 
And the rest goes off to the cost of looking like you're involved 
So you back to spending more with your connect, 
Connecting like interlocking the latch 
When a latch key is cocking it back 
Knowing a latch leads to how to react, 
And the reaction is counter react, 
It gets complicated like confiscating the lottery back, 
It comps a way in like finding a pack, 
Or it comps a weigh in like you was conned into buying it back, 
Back tracking to the moments that inspired the toast, 
To the half gallon of Henny for supplying you hope, 
Til you're back to backing the semi from inside of your coat, 
Either that, or standing on the other side of the scope, 
Or, it's a celebration of being nowhere near where that aim is, 
Trigger fingers turn to quotations, 
Same fingers boxing you in will leave you vacant,
 
Round of applause down the hall for all your patience, 
Or you in a hall, up on the wall, 
With department of corrections letters hovered up over where your name is, 
Or you by the door, cap and gown to the floor, 
8 years of proof hovered up over where your name sits, 
Draw you to the crown, they sell it to you as weightless
 
And charge you to sit on their wait list, 
Then you fast forward, private parking the Porsche, open the doors 
To a round of applause down the hall from all your patients,
 
Fists in the air over mistakes, or fists in the air over the jakes 
Being vision impaired holding a tre, 
And that tre pound lift up the fear from out his face 
And you vision impaired over a wake, 
For the face that the jakes pinned as being a nigga 
So he gives him everything that he thinks a nigga should take, 
And you ask him how he spell it and he responds 
""please make up your mind, you niggers is either niggers or you ain’t”, 
All black everything, 
Bobby Seale
 fit with a tre 
While I'm untwisting my chains, 
Celebratory moments of a glass or a bottle in the air 
Or a flask and a shotti with a flare 
And the bag coming out when one appears 
Or the flash of a body in the stairs 
And the crash of a lobby in despair, 
Recalled by the store til the morn' while you borrowing a square 
And they're watching what you hear, but everybody's fine...",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-everybodys-fine-lyrics
Money Makes Us Happy,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"Scared to death
By this race I've run
All that's left, is everything I want
And I'm slowly losing my time
Quickly taken back from me
Seems my friends are few
Mama said prepare to pay
Cause happiness comes from money
Happiness comes from money

Money makes us happy and, happiness is everything
And everything is now and, now is more than never and
There'll never be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so
If you can quote the prices of your happy then get at us yo
Get at us yo, learned it from right where you saw me posted at
Grew up holding on to it all unless there's hope attached
Cause me?, I don't hope for much, uh, if anything at all
They said your cue will depend on what you can bring along
So we was bringing everything that mattered to us most
It was money and it was cars and it was habits to keeping both
It was hundreds and it was scars and they just happened to be close
It was hunger getting involved so then it was back to being broke
And we just wanted a shot or 2, Melo on the follow through
Promised me it would open these doors the way that they promised you
So I just do, whatever it takes to fuck with it all
And enough to buy my way next to Jesus if I get lost, swag


And they say money makes the world go, money makes your girl go
Money turns some of its earners into something terrible
Ask yourself where did the person who was in the mirror go?
Why am I unrecognizable, so unbearable?
In the pursuit of paper, it was then I wasn't there with you
To do it over I'd've taken better care of you
It costs money for the birth, more for the burial
Purposely I'm saving up to purchase us a miracle
We want more but need less
, desires and requests
I guess moving constantly at this rapid speed just
Effected my velocity, then the evil got to me
And strangely, it fucked around and changed my philosophy
I always heard it's not the quantity but it's the quality
In all honesty, past mistakes seem to follow me
Sometimes I feel like if my psychology will swallow me
So my apologies, what's my problem yo?, it's gotta be the money


And it was falling out the sky like if Doug E. Fresh was performing
And we already had too much and so we was brushing it off us
In pictures in front of back drops til like 4 in the morning
In all of this Dapper Dan for all of your dapper adornment
Or its falling on the badge in the murder of pick a name
And my name fill the blank and I'm blanked and I drift away
And you kiss my cold cheeks, chicks crying like I was Cochise, would you stand up
And send me a slow speech?, because money makes us happy and, happiness is
Everything, and everything is now and, now is more than never and, there'll never
Be a moment where happiness doesn't matter so, if you can quote the prices of
Your happy then get at us yo

Money
No surrender now and no restraints
No complaints
(Lord knows the price will only raise)",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-money-makes-us-happy-lyrics
The Knowing,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Fitted like you're in front of a step and repeat
I'm listening to everyone tryna get you to leave
When they finished I'm over here, letting you breathe
And my fitted is all grey if you check underneath
Meaning I'm on that side, opposites attract right?
And I'm attracted to getting rid of your past like
Everything you need, you believe and you react like
No one ever did this, they had you underprivileged
Cause you was in your mirror for a reason though
6 for them murder heel's, I'm guessing you keeping those
Keeping those means you'll be breaking them in around the Stuy
The truth will prolly get you a win, I'm not surprised
They making you wanna leave, I got you thinking to stay
I'm here to get in your talk, they here to get in your way
I'm here to be what they wasn't, here to be why you love it
Hearing me got you buzzing but scared to give me a play


I knew it, you feel like you know-me
So you don't wanna leave here & feel like you owe-me
I already knew it, you feel like you know-me
You holding back just as much as you wanna show-me

See the thing about it is
I don't know what it is
But I wanna find out
Why am I feeling like
I know you, I know you
I know you, yeah, I swear

Your friends tell you let it go
Like ""yea he fly but he'll never do the X & O's""
Maybe they're right, or maybe they have yet to know
Maybe tomorrow when we wake up you can tell em though
Pardon me, but, I be knowing baby, I be knowing
And you looking like you ain't looking for nothing they be throwing, right?
I agree, so when you tryna leave
Say the word and I'll follow words and follow leads
However it gotta be as long as you get to live a little
Henny straight, I promise you it'll benefit you
Feeling like you wanna see if it can get you there
Balmain mini dress, let it disappear
In your ear with the opposite of the man before me
I got no game its just some women understand my story
I'm wit it if you wit it
And drive back prepping you for all that you been missing


I swear that I know you
What you saying I already know
As much as I know you
I still wanna hear mo'
I swear that I know you
But I'm still all yours
I swear that I know you
I know you, I know you, yeah
I swear",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-knowing-lyrics

The beautiful decay
We call this the beautiful decay
We call this the beautiful decay
We call this the beautiful decay

Majority rules, all of that is just a part of the rules
And a majority of us is just a part of the cool
I'm a part of how's it cut like I'm a part of the tool
And I'm the part that's in the front like ""pardon me dude""
The authentic, the scriber for every one who subscribes
To dollar shots of Henny with chicken wings and fries
For $3.75 and what it took to get that
Pen to the pad, I paint it but don't drip that
Huh, OD with the pen on the low key
And I become the back drop, when you trippin in OT
The theme music for peddlers, call me what you want
But I leave room for measurers, I'm on it from the jump
And them? They clown scopin, hopin the clouds open
I pen both sides, the poetry's now motion
Pray to God that the car ain't halted
Beautiful decay is what we call it

So beautiful, so gorgeous but so opposite of all this

B-K my home and Southside my cushionin
Live from the bottom, made it out alive. I survive from the bottom
But when pushin a ride, I don't slide on the bottom
Any part of the lane that's been part of the game
Is in the heart of my name
My growth is Now and Later and quarter water infused
Now take a look at what quarter waters could do
Tell 'em the best laws get X'd off, it's panoram
When next door is stretch raw and hand to hands
In junior high, I rocked pennies, rolled dice
And threw on the ""Purple Tape"" before I would go and write
Bapitized in it, clear as day
And that side of me came from the staircase

Freeze framin it, see how they keep playin it
It's picture perfect, you could go either way with it
So when they start runnin with somethin that's all casted
I brush off the front of my Jordans and walk past 'em
Please don't believe in everything that you listen to
Everything you listen to is everything they didn't do
Everything they didn't do is everything they want to say
Everything they want to say is everything you want to play (woo)
But for the beautiful, I could find the decay in it
I take the newest light bill and the pen to the basement and
Use the back of that light bill to write what I'm sayin and
Hope that it keep your lights on when you playin it

For What It’s Worth,The Salvation,2009.0,"It so, basic that we all want to be famous and noticed and watched
And we all want money and riches and want
We all want the finest out of life
From a, from the most heartless gangbanger
To the most ah, virtuous police officer
AND we're all um, human beings
So we're all susceptible to our own weaknesses
Temptation is a very strong weakness

There's too much money in cocaine for me to be playin the broke game
Or at the nine to five with the no names
But here I be, nine to fifthin it with all of them no names
Tryin to figure out who I'm gon' blame
For where I be and where I be is nothin that I ever dreamed
Everything I'm turnin into was never me
None of this was scripted
Or maybe it was and I was too blind to get this
And maybe because I was too blind to get this
I threw it to the street
But look at me, I'm makin up excuses as we speak
See the reality of it is, it's easier to be cold out then bundled in
And he who be on the slow route is runnin thin
Or so it seems and now I'm treadmillin my life on a lower speed
All that really matters is a profit
Tomorrow I handle the aftermath of how I got it
Fuck all of the worryin and all of the second guessin
I don't got time to deal with a second question
Life is what you make it be and everything in life is shaped to be
I vow to turn it 'round and then bow gracefully
Not enough reasons to say no
And too many reasons to say yes and I ain't pressed to say so
Been dealin with the same dollar and the same dream
Lost between Plans A and B

And this is for what it's worth
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
I'm just tryin to be what I can be

Time keeps walkin, walkin away from me
Huh, so for what it's worth
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
But it feels like time keeps talkin
Time keeps talkin and I don't understand what it say

There's too much money in heroin for me to pretend to be negligent
I'm ignorin it more than I ever did
And I can't lie, they say all it take is time to better it
But my clock is lookin foreverish
Like why can't I, be blessed with a more blessed set of wings
I see less as more or less everything
More or less everything that I ever wanted is all gone
And replaced with what I've been runnin from all along
So why even entertain the chase?
Why even pretend I was built to stay in this race?
The truth is my sweetest dream
Is so far from my hands that I don't even reach
I'm so far from a plan that right now, anything'll do
Cause if the lullabies that the corner sing is true
Then hit the play button and I'll be down until it's gone
All the hopes that use to be become the sounds within the songs
And with that said, I say ""Good Morning America""
Say it once more just in case it wasn't clear enough
""Good Morning America"", this is what your dreams are made from
As well as what your dreams could break from
Ignorin all the risks, all the cops, all the enemies
All the nameless bullets that could be namelessly sent to me
All the fame from pullin it and all of the fame
From bein on the wrong side, which one do you claim?
 - w/ ad libs
For what it's worth
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
But it feels like time keeps walkin
Time keeps walkin, walkin away from me
Huh, so for what it's worth
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
But it feels like time keeps talkin
Time keeps talkin and I don't understand what it say

Turned down every offer I was given
Regardless of the wrath or the temp, I'm pivot
And I'm just tryin to keep it straight and narrow
But I'm seein Satan's arrow and it's hard not to get hit with it
I'm duckin low and prayin that it all pays at the finish line
And that I don't have to pay for it when it's dinner time
But bein honest, left never looked so right
And that corner never looked so bright
The outcome ain't worth tryin not to be not outdone
Outrun what you can but where you run out from'll
Always be your home base
Until you lookin back home with a stone face
All the shit that you fall for is twinge with your dreams, all gone
You question if your questions were all wrong
You seein how it changed, each side of the game
Cause your pink slips is they bullets, neither got a name, damn

For what it's worth
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
I'm just tryin to be what I can be
But it feels like time keeps walkin
Time keeps walkin, walkin away from me
For what it's worth
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
I'm just tryin to make what I can make
But it feels like time keeps talkin
Time keeps talkin and I don't understand what it say",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-for-what-its-worth-lyrics
Pockets Full,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"How they talking it but ain't living it?
That Spade pop, I'm sipping it, made mine deliberate
Made mine in remembrance of a couple of doors down
Cause when you neighbors wit the greatest your applause sounds
Madison Square like, I rap for where its like
If nothing else is saving you then packaging squares might
They told me that I got it to Basquiat it
Brought you so close to it you thought YOU was buying product
Vividly I, forefront em when they sit on the sides
I gave em Linderella stories and the city obliged
I'm in a city of Gods and needles and Foamposites
Singing line for the line and see how this dope got us
Arms length, jeeps with dark tents
Damier Louis shit, Tisa's in all prints
For the desire of everything they deny us
They ask to define us tell em dreaming's the problem
So if you see us anywhere its pockets full

Pockets full
Pockets full of now
So know that if we down
We'll be down til we counting all around
And counting til we out
Tell em pockets full

My pockets was empty til I flipped and tripled my profit
I'm similar to Skyzoo, attempted to sky rocket
Posted by them benches serving them smokers that buy product
As hopeless as I had it, not bragging but baby I made it
Out the city where them people will bang
Flamers and double back, clap and shoot your dame in the same
Evening, your city ain't wild as ours, Philly raise heathens
Y'all city raise divas like Billy Ray Cyrus
Freezer count cheese, get green like I'm Irish
Flow wavy, I'm about to set seas like a pirate
Call the navy up, tell 'em Team Early up, wilding
I ain't talking 'bout the drink when I say its hypnotic
These rappers far from goblins and they're not goons
And when I'm flowing on the beat the pocket's full
Used to post up on the street, tell 'em cop and move
Now I bully booths, I got a lot to prove, tell them fools my pockets full


We grew up singing keep your eyes open & your wallet in your front pocket
Riding along gave us one option
Riding along to the drum knocking, like yea the drums got this
And God forbid if the drums stopping
But if they ever do, then all we ever knew
Was so for real we can hand em what we've yet to lose
Soul For Real baby, candy coated residue
And know the drill if them cameras ever get to you, fuck it we on tho",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-pockets-full-lyrics
Jansport Strings,A Dream Deferred,2012,"One time up for Chi Ali
Cuz I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
My mama prayed that I wouldn't be Chi Ali
Now my mama straight cuz I wanted to be Chi Ali
They say my Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together
My Jansport strings was tying it all together, and now that new thing got me riding out for whatever

One time up, sowing the sides up
Hometown heroes, like you know where to find us
Looking over your shoulder like I'm slowing the ride up
First time listeners, they ain't kno what a line was
Blue & orange everything, loaded the line up
Got em looking for lines like they hope they can tie up
A spoon full of 'ron when I shoot & give a bar
Give or take, I'm in a space that's usually regarded
For wakes or living aces, truthfully regardless
Look at who they telling me to par with
Pardon me though, bred different so I'm arguably so
You arguing over crowns dude arguably no
I was fitted to wear that fitted and wear that living
For the living, you hear that penning?, well yea that did it
I mean, its all just as real as they say
And blame Chi if anybody is feeling a way, one time


Doing numbers, tryna do the summer
Dreaming outta control, said we tryna coupe the Hummers
Leaning out of a hole like we tryna duck the edges
And leaving papi alone cuz we out here running credit
Young, early 90's in the heart of the K
Saw the servers, corners had targets for days
Any reason is a go, how they squeezing you should know
Draped in Columbia jackets, beepers & Girbauds
I mean, played lockers wit tomorro's front pagers
White & purple huaraches, tryna murder the lobby
I mean, all we knew is what we saw first
Wheels up for whatever til it all works
And I tell 'em one time up for Chi Ali
Cause I could be in a box if I ain't see that screen
Grey basements on all of my fitteds
, if I'm on then we did it
Applaud wit it if you see my lead, one time",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-jansport-strings-lyrics
Dear Whoever,The Salvation,2009,"The life of Kings and everything we call it
The realization of everything that we forfeit
The last scene of the night, with no applaudin
Tryin to circle back to when the curtains were called in
I talk to you, cause you told me to throw my all in
And now it feels like I'm too far in
Told me regardless, as long as I could show you where the heart is
Another day shouldn't be a problem
But now the more I come to you, the more it feel like, real life
Couldn't of been built right, you told me to still write
Said that you would help me make sense of it all
And we would never have to censor our talks
So I told you everything, I never worried about if you could hear
I assumed your attention was a sign of how you cared
See with you, I was different, I ain't try to hide fear
Nor anger, nor excitement
Played you my life as, quick as I was livin it
Gave you my life as, quick as I could give you it
And never had a second thought
Hopin is for the better and forever more
I put you in front of everyone around me
From the first moment that you found me
BFF, I fell for it, by far I fell
And you was the help for it that I would call myself
So if your ears are off or tainted in the least
Then how can I explain this to me?

So now I'm like - dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever
Dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever
Forever, forever

In all honesty, plannin on how to leave
Is just more proof of the fact that I'm all out of me
Just more truth that exactly the way I tried to be
Was either too much or not enough
No middle ground, so to talk to you and pen it down
Is not as easy no more, I think different now
The idea of tellin you what I wouldn't repeat
Only for you to be wrong is what I couldn't believe
Ran to you anytime I was lookin for me
And I took your advice on how to carry it
No barriers, no doubtin you
Until doubt was the only thing I knew how to do
When the doors close on me, day ones fold on me
You would get a hold of me and tell me to word it
But shit is gettin old on me, shit is monotone homie
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Feelin like everyone before me who support me
Is deservin of a reason to applaud me
And if I ain't able to give 'em that much
Due to how we matched up
I could of scripted out a different story
I threw all caution to the wind, when you told me it was worth it
And pictured that the picture would be perfect
At the end of the day, dear notebook, thanks for all the listens
But we should probably both stop pretendin


Dear whoever, dear whoever, dear whoever
When I put this together
Felt like severin ties, may work better
Felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Be the best thing for the both of us, forever",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-dear-whoever-lyrics

Huh, know what we be on
First ones to it, everything is FGR

Uh, designer sweats off designer plugs
My fan base peddle krills or designer drugs
Money hand over fist like a Steiner glove
Drop jeep, box seats what I remind you of
Aura of the city, everything that I came for
In a carry-­on, I carry on like a wave board
Handing work to whoever like if my aim gone
Fly murder forever like ""get your name Lord""
Devil wears Prada, Hitler wears Hermes
I be in Céline with your queen going burlesque
Either that or Supreme, I'm supremely the deity
Crowned off the point how I weave where the needle be
And it's leaving legendary if it come to me
Rep means everything, mine means luxury
And we tryna turn bread like Harpo
Talking Marlo with a Partlow arms fold, ha

If I don't make it bet the fam will
Watch the city fall in love with us, huh
Clyde Frazier with the hand skills, uh
Double rings baby, double up

Yo, wore the same Balmains outside for a week straight
Fronting like we ain't rich
Baddest chick you ever seen in your life
Pulling bottles all night like she won the chip
You know we here for the luxury, yea
You know we here for the luxury, yea
Until we filthy with the bank roll

Winning lasts forever baby, swear to God it's like we won already
Word to counting everything that we done drunk already
Only thing that they can say is that they wasn't ready
For real, salute to how we was brought up
Fly guy etiquette turned us into marauders
How I throw etiquette 'round the way they taught us
In short chains and Balmains how God want us, ha!
Luxury, see where that'll get you?
With a Cici Amor tryna be like Karen Civil
Print game silly so my Nike Tech gorgeous
Casper the friendly, writing for the Forbes list, ha
Yea, Earl the Pearl when I'm at it B
So who you love is being me, all flattery, ha
Flattered to be what they never was
First to the money, everything is FGR, do believe it though

Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech

And he said, the strap black like fab 5 apparel
Sweet 16 running laps outta the barrel
Said it sing lullabies that'll wrap you like a carol
Ducking that is like juggling laps with a Camaro
Counting turns into weighing when there's a market
Both sides of it just came in here for a target
One got a bottle awaiting covered in sparklers
The other got a dot, a aim, and a full cartridge
Empty that and your rep will jump out the room
Word of mouth, murder out, connecting you like a loop
Put your name in the lights or whatever you might assume
Til your rep's so high that your weapon done got a groove
Said the purchase as sweet as Amel Larrieux is
Strip something down with the bow, no cupids
Both hands on makes it easy for you to shoot with
Hands up will tell you you need it before you through with

My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
One by one, hand in hand with his connect
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Tell him what you can or can't do for a tech
My man said that he bamboo on the steps
Every 24 he done ran thru what was left

My man said that he bamboo by the benches
Hand you a coveted handle for the trenches
Custi' said there's beef in the scramble with his business
Copped one, blammed duke and it ran duke out his senses
Clientele spreads everything but his name
Even getting yelp reviews, shit is insane
The lane he was carving brought him one even wider
Roofless, drop jeeps and 645'ers
Ruthless, Eric and Jerry Heller conspirers
Like we gonn' get this loot up and won't a rumor divide us
Joints laid out in the trunk look like a line up
Ask how they got to the K, to no surprises
Dude wholesaling looks nothing like you and I but
You need son to get thru the door with no colliding
Funny thing about it you look inside of his ride and
He had a make America great hat on the side of him
Typical, clearing out the visuals
You walking with a Panther or here for residuals?
He said that they don't make 'em in the Stuy or the D or the Chi
But believe if they flying Ima sling a few

Baker’s Dozen,In Celebration of Us,2018.0," 
Corner store still open, it ain’t too late, 
Praise that in your arms like it’s a bouquet, 
Corner store still open, it ain’t too late, 
Praise that in your arms like it’s a bouquet, 
Right back outside, the way they want it, 
On line for the pie, baby who cutting? 
Right back outside, the way they want it, 
On line for the pie, baby who cutting? 

Bake the cake, bake the cake, bake the cake, Cut a piece, 
Some done lost their religion for the mark of the beast, 
Bismi ‘llahi Alhamdulillah So we pray to the east, 
See if there’s a heaven, there’s got be hell 
 
900,000 away from a first mil, 
Caught 100 large overnight like I work crills, 
My man identical with how his work builds, 
And how the 14th can feel like the first still, 
Swear to God that as long as it jumps nothing will change, 
And may he look at me and my Gz one in the same, 
Same money spent on the same trucks and the same chains, 
And the same superheroes agree that they take blame, 
Proud of it, 100 miles running, the whip moving, 
The stick stuck in the side door, the grip stupid, 
They had it how we wanted to have it and get into it, 
Word to the allure and word to the influence, 
Influenced by whatever becomes, whatever’s done
Disappear couple days out the month, Heckler runs, 
Let it run like rumors or the bags running to us, 
You be looking over past but tradition run the truest, do believe it 

Bake the cake, bake the cake, bake the cake, Cut a piece, 
Some done lost their religion for the mark of the beast, 
Bismi ‘llahi Alhamdulillah So we pray to the east, 
See if there’s a heaven, there’s got be hell 

One time for the love of the lead and the way it had us, 
And the irony of dotting the beam on whatever matters, 
Black lives in black 5s, the frame boxing out, 
I’m Luke Caging but more related to Cottonmouth, 
And we related to whoever made it 
And came back to park it in front of us and let us chase it, 
Came back talking in numbers over better wagers, 
All of my chains weigh enough for me to celebrate it, 
Heard em when they was saying to never leave until the plate done, 
And how it turns into better bitches with better lace fronts, 
I mean you either out or you on it, got it or want it, 
Same way 9 won’t cut it like ""find yo’ budget”, 
Regardless of who move up the block, the block's shaking, 
You moved in when they promised you that the block's vacant, 
New month coming tomorrow, you got patience?, 
Call it even, we got Richie, you got Reagan, do believe it 
 
Corner store still open, it ain’t too late, 
Praise that in your arms like it’s a bouquet, 
Corner store still open, it ain’t too late,

Brown paper bags for us all baby, touché,

The Cost of Sleep,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
And should you ever doze
You doze cautiously
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
The commas in the price tag
They talk to me
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
Should you ever doze
You doze cautiously
For the cost of sleep
And what it cost to sleep
Long as you never know
You know all you need

And knowing alone is for the low and behold
Low and behold I'm still the soul of the hole
But losing mine to be it, losing eyes to see it
Vision better but who am I to believe it
So losing mine to be it, losing eyes to see it
But its whatever if you decide on sleeping
True as Posturepedics, and laying there, listening
The same shit that drove Rich & them
Dvd stars off of fam going missing and
We just see the odds open handed, gripping them, vice city
See we involved from the entrance and
DWI in the car but I'm good on my intentions till them lights get me
So pay me now, pay me later, and for yesterday
Mite nod a little, but I was never late
Hurry up and buy
, like you ain't never wait, you lay down and you levitate
See if the twin mattress could talk the songs that it would harmonize
All the living I was living for the non alive
All the bitches that was in it wit they heart in mind
And all the women that was missing when my heart arrived
Pardon I, I was just was on a high
Peddler theme music but now I just wanna ride
And painting it for the Bose
You prayed that they car wasn't halted, and now you just praying that they don't doze


Publishing checks and letters from jail
Come to me at the same time, that's my regular mail
Honest, they say the cost of success could weigh out your living
But what it cost for that rest will pay out the difference
And what we on is to the left, made to be different
If we was wrong from the get we'll stay to revisit
Now sing a song for the rep but change up the endings
Cuz we put on to the death, may he forgive us
For everything that we can count on
The overall is getting my amount on
Something I can mount on and say that this was worth it
If I should ever doze it just brings me down to perfect
Cause me I'm never faded, I made it where he made it
Hope it don't end the same but we get the same payment
Hope that I get my name scripted in the same cadence
Know I be in my ways but I feel like I'm the greatest
At least among these new mu'fuckas that was born in the 80's and better
Called it 
Dickensian
 when I got to playing wit letters
Call up Larenz and them and tell them that tape is forever
But what its 'bout is everything that you doubt
Applause for the 2 doors and the keys for the entry
And please y'all please don't tempt me
Leave me in this corner wit these stanzas alone
You figure this out, you'll see I stand on my own, receipts in the bag


Me I'm never faded, I made it where he made it
Hope it don't end the same but we get the same payment
Hope that I get my name scripted in the same cadence
Know I be in my ways but I feel like I'm the greatest",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-cost-of-sleep-lyrics

Pockets full, but you laying there, I can't afford
But I'll be good baby, maybe this is hand in arm
And we was just getting our handle on, wonderful night
Shit I never seen, shit that you never felt
Wanting to never leave, twisting whatever's dealt
Talking to let it be, listening when you melt
Still on my G, baby, let it tell
Tell you what you love and picturing me to mean it
Told me ""give that up Sky, I want it and I need it""
And you ain't have a prob showing me the way you keep it
Like this will go beyond where we are, fuck a reason
And I can love or leave it, but I ain't leaving none of this to part with
So I'll just play the part for the bargain
You put it where your heart is, baby I ain't mean it
Its not that I ain't want to, its just that I ain't see it
Just call it Drew & Derwin

We made the night
We made it a wonderful night
I didn't wanna fall in love
I thought that one time was enough
But tonight, if we do it all again
I hope we don't fall in love
Let's just make tonight
Another wonderful night

Two finger hooking your murder heels
Memories double timing, look like you're hurt for real
We never pictured last night becoming today
We both wanted us, shit we one in the same
Carrying on like I'm with it all
Laying underneath you and treating you like this is yours
Word to the Mags and the bottles of Cavit that's by the dresser
I build walls after I compress 'em
I'm told that I turn cold, giving them hard dick and
Straight to the hole like Kemba Walker it was taking its toll
And feeling awkward is the way I suppose that this supposedly goes
Cuz on the low I'm supposed to be home
And you'll prolly meet a dude who's due up to find a role
And after like a month, dude will prolly propose
And I'll applaud it, and all that it's coming with
I'm nowhere near that, I usually run from it, just call it Drew and Derwin


Hope we don't, hope we don't
Fall in love, fall in love

And it was nice while it lasted, right?
I gave you mic, you gave me adlibs, right
It wasn't right but that was past tense
I guess that I wouldn't be mad if
You was to move on and pretend I never happened
You giving me all, just pretend that never mattered
You gripping the walls, and getting on your ladder
Let's call it time lost, let's put that all in back of us
And leave that over there",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-drew-and-derwin-lyrics
Glass Ceilings,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Figure its A Clockwork Orange how I'm pardoned wit the top of it
Leave it up to me to see the bottomless, bottom is
Meaning what the moral or the object of the riding is
Told 'em all before, no Radames, riding with
All or nothing now, couple dreams in a duffle
Damier's all around it
, 
guess a dream might run you
And the run's a 100 yarder, the dash mite barter
And you tryna shake a Dash like a Carter
I'm tryna play the back as a starter, the irony in that
Wanting all of it but wanting no part of the react
I react like, all we ever wanted was to be up
Nobody could guard us but regardless they should lead us?
Still playing ringer, told me chill while they king him
Background live or die, they can still raise a finger
Those around us can see the same tent
Windex the roof, it only makes sense

It's all glass ceilings
All glass ceilings
Tryna see whatever
All for that feeling
High enough to let up
Low enough to feel it
Probably forever
Blowing thru the ceiling

Looking for it 'til its all said
And then it feels like when they killed Cornbread
Or Cochise, or Voletta's son
The common thread?, its prolly better if you never run
Or find a ledge that you can level if they ever come
I'm 'bout this bread, God bless you if I'm ever shunned
Say I took it just the way that I was taught to
You wait and you'll be laid when they applaud you
You say that if I lost you there's nothing left to seek out
I say that if I lost you, you wasn't supposed to be found, so we out
We out, outside living like this outside living wasn't out the side limits
Or living like the roof up above us wasn't loose enough to touch us
Mu'fuckas wasn't true enough to love us
And all of those around us can see the same 
tent
Windex the roof, it only makes sense


Big money in my sentence
Sleep ain't what it was, it come a little different
If we can't cover up then cut a little distance
Each and everyone of us just want it how we live it",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-glass-ceilings-lyrics
Sound Like...,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"It sounds like we back to the part where you get reminded, 
Where catching everything that you thought will make you rewind it,
 
Like everything you knew that you caught, you still behind it, 
So everything you get is in parts, like it's consignment, 
Part of it sounds more like sitting under the floor might, 
Be enough to sit you above what all the applause like, 
And all of the applause is singing in uniform right?, 
And then you take note what these harmonies can harm like 
It sounds like smoke outta the scope how the grey on, 
And then the smoke clears and everybody you play gone, 
And may yall, continue to pray on who you root on, 
Like stay on and make a seance out of a nuance, 
And say y'all get in the way of what I been due on, 
My catalog is like Avon meets brother Mouzone

Threw y'all a 3 peat and we bout to part 4 it, 
You either part for it or parkour it 

This what it sound like, 
When you give the sound light, 
And everything above it wind up under the ground like, 
If everything above it is the reason it sound right, 
Then it was cut from it but it's cut out around like... bet it that...

It sounds like raising a .45 and making the floor rise 
All while explaining apartheid, 
All while changing a car ride to aiming at off sides 
All while playing the Pharcyde, and pray if the car dies, 
That you was low enough to get lost by 
Whoever had a set on your door side, 
Closer than a rear view, low as it appears to, 
Where they grow weight and throw weight like Amir do, 
And at The Roots of it all there be more to adhere to, 
Say to do what you do with your arms if you can bear to, 
It sounds like a fist in the air meets a brick in the air 
Meets baguettes meets the vision impaired, 
Or it sounds like visions in pairs 
And depending on how you pronounce both is what'll get to appear, 
It sounds like rug money that turn into plug money 
That turn into overturning the plug's money, this what it sound like 

This what it sound like, 
When you give the sound light, 
And everything above it wind up under the ground like, 
If everything above it is the reason it sound right, 
Then it was cut from it but it's cut out around like... bet it that...

And bet it that it sounds like a run that ain't nobody ever ran on, 
Ship it how I whip it, no dance on, you get your Stan on 
For whoever they got you beside, 
Until your G drop out when it be time to align, 
Line up like twelve when they be Tryna collide, 
They add you on by Tryna divide, another time, 
Know me, know I put the sublime in the subliminal, 
Your fanbase wanna bid something, mine done did a few, 
And when your fave is spitting that shit and you seem surprised, 
I'm Eric betting with Kyle, I'm feeding 'em from behind, 
Word to Kenny, all this works, who working with me?, 
‘cause it was either work out a verse or work a semi, 
Box out like Hakeem, 30/20, 
Threw the pump fake and they’re thinking I work for semi,
 
'lotta lines, I’ll leave you the time to go and break those, 
Meanwhile I'm ducking from plain clothes 
'cause this what it sounds like...

When you give the sound light, 
And everything above it wind up under the ground like, 
If everything above it is the reason it sound right, 
Then it was cut from it but it's cut out around like... bet it that...",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-sound-like-lyrics
The Purpose,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"She was looking for what they speak about, 
Becoming such a believer now, the more that she be around, 
The more that she see a reason to see it out, 
Thinking like ""how could I be without?”, 
And without question, without guessing to figure out the connection 
And being in it and leaving her dealings out by the exit, 
And knowing the baddest bitches is eating off her reflection, 
Crown holder, remember to lean when you accept it, 
Let it, be the company, 
That attracts the same when you be in need of company, 
Til you believe in company, 
She said ""it weigh more than you think, so keeping company 
Can seem overrated if you don't own your patience”, 
Said it go for the taking as far as taking it goes, 
And you'll be forever mistaken if your stake in it grows, 
Type of shit that keep you nervous, 
Like how this just the surface?, and how no one deserved it?, 
Shit that give you purpose 

And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 
 
Word to my love
Word to my time
Word to my heart
If your love is divine 
Can you give me something more than I can see through?, 
'Cause I just wanna trust and believe you, 
And the purpose of it 

And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 

And so when I seen her, it was like
She was at a point where she might be out, 
But figured out what she might've found, 
Talking finder's keepers, when you find it you keep it and bring the light around, 
Especially how they lifting the prices now, 
She shows that off by all means, 
Along with the heels that's walking thru y'all dreams, 
She moves like ""pardon me"", I'm moving like ""par please, 
I just came here for her”, 
You feel like you did the same but couldn't stay for the worth, 
So you broke before you broke thru, 
I was in line for the dope like I'm a local, 
And I taught her what hope do, 
Said she heard about it but it only made her hopeful, 
And I ain't getting high alone so I sling her the dope too, 
To see her prophecy, her ebony tone is locking me, 
The way she moan when she be taking the whole 9 from me, 
Fucking up a bottle of privilege while we debating, 
I point out what a privilege it is to see her sacreds 

And the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 
 
Word to my love
Word to my time
Word to my heart
If your love is divine 
Can you give me something more than I can see through?, 
'Cause I just wanna trust and believe you,

Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho 

Where she's able to see tho, was all she thought was left for her to see, 
Told her I would be remiss if I ain't catch her up to me, 
Made a part, play the part, getting dressed for her beliefs, 
Told me those was Botticelli's when I swept her off her feet, 
Knew the issue, but seen between the hands, 
Cool on triple, Kima Keisha Pam,
 
I pull up in the new shit, see how we can work this, 
I bring up her tomorrows, she bringing up the purpose, 
And feeling like the purpose of it 

And the purpose of us being here, 
Is us agreeing on how everything we see in here 
Is nothing that we ever saw before, so to be in here, 
Is us assuming we won’t ever have to leave from here, 
You said all you wanted was a purpose or a reason where, 
You would never have to doubt what you believe in here, 
And I’m looking at you like whoever used to be in here, 
Made it tough for us to breathe in here, 
Because the purpose of it, as far as she know, 
Is finding what they told her she could have wherever she go, 
But knowing where they told it was at it wouldn't be tho, 
Way up out the way from where she able to see tho",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-purpose-lyrics
Black Sambo,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown, 
Mama said now that you got it don't ever put it down, 
Mama I swear I swear I'll never put it down, 
They gonn' have to kill me first 'fore it ever hit the ground 

And if it ever hit the ground, 
Bet that I'm next to it off of catching me a round, 
The only way I could ever be beheaded from the crown 
They wanted me to ignore 'cause they said that it amounts 
To a door where allure is as heavenly as it sounds 
But the floor that you on could levitate off the ground 
And you off to the call of speculating on how 
You could want what you want but never get to surmount 
What you saw, to tell them what you saw, 
Is telling them you was willing to peddle to front, 
And being in front will put you ahead of who belongs 
Til you leaking up under who you could never prove wrong, 
You'll never prove them wrong, right? 

How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown, 
Mama said now that you got it don't ever put it down, 
Mama I swear I swear I'll never put it down, 
They gonn' have to kill me first 'fore it ever hit the ground

Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Umbrella up that I can't close, 
You try to corner me but I can't fold 
They said I'm black sambo, 
Bright Bape hoodie by the lamp post, 
Hands in the air but my hands closed 
Is my instinct if you stand close, how close? 

Close enough where a name 
Can fully be re-cited if I'm ever on a stage 
With a judge pre-siding over everything that changed 
When 12 was replying to an image that was saved 
Of looking to creep by him with a desi’ on the waist 
Or wanting a seat by him while you stepping out the way, 
You take up the seat by him and he guessing why you came, 
He think that he seems fine but he left it on his face, 
And his face?, same one he giving you now, 
Remember you close enough where you can single him out, 
He know that you know low enough to know what limits allow, 
So believe him to open up and close your memory out, 
Like such, lights up, all eyes like the coke price cut, 
Whole time it'll throw a slight rush, 
All rise like loading up the pump, 
And you'll never prove them wrong, right?

Hands in the air but my hands closed 
Is my instinct if you stand close, how close? 

Too close for a loop hole to be the reason why you go 
To the hole where the loop froze, 
And then it repeats, and then you hoping that the loop broke, 
And the truth go, stretched out like Manute Bol, 
They press y'all like suit clothes, and them suit clothes, 
Couldn't save you from the type of stereo 
That they're willing to shoot fo', and the loop hole, 
Turns blacker than the light 
That they had you under when they handed you a mic 
And they asked you whether you was acting outta fright 
When they asked you if you was out trafficking tonite, 
Then they're at you with an automatic outta rights, 
Facebook Live panorama with your life, 
And that view goes from the cameras to the lights 
Til they tell son that he had every right, 
You’ll never prove them wrong, right?

How they said a little black Sambo could never fit a crown,

Honor Amongst Thieves,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"Do you believe, in honor amongst thieves, 
And celebrating making it out here in one piece, 
Or better yet taking it out on who couldn't leave, 
And everything relating to how you want it to be,
 
Do you believe, in knowing whatever you might have seen, 
Was all just a part of what we was titled to be, 
It was all in the song when we was finding the key, 
But singing along wouldn't show what entitlement means, 
Do you believe, In you being told how to be you, 
Where everything you are is supposedly not in cue, 
From mimicking to you being told how to improve,
 
And how you benefit depends on you following suit, 
Do you believe, That you can be taught how
 to be who you already was before you was bogged down, 
Like ""this is what best represents y'all, nevermind the fact that I've yet to step in your yard or ever been that involved”, 
Do you believe, In loading a .44 and blowing the corridor 
For all that you want for, but learning the court of law
 
Could never be cornered off, unless you were one of them, 
Would you just call it off, 
Or do you believe, That you can be given it off of privilege, 
And you can pass that to whoever you coming in with, 
And that'll lock arms like deciding that you get it
 
But the timing of it proves that you didn't, 
I mean do you believe

Do you believe, do you believe in it all, 
Being amongst honor if thieves get involved, 
Or being amongst honor if believing what you want 
Becomes more than you ever would’ve thought, 
I mean do you believe 

There was a story of a kid who had his father everyday, 
And his father had the grip but he also had a name,
 
Off of more than just the grip, it was off of how he changed, 
And it was all because his kid wasn't supposed to be the same, 
But the story of his friends was from off a different page, 
So his father was the difference under all that he became, 
But he still was with whatever, they could call him any day 
And they would get to it together, every part of him remained, 
Then the kid had a moment where it all rearranged 
When some kids unloaded on his partner for a name,
 
And the kid saw it all from the draw to the aim 
And he felt like he was woke enough to want all of the blame, 
And an idea came to get the grip like his pops, 
And have a conversation and end it with a shot
And it all made sense til he was picturing his pops 
And as much as he regretted it, he felt he'd better not, 
And, then there was a kid watching all of the above 
With his pops in a theatre and it caught him like a drug,
 
He was hooked on the idea of wondering if son 
Should've stayed to the end and started talking with his gun, 
Cause he felt if it was him then, all of the above 
Would've took a different spin that would've started with a slug 
That would've spun someone around til he was coughing up blood 
And, tucked him underground and it'd be all from outta love, 
But, love made his pops breakdown what it was like 
To have to keep a trey pound and spray it out on sight 
And how it ain't no turning back when you surrounded by them lights, 
Cause he had a ton of moments where the pound saved his life, 
And he listened and it wasn't hard to get what he was proving, 
But he still caught visions of him picking up and shooting, 
Cause he knew if it was him that his friends would jump into it, 
Since they ain't have fathers that could give them an influence, 
And the more he realized the balance of both sides, 
When his pops said ""protect yours, let no one overstep yours, 
But know that when you step on, ain't no stepping away, 
It sticks with you forever like how I'm here everyday”, 
But he still taught me how to load up, just in case,
 
And due to my composure alotta moments were saved, 
Now knowing everything you just heard and what it made, 
Let me know what you would prefer further explained,

Heirlooms & Accessories,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"Hand off like it was potent, 
Or like it was emotions, or like it was reloaded, 
Or like it was the start of what you was starting to go with, 
And as soon as you started it every part of you noticed, 
Coupes out in front of the 'jects, tall numbers, 
Or cooped into whatever's left that they bought from us, 
Shop don't close 'cause the neighbors change, 
Same way cops know to roll when the date say 
The 1st to the 3rd, a g-pack could make it all seem better, 
Until it's paddy wagon car seat weather, 
That's year round, the thought of who's here now interrupting a sale, 
Or pulling up on a Citibike and wanting some crills, 
It's all basic, 
Venmo begging, call it patience,
 
Know if you get caught up with them, the call changes, 
Dusse by the cases, do say what's the wagers, 
And please do believe they do say what your name is, for real 

Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 
Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 

Two states over to stay up under, 
Numbers ain't matching but you can still make these wonders, 
Like, wonder if all of these pieces is still shooting, 
Checking on a meter to see if one of them thru with, 
All of 'em get to moving so you moving, 
Swindling a store like swindling an award, 
I'm, more Issa Rae, if we're sorta the same Ima support, 
And carry all of that with me to the door,  
Like carrying last names, 
Or carrying a pistol for the minute that bag came, 
And opening the bag to see it's nothing that bag claimed, 
And carrying the calling of them seeing their last days, 
Unless that bag change, 
Or carrying honor like you carried a stance 
Or being asked by your neighbors if you can carry your man 
With 5 others, don't nothing surprise none of us, 
So whoever surprised would kill to come outside and live beside one of us, Til it come to the numbers, 
And one of those 5 get called to jump up inside 
That pine and you get to running, like fuck it, 
It's prolly safest to just live it off a playlist 
And tell us how it provided inspiration 
I’m inspired by knowing that pots really work, 
Shots really turn a starter into a martyr if the top send a word, 
And word be in the air like picturing what you heard, 
And know whoever's looking is listening to it first, you heard?

Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 
Call it heirlooms and accessories, 
And peep how they all hang so pleasantly,   
Now go pass that to who you love, 
And tell ‘em to treat that like weaponry, for real 

Consider what just occurred, 
All that could be got and the feelings that could emerge, 
And they said that they get it but to see what it be worth 
Is asking for them to see off of the curb, 
‘cause they saw it but all of them told me they got it from here, 
Long as they're dealing with product in here, 
Know the whole line up is bout it in here, 
Won't no one ever have problems in here, 
All of these baggies they got up in here?, 
Fuck could they ever be worried about?, 
Snipers is on, swipers is on, 
Shit is like they never heard of a drought, for real, 
Like ""what the lick read?, we just want everything lit B, 
As long as you kick it at this speed, we can relate to all this G’s, 
Trapping up out of an M3, light work til the Range come, 
We be out here with the right work, light work, shit is A1”, 
And so, I heard it all and replied, I bet you I know it too well, 
Catching a lick is a high, you just gotta know when you fell, 
Fell into a bag that you can flip into a couple more, 
Now you in your bag and shit is hitting like you fucking thought, 
""He said that's just what I mean"", and he got to popping a zan, 
He got a spot up in reach, he said he got him a plan
Plan goes, ""anything goes when opportunity knocks, 
Fam knows, we gonn' let it go, do what you do if it pops!"", 
They get to spotting the vics, Balenciaga's is lit, 
They in the spot with the stick, like ""ayo they got it to give, 
So ayo they gotta get got"", they get to rolling and rocking the spot, 
Do it and get in and out with the grips, 
Neighbors is watching the property drop, 
Snaps is litty, mixing the Dusse with Henny, 
Hammers tucked under the Fendi, neighborhood know you get busy, 
But that neighborhood ain't a gimmie, it ain't been yours in a while tho, 
Same custi's on citibike's is pointing out pictures with 5-0, 
And all of the change that you saw 
That you igged cause you thought 
Would never change how you're on, is everything you knew par, 
It's everything they shoot for, based on what you’re here for, 
They never could've been more right if your type is to hear wrong, 
Heirlooms and accessories, all hang so pleasantly  
Pass that to who you love, treat that like weaponry",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-heirlooms-and-accessories-lyrics
Rocket Science,The Great Debater,2012.0,"Labeled me different from the jump
When all I was here to do was jump in
Outcast for not knowing what dumb is
They say I'm OutKast with a corner store run in
I listen to 3 Stacks and hope I'm what he fuck with
I know I'm what he fuck with, never mind hoping
Cause dope knows dope so as far as what the dope is
It gets familiar, the memory stays
No matter the time, no memory's vague
So every memory saved
Is recognition of the first time dipping
It feel like the reason you started penning
And I'm from the home of the skid marks, the Popeye big arms
So me being the raw is all I was built for
Growing in your attention while mine is growing hallow
As I type this verse, I'm BBMing a model
Or better yet, she BBMing me
Sending me pictures of all that she wanna give to me
Everything from after the shower to Louis Vuitton receipts
Saying its a gift, and a gift whenever we meet
And I'm trying to finish this record, but believe me
She look like everything I expected, so I be knee deep
ASAP, the beat on playback, I still got more to say
And she can't change that, and I can't break that
As broke as the rest be
Swear what I write is all the shit that they left me

I swear it's not rocket science (x3)
I just tell em what my day is
And they alike so they replay it
I swear it's not rocket science (x3)
I just tell em what my day like
And they alike so they know the date right

Never preached on a record, I just said what it be on a record
And made em wanna believe on a record, anytime it's me on a record
I par the bars and don't give em room to breathe on a record
They saying that my ingenuity was designed for you to be
So I be backpedaling going from you to me
I'm still trying to believe in a hero
But I keep aiming for where they be from the get-go
And maybe mine alone, died alone, my hands was by the phone
Like when Omar popped Brother Mouzone by the scroll
And called like come get em, I'm all but done with em
I was often who you loved when Paul was running with em
Apologies, whatever it gotta be
Pay that cost, and hope yall on the side of me
And may that cost be no more than a proper fee
Talking the influx, kidding you gotta be
Shit is just outta me,I right my 24
They say it's complicated but them hours is for the call
Tell em I'm a 95 Nike ad, half cent dog
Got all type of swag, double D Tyra with a wifey tag
Telling me the past is the past in the past frame
Bitches be having babies over night, like what's your last name?
Promise me you'll know it if it's ever you
And not walk around thinking tumor's got the best of you


I swear it's not rocket science, they think I'm probably lying
If you forever been a fan, they say you probably biased
I forever been the stamp of a higher climbing
And they won't let you get a hand if you tryna find it
But I'm in a room full of chargers
Typing out my life for the starters
And ever pair of sneakers is a part of it
Contemplating becoming a martyr
And if I'll even know it if it happens so regardless
I swear it's not rocket science...not at all",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-rocket-science-lyrics
Steel’s Apartment,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Sex money and murder
All the decorations they set up under the curtains
They sitting here singing they never wanted to hurt us
And never would they ever
So I guess they made good on they're promises all together
But maybe they really didn't
Meaning they really did get to semi auto lifting
Ricochet reasons when they ricochet rabbit us
Trick bullets that'll stop mid air and mallet us
We just tryna duck it but they bucking like if practice was
Targeted to here, 
out the window with this view
From this apartment with a stare
That'll make you wanna see more
All of this intrigue will make you leave from outta these doors
And look for where Quiles is
Bigger dreams penciled in, hennessy adrenaline
Throw down, stand up and die for it like blizzard did
40 ounces on 40 degree days
Penning 40 bar verses wit 40 on each page
And writing around the holes
I'm running outta room when I'm writing so I suppose
My pose is more in depth
My pose along the steps is home so to the death
We was built to play the right and I chose to bust a left

Dedicated to better living
Spending on better women
Took it and ran wit when they said we better get it
Like we was doing good but we doing better winning
And knowing there could be no better ending
And its dedicated to never living
Spending but never getting
Took it to stand wit it when they said we'll never get it
Like we misunderstood them wanting to never switch it
And knowing that this shit is never ending, and looking back on it
It all started in Steel's apartment

One in the same if there's something to say
Something to say like I was still just the one to remain
One to remain like I was dealing wit one in the cham'
One in the cham' like the feeling there is nothing to gain
Nothing to gain like I'm wheeling in to jump in that lane
Jump in that lane like revealing I was one in the same
It circles back, and we just tryna jump in that ring
Jump in that ring like if we won't get to jump in again
I mean, like, all we wanted was opportunity
And even if we couldn't be exact, we knew the means
Even if we couldn't see a stack we was true to dream
And even when we got to be in that we never knew to eat
Fucking something or at least we was pursuing it
And ordering lobster fried rice if we was doing it, ha!
Young and wide eyed, sprung off of Diddy crew
Like 
word to Puff wait til we get in these living rooms
Or better yet I, cuz I was all alone in a basement full of eyes
That was similar to mine, wit no similar in rhyme
None similar to mine, and we kicking it like shit is live or die


Cause we once a crew of youngin's of the same kind
Quick to holla up at something with the same line
Never changed so if we out then ima still roll
And let the feeling remind us until the feeling's gone",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-steels-apartment-lyrics
The Stick-Up Tape from Menace,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"The star of the story we love so well, well enough to repeat, imitation's flattery and everything it precedes,
 
Imitation happens to be everything we believe, and everything we see leave, 
But leaving doesn't come with us so never would we leave, 
So if there's ever a moment you do see leave, 
Then it was live or die, it fit you like a reply, 
And then all of the attention is with you until you blind, 
And then all that you was given was written for you to find, 
As true as the religion concealing your .45
, 
.45's and gauges, Macs in fact, it switch places, act for act, 
It switch stages or switch pages it gets make shift and gets taken, 
It gets layman's then gets sacred, 
It's a complicated turn of a events with lights over it, 
And based on any further intent, you might notice it, 
Like, intent on being noticed for what you been on, 
And what you stood on being the motto that you live on, 
'cause what you stood on came from the crate you would sit on, 
And you would look on and see how you was 'sposed to get on, 
And when you get on, you put on where the attention at, 
And know that looking on is to listen back, and getting back 
Everything you did it for, bright as what you living for, 
Promise it would never turn dim at all 

And all it took to come to life was a stage to live it, 
Shit can happen overnight if you're awake to get it, 
Like aiming before you draw and what it takes to hit it, 
Or Caine and O-Dog, the stick up tape from menace 
Before you leave, make sure you leave with it 

It's like knowing where the cameras in the walls are, 
And they were already talking for you before the talk starts, 
And your direction comes into question like it was On Star,
 
It's either turn it on for the tape or turn into wall art, 
Or maybe you was there but you really wasn't, 
In the cut, but before it cut you can feel it coming, 
Quicker than you ever could've thought without interrupting, 
Bottle on the floor and now you wishing you didn't touch it, 
Empty the cash register out 'fore you get to running, 
Now there's a motive on top of that tape rolling 
On top of that other motive that same tape ain't notice,
 
It's all context, but get all that acclaim and you'll get to love it, 
It starts as a flash, it grows into fluorescence, 
It goes into an essence that poses when you press it, like the tape do, 
It dares you to mimic it like ""son what your aim do?”, 
And however you fit in that light is how it takes you, 
Like, word to a shooter's touch, steady as ever like you shooting up, 
Brighter than ever, you ain't losing much, 
And validation is everything that you knew it was, 
You finger prints on a bottle but that ain't proving much, 
For the importance of needing importance, 
Until its loud enough where somebody's seeing you for it, 
And calling for everything you did it for, as dull as what you living for, 
Promised it would never turn dim at all  

And all it took to come to life was a stage to live it, 
Shit can happen overnight if you're awake to get it, 
Like aiming before you draw and what it takes to hit it, 
Or Caine and O-Dog, the stick up tape from menace 
Before you leave, make sure you leave with it 

Leave with enough time for them to forget what they heard, 
But still enough time for you to spread that word, 
Word is that words don’t be enough 
But certain words be worth speaking up, 
Up over how we think they know us, 
Still up under where they hold us, 
Eye level with what they showed us but, 
Still up, all up with “they”, but “they” who?, 
“they” me or “they” you?, 
'cause “they” see what “they” do 
And “they” mean what “they” drew 
But “they” keeping “they” cool, and, 
They need you to be you, so go ‘head, be you, 
But know that that tape's on 
And you might not be able to take shorty to the back like 
“bitch that tape ain’t yours, hand that over so me and my man can break north”, 
Still up, and still us, all for validation 
Because they told us we wasn’t valid, 
Told us we ain’t matter so, now we matter right?, 
Matter to us, matter to you, matter to they, 
It matters what we say and what we portray 
But what matters is what we became, 
All for “they”, so for better and worse 
Make sure they spread that around, 
Cause all it took to come to life was a stage to live it, 
Shit can happen overnight if you're awake to get it, 
Like aiming before you draw and what it takes to hit it, 
Or Caine and O-Dog, the stick up tape from menace 
Before you leave, make sure you leave with it",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-stick-up-tape-from-menace-lyrics
Love Is Love,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"Love me like fighting thru yellow tape, 
'til you find that the face ain't mine and it set you straight, 
But you find that the face was in line with your other name, 
So you repast, front of the line to get a plate, 
Or love me like a purchase on 47th and 6th, 
And the Russian jeweler knock off $100 off what you pick, 
In the middle of February your sleeves up off your wrist, 
And you add another $100 when discussing what you spent, 
And the discussion hit a switch 
And it turns to where you tucking your wrist, 
Or you get to untucking your suspense, 
And all the suspense of it leads to adrenaline running 
And it's orchestrated all from the other side of the fence, 
And then love me like that side of the fence love bottom lines, 
While their kids call their friends kids and they holla ""slime”, 
And they don't get the gist but they get what it can provide, 
And they still don't know how to pronounce ""collards"" but it's fine, 
Love me for not assuming that you see me and assume 
I'm pursuing how you see me tryna lead you out your gloom, 
Or maybe you assume that you see me in the scenery you knew, 
And I ain't never did a scene but it's cool, right?, 
Love me for overlooking what I ain't have to, 
Chose you when you didn't choose you when you had to, 
Pretend it never happened if mine should ever ask you, 
Wouldn't take much to revert to what your past knew 
Love me like Harlem loves Pan Pan's memory, 
Standing on display off of hand to hand symmetry, 
Cameras get in play while you handle what the ticket be, 
And candles on the way if you ain't handing out dinner seats, 
So love me like I introduced you Dominicans, 
Whether it was Ayisha Diaz or her kin and them, 
Talking bout a price and what it's worth to be the middleman, 
Fitted for a crown and how it works and the expense of it, 
Love me like the drummer, love me like never running outta runners, 
Love me like what we sung before they hung us, 
Hymn's getting lost in the clouds when they was flung up, 
Or shells getting caught in the crowd by the wrong “others”, 
Like, other than you, and other than him, 
Until they learn those exceptions turn to others with them, right?, 
Or, otherwise shooting for the other side, 
'til they box you without a trial on a 1-5, 
And then love me like you was Venida Browder, 
Pickets outside and you just tryna ease the crowd up, 
Knowing your heart died makes your heart beat louder, 
Until the speakers blow and it lift you up from around us
Love me like we-loved the legacy that her youngest would become, 
And the illusion of no reruns, 
Love me like turning down a plea when you need one, 
But knowing that your word is worth more than what a plea does, 
Love me like getting pussy off a DM, 
The turn around time at her door before the week ends, 
Caution she ain't throw out before, but now she in, 
And her heart beat sitting at the door that let you leap in
Love me like pictures on the wall not resembling 
You so them pictures on the wall start trembling 
And you got pictures for the wall that can fit on it 
But dude start thinking bout his wall and that's the end of it, 
Love me like '88 3s, Nike Air heels, 
Dropping $220 will take away how fear feels
I'm $700 first day, word to the steering wheel, 
Kites for who bleeding but this a hype we believe in 
Love me like not understanding the hype of it, 
But you love it so there ain't no one else who might love it, 
Or loving it since you understand cause you was there, 
When it was misunderstood at $100 a pair, yeah, 
Love me like the moment that the jakes leave, 
Knowing that's another 24 with no the state greens, 
My man said his aim dirty but his name clean, 
Tried to tell his mother the difference before the day leave, 
Told her love him for every chain that he wore, 
Every serial number scratched, every tre in the drawer, 
Every feeling she ever had where she awakes to a call 
That he's gone, it never happened so don't blame the allure
Love me like Jada love Sheek love Styles 
Love LOX lovers all geeking thru the crowd, 
Love me like me at 14 geeking out, 
Or 20 years later still screaming who it's bout, 
Love me like a J dub's dedication, 
Following their lead 'cause they seem to have better patience, 
You fear what you don't understand or levitate with, 
I say that with a pint in my hand, that's regulation 
Love me like my son on the way when I see his charm, 
And by the time you hear this he'll be in my arms, 
Same arms forever here where he belongs, 
Is the same arms that Ima bare if you mean him harm
Love me like all of the above in a bag, 
Singing ""fuck 'em all!"" when you in love with a stash, 
Or singing ""fuck 'em all!"" when you in love with a flag 
That takes what you want, or loves what you had, love is love",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-love-is-love-lyrics
Stop Fooling Yourself,Cloud 9: The 3 Day High,2006.0,"Feels somethin' like
I solemnly swear what I perform in the booth, all of it is truth
I solemnly swear what I perform in the booth, all of it is truth
I solemnly swear, what I perform in the booth, all of it is truth
Goes somethin like this

Uh, to whoever it may concern
If you listenin', I'm lookin' for a place to turn
See it seems like, this is all I want out of life
But it's the other way around, I wanna do right
But it's moreso a question of responsibilities
So the lights stay on, but my conscience is killin' me
Gettin' my Mariano on, pitcher perfect
Still inside, I fear the Lord like ""is it worth it?""
Huh, at first I say ""no""
But when I open my closet, it makes say so - fuck it
And this is hustler haven, see I'm not alone
Cause he would say that I got faith, or I got a home
So I ask God if he still love us
I don't always wanna be this drug dealin' ma'fucker but
I was playin' on, with opposite plans
And I ain't even have the decency to wash my hands

So he spoke through the clouds like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
I said nevermind the mistakes, and he said
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
I said I'm tryin' to get through them gates, and he said
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
I said I'm tryin' to switch my ways, and he said
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)

Searchin' for a way out of the bottom
Without shootin' the 3, or tryin' to serve product
I'm really just tryin' ta defy the odds
A 9 to 5 is callin' me, but I'm tryin' ta dodge
I really wanna do the school thing
The so called not cool thing
Cause I'm gettin' tired of movin' things
So maybe Howard or Morehouse or Clark-Atlanta
But all of my friends peddle crack and spark hammers
I told em we could still be hood and do somethin' more
Wit our lives
And they all look surprised like
""Wasn't you the same ma'fucker
That showed us how to cook up and cut the butter?""
I said ""Yeah, but I guess I sort of had an epiphany""
""I'm tryin' to take this ride, and ya'll don't wanna trip wit me?""
Got into NC Central and I was glad
I ripped my acceptance letter in half

Cause my dudes kept tellin' me
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
Tried to change my grind and they replied
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
I said ""you changed wit time,"" and they was dyin' like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
So I changed my mind and stayed outside like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)

They say you are what you are, and you been what you been
Played the corner so long, I blend with the wind
Mind over matter
Money from the grind is a factor
Tryin' to get it wit mines gon' matter
You are what you are, and you been what you been
Played the corner so long, I blend with the wind
Mind over matter
Money from the grind is a factor
Tryin' to get it wit mines gon' matter

Cause everything else is really like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
I'm playin' tug 'o war wit myself like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
Cause if I try to call for some help it's like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)
Scared to go to the Lord for help like
(Boy, stop foolin yourself
Boy, stop)

So I just say fuck it
I solemnly swear what I perform in the booth, all of it is truth
I solemnly swear what I perform in the booth, all of it is truth
I solemnly swear what I perform in the booth, all of it is truth

The Rage of Roemello,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"The rage of Roemello
My name tryna echo
Staring so long I swear the page saying hello
I'm hearing these songs but tryna change up the metro
It feel like he'ron the way I'm straining wit the let go
The rage of it all, I swear to God

Wrote it to make you call me dope man, dope man
Got y'all in tune but that tune got me moved so if I choose to let this go and
Bid this shit adieu, and your listening improves
At least there's packages left if you living in that mood
See we attract to the stretch, everything should flip in twos
And if not, we should stop, like we did all we could do
So I'm on my gracefully bow, and on my way to that bow
I leave it up to you to perform my grace for me now
I mean, hands folded, maybe the plans folded
Wasn't supposed to love it, they say that you can't show it
I mean, easier spoken of, see where this goes for us
Say its real or at least hope that the motive was
Never had a second thought, never asked, never once
Knee deep in it, fuck it, we ain't leaving it
Until it all goes and we go to get to reach for it
And shit is smoke and mirrors and we swinging tryna see through it
Stick and move, I'm liable to switch & shoot
Like I ain't here to play with this fog, let's get this through
And I ain't here to stay with these odds, so when in tune
I'm either tryna even these odds or hit a new
As far as I can remember, we'd idolize thru the winter
And rather be in the 4 like when Stoudemire's at center
I mean, GS 400's is all we wanted
However we do it, long as we done it, the rage of Roemello

Listening to Gloria's youngest, had us all in the running
To wanna be what they told us we wasn't
Like all we need is to kno if we running, its not in place
Cuz ambition is by the day, word to Wale
I mean, same scenery we was tryna believe to be
Had us counting wins before we had us an in
And sleeping is paper thin, no wonder why we don't do it much
Sheets barely used, tell em all of this is new to us, right?
And every dream that I dream is littered
With the fiends that I done seen while tryna leave these visions
And so to clear it, I wrote to wanna be like him wit it
I hope he hear it, cuz word to 
Chi Ali we did it
I hope he hear it, word to this blue Yank'
100 grey bottoms, these shits never lose rank
And agreeing that heavy is the fade under it, but for the love of it
They look to you to carry it and everything its bundled with
Sunrise open your eyes, no surprise
Made it off of living for doe or die
Now you in the back of the coupe, glaring, half of the stoop staring
To the point where you can give away packs like Snoop Pearson
Think about it, yea, THAT kinda rich
Sing songs for black hoodies and black violins, I mean
The swan song for the evening
Forgive me in advance for your grievings, the rage of Roemello",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-rage-of-roemello-lyrics
Finesse Everything,Peddler Themes,2017.0,"I sip the henny white, listen and write and share knowledge
And pour more cause I got a case in the spare closet
My talk walks all thru the tape of who sharing product
44s all on they waist, they here wilding
Their corridors turned to a range with spare mileage
The speakers in the door upgrade, you hear the pockets
Alhamdulillah all in my tape, I talk Godish
But still talk bitches and Bape and support thotting
Contradictions, and grew up with a couple pots to piss in
My parents was split so I was drifting
You drift to whatever you seen before, I drift over letters like Ouija boards
You thinking hasbro I'm thinking the back door, boarded when the fear come
And chris and snoop with a nail gun
Fear none, hear none worth fear being involved
They fear me like I'm Sheila Salaam
Seen it all, I mean, thank God for bank cards and crash readers
Knick game, all black sneakers
Yellow chain, floor seats, cameras on me and Bay Frazier
My Jordan 3s might break up a lay up
Still flourish like I'm starving, shuttlesworth stardom
I'm usually in the garden I ain't too hard to find
And know whenever you carving mine
A double entendre's a two part rewind, bet I finesse everything

Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything
Bet I finesse everything

(Who's world is this?)
Don't matter I can finesse it
'cause if they can't answer you that they outta the question
And if they can't hand you it back stop suggesting
Either that or they can get back to finding the exit
Sitting in the front of the plane
Ghostwriting for pick a name and another name, one in the same
And my OGs would give us jewelry under their rap sheet
And me and my wisdom blow jewelry money in patsys
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit troop
But it don't break thru to you until that pay shoot thru
'cause know that if I wasn't writing it for them you seen em sketch me
If I tell it then y'all bet it, I'm Ian Begley
Rap shit started at 9 on class walks
And now it's me and another 9 on the blackboard, ask for him
He can rhyme his ass off, he can rhyme off his ass
And Lex Steele it how he slide in the stash
Meanwhile me and A' debating on 
early Nas
And talking 'bout how we first linked like calling cards
Back when he called me over off the gold on my Nikes
Regretted letting me play, my crossover was nice
Chicken wings, fried rice like I'm still 16
And I don't get called for features cause I kill 16s
That's word to my man Joell, this rap shit's a bunch of ""oh wells""
Fuck whatever I don't sell, bet I finesse everything",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-finesse-everything-lyrics
The Opener,The Salvation,2009.0,"Jesus is the savior, tell him what you want
Call him on the main line, tell him what you want
Jesus is the savior, tell him what you want
What you want, what you want, what you want
If you want salvation, tell him what you want
Call him on the main line, tell him what you want
If you want salvation, tell him what you want
What you want, what you want, what you want

Twenty-four/seven, three sixty-five
Twenty-five years, embedded in these lines
If I push the pen past the margin on the side
You can feel the words and every part of 'em is I
Twenty-four/seven, three sixty-five
Twenty-five years, embedded in these lines
If I push the pen past the margin on the side
You can feel the words and every part of 'em is I
(Salvation)

So I push it to the far right
The bare minimum, overseein the far sight
I'm clear into 'em, no belief in the far height
Conversatin' with Lucifer under God's light
Low when I'm kickin it, caught myself whisperin
Coverin my mouth, so if you look you can't figure it
Knowin that he read it but I still be pretendin it
Knowin I regret it but I still put my fist in it
Waited on a long run
From the same places that they all from
First name basis with the wrong one
Still by the end of it, I back and forth wonder who be listenin
I don't second guess it, I'm just visionin
Pardon my inquisitive
Saw the other hand and wanted the upper hand but ain't agree with the grip on it
You see the hardest thing I ever had to do
Was determine what I could and what I couldn't tell to you
If it's worth it, then I'm good and I'm good to get it through
But if it's not, then I'm just workin to pursue a pedestal
And off top, I could show 'em the end reel
It's hard to really chill or sit still
Commit to the page
I write a rhyme, sometimes I won't finish for days
Cause before I get to finish, all the imagery change
But the game is the same along with the Bodeg'
Next to the liquor store where all of the hope lays
I mean, the Arthur Agees could bypass the baggies
But the common goal is drop hoops in broad day
So you play the hallway, with your heart on your sleeve
And the walls is like a car to the beat, follow leads
I mean, the temp got you walkin before you get up
And the wrath of it'll put you anywhere that you want
You see from behind the crowd
And even your dreams get to see from behind the clouds
But speakin is not allowed
Mama said peace when she see that you out of bounds
Her sight's good but her believin is by the ground
And so she kneeled down, hands folded in unison
Her cares in the air, tryin to follow the truth in it
+Tears For Fears+ and +The World+ He +Rulin+ In
Burner under the pillow, you don't sleep if you usin it
I call it like I see it
And if ever the call fails, I redial, call and hope you receive it
By unanimous decision, all of 'em's tellin me
That it's me that could paint true Brooklyn like Shelton Lee
I ain't aim to make a classic, I aim to state what happens
And if the outcome gets praised, then blame the havoc
If the outcome gets praised, then blame the tragic
Cause everything I pen is a mirror of your reactions
And everywhere I've been is mirrored within the absence
Where they four five through the static
They say that the habits is head strong
And the more that it's pressed on
The deeper you indulge and I could be dead wrong
But if I end up gettin any of this right
There shouldn't be anything left to write, right? So",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-opener-lyrics
Could’ve Struck The Lotto,The Great Debater,2011.0,"Killin' your idols one word at a time
When I was killin y'alls, I was also murderin' mine
Indeed I'm all it be, I squeeze accordingly
If a fave should get caught in between then all it means
Is meaning was never enough for me to wanna wish through
Fists full of dollars, ignorance is so blissful
Every part of me just wanna see how much the fists do
If this be a problem then I'm missing all the signals
You could miss me with the mistakes
Cause my realities is the meaning of missed plates
Kitchen tables need decorating, I'm decorated
The china be there but all the feelings is misplaced
And this may lead to a decay of beautiful sorts
If I could race through all the traits and the beautiful Porsche
Then I'll erase through the change they refuse to restore
And pitfalls in the poetry, truthfully yours
And monologues at a dollar store, invited to ride along
Parental advisory, all of it is how you thought
All that we In Search Of is to Fly Or Die
So to have you Seeing Sounds that's inside the Sky
Is Nothing I suppose, so if I was alone
Then them sounds that you seeing is all that I really know

For the all in the mall
And the rush to follow
That buck that bought a bottle
Could've struck the lotto
Say I'm on what I'm on trying to jump tomorrow
And I bought that boy a bottle
Could've struck the lotto, honestly

So that's 300 tickets that we could be comin' in with
That spade shit is pricey but we in love with the livin'
We in love with the life, lust, the pursuit
Promise not to forget how to adjust to the stoop
But if I'm away from whatever is made from
Know that I betrayed none, forever remained one
Forever embedded in the better of days come
The header on page one, my sketch is 
a ? run
Tootin' my own horn'll level the page some
And then the level gets lowered and I refrain from
Pennin' what the norm does, everything the norm was
Should've been the past but the future's like the norm's son
Tryna plan B that, pills in the sauce
Hope they smart enough to eat that and dumb enough to starve
So to summarize it all, this is more than what it seems
Fully loaded clouds, corner of your dreams
It's nothing I suppose, so if I was alone
Then them sounds that you seeing is all that I really know",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-couldve-struck-the-lotto-lyrics
Forever in a Day,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"Infinitely caught in a weave of, 
Tryna dip around what they breed before you leave or, 
Climbing in and out of a scene they call elite or, 
Lining up whoever's between the world and me or, 
Me and the world, whichever first when pronouncing it, 
Taught us ""get enough for us all if you come out with it"", 
The background eat till it's gone if you all around with it, 
Tryna get a piece off the corner like quarter ouncing it, 
Caught up in the bounce of it, where loyalty is all that it oughta’ be
Like if I was to call and see if you down for it, 
Word to a dresser drawer burying what was found in it, 
Truly forever yours ever more if you doubted it, 
Ever more like more than you was ever surrounded with, 
To get involved makes you apart of the sound of it, 
No regret at the door and no announcing it, 
Fucking with whatever you about with it

Forever in a day

Forever ever, forever ever, 
With short change measures, in all day leathers, 
And honor's like forever ever, forever ever, 
Your alibi know to keep it Andre clever, 
And being on mean we ignored what all they left us, 
And it starts out being as on as Rae Sremmurd, 
Bare minimum, the feeling of ceilings that never left us, 
But the chicken box will kick off the top for whatever weather, 
For the win of it, corner get loud, they caught wind of it, 
And everybody caught in the sound that you was whispering, 
Send something flying around to help them get in it, 
Or how that's still yours if your name ain't on the end of it, 
Loyalty is priceless, jewelry isn't, 
Give or take, depending on what type of jewelry you're given, 
In a space, where the script is stuck to like a pivot, 
If you knew us then you knew we was with it when it’s 
Forever in a day 

Forever in a day, forever in a day, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, and never will it stray, 
100 on the line, however we should aim
Forever in a day

Broad day like jumping out in the way 
When one is jumping up outta the front and finding it's aim, 
Or, divying a bag with who you're beside every day 
And splitting points like you dotted your name, 
'cause know that all of these green lives that used to be here, 
Matter like these black lives that these blue lives shoot outta fear, 
So all these green lives used over here, 
Was 'posed to set it where never would a second set of shooters appear, 
The first set is just the usual here, 
It makes sense as much as it kinda don't but that's new to who, where?, 
The prestige, of feeling like you're who they let breathe, 
Due to a bag that you shouldn't have, it just seems, 
Like more than they’re letting on to, 
Finger fucking money resorts to thinking that it adores you, 
Whatever you make of it, make it where it goes around with you, 
In light of where all these go arounds put you, forever in a day",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-forever-in-a-day-lyrics
The Definitive Prayer,The Great Debater,2011.0,"As soon as the drum rolls I’m picturing unloads
I’m picturing one show that gives them an unclosed
Description of one grown, and witnessing son grown
“That boy good, and to the greats, he the one chose”
As soon as the horns lift, I picture the cautious
Becoming beyond it from fear of the lost sense
I’m picturing all them that said he was awesome
Retracting their talking for fear an endorsement
May seal up their coffin, hammer to the nail
Metal to metal but he’s just planning to prevail
Ghetto to ghetto they say he handle what they rail
Echo the echoes, and if he handle what they rail
He’s never been settled so if your handling is frail
He let go the legos and tell you “catch ‘em if you will”
You catch like D-Will, well and good, have you riding for your team
Until you find out you traded off the bottom of your screen
Like “let me find out”, gave it every line of what I be
Until the time’s out, and this shit is just not what it should be
So every Glock that ever leans and every shot that ever leaves
From off the top of where that beam is red dotting where you breathe
Is in a box apparently waiting out to hear from me
They wait aloud to hear the screams and they about whatever needs
And their hearing’s well and good so if they think they heard a call
They tryna hop outta that box and make you sing the words along
Serenades warrant hearing aids, ringing murder ones
Blue and whites move alike if they should think they heard a drum
And they justifying justice, pulling triggers for the cause
I got a big enough applause off the strength of the allure
Saying this is what it was, 
well if this is what becomes
Then I became what they paint as the picture never hung
I became what they made as a glimpse of what was won
The W’s at The W, spilling off the hum
The one to do what they wanna do, in it for the run
’Til the tape’s broke in half and I’m praised off of laps
Call it A-side B-side, tape broke in half
And my A-side B-side was made to be exact
No 40 dollar replicas but all of my etcetera’s
Exemplified the inner sides of all that my forever does
Live or die, get us by, bigger signs, better runs
Bigger rides, get inside, visualize what never comes
Minimized inner highs, Phyllis Hy’, level one
Staring at a page and a pill with a heavy tongue
Say that I amaze but I still feel forever young
Heavy is the fade that should fill that New Era son
Imagine it in front of you, like packages that wanna move
So much so that they react without you running to
So running towards is all that you in it for
All the stones in that crown is all that it really was
All them stones on the ground is all that you penning off
From the pitching to the ditching, its more than they get to pump
So chorus them for the trunk, meaning sing for the drive
I’m still the peddlers theme, they say I sing for the drive
Now bring in the reprise, and let the beat breathe
I’ll let you comb through the poem and what’s beneath these
I’m on my throne, Pewter Foams 
and the seat reads
That “you should know you alone is what the need needs”
So on the low I know the code & how to debrief
But on the low I know the dough is where belief be
So all of my encouragement is pointed on hurrying
’Cause getting it don’t mean that you got it, so we gonn’ hurry this
And get it until each of us got it, you say you listening
I hope that when I speak in these pockets you get the gist of it
They open off of me in them boxes where they be signaling
Like “we see them a block away, so put all of that stock away!”
I come through, windows off, still knocking Rae’
The Hilfiger version, and I feel I’m in its purpose
So I wheeled ‘em where the words is, pedal to the predicate
For the love of money baby, decimals is delicate
For the love of money baby, settling we never did
They can’t fuck with where this effort is
See if I told you everything I ever wanted to say
You’d either nobel prize me or scurry away
And that nobel prize seat?, I’m one up away
“A Dream Deferred” will chauffeur me to one of them thangs
Either a plaque or a stat or a ribbon that’s attached
To a gold plated Alfred, in-scripted through the back
Homey this shit is a wrap, if you was bitching in the past
The future is more looted, baby get it how you ask
The truest to walk through it, so whoever yall spewing
To be that guy back slides, I fountain pen baptize
The same shit that I was with, I’m still in that mind
So never mind who on that side",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-definitive-prayer-lyrics

To my other half or what used to be, what I used to know
How it used to seem and however it used to go
Never foresaw change as an all and all
But now I'm all for change, baby call this off (if you see me)
See my intentions were good with tryin to be in this
But I tried seein it and couldn't find me in it
And I was IDin it, lookin for a reason to fall back
But still daydreamin of call backs (if you see me)
I guess it was denial, I gave up the fight
Hopin you could downplay the down plays of my life
I sang ""job well done"", holdin banners in the stands
'Til you switched, now when I think of handin you a hand (if you see me)
I get, a little less enthused
Cause everything should be the same if we've been true
But everything is rearranged and I'm lookin for a light switch

And criticize the chances that you don't ever get
So from the outside scopin in
They look towards you to provide the hope for them (if you see me)
And they bein your friends, hate me yet again
But it's cool, cause none of them made me in the end
But as for you, I put you on a higher plane
So high it made it easier to fly away (if you see me)
See I ain't use no one opinion about you to out you
Never entertained a reason to ever doubt you
But leave it up to you to play follow along
They mad cause they don't have and you droppin it off (if you see me)
And the same ones callin you, sayin what you ought to do
Wasn't tryin to help you with everything that you thought you knew

I spent more time replyin instead of tryin
But could've spend half of that time and stopped lyin
Lyin to myself and tellin me what I wanna hear
Hopin it could erase the shit I've done in there (if you see me)
Heartbeat, runnin scared, outside, freezer box

Missed calls replaced the rose petal covered floors (if you see me)

Say nobody did it closer they was climbing from below him
And they clocking where I'm throwing like I got it for the lower
Turn this room into a lobby like I got this wide and open, ha!
Bottom line is give and go, riding high, ceiling low
Can't nobody dub it so I'm five alive kicking flows
Call me top five, live and die by the shit I wrote
Bitches swinging by like let me ride or let me live alone
Fitteds on my off day, basements is all grey
Louis pouch toothpicks, 
quotables is Andre
Wrote about the hall way, flow is in and out
If they speaking on my sneakers then they foaming at the mouth
Say I did it for the borough, how we looking?, how we looking?
Ain't no dancing in that kitchen, if they cooking then they cooking
Say they handle how you get it wit no looking when you looking
Tell em hands is out the window when I'm pushing what I'm pushing

On it like a replay
Run this like a relay
Do it for where we stay
We be on that give it up
Made it looking easy
Promise when you see me (may)
Do it for where we stay
We be on that give it up
Shorty know how we play
Took that over easy
Do it for where we stay
We be on that give it up
Do it for where we stay
We be on that give it up
We be on that give it up
We be on that give it up

Day to day we on it, my day to days is flawless
When they was waiting for Jordans I vacay'ed wit Jordan
My gateway was retarded, G4's is 10 a go
Google me and 5 world series show, really though
Clearly though, hennessy and spade is all we cheering fo'
Long as A is wit me I'll be in here til they clear the flo'
Playing now or never wit whoever got her clear to blow
There we go, know your way around like you been here befo'
Too much of a better thing but said that if we got it
We would do it up for everything and never be without it
We would do it how they never did and bet you if you doubt it
That we true enough to rep it and forever be about it, ha!
Bout it like a Miller
, bout it bout it like for realla
Went spurs wit the ace & poured a bottle out for Dilla
How they serving off this tray, know we out here full of winners
Got her slurred off the base, like this bottom bout to kill her


And I'm in, new sneakers, few divas, wit 2 seaters
Cuz swag attracts swag, believe us
Back track when you see us
Money talks in echoes, 
never feared the moment
I'm more so on my Melo

Or more so Gapetto, flying everywhere
Tear a lining in the air, dump the guts from my 'Rello
It's Dj Prince, make your girl hit falsettos
Dreaming to be on my team, I told her hell no

Double R my L-O, monogram where the loops at, living for whatever
Its whatever to recoup that, guessing that you knew that
On it from the jump
Said I'm fly enough to look like I just tossed 'em out the trunk

And you call it what you want, cause all we do is live it up
Signature style what we bringing 'bruh, give it up

Fly guy etiquette, ride by repping it

Hoodie SZN,In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"All black draping, drawstrings hanging, 
Bet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, 
Bet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, 
Everything it does for me is all in correlation 
Of me draping that up over me and keeping what it came with, 
Know they're hand in hand and ain’t no way to separate it, 
Ain’t no room for separation, only room to fit inside it, 
Room enough to be who they assume you coincide with, 
Like pulling on the drawstrings and running up inside of 
Where it’s at like “where it at?!” and leaving out with that beside us, 
Or pulling on the drawstrings to run from who behind us 
Til we happen to be back to where we had to need reminding, 
Remind us of the shit you was taught and still agree with, 
And how you can’t forget what you thought but never seen it, 
And if you did see what you thought, you couldn’t leave it, 
It turned everything that you saw into a sequence, 
Similar but different and all like it’s a remix, 
But bet you that hoodie is with me through any season, 
Bet it holds me over if somebody's rolling over 
Saying that I look familiar but they needed to see me closer, 
Bet you that it got me if they got me in they’re line 
With an infrared light show following behind, 
Bet you it got me covered if we talking about coverage 
And debating on the light that should be thrown up at the subject 
If the light that was behind me carried out on what it wanted 
And turned bright enough to blind out any discussion, 
On how it should all be blamed on this draping that we covet, 
Keep it all sacred my cape be on out in public, 
Cause it could never harm me, it just takes away what does 
And then replaces it with all that they would say I never was, 
It takes what they believed and leaves them to second guess it, 
To where they wanna be it and see if they can reflect it, 
Bet you that it’s with me if I’m fighting for a city 
That’s electing to align with whoever’s up against me 
And they’re looking at my kind as a reason to forget me 
And I’m moving like it’s fine for everyone who defends me, 
I bet you that it got me when 12 is driving by me 
And wondering if I’m low enough for them to hide me, 
And it got me if I need it to describe my intentions 
And it’s loyal to the point where it defines who I been with, 
And it got me if I need it to perform when they reaching, 
If they catch me then I know this cape on me if I’m leaking, 
It’ll catch whatever’s pouring to the floor before I see it, 
And it’ll be the reason your applause runs the deepest, 
And it’ll catch whatever might pour from your peoples, 
Leaning on the top of it, 
Face on the shoulder of it, looking for the obvious, 
Pushing for a reason tryna seek to where the bottom is, 
Swear it ain’t no stopping it, 
All black draping, drawstrings hanging, 
Bet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, 
Bet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred, 
Everything it does for me is all in correlation, 
All black draping, drawstrings hanging, 
Bet that it can cover me from all of that awaiting, 
Bet you that it covets me and wants to keep me sacred,

The way it protects me 
And it won’t let you ever forget me, 
It won’t let you ever regret me 
No it won’t 
Bet you that it’ll protect you

Circling the check cash, tryna catch a new zoe, 
Talk keynote or kilo', I can do both, 
Crowned me for being the first to put 'em too close, 
Underrate him but over pay him is how the loop go,

And you know, jump in your lane and pull the echoes,

"All Day, Always",Music For My Friends,2015.0,"All day, always
All of us is for it
Ain't a song change
All the shit we saw is what we all became
And we all that we got 'long as the song plays

We hung out in front of the corner store
Got older and took it to the liquor store
Money low, so bet we wanted more
Only way we'll separate is how we pick the course
Of course we, know where we belong, we
Nowhere next to home but won't be long until we home, see
Know that when we home we putting on where they can all see
Know that they'll adore how we adorn so as long as we
Loaded up with cargo, whichever way the car go
The outcome's a murcielago
Mercy upon anyone feeling mercy at their heart tho
My outcome's a merciless God flow
God be with us, a R&B bitch is enough to inspire us
And we Dej Loaf for that loaf if they comfortable trying us
See?, baby it's easy to adapt to what you be around
Being next to A' is why my aim will never see the ground
Being next to Bro is why you know we all or nothing right?
Being next to Mel we never fell, we never cut the lights
Being next to Pesos
Was GQ and Bishop before their hiccups
Cause loyalty is nothing you can pay fo'
Love him like brother, that man there like my brother
And if it ever should come to it that man would let a K' go
So going for advancement is the root we would stand in
Scared of being dormant so, we grew with our hands in
Hands put together, all the prayers people sent us
Saying don't believe the hype, don't grow up to be a ni**er
Don't grow up and become a typical ni**er while you here
Like who you with every day, leave them ni**as over there
What?, damn, I feel funny even saying that
That word is foreign and my friends could never make me that

The Moments That Matter,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"The moments we all waited for
Dreaming down on the first, we all paying for
More to be expected and more to get you acquainted on
We all in for the win until the parade is on
We're gone, and the drive is with the roof peeled
The AC on, providing how the truth feels
Cold, chilly chill like our demeanor be
But all of this shit is really about the scenery
Cause sightseeing's like window shopping
You might see it and proceed to believe it, you bust a move or move
You might lead it like the intro got it
You might be it and proceed to believe it, it takes you to be you
It takes us to be us, and we the same the cloth
Knotted up together forever, to rearrange was
Not in the design or the ties that bind us
We saw it and got on it, no blinders, you see it now

Wanted it as much as we wanted to breathe
Top down, what a beautiful scene
Saw it for the taking and wanted a piece
Saw it for the taking and made 'em believe
Know that the moment won't change
The moments that matter the most to us
Know that the moment won't change
The moments that matter the most to us

And all of this carpe diem, double parking a BM
If the legacy is right then we staring at mausoleums
But for now, know the moment is here and now, and gone forever
Envisioning what the song get us
Feeling like I'm money making Mitch, in the store like I'm broke baby
Forgetting all that I got on, ain't my ropes crazy?
I'm in this bitch looking like I sell dope baby
To these women I sell hope baby
Shit I swear I'm just my daddy all over again
The only one on the block so now we all like him
Tell the money, I want the love, baby I want the love
For all the right reasons that may just be from above
I came up where you see the paper and fall in love
And the only way you got your Mercedes was off of drugs

Short Money,Peddler Themes,2017.0,"Short money looked so tall when we stood up near it
Told us that we could see it louder, had to look to hear it
Looking further from what we heard of made it more apparent
Apparently hearing these was looking in mirrors
Tall when we stood up next to it, stood tall if there was ever room for questioning
Knowing all of your rep in it, height became a precedent
Tall like extended's on the end of what they bring when they grip and get to collecting it
Money had us adept to it
Power shotgun in the ride with the respect and so we got to L.O.X'ing it
Track 5 connecting it
And know that if I'm dealing with 5 it's 4-5 in the sky, 
Mitchell & Ness'ing it
Grey uniform, Nike checking it
Childhood pictures had us pissing on hydrants, G-Depping it
Nickel and diming seems effortless
Til the crown heavy cuz the nickel and diming breed replicas
Saw it off the arm while eyeing the divas jumping outta cars
With lines of fiends plucking on their arms
Bitches brushing em away while they dying to see what's jumping with the bomb
And 550's was dumping outta jars
I mean, who would've knew you could fit a car in a flour jar
Or you can fill it wit half and get your Audi on
Short money looked so long like car payments
But short money turn those off like court cases
Casing a dream like it was yours and we was taxing it
The lane get too cluttered with dreams you start trafficking
The dichotomy of starting at the back of it
I'm a Jay-Z Kweli accident
Hybrid of the park bench and park slope
But the thought of living in park slope was all jokes
""peace God"", peace God, now the shit is explained
It makes sense like a lick for a brick and some change

Short money what they taught us when they put us here
Said it take so long to count it that we wouldn't care
Short money what they taught us when they put us here
Said it take so long to count it that we wouldn't care

Ending wasn't ever understood
Word to killing everything we could, and pray we're good
Things I, should've told my friends
Thought we all saw it and, knew how this would end, yet again
Ending wasn't ever understood
Word to killing everything we could, and pray we're good

In love with living like a song of mine
But know that living off the love is only borderline
And the lines left to get across to get you more could get you lost
So they said to bring a cross like they was talking lines
Mapping out the most heinous of a way in
And you bottle your emotions like a weigh in
And waving at the thought of what they see in us, never really being us
Like we was saying hi but it was leaving us
The couple that believe in us is looking like the pair that we can stand on
And standing on your word is all that's left to put your hands on
My hands was on the wheel but we forgot to bring the cross
So all the lines that they was talking 'bout was more than what we thought
Pray to God that he forgive us and he fuck with us the long way
Cause we just want the room screaming Stronjay, ""Stronjay!""
Word to all the Jacqueline's and all that we've attracted and
The fear that forgiveness ain't the only thing that matters and
It turns into the...


And I'm perceived as sorta making it
Toast to all the imagery and all of the mistakes in it
Seeing is believing til you seen reciprocating it
Taught to hold the mirror up and never look away from it
And given what it means and everything that you can take from it
Holding out to try to find their place in it
And placing us with all the same motives but the motives got a way with us
Shame how they be lifting up away from us
And loyalty of standing with your day ones, banners with your a1's
Nike gloves rolling hand in hand with where you came from
Finger prints smeared, ambition in the air
Hands twitching and you drifting off the rhythm of despair
Cause we grew up the same but I had a couple ringers
Like my pops ain't never leave and my moms did every scene
So the story we was shooting stayed similar indeed
But my ending might've shifted even more than we perceived
On a long list of...

The kid who moms had 2 jobs while she was raising him
His pops got his hands dirty Tryna make a way for him
Outside looking more alluring everyday to him
Swear to God all of this could've went either way with him, right?
Cause street dreams are made of these
Your heroes push Beamers, Rovers and AMGs

Braille on the blueprint, stencil out the design of it
Parallel to whoever you with with is how you aligning it
The truck is even flyer if we the ones that's inside of it
They said the inside of your crib is how you come out of it
So jumping off the steps ain't a threat to who you was following
My man said he just know what he know, and shit is fine
As long as when he hit rewind that he got a big enough pot for it
Said that he straight drop with it
I saw the proof in it, 5's can turn to an A5 if you in a groove with it
Dance all on the root of it, step on the motive
And crowns coming with rounds is shit that they never told us
They said to see any further won't help you get any closer
But still it's 20/20, drilling who's coming for me
Pegs all on the back of my goose was how I grew
You rode then?, then you ride now, know how we do, like fuck it

5 stars out of a basement, they couldn't level us

And you don't know when forever leaves until forevers' done
But we don't gotta never say never, there's no bezel up
Ain't too many left here to breathe can stand next to us
Make sense that they got the seats if we forever up
From day one it was theme music for peddlers
And bitches buying loosies, weaves tucked in a Doobie
Queens under their Doobies, here off of pay phones
Im here til the jakes roll and I leave before they shoot me
They never leave from around us
Time took its place and they remembered Larry Davis and made a Kalief Browder
Pegs all on the back of my goose was how I grew
You rode then?, then you ride now, know how we do, like fuck it

You either runnin along or you a past mark
So either run with it forward or play the past part
There's no rides for the weary or weak
It's so quiet you can hear when you sleep
But so live you can clear in a week
With no ties, no ears to the street
No thrones, no homes, nothin on
Nothin promised outside, so what you hearin is cheap
They say we all in this together
But somethin gotta give or somebody gotta give 'til all of this get better
If all of this is forever and the goal is to change
Then you can't upset if we should go with our aim
And you can't see regrets if you controllin your lane
Put your hand on your heart and you solemnly swear to get it
Driver seat, right side or rear, you with it
Cause shit is wicked on these mean streets
But where the green be is where we tryin to stand, so we need reach
Dirty 'round here, so we need cleats, lace up now

I see you runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
I see you runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Huh, cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
Cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
Get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)

Every step taken is a step gained
Or a step lost, dependin on how your step change
When you step on, there's no returns or step aways
Either step cross or fall out of the step game
Shit is transparent tryin to find where the step's made
If I can't bare it, I'm a die where the step's raised
And I can't hear when they cry, I'm at a step's pace
Cause for the love of everything that we saw
Everything that we want is everything that keep us sprintin along
And the soles on your kicks turn as thin as the walls
So it's one knee down, both hands on the ground
When the six shot blows, all hands in the crowd
Turn parallel to you but the hands in the crowd
Were really just a mirage, ain't a stander around
Some look for God, some can't find a cloud
So they take it to the store where handlin is allowed
The money starts grownin as quick as the time change
Start countin your steps, the line is five away
Four left so you ease up with it like ""I'm straight""
You approach the third and they throw you a curve
And everything that you predicted is gone with the words (*echo*)

Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
I see you runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Keep runnin, somethin like a marathon
Huh, cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
Cause they can only catch you if you let 'em (if you let 'em)
So get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)
Get your marathon on when you steppin (when you steppin)

You approach the third and they throw you a curve
And everything that you predicted is gone with the words
You approach the third and they throw you a curve
And everything that you predicted is gone with the words
Everything that you predicted is gone with the words, huh

Long Money,Peddler Themes,2017.0,"Long money looked so short from 100 feet out
And counting down from 99 make you wanna reroute
98 will test your patience and all that you 'bout
97, 96, 95, hit a switch, like get a ride, hit a lick, fuck walking with time
Time will tell and mine will tell that we won 'fore we died
Or at least that's what they sell us and all of us buy
Feeling sorry for our mothers was all they replied
Like ""hurry up and buy"", and shots fly in response
Hurry up and die is what they kinda really want
Drop 5 in the front, or $4.99, new neighbors got these beers even higher
Fear the replier, 'cause shots fly in response and all you get to hear is the choir
The talk's heinous but it's here to inspire
The motive, is all the above, it reads like a coroner's love
And nobody's better, we all need a plug
Introductions turn to falling in love, let's keep it all of a buck
Nobody's better B, all of you suck
But back, to the lecture at hand
Going hand over fist, hand on a flip, no step on the plans
You outside?, no step on the plants, that's what the difference be
And intuition be all we want as a centerpiece
Center me as being, the minority that all the majority speaking thru
And speaking to you
Was a short money plan that turned into more
Bet it all took a turn when we heard the allure
It's just the life, of solemnly swearing over approaches
And leaning on a Beamer was all they needed to coach us
Suited up for this AAU, and may their stoops
Be protected as ever when that pay day loops
It comes around with a high and a low, a give and a take
They listen in for the breaks like finding a hole
You dip from the jakes and find your way home
My man went to the isle and caught the finest C.O
The bitch amazing, well according to him when we would kick it on the V.I
I'm hoping they transfer him and he kick it with Mumia
Word to Destiny's pops, we was taught that Heaven do watch
And police talk with they heckler and koch
I heard the latter, as well as my man saying
That he campaigning to catch a Milly if soda ever do rock
I wanted to put it all on a record or put it all on a screen
Or 2 for 1 like I was selling tops
One of my heroes is Spike, and another one is Jada
So baby I still want head in the drop
Love is love, love us for whoever we are
And if you never stood for that then we could be never be y'all
Learned how to stand tall when I was seated with my pops in the drop
And he was preaching how to be what y'all not
'cause dude I was with pops every day, and when I wasn't
He called my mother's crib either way and the discussions
Was drowning out the shit in the hallway
And the staircase was adjacent to our front doorway
So for that talk to drown out what the hall say
Means that it was louder than what the liquor store made
Raised by a goon who saw the bloom in his off spring
Thuggin' it, talcum on his middle finger, Malcom on his trigger finger
Cutting up and shooting out
But paused from 3 to 4 or whenever school was out
Know that it's Brooklyn forever son you already know
You stab me I leak Henny like I said befoe'
So, you do me dirty I still won, rap like steel drums
Rappers I feels none, except for Griselda
Red carpet to the yellow tape what they sells us
And they say that the money got us indebted to failures
It's tricky ain't it?, sitting and waiting while the shit is explained
Short money never came with a residual frame and...

Long money wasn't nothing that they taught us right?
Did whatever they could do to keep it from us right?
Said it take too long to count it and get on it right?
They put it far enough away from us to want it right?
Long money wasn't nothing that they taught us right?
Did whatever they could do to keep it from us right?
Said it take too long to count it and get on it right?
They put it far enough away from us to want it right?",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-long-money-lyrics
Complicated Rhythm,The Great Debater,2011.0,"They give me the same flack they gave Gloria son
Either or James or Carter, but both of them won
So either or take it to heart or eat all that you want
I made more reaching from y’all than hoping you sprung
The same door that he was in front of and wanted to rush
Is now leased in his name, did he come up or what
Strange' are in order, hallways did it for him?
Inspired to get it by him, Parkay of the talkers
Shit is butter like Big was still here on another life
I walk by them steps everyday, so now who wanna write?
Back like running lights and Po’ now follow
And that armrest is locked, so someone get the swallowing
If y’all blessed to watch, then someone get the honoring
On it like I’m towering, acknowledge my acknowledgment
Still means just what it says
So if you got it then consider you in the echelon of those hollerin’
Great Debater, made it the give and go
Kick fly talk and slide off, I’m Henry Lowe
Call it Complicated Rhythm
Cause as far as how they listening
They get it but don’t get it and I don’t bother what they missin’
If they missed it, no difference
Know them martyrs get dismissed
So it’s snowing all roses and the thorns is in the wind
And if you caught one in the end
You was drawn to it again
You clicked on the ZShare, you just bought you a syringe
This shit is in reach where they got to bargain to get in
So give him the scene there, they’ll be nodding off again
Now I pardoned it again, I was pardon off of wonders
And I Drew it like I play point guard for the Thunder
So all of what it leads to, started off the EQ
Wasn’t Dwyane Wade but I was on my Jordan 3 move
Wasn’t Dwayne Wayne but had a broad like Keanu
And jealous bitches called her “kee low-low”
, I see you HA!

Return of the Real,The Salvation,2009.0,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Just Blaze, Bar and Grill extravaganza
We got Jamla juices right over there on the left
Fort Knocks soy burgers on the right
The entertainment tonight is my man, S-K-Y-Z-O-O
With that Return Of The Real
Ladies and gentlemen put your hands together
Here we go!

I'm feelin like it's workin, I feel it when I work it (uh huh)
It's feelin like if 
June '96
 was in service
The ceiling might move when I lift up to pen my cursive
They predictin it will, so the hype is fittin it's purpose
They was missin the real, I write it and make it worth it
Call it how it feels but as far as gettin a word in
You swallow that for real and keep it the way you heard it
When they playin catch up, I'm tearin the tape deck up
Maybe's it April '94, half moon partin it
And I don't see a lane but I'm seein the page that's carvin it
So I don't need a lane, you can keep away with the bargainin
I ain't wear a cuff yet and you see where my cup rests
Sittin on the shoulders of anybody who jump next
Powder in the air, burgundy wears, Upper Deck
None of them can worry me, my pennin is worry free
And the moment it breathes, it's September 13th
 - 2X
It's the return of the real, about as real as you knew
See how I jumped in this for real, yeah I'm livin the proof
Know that you wanted it for real, so I give you the new
And you remember how it feel, yeah I give you that too

It's the return of the real
I see them lookin for the real but they ain't find that yet
A couple made it but they ain't recognize that yet
I see them lookin for the real but they ain't find that yet
A couple made it but they ain't wanna rewind that yet
So now they lookin on me, they lookin towards me
Now they lookin on me, they lookin towards me
Now they lookin on me, they lookin towards me
And they recognize I as the look that they all need

And for the visually impaired, they stared until they saw it
It was clearer than the thinnest of air, so they was on it
Fuck comparing, ain't a thing over there that could walk along it
Beside it or in front of it, try it and live under it
One of the last left, who pen it as it is
So from jump I was past left and spinnin back again
They don't get it, they don't comprehend it
So my talk be, listed as different, they throw they hindrances on me (woo)
Picture me trippin, my walk gimpy, see it's on beat
A told me get 'em, so I get 'em 'til they caught me
All said and done, you can all say that they all me
Birthed 'em, if it's '
95, I August 1st 'em
Couldn't find nobody truer as far as verbs
The mouthpiece for all the pursuers for +What It's Worth+
So when it turns out that I be what the term 'bout
Can't say that I ain't signal nobody to turn 'round, right?



Uh, yeah, uh huh
It's the Return Of The Real baby, uh

Realization,A Dream Deferred,2012.0,"Playing middle ground, hoping this middle counts
And if don't, hoping I can keep my middle down
Fingering triggers at a dream if they sniff one out
Guess this aroma's gonn' kill me now, any how
Any means, catching finish lines in a quicker reach
Yves Saint Laurent helped em get to get me
We just made it all and it's all just the centerpiece
Playing middle ground like if this is what it gets to be
Being that we on, tryna be on one
They might add another by the time that we all done
I be saying we cuz if its me its all us
I be saying me cuz if its we its all hush
I did it off of lust, until they fell in love
Hustle from the heart, whatever be your drug
And then you realize if they never let you run
You'd be right where you was tryna be beside from the jump
And then you realize

I've realized
That I feel like
I'm so blind
Til I'm on my own
And I realize
That this seems like
The only way to go
Tonight

Its underneath you when you looking up
Never concerned cuz you never had to look for trust
Left it to burn when you left it for that look of love
Until your hustle unhook a plug
More than a hustle if every word that I uttered
Was for the better of us like nothing could ever cut us
Whatever could become us, was waiting past aim
Good stadium numbers, famous last name
Seated in a dream but playing musical chairs
And seeing who you be just gave proof to me there
The proof in is the air, you was who you was 'fore I got there
Hope your last name don't drop there
In it for the win til its said and done, laced up to let it run
Spraining ACL's, more steps to come
And then you realize if they never let you run
You'd be right where you was tryna be beside from the jump
And then you realize


Fingering triggers at a dream if they sniff one out
Guess this aroma's gonn' kill me now
Anyhow, still I'm down, for whatever be
Always said I'll stay awake if I ever dream",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-realization-lyrics
Everything’s For Sale,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"Outside still smelling like where the winners at
Look at all these empires under these fitted hats
Look at the grills on the cars we could be leaning on
Now look at all these unmarked cars that's grilling back
Fuck, how real is that? How real it is
All of us is just pictures of what the city did
The city made us to keep it the way you see it though
Or be alone when the world say what the city is
And we is who we say we is, you know us well
Part nerd, part grind like I know Pharrell
Frenzies outside, don't ever slow the deal
No circulars here you can't hold a sale, for real
Lo sweats and aqua 8s
Blew through the caution as long as you got a plate
Fruits of the labor whoever should want a taste
Swear we heard it all yo, everything they would say, all of it tho'

Everything's for sale
Told us 5 passports
And we never going to jail
So we working on the 2nd
And the 3rd and the 4th and the 5th
Til it clicks like everything is for real
For real

Six degrees from whoever you need to get you yours
And tryna get it is everything they applaud
Applause come by the doubles in double R's
The rhythm of it is trusting in the facade
Of an 80 thou' genie but it's flyer than Lashonte
Tinted up, me and mine hiding like I'm Wanya
Role players rather stand around til your part change, out for your cast, everybody
On they Andre, right?
But we the products of seeing product and comprehending
You see a bottle, you see a model, you compliment it
Early morning on that Mourning off a hard block
Calling Zo season tryna make a couple cards pop
Pop! Like when you sitting in your living room
And you can hear pop! on the daily til it's typical
Tying up the motives like my double entendres
Until my friends can tell you that I LeBron'ed them


As real as they told us to be when the lights get to us
Like do it right and them fluorescents might stick to us
Star gazed like ""see them and picture us""
The top flies off the Veuve and you steal the rush
Cause me and A' was going half on a hero while we'd pass by the heroes
Added how they had it then we passed by them heroes, elevator awe
Kills us to show them what a respirator's for
But all of us came up hearing everything's for sale",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-everythings-for-sale-lyrics
’95 Bad Boy Logo,Peddler Themes,2017.0,"The agenda don't ever change much, the same from when we came up
It stick with us now, to fit a crown without fucking your fade up
You double down on your way up
Up on your way, up for the day til the day done
Night turn to drop jeeps and Alize runs
The soundtrack to it in the back where the weight's tucked
The baselines cover bass lines til the tape stuck
Fast forward to the B-sides where the tape run
We kept the drop jeeps but turned the rest into Spade runs
Running for chart space
Running like if we was running off of a court date with a gun in the door safe
Red bones at the light, fuck with this car chase
Bunch of Lorel's got it looking like 4 Faiths
Drawn to the light post, right so
Rightfully hypefully know that we just want the allure straight
Playing BYOBs up in Kum Kau, like y'all don't sell Privilege
So we just brought it with us
And we just want the finals to not feel like a scrimmage
It ain't about the title its who you bodied to get it
And anybody can get it, word to a Sean Combs remix
And whatever Sean Combs did, we did
Same rule applied like summersaulting a key out, key in
Shit is ordained like a prefix
All we really wanted was a '95 bad boy logo
On the back of a letterman, backstage at letterman
Fitted over my brow like I was Mason Betha in
Patent leather 11s and, the band play the record and
Puff screaming how we won't stop while I get settled in
To the swing of the record and, then the swing of the record is
Tryna mimic this St. Laz piece over my neck and I
Get to swinging this rhetoric, Fulton street benevolent
But rap like a clip off the waist before the sedatives
OZ orchestra, theme music for peddlers
But back to the scene and the stage that I was setting and
The feeling of a Hitman record gets
Higher than Branson, or fly as a Vanson
Or fly as BIG buying keys outta advances
Fuck up a bag and run it back or run it round
Rollie's in the sky, bet nobody brung 'em down
And when he told you ""t-bone steak cheese eggs and welches grape""
I grew up between Mikes and Country House
Mikes is better, the lights is better when you underneath
You light up whoever when you wanna eat
Looking up to a logo of a toddler with his fist in the air
Or letting the lama rip in the air
Because all we really wanted was a '95 Bad Boy logo
On the back of a letterman, backstage at Letterman
Fitted over my brow like I was Mason Betha in
Patent leather 11s and, the band play the record and
Puff screaming how we won't stop while I get settled in
To the swing of the record and, then the swing of the record is

By Any Means,Theo vs J.J. (Dreams vs. Reality),2012.0,"By any means, my enemy is in plenty reach
So if the need is get 'em leant to get a lead
Then shit'll lean, like literally, hit 'em clean
Until they clean off the mirror, like ""shit is me""
And then I'm trying to regroup thoughts
All these plans I was making to get me moved off
And didn't know it, right
Now that I know it right
I'm ducking cameras on the corner trying to blow the lights
Blowing lights, car covered in scars, cutting the smog
And the smoke screens under the stars, what a facade
When the smoke seems up and beyond I bust a U-ey
I'm Old School, all of my slang is that truly
Pardon me if I'm different
Part of me's reminiscing
And part of me's 20/20
So part of me wouldn't miss it
Part of me's Montclair and 
part is Nautica sweats
Part of me's by the stairs, and part of me's on a jet
But all of me's the embodiment of a Yankee fitted
The only one who was riding up with a Yankee in it
Fuck it though, chalk it up to the rap
Nobody introduced me to Nia so now I'm back
Like, can it all be so simple now? Can it be?
When everyone that you a fan of is a fan of me?
I use that to try to see what just this fandom be
And if it don't go as planned, then I just plan to leave
Leave before it turns and they swear it didn't
By any means you saw the difference
Raised as a witness like Jill Scott and the Jacksons
But born the day before Christmas oh shit I'm probably backwards
I'm living out of a wrapper
Gold ones to be honest
With big XLs all over them if you jocking
Just being honest, something nobody ever is
Relevant problems because the problem is relevance
Invincible in the memo section
Mo'erfuckers shoulder reading, trying to get a reflection
By any means
I'm trying to make it all make sense
Or talk money on the beat so we can all pay rent

Playing Cody Chesnutt the theme song
Nothing but an open heart for me to lean on
Trying to get my green grown
Children singing out to the high heavens
Lord please help us help us not to be clones
Wherever we roam
I feel the load weigh heavily telling them reload
I just want peace though
Peace within us are in
Peace from within shines brighter than the stars
And the cars and the shards of the jewel
And the bezel, the tools to dishevel
The views of the youth that are used as a vessel
To tell the truth, I used to dream of it too
But tell me, what's an honest Commie to do?
I mean the obvious route
Stack it up to give it back and what not
Instead of stack to get a pad with a yacht
By any means, I'm trying to feed my people
Need to do or you die
Until I'm in the zoo in the sky
Almighty Open am I

By any means, my enemy was in plenty reach
Tried to passenger seat it and balance him and me
Shit ain't working so now I'm trying to get where he be
And Subzero that mo'erfucker within his sleep
Looking down at a mirror where his pillow be
Reached for him and got to it to keep him sleep
No hustle involved, but I was beating me
Know the hustle involved if should you see him leave
Know we run to the stars whenever we in reach
How they come through in cars that we don't seem to see",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-by-any-means-lyrics

Do you know, where you going to?, draw up what they know of you, 
Picture that with enough space for whoever should go with you, 
Told me what we here for, same way it was told to you, 
My Saint Laz’s heavy enough to pray over both you, 
Meaning, yall and me is, a-alikes for the being 
Of time, time being a way to find you a lead in,

This shit feels like we living a life being caught in a high, 
Been in jail since my daddy was born, 
But my pen is collateral bond, 
Oh my God, oh my God, 
Are we really free here? 

Either way it's, more than just what they're saying, 
Say you look in the tone and it shows you what they're portraying, 
They giving you the tone that you need like you was related, 
Feeling like to atone is to keep it from ever fading, 
Til you knew the tone you receiving was off a payment, 
Like when it's two tones on the V' that you serenading, 
Mike '92 tone on the Beamer, Rockaway Ray it, 
Or white and blue tone from the D's all in the way and, 
It gets, in between, soon as you got it you grey it, 
I mean, silly me for tryna Co-Op and New Day it, 
I be, centerpieced like I was tryna two way it, 
I preach, Hennessy but I see the need to Dusse it, 
The thought of pink bottles of Spade turns into spilling them, 
Over flow on the dough like the red bones that deliver them, 
Yeah, be as it may, shit will seem to be straight, 
And banking on collateral's what it be out the gate, either way

This shit feels like we living a life being caught in a high, 
Been in jail since my daddy was born, 
But my pen is collateral bond, 
Oh my God, oh my God, 
Are we really free here? 

And you in the back of a rental, in front of a bag of maybes, 
Like maybe shit'll move to where you can call this the 80's, 
Or maybe this is ruined and you in for an awakening, 
And the tone that you knew was the root why you mistaken, 
And waiting, and still waiting, and still waiting, 
Told youngin on my second classic to drill a way in, 
Word to any misconception that they drilled to us, 
'cause you still shooing to kill if you kill the shooters, 
They told us fuck it..

Either way it's what we want so do believe what we on baby, 
I respond like We just here to pick up on some money 'fore they tell us we gone baby 
They respond like Get it how you live and how you live is how to get it to God baby,

This is yours right? (""It's yours!"") forever and then a day, 
Leaning on it while you picture your destiny with a stray, 
Given time, spending time with destiny in the way, 
Finish time, finish lines is everything they proclaimed, 
I proclaim, that we was in line for it, 
Visionary riches baby, we got the eyes for it, 
Caught up in the trace should you leave your design on it, 
You look at your name like you should be down to die for it, 
Or live a little, spill a little and represent, 
Deal with a bottle the way you deal with the decadence, 
Or deal with a hollow the way you deal with the negligence, 
Like ""you get in the know, or deal with the reload,”

But still what a day 

What a day at the park
What a day at the park
 
It was a dreary day 
'Til I stepped out 
Ice cream trucks passing us all 
Red ballon I'll follow you 
Till the night comes back around again 
Comes back around again
As I think to myself—

—what a day at the park
What a day at the park

Said to make owning a roof part of a habit, 
But learned that sitting in rooms that didn't have 'em, 
Heard that as getting your roof was all that mattered, 
All that to lift off the roof, could you imagine, 
The irony of the top being behind you, 
Be it the roof or the proof of who defied you, 
Or keeping your roof how you knew so that it hides you, 
Or see the recoup turn to coupes and it reminds you
That killing the roof, make it easier to hear who applaud, 
Whether it's ""bravo yall"" or airing at your car, 
Whether it's ""bravo yall"", staring at your arms 
And how they can fit up under, how to live up the summer, 
The park and how it does us, is credit achieved, 
Same 456ing over Peddler Themes, 
Same view of intuition you was led to believe, 
Same shooters in position if you ever do need, 
And the feeling been the same since you been in that seat 
But what a day

What a day at the park
What a day at the park

""What a day at the park""

Told em pay us like you owe us but attention you can keep
Said it's better when it's quiet baby slip that underneath
So to tuck away the convo, conversing in morse code
Seem like everything it should be, til they're beyond those
Putting everything on your leap unless the alarm broke
A ki' might lead to a key to where Nia Long go
Visionary riches turn to missionary missions
But fuck if I'm sitting still unless I'm sitting near a digit
Bet you you'll reconsider if you consider where we get it
The sweetest shit that you ever dreamed, 'til you arisen
Like wait, hold up

I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep kinda different
When it's begging you to get it
I mean, peep it
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep is out the norm
But I'm with it 'til the morn
At least, peep it

I go to sleep and see a kilo
Dressed as opportunity, hand over the peep hole
Collecting my gratuity, married to the reload
As long as we repeating we'll never be with the repos
Call it how it be but we'll never be with the belows
If we looking underneath then we looking up under seats
Now look up at your beliefs, and down at your wrist
Then you look up at what you need and blow it down on a flip
I'm just looking to get a key, the one for the door furthest
And the dream turned into short orders and tall murders
With a fist full of dollars ignorance is so blissful
Wishful in thinking where that ignorance can get you
Get us where we need and we'll call it even and leave
Oversleep 'cause you know it's easier there to breathe
And sleeping in the thought of the above off the love
Til the lock is all plugged and you banking on a key, you get it?

I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep kinda different
When it's begging you to get it
I mean, peep it
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep is out the norm
But I'm with it 'til the morn
At least, peep it

Starting to think I need counseling
'Cause when I go to sleep I see 36 ounces
Damn, all I remember was the bouncers
Telling me put the smoke out, tryna move this coke out
Woke up in a cold sweat, then I broke out
Tryna go back where I left, it ain't right though
You know I'm in the kitchen to chef, straight nitro
Fiends say when they take a hit, it make the pipe glow
Hoping I see the same shit the next night yo
Great powder, we usually don't allow it
If this is what it's about, I'ma need my 8 hours
'Cause dreams come true at the end of the day
Pray before I wake that I finish the yay
When you don't recognize your blessings you send 'em away
But let's keep that on the d-­low
When I go to sleep I see a kilo, what? HA-HAAAEEH!

I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep kinda different
When it's begging you to get it
I mean, peep it
I go to sleep and see a ki'
Sleep is out the norm
But I'm with it 'til the morn
At least, peep it

Baby, you need me
Wake up for me. I know you see me
When you wake up baby, come to me
Come back to me baby, let me be yours
Te voy a enseñar lo que puede llegar a ser conmigo
Todo lo que siempre has deseado era real puede llegar a ser real para ti papi
Lead me to the street, come see me baby",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-see-a-key-ki-lyrics

I ain't lost a step
Respect is through the ceilin', I ain't lost a rep
I ran a hundred laps and I ain't lost a breath
So fuck whoever's next
Youngin' I'm the moment at hand
And may God help you
Or you gonna get to know that man
Son I'm past what your aim is
Fuck around and try to get famous
And you'll be slap boxin' the stainless
Naw, that ain't tough talk
Dude it's live
I'm from the block where the king was movin' 2 for 5's
So in the legacy of B.I.G., I'm on my B.I. lean
I treat beats like P.Y.T.s, I slut 'em
S-K, the bottom of the ninth is mine
In blue and white pinstripe designs
And when my pen drips
I'm on my win shit
I Draino your career, you hear that drip drip
I clear it out

Yo, I came for a lot of shit talkin' and kid sparkin' is awesome
I treat Walkmen's like skip buttons is off 'em
Hit the rewind when I'm spit talkin' so often
My intro the only shit I been performin'
The swag out of this world
The flow is ridiculous
It's me, Sky and Preem, we sicker than syphilis
And you outta your mind to think you can get with this
The boy body the booth and bury the witnesses
But bare witness to lyrical giftedness
Nigga this the difference
What you been missin' is
A new breed of the raw
My ingredient is pure, a nutritional break down of the boy
Will show traces of the wildest parts of Shakur
I've been a Mic Fiend since Ra walked in the door
But now they changed the locks and fucked up the entrance
Till me and Sky blow the shit off the hinges

I'm So Ghetto
I Represent the back of the field
But I'm overflowin' with Mass Appeal
I'm like Royalty, Just To Get A Rep
I'm on my own dick
It's like '95 all over again

It's reminiscent of Nas or Jay, Billy or Womack
Another classic collab, we feel like a throwback
NYG'z always know where the doe at
I use my Termanology to find where these hoes at
A true Poet and I'm wise as a Guru
'Cause when you Teflon, ain't no stickin' it to you
I'm Nice as Smooth

Playing Favorites,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"The scene set for you to kill the room
Blowing kisses while you hitting everything that move
Murder when attention seems to get to you
My attention all that matters til it's getting thru
Thru to what I need most, usually what I keep close
Close enough to where you knew it like if we home
Told that I be stretching, we can see how far my reach go
Then I can reload, uh, and hit repeat mode
Pardon, I'm just a fan of better moments
And sitting with this bottle's where I stand to let you know it
Truth by the shot glass, handle what I'm throwing
And catching Avion got you handing me your phone and
I proceed before I leave like ""she got me where she want me""
But a win is for the win, winning lotto ticket money
Going for it in your message saying we gonn' see
And how your coat still smells like Givenchy and that you love it

Baby I just want the time to show you how
I can be your favorite kind throughout the crowd
Cause we steady chasing
And we were playing favorites
And we became one

Told you what it'd be like, and what you should expect
It all came to you off the rip, no regrets
They ask you if you good, you think of how I rep
And your eyes get wide, you ain't dealing with your ex
Cause you know how I rep, your crew start to notice it
Seen it in your step, my name all over it
Same rules apply, you see it all up mine
So when we step as a pair, every pair step aside
Reason to believe whoever I used to be
Is aside with them steps, say bye to who they seen
Say hi to knowing me, and hi to who you be
Cause being in the now is the high that you need
And product is the key, and you know nothing added to me
No steps, no pageant for me
So tell 'em all I do is rap and serve, like imagine how I serve
You see how I was flowing on my last cd


Your favorite one
Your favorite one
Your favorite one
Your favorite one

The moment you find what you wasn't looking for
But soon as you got it can you never put it back
Built off the juggle I know the worth of a double
Your hands work with the double and you let the money stack
Same rules apply, you see it all up in mine
They're one in the same kind I just handle the react
Do it how you do it I promise you I ain't moving
I knew it before I knew it, I forever wanted that",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-playing-favorites-lyrics
Written In The Drums,The Great Debater,2011.0,"Ok, written like I'm Nasir, predicting in 5 years
Y'all will understand what I been kicking on the contrare
Contrary to the popular and what they all share
I'll be sitting where I'm high enough to hit Lamont's ear
Product of ebonics but that AP, made me
Balance out the cameras when I handle where the great be
Handling what I handle when I'm handing you that hd
Homicide driven but we tripping where the cake be
Out of line penning they was trying to find vision
I was filling in the blanks that was provided by they ignorance
And I be just as ignorant, according to the grind
Paper my agenda, and the flow is to coincide
Call me proud to be a testament, prolly he who repping it
Made him understand it through a crowded sea of negligence
Swam against the current, get from round me if you question it
We be in it till it's nothing left in this

See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it with
But you know they be on it till I'm gone
See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it with
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it
But you know they be on it till I'm gone

See it's already written like I'm Christopher, corner store literature
In the most literal, you don't gotta picture us
Know it off the open, you ain't got to front and center us
Motherfuckers doubt until they viewing what attention does
When you was watching me on 106 like how you get up there
I was on a 20 minute call with a billionaire
Boomeranging ideas on how to get my million here
Told me get rich or die trying before you're finished here
Got it 50, glued to every word that he would serve
And in return I make him turns like if he said what better product is
And I'm just trying body this
Should money bring me loneliness, I'll be here alone counting out like yeah the lonely wins
Maybe you ain't know me then, and probably never will
I'm from where everything that matters is a dollar and a pill
So if bottling emotion is a battle for the kill
It's either that or go and bottle up your ills

See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it with
But you know they be on it till I'm gone
See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it with
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it
But you know they be on it till I'm gone

See it's already written in the flow a little different this time
But the wizardry that lyrically assembled this line it's like
If I'm selling phones like you could get these on the go
In a weather 20 low and they ain't scheduled till July
And if you figured out that line and you resemble what resides
Within the souls of these foams, the worries and the strive
The upscale vandal, the worries put behind
I write on mahala and serve it through L'Chaim's

See it's already written in the drums
So I ain't got to talk to it
But if I should decide to, I'm the one to honor it
If I should decide to, I'm the one they own it with
But you know they be on it till I'm gone
See it's already written in the drums

Friend Or Foe Pt. 3,UnKnown,2016.0,"I been waiting 20 years
Shit, I been waiting 20 years
Waiting 20 years

You was thinking Cold Crush back then on the move
But you gon' rethink it all when I'm finished with you
You was thinking Cold Crush back then on the move
But you gon' rethink it all when I'm finished with you

Friend or foe yo, state my biz?
They always said revenge is slow so, here it is
20 years in the making
I been waiting more or less
More so to draw slow
And Picasso your chest, let me back track
'96 flexing, you ran across a bredren
Hands on a trunk full, tap dance stepping
Perico stretching, small town juggling
Tryna do the 1st to the 15th and be done with it
He was down in Newport, you was on your way there
Both of y'all from New York, one of y'all should've stayed there
Both tryna play there
A come up was a given
But when the aim's the same
You shooting at a collision, so you stick him
Caught him on the humble on his way out
Surrounded him, reached on your waist and pulled the trey out
Room keys led to a few ki's
That's how the game go, none of that shit confuse me
But like a year later he was back south, motel 6'ing
You was juggling 
Rap City
 and stove whipping
You found him, gave him demands over the business
Then clapped him, one in the stomach like ""good riddance""
And this is, where the story change on the dial
Cause he died saying ""all he would ever miss is his child""
And speaking of, know that that child ain't been a child in forever
20 years just decided to catch up
And here we are
And the look on your face is so upsetting
Cause I was looking for Iceberg based on your records
Come on, where the cool at?
Where the ""cough up a lung"" face screw at?
What's up with the panic?
You don't do that
But you never would've knew that
The dude you was booking
Had a baby 10 minutes away from you in Brooklyn
Cause me? I'm from Tompkins
The same ones you said run their mouths just like y'all
And was foul just like y'all
Is it foul that I got in here by leaving a rack with the receptionist?
You'd call it money well invested
And I'm with, two heaters, Bluetooth speakers
My theme music blaring
Serenade you with ""Ether"", let's do it
You was catching bodies and escaping
Then bragging about it to 20,000 on stages
Imagine, having to grow up without a dad and
Being reminded of how you lost him through a playlist
And waiting, to be in this office with all your ranks
And all your Basquiats and your floor seats and all your bank
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Are now alumni from Harvard
Why would you even bother?
So it's me and these two 9's
Rounding up applause
And yea I thought about how you might have one in the drawer
But I was like ""nah, duke Lemonad'ing with his woman
And he ain't been tough since like '98 or something""
And something gotta give
I'm like, ""this mu'fucka went and took a father from his kid
So now I'm walking him from his""
And ""him"" being YOU
Either that, or empty out them Swiss's you done you grew
Like a Swisher on the stoop
Stop itching when you move
Keep it De La cool
Or all of this will turn into reverse déjà vu
And you from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
So you gonn' keep your mouth closed while I take these plaques
And I ain't old enough to buy yo' spade
But I'm old enough to yap it from inside yo' place, throw me a case
See my mind's like a flower in bloom
They celebrating while I'm dedicating
Guess I'm outta the loop
20 years I been plotting for now, call it war
20 years outta pocket and now?
I'm all in yours
And money comes in quick but leaves out faster
So I'm paying Dame tomorrow for them 
Reasonable Doubt
 masters
Now do something...

Asking Bodie For A Package,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen
Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves
Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene
Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve
Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts
More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count
On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out
Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town
Town business like you found business when you brought it down
Borderline til a 745's brought around
And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away
You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away
Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away
Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, 
doe or die

Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours

It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout
Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs
The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist
And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out
Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front
Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want
But retro's is a weekly occurrence
And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished
In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone
Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home
'til they teach you bout a throne and the leather that the seat on
Is from the same couch you got your feet on
Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on?
Grew up idolizing like ""if Jay on, then we on""
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die


It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in
Pressure bends knees like the side effects of klonopins
You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans
The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try agains
Silence, talk less and do more
No time to ask ""who is it?"" when knockers knock at your door
Put yourself in a position to listen
Or be a victim
Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore
When summer falls, we spring into the winter
Recruit 'em at front and center
Move product with new beginners
So the package that we lend ya
Out of respect for ya father
Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow
Just do it how they taught ya
And everything will work if you believe that
Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that?
Thrown in the position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed or denied
Doe or die",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-asking-bodie-for-a-package-lyrics
The Ellis Wilson Painting On The Wall,Theo vs J.J. (Dreams vs. Reality),2012.0,"11 racks for a painting, said its kind of steep but the meaning it came with
Make it all worth it
Worth it to be paying
Cleaning off the mantle, living room waiting
The living room saying ""we made it"" of some sort
Running from whatever but know what we run for
Is to run this shit forever and hopefully want more
Expect me to keep this baton from off the floor
 (x4)
They expect me to
Pick it up, pick it up
Get it

Expected to carry the tradition on
Born in it and honestly couldn't wish for more
Applaud with it, promised I wouldn't miss a call
But torn in it so part of me wants to skip it all
All of it, all of this to live up to
And living from the past when you live as a Huxtable
If this is what you ask then give me my just do
Living off of that they was keeping us comfortable
For 300 thousand, yearly, brought up into the house
And clearly and all of this is my outcome
But clearly dyslexic, dumbing me down shit
I'm seeing letters backwards, numbers ain't rounding
For prom limos, renting out helicopters
Its all apparent like all of y'all better watch us
All I hear is they all got better options
And so to opt out at all was never options
 (x2)
So for that painting on the wall
No matter what its worth, never have to take that off
Keep your last name living, your last name did it
All the way to the bank, take your last name with it
One time

Worrisome until all of the worry's done
10 Stigwood Ave fam we worry none
You heard wrong if you believe that song, the worry comes
Every time I hear my last name on a worried tongue
We wanted the same living, fucked with the same women
But me and Cockroach wasn't cut from the same ribbon
So, salute to you cause me and mine was cornered in
Impossible sneakers to fill like we was Jordan kids
Or better yet they gave us a briefcase
And a stethoscope and the hope that you breathe straight
I hope that you be awake when it all goes
Late nights trying to bring this doctorate on home
Mentor to Stanley, I'm doctoring almost
Till they went and shot up son's car on the wrong road
Look like I'm a product of tomorrow, lord knows
I'm just trying to bottle up tomorrow and pour it slow
Never be enough though
 (x2)
 (Bridge x4)
11 racks for a painting, said its kind of steep but the meaning it came with

Test Drive,The Great Debater,2011.0,"Ok, sitting in the essence of it all seated better than before
My autograph resembles the sketches on the wall
To blindly put a bid in and never to withdraw
What it brings is what it brings is whatever when its drawn
Underlings wanting rings its like catching a reward
As far as I know, having money never did me wrong
So forgive me for the motive and exposing my exposure
""The Opener"" to me was a way of giving me closure
Told them one of one to be the one is to be lonesome
And opening the trunk was their way of turning my tone up
Y'all will get it potentially when you grow'd up
Big paws on a small pup like fuck the hold ups
I'm more for the immediate when all they see is medians
I'm over the shoulders of the norm for the deviant
I'm noted as going up beyond from the previous
Peeking through the floor of the above like where the ceiling went?
Oh, there it go, better yet, there it was
I heard whistles as much as you trying to hear the drums
So miss me with the wonderings and the whys
These Grapes wouldn't fit you, no wonder I don't reply
They say God bless the child that could hold his own
You pay blogs to hold you down, I just throw em my poems
And they Olajuwon post, I'm honored by the most
Hiding their face when they trying to find the dope

See this is just a test drive
So tell them I ain't sitting where the rest ride
Shorty say I'm whipping like I'm next right?
But I'm just trying figure out my next drive

The game's fucked up dude's beats is banging dude your hooks did it
Your lyrics didn't ya blogger look did it
So I would write it if y'all could envision
What was real from what's distilled and the good difference
But between the two of them, easy to bow out and be through with them
But realizing they still ride off of how I influence them
Made me never-mind like I'm Francis pops
Said it smell like teen spirit when you stand on my block
Aspiration, corners employed to handle hard
O's on they mind, its looking like Camden Yards
I mean, with Stoudemire's for hire to man the charge
And more of them in training just look to the handle bars
I mean, I handle bars for the broads that speak light
Made her scream to be quiet, I guess I'm Malik Wright
Am I right?
Is this what they said it would seem like?
And if so I wouldn't have wrote what I wrote by them street lights
I mean, humble pie on a plate, it's set behind me
Cause Hustle said it best I'm just better than everybody
So, what up Chi-Town, anytime that y'all out
Visiting the borough you good as long as I'm 'round
Cause I was in the Chi and y'all treated me like I was Tomahawking
With a 1 on my back for the Southside
So when we at the table and them bottles come close
Just know that that teen spirit corner deserves a toast
And I'll toast to myself if it don't seem comprehensible
Tipping my fitted to my mirror the commendable

And from then on I never had to pretend to you",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-test-drive-lyrics

I like it when we get lost
The way you go deeper
Nothing else matters more
The way you go deeper
The way you go deeper
The way you keep going deeper now

Remembering the Rest (Interlude),In Celebration of Us,2018.0,"The way his lips parted to sound my name 
Felt like song and dance
He was a musical without the accolades
I hung on every note
We performed together nightly
Starting with interludes on my jawline
He left pitches in the pit of my throat
Never did he choke on the words ""I love you""
He said it with his fingertips on my piano keys of a back 
He had a stroke not out of tune 
He knew the lyrics to the song before they were written
Our set was in production 
We could see our nomination for the ""greatest love story ever performed” 
Strum these pains with your fingers
Let it hurt a little 
I want to be in sync and sink in all that you are in all that I am
I don't want amnesty
Jailbird me
Bar me inside your rib cage
So I can rest and lie where all your secrets and desires do
To study you
Lively... nothing can make you feel more awake and dreaming than when our skin fills one another with each other's essence
We breathe 
You are a hallucinogen and I have on a gas mask
Inhale you until I can taste you like I haven't eaten all day
You satisfy a physiological need
I thought I was complete 
I didn't realize how half I was until I found you
See you make me write love poems for days
Sex poems at night 
Hate poems in the morning 
Laughter in the afternoon
And It isn't that we love
It's how we love
Little time to the human clock, but we make seconds tick like hours 
Condemn me to a lifetime of our musical
So, we can sing and dance when your lips part and sound my name
I can't remember the rest…",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-remembering-the-rest-interlude-lyrics
Sweet Pursuit,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"Uh, in my sweetest pursuit
Love is love but it never was easy to move
They tell me everything I love and I see what it do
They tell me everything I love but I need it from you
Uh, in my sweetest pursuit
Love is love but it never was easy to move
They tell me everything I love and I see what it do
They tell me everything I love but I need it from you

The more we run alone
The less we seem to move
The less we're on our own
The sweeter the pursuit

Good intentions at the root of it
Blaming us is only shaping us to keep pursuing it
Reaching for a dollar on a needle, get to looping it
Make enough to say you made enough when you was through with it
'cause none of this is what they was pointing to when we saw them
But still in all we was committed to Tryna see it
Like some of this is everything we have forever wanted
To get involved and to be living beyond reason, right?
Tryna keep it, and draw a tag on it
You know how we get it, right?, duffle bags for it
The simplicity of banking on a victory
And putting your belief in a baton as the centerpiece
But it's one of those, and it's a ton of us
So when it comes to you it comes to every one of us
Treat it all the same and all of this will be different
To see what we became is to see what they all missing
 + 

In the spirit of tug of wars where love is lost
In the crossfire and something's drawn and dumping off
Half don't make it, the other half will duck and crawl
And turn Caine tryna save who remains
Raised as a JW and so the wayI was laid
Is on a stake and not a cross, blood stains on the floor
Intuition will kick in and find a way to pry me off
I bring the stake wit me and keep it as memorabilia
Dealers is my audience, uniformed all of it
Made sense like as if I was there when they was offing it
Music for my friends, and due to my begins
I never shook the feeling of the mood that y'all was in
I never shook the feeling of the newest model Benz
But I stopped thinking that rappers and producers was my friends
'cause its a wonderful world til they cutting out the odds
And it turns out loyalty just wasn't in their cards
 + 

My pursuit is on a pace of a shooter outta state
Where the heights are getting higher til they grew up outta place
And the lights are getting brighter so you shooting by the stakes
And your aiming get erratic Tryna move em out the way
By the way, ain't a way that we can run this by ourselves
When we do it the pursuance turn the shooters outta shells
So treat it all the same and all of this will be different
To see what we became is to see what they all missing",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-sweet-pursuit-lyrics
Maintain,The Salvation,2009,"It's the end of a day
And I made it this far
But what will tomorrow, bring for me-eeeee?

Further than they ever thought
I made it this far learnin what they never taught
Fingers is permanently curved, they forever crossed
The cloud said I'm not alone if I ever walk
But it's easy to fall victim, harder to brush it off
When any dream you dreamed will probably run along
Time flies when you starin at the stars
But time dies when you clear away your heart
And fuck seein facades, none of that is payin
Neither is complainin, just thank God you made it
But what if you didn't make it? What if this whole time
Everything that you made, was a product of closed eyes
And by the time you wake, the time that you had prayed
Will still be on your side, took the time to fly away
And before you even get to reflect
The minute hands is walkin and you missin your steps
Huh, it's ironic ain't it? You could try to wait it
But there ain't enough colors for you to try to paint it
So tryin to explain it to anyone'll get 'em lost
And points don't exist if they don't ever get across
Mama said it's up to me to keep the lights on
I said ""cool, long as God keep the mics on""
I could speak the right song or sing the right poem
And I could find a way to light home

I maintain, I maintain, I maintain
I just maintain
I maintain, I maintain
As long as I could open my eyes, I maintain

The sacrificial lamb, the carrier of loads
Who showed no pain 'til he was carryin 'em home
Who showed no gain but if you added up his growth
It would show, that it was off balance from the go
And from the go, chance wasn't nothin that he knew
Nothin that he was given or nothin he could have blew
And the road was too dark that he wanted to lead
But he said he saw better when his son was asleep
So he starts footsteppin and he saw another set
On the right and then he saw another on the left
And every night, he's judgin off a coin toss
Clearin the way so that nothin throw the coin off
When a decision is decided, he's either tryin to hide it
Or lookin for somebody that he could ride with
Slow breathin, goin for evens tryin to break the odds
So close to a murder he could taste the charge
But, people's lives depended on what he scribes
So now his pen move differently and in time
The pad may fill but the pen'll never drive
So as long as there's a wall, he could penmanship his mind
It sort of like coppin
You only get half of what you wanted when you asked but you can't seem
To stop it
I told 'em it's just the problems we face
Sittin on a stoop, starin up at God everyday
But I felt like I was talkin to someone who couldn't hear me
Until I looked up and I saw that the one near me
Who was lookin for advice was in common
I just wasn't lookin at 'em right and his problems
Was similar, too similar, way too familiar
Lookin into his eyes, was lookin into a mirror
Tryin not to break it, along with who I be
Saw that the whole time I was arguin with me (*echo*)

Well me too ma

True to that
You addicted to all them expensive purses
But all that you puttin' in them
Makes all them expenses worth it
Like puttin' my number in it
And holdin' it till you learn it
Ya iPod loaded with all of my vintage verses
Well I can offer you all that you been deservin'
And baby I'm as honest as all of my literature is
If you really a fan then you know how my literature gets
With the moral being I'm giving you bigger purpose
Like you was nervous
But it was worth it
Shows over for whoever
Shit is curtains
And when you learned it
And it was perfect
Trynna explain but can't find where the words is

I can see you like it lavish
Designer eyes, imported fabrics
Look no more I'll match ya talent
Girl for sure we lust for magic
C'mon c'mon c'mon
I'll be your expensive habit
Let's turn this lust to magic
Baby yea

BBM days and Pino nights
Spare kicks under the bed

Baby fly guy etiquette
We know life
Tell ya girls anything
Tell em' ""he go right""

Tell em' that everything you imagined
Was done on the first so the second was more added
Lyrics come to life
You lay and become a addict
Keep ya Jimmy Choo's on
Yea ya glasses

Knew that if you drought that
I can flood gate it and awaken what's around that
I can runway what you playin' where the crowds at
I can one-take it like I'm makin' you the soundtrack
You can turn serenade
Next door hear the play
Melo in the mourn
Turn it up and let them hear the game
Drown that up under you
Surround sound cover you
And this is a Bose
So you can sing how you wanna boo


The perfect playlist
Could call out the day shift
You need a day to get back in touch with ya basics
You a Morris and all that you went away with
Is comin' back to you now fuck it embrace it
And when you hold it
You fiendin' to let me know it
Lookin' for reasons like you really need a motive
At 7:25
You wake up and touch ya thigh

Well baby I'm not surprised

Falling Out The Sky,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"Swear the only thing that I wanted
Was for you to know that I did it like nobody done it
Then say I did it again and did it a third time
And know that the third time was the trinity coming
Coming up from a section where everyone is gunning for the exit
Until it's roped off like heroin
Can't say they caught me on the ropes
Nor can they ever say they talked me into hope
My hope was tucked under my know how, know how?
Made it the way I know, PLO style
So one time for the Method I chose
And if you tied those together then I'm guessing you home
And home is same kind that I grew up all around
Still uniformed down so I'm never alone, nah
But shit it felt like it on my entry
So counting takes forever, you dig me?, falling out the sky

Saw money falling out the sky
Reached up for it and just wanted a reply
Reached up for it and was caught up in the high
And then came down off the ride
Falling out the sky
Saw money falling out the sky
Reached up for it and just wanted a reply
Reached up for it and was caught up in the high
And then came down off the ride
Falling out the sky

One of one like a first born, out of the aim of the first drawn
Couple shoulders couldn't duck it, now my shoulders being covered
By them shoulders up above us like I work for 'em
Maybe I do, or rather I did, if I should bid adieu
The way it seems I've been signaled to move
Never moved like the rest, had to whip on my own
Couldn't move like the rest, I got mirrors at home, I'm sorry
Built on integrity first and the motto to get the money was the 2nd we learned
When you are who you are then your part don't change
And my name really my name like I'm Marlo made, and yet
The most doubted was the most about it
And he put it up where you could pull the most up out it, and yet
I tell 'em be that as it may, forgive me for leaving with my name
While they're falling out the sky


So if this is the last thing that you hear
Take to it how it is same way it appears
Take to it how it is same way that it was
And know that what we was looking at became a mirage
But still, regardless of the way it concur
For the Flip, just know they can't erase what we were, right?
Couple dreams that were cushioned by the bread
I broke mine to know that we fed, falling out the sky",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-falling-out-the-sky-lyrics
You & Me,Cloud 9: The 3 Day High,2006.0,"I pour it out
I pour it out
I unzipped my heart and I pour it out
 (x2)
You and me were meant huh
Do a little something together
Figured you know
Kick it to you in verse form
Instead of kicking it to you in person

To start it off ma
Am at a crossroads
Cause I ain't sure which way that this is gonna go
See on one hand it seems so positive
Then on the other am lost but then the opposite
Far from a sucker for love
But I kinda adore you
Knew it the munite I first saw you
Started with a couple of plugs
Then you started to fall through
Couple days a week it was all you
Then you caught feelings and I caught feelings
We got scared like am I supposed to feel this
But you and me were meant huh
To be together in the best way
We can't live life wondering about the next day
But you don't how scared I am
To let you get next to Sky
You don't know the stress that I remember
But still in all you looking like you the best in line
So maybe you the best to Sky's contenders
Cause in the past when they spaz
Sky would dip em
And that's why I think twice when you kiss me
At the same time any night I want you with me

You and me were meant, uh, to be together, and I know you scared, ma
But ain't nothing wrong with taking it there, ma
And I'm just as nervous as you
But if anybody's worth it, it's you... and me
Keep pouring it, keep pouring it!

They say the first two weeks consist of the most smiles
Tryna get to know your curves and profile
And every little thing you did I took notice
Remembering the shit that I said to get you open
Just so I can say it again to keep you right here
And eventually leading to your night wear
You was playing good girl but you gave in
I redecorated your walls and they caved in
I took care of them dreams you was saving
Day by day by day
Even outside the sheets we was kinda complete
Just as long you was riding with me
I felt something like down South cook food
And you too you was coat check hook boo
Lets just say we was both sprung cool
Then we started to care a little more
I can hear your heart beating clear when you talk
And all the above are signs of a relationship
And I ain't even meant to take this trip

Keep pourin it
Keep pourin it
But now we known each other long enough
But am still not sure what to call us
Can't tell if what we feel is strong enough
But I know when am with you its all us",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-you-and-me-lyrics

Cause for the win I'm leaving everyone to here to witness
But then again I'm seeing everyone in here with visions
They too vivid so I'm here till no one here is living
The way I ease up and dig her out we up and get em down
Gotta lean witnesses cause my sneakers be sticking out
Why leave em to pick me out, in it before it starts
Ripping the floor apart, then we be out
Call it 'Inheritance' part 2
Inherited off stoops
Got up off of them to see what the rest of the heart do
I'm leaving scenes without a speaker left
No one here to speak a breath
My bitch be a Vivica, bag right, squeeze her left
I mean we ain't living up, flash lights, we be next
D's be running up and down my ave like a CVS
Promise all I want it to be promised this is worth it
Couple rags duffel bags ain't no reason we ain't working
Couple rags duffel bags shorty be it from the surface
Telling me she up for that like hopefully it be a Birkin
And now she singing murder deals trying to murder heels
Pray before we spray them and hope they work for real
Call it F.G.R

First Generation Rich
Hands digging in this bag trying to make it stick
F.G.R., First Generation Rich
I be the first and the last if I can stay with this, F.G.R
We all trying to get it (x3) like really who you kidding?
We all trying to get it (x3) and hit the floor with it

We all trying to get it (x3) and hit the floor with it
And call it F.G.R

As much as I wanted to be Theo
My day ones was more J.J
And I'm from out of Brooklyn like I'm Dwayne Wayne or like Theo
But my focus became about payday
So we on the same page
We reading the same line
And I'm trying to change a page
But she trying to take her time
Like baby if they got a surveillance then I should be at a 10
Let em see a bad bitch before I squeeze in the lanes
Love her, black glover, bra big, waist small
Draw attention and get to drawing away starve
And may y'all be in ya best grace
Or be by the next safe while we screaming checkmate
Check mate, and checks may need IDs, so cash us
Swear that I don't mean no harm or close caskets
But this is integrity as been at a level 3
So now I'm trying to lower something down respectfully
Respect what the money is, trying detail where the money was
And own the keys from where the money is
Pillow talking to a pillow
Knowing it needs to happen but none of it probably will though

My Interpretation,The Salvation,2009.0,"(Excuse me as I kiss the sky)

Ridin on the wings of a dollar bill
Or better yet the anticipation of how it feels
Yeah, I guess I'm ridin on that
Caught a flight here and I ain't tryin to fly back
Nah, I held hands with the other side
And not afraid to still stand where the others hide
I foresee my afflictions in it
With no missed beginnings and no plans of tryin to kick this itchin
Nah, see the feeling is too strong to leave 'lone
The young board is too far to leap from
The conversation is too crafted for me
For me to believe this is somethin that can come and harm me
Easy for me, I mean, I follow the aroma
And the aura of what it might be is bringin me closer
Higher than I've ever been, caught it while catchin it
And tryin to keep it caught takes precedence
My interpretation
 - w/ ad libs
Never knew a feeling like this
Feelin like the feeling's priceless
I know what I need, I know what I want
I know where I've been, I know where I'm goin
My interpretation
Never knew a feeling like this
Feelin like the feeling's priceless
And all that I need and all that I want
Is to leave where I be and get where I'm goin
My intepretation

For everybody watchin me from the other side
I'm two smiles from every one time you wanna cry
I can't call it and yeah even though I'm all for it
It's underneath me, I walk on it
Meanin I control what starts and stops
And I can start and stop whenever needed, so I'm far from got
It's the allure of sittin between it all
Hands on the steering wheel, gettin me across
First time's a charm, the first time is gone
As quick as it came, so the chicks is leadin on
And I can't describe every time that I rise
But the further I go up, the more I wanna fly
And the limits don't seem to be around
So if you see me now, you see that I ain't tryin to see the ground
But I can come down whenever is necessary
No worries, you don't gotta hear me
It's my interpretation
 - w/ ad libs

You get your wings on your first taste
Fly away from everything on your first chase
Can't deny what it brings when it first breaks
So how could you ever think that this would turn great?
You see the lines get blurred the more that you partake
Followin a curve, the more that you walk straight
Attached at the waist so everything that you need
Is at the other end of everywhere that you be
And you sittin on E but denial is enough
To ignite and rile somethin up
And all that you want is letter H, letter O, letter P
And it seems at the bottom of it all is letter E
Let it breathe, is the feeling you receive
Roll down your pride and peel up your believes
Roll down your eyes and peel up on your sleeve
Inhale and feel it underneath

Or stirrin upstairs with a stop watch in the kitchen
Followin the minute hand

Good block, ain't nobody similar at all for a minute
So should of get the click until it's gone if you with it
Get it from when it sizzle to it yawn in a scrimmage
Coffee cup early in the morn' with the business
So fuck if you slow, money never waits

Fast money, it really ain't that hard

And a set of loose lips if ever you ever hide
And everything that's should is residin that far
And everything that good is right in your backyard
And everything that kills is typin you back hard

For Real(er),Peddler Themes,2017.0,"Stop fucking around and be a man
You either can be stuck underground or flee the land
Like you can be the one in the ride who lead the band
Or you can be the one on the line who need a gram
Do it how they taught you on the records they brought you
Your hero said he'd run outta town on Peter Pans
Cool, all that resonates and all that dedicates til you outside and you see the vans
I rolls on the loop with everything we about
'cause circles can't fit no squares, it keeps em out
Looped in off what the stoop is
Where the pound talk is treys like Lupin
Un-markeds side by side where the coupe is
They c'est la vie the next Trayvon shooting
I'm back to my brick in the booth shit, my vocab paraphernalia
I float around the track like Mahalia
Back for the braillers, know that they drag you when you gone like you playing for Baylor
That's word to a Dennehy, and words to remember me
You know it's either that or you turn to a memory
You are who you are, you can't turn on your tendencies
Prove it when we call something over, ven aqui
Truck jewels while the truck move, caught it right off the deck
Til' they strip it and call it quality of life arrests

It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer
It gets for real, and then it gets for realer
Like jumping out the deck and the tape all killer

They say it's like that, money entice that
The celebration is waiting like ""where the lights at?""
I made a way out the gate and ain't have to hype that
I put my name on a plate and they couldn't price that
I seen cops get lower than where the night's at
I seen dice turn over and push a life back
I sent dough in the mail like where the kites at?
They make your bro switch cells before you write back
But shit it's like that, nothing else like this
Did it alone so I don't know what the hype is
And when it's like this and po-9 peruse by me
I treat em like if all of em think that they're Giuliani
Said they got a reason to see what the aim like
I trained with my left 'cause I knew they would play me right
7 days 7 nights while the 7 is upon us
Que up the God number like Melo in the corner
Taught us our fathers to the heavens that adorn us
Caught us star gazing at the bezels that was on us
Pat your own self on the shoulders
Or mask on, put your name up like Quinones
OG told us how he blew dollars rights before the lick hit
Take 'em back, blue collar '94 Knicks shit, it's like that
Money entice that, the celebration is waiting like ""where the likes at?""

It gets for real, and then it gets for realer

It gets for real, and then it gets for realer

Doors off baby hold all your gold

The doubles the only logic baby, low and behold
Roof tucked, wings up like it's flown off the stove, let it fly

For The Sleepers,The Great Debater,2011.0,"The revisit of “For The Awake”
For all of them who seems to listen for long as it take
And all of them that seem to get it
And all of its traits
And never wanted me to differ or lower the stakes
I covered y’all on the before
Called for a detour
Time-time on the dash
But pardon if I reach off
Draw songs for the stash
And offer them to see raw
Eyes wide shut like the barbers on the Seymore
Call it like it be called or better yet wasn’t
Visionary beyond, but never left from it, the loneliest
Leroy Campbell when I Crayola this
, the loneliest
Paint staircases like a custodian
Kyrlon’d over them,
 
drawn my soliloquy
I Rain Man’d so none of them couldn’t mimic me
Jesus Christo forgive me for the interludes
I’m trying to get them to know what they wasn’t meant to knew
The past tense, the miss scenes we didn’t shoot
You asked them how missed me when I did for you
So forgive me for doing for I
And if you can’t, then fuck it I ain’t too much surprised
Respects showed me I’m designed to play the stand up part
The vets told me I could sell mine on grandpa’s art
But the hearts wasn’t out enough
Arms got the rounding up
Maybe they alarm wasn’t loud enough

So this is for the sleepers
The hard to be believers
Who couldn’t understand

Floor Seats With Young,Band Practice,2013.0,"Living better at the thought of living better
Living is carpe diem so I'm caught in this forever
The smell of YSL over teddy bear sweaters
Know when I got one on I never zip up my leather
Never did this to catch them, they wanted to catch me
Said I wrote like I have yet to know what a rap be
Meaning it's deeper than rap if you ask me
Or the subjects of the stories I told where the track be
Two classics and rolling on lap 3
My whip was 2 doors I drove from the back seat
I did it like who's y'all and know that on lap 3
I'm still clueless to y'all but I know where the track leads
Meaning all I see is lane and opportunity
Lil road kill, ID 'em by they jewelry
Know the flow still got 'em leaning out the coupe with me
Like ""son, do you hear what he saying, I mean truthfully""
Truthfully I'm just waiting for this to pass
This 5 year plan that I gave 'em is in the bag
The bag got monograms on it if you ask
And a space jam glow if you open it and grab
Just a dude from Brooklyn who had intentions
Of hoping that Jay is watching and saying ""Yeah, he gets it""
But hoping that Jay is watching is double edged and twisted
Like, ""Yeah, I'm still a fan but now I'm within the business""
The blinders is on but I get the urge lift 'em
I peak and leave it there, I out-swerve collisions
My peak is still in there, I'm nowhere in reach of it
Yet I sound like its a throne here that I'm leaning in
Critics say that my destiny's that guy
I'm just here to tell a story, if I ever sit that high
Then I'm playing follow the leader, applaud that as a given
Like ""I don't fuck with the nets but damn I fuck with his vision""
And I never been a follower but if I do follow
It'll be a 600 mill leader and a few bottles
My fan base is double knotted like an ascot
Half of 'em got degrees, half of 'em got stash spots
Half of 'em strip and half is contemplating
I see your vision mama
I put my money on the long shot, treat it like you Caine and Dog
With no prints to be rinsed and no names to recall
I mean, we out here in grind mode, caught up in a paper chase
I wanna fuck a fine ho and front row the fade aways
Madison square
Or Barclays whenever the boys from Madison Square is passing thru there
I'm in a blue and orange state, its only apathy here
I was raised on them colors, Jigga, that should be fair
But I still lift my hat at the achievement
Only it's blue and orange letters where the team is
If we can get past that and between this, uh, then this baton will be easy for me to leave with
Floor seat, suede Timbs where my feets is
Raised on what he wrote and who my team is...

I'm tryna get these floor seats wit young
Prolly make me take my hat off cause my team just won
Videos wit Spike Lee and my sneaks is dumb
Records wit Jill Scott, and if you be where I'm from that means the world",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-floor-seats-with-young-lyrics
Ever Loyal,Theo vs J.J. (Dreams vs. Reality),2012.0,"Ever loyal
Skating from Mrs. Westlake, but she bad
I should be laying with Mrs. Westlake, and we had
Copies of Shakespeare on vinyl
Magic Johnson posters but blue and orange idols
And through all of these haiku's
I'm back on my Michael
Which ever one, between '89 and '98
Providing it by the day and driven by being driven
Inspired to drive away in cars with less room
Either that or getting picked up in cars with stretched roofs
Where the only thing that's not in the car is the restroom
Cause when Jada said his car had everything but a bar
It inspired me to want refrigerators in the arm-rest
First half of the calm yet
Meaning that the storm should be coming like a cartridge blowing
Double meaning
Shit, to know him is to be him
Either that or at least see him
And he usually be at Farmer in the deli if you need him
You can tell him by his sneakers
Never tied and never kinds you can find in the retail
Fiends get excited outside when they see Mel
Meaning that the sneakers are shipping in
And whatever pair I got on I'll probably give to them
Stringing these together through loops like where the symbol is
If you could walk a day in my shoes then you can sit with them
That was kind of high, pardon me for throwing that up
I assumed that you would've knew and followed through with some backup
But my pocket is gorgeous like Lolo Jones
So even if you couldn't catch it you could go off flows, right?
Gordon Gartrells
 and Creed cologne
It cost a bottle a Spade, shit to each is own
I smell amazing

The Experience,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"Smothered chicken as far as breakfast goes
Shout out to the left overs that left us those
Cheese grits like a remix how we stretching those
In 9th grade Pierre would keep his weapon close
I still treat breakfast the same, my friends still catch wreck with their aim
I'm still henny and coke, and speaking of
We was surrounded by it
And ducking all the jewels from the users on that diet
And we ain't have the heart to try it but saw the brave ones
And looked at that as a jewel on how they became one
We all shared last names with them same ones
And Penny's where I learned my J from, I'm built how I'm built
Solo artist but I never had to sing alone
The scent Creed and the Timbs is never single sole
The whip was low enough for me to be low
But loud enough for you to be in the know
Know we salute to the experience

We were the loud ones with quiet souls
Intentions well and good but buried underneath over pricing
We wanted nothing more than everything, simply everything
Whatever that entails, we wanted it and still do
Still do we never sit still, as being settle is being settled
And we could never became that
And never will

Grew up with a bunch of Lenny Cooke's
May God bless 'em all like a Biggie hook
They hooked us early as far as the way these women look
And looking for 'em had us looking for a bigger push
Call it the laws of attraction baby
It's nothing more than a reaction baby, we push this to get you
Whatever ""this"" is, as long as what it gets is
All that we assumed but shit you know the way that ""this"" fits
In square trucks Tryna bring a couple models 'round
The same ones who brought your bottles down
I bottled up the ambition and passed it around the room
Til half us around the room know the logic now
And all of us ain't see the vision so some of us got left behind
But nothing could yet divide us from our calling now
Like how the call to the corner was as sweet as quarter water
All for you to wanna climb up on us now
Salute to the experience

Sweeter than sweet potato soufflé
Store runs for extra sugar and those runs showed us
More than those who sent us ever would've
Or as sweet as a scam that left our finger prints dirty
But our sneakers clean and our company cleaner
The taste of life in all its glory
Be it Harvard or heinous, we took it where none would take it
And poured Henny over it's glory

Back when me and Biz played the coupe
He showed me the lane, I showed him stoops
We showed each other money, and loyalty be everything it seems to
So lil Biz will be straight if you ever need dude
The same agenda applies to all of my friends who
Saw that coinciding was nothing coincidental
Never, it's just the way we're put together
And none of this shit could be any better
Salute to experience

A generation generating genius
Hard headed like the curb beneath us
They say in the absence of logic you search for motive
But really motive defines us based on being aware of logic
And aware of the dollars and yea ""mo' money mo' problems""
But no money no options, see the logic?
And for that, we salute to the experience",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-experience-lyrics
Phone Calls,Band Practice,2013,"On a winner's roll, for how the winners go
My life is a ""3 piece-free dinner roll""
I'm writing to see the seams where the middle's sewn
And rightfully be a fiend for a bigger stone
The irony in my neighbors feeling the same
How I'm looking for baguettes and they waiting to get a trade
Hoping it's 80-20, it's more 40-60
They can paint you the world when the talk is all whiskey
I'm in the same vision
They blind enough to let us
So if diamonds is forever
Then why not just chase prisms?
The hoodie black and the 'Brons is grey Prisms
The goal is to leave with your hearts and grey brim 'em
I'm dating all the broads they hiring for they vids
The money they paying them is the bottles that's in my crib
Encouraged to stay with em, but yo, I just be on my shit
Dying for the moment is dying enough to live
For the record, as true as the truest is
The dudes I grew up with is the dudes that's doing bids
So, with no big brother stretching his arm
Swear to God my co-sign is where the peddlers are
I mean, thirteen, writing rhymes on the step
Looking for a metronome and only sirens was left
So the verse was to the horn
And working in a song
Had me jumping to a trumpet full circle all along
And when them horns blow, they play what the vibe be
If motherfuckers wait, you'll be waiting to find reach
I mean, they said my mother got cancer in her breast
And my pops got cancer in his neck
It turned out my mother is straight, but my pops ain't as blessed
So he at a cancer center trying to rest
I pray to God the money I'm chasing is at least worth the journey
And the ones who lose lane is the ones who was trying to murk me
Cause good aim will have them hanging your jersey
Like, ""Son had good game, it's a shame to hang it early""
Early to the money and missing a phone call
I hope when I call back and get him, I don't bawl
Ivy League mind full of prodigal thoughts
And when he was fathering me, I was fathering y'all
One time..
One time for the phone call
Hoping when I call back, I don't bawl",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-phone-calls-lyrics
Get Him To The Greek,The Great Debater,2011.0,"She said to me Sky, life is for living
I get right to the living before the light of my ending shows
She said to me Sky, life is for living
I get right to the living before the light of my ending goes
Get him to the greek (x3)
Meaning me, I'll get me there
Get him to the greek (x3)
Meaning me

Any windows of middle men in between
Littering through the dreams of trying to get from this Z to this A
In them windows I'm literally on the lean
If I get to be seen I'm slipping up on my dean for this pay
I don't need no eyes to see no stride that we bow tied
So I'm hoping you closed yours if I should speak so wide
I hope you know the allure and why it seems so high
And I'm hoping that closed door behind me don't pry
I mean the booth is all I'm looking for
You and yours I look towards
Trying to build a bridge that I could uniform to push us off
Know me off a homie but to know me is to look beyond
Only for the lonely so I'm lonely if you put me on
Itching while I'm waiting patiently I'm impatient
But my mannerisms tell you I may be the one to trade with
Tell them I'll be back tomorrow my briefcase on the table
You can keep it, its more where they came from
If you play it, I mean


As I play the bench after this chess move is properly made
I see the middle disappearing if I lock this today
I see that middle interference that was blocking my lane
But coming clearly incoherent, they done dropped out the way
I mean I'm clearly in the clear, shake a hand out in this park
And I can hear what they don't hear so if you hear me where to start
Then I'll be there to play the rear, take a stand and say remarks
I won't remember a name, place my hand upon my heart
If underhanding is an art, you tell them I'm Kenneth Gatewood
But the forbidden innocence isn't anything they should reflect on
Or worry yourselves worries don't sell
If a word is to be uttered then we should worry for real
But in the mean time, we've lined ourselves with rewinds
Meaning I'm back as soon as I leave cause these fly
Meaning I'm back to pursing my lea, I see eye to eye with you
The mattress seem logical, but my sleep differ


Parallel to the she in question
And based on how she be dressing
I made this an easy catch and ironically
I'm caught in the same G I threw, lost between me and you
Call it the sweet pursue, but I'm trying to leave
And that I was hoping wouldn't pry
Is kissing my shoulders as I pushed to the other side
She kissing my motives as I'm looking under her eyes
I kissed her like fuck it
As long as I'm still alive, I'll do this to death

For The Awake,The Great Debater,2011.0,"The revisited “The Don Cheadle Effect”
And the awards given off to the floor seats of the ‘jects
And them awards given off for seeing respect
To them all that’s involved that call me they connect
To the wall they was on the four seats of them steps
That’s beyond where that wall is drawing me to be next
So I talk what I talked and y’all seem to be left
They was lost and I crossed and all they see is a X
My honesty in a Tec in the hands of Ilena’s cousin
Yo mouth screaming to “duck”
While you be leaking from it
See all I be is the tuck, so if you keep me from it
They don’t need what they want or what they need is wanted
And wanting it lowered and trying talk them to know it
Cut the K and the W and maybe I shouldn’t throw this
Cut the K get a W I just toss them a notice
Let it play until it stuck and then you become the awoken
 (x2)
This is for the awake
Call it quarter to 8
Whatever they desired, I put it all on their plate
What ever I would scribe they take it all for the day
We on the same line as long as that line pays

This for the awake, first viewing of the body
Before the funeral numero uno with the shotty
Who could part this
Thank you for your listening and under-standing
Reprimanding when you was up in ya lunches
Arguing with niggas on ya solo against bunches
About Nas when they ain’t understanding his punches
Pizza getting cold you ain’t worried cause these dunces
Never stomached the real, it’s terrible that they crunches
Homie I be kicking the real, like Brazil
Without the ‘Z’ giving people something to feel
On every 1st listen they never knew nothing as ill
Because I’m king, they be Bishop like they running with Steele
Uh, let me get ya bitch that be something to kill
While I maneuver through the game and I’m getting my bills
Over saturation of rappers but we giving them skills
Through the flood they see the real
Niggas spitting with gills
 (x2)

When the comforter is in the same fold
It was in when you first left hearing them same clothes
And in the end you’ll be tying together to make bose
Get wind of when riding along to the same tone
Shit dims, lights get lower than save modes
And them rims on the tires is wired with payroll
But then again, if you ain’t get to touch that bed
Then you caught when I was running when I said

A lil' more on the edge, they was lookin for less
Used to the tap, they was lookin for steps
I don't juice none of that, they mistook it for meds
The root is under that just say I shook off the reds

Up to where I'm backed by
Everyone you homage so I'm cutting through the back ties

Truthfully my pen ain't been the same since Stack died
That might be another reason to react, like
That might be enough to see if they see that line
Pack mines see it through the seams and what the scratch like
Act right see if you can see what the collapse like
Wonder rap, hovercraft, 
Sky fly effortless
Fuck around and sit on top of Mozgov neck with it
Blake shit, makeshift, ladder that I can step upon
Rap nerds get to shooting at him like they Meadowlark
That serves that the truth is at 'em but they never caught
That curve, get to shooting back like they could wet a blog
That merged just to proven that I'm what they never saw
Smell it through the bag, baby that's how we be peddling

And they don't rap like me, and that might be
The curse of all cursive, rap by the tree
And the perfect beyond perfect, if that's what it be
Then I word it beyond worded, I'm back to what it be

Blue and orange everything, clearly what I'm repping
And the pressure that come with it like I'm wearing number seven
So I'm 39-10 if you should dare to disrespect it
Good money from the corner, put your ear to where the net is
Good money from the corner, put your ear to where the net is
Three meanings at once, and should clearly try to catch it

No clone drew up like
No Brook and Robin Lopez, no two alike
See the arm, see that ya'll crown him for you see his song
Prematures need applause I just need a Nia Long
See the R, see the god, see that where they seek the god
Swear I leave the beat alone if I could be with Nia Long

Twenty stories tall

Letters on the draw

And a yellow for the star
Use that for the awning
Save some for the morning
Put it above the buildings
But shade it to show the dawning
White tee corners with blue and whites upon 'em
Brown paper stash in grey sewers support 'em
Purple tops is down
Purple pouches are crown
Black leather Bibles, gold robes and gowns
Green and white dice games
Charcoal calibers
Silver hops out and burgundy the parameter
Running through burgundy cans
I can't keep one
Try painting that high up
But I can't see none
Red and black J-O's
Hands on the payroll
Stephen Strasburg your curve
Let a base load
Navy blue rent-a-car
Trunk pop, lift it off
Black duffle bag
White K's, clear signatures
Huh, marathons when the signals drawn
Green Newport boxes could make a finger tug
No innocence turns to more innocence
Paint it yay high
And see if it grows into it
Still trying to find the colors of how the growth looks
Black and white marble color notebooks

Something like IZ, something like SLAY
Something like SEEN, something like Quiñones

Locked on whatever, like whatever he should ever do

Dark blue for the Dereons that she curved in
Purple sidekick, fly bitch on her home screen
Tanned Gucci bag off of everything a blow be
Fifty for the wop, a hundred for the walls
Saying fifty's a lot, but her tongue is like an applause
And money right from the door knew what it was gon be
She hit him with what it'd cost
He hit her with all he need
Black for the Mag box
, tickling her stash spot
Grinning off the image, said the 
pussy like a padlock
Beige for the unroll
Shorty told him pump slow and she could take it from there
Sweet dreams, drumroll
Duke said ""nah,"" and started spazzing in her hips
Hands on her throat, went savage off the rip
Red for the way the room looked when her eyes closed

Pull these out the air, grab a pair let this go for me
Tying these together like I'm roping these
Getting to the point, like it's dope in these
Picture what this dope could be
Diddy bopping like if Diddy out here on the road with me
Diddy bopping like if this Ciroc is about to open me
Let it open shorty first, keep a couple close to me
Me alone and a pair of Js from when he was on
Saturdays at twelve repping Pro Stars these is those
Those is all they looking for
Look for me to look beyond
Imitation's flattery that explains them looking on
Bass sound something like a tre pound
Enough women here to have you wondering if Trey 'round
May ya'll mingle long enough to live a life and stay around
Drinking long enough if this your type cause we be like

Trying to get this going for the evening
You standing on the couch like you want me to see your secret
Drink whatever you want, double fist if you need it
As long as you ain't spilling none of that shit on my sneakers
For real

For 2012 the only MC with a flu
In Jordan 12s, see me how I'm keeping these Flu's
Know the story well, know what we on it like
Camera phones everywhere, I promise you saw the hype
Know what we call it like, living for cargo
Christopher Kane hoodies, shit is two car notes
Shit that you all know but some of you might not
Black-out Louie belts, corners is white hot

Civilized Leisure,Music For My Friends,2015.0,"Alife hoodies for when the wind move
A lifestyle like no other how you want it
When you jumping out your covers then you cover what you're into
And pray to whoever you praise that you live through
Living for the light til the light becomes a signal
And signals to you as the one to empty a clip to
Then it turns round like the signals on the dial
And the lights hop up outta nowhere like they the cymbals
Cue 'em, and watch 'em get to moving like a heart rate
Looking for a dimmer, 
get to cooking all winter
And you looking more Blizzard and this turns into a bar raid
""aight everybody, strip and get your your arms raised!""
Check day jumping, chest plate thumping
Freestyle to it, don't a neck brace want it
Soundtrack to the shooter, the soundtrack to it
The background music how the background do us
For the civilized leisure

This leisure needs to be civilized
Gotta have it, its already mine
Its already ours, its already ours

And it appears, the scent is in the air
The smell of Rosè and a nickel plated glare
The bezè rotates while the middle make 'em stare
Heavy on the bass, let it kick away your fears
Heavy on the bass like the symbolism there
There like a cling on, fear like the ring on
That's left to the left of the fears that you swing on
Fall up outta pocket like the cymbal isn't there
Cue 'em, and let 'em find lane like the plug
And it u­turns to a pillow case and a rug
And the truth turns to the middle lane being plugged
And you dealing with the outskirts, spilling like a outburst
The doors shut and they forget to let you out first
The trap literally jumping and you stuck in
Being everything you saw when you wanted even more
And you think of how the lights wasn't bright enough at all
For the civilized leisure


They say ""Sky your story don't ever change up""
It never will, it's everything that I say it was
Forever will be centered on how we came up
On Tryna be in the center of where the cake be
They told us keep it the same and if the cake leave
Make the loyalty stay and let your name breathe
May whoever's beside me have the same speed
Civilized where the leisure can take me

Look What We Have Here,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Theodore Aloysius Huxtable
Deleted the drums, so as we have begun
The content is raw enough to take the beat where you want
Amen to the speakers and the piece in the trunk
Understand both sides, shit I'm even from jump
Never blamed, I just leveled the lane
And took whatever remains
To push whatever you need to be done
Made 'em rep for where they wouldn't ever seem to be from
Let 'em play the car in back like a seat in the front
I saw it all with a Theo glare
Wrote my keynote here
In Dyslexic, reverse how I see those there
Cause for us, loud money couldn't be more clear
Chest poking, I mean we only repo scared
No backsies
Know what it took us to get to have these
Die before we give that time back, exactly
Rap be, sort of my way of becoming Clifford
And if he was still alive, my biggest fan would be Ennis
10 Stigwood living, tickets to Dance Mania
They hired working a textbook, fan framing us
Gee and Maxine Kirkwood to campaign with us
And Lana Herman, both of 'em sorta perfect
Became the kid with the vision that started blurring
And everyone around him and wit him was Carter working
So now I'm trying to feel my way around
In corner stores asking how it feel to take the crown
I was feeling weighted down and didn't know
Same gray bottoms started giving a bigger glow
I ain't ask for it, baby, I was just penning, yo
And saw a little room and was hoping to get a go
 (x2)
Look what we have here
Look how it turnt out
Never saw it coming, I was just 'bout to turn 'round
Leave it up to me, and we'll be here for keeps
Crown us if you want, but we just here to eat

They got a long way to go, cuz when they talk
It's like I gotta lean to the side just to listen to em
But they talking outta the side of they mouth
Let me put them on a S.K special yo

Peep it
Another beautiful day where the cement is
Liquor stores, twistin' raw those is prefixes
I know the corner like my sneaker size
So when you speak of the curb, it's like you speak of Sky
You see me ride on my H.O.P like ma mother name me HIP
So you can't show me nothing about making a flip
I was born with it, sorta like I was drawn with it
So I'm gon' get it in the heart of the stone with it
I'm a broad difference
But now or laters and blue juice
Barbecue sunflower seeds and fruit loops
Live from the 718 to the death of this
Marry the code, I propose and she excepted it
As far as the MIC, I does this in my sleep
I pen a song before you get on beat... word
They only hatin' cuz they wantin‘ to be us
And the way I'm on the drum is like I'm fuckin' the speakers
Hear me out

I made one plan and stuck with it
This shit is like a lay up, fam, it's automatic
I treat it like a straight up gram you all addicts
Addicted to the leaning on the curb
16 so mean, got 'em leaning on the words
Its nothing you can do to Sky
I put my heart in the badge, you see the fluid line? Look closer
You don't wanna get involved
If the corner had a logo it would be me, Yankee fitted on
Burner bulging out on the waist cuz slippin up is all that it takes
I'm not Tom, but I own my space, forrealer
The city's favorite ghetto celebrity
Never learned swagger I inherit the recipe the recipe
Still living up that expensive wardrobe shit
And living it too, it makes y'all sick

Individual, subliminal, criminal conscious
Makin' me numb how I'm stealin' the shine is
Defined as stupendous
Torae spittin' with splendedness
So my sentence is like a syllabus to the listeners
+Git It Done+, got it done
Got 'em a lot of runs
We plotted on how to double back with a hotter one
Nigga I'm New York ground
Been holdin' New York down
With the creator of the New York sound
And there can never be another or a new version of nothin'
Niggas must of forgot where it started
Primo they buggin'
It's more of the future, less of what you used ta
Whoever feel hip hop is dead, here's a booster
With no cables or battery pack
So everybody lovin' the city, we glad that we back
You should sit down and listen to what the game's been missin'
Cause +Reprogram+ was my +Redefinition+
I guess Chairman's Choice was just the beginnin'
Cause I'm the one to XXL for every sentence
I read every blog, every article printed
I heard every bar, every rhyme you was pennin'
I felt all the hate and the love
You niggas fake as a fuck
You want my spot nigga? Take it in blood

The second coming of the shit that you fear
The first time they was callin' it luck
But low and behold I'm still in ya ear
See the difference is here
So keep that in your mind
When you rhymin' and you thinkin' bout leanin' on lyin'
Scrap whatever you thought and what you wanted to think
I attack your spot the minute that you fuck up and blink
Motivated by a Kennedy Fried, tropical fantasies

Deal with it
And through all that, I'm still with it

I'm numb now cause all along what I'm givin you
Is more than you imagined any ballpoint pen could do
All and all minimal, I ain't roll a sleeve yet
Breath of fresh air and I ain't breathe yet
Third lap around and I ain't leave yet
If I talk different or it come across different, all it is is just a reflex
Pardon that, I expect 'em to miss a part of that
Four car lane to explain where my margin at
Four parts weighed and one part raw
And even that's over the scale, take one part off
Assumin you used to it, I ain't cut it the same
I double back, recut it and then cut it again
My hands dirty off the way that I waiter, we don't cater alike
My blog anything that I write (let's go)

I made mine to coincide with how you see music
Content mirrors whatever you be music
Still up under the honor when I conceive music
The first caller to call it and work morning to morning
From off the start of his calling and took a lead to it
And I'm only followin to follow through
So if I'm knockin from the bottom then I'm by the roof
Growth spurt probably, all they ever got from me
Is step stools that I threw down for them to follow me
Next move, I move 'round for they apologies
Opposite of hear me now, guess I'm out of reach
I be on another note, hoverin above a quote
Still only curt with the words that I ain't touch or wrote
And they still couldn't corner me yet

Ticker Tape Parade,Band Practice,2013.0,"Better rides, new kicks, couple plans
Accessorized with toothpicks and rubber bands
Uniform true to form for how we was raised
Inspired to earn enough to buy us a day
And find us a way that nobody lead us to
And turn it all to green carpet like what's left to do?
Whatever's best for you
Seems to be what I pen so when I leave for my end just say I kept it true
But young enough to know that true ain't enough
When the ones that's even younger just really wanna become ya
And you still tryna become the legend that your neighbor was
Without leaving the same way that they laid him up
All hail and know that if all fails
At least we had a run and no one at all trailed
They wasn't close enough to call them that
The money they was spending is the money that bought them back
We just tryna get it, so when I'm recording that
Know that the theme is reoccurring until we see what they blurring
Singing 'bout where they were when they talk says where they weren't
Know I'm low key but my passport is concurrent
Appreciation at a level that it's never been
String sections for them reppin' who have yet to win
And winning has never been over rated
Lil' bit of worry forever is all it came with
Lil' bit of flurried confetti to show we made it
You know me, I show the parade and show the heinous
You know me, I'm on a wave that was created
By the thought of the waves under the boat where I'm waving
That's deeper than you ever could conceive
Do believe if they ever do believe
I gave them the reason to wanna handle that the way that they do
I'm stubborn like I was Marlo, but maybe I grew
So me changing for you, was mainly to be the one known
Its all a front, I wasn't made to play the son role
And believing you'll get out the way
Is nothing that I believe in as long as y'all breathing
And I promise the Greeks is cool with it
Them brief cases from me is what truly did it
We all run for the lead, shit, who didn't?
But ain't too many left that be speaking a truer sentence
Ticker tape parades in slow motion
Surrounded by the strings while they crowning us as kings
And on the sidewalk is the next you
So may the clock on your crown forever bless you
Sitting on the sidewalk is the next you
So may the clock on your crown forever bless you",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-ticker-tape-parade-lyrics

It's those traveling in the sparks
Daily life what makes me forget my wounded heart
Not much to gain or ?
Daily life what's makes me forget my wounded heart

Long days and long nights
Working the wee hours until the sunrise
Sunlight bring me home
Girl that's calling my phone, like ""nigga don't have my daughter late to school no more""
I kiss her on the cheek and wish her well
That dream is what I sell, that the car, house and dog is in the mail
Fine man's ? and ambition that won't fail
With a down payment that can't be weighed on a scale
A heavy heart that's bleeding all over the canvas
Heart, courage and brains somehow it ain't in Kansas
Dorothy clicking heels but we far from home
Somehow I'm passporting to a continent, airplane mode, on that phone
Jamming a rough cut of that ? we hope to change our shoes
Living and such, that whole livelihood, doing better than good
A few planets from rock bottom, my nigga knew he could

Let's get rich what
Luccini falling from the sky
You see me I'm Jordan before he was balling for the Chi
That's Carolina how dare you compare a mine to mine
When I carry lines these these heroines jock me because I'm fly
I'm groovy, groupies gotta love my style
I'm coolin, my Gucci visor is upside down
Don't lose me foot on the peddle push through the ghetto, my hood, I'm good
Some of these niggas pull strings like Gepetto
I would advise you to seek council
Advise us reroute from the liars or be doused in a fire
As the loot go, new flow, cups of liquor and the juice gold
You go and a new ?, I loop the block and get a new ho
Too grown, new whip
Two tone, new bitch
New kicks, too cold
I do this, let's move on
Crew full, bills ten-fold
Here's a little info -- you niggas slow down and catch the tempo


One time like
Make sure they hear me loud enough where even if I be whispering they can picture it
Or recite what it be if you ever need them to mirror it
And as right as it be if it's left to me to be steering it
I'm four lefts from the door steps of where y'all squaring it
My sincerest of pardons when I be chucking these
Shit I'm new in town and these muthafuckas was chucking me
Missed the shoot around so they underestimating what was under me
Til I'm Louis belting their legs, meaning I buckle knees
I talked what I know be it, metaphors and a flow
So if it's Louis belts then it's Louis belts on all of these hoes
Breathe a little, we made it farther than most
And we don't get to do this often but may we all get to gloat
May the women we around forever wanna be down
May they love Rap Genius and whenever you wanna be loud
May they love a good heel and letting something peek it
In detail all of the whispers I speak about",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-sparks-lyrics

If I would let the beat tell it

That was sitting under this is all you keep hearing
But if the words kick it
And I word different
Then ill be overflowing these until the words missing
Say I be overflowing speech so any word given
Is me going for the reach till my nerves kick in
And then its back to what I’m comfy with
Back to what I understand
Back to where it jump again
Back to going underhand
And anything that that entails
Catch the tail end of this

I’m back to the fourth bar, got my nerves jumpin’

Follow those like it’s a @ sign there

It feels like inheritance

And when the feeling subsides
Do remember how it feels to be high
When feeling that rise
Like me and mine and for every bit of that side
Do remember how it feels to be high
Said it feels like inheritance…

That’s why I’m watching everyone who watches me on stage
I feel confused I can’t feel whose feelings changed
But still pursue these anvils, I feel aflame
And this pursuit got my standing still and feel I lame
I feel away but only say as much as I
Can assume you would understands what undermine
And this mood got me dusting hands with other sides
I’m in bloom but in front of plans with cutting eyes
To no surprise I know I’m wanting mine, but still I search
You get it young and shit is sprung that image works
Shit’ll get worse buying coupes at 19
But still jumping by the ledge
Watching Juice was watching me
But muthafuck a Radames
I was Q minus the Technics
The stoop tried to connect me
My mother saw me dreaming but my scheming is what blessed me
So lets see, assume we tug and war for what the check be
I’m comfortable apart from where the rest be

Know where I'm attached even when I'm attached to the stoop
Thinking I'm doing more than I am 'til you hand me the news
Like I know everything you that you on, I'm actually you
I grew up outside just like the rest of us did, him included
Prayer hands up for all of the ways that I been influenced
Fully loaded, one stick for the crew, stick and moving
14 in my pop's hands, hoping his grip will loosen
But fuck if it didn't, he never would so I was good on a couple decisions
Remember so and so had pulled out a bucket to pitch in
I fell back when I would normally jump in position
Regretted it til they put everyone under the prison
That's like one of 100 times
But feeling obligated to jump up in front the line
Stuck am I between a corner store and a blurried line
Where the shootings' forever and the lobster is butterflied
Stuck am I, down for whatever, nothing rides
But knowing how the end of the movie is underlined
And knowing my pop starred in that movie a couple times
I already knew the script, what a surprise

If memory serves me
I remember wondering what all of that work be
Posted on the same stoop like what the word be
But someone was always standing behind me to curb me
From off where that curb be
If memory serves me
Son I remember jumping off the stoop all thirsty
But being taught that the corner won't ever deserve me
And someone was always standing behind me to curb me
From off where that curb be
If memory serves me

I was born in Kings County, shooters beside me
My son was born in the same hospital as Blue Ivy
My father was 20, I was 35
I'm still tryna measure up to the world he designed
I'm in a world of a bind, like how worldly am I?
To understand the corner store and the world it defines
But comfy in Carnegie Hall like my world wasn't dire
A world of broadway and a world of suppliers
Bag a nickel bag of funk on the live '96 case
And write a thesis on what you see and how the fix tastes
Stories that they sing when it hits and how it fixates
My average through the roof but still grainy as mixtapes
And po-9 see me the same as who standing next to me
But knowing the drop due to my pop's how I get to be
Giving you all the above as opposed to a sketch of me
And all of the should've could've would'ves that I could've put up
And now I look up, red cup pour down
Walls full of murals, shit my father tore down
All of this was thought out, whether I was thinking or not
Somebody was thinking in case I ain't think out the box
So stuck am I, down for whatever, nothing rides
But knowing how the end of the movie is underlined
And knowing my pop starred in that movie a couple times
I already knew the script, what a surprise

If memory serves me
I remember wondering what all of that work be
Posted on the same stoop like what the word be
But someone was always standing behind me to curb me
From off where that curb be
If memory serves me
Son I remember jumping off the stoop all thirsty
But being taught that the corner won't ever deserve me
And someone was always standing behind me to curb me
From off where that curb be
If memory serves me
My memory ain't fade yet
I came up out the same door off the same steps
In love with in the same allure
Like what is we waiting for
'Til I'm gone know that I ain't change yet

If memory serves me
I remember wondering what all of that work be
Posted on the same stoop like what the word be
But someone was always standing behind me to curb me
From off where that curb be
If memory serves me
Son I remember jumping off the stoop all thirsty
But being taught that the corner won't ever deserve me
And someone was always standing behind me to curb me
From off where that curb be

The Shooter’s Soundtrack,The Salvation,2009.0,"Shoulder the blame, strong enough to maybe hold it and aim
Old enough to know the mechanics, like he knowin his name
Young enough to know he can handle it or so he proclaims
Inspired to throw a hand in it and go with the grain
And by default, whatever's performed, is what it's gon' be
Hollows in the sky, drown out heaven's harmonies
Followin the sky 'til they told him it was all speech
Now he cover his ears in case it ever cause heat
All covered and clear, arms within arms reach
Hands on approach, hole wanna fill his heart beat
Hands on the scope, load wanna see him glow
See him grow right in front of your eyes or leave 'em closed
Leave 'em with enough of those and it's enough to lead 'em out
To see the doubt and to see what the similar be about
And if they, all for it and they never say never, it's whatever
Strong purchasin is fifty and better

So raisin band, you day one, get it how you see it
Eyes wide shut but seein is believin
Reason bein, you day one, get it how you see it
Eyes wide shut but seein is believin
And the soundtrack to it is as loud as you can see (*gunshot*)
The soundtrack to it is as loud as you can see (*gunshot*)
The soundtrack to it is as loud as you can see (*gunshot*)
The soundtrack to it is as loud as you can see (*gunshot*)

Told 'em it's easy to get accustom, easier to adjustin then they thought
And seeing's believin, so he believin what he saw
And who would of knew how much he could see behind the door?
They changin the locks baby, he seein what he want
And anything could turn tunnel vision if the ending
Is the opposite left from the beginning
And if winning is the opposite left, than you'd be with it
You be gunnin for a run in that tunnel, pun intended
So he runnin with his gun in the tunnel but still seated
Can't carry it and can't put it down, he still need it
Can't leave it, can't see without it, they blew the lights out
Let it walk in front of 'em and stop whatever come to 'em
Halo up above it, sixteen's sittin under it
God if it jam, may your hands do the coverin
Halo up above it, sixteen's sittin under it
Easy to be a pawn for anybody who want it


Louder than they ever saw, 
doubt 'em and he lettin off
ASAP, everything about 'em has been said before
Brighter than they ever heard, light 'em when they send the word
Take that, one shot right 'em if they ever turn
Take that (*gunshot*), word is murder is cheap
It's work for hire if you 
lying where the murderers be
And the market is still clickin when they callin in need
Findin one is automatic if you walk in the lead
So if he seem a little different and you see what he was given
It's a given understanding that he breathin at his limits
And the limits is, anything the crib might've given him
Was makeover day three, they ain't put the ceiling in
Roof still open so the sky that he was livin in
He throwin shots at it, call it high off of adrenaline
Young enough to kick it with the one I'm pullin under me
Friends teller in, what the tool might wanna be (*gunshot*)",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-shooters-soundtrack-lyrics
Grew Up on Kool-Aid,Band Practice,2013.0,"First of all I wann' thank my connect
Meaning I thank me for every part of my steps
Meaning I thank me for stepping off to the left
Mapquesting the rights but never followed the rest
Back under the lights, I never wanted the stress
But if that come with hype then that's one to impress
Trapped under the life since tagging under the desk
Couldn't tell me that I couldn't be matched up wit the best
Back then I wasn't, forward now I am
Back then I wanted to call it now what I can
Tapped in to wanting to come around in a Lam'
Off a story that you know like the other side of your hand
Meaning that you relate, and that should be enough
Couldn't name another that was accurate as such
Know I weave with the paint cinematically as such
OGs said I say it like when Acura's was up
'95 the diction, 20-20 the view
'95s edition of what was under the stoop
9.5, gifted, up and under your boo
Not a soul as nice so I don't want it with who?
Do remember that I'm the one with the proof
So if I do brag then I was up in that booth
No mic when I was up in that booth
Pinstripe suites, find me up on the 'Tube
I know Mike, MJ salute
Sharing the cigars with the pair that you got on
Tor' know, he was there to tag along
Lou Gehrig records, L&D sweatshirts
Same kid by the speakers when they blared
Moms with 2 jobs so my weekends disappeared
Heard high schoolers blowing reefer in the stairs
I was sitting in the kitchen, it was seeping under there
Banging on the table, scribbling a chorus
Ambition to get it and live it how I saw it
Bowls of Apple Jacks, youngin' me don't play
How the fuck could I ever not be ok?

Grew up on Kool aid
Money by the shoe lace
19, opened the trunk and sold 2-ways
Me and Biz for the win like touché
And spent it all at the mall every few days",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-grew-up-on-kool-aid-lyrics

You find that when you rewinding us

Okay, this is like designer drugs
Hook em off the leak
Got em tripping like they finding love
Look for all you need
I was listening to how they pump
Push that off and leave
That's my interest baby line them up
This shit got me right above echelon gated
I was different than expected so
I helped them along the way and
They was itching for an exit and I helped them on the way
And the top said they could eye it
They ain't guess I have to weigh it
Said they knew like that initially
Skeptical to christen me
Know I'm Kemba fitted and the letters with a difference beat
Know I'm Kemba fitted and the letters with a difference beat
Said it twice so maybe on the second you could picture me
Perfectly aligned on the dolo

Well they looked at what was left and then desribed me in the leadest
But I'm just trying to G this
From pitching how they couldn't
Get this like I'm Gooden
And you get it like you couldn't
And if they understood it then they right where they should be
And a mountain full of words
It'd be right where they should ski
And you sneeze when it's blessing you
See how much the letters do
Written on your clothes how we seeing all that residue
Sentence round ya nose pardon me for going honest
I call it like I see it when I see it sprinkled on her

The Hustle Never Sleeps,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"1st verse:
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
But them short ambitions is more than you'll ever know
Call them small wins but for my friends in the hole
That money will make the bondsman call up to let 'em go
Shopping sprees, dropping G's on the shoes your girl choose
Like ""fuck is there to lose""?
Bouncing in the pine rover, stunt and drive slower
Day ones over my shoulder, no one can fade me
Chrome stocks gleaming, grown man im good on the features
And finding 50's up under the seats and
Get to reaching if you want it
I'm leaning on anybody interrupting in the sound of my money doubling
Cups runneth, over with 100's and running
To snatch a couple more cups with cupboards to tuck 'em
End of discussion, I got the Niño Brown flow
To squeeze the town til I'm gone
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up
Hook:
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are
Well maybe one day you'll be a star
2nd verse:
Last seen outta state where I got my name
I'm deep in the south serving up top game
Running through a city and they're coke bottle dames
They work at the shake club, their money ain't a thing
Your worst fear it seems, me and my guys roll tight like the CMBs
And get to this money for the love of bleeding green
Geno the way we Jet over screens
We together like a link to hit a Brinks before you blink
We flip checks like 'Bron, stitch reps like yarn
And Tryna stretch like a bond
My joints is Show Mag, who dig in their own bag
And we sip Nobilo and live by Hov raps, you kno the facts
Pre-hook:
But until then they think
I'm the one who's crazy
Cause that's the way you're making me feel
I'm just tryna get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real
3rd verse:
While y'all munching punching the clock
I did the same til I cut out a lane and got the fuck out that box
Never again be under that rock
I caught visions of the Roc, no K, and I wanted a spot
Unstoppable, it read like a heist, run the drop on you
We want the light that's on top you
My motto?, 
stack rocks like Colorado
The stress turned us into Hennessy aficionados
And it's a damn shame what you're not, who?
Slick like a gato, Skyzoo
My pops knew just what he did on the slide through
Talking like the greatest and that's just what he created, ha
Legendary, one of one
Could pulled out for y'all sake but what's done is done
Fast forward to me and, know what I be on and the song we believe in

Turning 10,Milestones,2020.0,"My man used to sling to his mother
Took a couple dollars off so she ain't think he don't love her
I said damn son your pops don't care? He said ""Son, I don't know""
My father been in and outta Rikers since I was 9 years old
He passed me the L and then continued to bag snow
I pictured myself in his shoes and took a drag slow
His mother came in the room with seven singles
He gave her a bag of stones, her face said heaven sent you
I was 14, known as a mixture of straight scheming and debate teaming
A tug of war to break me even, I was weaving through what was intended and what was a given
Where it's easy to jump in the rhythm and fuck with the vision
Been forever since we kicked it, last thing I heard is he was bidding
They got him infinity number dripping
The juxtaposition of what the allure be
They placed him with his pops so now gets to tell his father the story

All my friends who got a son with their ex
I tell them right off the deck
Go and get your son when he turns 10
And all the women I know who know what's best
And the way that this shit is set
Give that boy up when he turns 10
I applaud you for thuggin' it
Never wavering how you loving him
But now it's daddy's turn to run with him
So if you got a son with you ex
I tell you right off the deck
Go and get your son when he turns 10

I was 10 when I moved from Crown Heights to the Stuy
Took me from Ebbets Field to up the block from B.I
My mother said yo you've hit an age where you're bout to feel a change
And as a woman there's only so much I can demonstrate
At first I ain't get it, young and innocent, blind fold the differences
Penning and dribbling over 1010 skinnies and bigger reluctance
My father was always around but at 10 it adjusted
And all the layers that it comes with
Like a man can't teach a girl how to be a woman
And a woman can't teach a boy how to be a man
So like Tre and them, my dad made the call to moms
She said you wanted him you got him and my corner evolved
So when a block party's jumping
And my friends moms pulled me aside like talk to him, maybe your aura can touch him
I get it, but really though I'm just funneling this tradition down
From back when I turned 10 to the shit I give you now

All my friends who got a son with their ex
I tell them right off the deck
Go and get your son when he turns 10
And all the women I know who know what's best
And the way that this shit is set
Give that boy up when he turns 10
I applaud you for thuggin' it
Never wavering how you loving him
But now it's daddy's turn to run with him
So if you got a son with you ex
I tell you right off the deck
Go and get your son when he turns 10

I know a girl who I told this all to
Homey of mine, heard it and felt it was all true
Told me her only problem is that if she can't find him
Then how can she realign him with her son like fuck is she 'sposed what to do?
I told her what you do, is show him what you're down for
Keep wearing the pants and never let him take his crown off
Never let him become the mu'fucker he came from
Don't let that define him, there's still time to save son, but otherwise
You got a son with you ex
I tell you right off the deck
Go and get your son when he turns 10
And all the women I know who know what's best
And the way that this shit is set
Give that boy up when he turns 10
I applaud you for thuggin' it
Never wavering how you loving him
But now it's daddy's turn to run with him
So if you got a son with you ex
I tell you right off the deck
Go and get your son when he turns 10",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-turning-10-lyrics
Hands Folded Together,Music For My Friends,2015,"Truly yours and not a string attached
Ringer rap, a loop involved?, you bet I bring it back
Singer rap is not at all what I be swinging at
I know too many singers for me to tune up a note
So for me to do what they know is for me to do what you don't
My hands like I'm LeGrand, I'm D to shoot up the goat, ha
Quote it, cause idol aiming is the height of training
You cover that and that'll cover back from how they played it
Made it, at the top where it's just us
It was me and then I took on the lead and pulled us up
I'm in the cut like additives, balance what your batter is
I turn Steph Curry and dance on ;em like packages
Whoa, wait, I'm just doing what I do best
I'm from where you either move or don't move without a vest
Whoa, wait, I'm just true to what I protect
My hands folded together, the proof inside of the checks
Know the motto right?

Hands folded together
One size fit all
These plans go to whatever
Winner takes all
And stand over whoever
Free to ride along
But it cost to wanna help us
Know the motto right
Hands folded together
One size fit all
These plans go to whatever
Winner takes all
And stand over whoever
Free to ride along
But it cost to wanna help us
Know the motto right

Release what's in me, besides the Henny
 its ink outta '95
With day ones who at a blink is down kamikaz'
Behind the ride but inspiring the drive
Like the engine in the back so you're behind your attire
Wait, engine in the back, luggage in the front
So you're behind your attire like tucking a button up
OK, comprehend it easy, tailor made
Sell black and white over black and whites, they compositions need me
I just take a couple stanzas, price tag the banter
And spend it on Phillipe's like velvet chicken's the answer
Art talk with zo catchers and scramblers
Weigh out the pay out and may y'all see anthems
Theme music for seeing to it and weaving through it
The metronome is herringbone how we're influenced
Step alone, my stepping stone is G rooted
I never rome, I'm better home, keep it the truest
Know the motto, right?


You can't continue to miss me over and not reap the repercussions
Me putting careers to sleep just only keeps the reaper dusting
Himself off, for you cowards beneath a thousand deaths
I bet if I watch you kick it like a FIFA crowd
You'll probably mix your reefer clouds with meth, cause its not sane
To try to match up, with this octane, you're far from Oxford
With your ox brain, when punchlines hit, as if I box train
It's hard to keep me inside of a boxed chain
Once the weak link within the lock's strain, ripping free and stretch
From my slick talk, that at times is too slippery to catch
I could've been a giant, walk through, crush the buildings
Run you up outta town, set up and ask for high rent
That's next level thuggin'
I'm a poet 
and you ain't even know it

After they pour it, it's better to go with your gut feeling than be heroic",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-hands-folded-together-lyrics
True Romance,UnKnown,UnKnown,"This is a story
Of when the streets fall in love
Really fall in love, where your life depends on that love
For the average ghetto child, the yellow brick road is dim
The lights are blacked out and the chances are cut slim
The success rate never outweighs the opposite
Money, cash, hoes, is something we gotta get
Boys learn how to be men from getting caught up
And grown women can't find time to raise daughters
So this is what happens when a girl is left out
A future princess forced to the next route
Her name was Heaven, beautiful from day one
An angel on Earth if god ever made one
But she was born and raised in the pits of poverty
Cocaine deals, homicides and robberies
Daddy walked out on Heaven before preschool
Mommy wasn't around to show her what the streets do
She was finding out what a bottle of Hennessy does
And hated her daughter for being prettier than she was
Seemed like Heaven knew anything but that
The older she got, the more hell would come back
By the time she was approaching thirteen
She knew how to lick them lips and work jeans
Eighteen came and went, and so did high school
She paid the bills by fucking with the right dudes
But she wasn't known for ho'ing in the streets
Classy with hers, no ass, just hugs
Something like a female mac, full blown
Never fall in love with her, you know the code
But all that changed when her eyes were placed upon Marcus
Neighborhood hustler, heartless
Grew up the same way Heaven did
Parents was dead beats, so he felt heaven was heaven sent
Started off slow then it grew sky-high
Ladies and gents, meet the new Bonnie and Clyde
Chorus
They say true romance is hard to get to know
And the ones with it never really let it go
But when it's hood, the real stick by one another
And you ride or you die for your lover
And that's real
The more time passed, the more they were together
They both found love so they was down for whatever
He gave her quality time, she would hide his bricks
Soul mates, he called her his ride or die bitch
Needless to say, she deaded the blind dates
Marcus was still in the streets, but why wait
He took her out of her home, took her out of her hell
She said bye to Reeboks, said hi to Chanel
Anything Heaven wanted, Marcus gave her
And she adored him, looked up to him like a savior
She would be his lookout when he was doing dirt
He gave her a .22 and made her keep it in her purse
Showed her where the stash was under the mattress
And she would give him back rubs without him asking
He made her bag dudes, flirt a little bit
Go on dates while Marcus would stick up the crib
They was ruthless, but honestly, how could you blame them?
They only had each other, nothing is what they came from
But the hood was hating, and when they saw the money they was making
The cops was sent in to break 'em
Heaven got rid of the coke before they kicked in
So Marcus was only charged with breaking and entering
Judge hit him off with a mandatory 5
Small bid but Heaven knows he couldn't do the time
For the first two weeks, Heaven fell apart
She ain't just lose a man, she lost her heart
And every week she was sending him letters and pictures
Slide through on a visit, give him weed when she kissed him
Six months passed and Marcus couldn't take it
Being in a box was stripping his heart naked
Fuck that, he wrote back in one of his letters
""Daddy's coming home, I need a piece of Heaven""
Chorus
Late night, Marcus kidnapped one of the guards and
Snuck past the security margin
Dressed like a C.O., he met Heaven in the next town
With a rent-a-car, but little did he know
Word spread fast that an inmate dashed
And pigs from all over was plotting on his ass
Cop cars flying at 110 speed
Tipped off by a gas station at 10-D
Shots start going off aiming at the rental
Heaven at the wheel and shit is getting suspenseful
One flew through the back, caught Marcus in the back
And tapped the bone, he felt something crack
Heaven started crying and sweating all heavy
Doubling the speed limit but holding it steady
Marcus told shorty to drive to the crib
She thought he was crazy but still listened to her baby
Parked out front and dragged him up the stairs
Went inside and laid on the floor, scared
The bullet still sitting there, stuck in his spine
He whispered to his woman that he's coming to die
Now she's getting hysterical, taking it hard
He said before I go to jail, I'd rather die in your arms
She crawled to the mattress, pulled out the .9
Kissed him goodbye and helped him close his eyes
With his lifeless frame laying there in her lap
Her heart felt weak, her soul started to crack
She started hearing sirens, the D's was coming
But without her other half, she couldn't see running
Cops start kicking in the door all reckless
She took a deep breath and reached for a weapon
Put it in her mouth and ruined the cops' plans
Squeezed the trigger, she was back with her man
In heaven",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-true-romance-lyrics
A Song For Fathers,Milestones,2020.0,"Understood it back then but even more now
It's easier to feel it when it's your child
When forever is the only thing you want now
Middle man with the baton, pass it on down
Pass what he gave me to mine in due time
From how to put a fist in the air to shooting five
To how to not give in to fear when the blues arrive
He said my only job was making sure you survive
Duly noted, all the direction that you were throwing
I might not have known where it led but I knew the motive
So all the conversations that might've turned into more
Was to keep me from writing from the other side of the wall
My friends never had their pop so you became it
Yours died when you were a child so you related
Taught us that everything you are and what becomes of you
Is usually everything that was be front of you

Believe it
Youngin' do believe it
Super hero dad, capes on, you know how we get
And this one is a song for my father, let the radio repeat it
A song for my father, let the radio repeat it
A song for my father, let the radio repeat it
Like everyday is Father's Day weekend
Celebrate it, celebrate it, celebrate it
Yeah, velebrate it, celebrate it

The day that the baton came to me
Heart started jumping when your mom came to me
And said that you were cooking
I was overlooking Brooklyn knowing we had to leave
Cause I wanted you to see more when you repeat after me
You were born I was torn, a feeling never before
But I knew the world waiting for you is forever more
Every cop that's outta pocket with his rep in his in his hand
And every word thrown at me to make me less of man
Was all fully aligned here for you to take part in
So put your whole chest in whatever you put your heart in
I put it on the table there's nothing that can surprise you
Keep you the wiser before they try to Korey Wise you
Miles the miracle, every part of your breath
Doctors told me my only hope was IVF
So know that everything that you are and what becomes of you
Is usually everything that be in front of you

Believe it
Youngin' do believe it
Super hero dad, capes on, you know how we get
And this one is a song for my father, let the radio repeat it
A song for my father, let the radio repeat it
A song for my father, let the radio repeat it
Like everyday is Father's Day weekend
Celebrate it, celebrate it, celebrate it
Yeah, celebrate it, celebrate it

If there was ever a man who was generous, gracious and good
That was my dad, hollow tipped his way out the hood
Shot through it and showed me how to hop to it
Like never let nobody ever say what you're not doing, unless it's me
Same rule apply to the one that I made
Only one I'll give it to if he wanted my lane, all yours, nothing that I won't provide
From the first time that you saw the world and you opened mine
My pop made sure that I was all the way fine
Even when him and my mom were saying all their goodbyes
So shout out to my mother and all the mothers for their comforting
The best ones got a father that's in love with them, right
So this is for the father's support
The ones that you couldn't pay enough to walk out the door
And the ones who know that everything you are and what becomes of you
Is usually everything that be in front of you

Believe it
Youngin' do believe it
Super hero dad, capes on, you know how we get
And this one is a song for my father, let the radio repeat it
A song for my father, let the radio repeat it
A song for my father, let the radio repeat it
Like everyday is Father's Day weekend

Duffle Bag Weekends,Milestones,2020.0,"Two cribs but couldn't keep me inside none
You know tryna be outside until outside’s done
Too many reasons to not be out when the time comes
And too many dice games, so find me inside one
Born in the 80s, raised in 90s typical shit
Dirty handed or not, you know what the gist of it is
Couldn't duck it, so we become it, easy to fall in love with
But young enough to not understand all that it come with
So umm, inset parents here
Couldn't turnaround without seeing both standing there
Still on my 1-2, same as the ones with me whenever I come through
Forever we’re one group
And solo records could never come outta son group
But I had a Nike bag who always sung too
The hood like damn Sky in the house, what son do?
Nah if you don't see him come around then he back at his mother house
Word, same rules at her house, I couldn't slip through that
Her new boyfriend's trash, I wanted to get him clapped
Different story, but my mother was still the difference for me
All the composure I use to get you off me is from her
But I still got that other side that comes alive
Picture furious styles pushing a bubble 5
There it is, raised by it over a shot of Henny
Nowadays we reflect on it til the bottles empty
Old Knicks and Ralph Lauren and Spike
And all of my catalog and the songs that get him hype
And he laughs like you know how many shoot outs I was in
For him to be your hero off the movies I done lived
But still, he understood all the glare in my eyes
You never think that a hero can be where you reside
And I ain't never turn an eye, never took it for granted
But it was everyday so I ain't have to understand it
He said he was joking, I poured him another shot
Knowing he wasn't joking bout everyone that he popped
Trained me the same way, that I truly understood
And I ain't have the same reasons but I shoot it just as good, right
Me and mine got a story or two
Nothing that needs to spoken up over the loop
Just know that it all makes sense when it’s hindsight
My mother told me be like your father when the times right
My pop told me your mother’s here to give you emotion
And I'm here to give you the aim to blow shit open, fully loaded
Recollecting shit til the song stops
A green Nike duffle bag’s still my soft spot, for real

Saw it all but that wasn't the only thing I saw
Corner store said I promise we can get it all
Momma taught me through it all just to stand tall
And poppa taught me if they reach blow their hands off, blow their hands off
I bet you I can fit a whole weekend in my duffle bag
I bet you I can fit a whole weekend in my duffle bag
I bet you I can fit a whole weekend in my duffle bag
I bet you I can fit a whole weekend in my duffle bag

Try and get a letter through
Told I'm paintin' pictures to show 'em what a letter do
Literally speakin' I'm throwin' 'em another step or two
Literaturely speakin' I've spoken enough to set a new

Call it a proceeding, go to better pens
Came up throwin' tags so I'm buffin' out your relevance
Jumpin' over negligence
Nothin' they can peddle in
Can be a better platter then the service that you settled in
Product of a corner where it's cheaper if you step on it

I sign before I signed, get my sneakers and go

We done passed that stage and the click blaow!

Niggas lost like the Tribe of Shabazz
Find 'em with a verse that'll surprise their ass

Heat spit, street shit have me way off my Dīn

With my man 9th Wonderful Tunes, that's what I call him
Yeah, BK, from Winston-Salem to Durham to Raleigh and all that
You already know what it is
Custom Made, HOJ, figured we'd save a couple lives
It started like this

I sat back and watched all of the bullshit
Wonderin' if it was ever gonna back track
Saw the industry spaz and do a full flip
Then I jumped like naw, I can't have that
So I thought, before I start my debut
I'd take a couple days and get lifted
Put something together to start a break thru
A hit em light, cuz this is only the quick shit
I went in the stash, found all the 9th Wonder beat tapes I had
And put them on blast
I know 9th, I'm good friends with son
These are not off of the net, I ain't fish for none
These were handed to me directly from Mr. Douthit
And Mr. Taylor's gonna put a swag around it
So me and 9th invite y'all to fuck with your neighbors
Right next door, bare witness to the greatest

Yeah, bare witness to what y'all need
And what y'all want, long time coming

Cuz great minds think alike, so when you think alike

Call it what you wanted but we just called it a day spent
Shit you couldn't learn in the crib but was always saved with
Or saved by, so say bye and hit the pavement
Rules of engagement, don't ever rule out the amazement
Of better dreaming from never sleeping due to a grave shift
Boats in abundance, shipments in corner containers
Locally funded, literally foreign exchanges
Know the occasion, on occasion I had to stay in
But most of the time I was outside where the play is
Difference was, I understood what all of the issues was
Same way I understood a pistol run
Such a dichotomy, all on the sides of me
Wasn't much room left, so nothing else got to me
From John Coltrane to Danny Simmons to Richard Wright
To friends with a brick of white, nothing was outta reach
But fuck it be proud of me, this could've went wild left
The key to it is never leaving it where denial's left
I knew what I was gunning for, and who was fixing my aim so when the gun go off
Shit'll be one shot, told there's only one top, but that the bottom got wild space
Regardless of how many people was on that ground chase
Circling around base, opinions in the kitchen how they circling around base
Way too many cooks, but I was raised by a crook who found his way through a book
And another one and another one, and changed the way you look
At his son and at his two other sons, my brothers and me
Swear to God I put my arm up over what they could see
So may Jehovah or Allah or Buddah bless us
Or whoever else you're calling like par can you protect us?
I zip up my Colombia jacket while my man is beeping Colombians
Like yo this shit ain't locking at all, fuck it I'm done with them
Contracts voided over pay phones
I'm there for moral support but need to make my way home
My pops got tickets for Bring in The Noise, Bring in The Funk
And BBQs after that yo this shit is a jump
All my men's in the front as we load up inside the Wrangler
Same one like the one I went and bought where the roof change up
And all of that do change us, could've been a different view
Never know the bags under your view until they stick with you
But sleep is the cousin of the death, so never sleep
My pop said I've been up since you was born, best believe
Best believe you're gonn' believe it all when you get to be
And I been up since December 20th, 2017, do believe (Eyes wide shut)
And I been up since December 20th, 2017, do believe (Eyes wide shut)

At Least I Got One,Milestones,2020.0,"My sneakers were always whatever I wanted within reason
My reason was based on who was jumping out the BM
Seeing what we saw from the door and we still geeking
Crowd him around the store he gets to dumping out per diem
How I see it, we were inspired by who's beside us
Heavy is the cuts on the head, true as a line up
Be it princess or Andis, or 50 dollar stand-ins
The weight of all 3 like I'm triple beaming the canvas
Shoulder to shoulder, know what it costs the same way
That I know my composure but still stood there, we good here
Easily mistook here, for one another often
But I don't ever mind it like I'm cutting you a portion
Things dude hopping out the BM showed me
Added that to what my pops used to feed me to hold me
Made sense of it, played parallel, same differences
Parents ain't married but I still could wave a ringer in
So being all we saw, pay no attention
Seen enough already to get what all was a given
Corner stores and ambiance the world we live in
My hands raised in advanced placement, what a collision
Blowing bud on the roof and aiming an empty clip at a cloud
In awe of a 4 pound without a mission
Loving the aura of being part of what we envisioned
Blind without seeing it, my pops on my beeper and
Heineken in my jeans like we were Casper and Telly
Know I'll be right where you need yo I'll back when you're ready
Mad at me cause my house is a home, out where I rose
Feel the need to be proud that I won't be out here alone, right?
Prayers up for who ain't blessed like I
Praising a drought, my pops ain't never left me dry
No apologies for bringing this ringer out with me
You get your brother? That's fine, shit you know where I'ma lean, right?
At least I got one mu'fucker
Same reason my Wrangler don't got the top up mu'fucker
Mega salutes to the ones who ain't as blessed as me
I leave you the same food that he left for me
At least I got one mu'fucker
Same reason my Wrangler don't got the top up mu'fucker
Never hide from that so I ain't have to step aside
And I'll never hide the fact that my dad ain't never hide

Parade Me,The Great Debater,2011.0,"They trynna parade me, they trynna parade me
Whether their intentions are to pose or to praise me
We just getting started baby all of this is crazy
But tell them I don't mind because none of that will change me
So we can celebrate it (hey) we can celebrate it
So we can celebrate it (hey) we can celebrate it
So we can celebrate it (hey) we can celebrate it
So we can celebrate it (hey) we can celebrate it
They trynna parade me

My pen theory is fine as Amel Larrieux
On the page you can see that design all up in the groove
Off the gauge you can see how I'm liable to get it through
When it plays you would think you outside of my living room
None more vivid or more in it to talk with it
When it's all finished the talk did it I'm all in it
When they talk get em they bout him like ""pa listen
Son is all product, the floor about him just all shifted""
I mean, call it a crisis of leadership, but he was just
Carrying the load for the Joe's that wanted to see us win
I'm more of the Stringer role
My part is to sling it low
From beyond beyond just keep me off the ringer yo
Audience becomes the keepers of the sing alongs
Back and forth wording
Call it catalog turbans
Wrap around it if you will
Say I'm back to y'all service
Tell em my enthusiasms where the curb is


The flow I'm on is full of my addiction if you know the god
You know that it looks like Univision baby toast to y'all
You know if it move you moving with it so you know you all
Share and share alike, share the light if it should go to y'all
Protocol, follow that, follow like you follow @'s
You follow Patron with Patron while I follow Yak
You follow me home I get home you a block in back
My hood know I roam like my phone got a model app
Back to what I'm in this for
Ask em what my business on
They know that I rhyme like none alive like I ain't lived before
They know that I rhyme that other side and what I'm sitting on
They know when I rhyme it's like they rhyme, they on this accord
Pocket flow, plugged it off the leg and I ain't miss a cork
Dip between the bass, you see the bass, I ain't miss a cord

Along The Way,The Penny Freestyle Series Pt 2,2013.0,"The allure of just saying no more
Like I done said the most and if you waited too long
Then that's you, that's on you and the time that's in the air
But if you need what it be the rewind button is there
I tried rushing you here but you was kinda content
And now shit's getting thick and its you that's climbing the fence
I did it from day one, I never took off a night
I never shook off the light, in the midst of a great run
I told you what I was on and showed you double or nothing
The ones who really heard are the ones who cut the discussion
Like ""nah, Sky got it, there's nothing for him to prove
If he ever laced 'em up you'd be running outta ya shoes""
You being whoever,the name of them doesn't matter
They know I'm not for play, I'm raising them up as rappers
But the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
And then it gets tough to say I'm a fucking rapper
2 for 2 with the classics and got a 3rd coming
And I ain't drop one verse that didn't earth something
Even the throw always was shit you would go to play
And say that the only thing beside it that you kno is jay
The day ones, all of them know how me do
I'm pretty much Earl Manigault but no needles
So when you talking Kareem or Wilt or Connie Hawk
Remember who they was modeling when they stepped on the court
Stand for the city?, I done stood forever
Every record was Brooklyn bridge overlooking together
Every record was Southside or the X or Harlem
Or the islands, I was about 'em so I'm begging your pardon
But lets say I went and did it, brought him straight to the work
And at the end was an arrow to point him straight to a hearse
Would the power circle of the city stand tall
And recognize the real and how they handle support?
Doubt it, and I can jump for the bait that he leaves
I'm NY to the death when they was changing they teams
But they opened up the doors for him to say what he please
It don't help that the real king went and gave him the keys
Doing verses on a remix, shit why wouldn't he think he's it?
I would think the same with all them reach ins
Not a shot it's a drop of honesty
And if I pour the whole glass that's more that you gotta clean
So I'll leave it there and you know where I stand
Talking music for my friends and one love to my fans
So I'll leave it there and you know where I stand
Talking music for my friends and one love to my fans

Meeting the Presidents,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Who wanna bet us that we don’t touch lettuce
Stack cheddar forever
No treachery till they get to us
Doing what’s best for us is far today
But tomorrow will be tomorrow and tomorrow can wait
We need it now, need a sound that we can borrow or chase
To be around when we around it’s solely honest to trees
And you call it how you see it, we call it awake
Till we ignore the law being all in our face
Shit, you all for the taste and we wanted the recipe
Learn it and burn it before they get to reach
You feel me? Jealousy and slandered eyes wanted to kill me
Or at least spoke like it but no one approached like it
So yeah, and they stressin’ the air reason for them
But it’s more soul, my Morse code build it with them
We talk law and wardrobe built for the win
And the win ‘cause confetti could fall at any event
Hopes tell you get in, dreams tell you to stay and wow
If it all should fall apart before you take a bow
Then may the day be living proof that you made away

I want money like Cosby, who wouldn’t?
Or at least Raven Symone the way Raven Symone was cooking
May have been wrong or I may have mistook it
But my attention is to talk to you through song and sing how we looking
They showed us everything but looks deceive
They made a world of pain, a world where only crooks could breathe
Then they dare us to take a breath and they dare us to make a left
When the right after the lights is what they pushed beneath
You see? Shit I’m involved with got me pins and needles
‘Cause if this pin don’t push the needle where I need to it’ll be pens that bleed you
I’m here to tell, shorty, it ain’t all swell
There’s heaven then there’s hell to catch you when you fell, shorty
We all fall, it’s just about where we landing, they heroes on all fours like they forgot how to stand
The ones who stood all be the ones that raised us
Forgive us for being stubborn, the industry couldn’t change us
And well, if that should hinder us, I’m tryna get the digit up
And we’ll just take it back to what we know and what the ceiling does

And took the wheel when they
Stopped believing that money made us
Cause till they pay us
I promise to make em' fuckin hate us
Love us later but pay us now and be done with favors
Olympians and black fistin'
How the running made us
And bar none so clearly they wanna running mate us
Campaign for this bread

I'm out in Beijing browsing
Far from my Banana Republic styling

Is how to act cool

Kitchen Table,Live From the Tape Deck,2010.0,"Vowed to never live on my knees
Never beg, I'm never fed, off of 'gimme' or 'please'
I never bled off of crawlin'
So if I should bleed it's from my hands dry wallin'
Holdin' this shit is me
Every wall that I installed, every entrance you see
I drew it all and through it all, up to just what it be
Knew it all, true to all, movin' on, true to form
Forgiveness is at the end and I got endings to weave
Attaching 'em where they meet at
Back to where my lean at
Dreams got wings but they clippin' 'em where they breathe at
So fuck tryin' to sing I'm tryin' to swing where the seat's at
And know that anything that I bring, I'm tryin' to read that
I try to fight a feelin' but the feeling subsides
And the high that you've been given when you get to provide
Is to find the ambition that you wish to revive
Live and die, but while you livin', keep the kitchen in mind

And remember, the place mats is laid where they should be at
And everybody made they way to where they seats at
Feel like all eyes on me from how they need that
Can't be mad at 'em cause here is where they eat at
So me, I'm tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
And put enough around for everyone of them mouths
I mean, I'm just tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
And put enough around for everyone sittin' down
I mean...

The process of providin' and tryin' to find it
And words passin' the margin and contemplating consignment
And circle backwards and forwards and fallin' for the reminder
Then stressin' over these plates and the utensils that's beside 'em
You countin' three times and hopin' you counted wrong
Till all of the count is gone
And all that you counted on ain't on the table
And you was suppose to make sure that was decent
And now all this decorating is needed
Never waited to see it cause ain't nobody waitin' to be seated
And they ain't tryin' to change up how they eatin'
Man of the house entails bringin' home anything but a reason
Cause a reason can't clear away the grievance
So fuck all that
Before departin' I'll turn into 
G. Garvin
As long as the plate is straight I can deal with the deeper margins
Long as I'm 808 I can deal with being a target
Long as we ate today you can call it what you call it

But remember, the place mats is laid where they should be at
And everybody made they way to where they seats at
Feel like all eyes on me from how they need that
Can't be mad at 'em cause here is where they eat at
So me, I'm tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
And put enough around for everyone of them mouths
I mean, I'm just tryin' to decorate the kitchen table
And put enough around for everyone sittin' down
And remember, the place mats is laid where they should be at
And everybody made they way to where they seats at
Feel like all eyes on me from how they need that
Can't be mad at 'em cause here is where they eat at

I rock rubber bands, but not for fashion
I keep 'em cause I'm literally stacking
And I don't fuck with Visa or plastic, I just pull out a 
And wrap it with elastic, pillowcase stash it
Spit straight acid, the stars is lookin' in
I sit you on your ass, like your father should've did
Ladies and Gentlemen it's the world renowned
The city's favorite hustler I  up your town

Her deep throat so mean, she can't hear in her mouth???
Lot of clones out for the throne, that's trying to be me
Call this a mean sixteen, I call it easy

Strollin' a hundred miles ahead of the rest

So imperfect, spit when the shit wasn't worth it
Gang way deeper than what people see on the surface
And that gat, small on my back, is for a purpose
Them niggas tryn' run up on National Self Service
I'll never be a slave or servant to any man
I'm ridin' up slow and I'm letting the semi blam
Damn, another dead body on my belt
In a land down under where your mommy can't help
You behind on the rent? I'm something like a pimp
I grind overtime and bought the landlord a whip
Tales from the crib
, the bl* is on my hip
Black bulletproof vest, a book bag full of clips
That's deep shit, deeper than deep six
Deep as the bottomless pit, and even the abyss
Shit...

I treat it like him and him, you only get one shot
And if you spit one line, saying you slum rock
I'm walking away, and if you not say ""son stop""
I don't need that, and you ain't ever seen that
You need to try being a fan, and relax

I can tell when the cops is looking, crack heads
Smell what the block is cooking, and which rock they pushing
""off white"", strips stay open all night

Praying Against D’evils,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"1st verse:
This shit is wicked on these mean streets, but all of my friends speak
Cause we all that we got til these ends meet
Middle finger the rest though, cause if we ain't grow from the jump
Then you relating is done
And whoever said the speakers was the easy way out, couldn't understand the mechanics
And these faggot ass industry folk, granted
9 to 5 is how you survive
But my moms had 2 jobs so for her, 9 to 5 was 5 to 9
My spirit broke, and my vision altered
Cause you kno how visions go, it's either pray to God or Shawn Corey
That's just being honest and that's what was before us
And fuck if it's worth the risk cuz that's just what we wanted
I'd break bread with my day ones and school neighbors
All the ones who wound up on the front of your newspaper
Shit is dangerous, money and power is changing us
Blood on the steeple, praying against d'evils
Verse 2:
We all wanted the spotlight
And even if we're innocent we're scared of the cop lights
The irony right?, we saw the same things vying for life
It was either find a Dominican or find us a mic
Thinking back when we first learned to make a decision
And the thought of having to live with that as long as we're living
It was like, a hand around my collar, saying to breathe
And every time I'd attempt it would clench until I gave in
I tried to hear me out but wasn't convinced
And playing GQ made Bishop's of some of my friends
Who could ever foresee
We used to live for the night and now I'm paranoid tonight is my signal to leave
All the years we were brother like
Saw each other's mothers as the mother type and now you want my mother's light
Well none of that is meant at all, so my call
Is to guard her from that misery and make it yours, d'evils
Verse 3:
My flesh nobody can test, my soul is possessed
With this beautiful mess called success, and I guess
I'm at a point where I do shit off the lonely
Like ""stupid I know you know me and your whole word owe me, strip!""
Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fucking life
And so my fans assume that I'm that fucking type
Low and behold I talk the shit that I know cause I know it
And my friends that's left are unloaders
And so, what all of this means
Is that they're ready to lick off if you should intervene
I can't be held accountable, d'evils keep me around dudes
That do whatever is needed for me to keep it how we seen it by the stoop
Don't test me, I never cower
But Ima brand so Paeso's will put you next to flowers
Do believe as a lesson learned for the less inclined
Raised as a Jehovah's Witness but might never get inside, d'evils",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-praying-against-devils-lyrics

My jump shot is like a sling they set from the roof
They trynna sign me for the wing like I met the Maloofs
On my Jimmer
Mania through the winter
And tell em' king me like I'm playin Theo remember
Kitchen table author
For every kitchen table playin' part
In the paraphernalia they made a market
Word to every fitted I own
Like they designed a New Era store to resemble my home
Home grown on the easily defined
I'm easily aligned
With no one else proceeding up a rhyme
Let's get to the preceedings baby
Seek and you shall find
That nobody means more to a beat than brother Sky
Brother Mouzone
Guns wit' the pies
Feed you and leave like run to your demise
Demise for the trash
Survival for the dope
They turned the words back
And the ridin' for the slope
They put the dope in the back so we ridin' here alone
Like if dope was in the bag and we just trynna get us home
Damn
Too high
That was too high
I shoulda threw it lower
But Twitter be wantin' me to throw in two's like I'm Noah
So everything is double entendre's
Hold up
Corner store hold ups
Just trynna and fill a hole up
And everything is double entendre's
Hold up
Corner store hold ups
To try and fill a hole up
Catch that if you may
The levels I relay
Is like Oakland and Orlando
We headed for a trade
Me and Webber switchin' snap backs
Back track
June 30th 93'
Shit'll never be the same

The Feeling,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"1st verse:
I keep it realer than most, I know you feel it
High off the allure where the hopes go thru the ceiling
Ride until we all got dough stuffed in the ceiling
Spade throughout the day so the hopes that I'm revealing are more honest than ever
We keep it honest together, and on 100 like the pedal I'm on top with these leathers
Playa these are Michael Toschi's
Easy I be low key
And if you heard that new either it's now you kno me
Or you knew from before
On my back, the flyest clothes cause if I flew through the store
My splurge is just to cover my nerves over these turns
You see they lead us to this road we get on
Then we collide but for now life close your eyes and, feel this long
All 9 and a half
And since the day before Christmas rewriting my path
Is all I ever really did, and still
S.K. drowning models his wave
And if mufuckas ain't talking them duckets, then what they saying
2nd verse:
Even if it ain't sunny shit it ain't no different
My passenger side still looks like Erica Mena
Well shorty, ""where you disappear to son?"", I'm wit the winners
Putting myself in a position like no one that's living
I'm living, the ill street blues will get your stomach turning like what the word is?
Until that word will make your peoples get to turning
Fool, I'm thorough, pick any borough, nobody word it
How I do so my promise to you, is to paint you murders
You feeling it?
To all the girls who bought the tape cause they thought I was cute
And a month later I'm the reason for all that they knew
Who say they understand they man off of all that I threw
Now bid adieu to what you used to like
And to all the corners, all the servers, all the shooter types
Who said it made sense after they heard me and I threw 'em light, hovering
These fake rappers can't really kno I'm loving it
You feeling it?
3rd verse:
What y'all ain't heard that S.K. got it
This Ace of Spade will have your favorite rappers table watching
I keep it tight for all the nights my mama showed support
She saw me dreaming but my scheming, that was low of course, right?
You see them dreams that I used to have, was really nightmares that I needed to be shooting past
Man y'all don't feel me, but the joints kno what we about
Long as the denim is expensive I can peel her out
I'm so confused, ok I'm getting weeded now
And I don't smoke but off these hopes I might need that now
Like just once in a blue with a biddie in the room
And she's rolling up a rello for my sober mind to cut through
We start to blow it down, her eyes low but they telling me to stroke her out
I free my mind, free her body, then I close the round
Take one more toke then that haze alone now
It got me going, for real",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-feeling-lyrics
Henny Black,Theo vs J.J. (Dreams vs. Reality),2012.0,"I never brag how real I keep it
Cause it's the best secret
Nah I kinda do
Shit who better to speak it
And who to be it then the inherited reason
In seeing a corner and the corners they bury beneath it
Polo'd down in Polo downs
Shit could be 20 degrees Yankee logo crowns
Be on regardless
Ears turn red when they frostbit
But we be in them Rovers we don't know what that frost is
Or maybe we do
Dreaming big enough to maybe pursue
And believing in it like maybe we knew
Knew enough to want to know more
You newcomers be new enough to where we don't y'all
But bet you that you know ours
Ours being all of us
Down till they offin' us
Know the detailing of the story and the moral of
And all of it is all that it may seem
I went on a world tour and went home to the same fiends

I promise I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
My Henny Black, my brim is Grey
I'm in a place where no one will ever get to chase
And pouring now for anybody who feel a way
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate
My Henny Black, my brim is Grey
I'm in a place where no one will ever get to chase
And pouring now for anybody who feel a way

Be as it may, you follow me for the day
And find a line full of writers that write to me in they Dre's
The beat, goes on you find the key that it plays
Like it's sitting in the trunk and you tryin to be out the way like
Out the way of the uniform and true to form
I resented how I get it, no tap, truly yours
I mean, wise mean build and destroy
We grew up down the block from where the buildings employed
But skip the avoids
We livin in
Nothin that no one was ever kicking in
Maybe they attempted but none of them got the pit of it
Picture me, living off the way that we was livin it
And all of this from looking out the window
And then you can say you heard S-K
Pulled up in the fresh Grape
And hopped out with the Eggplant Foams like checkmate (ha)
And all of it is all that it may seem
I went on a world tour and went home to the same fiends",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-henny-black-lyrics
All Black Walls,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I just wanted an Ernie Barnes
Name dropping ain't a problem if it turn you on
Looking for supplies make you ride til the curtain's drawn
Liquor store plans that dwindle down into murder warrants
I'm JJ Evans in a Louis belt
Balmain jeans loose enough to keep a shooter's help
And I swear they keep telling me to remind y'all
That they don't read blogs unless it helps 'em to find y'all
And those is the guys that I call friends
That's looking for thick bitches inside of a small Benz, and me?
Outside of my door was style wars
But behind it was limiteds that covered the house walls, and me?
I'm 50/50 as far as how I was drawn
So whether we in the lobby or black tie the ball
I'm just as good on the first as I am on the last
I grew up knowing the first like I planted the stash
I grew up knowing the worst with my hands on the dash
Of a Rover
I learned French and learned soda
A meeting of the 2, made it easier to move
Conversing with a mirror like I'll leave it up to you
Same as I always did it, what's the wonder for?
Lived up to all your predictions and shook the wonder off
All black walls, the living room will astound you
Covet that wall, it somersaults in value, right?
I just wanted Kadir Nelsons
And when he did paintings for Jeter I clear helped him
You're welcome, now I'm looking at 10 of those
The crib get appraised its a gallery within a home
I wanted Leroy Campbells
His spot was around the corner
My pops spent money on him
The blocks that I was walking
Was black art and black hearts, black bags of black gas was by the stash mark
And now the scene replays
A couple Kenneth Gatewoods
A couple TTKs, go!
Name dropping ain't a problem if it turn you on
Everybody talking Ellis Wilson once they heard the song
On the steps
Watching Biggie in the lex
The same one Nas mentioned
Passenger side Kim and
Growing up tryna mimic
That was us, that a must
Dating rich broads, turned Sports Center, batter up
Google turns rumors to reporters at your door
While your phone going stupid, wrong numbers talking raw, chill!
Thinking I just want a Picasso
Nobody can fade him, 4th member of The Lox flow
PJs in the morn, hard rock suites
10 cases of spade, 6 bottles in each, right?
Really there's nothing I wasn't in for
So to label me a backpacker is an insult, right!
Told 'em I just wanted it all
All black walls, I did it just how you thought, muhfuckers

All black walls, all green pockets
Ain't nobody complaining cause can't nobody stop it, nah

The Usual Politics,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"Verse 1:
We used to catch them, skating thru the town, putting it down, knew the M.O
The window was low enough for them to throw out a signal
From watching how they made it, to Tryna find out way in
Praying for one became just as common as saying grace is
Imagine if you will how happiness gets fulfilled
From deals that get you caged and actions that get you killed
My life is based on sacrifices, either these lights get
Bright enough or ima have to break something down
See what my mind do?
It built me where it kills me in light of its own survival
For real, ironic ain't it tho?, how shit became at home
Made us go outside until all we'd want is to make it home
Decisions decisions, and what I'm here to get is a given
But given where I'm at to get in position is like
The price of Louis got me, deeper than ever
And just think, boosters is getting fewer by the day right?
Verse 2:
I took a drawing to the jewelers from a girl I went to school with
And asked him what it would take to show the world the way I'm moving
He said, ""give me a week and you won't even have to speak
They say the walls are the pinkest when the diamonds are the bluest""
My bad, pardon me for being harsh or abrasive
I'm just explaining the drive we was on to try to make it
Jeweler man, he knew it, I got the stories to prove it
Back when I had the 2 door, tearing the conduit
See me?, I'm taking wages wit my neighbors just in case
Bron have a major night off, that's new money
I blew money on bottles while standing next to the rappers who had deals
With budgets on stand still, it really happened
My pinky ring became a star to them up in the stands
My joint was acting like somebody might cut off my hand
Not in this life, that's right
FGR, we keep it tight
Verse 3:
You feel my triumph, never, you feel my pain, you lying
Tuck that away cause I am, the best you haven't heard
But all your favorites have, and that's the tug of war
You let them tell it I'm the best long as you close the door
Sucking me in like a vacuum, but still I'm low
My Capricorn tendencies make me frigid cold
In '99 like, me and mine like
It's whatever on this rise 'long as this elevator's sublime
I wear black a lot, dress code back a block
And Jordan gave me these cigars, go ahead and crack your box
Vividly (vivid-ly) my vision
Came to for the win but my mind got me panicking the ending
Looking for a 'mil, a Lauren London with wheels
But I already got a phone full of those, Brooklyn know
Ain't no stopping the Bel Aire Rose from popping

And I'm plannin' on this Henny to be Black
That's the plan
And she standin' on the table like she paid for it to be there

Past it

Each way to the part
Got a trail of it there
See I made it beyond
But I'm braille over there
See ya way through the dark
Like a rail over there
I lead the way and be gone
That be all
Did what I could
No steps to it
Kept it just the way it was when you get to it
None of it is altered
Wonder what to call it
Call it the exact baby
None of what they offered
Call it the react
Maybe all that you was wanting
Was wrapped underneath you
And that could at least do
The prove when you need it
And you wouldn't believe it
I was defining the word and shooting through the reason
I was provided the urge to use it how you see it
Blame it on the hindsight
Knew it then you keep it
Spoils to the victor
Draw em' out the picture
Know that the allure is a fixture
Until it all goes

Said that this was all that they all know
Everything they wants what they call fo'
Never know you gone til you almost
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes
Puttin' somethin' on it til it all goes
Say you never know you gone til you almost

Another scar I sook to mind
Look beyond what took LeBron
To newer heights then look behind
And see a duffle bag
It's fully of Nike money

Why study
I dropped out
Ain't life funny
Suddenly you lookin' down at the street
From a flight that just peeked
And all the lights look gray

The way I define quiet but to whoever try and riot I kno the gun slingers well
One pump and then they fell is how we saw it where I'm from
But know that everything is mum so we ain't saw not a one
Not a scene, but believe if we needed to repeat
It's nothing for us to go for what know and the delete
I mean, money showed us that it make the world go round
Neighbors got it off of 9-5's or 4 pounds
Everything is numbers
And a 4.6 is really everything we wanted, it's whatever in this running
My team, Brooklyn through Queens, got it sewn by the seams
Forgive 'em for delivering the leans
Brothers where no one can cut us
Had to turn away when Avon and String gave up one another

Driven for dollars and bitches that swallow

Duly Noted,Milestones,2020.0,"Duly noted and taking notes, even when I ain't realise I was doing so
Didn't realize I was just remembering while I was figuring
What all this was supposed to mean, and I mean
The meaning behind it was what he said all this was worth
All this was just so that there'd be some kinda meaning when mentioning me
Or mentioning my brothers beside me, cause you see
This all could've went another route
This all could've just turned into turn on whatever
And see the same turn that was predicted for when it was my turn, so I turned
Turned into what I wasn't supposed to
Turned into what everyone around us said we'd never get close to
But I ain't turn cause I chose to, I turned cause yo I ain't have a choice
Because a choice was made long ago
That being something other than who and what was around us was the road I was taking
They called it the road less traveled, I called it the only road I knew
Cause I knew what my day ones didn't
Call it privilege or call it blessings from the ceiling but it all was a given
Without taking for granted what I was given, I was driven to a rhythm
That said these mu'fuckas is waiting for you to lose your position, so watch how you pivot
Watch how you scrimmage, watch who you team up with and what's their vision, you get it?
Got it, and I ain't really do much I just, took a baton and ran with it
The same way I ran with who was shoulder to shoulder with me
Same view, same motive, same reasons for anyone to look our way and feel they know us
But the only difference is I had someone to tell me when to hold up
When to slow up, how to never let anyone speak on you before you get to show up
You lead the dialogue, you're the leader, so always look people in the eye
And never be afraid to ask or inquire unless you wanna run blind
And never respect anyone who don't feel the same for you and your kind
Celebrated, never tolerated, they'll either love it or hate it
So this is about me doing the same, me knowing that
If I can do for mine what was done for me then I can sleep comfortably
Because nothing won't be able to undo what I done did and same as it was for me
And nah, this ain't about putting down one, just lifting up another
This ain't about knocking those who ain't have who I had
This is more about all them never forgetting what that was like
And never wanting to repeat that type, never wanting to be that type, right
This is thanks to mine before me
And aiming to do the same for who came from off me
Hands folded together to make this shit work
That and more, but nothing less. Duly noted",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-duly-noted-lyrics

100 on the cure

So I'm critically acclaimed and underrated at the same time
Guessing they was leveling the playing field to stay alive
Bet that
Honestly speaking I ain't expect that
Or the penmanship would've taken a breath back

So this is my last hoo-rah
Before I fully move on

Did it in chains and linked it to where I grew from

The mufuckas you on?, well they was riding to it
I'm in a great space, my influence is spilling out
Shit I did on the salvation is what be winning now
Clock ran fast I never bothered to bring it back

My fans over impressed and my hands holding your breath
And I stand where you never can till you slow up your steps
Did it for whatever it meant and yet again
Flag waver put his best in the wind, that's all me
I made it beyond reach, uh, you see how I play the big role in the Stuy like Radio Raheem
I never rock a nets logo on my jersey like Jay did
Or rock a leather kilt on stage like Kanye did
Let me know where all the pay is

The Truth About Regrets,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"Verse 1:
I'm from where they throw it all from crack to opium
In 3rd person, so if you Tryna see them
Then it's a call to make a call before you meet them
And even that's asking a lot without a lead in
I know the whole situation like a read in
Metamorphic when it change what you believe in
Told us everything could be ours if we just leap in
But said I'm too tall for shallow walls and so the deep end
Is where I should be reaching
Know what it comes with but damn if I don't need this
To be the way they preached it, they sermon seem the sweetest
Presented with a couple lanes, a couple ties
To where I'm lacing up a convo, embracing on this drive
I'm in a place where my demise can be memories from the top
Or memories of a spot where my memories should've popped
And with that, remember me as the centerpiece of the top
How I inspired your faves, it's bittersweet when they drop
And with that, if I should leave and then team with their kind
How can I, ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets this time
Verse 2:
As sure as this, earth is turning, pockets burning
We living it how we learned it
Shoot for the moments they showed us and move like they owe us
My moms crying on the inside, trying
To hide what she might fear, my timing is light years
In front of me, and what I wanna reach, should be up under me
But all this dream shit is a mess, so I digress
And I confess what I feared forever
Given the seats to these thrones keeping these chairs together
Rightfully so, and so, if you find yourself reminiscing, remember this one
When he was here no one could go where his pen was
But this was, never the way that they said it would be at all
So I'll put my morals by my jersey when I leave the court
And hope the next rookie here, eyes with a rookie stare
Gets to see more than they showed me when I looked in there
Time waits for no man can't turn back the hands when it's too late
Gotta learn to live with regrets",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-truth-about-regrets-lyrics

Cause he don't the stomach to hustle like Strike Dunham
And me
I'm from where we would open the fire hydrant
And put a can in the front it while we hidin' behind it
But seein' the speed of money will make you leave from the hydrant
And wanna be in the car that they respect and keep it dry
I can't
Change who I be
Not in the least bit
I'm here for the Jay money floor seat shit
I'm here for the Ye money and a sweet bitch
And inside my phones already an elite mix
So now I need the paper
The broads already been there
And none of em' is leavin' unless its to buy swim wear
Automatically I was givin' a top 10 chair
Or better yet took it
Waited til they was lookin'
And Debo'd whatever
Rewrote the headers
The top is never safe so I reload forever
Throne visions and loops of Otis Redding
Sittin' on the the dock of the bay

Statik Selektah
Welcome to Liberty City
The Chase Is On
Catch up, uh

Live out of Broker
Time for the close up
But I don’t do warnings
I surprise, like a hold up
Some through warning
I arrive when it slows up
On the stand still
I’m disguised like a poster
They don’t want no such
No pause no cut, No walk on it
It’s the same when it’s opened up
As it was when it was saraned
Too raw to ignore
So I done turned listeners to sands
Given up a hand is the obvi
Aimin’ for AQ
But feelin’ that’s behind me
Meaning that I’m probably
Attractin’ the hate
They’d rather see me in Alderney State
But I’m straight
I take all latin and turned it to all this
And these mothafuckas barely arms length
And I’m all in
So tell ‘em you can count mine
The chase on, I’m about mine
Let’s get it goin’

The chase is on, the chase is on
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
I get mine before the chase is done, see the chase is on
The chase is on, the chase is on
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
They chasin’ each other, while I’m chasin’ ones
I get mine before the chase is done, see the chase is on

I’m too accustomed to livin’ in my customs
On Touchy Tuesdays
They begged me to touch one
The city is mine and if its not
You couldn’t pay anybody to believe different
Ah, dead real
But still I’m, in it for the Liberty
The blinder’s on
So it’s harder to get to me
You don’t got to signal me
Homie I am cool
Heavy in the trunk
Comin’ Beat 102
When I keeps on the move
No dwindling down
Picture me surrenderin’ now and then delete it
Walk in my shoes
Let’s see if you fit ‘em
Too addicted to chicken palm and drusillas
I’m too much of a star
When I’m in Star Junction
For me to ever wanna go give up this
So, therefore add me to the lead
In the chase, and whatever I need
I’mma take it (you know)",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-chase-is-on-lyrics
The Don Cheadle Effect,The Power of Words,2009.0,"Clean-up hitter, I clean up pitchers
But they overlooking when voting who clean up quicker
My aim been the root of the discussion, moving is nothing
But I feel like when I move I’m a little to far in front'em
And when I try and level it, throw the booster steps in it
They right it off like I ain't jumping down to my neck in it
Yes I understand it, the curse side of the blessing
But you can see the remains of how I was addressing it

Best foot forward, so I guess I was leaping
I stress giving my all, but I guess they don't see it

Call me the king of the high toss, half of mine is fly gone
The other half is reachable if you reach to the sky for'em
Double meaning, but to me if I supply more
Then I gotta provide ya'll a blueprint to ride along
Pushed it to the corners of the paper they gave me
Till the only room left on it, is maybe to trace me
I can't say I didn't utilize everything that's true to I
Earned every part of my S.A.G card and I'm using mine

There ain't a hurdle I can't jump, a word that I can't pump
A scene that I can't script, a role that I can't run
I kept tipping my hat when I saw them proceed
Cause when you applauded for them, they applauded for me...you get it
So I feel like the fan fav of the fan fav's
Stubborn in my uttering, like fuck it, I can't change
And if that should mean, that my marathon is longer
Then I'll predict it now, marathon or be under


If they don't get it now, then I guess that they should breeze
The Salvation is tripling the records I release
And the crowd waiting is giving me the reference that I need
To refer you of any doubt towards the rep that I've achieved
I 24 times 3 them odded the even
No probable reason, cloud 9 was a weekend
And now it's been a year since I decided that seeing is believing
So think of my albums as painting ceilings


So whether it's Traitor or Ocean's Thirteen
Or maybe Talk to Me & I'm dressed as Petey Greene
Or it's Hotel Rwanda and I'm fulfilling the need
Or maybe this is Fame & my name is Henry Lee
Or I'm Montell in Traffic or Rain Over Me
Or Rebounding, I'm goat'n it, Meteor Man Gold'n it
Rat Pack tapping it or whatever the focus is
Just know that ain't nobody penning how I poet it

Best foot forward, so I guess I was leaping
I stress giving my all, but I guess they don't see it",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-don-cheadle-effect-lyrics
In Love With Living,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"Verse 1:
While I'm watching everybody watching my 1-2
My shit is butter so  I kicks that off the humble
I keep my head, both of them where if you come through
You get knowledge, give knowledge and then our run is through
I'm comfortable but I'm drained, I feel one in the same if that makes sense
And your kind can't blend in with mine if you play the fence
My pain wish it was quick to see
But hid it under gold chains for all your disbeliefs, like this is me
When it happened it never bothered me
Kept 'em on, badge of honor for you and yours to see
My squad and me was cashing out on who we wanted to be
If I was Shawn then A was Ty-Ty, arms in reach, that's all I need
'cause where we from got valleys and peaks
Black holes and glass roads to carry your dreams
Happy to leave cause off the way that we was raised, ain't no maybes in this lane
Aspirations took the wheel and we became who we portrayed
'illing for Currensy, saw B.I.G.'s road and yea it worried me
But my zip code need to be worry free
So I forget all that I knew, convenient amnesia
But I do remember how you looked seeing me with the Jeter's
Suites at the hard rock, see ya later
Sneaking outta STK, paparazzi on they're way up
This way the only way you'll be apart is if you're made
And we can have a pleasant time sipping Ace of Spade, what you say?
Verse 2:
My mind is infested with black excellence
That black out Range Rover looking like Precious
And I, channel my inner mid 90's for the Lexus'
Where throwing a wing on the back came off as heaven sent
God forgive us for all our harsh intentions
Our heroes was up the block and gorgeous cars was with them
My heart raced at the thought
When they was busting a U'ey the long way by the court
My innocence disappeared, I'm living within the glare of the shines that we saw
And now my vision is impaired with all these blinders on
You guessed it, manifested in intangible goods
And believe day after day I still stand where I stood
Rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
You remember us as living up to what they was talking
True this, these streets schooled us to spend our money foolish
The sneaker man and the jeweler was running thru us
Pause, I stepped it up another level like the looters
When the duplex is loaded and the drivers are the shooters
We pray at night like ""may the hype be a-alikes""
My PR's is cuffed over my Foams, they're laying right
For the win, for the now and forever
The outcome is mu'fuckas won't ever forget us
Dirty hands with dirtier plans cuz we need checks
But I'm connected to Gayle King over at CBS, you see me stressed right?",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-in-love-with-living-lyrics

J Dilla on the drums. Huh. Custom Made Entertainment. Let's go

They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
They don't want it
Nah, they don't want it (they don't want it)
 :
One for the money, two for bitties and pretty cars
Three for Hennessy, Dilla beats and Biggie bars
I rap better than whoever you got your paper on
And my kick game like Savion
Put it together, it's none better so they call me ""The Flow-er""
But y'all don't get the message till your check don't show up
Believe I send the word and your name's on all four
Internet game's like Paul Wall's
As far as my set go...
We blend with the drums like geckos
And Spalding bitches, we check hoes
Check two models at the same time, blowin' a bone
One black, one white, call it Oreo dome
I'm good
And y'all runnin' with your battery charged
But you look like a DeBarge and you sound like Marge
Get the fuck outta Dodge when we in the room
Tell 'em C.M.E.'s the dudes
At the end of the day...

 :
My introduction to rap with Nino's introduction to crack
If you move the work smarter you can double your stack
So I doubled my work load like the Carter was back
Then move bars like a prison attack
Tell them niggas get back
When grown folks talk and respect the speech
The rap MLK and I have A Dream
My squad seeing me, to spell y'all E.N.D
That's lights out for niggas who can't read
It's my air nigga, you can't breath
I inhale in the booth
The exhale will sound better than you
I'm light years way ahead of ya crew
And take orders from no man
My niggas tell you what to do
But here's a little bit of advice to use for the moment
You need to not fuck with the dudes that I roll with
Wrote it, spoke it, tote it and have 9th record it
I tried to give 'em a jewel, but Sky, they don't want it
Nah

 :
They say I ain't gettin' busy no more
My game stepped up, I elevated the floor
The bottom's lookin' thin, that's exactly where I'm from
So my heart won't forget cause the pain is within
This ain't a love song, this is the war zone
You better lace up your shoes, put your gloves on
I'm at 360 and I ain't turn the oven on
So that bullshit you callin' 'hot', there's nothin' to him
Think I got my back against the wall
Bodies all around it resembles a morgue
Last man standin', first man dumpin' with the cannon
Abandon, your ? should've canned him
Anybody that ask me about Sky or Tor's biz
They gon' go Up In Smoke like the tour did
And now you really hotter than you think
Osama Bin Yatta comma, the problem's in the ink
But they don't want it

 :
Back to business, flow ridiculous
Y'all know I'm sick with it
No antidote to fix the shit
The tradition is no form of switchin' shit
Do your crime, do your time, grown man business
Stack chips and all kinds of dividends
I let it rain, right where your river ends
Fast laneing in the whip, fast laneing with your bitch
Stack change till I get rich
I ain't playin', this is it
Cause Zeqway's on his bullshit
Your act's weak like Busta Rhymes in Full Clip
And when I speak, the whole streets asks ""Who's this?""
The black boy with stripes like Adidas kicks
You ain't seein' this and it's nothin' but G in this
And y'all pussy, nah, matter of fact y'all tuna fish
Yeah, I'm Slick, just a fact, I'm ruling this

I don't drink soda but my boy like's coke
I don't support his habit, but fuck it
If I can grab it at the bodega wholesale, I'd be retarded
If I don't cop it, it's the ghetto ass version of Target

On the ""Lift Off""
But I promise it's not gone go where you think its gone go though
It's goin' somewhere else
Just bare wit' it
Yea
Take it this far right?
Just like the hook say
Take it this far
Take it over there wit' it
Okay
 Skyzoo
We took over there
Across the street wit' it
They dissecting when I was just trynna eat wit' it
And my block like Sky whatever you need wit it
They tool on the tires like Bodie so if you creep wit' it
They on they whatever now
Never knew how never sounds
We ain't to used to never we just used to what they left around
Turned that into u-turns
Never planned an option
My block is full of u-turns
For every Nancy Botwin
Trynna be in this
I let it breathe a bit
And give you a bar to catch what I was leadin' wit'
To them I'm a star and I'm what they believing in
So given the odds I'm oddly what the even is
When I talk slang
Or when I encode it
It's all for where I hang
And where my zip code is
Cause all of us the same
So when I get a flow in
They know I'm givin' lane
Enough for us to float in
Range Rover ryhthm
I said it on the first
That's where I put the ceiling
Probably since birth
See I never planned on wearin' a book bag
Or however you put that
I was trynna cake and take it where they ain't took that
They misunderstood
They couldn't listen and look
But either way
They faves turned missing for good
So when I say
That I'm about digits and you get it and you bitchin'
You obviously didn't get it
Cause if you understood the background
You'd be wit it fam
It was either try to whip a verse or try to whip a scam
Said that I could write so I was writing for the kids who can't
I wrote on a desk and left it there like
There's ya chance
If you go to the schools that I went to
And you sit by the rack
There's a career on that desk
Just my way of giving back
And if you understand that one and you understand where that's from
You understand why I'm all Louis and what that does
Now Wikipedia and see where St. James is
I'm able to brag and say my neighbor was the greatest
I played for the flag and kept it wavin' through the mayhem
Now my neighbors will brag and say they neighbor is the greatest
Of the new
So fuck who's cosigned
Cause when we do toast bay we'll be toastin' mine
Mine dolo
They love you then then they hate you regardless whoever you are
They be trynna fuck up ya name like Chris Brussard
And I'm just trynna jump the through the rain
Get my move on
In and out of drops like no one you never knew pa
So pardon what I'm on
But I'm on it for a reason
Justifiably so
The so-and-so's that be speakin'
Is not at all in the like
So that comparin' them to me shit
Dikembe on the draw
Tell em' everything is defense
Take that how you want but I'm wanted by the elitist
And I'm just trynna take it where Bey is
You heard her right?

Who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce, stack cheddar forever
Live treacherous til it get to us
Doing what's best for us as far as today
Let tomorrow be tomorrow and tomorrow can wait
We need it now, need a sound that we can barter or chase
To be around what we around is solely on us to trace
And you call it how you see it, we call it a way
Or to ignore the allure beaming all in our face
But shit you offered a taste, and we wanted the recipe
Learn it and burn it before they get to reach
You feel me?, jealousy and slanted eyes wanted to kill me
Or at least spoke like it but no one approached like it
So yea, any stress in the air isn't from them
But it's more so my morse code building within
We talk low in wardrobe built for the wind and the win
Cause confetti can fall at any given
Hopes tell you get in, dreams tell you to stay awhile
If it all should fall apart before you take a bow
Then may the day being living proof that you made a way
My '01 was a Shawn Carter '88
Verse 2:
I want money like Cosby, who wouldn't?
Or at least raven symone the way raven symone was cooking
May have been wrong or I may have mistook it
But my intentions were to talk to you through song and sing how we looking
They showed us everything but looks deceive
They made a world to paint a world where only crooks can breathe
Then they dared us to take a breath and dared us to make a left
When the right after the lights was what they pushed beneath, you see
Shit I'm involved with got me pens and needles
Cause if this pen don't push the needle where I need to it'll be it'll be pens that bleed you
I'm here to tell shorty
It ain't all swell there's heaven then there's hell
That'll catch you once you fell shorty
We all fall it's just about where we land
And your heroes on all fours like they forgot how to stand
But the ones who stood tall be the ones who raised us
Forgive us for being stubborn, industries couldn't change us
And well, if that should hinder us from Tryna get a digit up
Then we'll just take it back to what we know and what the ceiling does

Get to gripping the corner and I'll be gone before you clear me to go
It'll be me, myself, and my Saturday night special
In a sea full of needles and habits that might bless you
I shape my fro and get back to the usual
Shit is Russian Roulette if I'm clappin' up through the crowd

Warehouse clears out right before the shipment peels
Another take down, hear they wanna get me killed
They're low until they get to me and then it get for real
They know that if it get to me I'm 38in' it
Hold these for trying to get away with it
Police is trying to get paid from it
That's paper bag money
But Cream Corn will get the scoop and lay the rap on me
Perhaps they was tryna trap on me
So Honey Bee is tryna clap for me

Counting Until It Hurts,Penny Series Pt. 2,UnKnown,"Tryna be counting until it hurts tho
Hash tag we keeping the money first flow
You work slow then you last as far as firsts go
Ivy league street raps I sorta birthed those
Never stepped foot on a step without my steps
Being in some sneakers that made you need to rewind yep
I was 18 in the dorms, getting pictures drawn
By the art majors of chains that I was spending on
Week later had that chain, went and hit the halls
Put it on your wiz while I tagged, I would christen broads
The perils of being young
Stair case wit a stripper I let her be who she want
Rewind to how I grew up, fast forward my new up
Caught in between corner dreams and hallelujahs
Waking up wit visions of credit card schemes
And then buying art with 'em off whoever lost these
The irony thats in that, where obviously I'm backed
By some guys that don't get it but got me if shit is packed
Shit changed, shit didn't
Show money on denim
The upscale vandals, the jeans they been Visvim
We was bound to be around what we around
So we roped off the circle from squares to keep 'em out
Spilling Spade on cool Greys
To your broad I'm Nas, to moms I'm Cool J
To your squad I'm the God, a product of two a days
And the closest to Shawn since the moment you knew Jay
At least that's what they put in their tweets
As well as the voices in front when I look up street

Only problem that we'll have is counting until it hurts

You know, throw some words at you
You can get a better understanding of where I'm coming from
And if not, I mean, I can’t say that I ain’t try

It go, It go

Baby girl, let me break it down to you
So you can’t say I was playing 'round with you
You a good catch for me in the long term
But as far as right now, Ma, I'm gon' swerve
And real talk, you don’t need to be dipped on
So I rather pull over the V before we get lost
You a hot one, girl, believe I’m a fan
But I don’t want you running round like you got a man
I’m only 23, with a lot of life in front of me
And there’s a lot of types I want to see
And I can’t give you my all
When part of me still want to answer my calls
You get it?
You speed racing and I'm trying to walk
I'm winded
Before I cheat, I rather turn it off, and end it
And matter of fact, you can rewind that
It’s more like a pause, call it an intermission

We still young, baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami, I'mma come back Mami
We still young, baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl

Swallow me whole, and buy me Prada’s
One named Britney
And all she want to do is come through
Do the one-two, blow a little sticky
Monica is cornbread fed, with stallion legs
Slim waist, rock deep cut Vicki's
And China with the caramel skin and the slanted eyes
Cherry red lips, taste like banana pie
Got a 'round the way girl named Daphne
She don’t even wait for the crib, we do the back seat
Then I got Jackie, I went and introduced her to Daphne
And now their favorite words is tag-team
Then there’s Tameka, she on that scream shit
And cooking turkey bacon, hash browns and Cheese grits
Then there’s Samantha, Jennifer, Sasha
Stephanie, Crystal, Erica, and Yolanda
You see?

We still young, baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami, I'mma come back Mami
We still young, baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami, I'mma come back Mami
We still young, baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami, I'mma come back Mami
We still young, baby girl
I want to be sure you the one, baby girl
So I got to move, and if this is true
Then I'mma come back Mami, I'mma come back Mami",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-come-back-lyrics
The Winner’s Circle,Live From the Tape Deck,2010.0,"(Verse 1)
Uh, tryna' to measure this out
And the checklist is everything they ready to doubt
And the skeptics is everything I left in the drought
I don't exit, I just get my letterin' out
Couple words on the curb I aim to boomerang
The burbs caught wind and signaled a newer lane
And I'm wit it, just know I'ma still do it the same
But I'm startin' to debate if I outgrew the frame
I'm tellin' myself nah, there's room at the edge
But the truth of it all is, I'm through with the ledge
All the records that I made and the goals I put in 'em
Hopin' that instead of just hearin' me they would listen
Only to be told that half of 'em didn't get it
The other half got it and carried it to the endin'
But I'm tryna' reflect what I'm tryna' protect
I'm tryna' arrive and they tryna' neglect
(Chorus)
But I get it, got it when they said it from the jump
Rings on the table like how many you want
And I'm wit it, positionin' is up something better
And play the winner's circle forever
Ok I get it, got it when they said it from the jump
Rings on the table like how many you want
And I'm wit it, positionin' is up something better
And play the winner's circle forever
(Verse 2)
An open letter to 'em all
A better understanding of everything I'm on
Labelin' me now is forever in the wrong
If they never understand it they never really saw what I kryloned up
So I'm sittin' here looking for ways to troop through this
The last thing I want you to think is it's cool losin'
Shake hands if the help is there
I mean, best at it but the shelf is bare
So the reality of this
Is tell David Stern I'm attracted to the chip, I'm playin' for that
And my game will stay the same, I'm workin' my prime
On the nightly I still give you 30 and 9
So I'm out here in Greenwich, buttoned-up image
My decision decided, bulls-eye winnin'
Boys and girls club, sittin' wit Jim Grey
The discussion is if I win will things change
Went above and beyond you can never doubt me
And this is tough but I'm taking my talents to South Beach
Could've stayed if I wanted to make this about me
It's more so for all of the people around me
Cuz winning is the most confusing of any virtue
And based off of the journey and what it earns you
We could be havin' a ball in this winner's circle
Mind made I hear what they tryna' say
(Chorus)

Okay

They say I rap like my parents was Olu Dara
Gloria Carter
Voletta Wallace
Cause the margin that I throw you started
Where if you caught it
I applaud you
Because no two starters
Can run you the 1 into 2 the way I float through the conference
I mean I'm
In royal blue with white stripes and a ""1"" in front
But ""45"" lurkin' behind like if you wanna jump
And if he tries
It's do or die
I'm up and under son
I turn heroes into posters on a one-and-done
Regretfully doin' so
The respect that I grew to know
Is still in tact
But shit is a wrap if you do approach
And listenin' back
You figured that that was where they blew they smoke
But givin' my track
The shit that I rap is like a sewer hole
Live from the curb lights
By left
Serve right
Easy pass club
They live and die for the turnpike
This holdin' on shit is gettin' out of control
Cause the Optimus Prime in me says Sentinel gotta go
I'm LeBron in July
I'm Melo in February
I'm alone in these confines
It feel like they've yet to hear me
""Clearer Hearing"" was in '09
I'm clearing near a gold mine
Ridin' at ya neck
Ear to ear call it Bow Tie
I give em a minute to get it
They get it they wit' it
Admittedly in it
Beginning to ending
Of what you remember
Remember the difference
Cause that shit is different
It's differently written
From sentence to sentence
And given the image
Of what you've been given
This shit is a Reynolds
And listenin' in is a privilege given
So get it then give it and go

Conversing On Coming Up,An Ode To Reasonable Doubt,2013.0,"Skyzoo Verse:
I was the shorty on the block always watching the Roc
How they would ride for town, I just wanted a spot
Felt like they had it all, hunger for standing tall
Next to who we saw as the greatest to whip up a bar
Fast forward to me becoming a king as well
Studying footage had me hooked and now I'm thinking sales
Started to make a few ends, but know just how I need it in here
'cause he playing with 600 M's
Seeing myself in his rise, I moved from Levi's
To PR's and APC'ed my regime
Then time start flying past and seeing where I be at
And hearing that I influence the newest of lobby rap
I see this kid who coming up and Tryna make a name
I hear a little a dose of me in how he paint his lane
He got his thing together
But I can tell off the way that he out here pushing ain't nobody do a thing to help him
I kno the story to the point where I feel like I wrote it
How mufuckas never loved us, they wanted us broken
Promise to always pay it forward if it comes to me
And shoot these lames outta the way before I cut a scene
I'm out here Tryna turn our sorrows into sweeter cash
I can help shorty blow out like Onika ass
Plus I can relive my rookie year thru this rookie guard

You riding the baseline I can school you how to leap
Right, one more time, back to it like a 3, rap to it like you need
Pass through and follow lead
There's nothing that they can say that I ain't do I ain't breed
If I'm cutting em out the way then shit I'm grooming out the league
Really you kno me well, back scoop on how it be
My bitch is a Lore'l, rack truly out they league
Lyrically I couldn't really name another
Only ones that I could name ran wit Dame or run above us
Either way I lead the way to what you make and how you love it
Nothing new it's just everything that you knew
Before you realized you was inside of a bigger loop
I tied 'em all together with visions of getting coupes
Mine was all cash, I fit it beside the stoop
Kept it one in the same
I'm looking outta the rear
Like look who following here but I'm never one to complain
Let 'em covet the lane like I covet the walls
Put my name over names getting up in the halls
Put my name over names, double line double time
I give you the clock twice and let you find what you can find
I give 'em the spotlight and tell 'em rhyme youngin' rhyme
They looking back up to me like what's the line, what's the line?
Feeding lines like I wrote 'em the script
Might as well when you see how they approaching they shit
My approach is everything that I know, and everything it left you
I mean it goes how it goes, ill let my friends tell you
Music for 'em like fuck everybody else
If you fan then you a friend and you fucking wit how we felt
Setting up a parade in advance is the plan

So the minute that I get in the mood, you're through!
I'm that dude, I came in the game to change shit
From the bass lines, to the slanguage
Just listen to the way that I make shit
The corner is mine, the co-signer dried up on the pavement
You see that? They tried to scrape it off
Can you believe that?
Shit is embedded for real, and I be that

I just ride around shining, like Pusha and them
And pull a ski-O, who look like she's Siamese
With New New
Swallow me whole, and say it tastes like Yoo-hoo
Woo!
Pardon me, but that just the shit that I be's on
And if you don't like it, then breeze Pa
But I still be on my block shit
Sunflower seeds by the boxes
Switch up top shit
It's something harder, similar to the Carter
Not the President, but the building where
They was moving product
And it's evident when I'm dipping
I'm dipping something proper
With a Paula Patton lookalike
I'm on my Brooklyn aight

And rap be actually more with the accordance in
Accordingly
I was calling leads bring the corners in
Stans in the stands
They pray I don't bring the chorus in
Cause me on 16 is pause-stop-pause again
King of the rewinds
Literally tree high
Sweeping up the rug shit is littered wit' weave lines
The life of missed calls where each one is a cab away

By the stall wit' it
On cross lights wit' the bartenders

Hometown heroes like you know where to find us
Looking over your shoulder like I'm slowing the ride up
First time listeners, they ain't know what a line was
Blue and orange everything, loaded the line up
Got 'em looking for lines like they hope they can tie up
A spoon full of 'ron when I shoot and give a bar
Give or take, I'm in a space that's usually regarded
For wakes or living aces, truthfully regardless
Look at who they telling me to par with
Pardon me though, bred different so I'm arguably so
You arguing over crowns dude arguably, no
I was fitted to wear that fitted and wear that living
For the living, you hear that penning? Well yeah, that did it

Young, early 90's in the heart of the K
Saw the servers, corners had targets for days
Any reason is a go, how they squeezing you should know
Draped in Columbia jackets, beepers and Girbauds
I mean, played lockers wit tomorro's front pagers
White and purple huaraches, tryin' to murder the lobby
I mean all we knew is what we saw first
Wheels up for whatever 'til it all works

The dude did it, been abusing the drums
When it's done, you won't believe what fiends do for a dub
I don't even get a chance to mix it without the handle it's twitchin'
Nose drippin', while they planning they fixes
Listen, I'm way deeper than that shit that you speak
And your so-called classics, I could pen in a week
But I ain't conceited
I'm all on the cocky side
With bitches leavin' the crib, doing the knock-kneed slide
What you know about it?
Homie, you slip with your girl, and I could show her 'bout it
I make your next top model do a show about it
And make a neo-soul broad write a poem about it
I'm from the land of the burner, so I don't roll without it
The borough with blue steel
Where times times changed, so now I'm sittin' on the stoop kills
But still, I'm that dude controlling the cabbage
And I don't got a bank card, just a hole in the mattress

Now turn it up
You gotta have your speakers bleedin'
Burnin' the highway, and then your Jeep is leanin'
Turn it up
Thirty-five cents, with intents
Twistin' that good piff, you in the hood bitch
Turn it up
Keep that system knockin'
Truck rattlin' hard, 'til the fender droppin'
Turn it up
What? Turn it up a little bit
Turn it up
What? Turn it up a little bit

I'm here to handle my business
Shit is easy I'm expanding the limits
In the throne, on the low, while I'm plantin' my pivot
I'm on the creep, creep
Plottin' on the seat that's open
You hear that beep beep, y'all better proceed to floatin'
My name heavy in your speakers, the dude got love
If I ran a race in the dark, I couldn't lose my buzz
See the flow is like cocaine sprinkled with propane
Gettin' straight down to the roots like Rogaine
I beg for anybody to differ
Try hollerin' back, and see how many won't be hollerin' witchya
When Skyzoo slide through, ain't a team comin' near him
Couldn't see me if we were standing between double mirrors
I lowered the bar to try helping you
And you still couldn't kiss my feet if you stood on 10 pedestals
The new breed who got somethin' to say
Flow flawless, and keep a bad slut on her way


Now put your hands together
For the dude that they call the crowd favorite
I'll breathe on the beat, and they callin' the foul flagrant
The savior of this game and I'm proud to say it
You got a song to prove me wrong? You can proudly play it
I speak bold, 'cause I speak from my left tit
And fuck the past, my motto is you're as good as your next hit
So fuck what your crew made
Y'all better get that Hennessy outta your veins and replace that shit with Kool Aid
Dudes try they hardest to sound hood
I threw a couple G's on my neck, and I don't say that to sound good
I say it cause it's true, homie
Please believe I mean it when I say I'm that dude

Think twice before saying a word
Think twice before playing a curd
Bodega
Yuh, the bodega
Yuh, the bodega

Yea, I used to own branded pop
Homie would give him half while, I jugged all his sandwiches
Saw the way the feds get cocky
Way they snatched my man when they cuffed 'em and handled 'em, it was fucking disgraceful
Right in front of the store
They shoved him on the floor, and they gave him a face-full
Burners in his teeth, with his rights, yelled at him
Spitting on his fit and holding 
Fuck is you doing, them tops cost
They all numbered, so they all need to be knocked off
And everybody on the Ave. just look at you, strapped
You acting like ya badge is bulletproof, relax
'Cus ain't nothing going on but the rent
Need a lil' crib so it only makes sense
Half the block got  time
And probably turned into high v, with a new sign and no clue
Welcome to any ghetto U.S.A
Get a heart, somewhere to start, and you gets paid, peep it
Let's get this money 'til it's all gone
Fuck the angel on your shoulder saying it's all wrong
'Cus cash counts, get that and bounce and keep a desert on you
First time outside, ya peoples better warn you
Huh, standing under the 
It's me and these flower seeds up to the mornin
In front of the bode- the bodega

Yuh, the bodega
Yuh, the bodega
Sun up, to sundown
Get your rep up here, so when you come around
Think twice before saying a word
Think twice before playing a curd
Bodega
Yuh, the bodega
Yuh, the bodega
Yuh, the bodega
Sun up, to sundown
Get your rep up here, so when you come around
Think twice before saying a word
Think twice before playing a curd
Bodega
Yuh, the bodega
Yuh, the bodega",https://genius.com/Skyzoo-the-bodega-lyrics
