White Lines (Dont Do It),Now Thats What I Call Music 3 [UK],UnKnown,"(White Lines) Visions, dreams of passion
(Blowing through my mind) And all the while I think of you
(High price) A very strange reaction
(For us to unwind) The more I see, the more I do
(Something like a phenomenon) Baby!
(Telling your body to come along, but white lines blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

Ticket to ride, white line highway
Tell all your friends, they can go my way
Pay your toll, sell your soul
Pound-for-pound costs more than gold
The longer you stay, the more you pay
Buy white line, go a long way
Either up your nose or through your vein
With nothing to gain except killing your brain

(Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Blow!)
Higher, baby
Get higher, baby!
Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)
Rang dang diggedy dang di-dang
Diggedy dang di-dang diggedy dang di-dang
(Pipeline) pure as the driven snow
(Connected to my mind) and now I'm having fun, baby!
(High price) it's getting kinda low
(Cause it makes you feel so nice) I need some one-on-one, baby!
(Don't let it blow your mind away) Baby!
(And go into your little hideaway cause white lines blow away)
(Blow! Rock it! Blow!)

A million magic crystals, painted pure and white
A multi-million dollars almost overnight
Twice as sweet as sugar
Twice as bitter as salt
And if you get hooked, baby
It's nobody else's fault, so don't do it!

(Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock! Freeze! Rock!)
(Ahhh) Higher, baby
(Ahhh) Get higher, baby!
(Ahhh) Get higher, baby!
And don't ever come down! (Freebase!)
(Dont you get too high) dont you get too high baby!
(Turns you on) you really turn me on and on
(Cause you gotta come down) my temperature is risin
(When the thrill is gone) no, I dont want you to go

A street kid gets arrested, gonna do some time
He got out three years from now just to commit more crime
A businessman is caught with 24 kilos
Hes out on bail and out of jail
And thats the way it goes, raah!
(Cane! Sugar! Cane! Sugar! Cane!)
Athletes rejected, governors corrected
Gangsters, thugs and smugglers are thoroughly respected
The money gets divided
The women get excited
Now Im broke and its no joke
Its hard as hell to fight it, dont buy it!

Little Jack Horner sitting on the corner
With no shoes and clothes
This ain't funny, but he took his money
And sniffed it up his nose
(Hey man, you wanna cop some blow?)
(Sure, what you got, dust, flakes or rocks?)
(I got China White, Mother of Pearl, Ivory Flake, What you need?)
(Well yeah, well let me check it out man, just let me get a freeze)
(Go ahead man, stuff I got should kill ya!)
(Yeah man th-thats thats raw, woah..)",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-white-lines-dont-do-it-lyrics
Message II (Survival),Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1982,"Survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

They smile in your face and they talk behind your back
And when you get the story, it's never exact
Some say, they're your friends but they really are not
Because they are only out to try and get what you've got
Survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

In jail they got a game and they call it survival
They run it down to you on your first arrival
They tell you what you can and what you cannot do
So if you ever go to jail, watch your ""mm-mm""
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

I went looking for a job, every day last week
But it turned into a crazy game of ""hide and seek""
Because every place that I seemed to look, a job wasn't there
I might as well apply for food-stamps or welfare
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

Like Hercules, your body is strong
But your mind is like the Devil, your ideals are wrong
You hurt people's feelings and mess with their minds
And have the nerve to call me brother and wave the peace sign
The young and the old, they all hate your sight
Because of people like you, they're scared to walk in the night
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

The problems of the world today are bigger than life
You have recessions and depressions, men are cheating on their wives
Babies born each morn' with parts of their bodies gone
Because of some crazy drug that their mothers was on
This country is fightin' not unitin'
Always putting each other down
Blacks and whites don't realize that they're really pink and brown
You got; gun-totin' cut-throats, stress and strife
And looking out for number one is a way of life
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

You've got to lock all your windows, chain up all your doors
To protect what's inside of your house's stores
Beware of the food, it might be no good
'Cause there's someone trying to poison the whole neighbourhood
Today they found something in somebody's door
They said, ""killed ten people and hurt four more""
You can't even trust a pill to make life easier when there's
Sudden death on your grocer's freezer
Survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

About to lose your mind because life is hard
And yet you believe in everything but God
Those pretty women, lots of money, yeah, that's alright
But don't you ever forget the man with the might
Now get a hold of yourself man, think positive
Because that's definitely the only way to live
Don't let you mind flow, like water from a cup
And don't you ever let me hear you say that you're giving up
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival

Remember: a child is born with no state of mind
He was blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but he's frowning too because only god knows what you'll go through
Survival, only the strong can survive
It's called survival and only the strong can survive
It's called survival in order to stay alive
It's called survival, survival, survival, survival",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-message-ii-survival-lyrics

Hip Hop!
Beat Street
The king of the beat
You see him rocking that beat from across the street
And Huh Huh!
Beat Street is a lesson too, because you can't let the Streets beat you!
Well a picture can express a thousand words to describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over, I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colours would swirl and the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand as far as the eyes are able to see, Ha!
I never knew art til I saw your face and there'll never be one to take your place
'Cause each and every time you touch the spray paint can
Michelangelo's soul controls your hand
Then serenades of blue and red and the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo of colours hang in tune, Man why oh why d'ya have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, where the good die young it's all thy must
'Cause as life must live, death must die and the tear shall fall from the living eye, Huh!
The teardrops fall for the state of mind of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead, and she still can't get you out of her head, Huh!
More tears fall for all you've done, trying to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed, put a shirt on his back and a roof overhead?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream of the beautiful cities in the islands genes?
When your works of art brought into being all that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the streets, abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are selling their bodies, and everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hanging out tough, rocking late at night, running wild in the town of the neon light
You either play some ball or stand in the hall Huh!
You gotta make something outta nothing at all
I'm sitting in the classroom learning the rules and it says you can't do graffiti in school
They can't be wrong in the hallowed hall, so my notebook turned into a brick wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three, and the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
'Cause I'm caught in the rat race, looking for my own space
There's gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky, and an eye for an eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweating from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, there's Huh, just us, Ha!
Still life urban masterpiece, your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released, and yet you got killed for nothing at all
So after this there'll be no more hard times, no more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you Hip Hops get on up, and let's take it to the top where we belong
'Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now c'mon, say 'Ho!' ('Ho!'), Say 'Ho!' ('Ho!')
And to let me know I'm rocking the microphone everybody say 'Ramo!' ('Ramo!')
'Ramo!' ('Ramo!')
Raah!
A newspaper burns in the sand, and the headlines say 'Man destroys Man!'
Extra! Extra! Read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire, the sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibis
And the foolish attempt to conquer the skies
Lost in space, and what is it worth, huh?
The president just forgot about Earth
Spending multi billions, and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran into zillions
There's gold in the street, and diamonds under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're living like mice
And the houses even make the ghetto look nice, Huh!
The water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
And people shout out in the darkest hour
Of sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims, and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused, Huh!
Minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lice's, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothing is sacred and nothing is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Hitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan
Napoleon, Castro, Mussolini and Begin
Ghengis Khan and the Shah of Iran
Mixed with the blood of the weaker man
The peoples in terror, the leaders made the error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
'Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
To learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
'Cause the Children of Man inherits the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say 'Oh yeah!' ('Oh yeah!')
'Oh yeah!' ('Oh yeah!')

You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
You have the right for an attorney
If you do not, or cannot afford an attorney
An attorney will be appointed to you - you are now under arrest
Crime, it pays real nice
But what you really didn't know that crime pays twice
It pays once in money, twice in years
In the jail cell, tryin to hide your tears
And the trip bad, cause you tried to get rich
In the graveyards, or in the shallow ditch
It's money or time so make up your mind
Vice (6X)  Vice, Vice
Vice (6X)  Vice, Vice

Fraud, the girl he adored
Turned out to be another dirty old broad
Took all the money, told all the lies
I heard she even, slept with other guys
Nothing she wouldn't do for a dollar or two
But every lie she told he knew to be true
He loves his honey, but she loved money
Vice (6X)
Talk about ya-yo, uhh, it's everywhere you go
They said in Miami it'll never snow
Now it's snow in the palm trees, snow on the sand
It snows all day, for sixty dollars a gram
Now they're strung out and high, hung out to dry
The air that they breathe the food that they buy
They think that they can fly, but that's a white lie

The mob, a full time job
Known to extort and steal or rob
Started as a hitman, lookin for wealth
And now he's the boss workin for his self
For all the blood money that he did earn
It made him take lives with no concern
But soon he would learn that next is his turn
Prostitution, it's a low down shame
How any girl, would wanna play that game
From pillow, to post, a sidewalk host
But the lady's got a condo out on the coast
She thought that the hole, was better than gold
Now she worked on her back til she got too old
Layin down on the job, has made her a slob, uhh
Vice (6X)
It's a stickup, so throw your hands in the air
And don't, ah put em down, keep em way up there
Just let me your wallet empty all your pockets
Got a itchy trigger finger and I'm gonna cock it
My eyes got wide as they pulled away
I said, ""Who are you the cops?""  He began to say
""No I'm Clint Eastwood, make my day... get in the car!""
Homicide is on the rise, and it's no surprise
The bums are in the alleyways tryin to take lives
People burglarize then suicidal criminals are never idle
Court procedures at your leisures eight finger Visas circle seizures
Con man fencer, arson is a trip
Take all the fingerprints, and give him the book
And then hope that the judge don't let him off the hook, uh!

The Message,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Duke Bootee)

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Broken glass everywhere
People pissin' on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with a baseball bat
I tried to get away but I couldn't get far
'cuz a man with a tow truck repossessed my car

Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh ha ha ha
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

Standin' on the front stoop hangin' out the window
Watchin' all the cars go by, roarin' as the breezes blow
Crazy lady, livin' in a bag
Eatin' outta garbage pails, used to be a fag hag
Said she'll dance the tango, skip the light fandango
A Zircon princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peep show watchin' all the creeps
So she can tell her stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got so so seditty
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own

Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh ha ha ha
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My brother's doin' bad, stole my mother's TV
Says she watches too much, it's just not healthy
""All My Children"" in the daytime, ""Dallas"" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors, they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
Can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacroiliac
A mid-range migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm goin' insane
I swear I might hijack a plane!

Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

My son said, Daddy, I don't wanna go to school
'cuz the teacher's a jerk, he must think I'm a fool
And all the kids smoke reefer, I think it'd be cheaper
If I just got a job, learned to be a street sweeper
Or dance to the beat, shuffle my feet
Wear a shirt and tie and run with the creeps
'cuz it's all about money, ain't a damn thing funny
You got to have a con in this land of milk and honey
They pushed that girl in front of the train
Took her to the doctor, sewed her arm on again
Stabbed that man right in his heart
Gave him a transplant for a brand new start
I can't walk through the park 'cuz it's crazy after dark
Keep my hand on my gun 'cuz they got me on the run
I feel like a outlaw, broke my last glass jaw
Hear them say ""You want some more?""
Livin' on a see-saw

Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Say what?
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under

A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smilin' on you but he's frownin' too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
You'll grow in the ghetto livin' second-rate
And your eyes will sing a song called deep hate
The places you play and where you stay
Looks like one great big alleyway
You'll admire all the number-book takers
Thugs, pimps and pushers and the big money-makers
Drivin' big cars, spendin' twenties and tens
And you'll wanna grow up to be just like them, huh
Smugglers, scramblers, burglars, gamblers
Pickpocket peddlers, even panhandlers
You say I'm cool, huh, I'm no fool
But then you wind up droppin' outta high school
Now you're unemployed, all non-void
Walkin' round like you're Pretty Boy Floyd
Turned stick-up kid, but look what you done did
Got sent up for a eight-year bid
Now your manhood is took and you're a Maytag
Spend the next two years as a undercover fag
Bein' used and abused to serve like hell
'til one day, you was found hung dead in the cell
It was plain to see that your life was lost
You was cold and your body swung back and forth
But now your eyes sing the sad, sad song
Of how you lived so fast and died so young so...

Don't push me 'cuz I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head
Uh huh huh huh huh
It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under
Huh, uh huh huh huh huh

I'm the King of the Streets Y'all
What, what, what are you?
What are you? What are you?
What, what, what are you?
What are you? What are you stupid?
To be bad to be born but born to be bad
The best emcee the mic ever had
I always was famous but never a star
A Don Juan, Perignon, Antoine, bourgeois
I'm bad without the big fancy cars
And the Louis Vuitton to the Yves St. Laurent
The higher echelon and the body guards
Not like Prince and Michael I come up hard
I'm the king of the streets I never meet my match
Hanging out in the Fever with AJ Scratch
People see me in the movies and on TV
But when they see me in the streets see that's the real me
So, throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you wanna' rock a beat with the King of the Street
Say Yeah!
The King, The King
What, what, what are you?
What are you? What are you stupid?
The King, The King
You know, you know, you know what I'm saying
The King, The King
What, what, what are you?
What are you? What are you stupid?
The King, The King
You know, you know, you know what I'm saying
Driving my car wearing my jewelry
You can fool the public but you can't fool me
Because you made a little album got a royalty check
But your friends don't give you no respect
Spending my money using my style
They wore my crown for a little while
They went all around the world thinking their all that
But when they saw me on the stage I took it right back
Cause I dress like a pimp and I work like a ho
And rappin' is the only life I know
I got respect on the street so wherever I go
And they only get respect when they doin' a show
Cause their young dumb try to get some
In the process forgot where they come from
But what they can't see while their running the game
Is that their friends and enemies are the same
Cause united we stand divided you fall
And I am love and love conquers all
I love to turn on the mic and rock the house
And come on everybody and help me turn it out
And just clap your hands to the beat y'all
And let's rock it with the king of the streets y'all
You know Melle Mel, you know I rock well
Say Yeah!
What, what, what, what
What, what, what are you stupid?
I'm here to take command
After I crush him I'm crushing his man
I'm gonna' gather his whole crew in a bunch
And give them all the Malachi crunch
And when I rock them for the people to see
I'm gonna kick down his door and rock his family
His girl, the nation, his whole generation
And I'll even give myself a rock sensation
Cause I never had a fight when I'm on the mic
I beat a bum like him up just the other night
When he opened his eyes all he could see
Was the referee, the ceiling and me
My name is Melvin Glover, I love to be a lover
I'm bad and I'm blessed
I can always rock a sucker, sucker, sucker MC on the microphone
So just give me the mic and get up off my throne
What, what, what, what are you
What, what, what, what are you stupid?
I grew up in the city streets
With holes in my clothes bummy shoes on my feet
Sometimes when I was hungry there was nothing to eat
And other times in the winter there was no heat
We would all freeze it was ten degrees
I would see my mother bow to her knees
She cried then nod then prayed to God
That times for the kids wouldn't be so hard
But out on the streets a life was rougher
The dream of getting rich made a man tougher
Twenty might get you forty, forty might get you eighty
Eighty for a lady that's five foot shady
Staying in the gutter hanging with my brother
My pop's got so drunk he use to stutter
Beat up on my mother, for no reason why
And to this day I try not to get high
The streets got it good so I should warn you
There's a drug store setup right on the corner
Selling dope, smoke, smack and crack a lack a lack
The sess mess splif or the chunk chunky black
Temptation reached for my vein
But I didn't let drugs overcome my brain
Because drugs rule the body and mess with your head
And makes you part of the living dead
But I went to school and I learned too good
I learned to understand all that I could
Thought I could skip a letter from l to z
So I took to the streets for my college degree
My teachers were the hustlers, garbage and bums
My class was survival and school was the slums
Math was counting money large candy no doubt
And my homework was knocking sucker niggas out
Gym was when I had to run from the cops
And history was who was on top
I would hear about the death of the neighborhood crooks
I didn't want to be in those history books
So I got myself legal as easy as pie
A legal crook got a suit and tie
Like a crooked politician selling dreams and lies
So he can rob you blind then tell you why
Get the most for less then pocket the rest
Kick backs, hit backs, invest your interest
Build a better bomb then raise the tax
You know the king would put the truth on wax
Because I'm the kind of king that'll open doors
Let me live my life and you live yours
Do what you wanna' do and don't hurt nobody
And come on everybody let's party that party
And throw your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
And everybody just freak with the King of the Street
Say Oh Yeah!",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-king-of-the-streets-lyrics

Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top
He proved that he can make it
So don't ever stop
Brothers stand together and let the whole world see
Our brother Jesse Jackson go down in history
So vote

Hypocrites just talkin trash
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Liberty and justice are a thing of the past
(Let's talk about Jesse)
They want a stronger nation at any cost
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Even if it means that everything will soon be lost
(His name is Jesse)

So for fast and friendly service - hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
And there's no need to be nervous - hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
He's changin our conditions - hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
So join the Rainbow Coalition - hey
Come on

World war 3 (the truth),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Life is a Game of Business
And in the end we sight (swear to god)
The new and old are bought and sold
And everybody thinks theyre right
War is a game of business
A game we shouldnt play (swear to god)
Cause men with guns killed all our sons
They blew us all away
They Called it
World (Paranoina!)
War (its Almost Over)
3 (Cause Nobody Hears what the People Say)
Realistcally the Bombs are ready
Technically, Nuclear by name
Capability of total Destruction
Radioactive death and flame
There is talk of a firey doom
Prophesied since the dawn of time
In a world of bloodshed, mass confusion
Killer diseases, Pollution and Crime
Man is in Conflict with nature
And that is why theres so much sin
Mother natures delicate balance will fix it so nobody wins
In World (Catastrofic)
War (Reaganomic)
3 (and nobody hears what the people say)
World (its Atomic)
War (catastrofic)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
A thousand miles away from home
A mortally wounded soldier dies
And on the blood stained battlefield
His life flashes before his eyes
Before he dies the man saw jesus
And jesus christ took his hand
And on the soldiers dying breath
The good lord took him to the promised land
Cause theres.. No (people living)
More (People Dying)
Pain (Everybody Disappeared)

Breakdown, Pain
1984, See the world at war
Your darkest fears of reality are knockin down your door
Drones and mutations, Clones and deviations
And theres no one that can escape the nuclear revelation
Because

The silver moon, the midnight stars, jupiter collides with mars
And out of the darkness spirits roar
To cast revenge on the earth once more
The leaders of the world are hypnotized
By wizards, dark and in disguise
Brought to earth by an evil hand
To devour souls in a brand new land
They let the leader think that war brings peace
And out come the one with the mark of the beast
Theres evil behind closed doors
In the year of 1984

Long ago and all too soon
2 different wars fought on the moon
One put (creators?) on it first
Then we blew futher in the universe
Both of these were nuclear wars
Breaking universal laws
Then falling stars and meteorites
Dropped to earth by day and night
Twisters, earthquakes, hurricanes
Volcanos, drops and torrential rain
Then one day, the UFOs
Came to see the whole world explode
We will pay the ultimate price
And a lesson is to be learned
When we play with nuclear fire
Everybodys gonna get burned

Pain! Pain! (so let the music play on)
Between the boundaries of time and space
Was the planet earth and the human race
A world alive and centuries old
With veins of diamonds, silver and gold
Snow capped mountains over looked the land
And the deep blue sea made love with the sand
Full grown strands of evergreen hair
Kissed the sky with a breath of air
Where exotic fish once swam in the sea
And the eagles soared in the sky so free
But the foolish clan that walked the land
Was the creature, that they called man
Theyre cannibalistic, paranoid fools
Tricking each other with games and rules
Training their men to kill and fight
Moving and stearing their mechanized might
Only thought that man had in mind
Was to conquer the world and the rest of mankind
And with the thought that they were right
They gave you permission to take a mans life
The ones you killed fought just as hard
Then you even had the nerve to pray to god
But god dont wanna hear all your mess
When you aint the one that he laid to rest
The devils children with no disgrace
Crushed and killed the human race
While they got rich off the games and war
What in the hell were you fighting for
A silly ass metal, a stupid parade
For all those innocent people you slaid
And after that, you couldnt even get a job
Cause fighting that war made you a slob
A seargeant and major, a corporal, Lieutenant
Titles and positions were all invented
You, and me, and all this mess
Are just a bunch of pieces in a game of chess
Its all the same, a third world war
A blood thirsty massacre just like before
Its genocide, three billion tears
Feeding on a war every twenty years
Then one day we heard the sound
Of the whole damn world tumbling down
Just one big boom, and what do you know
The world is a ghetto, high and low
Crumbling buildings all around
Mans creation burned to the ground
Chaos, panic, fear and pain
Days of radioactive rain
Grotesque figures burned alive
Miraculously seem to survive
Everything of reality is the science fiction on TV
Mutant dog and sabertoothed rats
Eat men with guns and baseball bats
The dead wont die, the (rudie?) wont cry
And everybodys asking the question why
Until swarms of millions walk from the city
And thousands more went underground below
With their head held down in their own pity
Wondering where, they do not know
Cause in this game we had a chance
But we blew it for cheap thrills and romance
Maybe one day well get another play
But until then remember what i say",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-world-war-3-the-truth-lyrics
Vice (From Miami Vice),Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1982,"Vice 
You have the right to remain silent
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law
You have the right for an attorney
If you do not, or cannot afford an attorney
An attorney will be appointed to you - you are now under arrest
Crime, it pays real nice
But what you really didn't know that crime pays twice
It pays once in money, twice in years
In the jail cell, tryin to hide your tears
And the trip bad, cause you tried to get rich
In the graveyards, or in the shallow ditch
It's money or time so make up your mind
Vice  (Miami!) Vice, Vice
Vice  (Miami!) Vice, Vice
Vice 
Fraud, the girl he adored
Turned out to be another dirty old broad
Took all the money, told all the lies
I heard she even, slept with other guys
Nothing she wouldn't do for a dollar or two
But every lie she told he knew to be true
He loves his honey, but she loved money
Vice 
Talk about ya-yo, uhh, it's everywhere you go
They said in Miami it'll never snow
Now it's snow in the palm trees, snow on the sand
It snows all day, for sixty dollars a gram
Now they're strung out and high, hung out to dry
The air that they breathe the food that they buy
They think that they can fly, but that's a white lie
Vice  (Miami!) vi-vi-vice, vi-vi-vi-vi-vice (Miami!)
Vice  Vice, Vice
Vice  Vice
Vice 
The mob, a full time job
Known to extort and steal or rob
Started as a hitman, lookin for wealth
And now he's the boss workin for his self
For all the blood money that he did earn
It made him take lives with no concern
But soon he would learn that next is his turn
Prostitution, it's a low down shame
How any girl, would wanna play that game
From pillow, to post, a sidewalk host
But the lady's got a condo out on the coast
She thought that the hole, was better than gold
Now she worked on her back til she got too old
Layin down on the job, has made her a slob, uhh
Vice 
It's a stickup, so throw your hands in the air
And don't, ah put em down, keep em way up there
Just let me your wallet empty all your pockets
Got a itchy trigger finger and I'm gonna cock it
My eyes got wide as they pulled away
I said, ""Who are you the cops?"" He began to say
""No I'm Clint Eastwood, make my day... get in the car!""
Homicide is on the rise, and it's no surprise
The bums are in the alleyways tryin to take lives
People burglarize then suicidal criminals are never idle
Court procedures at your leisures eight finger Visas circle seizures
Con man fencer, arson is a trip
Take all the fingerprints, and give him the book
And then hope that the judge don't let him off the hook, uh!

And I'm not your man
Spit so much poison that I got ptomaine
So much game, my game came with propane

Go for the cream, niggas sellin dope to the fiends
Young juvenile killers, jeans and white tees
Saying freeze, nobody can hear you scream
Little girl with a boy in the carriage left in the projects
Was meant to marinate in the madness
Trapped in a tragic apparatus, uneducated and black
With a lack of any marital status
Shorties listening to 50 Cent CD
Know it deeper than they ABCs, believing they can be OGs
Most of them were conceived in the back of a Jag or a SUV
Unless you be a athlete or a rap star
Youll master the art of realizing how black you are

What? Lifes a bitch? Talk about her, admit that
If you cant fuck with her, you cant fuck without her

Whos always pissing in the elevator
Caught in the crosshairs of the cops and crooks
The jooks kids fall between the cracks and nooks
I go to jail and its not a good look
Martha Stewart went to jail, she got a show
Shes writing a book

Writing the hook, Im thinking a song called Everybody, Lets Party

Go on and give your sister a chance
Dont be afraid of the word nigga
Be a strong, rich, proud, well-educated nigga
Dont ever turn your back on your people
Dont ever get so rich that they think you equal

Dont buy a 5X white tee without buying one that fits
Dont think that every platinum cut is a hit

To over 30 million poor people like me

Dragged my name down to the ground

And your amber ways of untold lies
Look at all the politicians tryin to do a job
But they can't help but look like the mob
Get up and get back, put it away

Cause now's the time to change the nation
But not with just another negotiation
He went to the East for human's rights
To free the lieutenant shot down in flight
Just another statistic, and the government knew it
They didn't even want the man to go do it
Before he left, he called the President's home
And Reagan didn't even answer the phone
But I tell you one thing that's a natural fact
You can bet he called Jesse when Jesse got back

He started on the bottom
Now he's on the top
He proved that he can make it
So don't ever stop
Brothers stand together and let the whole world see
Our brother Jesse Jackson go down in history
So vote

Hypocrites just talkin trash
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Liberty and justice are a thing of the past
(Let's talk about Jesse)
They want a stronger nation at any cost
(Let's talk about Jesse)
Even if it means that everything will soon be lost
(His name is Jesse)

So for fast and friendly service - hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
And there's no need to be nervous - hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
He's changin our conditions - hey
(Let's talk about Jesse)
So join the Rainbow Coalition - hey
Come on

Hate makers
Crack music
Sending out an all points bulletin-
Biggest nigga I've ever seen headed to Las Vegas
He's armed and extremely dangerous
Last seen in a black Benz playing rap music
(Chorus)
Guess I got one more road to follow
Guess I got one more pill to swallow
Guess I got one more silver dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
Guess I got one more nigga to choke out
Guess I got one more hole to poke out
Guess I got one more stolen dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
(Verse One)
The gun show shit on tracks like a hobo, nigga
Nice with the crew, even the dough low, nigga
Awe man, you just a homo, nigga
Bring a bitch back like I'm Bolo, nigga
Screwed your whole industry
Use my own imagery
Who? My own history
Ooh, she wanna get with me
Young broad, she hung George
She done sure
? The run talk got like cunt tore ?
Come one all I need is one more shot at a hendo
And I'm going in, yo
She came with ? titties and endo ?
Hitting shit
She dripping like a faucet
And she gonna thank the sperm bank for making a deposit
One more diamond is stable
One more baby daddy jaw wired up like cable
Maybe once I had one flaw
But never more
Hardcore, gun whore
Gun store, gun tour
(Chorus)
One more chick in the Phantom
And then I got one more stuck in the mansion
And then I got one more silver dollar
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
I guess I got one more deal to close out
I guess I got one more model to hose out
And she got one more pill to swallow
And you can't catch me I'm a midnight rider
(Verse Two)
? ...50 and L, my nigga
Ain't nobody fucking with Melle Mel, my nigga
Made Eminem, G, and T.I., nigga
The Klu Klux Clan can't believe I'm a nigga
You'll never be where I've been, motherfucker
Never been to jail, just a gym, motherfucker
Ahead of my time for 20 and motherfucker
Who am I? Where have you been, motherfucker?
My own security personnel in hell
Rest a million skulls
With Melle Mell, stories to tell
I'm the illest nigga you ever saw
And when I send you to hell
Here's a message for the devil
Tell him I send him one more trophy to set
Put your eyes in your shoes
Cause you didn't choose to watch your step
And because you wrote fucked up rhymes
Put your head in your ass
Now you got some hot shit on your mind
The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show, baby
The gun show, huh
The gun show, baby

Muscles got more broad tonight
Smacking rappers cause, God damn
I ran out of sluts to smack
Just one more drop in the bucket
Baby gave me some head
But it was dead
So I ain't all fucking
Got one more mountain to climb
Cause if the ground was mine
Only nigga that could rhyme would rhyme
This rap shit is easy as pie
You niggas high
Your gear is fly but I don't think they made it for guys
Talk about clothes
My dog got more clothes than you
Talk about flow
My broad got more flow than you
Talk about hoes
My hoes got more hoes than you
What about shows?
My cars get more showed than you
Limited edition nigga
While you kissing a nigga
I'm dissing a nigga
And you bitches are pissed at a nigga
All I need is one big score
And you cats can have rap
Gun flow
Back door
Gun show

One more chick in the Phantom
And then I got one more stuck in the mansion
And then I got one more silver dollar

Beat Street Breakdown,Beat Street (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) - Volume 1,1984,"Beat Street Breakdown
, rrrrhaa!
Beat Street, the king of the beat
You see him rockin' that beat from across the street
And huh-huh, Beat Street is a lesson, too
Because ah, you can't let the streets beat you
Uh!
Well, a picture can express a thousand words
To describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over
I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colors would swirl
And the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand
As far as the eyes are able to see, ha
I never knew art till I saw your face
And there'll never be one to take your place
'Cause each and every time you touch a spraypaint can
Michaelangelo's soul controls your hands
Then serenades of blue and red
And the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo colors playin' tunes
Man why oh why you'd have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Where the good die young is all thy must
'Cause as life must live death must die
And the tears shall fall from the living eye
Huh, teardrops fall for the state of mind
Of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead
And she still can't get you out of her head, huh
More tears fall for all you've done
Tried to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed
Put a shirt on his back and a roof over head?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream
Of the beautiful cities and the islands and streams
When your works of art brought into being
All that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the street
Abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are sellin' that body
And everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hangin' out tough rockin' late at night
Runnin wild in the town of the neon lights
You either play some ball or stand in the hall
Huh, you gotta make somethin' out of nothin' at all
I'm sittin' in the classroom learnin' the rules
And it says you can't do graffiti in school
That can't be wrong in the hallowed hall
So my notebook turned into a big wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three
And the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
'Cause I'm caught in a rat race lookin' for my own space
It gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky and a eye for a eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweatin' from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, it's, huh, just us
Still life urban masterpiece
Your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released
Huh, and yet you got killed for nothin' at all
So after this there'll be no more hard time
No more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you hip-hops, get on up
And let's take it to the top where we belong
Cause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now come on
And say hooo (Hooo)
Say hooo (Hooo)
And to let me know I'm rockin' the microphone
Everybody say Ramon (Ramon)
Ramon (Ramon)
Rrrrhaa!
A newspaper burns in the sand
And the headlines say 'Man Destroys Man'
Extra extra, read all the bad news
On the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire
The sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibies
And the foolish attempts to conquer the sky
Lost in space, and what is it worth?
Huh, the President just forgot about Earth
Spendin' multi-billions and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran in the zillions
There's gold in the street and there's diamond under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're livin' like mice
And their houses even make the ghetto look nice
Huh, the water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
A people shout out in the darkest hour
Sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused
Huh, minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lices, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothin' is sacred and nothin' is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Hitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan
Napoleon, Castro, Mussolini, and Begin
Genghis Khan and the Shah of Iran
Men spill the blood of the weaker man
The peoples in terror, the leaders made a error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
'Cause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
So learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
'Cause the children of Man inherit the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave em like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Oh yeah (Oh yeah)

Step Off,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1984,"Chrous:
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get lost because you know you're soft, uh-huh-huh
Step, step, step, step, step off
Because you got to get
 lost because you know you're soft

I was sittin' on the corner just a-wastin' my time
When I realised I was the king of the rhyme
I got on the microphone and what do you see?
Huh, the rest was my legacy
I was born to be the king of the 
be-bop
 swing
To have stallions and medallions, big diamond rings
I own a castle and a yacht, two million in gold
Because rap is the game that I control
I'm like Shakespeare, I'm a pioneer
Because I made rap somethin' people wanted to hear
See, before my reign, it was the same old same
""
To
 the bop with the bop"", that street-talk game
So if you ever, let me make this clear
If you ever think that we're steppin' out of here
You ever think you're gettin' up, down, around or in
Huh huh, you better think again, my friend
Because the door is closed and we're in town
And the only place you can go is dowwwwwwwwwwn!
(Oohweeoohweeoohweeooooooooooooooooooooooohh
Step, step, step, step, step off.)

Well, I'm Keith Cowboy and you're my cow
So what you MC's gonna do now?
It's gonna be a slaughter and here's my plan
You won't even get bread and water, my man
Gonna put you on the racks like a pair of slacks
With another wack rapper tied to your back
And if you wanna hang yourself out to dry
It's the beautiful round-up in the sky
I'm the carry-out kid when my trigger's in cock
I'll be carryin' out bodies stiff as a rock
Carryin' out a million dollars in my pockets and hand
But I carry out orders from no man
Cause anything you wanna do, I already did
You used to see me rock the house when you was a kid
But in my MC school, my class is packed
And 
tricks are for kids
 so I left your ass back
The bow-legged brother, there'll never be another
I buy a mansion for my mother
The 24/7, 
the Kool-Aid smile
Say, ""
Headcrack
 eleven and look at my pile.""
(Repeat chorus)

Come on
Now you know just who I am
And what I do because I'm in demand
Because I look good
Do you hear, my man?
And if you can't take that, you chump your old hand
One girl at a time gettin' MC
So how could you think that you rank with me?
If you only did your homework, you would surely find
When Scorp' get girls, they all be fine
And the only girl that you could take of mine
Is the one that I left way behind
And plus you're cheap, you're petty, your music is trash
You need to go to the bank and get some cash
Because talkin' don't pay, you're driftin' away
When I see you on the stage, I'm-a blow you away
You're right
There is no diff' between me and you
Except I look good and you look through
Take that
(Repeat last two lines of chorus)

Little pieces of a dream is all you mean
Since the day you stepped into the MC scene
Bitin' your moves, takin' fake awards
Sayin' everyone else is perpetratin' the frauds
But you're nothin' but a clone of a flesh and bone
Now you're tryin' to play gone on the microphone
But I tell you 'bout a night and you know I'm right
When you listen to us rockin' to the broad daylight
And then you looked in the sky and you started to cuss
But then you prayed to God that you could be like us
Then God was great and God was true
And he tried to show you how to be like you
But you still didn't get where you wanted to go
When you gathered in a group and got your own show
Cause without the source, the force won't survive
For eternity, the source is alive
You forgot the words of your creator
And now he's made you a perpetrator
Forever in a world of you and a girl
A few grams in a pipe to make your head swirl
You must spread the words of the master teacher
You die by the rhymes and the streets'll eat you
The words are a gift we will never flaunt
That's why we're gonna get everything we want
Just like a shadow in the night on a sight unseen
And I'm the bonafide vocal master supreme
And I'm here to run it down for the ladies and gents
For my rhymes make dollars plus they make sense
See, you're down with Cowboy, you'll be rockin' the show
With King Lou, Tommy Gun and, huh, Scorpio
Kami Kaze, Clayton Savage and Eazy Mike
And goin' down in the books is the king of the night
So if you're ever in a battle, I'm-a make you my slave
And I'm-a give you a shovel so you can dig a grave
Leave behind all your fame and wealth
So you can say one rhyme, then bury yourself, huh
I may sound possessed, but you know I'm blessed
With the will to make sense of all this mess
I'm the power of the sun that shines in the sky
And I'm the only MC that'll never die
So just rock and don't stop 'til you hit the top
But when you see Mellie Mel, you're gonna have to drop
ROCK!
And not only that
(Repeat first four lines of chorus)

And for all you MC's, you heard my story
On my super-fly, cold-crushin' fame and glory
How I rocked the children and the young ladies
I even rocked the country that was overseas
Cause I can rock anybody from any crew
Because I did it to Chaka, I'm-a do it to you
I'm-a show you how I rocked it, y'all, all night long
But when I rocked with Chaka Khan, I just said
""
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan
."", I said
""Let me rock you, that's all I wanna do
Chaka Khan, let me rock you, let me rock you, Chaka Khan."", I said
""Let me me rock you cause I feel for you
Chaka Khan, won't you tell me what you wanna do?
Do you feel for me the way I feel for you
Chaka Khan, let me tell you what I wanna do
I wanna love you, wanna hug you, wanna squeeze you too
So let me take me in your arms, let me fill you with my charms, Chaka
Cause you know that I'm the one to keep you warm, Chaka
I'll make you more than just a physical spell
I wanna rock you, Chaka baby, cause my name is Melle Mel.""
(Instrumental break)

Say what, y'all
Say what
To the DJ scratch, you met your match
Cause we're comin' out fresh with a brand new batch
So takin' you off into the galaxy
Is Vicious, Vicious, VICIOUS LEE!

Pump Me Up,Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five Greatest Hits,1984,"Come on, I said come on, I said come on

Rappers might be willin but they ain't able
Cause I was their king straight from my cradle
I screamed and hollered and shook my rattle
And dreamt of defeating them all in battle
There was no food in my silver spoon
So I grew up hard and I grew up soon
I'm a righteous king but I'm hungry too
And I eat up chumps that rap like you
Then I met this shark and his name was Jaws
He was biting my rhymes like y'all bite yours
I starting writing my rhymes the shark grew and grew
But I was writing more rhymes than the shark could chew
The shark got sick and then he exploded
Cause he didn't realize that my rhymes was loaded
They flew in the air and into the sea
And the whole universe knew that the king was me
Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel
And to all the fly girls I come off hard
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god
All my problems are small so my pockets are large
When I walk in the door Oh baby I'm in charge
Treat ladies like jewels and diamond rings
On my fingers on my arms on everything
On the streets oh my Jesus! I can't be beat
So don't ask where's the beef baby here is the meat
I'm gonna give you some soap a towel and a cup
Cause the bum emcees are all washed up
Put your women on the line with the rest of my crew
So I can make love to her and annihilate you
Pump, pump ( me up!) me what? (me up!)
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up!

I'm like the genie in your lamp
A face on your stamp
The hip hop rocker
The microphone champ
Got a knock out voice
Like a rolls royce
Gotta rank as number one
To be the people's choice
Cause you can hum a ding then you can hum a dong
Its just like the friendly game of ping pong
When you hitting the ball upside the paddle
It's just like cowboy riding on a saddle
Up above your head is the flash of light
Cause I can rock to the beat on any God given night
Like to rock like to roll like to entertain
While my car's outside you're waiting for the train
The train to the bus the bus to whatever
And I'm the type of MC to rock in any type of weather
I'm the bow legged brother there'll never be another
I bought a mansion for my mother
Come on, I said come on, I said come on

I got a certain cool that breaks the rules
That get me paid and a lot of jewels
And the women I'm calling day and night
That's proof I'm getting mine like a thief in the night
Because Scorp is known as the singer
The quiet storm that lover didn't linger
I will not change cause its in my blood
I'm like dynamite and you a rappin dud
And if the future is here in the making
Then why I can't be part of the taking
Cause you know I like cars and fancy women
That give me good love in the beginning
Bubble bath and candle lights
And girls saying Scorp you alright?
So stop standing there like you from above
And just relax yourself and get in this tub
Pump, pump, pump, pump me up
For all you beautiful people out there
If you having a good time, everybody scream!

I'm not a laser beam or a diamond mine
Or a platinum watch or some vintage wine
Not a pocket full of pearls I'm a oil well
Like black gold baby I'm Melle Mel
And to all the fly girls I come off hard
The slightest wink or nod makes me your god

The Truth,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"Rap is our way of life
That's why we do what we like
Born to rock the mic
Like E F Hutton
So don't say nothin'
Just listen

Yo, yo, I am the man called Scorpio
The one that's seen and never heard
But, all my sons just running their mouth
So, it's time for daddy to speak his words
You see, the biggest problem about all the MCs
Is I look good and they are ugly
While they always gettin' together saying I'm not cool
Their girls are out being my fools
'Cause I'm the first attractive exotic male
To walk around town with beads in his hair
To be stopped on the street by the people I meet
Saying ""Where you get your beads, 'cause you look so sweet?""
Hey, for any fellas that think I'm gay
I pull five girls right in your face
I'm not saying that I'm the playboy king
'Cause I didn't make it up but I made it swing
I spend more on spice than I do on clothes
So how could they front that they got gusto
There just barely make enough for a gram of blow
To start hoping and praying for their next show
But a brother like me, could rock it all day
I'm much smarter than that, in my own way
And you know what I'm saying is an actual fact
'Cause my Mercedes outside, where there's at?
(Born to rock the house!)

Hey, check me out while I roll my game
There's not another MC can make me feel shame
My name is Cowboy, not given no slack
I'm like 4-5-6, better known as headcrack
I've been rocking that party eight years of my life
Got shot with a gun and stabbed with a knife
Had to pay my dues, had to learn the rules
Had to separate the smart from all the fools
People talk behind my back and never to my face
But they make a clear path when I step in the place
I can make them clap their and hands and stomp their feet
Make 'em party to the rhythm seven days a week
Make 'em shiver and shake, just like a earthquake
Make the people dance, without a mistake
I can cruise around the world, all accross the nation
Get a big kick out of crowd participation
Make them hip to the hop and all that stuff
'Cause the other MCs know I'm just too much
My eyes are brown, my legs are bowed
I can tell a MC right where to go
I can get a young lady with the wave of my hand
I can stretch out long like a rubber band
Saying one for the treble and two for the bass
'Cause I'm Cowboy, to put a smile on your face
(Born to rock the house!)

K is for Kool, running through my veins
I got, ice water blood, so I show no shame
Intelligence is next, and that stands for I
Is something you inherit and you cannot buy
N is for night and for armor that shines
Slaying other MCs with vicious style rhymes
And G is for great to describe this man
My name is King Lou, I got a master plan
For the shores of Paris to the streets of Maine
There's a certain reputation I got to maintain
I got to, write the rhymes and say them well
And if I don't do that, I know I've failed
There's a few things I use to get me over
They all fit together like a four-leaf clover
First and most important is originality
You gotta be innovative, versatile as can be
Second on my list, you gotta know how to flake
You got to make the crowd yell, cause a major earthquake
Make 'em stop on the floor and scream for more
From the very first minute that you walk in the door, huh
Movin' right along to the end of the line
You gotta get a fly girl on your devine
Have 'em come to your shows wearin' nice fancy clothes
Looking sharp as a thorn on the stem of the rose
(Born to rock the house!)

Melle Mel is potent, super high-powered
To make other MCs feel devoured
Taught all the MCs, the birds and the bees
But they still can't get your young lady
I'm the legend in leather, the lord of the rhyme
If you can't see that, you must be blind
I always wear black and I always will
'Cause I'm dressing for your funeral, huh
Heads gonna roll and rappers gonna die
And whoever want to battle, I'mma give 'em a try
It ain't no pressure, you know I'm fresher
'Cause I was born to never be lesser
It's more than the record and the show to me
'Cause I came here to set the world free
From around the way, back in the days
We got beat so you can get paid
We made you a job, you two-bit slob
Now you don't have to work, murder, steal or rob
You got a little bit of fame and wealth
Now you think that you did it all by yourself, huh
I am you, but you ain't me
Beause you didn't start rocking 'til '83
Melle Mel is the best that will ever exist
And if I gotta be sucker, suck on this
(Born to rock the house!)
We're born, born, born, born
To rock you, girl
We're born, born, born, born
To rock the world
Ha, ha, ha, ha, huuh",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-the-truth-lyrics
World War III,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"1984: World War III

Life is a Game of Business
And in the end we fight (swear to god)
The new and old are bought and sold
And everybody thinks theyre right
War is a game of business
A game we shouldnt play (swear to god)
Cause men with guns killed all our sons
They blew us all away
They Called it
World (Paranoia!)
War (its Almost Over)
3 (Cause Nobody Hears what the People Say)
Realistically the Bombs are ready
Technically, Nuclear by name
Capability of total Destruction
Radioactive death and flame
There is talk of a fiery doom
Prophesied since the dawn of time
In a world of bloodshed, mass confusion
Killing, diseases, Pollution and Crime
Man is in Conflict with nature
And that is why theres so much sin
Mother natures delicate balance will fix it so nobody wins
In World (Catastrophic)
War (Reaganomics)
3 (and nobody hears what the people say)
World (its Atomic)
War (catastrophic)
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
A thousand miles away from home
A mortally wounded soldier dies
And on the blood stained battlefield
His life flashes before his eyes
Before he dies the man saw Jesus
And Jesus Christ took his hand
And on the soldiers dying breath
The good lord took him to the promised land
Cause theres.. No (people living)
More (People Dying)
Pain (Everybody Disappeared)

Breakdown, Pain
1984, See the world at war
Your darkest fears of reality are knockin down your door
Drones and mutations, Clones and deviations
And theres no one that can escape the nuclear revelation
Because

The silver moon, the midnight stars, jupiter collides with mars
And out of the darkness spirits roar
To cast revenge on the earth once more
The leaders of the world are hypnotized
By wizards, dark and in disguise
Brought to earth by an evil hand
To devour souls in a brand new land
They let the leader think that war brings peace
And out come the one with the mark of the beast
Theres evil behind closed doors
In the year of 1984

Long ago and all too soon
2 different wars fought on the moon
One put (creators?) on it first
Then we blew futher in the universe
Both of these were nuclear wars
Breaking universal laws
Then falling stars and meteorites
Dropped to earth by day and night
Twisters, earthquakes, hurricanes
Volcanos, drops and torrential rain
Then one day, the UFOs
Came to see the whole world explode
We will pay the ultimate price
And a lesson is to be learned
When we play with nuclear fire
Everybodys gonna get burned

Pain! Pain! (so let the music play on)
Between the boundaries of time and space
Was the planet earth and the human race
A world alive and centuries old
With veins of diamonds, silver and gold
Snow capped mountains over looked the land
And the deep blue sea made love with the sand
Full grown strands of evergreen hair
Kissed the sky with a breath of air
Where exotic fish once swam in the sea
And the eagles soared in the sky so free
But the foolish clan that walked the land
Was the creature, that they called man
Theyre cannibalistic, paranoid fools
Tricking each other with games and rules
Training their men to kill and fight
Moving and stearing their mechanized might
Only thought that man had in mind
Was to conquer the world and the rest of mankind
And with the thought that they were right
They gave you permission to take a mans life
The ones you killed fought just as hard
Then you even had the nerve to pray to god
But god dont wanna hear all your mess
When you aint the one that he laid to rest
The devils children with no disgrace
Crushed and killed the human race
While they got rich off the games and war
What in the hell were you fighting for
A silly ass metal, a stupid parade
For all those innocent people you slaid
And after that, you couldnt even get a job
Cause fighting that war made you a slob
A seargeant and major, a corporal, Lieutenant
Titles and positions were all invented
You, and me, and all this mess
Are just a bunch of pieces in a game of chess
Its all the same, a third world war
A blood thirsty massacre just like before
Its genocide, three billion tears
Feeding on a war every twenty years
Then one day we heard the sound
Of the whole damn world tumbling down
Just one big boom, and what do you know
The world is a ghetto, high and low
Crumbling buildings all around
Mans creation burned to the ground
Chaos, panic, fear and pain
Days of radioactive rain
Grotesque figures burned alive
Miraculously seem to survive
Everything of reality is the science fiction on TV
Mutant dog and sabertoothed rats
Eat men with guns and baseball bats
The dead wont die, the (rudie?) wont cry
And everybodys asking the question why
Until swarms of millions walk from the city
And thousands more went underground below
With their head held down in their own pity
Wondering where, they do not know
Cause in this game we had a chance
But we blew it for cheap thrills and romance
Maybe one day well get another play
But until then remember what i say",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-world-war-iii-lyrics
Beat Street,The Sugar Hill Records Story,UnKnown,"Beat Street Breakdown, Raah!
Hip Hop!
Beat Street
The king of the beat
You see him rocking that beat from across the street
And Huh Huh!
Beat Street is a lesson too, because you can't let the Streets beat you!
Well a picture can express a thousand words to describe all the beauty of life you give
And if the world was yours to do over, I know you'd paint a better place to live
Where the colours would swirl and the boys and girls can grow in peace and harmony
And where murals stand on walls so grand as far as the eyes are able to see, Ha!
I never knew art til I saw your face and there'll never be one to take your place
ÂCause each and every time you touch the spray paint can
Michelangelo's soul controls your hand
Then serenades of blue and red and the beauty of the rainbow fills your head
Crescendo of colours hang in tune, Man why oh why d'ya have to die so soon?
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, where the good die young it's all thy must
ÂCause as life must live, death must die and the tear shall fall from the living eye, Huh!
The teardrops fall for the state of mind of the beautiful lady that you left behind
In love and alone, but now you're dead, and she still can't get you out of her head, Huh!
More tears fall for all you've done, trying to be a good father to your only son
But now who's gonna make sure that he's fed, put a shirt on his back and a roof overhead?
Tell me who's gonna dream the impossible dream of the beautiful cities in the islands genes?
When your works of art brought into being all that the ghetto stopped you from seeing
Bums on the sidewalk, garbage in the streets, abandoned buildings, bricks of concrete
The ladies on the corner are selling their bodies, and everybody wants a part in that party
I'm hanging out tough, rocking late at night, running wild in the town of the neon light
You either play some ball or stand in the hall Huh!
You gotta make something outta nothing at all
I'm sitting in the classroom learning the rules and it says you can't do graffiti in school
They can't be wrong in the hallowed hall, so my notebook turned into a brick wall
The heart of a lion and the courage of three, and the mind of a man much wiser than me
You're the soul of the brother who won't come back
Who died in my arms on the railroad track
ÂCause I'm caught in the rat race, looking for my own space
There's gotta be a better place for you and me
There's pie in the sky, and an eye for an eye
Some people gotta die just to be free
You search for justice and what do you find?
You find just us on the unemployment line
You find just us sweating from dawn to dusk
There's no justice, there's Huh, just us, Ha!
Still life urban masterpiece, your trademark was written on trains and walls
A million dollar gift only God released, and yet you got killed for nothing at all
So after this there'll be no more hard times, no more bad times and no more pain
No more chump change, none of that bull
Just movies, museums and the hall of fame
So all you Hip Hops get on up, and let's take it to the top where we belong
ÂCause the age of the Beat Street wave is here
Everybody let's sing along, now c'mon, say âHo!' (âHo!'), Say âHo!' (âHo!')
And to let me know I'm rocking the microphone everybody say âRamo!' (âRamo!')
ÂRamo!' (âRamo!')
Raah!
A newspaper burns in the sand, and the headlines say âMan destroys Man!'
Extra! Extra! Read all the bad news on the war for peace that everybody would lose
The rise and fall, the last great empire, the sound of the whole world caught on fire
The ruthless struggle, the desperate gamble
The game that left the whole world in shambles
The cheats, the lies, the alibis
And the foolish attempt to conquer the skies
Lost in space, and what is it worth, huh?
The president just forgot about Earth
Spending multi billions, and maybe even trillions
The cost of weapons ran into zillions
There's gold in the street, and diamonds under feet
And the children in Africa don't even eat
Flies on their faces, they're living like mice
And the houses even make the ghetto look nice, Huh!
The water tastes funny, it's forever too sunny
And they work all month and don't make no money
A fight for power, a nuclear shower
And people shout out in the darkest hour
Of sights unseen and voices unheard
And finally the bomb gets the last word
Christians killed Muslims, and Germans killed Jews
And everybody's bodies are used and abused, Huh!
Minds are poisoned and souls are polluted
Superiority complex is deep rooted
Leeches and lice's, and people got prices
Egomaniacs control the self-righteous
Nothing is sacred and nothing is pure
So the revelation of death is our cure
Hitler and Caesar, Custer and Reagan
Napoleon, Castro, Mussolini and Begin
Ghengis Khan and the Shah of Iran
Mixed with the blood of the weaker man
The peoples in terror, the leaders made the error
And now they can't even look in the mirror
ÂCause we gotta suffer while things get rougher
And that's the reason why we got to get tougher
To learn from the past and work for the future
And don't be a slave to no computer
ÂCause the Children of Man inherits the land
And the future of the world is in your hands
So just throw your hands in the air
And wave âem like you just don't care
And if you believe that you're the future
Scream it out and say âOh yeah!' (âOh yeah!')
ÂOh yeah!' (âOh yeah!')

"White Lines, 89 - Part II (Dont Do It)",Piano,UnKnown,"White Lines '89 - Part II (Don't Do It)
Base, blow, base, blow

White Lines 1989, let's try it one more time
While you're standing on the crack line
Using one another
Eyes as wide as a manhole cover
Smoking like a chimney
Puffing like a dragon
Try to hold your breath too long
Now you're gagging
Try to tell yourself that you need a lift
Make a couple of lines and then (sniff!)
Sniff your world away, sniff your girl away
Sniff your life away, sniff your wife away
Sniff your money your gold and your friends
Your credit cards it's not very hard
Once you start it never ends
Blast off hands on the throttle
Basing chasing genies in a bottle
Make a wish but don't say it out loud
All you're gonna gain is pain in another cloud
Anticipation, the thing called crack is going to ruin the nation
Everyone is buying it and then trying it
You made your bed and lie in it
There is no denying it
I'm the drug you should do, but who's fooling who
You tried doing crack but crack is doing you
Base, blow, base, blow

Why did you put your life on the line?
Things were going fine until you played with those white lines
You're in and out of rehab
You put up a front for a month then you relapse
You're back out on the ave you're getting schemed
You need some blow some speed and indeed
You got a nosebleed
You let the blood run on, wipe it away
Then take another one on one, two on two
A hundred on a hundred
Wish it was more but then you already done it all
Even licked the ink off the dollar bill
You had a dollar bill, until you illed and sniffed overkill
It's still yearning, stomach churning, your nose is burning
You're coming down fast start to plummet
Pockets empty as Mother Hubbard's cupboard
Now you're turning to crime
And everything you own is mine all mine, boy
Fun baby... Don't do it! Don't do it!
Base, blow, base, blow

Standing on the corner, like Gotti
Work for Scotty you're a nobody
You met a girl, she's a straight up fiend
Give her a half of crack, she'll lick your nose clean
Slam bam for a quarter graham
Made you feel real, like a big man
Now you're ice cold, flash your bankroll, but
You're the lowest face on the totem pole
Sell to the brother that robbed their mother
That raped the sisters, murdered and killed one another's
Uncles, aunts, nephews and nieces
But for what, a few little pieces of crack?!
A few dollars and a nice set of wheels
Sucker you was born to lose you caught a raw deal
You're a marked man up to no good
Used by the mob to wreck your own neighborhood
And while most Italians get out on bail
You got dark skin, you're gonna rot in jail!
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans or Blacks
You get held back when you sell crack
Base, blow, base, blow

I met a lady, at a party
She had the nerve to say that she want my body
We moved and grooved, she removed, I was smooth
Took her to my room and she sure improved
Two hours later she put on her clothes
Right in my room she start to powder her nose
I told her it was wrong and she made it a joke
She said, ""My name is Pepsi, things go better with Coke""
Base, blow, base, blow

At the front door looking for a white line
And then O.D. off the right rhyme
On the dance floor at the disco
New York, L.A. to San Francisco
The white lines phenomenon goes on and on
Til your money is gone, til the break of dawn
I'm the stuff people love to love
White dove what dreams and nightmares are made of
The ultimate sin for the masses
It could be solid, liquid or gaseous
Powder form crystal whatever
I make you out think yourself, I'm that clever
Make you see things nearer hear clearer
Looking at me is staring down in a mirror and
Seeing the inner demon of your ego
You're a junkie, adios amigo
I left you cold, and your soul's in a black hole
Lo and behold I'm sex drugs and rock and roll
All combined and refined by the devil
To bring all society to my level
Just one more line is worth everything
Your car, your kids even your diamond ring
There's no debating, sniff some of this
You'll belong to satan
Base, blow, base, blow

On your hands and knees, on the floor
Searching, you want and need, got to have some more
You found a rock, tasted bitter
But it wasn't crack it was kitty litter
Executives and athletes
Taste the thrill of victory
The agony of defeat
Colombians will give you a taste
But there's nothing free about freebase
Base, blow, base, blow",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-white-lines-89-part-ii-dont-do-it-lyrics

Hustlers Convention,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"This record is dedicated to Kool Herc
Rrrrhh!

Three-card monte is the name of the game, we play in New York but it was made in Spain. Who said red like the rooster head? You pick the red you get all my bread, black you get no money back. Who see the red like that?
It's the one in the middle
Alright, my friend you got the red so you get all the bread, you see black you get no money back. We gonna try it again my friend 'til it has no end because the red card you win, the black card you lose, it all depends on the card that you choose. Alright, ten to get you twenty, twenty gets you forty, forty gets you eighty, then you can go out and get you a lady
Well I paid forty man I need a pretty lady
Okay it's the red card you win, the black card you lose. You see the hand is quicker than the eye so you must follow my hand my friend and not the card, how much you win?
It's that one right there
Okay, that's black you get no money back, get my money
, no man you cheated me! 
It was a full moon in the middle of June
In the summer of '79
I was young and cool and shot a bad game of pool
And hustled all the chumps I could find
Well now they called me Sport cause I pushed a boss short
And loved all the women to death
I partied hard and packed a mean rod
And could knock you out with a right or a left
I had learned to be cool while playing hooky from school
At the tender age of nine
And by the time I was eleven I could pad-roll seven
And down me a whole quart of wine
I was making it a point to smoke me a joint
At least once during the course of a day
And I was snorting scag while other kids played tag
And my elders went to church to pray
I've pitched pennies and downed bennies
And played the horses at the track
I've won at cards against tremendous odds
And my favorite game was Blackjack
I seldom lost cause my game was so boss
I mean I had my shit down pat
And I was running through freaks eight days a week
Cause that's where my heart was at
Yes I was a down stud's dream, a hustler supreme
There wasn't no game that I couldn't play
And if I caught a dude cheating, I would give him a beating
And I might even blow him away!
Stick-ups, muggers, drugs, in the ghetto
I grew up running wild, i wanted to be public enemy number one!
Little kids used to want to be like me but i always told them:
""Kid, if you live like me, you die like me""
I had so much money i didn't know what to do
I bought up everything and everybody i wanted
And when i got it i just choose to abuse it
 Sometimes wanting is better than having: You want it, you got it!
Yo, yo, who got it good?
Yo, i got it. I got joints, nickels, dimes, half-ounces, ounces, pounds, what you want? cocaine? i got twenty-fives, fifties, grands, eighths, quarters, ounces, kilos, what you want? dust? acid? i got ups, downs,  dope, mescaline, what you want, man, what you want?
Yo, you think i can get a loose joint?
Oh, man...
We took a hundred seventy-two grand
Between me and my man
And we was ready to retire for the rest of the day
But just when we was about to split
Four stick-up kids and Grit
Had plans on takin all our money away
So then I fire five rounds
And two dead bodies hit the ground
And I felt two slugs strike my bulletproof vest
And all that Grit would get
Was a bullet hole on his neck
To match the one i had blasted in his chest
Me and Spoon fled the scene
And they chased us in a limousine
'Til we realized some cats was chasing them and us
And them the flashing lights on top
Told us all that it were the cops
With the intentions of making a bust
I gave Spoon the vest
And fired shots at the rest
On the hopes that Spoon could get free
But the cops shot him in the face
And hit me twice below the waist
And then they started beating the hell out of me
When I came to i was all black and blue
In the hospital ward in jail
I was handcuffed to the bed
With a belly full of lead
And a two hundred thousand dollar bill
When I went to see the judge
The man's eyes didn't budge
He just looked me in my face and said this here
He said: ""Boy, all you gonna be is a menace to society, and that's why we gon' sentence you to the electric chair""
Before i was dead and my eyes popped out my head
I realized what type of petty hustler i had been
Because the real hustlers steal billions
From the unsuspecting millions
That's programmed to think they can win",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-hustlers-convention-lyrics

I bet I didn't know where I was going
But now I wish that I could find the words to say
""Come back to me honey, I love you more than yesterday""
(I love you more than, I love you more than)
(I love you more than yesterday)
Come back to me darling
For yesterday",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-yesterday-lyrics
At The Party,Grandmaster Melle Mel and the Furious Five,UnKnown,"Good evening
I go by the name of Keith Cowboy
I'm down with Grandmaster and The Furious Five
I'm from the Bronx New York and I wanna know how many people
Came out there to have a good time tonight
If you did please sing  and throw your right hand above your head
C'mon everybody, let's go to work now!

Doo-doo, doo-doo
Take a subway here tonight, we're gonna have a party
Doo-doo, doo-doo
Take a subway here tonight, we're gonna have a party
Here we are, having a good time, you and I, you and I
The music is nice and the atmosphere is out of sight
And I don't mind if you want to dance with someone else, with someone else
'Cause the idea is to have a real good time and be yourself
And that is why I'm tellin' you to party

Doo-doo, doo-doo
Take a subway here tonight, we're gonna have a party
Doo-doo, doo-doo
Take a subway here tonight, we're gonna have a party
Uh!
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Uh!
(With no strings attached oh baby
You're lookin' good to me
You're lookin' out of sight, you remind me of dynamite, ooh baby)
You'll be standin' next to you and I wondering if you're wanting (Wanting me, oh baby)
At least as just as half as much as I want you (You)
'Cause the night, the night of all nights, baby when I want to love you (I want to love you)
And now you turn around and smile 'cause everything's okay
And you know what that means
Girl we're gonna boogie tonight
Tonight
We're gonna boogie tonight, tonight, tonight
(So why don't you just listen girl?)
We're gonna boogie tonight
Tonight
We're gonna boogie tonight, tonight, tonight
(So leave me at the party)
We're gonna boogie tonight
Tonight
We're gonna boogie tonight, tonight, tonight
(And we'll have such a good time)
We're gonna boogie tonight
Tonight
Uh!
We're gonna boogie tonight, tonight, tonight
(So c'mon girl and let's wild out)
We're gonna boogie tonight
(Tonight)
Tonight
We're gonna boogie tonight, tonight, tonight
We're gonna boogie tonight",https://genius.com/Grandmaster-melle-mel-and-the-furious-five-at-the-party-lyrics
