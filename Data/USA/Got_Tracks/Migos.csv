Said, ""What you doing out here in L.A.?""
She on vacation but stripping in Tennessee
I got her number, asked her what she doing later
She said she would hit me on my cellular, (Cellular)
I knew she was digging my pimping
And new Christian Louboutin's forgot to mention. (Red bottoms!)
I brought that bitch in my facility
Told her, ""My favorite room in here's the kitchen, (In the kitchen)
After I whip all these chickens
I watch you get naked and wash all these dishes"", (Wash all these dishes, bitch!)
She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping (Huh?)
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double
Told that bitch, ""Pour your own muddy trouble""
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)
Shawty broke down and start telling her business
I said to lil' mama, ""You tripping
I don't give a fuck what you did, cause business is business."" (Business is business!)
So now we sitting in my condo, (Top floor!)
I don't even know what to say no more
She's telling me, telling me she don't wanna be a freak no more, but...

They know I'm on top of the pyramid
They know I'ma go down in Guinness
All this dab a nigga drippin'
Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
When a nigga start talking shit, gotta pipe up the ammunition

So now niggas dabbing, don't know how it happen

Don't forget bitch I'm the dab daddy
In stores now YRN fashion (Yung Rich Nation!)
Pipe it up, bitch it's gon' be the new anthem

Pull out the camo when you see me Christian Louboutin, hopping out that's an animal
Now remember, fore we made this song, nobody said pipe it up
Next thing we dropping, we gon' fuck em up, have everybody screaming pipe it up
Pipe it up in the club while I'm on drugs

And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket

Step out with a light dab I call it a jab
Michael Jordan I'm perfecting my craft
No money counter, count it up with my hands
Young nigga, I can show you how to do math
Sippin' on drank and I pour up some muddy
My nigga not tryin' to remember my past
Don't come to my hood if you ain't got a pass
Eat up the dab like linguini and crab
Mr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff
Watchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh (Haha)
Dabbin' is a way of fashion
Touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden

Nigga thinkin' that it's just a dance
When dabbin' is a way of fashion
See I'm tryin' to teach y'all the rules and regulations
Cause there's a lot of niggas out here perpetrating
No temptations, Migos sensation
Seen a lot of faces, why not make a Young Rich Nation",https://genius.com/Migos-look-at-my-dab-lyrics

Cross the Country,Rich Nigga Timeline,2014.0,"It's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas
It's DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline

Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch the leakin' (ba-bow)
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget (nah, for real)
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about? (Shit)
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low (hot)
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet (vet)
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check (do it)
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out ""Free Actavis""
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T, pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got Playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country

It's some dirt and hurt, but ain't perfect
And she gone always, come through
Hold me down, either good or bad
Never switch or act brand new
Go out your way and wasn't told to
So I made this song just for you

You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
Yeah, yeah

I put my heart and my soul in it
Get to the money, then double it
All of these bitches, they loving me
But you had my back from the other beef (Yeah)
She bending over, back for me
Made a deal that you wouldn't cross, lie to me
It was so many people that doubted me
Shit talk, shit talk, bullets start to let off
Jack Frost, Jack Frost, wrist cost a whole house
Blast off, blast off, my career gon' blast off
We don't need y'all, want y'all, we don't have to ask y'all
I been fucking on the nats, nigga, all day
Ride through the city, yeah, the ball way
We was trappin', cappin' all through the hallway
Everybody said that we would fall away
Nobody thought that we would go up
But we blew up, blew up, blew up
Fuckin' on a thot on the tour bus
Going out your way for the two of us

You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh

I mean all I ever wanted to be
Y'all know what we wanted to be
Uh, rich!

All I ever wanted was some motherfuckin' guala (Money)
Bando used to smell like some stinkin' enchiladas (Bando)
The streets is a jungle, got to watch for the koalas (Snoopers)
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Whole lot of ounces! (Whole lot)
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces

Walk around with large amounts of guala on me (Cash!)
I’m walking around with a pocket rocket, don’t run up on me lonely
Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts
Now I got the bitches, wanna fuck, they wanna cuddle up
Wanna come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me
I’m selling that kush to Asher, Rel Money, got a whole bag of Ashley
Money taller than mountains, drinking lean out of damn water fountains
She so bad gave me erection or eroused, whatever you call it
Bitch, me and my team been balling
Bet your label keep motherfucking calling
Woke up to a bitch this morning, got 16 new text message
10 of em' saying ""go get to the guap"", other 6 saying ""Migos up next""
G-g-g-g-gone!

When I was a kid all I wanted was a hundred dollar bill
Now I’m 19, young nigga want 100 mil
Selling whole things, want an ounce? Can't bust the seal
Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
In the Bando counting chips no poker, weighing bales of Okra
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists, menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me
Young nigga, I’m trapping and grinding
No scale for the workers, I'm eying it
You niggas still nickel and diming
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it

All I ever wanted was some motherfuckin' guala (Money)

Fuck the rap game cause these rap niggas really ain't shit
I hop in the Audi, I hop in the Bentley
Fuck it I’m smashing that bitch
Young rich nigga with the Rollie wrist
Trapping and capping, I’m selling the birdie
You fuck niggas really ain't serving
Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
Put the dope in the water, hit it with the egg beater
Sipping lean, yeah I'm good on tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tongue
She sucking and fucking, she ain’t got no manners
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping the babies
You niggas fugazi, my niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I’m the mayor, matter fact, I’m the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy, all of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

Throwin' money out the ceiling momma told me I'm ignant!
I'm two steps ahead of ya, never been regular
Hit a nigga with the antidope and we burry him
Hop in the Jag', I'm droppin' the top back
Smoking on gas like a nigga got cataracts
Duck ass nigga I'm calling you Aflac
Alley oop dunking them bricks it's a Shaq attack
Only one bird can bring the whole corner back
Mike Offset Vick, throw it like a quarterback

Running with that sack, Emmitt Smith
Deuce-deuce pocket rocket, Emmitt Smith
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
I just touched down on a pussy nigga
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith
Emmitt Smith, Emmitt-Emmitt Smith, Emmitt Smith

Pussy Ass Bitch (Freestyle),Streets on Lock 3,2014.0,"Pull up and wet up the city don't care about no feelings
I shoot at your children
Pull up and kill 'em don't care bout no feelings
I pop out and shoot at the city
I'm cooking big birds and chickens
I pull up with tons and tons of them midgets
I'm going far as the stars, are you afraid of heights?
The sky is my limit
You're bittersweet like a lemon
Hey I'ma move you up to Beverly but not the Center
Hey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like its tenders
The way I'm geek'd up don't know one of my members
Hannah Montana
, banging in red bandana
10 thousand dollars toe ring right inside of my sandals
My bitch understand us, she ride with the nana
She don't give no fuck 'bout no cameras (Bling bitch!)
She got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer
Plus she did trial in a Phantom (Rich bitch!)
Imma pull up leave it running, I walk in the club
Don't play I snuck the gun in
My bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy
She thought that I grabbed on my stomach
 
(tummy!)
Cook so much dope it startin to look just like comic
It could make a young kid vomit
Catch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics
I'm slick and ironic

I'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills
And I didn't give her nothing but a molly pill
I'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil
Me and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble
My pockets inflating like I blew a bubble
When the mixtape dropping Migo?
Young nigga just wait on it! You acting like undercover (12!)
In the kitchen and I'm whipping the pot
And it's getting thick on me like peanut butter (""Baw, glaw !"")
Short with the gwalla, I'm coming at you like the headhunter

Pull up on you and your people
Me and my Migos illegal but that choppa legal
Guiseppes Zanotti black and white, they zebras
Set the bitch off like I'm Queen Latifah
In Puerto Rico kicking it with Carlito
He put me on Chico he gave me a kilo
You fuck niggas taking my lingo
Pull up on you get my shit back like I'm repo
Thugger my brother we got different mothers
We fucking these bitches you cuffin' her
Bet you don't know she be sucking me while you've be kissing her!
Offset fucked her, Quavo fucked her, but you fucking that bitch with no rubber
These bitches be trippin', fucked all my brothers
And expect for me to love her!
 (I could never love her)

Pull up and I got the Tommy aim it at yo' head I turn it to an omelette
I'm connected like Vonage
 
I run to the money I'm faster than Sonic
You an informant I hang you like ornaments
Got pics in my mansion Mozart did the portraits
Got your bitch in the condo I'm all in her ovary
'Sace my chest out like I am with Jodeci
I'm a wizard with bricks, Harry Potter, do sorcery
I'm at the top and no nigga is over me
Run in yo' house like I'm Jeeper Creeper
Pour a 4 in the 2 liter
Christian Louboutin, walking on hyena
Straight out the trenches I use an egg-beater I whip up a beamer
Beat it like Tina, beat it like Jackson
I beat the pot my knuckle got a damn fracture
Add up the digits my nigga money on top of money, fractions
My niggas they all about action, no camera
Pull out the choppa, it hit yo' ass hard like the judge, with the hammer
You niggas is monkey
That's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana
These bitches be asking me questions like
'Offset why the hell you walking on mammals?'
Bitch because I am an animal
Watching me like I'm a channel
I got the white call it Pamela, Anderson
White Lambo Jennifer Aniston
Black diamonds, I call it African
Offset fresher than a mannequin
YRN plugged in with Rich Gang
We got plenty money, diamond chains

I drank a 4 and now I'm leanin'
She drank her a 4 and now we leanin'
I didn't even cry homie
How I feel when I lean...
How many, how many, how many, goin with me
How many Ms, I got circles
 ain't no Mickey Ds
Migos got a birdie of it
Throw away the cutlass get a Panoramic
Hey, Mama gotta mansion now she perfect
Spared my last mill but it turned out to be worth it
She just wanna do it for the Vine
She just wanna do it cause she know that she a dime
If you ain't got no rollie she do not waste her time

I guess they mad cause we young and rich
I guess they mad cause we fucked their bitch

First off B.I.G. may you rest in peace
Killed my nigga Pac and Biggie over jealousy
Vegetarian shooter, he gon' kill ‘bout that celery
Hollow tip that sang it for you, here, feel the melody
Niggas plottin' while I’m on vacation in Beverly
Offset told me press the button like the game of Jeopardy
I’m pressing it, niggas wanna hit me for my necklaces
Diamonds VVS, but that juug was never sent for
You either respect or like Nike, we checkin' you
You fuck nigga try me, my niggas go reckless
Never will you catch me naked, young Mel Gibson, kill lethal weapons
Stomping a fuck nigga out, with thousand dollar Giuseppe's
Boss shit, only boss niggas, in my section

I’m getting to that cheddar, my life is so better
Fuck nigga mad, ‘cause I’m a trendsetter
Chain got rocks so, I’m looking at your pebbles
I’m rocking the stage and I keep heavy metal
I got the ether like Nas, I’m strapped up with ammo and bombs
I’m telling my nigga go get you because of the money, it itching they palms
""Prrrm doom doom"" that’s a hundred round drum
On Sunday in church with my moms
I'm Asking the lord for forgiveness because he know the dirt that I've done

Don’t enter Atlanta without no permission
Leave ‘em stanking like chitlins
Got niggas that come threw your chimney
Like the Grinch that stole Christmas
Did a 8 month sentence, I did it, came home to the riches
You niggas ain’t relevant, pussy they pecking that melony
Offset the veteran, putting the pack on the measurement
You niggas got so much jealousy, I keep the pistol with felonies
Young nigga I'mma have to teach you a lesson
""Glaw! Glaw!"" Hit his ass with a Smith and Wesson
Can't go back to jail cause this shit is depressing

In Too Deep,The Green Files,2014.0,"I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
I'm in way too deep with the digits
Falling in love with the Benji's

So deep in the game I might drown
I play with the fishes, no flounder
I sip on the Actavis, it keep me grounded
I was missing one thing but I found it (Money!!!)
You niggas ain't shit
You wanna see a nigga fall
But I stand tall
Locked up behind the wall
Making county calls
Remember the time when my teacher said I wouldn't make it?
I'm hungry, I know that the M & M's coming, I taste it

I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep

Do not get drowned in the water
I don't wanna call her no more
Cause my niggas think I'm gone spoil her
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
I'm in way too deep with the digits
Falling in love with the Benji's

Too many little bitty bitches
And I know that she gone whip me something
She making profit in the kitchens
Me and Quan
We gotta run
Too many hoes in the studio
I hit lil' mama wit the switcheroo
Now she ride us like a rodeo
Aww man
They wanna boot up on that Molly, San-Tan
So we gave em a whole gram
She didn't wanna pop it
She told me she wanted to lick it off my hand
Damn

Young nigga in way too deep with her
Switcheroo yo' ho let me hit her
Ain't ate in a week, I need 3 dinners
3 piece, thick thighs no miss, winner
I'm in too deep like Omar epps
Where Nia Long at?
Keep calling my phone ion want dis bitch
You can have yo' ho back
Deep in some water
Fuck yo fish
I'm finna throw it back
Lame ass nigga gone go for that
Pistols showing, you know I'm strapped
I'm in too deep
And I ain't talkin' bout water baby
I met you at the trap house
I ain't have to take yo' order baby

I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas

She said ""Where we headed to? What we finna do?""
Whatever you wanna do
I said where you just came from?
She just came from a photoshoot
She ask me what's YRN
I said that mean Yung Rich Nation
That's another conversation

When you with me you can feel safe
Your hair, nails, and your bills paid

I'm not gon' feed you the wrong plate
Show you manners like my momma say
You might meet my momma just one day

Migo Dreams,No Label II,2014.0,"Started with a dollar and dream
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly

Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now

Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator

I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, ""give a nigga some faith""
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!

I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M&Ms)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say, bricks)

Dope dressed up in saran it look like the pope (pope)
And good smoke from the gas bags it'll make you choke
If you pour up, smoke or snort coke
That what float your boat (boat)
This No Label not uno not dos
Come from the goats

Chirpin’,Young Rich Niggas,2013.0,"It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' (brrrt-brrrrt)
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting

Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming ""Mama we made it!""
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'(brrrt-brrrrt)
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting",https://genius.com/Migos-chirpin-lyrics

When we walk in the club we the main attraction
Too much smoke in the room, breathing like Toni Braxton

My squad is so deep in the club, your fans and your people don't notice you
All of my niggas got diamonds, they flashin' they look like a photoshoot
I pull up in valet, the Audi got soft top but my top is bulletproof
And now they want jugg and finessin'
Now they want 'sace the necklace
At first we didn't expect it and now we expect it
At first the flow they neglect it and now they respect it
I'm thanking God for the blessing, (to not have a rat in my session)
I know that this game is dirty Smith and Wesson

Which one of my cars should I drive today? I don't know
(They all foreign)
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? I don't know
(They all bad)
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on

Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, we with it (whatever)
Whatever you with, whatever you with
My nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing no button
My niggas ain't stressing that money
Whatever you with, whatever you with
You know that my niggas we with it

You must got the rabies, you bite
You copy my swag and I like it
Young nigga I'm for sale
Give em' hell!
Put a nigga on a mission, young nigga won't fail
Ya'll pussy ass rappers, these niggas they wise
Never trap, never cap, never been in a trial
You with it, I'm with it, them hollows start spitting
These niggas they shaking like Diddy
Gotta pay to trap on my block, extortion
80 percent of your guap
No lie, Versace, it got me a fortune
Enormous money ain't never gone stop
Woke up this morning and I played the radio
Nigga's remedial, sounding like Radio
Them niggas not talking just pullin that cards
Dunk a nigga, Vince Carter
Bullets have a nigga dancing like Carlton

Which one of my cars should I drive today? I don't know
(They all foreign)
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? I don't know

Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on

Bars, bars, bars, 16 bars
16, (laughs) 16
I don’t know

You take the deuce of that yellow then drink it
I be like, “Damn, boy!” what is you thinking?
When I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I’m swinging
Walk in the Nawf, you know that they banging
(You know I got to pull up on the Nawfside one time)
Dope boy mentality, dope boy mentality
Walk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)
I feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada
Cause I still feel like people be after us (12!)
I got the chopper don’t challenge us
White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray (Ray Charles!)
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
(We straight!)

Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table steak and a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks

I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Muhammad Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra

When a nigga hit the plug
When a nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh
Hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it
Hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it
Hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it

Hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it (Hit it, hit it, hit it!)
Hit 'em with it (Hit, hit!)

Nigga talking crazy like he want to buck
Hit him with the uppercut, I make him knuckle up
Pull up in the Lamborghini Murcielago to
Make your bitch buckle up, turn me up
Sipping on poison ivy, but nigga check my double cup
My brothers know Isley, tweety bird tweeting in my Bentley truck
Nigga talking bout a check then Imma run it up
Shots fired at my sprinter bus, bap bap bap, graow
Nobody got hit, it was ten of us
Touch down at Coachella and they pulling up
Pick up the vector, then I point it up
Start busting, ain’t no need to load it
I hit the gas, take out their expedition truck

Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (Hit it!)
When a nigga hit the plug
When a nigga hit the trap and I hit 'em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit 'em with the uh
Hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it
Hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it, hit 'em with it

Say ""Where were you 3 o clock on the dot?"" ""My Momma's house"" ""You a goddamn liar""
Have you heard about your new worker? (Nah) Know I put him in your circle

Highway 85,Yung Rich Nation,2015.0,"Take it back to the nawfside
Migo N.W.A nigga

Woke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon
Hop in my Bimmer to see my moms, my mom started trippin' 'bout my stinkin ass bong
Stopped at the gas station, get it pumped by the bums
See some niggas I ain't like where I came from
I grabbed my Glock then I dialed one number
Tell my brother that I'm slipping and I'm in trouble
So the nigga I don't like made a move to the right
I grabbed the Glock and point it at him on sight
The nigga to the left told me put the gun down
BOW one round, Uh, its going down
I ran out the store, I can't believe I ain't hit
My migos pull up with macs and sticks
Rel hopped out and let 2 shots off
Then I looked around the corner it's Gwinnett County law
I rolled down the window, it's the officer
Put his nose in my car, and say he smell the herb
He opened up the door and asked me can he search?
Hell Naw, officer you know how much I'm worth?
I'm worth a million

High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time
High speed chase, going down 85
Blue and white lights on the north side
High speed chase, going down 85
Young nigga, I ain't trying to see no jail time

High Speed chase going down 29
Mama on my line sayin' I'm on Fox 5
I said ""you sure Ma?"" she said ""baby it's live""
I said ""Fuck twelve"" turn up the alpine
Rockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta
Got the 38 on me but this bitch kinda rusty
Fuck it i'ma shoot it, if it jam then I'm running
BOW BOW BOW BOW, crumping must be from Oakland
I ran through the cut, 12 chasin' me
Smoking on gas got the best of me
He getting so close, bout to tackle me
I turned around and emptied the clip, get from round me
It's fucked up, niggas in the hood they killing each other
And most of us got single parents, only a mother
Niggas in the kitchen whipping chickens, tryna get butter
Police on my ass cause the Budniks on the Cutlass
Police pull me over got the mac in the back
Wait till he get up out the car and hit the gas
High speed chase down 29
And if I get caught I'm gettin' a lifetime

Young nigga ain't trying to see no jail time

Once upon a time not long ago
3 amigos by the name of Offset Takeoff Quavo
Stayed on the north side, thats where anything goes
And if a nigga disrespect, he meet the funeral home
Wake up in the morning, thank him cause it's me that he chose
Migo Jerz at the bando with a fork in a bowl
My nigga called me at the park and said its getting too deep
Jumped in my R8 with ostrich seats and hit the streets
Ridin' down club drive feeling myself
I know the block is hot, I'm screaming fuck 12 sparking a spliff
My conscious telling me you tripping Takeoff think I see 12
Damn I shouldn't of served that nigga at the Shell
Now lemme tell you a riddle
Mirror mirror on the wall, what would you do if police told you pull over your car?
Mirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off?
The mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all
I see red and white blue lights as I look in my rear
Put the gas out, it's Friday and it's smokey in here
Fuck another high speed chase, that's when the hemi kick in
Forgive me for my sins, I ain't going back to the pen
It's gon be a...

A nigga still on the block
Selling them quarters and mention my niggas been dealing it

In Australia I'm the crocodile hunter
In Africa in the jungle

YRN 2 Intro,YRN 2 (Young Rich Niggas 2),2016.0,"Huh, turn the headphones up
I mean just a- yeah, yeah, you good
Let me turn these lights off
Let me fire up this cookie real quick
You know how we get it
Can’t find my lighter though
Migos
Young rich niggas
Young niggas been doing real boss shit
They know where they got this shit from
Came in the game kicking doors, fucking hoes, and rocking gold (Don't act like you don't know that shit nigga)
Now our pockets swoled (big racks)
Been having hoes (havin')
Been having niggas on go (havin')
For real (woop)
Ask about it

I’ma put on for my city (North)
You gon’ put on for these bitches
Young nigga I came from nothing
And now I’m at parties with Diddy
See at first they didn’t believe me
Now this shit coming way too easy
I’m with a paid assassin
Run to the money, we dashing (go get it)
We the ones came up with dabbing
We put ‘em on trap fashion
I made a play out in Athens
I’m whipping up Kylie Kardashian
Same niggas see me having
Used to be the same niggas laughing
Now my palm itching
Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Bao, bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu’fuckers say (shhh)
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pop an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap
Take her phone, she wanna snap
I don’t get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon’ run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon’ flush that lil pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That’s the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Droppin my top just to dump out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn’t have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando

Some niggas came in the game dancing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion
Ain’t talking ‘bout Donatella but we the most underrated rappers reppin’ and havin’
My niggas have a 30 plus a 30 in the vicinity literally (so that’s a 60)
I would give you names of these Migos clones but it’s every rapper in the industry (literally)
And they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don’t let us in they facility
Cause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me
Elmo, these niggas they tickle me
Drink codeine and trap out the embassy
Mama said niggas’ll envy me
Behind the lot shootin’ at my enemies
Quavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly
Drinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede
We brought that flow back when niggas didn’t know
People compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
I put my blood sweat and tears in the game
And I still got more years so I bet they’ll remember me
All of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays
When I start spitting I ball cause it’s inner me
Remember taking trips in the Infinity
Looking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin’s
(hot, hot), the block is sizzling
Gotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching
Who the fuck told ‘em north side wasn’t the trenches?
These niggas bitches, they want some attention
Niggas get put in detention
It ain’t my fault, nigga, it’s your decision
No presents up under your christmas tree
Cause I am the Grinch, stole christmas
Wonder why your children not watching Disney
Cause Migos we making a history
I bought twenty pints of Activis
You think I’m sellin’ em, but that’s just for me to sip it
If you don’t believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me

Offset!!
History repeat itself, I got locked up again
I came home to the Benjamin’s
As a young nigga they always envied me
You copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me’s
My necklace it cost me a brick a piece
Fuck the bitch so good I make the bitch’ knees weak
Dropped the top off the Bentley, it’s up to me
I sat on a milly while I was in custody
Picked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip
Double cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips
I’m that same nigga that jumped in the VIP
Lot of niggas pussy ‘cause they know that I’m a killer
Made a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental
We was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember
I really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing
Get hit with that stick and I bet you gon’ feel it
Pull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling
I see a nigga plotting, where my semi
I can whip me up a brick in a minute
Throw on 
Margiela
 one day, then 
Givenchy
Got the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen
Don’t care ‘bout no ho cause that money my mission
Chill Will want a body, his finger been itching
And my Ferrari got bricks by the engine
Don’t fuck with no rappers, these fuck niggas bitches
I’m not being friendly, I don’t want to kick it
Didn’t write no letter, you niggas ain’t visit
I took a plea, I said fuck it, I did it
YRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it
We back on our shit, you can’t fuck with us period
I see a million when I’m in the mirror
Get hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial
Hop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear
I got a shooter with me, he right here
I got your bitch suck my dick, on my Lear
Police be watching me like a premiere
Put that lil bitch on some molly
She ride on my dick like a trolley
All of my cars are exotic
Knock a nigga off, don’t get indicted",https://genius.com/Migos-yrn-2-intro-lyrics

Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I am a blessing and you are a curse
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don’t need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial so you know I'm innocent
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense

My brother caught 15 waiting for the pill
When a nigga broke, he coming at your throat
Tryna' sell the coke but it really is soap
My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough
Shit get real, nigga tried to kill
All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don’t give a fuck
Tryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck

Tryna get a profit, running to that money like Sonic

If its anotha' nigga I gotta remix it
Flipping them patties like Krabby's
My shoes is Prada's or Bally's

Everywhere I go they call me dab daddy

Flippin' dab like a acrobat
Flippin' it, flippin' it, flippin' 'em

Throw body parts on my Murciélago, pull up like Go Go Gadget
Pull up in valet, David Blaine do magic

Baby I'm on the road
But it's all good, though
I love you, love you, I'ma call right back
That boy Cas
But it's all good, all good

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
'Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking 'bout where you been at
And why you ain't pick up your phone?
I've been on the road stacking money
Talking 'bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
'Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though

When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

Okay, I be on a private jet to Portuguese to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain't never seen
The OGs keep telling me ""boy, you gon' make history""
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man, we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes, I make her panties leak
She still probably won't believe, so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it's all good though

Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

Quavo talk to 'em, ooh
You know you're shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my God what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I'm a young nigga, ain't used to relations
So you know I ain't patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don't eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That's my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches

All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry, baby, shine like the sun

I had to fly out to Vegas to show her that I'm a player
I'm not used to cuffing the women but I'm gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis, when I hit her we lay up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain't no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I didn't smash
And that taught me a lesson, lil' mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though

Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I'ma come home

Flip his body like it's fucking soft
Hole in one like we playing golf
Pass it to Takeoff I bin and I call it the toss

Dropped the top, drop the top cause she know who I am
Showed her my pinky ring, man it's bout a gram
Every time she see me, get it and she know

Now when I turn my wrist in that bowl it's spectacular
Look at my pinky, yeah it look like it's Africa
Niggas wanna be me yeah 'cause I'm a bachelor
Pull up on a nigga I'm smoking tarantula

I see you flexing, actin', you a character
Pull up caterpillar fuck your bitch today
My wrist just look like red Kool-Aid, oh my God
Pull in a Phantom and it laughs

Bitches sucking me like I'm Dracula
Young rich nigga, get your camera
Everybody wanna pull up Panarama
Quavo every time I pull up camera

Niggas wanna be the Migos
Taking a trip to go pick up them kilos
I fuck with god damn Pedro and I know John Rico

And I know Diego and I know Eduardo

Can't forget about Nino
Got out the cheeto
Wrapping the bricks and we send 'em cross the water, burrito

Pull up on the block in the Lamborghini the keys from the 

Keys from the , Keys from the 
Ooh like lingo, money long like

Look at the diamonds on our neck, VVS

Shoutout to YRN Lingo
God that my people
Might push a whole kilo
Yeah Migo Bandz, might cook a whole gram
Young Mango Foo dropped out of school
But he keep the tool
Ain't breaking no rules
All my niggas get that dough

What I do, young nigga act a fool

Act a fool, Act a fool

Hit him with the uppercut, like Ryu!

Migo Jerz, stayed around the curb
Used to hotbox in the box Chevy, that my world

Hot boxing up in the Chevy
This is his world
All of my niggas get money we dabbin', we smashin' on girls

I'm spittin' fire like a arson
Hop out the Lamb and don't park it
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
Came from the gump, no Forrest
One eye open like I'm Forest

Break in your safe house like Whitaker

Break in your safe house like Whitaker

2 million on the mansion, got a butler in it
And the nigga name is Cecil
I'm the last king on the North
So I gotta look out for my people
Mansion got a panic room in it
Dare a nigga try to break up in it
Came from the gump, I'm feeling like Forrest
Walking the trap I'm experimenting
Street kings off a bling bling
It's a brand new day and a bird gon' sing
Rich niggas on the same thang
Yung Rich Nation we just living the dream
All this gold like I'm livin' in Zulu
Welcome to my kingdom like Shaka Zulu
I don't want your hoe because she working voodoo
Spaghetti, Baguetti, don't like it but you do

I'm riding the sprinter it's bullet proof
No Forrest, but I'm in the phone booth
My diamonds shining take a peep at you
Canary yellow diamonds, Pikachu
Everyday's Halloween we pulling out costumes
And these kids love me like I'm a cartoon
The streets are like the Vietnam war
When the bitches see me they get star struck
I can't argue with no niggas, cause shit can get physical
Bullets come flipping and it was critical
I don't think I hit 'em, but I know I hit 'em cause they calling them Whitaker

We got big guns like Marvin

Migos Origin,Yung Rich Nation,2015.0,"So what part of Atlanta y'all from?
From the north side
Uh, yeah
Every show get crazy and crazy
We growing and growing every, every, every time at a show

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Quavo
We killed the Versace,
 
we went to Bahamas, shout out to the islands
Mommas and daughters they taking a picture with me and they smiling
Charlemagne said the gang Donkey of the Day (Charlamagne?)
Billboard magazine, 45K
Word on the street they say the Migos wanted
But they can't find the Migos, so they bite their recorders
When you ask for a show, can you seriously afford it
Check my schedule, itinerary loaded of course
Check my dab, it's priceless
And my niggas is righteous
I don't got no type, but I love to fuck Pisces
The chains on my neck, I might get arthritis
YRN Tha Album first album going diamond
Got my mama a Benz
Just to show her I'm grinding
Green dots in the pen but I hate the confinement
When Offset got out of jail he ate a bowl of hundreds
Dropped the Rich Nigga Timeline and we was crossed the country

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Skrrt, cook up
Graat, he shook up
I'm trapping the white, that Ku Klux
My niggas got grenades and bazookas
On the private jet we smoking up in indica
A hundred thousand, got a pick up in India
Headed to locker, we changed the millennium
Thirty thousand for a walk through minimum
Snakes in the grass start spitting out venom
That come with the territory when a nigga winning
Tinted windows on the sprinter you don't need to see this image
The blogs say I need to calm down, fuck a image
Your CEO a busta and my CEO a hustler
Choppa sound like percussion, run up on me repercussion
Came from nothing, came home with a half a million, hurt my stomach
I'm taking good care of my kids but they mamma get nothing
And if you think its wrong this ain't the right song you're bumping
Welcome to the jungle, lions, elephants and monkeys
Never see me lonely, best believe nina on me
Stuffed crust, my pocket walking with a 50 on me

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up

Pyrex pot on the stove, take that eggbeater cook up
They looking for the origin, wanna know how did we make this shit up
Came in there right and we fucking it up
Jump off the banana boat, call me King Tut
Niggas be biting our swag I tried to switch it up
But these niggas still don't get enough
Niggas with attitude don't give a fuck
Young nigga flexing never did a push up
Migo flow everybody wanna look it up
Every ten years it's on my story bro
I bet you listen up, you don't gotta like it
Yo favorite rapper he be biting
When I step in the booth, its a moment of silence
I bet yo bitch she get excited
When I'm doing show my front end and that back end be enormous
I need a double cup with my Backwood when I'm on stage performing
Can't get in my tour bus bitch, ain't tryna fuck, it's only 5 in the morning
I got some Dominican bitches that sucking and fucking and back to the origin

Disrupted the game, the industry was shook up
Three young rich niggas, never did a push up
You want the origin of the flow, you better shut the fuck up
And listen up, to what the Migos bout to cook up",https://genius.com/Migos-migos-origin-lyrics

Every time she see the jewels
She say that it scaring her like peek-a-boo
I take her, go dab in the mall
She walking out, Christian Louboutin shoes
Came from 100 bands in the trap house
To making millions on the mic now
Remember the days in the bando
Used to pull up, it look like the white house
She act just like me and she humble
She look like her mama
She can get anything from me, keep the hunnas
But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, surprise on your birthday
Got you the H3 Hummer
Now we on the phone and she on the road
She gonna go get the blue bundle
I know that she loyal, know that she loyal
Know I gotta go spoil her, gotta go spoil her

Austin Powers, baby groove
Take you to Montreal, Canada
Let you dive off in my 50 feet pool
All y'all vehicles old
Baby girl want some new
She say she want the 2014 Bentley
Baby girl, what you gon' do?
Is it me, is it me? No I think it's you
No offense to you, but I ain't spendin' my money on you
She said ""no, baby don't go""
But I ain't spent my money on a bitch since 1994

Pull up Audi like the raider

Cause I be drippin', dabbin' all on your bitches
My pockets is fat, but my pants leg is skinny
Louboutin pennies cost a pretty penny
My bitch is so bad like I Dream of Jeannie
Phantom pulling up, after that Lamborghinis
Magically takin' your bitch, Houdini
I call her my chef, order linguini
I take her, debate her, I trade her, I might hit her later
My niggas bust her open like a baker
I fucked her, I skeeted all over her naval
I call my partner, pass her to my neighbor
I do not trust her, she suckin' the plastic
I beat it, I killed it, put it in a casket
She the talk of the trenchez, they know that she nasty
Know that she ratchet and she is not classy
I'm cool on her
I'll send her right back, give me this girl
You can have your ho

Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
And I'm whipping like it's slavery, bout to cook it up

I whip it like slavery, my trap full of babies
Lil mama she hate me, she say that I'm changing
I tell her I made it, the only thing changing the money I'm making
And the pamper on these babies
I'm whipping and whipping, these pigeons and chickens
These birds they flying from city to city
I'm pouring up Actavis, dranking and sipping
The color is purple, I'm drinking on Ceely
The Bentley, the Benjis, these bitches they sucking like babies
On the nip of them titties, 
like VIC get silly
You talking bout 100 band juugs, young nigga you know that I'm with it
I pull up, I'm serving your city
I'm serving ODs, I got it from Mickey

Everywhere I go, I'mma put on a show, you know I gotta turn up
I just left the plug, got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties, got pounds, nigga tell me what you want
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot, turn it up a notch
Now I'm bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Got them chickens and them pigeons, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, got them Falcons and them Ravens, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
And I'm whipping like it's slavery, bout to cook it up

I'm cooking and whipping up pies, with no eyes
I'm cooking them burgers and fries, I'm a master in disguise
Mama she told me I'm wise, looking at Benjamin Frank in his eyes
I'm taking the plug to Hawaii, I'm chopping on bricks circumcised
My bitch, she came from Dubai,
 she got that good brain like Devry
I'm smoking and leaning and driving, I hope I don't get DUI
Watch out for the snake and the lies
I'm trapping and whipping cream pies
My wrists is like water come dive, the streets is a jungle you gotta survive

Everywhere I go, I'mma put on a show, you know I gotta turn up
I just left the plug, got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties, got pounds, nigga tell me what you want
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot, turn it up a notch
Now I'm bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Got them chickens and them pigeons, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, got them Falcons and them Ravens, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up

Sipping Actavis, that mud on me, now bitch, how you feel
Overseas flow, take your ho over the water
She ain't never seen a nigga say ""bonjour""
I got left wrist and it looks like it's a clock
Oh my god! That's a Rolly wet, it's flooded with these rocks
I was selling rocks, started on the block
Now I'm overseas, I get a 50 for a walk

I got lots of money, I got lots of money
Came a long way from kicking doors and grippin' that Tommy
You might think you're funny, I was pushing onions
Looking for nothing, and now I'm fucking something
They thought I wouldn't make it, bad bitches hating
Fuck niggas hating, they contemplating
On a nigga plane, sleeping like they xans
Every time you see young Quavo, I'm having bands
Shout-out to my big brother Bandz in the Lamb
Going real crazy, doing donuts like the m...

When I growed up I wanted to be a king

Wanted to be the king, look at my pinky ring
Look at your bitch in the kitchen, whippin' and whippin' that thing
I don't pay her nothing, won't give her a single dollar
After she cook up the chicken, she gon' come and swallow

Takeoff kick that bitch up out the house, that bitch gotta Takeoff

Free my nigga Bobby Bitch
Hoes in the lobby, bitch
Ooh, diamonds look like coffee, bitch

Dreams in the 'Rari, bitch

Lame ass square, looking at my diamonds on my wrist, it's chandelier
We hang out with boss niggas, don't hang out with queers
We gon' make them terrified, we might cut off his ear
Might cut off his neck, we don't give a fuck
We doing anything for checks, bet
Fuck with the Tec
These niggas they acting like they really sipping on Actavis, but they sippin' Hi-Tec

Rich nigga shit we ain't worried about a bitch

Remember last time we finessed that fuckin migo

Finessed that flamingo yeah we finessed that flamingo
Howard D. was loyal about 50 thousand

Pullin' up  on any scene with that chopper and that fucking Beam

Hold up niggas do not talk to me

Snakes in that grass, they gon' get you on trouble
If I get jammed, put that on my mama
That I won't tell on my brother
In the bando and I'm countin' the fuck out the p's
Got rich off a pot and some water

Got hundreds of bands, they comin' in, on Tonka trucks (Tonka trucks)
Fuck nigga, he don't believe me, he could go add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up
The bricks just came in (came in), the molly came in (came in)
The white just came in, you don't believe it, fuck nigga, add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up
Add it up, add it up, add it up",https://genius.com/Migos-add-it-up-lyrics
Stay,UnKnown,UnKnown,"When the plane come down in your town
And we only in town for three days
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
She say I always got somewhere to stay, stay, stay
Always got somewhere to stay
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
That's why everywhere I go I always save a plane

I told you once I ain't gon tell you twice
Better back off my bitch young nigga or you might lose your life
Just me and her ridin round in my two-seater
We made plenty millions that was the first time I showed her the egg beater
Remember the time the police they lock me up and you buying me out
Remember that time they wanted you to talk and you close your mouth
That's why I fuck with you, I really can’t say I love you
But I do really fuck with you, like everything that you do and she know

When the plane come down in your town
And we only in town for three days
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
She say I always got somewhere to stay, stay, stay
Always got somewhere to stay
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
That's why everywhere I go I always save a plane

Rap game that's Birmingham, Alabama, Savannah, Atlanta
Any city any place
No matter where I go in the world
I got a chick to keep a nigga straight
When I call lil mama she come through
Sacks full of cash we run through
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Where ever the fuck we want to
I enjoy all the time that we spend, but it never seems to last
Now I gotta get back to the cash

When the plane come down in your town
And we only in town for three days
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
She say I always got somewhere to stay, stay, stay
Always got somewhere to stay
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
That's why everywhere I go I always save a plane

No matter how far I go, lil mama she coming to get me
She do what she gotta do, she independent
I trust her, but I can’t love her
She know why young nigga a hustler
Got a young nigga's back when I’m trouble
Got the body of a goddess, Brazilian mixed with Scottish
She exotic, she come from a island
I can trust her in the trap, she ain’t gon steal my dope
If the feds kick the door I know lil mama won’t fold

When the plane come down in your town
And we only in town for three days
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
She say I always got somewhere to stay, stay, stay
Always got somewhere to stay
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
That's why everywhere I go I always save a plane",https://genius.com/Migos-stay-lyrics

Struggle,Rich Nigga Timeline,2014.0,"Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

Got to survive, the struggle
I had to get my money cause I ain’t have no muscle
My squad gon ride that’s because I trust em
If he want to die, know my squad gon bust him
If they ain’t with us then my nigga fuck em
It’s a struggle in my hood, blue Benjamins, I touch em
RIP to Mike Brown
, I heard my nigga fuck with us
Middle finger to the police dare them niggas fuck with us (Fuck 12!)
I got all these chains, I’m representing slavery
Only listen to my god and mama, that’s who made me
When my brother  called my phone, that shit was crazy
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Mama told me that she can’t visit me in the pen
She want to break me out and I can’t see her going in
I swear to god you might ain't seen it
But if you been through the struggle I know you feel this

Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

See the struggle is a motherfucker
Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain’t gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain’t got to tuck em
Swear to god if you touch my brother I ain’t gon hesitate to bust ya
Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It’ll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Remember plugging up that George Foreman
Early in the morning eat leftovers
I had to warm it, now a young nigga eat steak and shrimp at Benihanas
I remember ten piece chicken nuggets from McDonalds
I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
I came a long way from renting the Audi, now I own it
Rest in peace Ree-Ree and Pistol Pete, the top is lonely

Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle

First free my brother, we used to build the mansions in the house with covers
He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can’t beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn’t going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed
Givenchy my toe, I came out that bowl, I lived on the stove

Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle

Call it the struggle

Rich Nigga Timeline,Rich Nigga Timeline,2014.0,"First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time I turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine

Free my nigga Westside, locked up to this day
R.I.P. my migo P, my nigga dead in the grave
And I dare a fuck nigga come and try me today
Abracadabra his face
Quavo the magician, the pack gone it's missin'
I got a ho and she got a ho and now they both kissin'
Do you remember, the life I was livin'?
I'm callin' the plug, I'm juugin' up pounds, I'm breakin' down midget
I got the birds, pigeons
They know who the fuck run the city (Nawfside!)
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, ""Quavo don't spend all your Benjis"" (mama)
Told mama, ""I'm sorry, pockets on infinity"" (infinity)
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown
'Til I took your bitch, drop her off right there by Morris Brown
Used to cook up bricks 'til I turned that shit to an extra now
I got the magic stick, feelin' like Criss Angel, bitch
I disappear bricks

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old

Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine

17 stackin' and countin', 18 I ran from the bounty
You niggas is softer than Bounty, my nigga got 15, free Ronny
Check out my bio, plenty felonies, known for countin' up broccoli
Known for stackin' up celery, you niggas ain't even a vet to me
'Member the days? Run in your house like a raid
Young nigga tryna get paid
Pistol to his face, give him a shave
Never selfish, all the money I gave
Never change, all the money I make
1 baby, all these bitches I laid
2 guns, nigga, never afraid
Migos the army I'm never gon' trade
Set-Set hit a 20 band juug
He helped the hood, everybody was good
I'm white like a tiger and I got the wood
My niggas on go like Nike, they gon' do it
These niggas wonderin', like how did we do it?
Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid
I'm from the Zone 3 if you niggas ain't knew it
I'm throwin' up the north cause that is my hood
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
KK got my back, ain't no doubt
Player made, free my bro, let him out
This shit is crazy, shout out mama house
Don't come to my trap and you unannounced
21 Challenger mounted up
Doin' phones, fucked your credit up
When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home
19, I was on my own
My grandma died, cancer on her bones
I ran in houses just to buy some Foams
You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old

13 I got my first halftime
14, broke in the club for an Alpine
15 I got my first Glock 9
It was rusty but it still'd bust a nigga
I was lil' nephew, they wasn't gon' touch a nigga
If I did, my uncles'll bust a nigga
Migo gang, they couldn't fuck with a nigga
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
It's was y'all side versus Nawfside
Knocked a couple niggas out a couple times
Got in shootouts with niggas a hundred times
Come to your party, we fuckin' it up
Young niggas, we never gave a fuck
Young niggas, 10, 12, 13, on go with a finger point
A lot of squads start poppin' up
Screamin' shit that we ain't heard of
Migos pull up at your residence
Here comes the issue, ""it wasn't us, bruh""
We know you flexin', got the information
So you still gon' get hit with the uppercut
Beat a nigga to a puddle, nigga snitchin'
Now we runnin' from the task force
Niggas was kickin' in doors, takin' flat screens and all the gold
Never got it and I sat on it, nigga, everything I got was sold
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops
Knock in your door, take your lil' brother's Xbox
Migo Jerz stand around the curb
Used to match up in the hotbox
Hit a juug for some True Religions
And some Robin Denims in a public community
My brother's keepers, Migo we got unity
Bout to fire up at the park right on Harrington
To the bando, you see niggas gamblin'
Hit a kick door my niggas be ramblin'
I got a bag on my back like I'm Santa Claus
Finnesse a nigga, Papa John's up in Panama

First kicked the door when I was 17 years old

Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old

Plan B,YRN 2 (Young Rich Niggas 2),2016.0,"I gave a bitch a Plan B (Open your mouth)
‘Cause she was my plan B (Side bitch)
I got my hoe on a leash (Get over here)
She a real trapper in the streets
My niggas don’t mean no harm, unless you come handling me (My niggas don’t mean it)
Cookie bag and a Percocet, that’s what applied to me (I’m geeking)
The dab is not a sneeze (Dab)
I fuck her once, then she leave (Smash)
She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

Eat it up - busy bees
Stevie Wonder, play with keys
I told my plug, “Yadda mean,”
That mean, “Come on, with them things,”
I put the work ‘cross seas
Feel like I play with Kareem
I walk around with the nin’
Hundred thousand for the team
I woke up ‘cause I had a dream
I shot at nigga in the spleen
Two niggas looking like Kel and Ken’
Your favorite cousin, dope fiends
I was going on a mission
But I swapped out my hoe for that
Young nigga talking business
Tell that nigga I ain’t here for that
Migo Gang like the Thundercats
And I’m trapping out a Hellcat
Pussy nigga, you a lab rat
Bitch, my diamonds doing jumping jacks
Pull up, gave a Phantom heart attack
Hoe nigga, where your heart is at?
We quick to send ‘em to the cardiac
Cookies and Perc’ – that’s the starter pack
Go to the jeweler; want all of that
Ball on my court, nigga, can’t get the ball back
I be where the money fall at
I take the pot and beat it with a ball bat
You ain’t own it boy, you rented that
If it ain’t broke I ain’t fixing that
I put the dope in the trunk
I put the extras in the kitty-cat

She only got her fucking keys; I give her phone down the street

Fuck on me, then fuck my brother
Just because she’s your bitch, you don’t trust her
These bitches really trying to come up
Damn, she trapped you, you nutted up
When you went to work, I had picked her up
She said she want to kick it on the bus
Fucking and sucking up all of us
You know how we do; we just slaughtered her
My jeweler made me look like Slick the Ruler
My bitches bougie, walking with a poodle
When I was little, thought bitches had cooties
Now that I’m grown, got a brick in her coochie
Finesse the plug; I hit him with the whoop-de-whoo
Finessed him right out his shoe
I got some boot in my Margiela boots
Bitches running ‘round my mansion in nude
Bitches stick to me like Gorilla Glue
Smoking on cookies did somebody poo?
You niggas is suckers; you a roody-poo
YRN 2, ball alert, got the news
Sipping on Actavis, like it’s a brew
(Aye, Boaw!) Who shot at you?
Yes we can fuck, is your friend fucking too?
(Ooh, Boaw!) I’m killing her too
Plan B, you can fuck her for free
Make sure that shit don’t get back to wifey
Skeet on her cheek, fuck her one time a week
Get a Plan B, ‘cause I know I was geeked
Fucking this bitch, went to sleep
I got to get this bitch a Plan B
She fucking that nigga, that nigga, then me
I just want that mouth, ‘cause I know it’s on fleek!

I bought her Céline, she ain’t want it
She rather go get her some chonies
She don’t fuck with no bitches that’s phony
She rather walk around lonely
She telling her best friend, how I just piped her down
Now her and her best friend, we having a threesome now
She was with me when I had all these pounds
She was with me when I kicked all these doors

Lately lot of you niggas been rockin' rhinestones
Talkin' 'bout you on the block, Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Takin' a trip to go pick up that pack and we pull up in Bentleys
Walkin' around with that sack, no 6, nigga walking with a 50
It's Migo gang, QC the label, fuck niggas better get with it
After my show, I'm on top of your ho, nigga autographin' bitches titties
Travelin' around the globe, I was told not to sell my soul
For the price of fame and never fold
Act tough behind the internet
A nigga takin' chains, Debo

Tried to fuck lil mama, I don't really like no foreplay
Talkin' all that shit, I'll put a price all on your toupee
I hit him in the mouth, he thought he had a damn toothache
Most of you niggas are too fake
They watchin' a nigga like Blu-Ray
You talkin' 'bout that blow, but you can't be from in the kitchen
Whippin' up Alicia Keys
You say that you got the big money
But really your money is sesame seeds
I got this bitch named Valerie, she bring me bricks from Sicily
My neck is flooded and my double cup is mudded
The streets made me a villain, out that bowl, I made a million

Trap Dab Freestyle,Designer Drugz,2014.0,"The work, it do magic like Criss Angel
I'm selling more chickens than Bojangles
We shoot the chopper from your head to your ankle
So many chains on my neck, they get tangled
I'm in Atlanta, sipping Texas Ranger
Too Atlanta 'cause my goons, you can't tame them
My niggas banging GD, twist your fingers
Mystikal .45, that bitch come with danger
So many bitches, they calling me gigolo
Got a fox on my back, not talking Vivica
All of these niggas, they mimicking
Most of the money got energy, whipping up chemicals
Swag is not usual
Devil on my back, fuck Lucifer
I'm trapping, capping all these cubicles
Never made honor roll
I'm at the top and you fell off like dominoes

I lost my feelings for women
When I learned how it feel to thumb through the Benjamins
Due to the fact that my Rolex a fifty
Arm & Hammer like I'm John Henry
Professor Klump pockets, I'm a chemist
Racks on me like I'm playing tennis
A hundred thousand on my new Bentley
Another hundred thousand on my Breitling bezel
Gold like I’m Shabba on African, diamonds
Canary yellow like the sunset, shining
I'm selling 16's, ain't talking 'bout rhyming
I'm looking for droughts to change the climates
No comprendo, they come away and bought pesos
Got the clay and serve the folks, call it Clay-Doh
I think I heard my front door
Go get the scope, hundred bricks for Diego

Speaking of the yayo, Young Guapo, Young Guapo, he all about pesos
Switcharoo on your main bitch, me and my nigga, hell nah, we won't date hoes
You speaking about Christian Louboutin? Well, we get them in by the caseload
I'm a boss like Rozay, Young Guapo got niggas on the payroll
We used to it, not new to it, just stacking up the paper
Went from standing on the block to smoking OG in skyscrapers (top floor condo)
My niggas got beams, no lasers
Cavalli my jeans, ten chains on with a Versace blazer
Longway, bitch

Longway reloaded, blood on my blue Benjamin like a Crip runner, trap will blow his out
Balenci' Givenchy, I trap and dab
Five naked bitches give me bubble bath
Longway Nino Brown
Put my foot in the cage just to break a pound
I'm fiending for it, they want brown sugar
She sneaking and geeking on Sugar Hill
Bitches suck my dick, trying to get it shooting
Longway put the bitch out with the roof
Pablo my plug and the mistress blew me
Call the little bitch Susie Choosy
At the Chevron, rolling up a doobie
Taking pictures, this ain't no camera, you're a movie
Longway Bond, you too groovy
Longway Bond, boy, you groovy?
And my backwood stuffed crushed fruity
And I don't wanna fuck the bitch if she ain't cute
The bitch gon' juug me a Cuban
And my Rolex blue
Strawberry, vanilla, chocolate three scoops
My diamonds confused her
She think she on roofies
Diamonds from Africa, shout out from Frank Lucas
Fresh out the banana boat with my hooligans
We come for the dope and we come from Sinise
I make the white boy jump, my wrist a chemist
Now they bow down to me like I’m the minister
Chopping bricks at the penitentiary
Damn, a young nigga tripping
Over a hundred of them fucking with some bitches
Hold it down, these niggas snitching
I'm the reason why y'all niggas cripping
Young nigga do it for the hood
Chopper with a wood grain handle
Young nigga Bangkok, call me Hancock
The chopper still got you shaking dreadlocks
With your bitch in the film for the bedrock
Pussy ass nigga caught a case, said it's deadlocked
Turned around, shot him with the same Glock

So you say you shot him with the same Glock
Young nigga feeling like 2Pac
Still will hit a nigga with the rerock
Worth about a Bentley and I'm riding in a tee-top
They go in a frantic, but don't panic
They calling me Quavo, the stick-them-up bandit
He wanted the chopper, I let them have it
We hop on the PJ, touchdown on Atlantic
Tried to hit the Sprinter, now it's bulletproof
Try to fuck a Migo, bet a nigga shoot
Deuce deuce, pocket rocket in the VIP booth
Now you wanna ask me what you do
Water diamonds like a swimming pool
Had to spend two thousand for Margiela shoes
Young Quavo whipping up the chemicals
Hell nah, nigga never finished school
SRT Audi, I'm dabbing and I got your bitch that wanna leave her junkies in it
Mama, she told me, ""Go get the bitch"", I put my wrist in the water, it started swimming
On the north side, we were really getting it, then I'm stepping and spinning it, Longway in it
We was roadrunning, fucking up the city, Migos, Pablo, Guapo, PeeWee independent",https://genius.com/Migos-trap-dab-freestyle-lyrics

Bow, bow, gruow, gruow

Young rich nigga tryna see a milli
I got niggas that'll get you for a meal ticket
I know niggas that remix, re-rock the whole chicken
I feel like the president, Richard Nixon

Gruow, gruow, gruow we got body parts
I don't need no body guard, I just use my face card
In the kitchen frying fishes, got to come with tartar sauce
Call me Pastor Takeoff, healing niggas Peter Popoff
I'm A1 nigga no steak sauce
Baking the birdies, I'm having a bake-off
Extorting these niggas and money they pay off
These niggas got work but ain't working they laid off
I hide body parts like I'm Jeffrey Dahmer
A living legend, Ronald McDonald
My wrist terminator, but I am no Arnold
Football Xans, I call 'em Hey Arnold

Yo' bitch wanna fuck the squad
Cause she see exotic cars
Them niggas hating on your boy
Bow, bow, gruow, gruow
We got body parts
Young rich nigga tryna see a milli
I got niggas that'll get you for a meal ticket
I know niggas that remix, re-rock the whole chicken
I feel like the president, Richard Nixon

Fuck nigga talking hit 'em with extensions
Throw 'em in the river now the nigga missing
Fuck nigga tripping, not payin' attention
I hit 'em with semis he don't even see it
If I catch a body I'm gonna be innocent
Clear the whole scene and I'm leaving no witnesses
Everybody get it, even civilians
The only people that I spare is the children
Dissecting you niggas, take away your body parts
Karate chop that nigga like it's martial-arts
Shot that nigga, left 'em at the park
Put the pussy nigga on a milk carton
My choppa banana-clipped, got a knife
Don't roll the dice nigga, you risk your life
I'm pouring up lean on your grave-site
I throw him the bullet, he catch it like Jerry Rice

Ugh, fuck a bitch cause it's Thug Life
Smoking good cause my plug right
200k sold on my debut release
200 felons locked up from the team
Popping 200 bottles the day they release
Yes, I am deceased, meaning I'm raiding from all of these sheets
Get Rich or Die Tryin' keep that on repeat
And all these bitches is trying to get on me
And I fuck all of them hoes, got 2 cell phones, can't none of them call me",https://genius.com/Migos-body-parts-lyrics

He need a half a bag, remixin' wit' half a swag
Don't hit my phone, won't talk to you, no need to call me back
Whip game, hurricane, feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Ice chain from Johnny Dang,
 diamonds kickin' like Liu Kang
Naked bitches in the kitchen sniffin' off of dishes
Got them Thanksgiving turkeys, Quavo sellin' whole chickens
Servin' patients like a clinic, runnin' bands up at Lenox
Quavo President Clinton, selling Monica Lewinsky
I might pull up on you wit' the birds in that 'Rari engine
When them plays come my way, I might catch it like a mitten

Gold chains, bought my index a Versace ring
So much coke in my trap spot, the pot's hot
Money jumpin' out my shoe box like Jack Box
Bitches whippin' in the kitchen, bra and panties off
Never think 'bout juugin' cause they know I cut they fingers off
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells
Flats in my panorama, watch me change the channels
All these damn babies, use saran for the pampers
Change my name to Tetris cause I got so many blocks
In the trunk I got two blocks I might just pull up on yo' block

I just bought a Bentley wit' my wrist game

Yo' closet filled wit' Old Navy, my closet filled wit' old babies
I'm whippin', I'm whippin' them pots in the kitchen, you know I be gettin' I'm flippin' them benjis
Run wit' the pack then I'm cuttin' yo' throat, before I buy coke, I gotta get quote
Breads by the loads, bring 'em on boats, I fly overseas I'm doin' the most
No lie, I will take a oath, finesse the plug, it's time for a toast
I started wit' 'bows and started wit' grams and now I'm sellin' them wholes
I feel like John Gotti, them bricks in my Masi
Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
The feds keep talkin', they say I'm a target
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
You know I got bucks but not from Milwaukee
It's never a drought, it's bricks on the market

Straight out the motherfuckin tombs, man Ah ah ah
Free all my real niggas, ya heard, SHMIGO!

Shmigo!
Free my nigga bobby man
Free my nigga rowdy man
Huh, Shmigo Gang
Dabbing in Maison Margiela
Get popped like a kettle, Hit you in your cerebellum
I'm seeing stars in my panamera
We went through the pain, but we never let up
Yellow corvette mustard, lambo red ketchup
Millions that, nigga I'm a walking vegetable
These niggas be biting and I'm getting fed up
Got your bitch at my condo with both of her legs up
These niggas be talking behind computers with a gun emoji
Now he think he a shooter
Eating Benihana, take a trip to Punta Cana
Fuck it, I might land in Bermuda
Thirty thirty, I got thirty rounds
The shotty make a nigga lose pounds
Harriet Tubman, money underground
You niggas is sick and we got the crown
Diamonds and pearls for my girl
It's a man's world, I feel like James Brown
Smoking power at the Trump tower
Nigga gassing, laughing, watching Richard Pryor
Fuck a job I don't get paid by the hour
Can't be from the block, I heard you a coward
When you got money it come with the power
I am the supplier, grip money like pliers
Stay with my Glock 40 its extended
Can't wait to pull it, trigger finger itching
Fork in the pot, lets go fishing
My momma always told me don't be trusting bitches
Hit em with it, hit em with it, hit em with it
Look at these diamonds like Sonny Liston
Migos fighting in the crowd
Looking like Ron Artest versus the Pistons

Quavo!
Free my nigga Bobby Bitch
Hoes in the lobby bitch
At the age of 17, I hit my first lick
Twelve coming hit the fence you better jump the ditch
You don't wanna get caught with the dirty stick
Told that bitch to suck my dick, I don't want no kiss
When I got my first M, I bust down my wrist
When I got my first sem, I emptied the clip
Bad bitch fuck with a bad boy call her Lil Kim
Hakeem Olajuwon, above the rim
When I go to DC (Pow) I thought it was him
Then I land in Bahamas, order up some shrimp
The plug wanna meet up in Bahamas, told him make it quick
The money keep calling, tell it come in

Migo! QC!
Barkley, Barkley (Wow!)
Yo, yo

Feds hit the spot they ain't find no work cause the bricks right under me
""Fheww!"" Sell a brick so fast : Float like a butterfly, sting like Ali
Charles Barkley, 34oz got the broccoli
Charles Barkley, 34oz got the broccoli

Yo, Quavo
I got the broccoli
Trappin' and cappin' the top of the double tree
You better make way in the industry
Young nigga, I come to bless the economy
Remember my teachers, they say I wouldn't make it
I wonder if they ever think of me ... (Bow! Bow!)
I don't give a fuck feeling like Pac on my enemies
Your bitch she say that she loving a boss I tell her get lost (Adios)
We flex in 'sace, Versace, Givenchy, don't care what they cost (Givenchy?)
My niggas still trapping out bandos they come from the north
Now a nigga want to take a picture
Wanna flex with a nigga cause I'm worth 6 figures


You niggas done heard of me
Came from the poverty, family unity, Georgia community
Fucked up situation, underestimated
Now we in Bentley's and Rovers in Beverley
Look in the mirror, young rich nigga
Raised by my mama and my grandma nigga
No father figure, I'm a street nigga
Call me the god-father fuck nigga
I knew what it took to be bossed up, had a whole lot to offer
Sacrifice, I took some losses
Snakes in the grass be cautious
Rich forever, never going broke
I don't give a fuck if I got to go to selling dope
I got the bags, grocery store
Selling them O's, flipping them bowls


Remember when I was a kid, mama told me eat my broccoli
(Eat that damn broccoli !)
Remember me I'm at the bus stop flexing my brand new pair of Barkley's
Different day, different year, different swag
I gave up the Barkley's for you wannabes
Cause you fuck niggas are under me
High-top or Low top, Giuseppe me
Charles Barkley, 34, I got the currency
Flowing like poetry
Cook it like poultry
Migos QC with the new OKC
My trap full of kids like an elementary
Selling that Hannah Montana and Kimberly
I trap but I keep it a mystery
Cause if they knew the Police'll be after me",https://genius.com/Migos-charles-barkley-lyrics
MuhFuckn Tired,YRN 2 (Young Rich Niggas 2),2016.0,"Yeah, young rich niggas
Back to back, two times
Hahaha
30, you a fool for this one

Hit a nigga with the throwaway
Bitch I came from another place
Unfortunately we couldn't beat the case
Fuck it we outta jail anyway
You want the Migo gang? You got to pay
Kickin' in doors for the 10k, 14k, anything
Young nigga cashin' out for the change
I already dreamed that I had the fame
Red and white coupe like a candy cane
Pop a perc, it feel like Bruce Wayne
Chop a brick like I'm Tsung Shang
Bitch I'm dabbin' in my own lane
Chokeslam a nigga, Quavo Kane
I hate a nigga tryna cook plain
Cause my money taller than a great dane
We gave the world dab fever check
My receipt is thousand dollar sneakers
Stop and get a play from cheetah
Quavo Derek Jeter, keep a street sweeper
I'm a salt water alligator eater
I play with water, you can check the meter
Cookie bag, that's my choice of reefer
Migo gang, aka grim reapers

Try the squad, nigga shots fired
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
Hit 'em if he cross the gun line
You holdin' yours? I'ma bust mine
He lookin' wrong, call it sus time
Free my niggas, give 'em phone time
Skin a nigga like a pork rind
We get to the money in short time
Watch us make it back 10 times
My wrist spinnin', I'm so fuckin' tired
That my favorite line, I'm motherfuckin' tired
Chop a brick like a samurai
We the niggas make the birds fly
Then I fucked the bitch five times
Then I took her out cause I'm fuckin' tired

Takeoff!!
Just fucked a model bitch five times
I just ate a burger from Five Guys
I'm smokin' on cookies from High Times
You smokin' but don’t roll them outside
Migo gang, we have them mob ties
Put a fuck nigga on Fox 5
Pretty little bitch with her mouth wide
She see me pull up in that, frog eyes
Yeah bitch, it’s 30 on the beat (30 Roc)
Keep a 30 by my side
My bitches on fleek, Louboutin they feet
Ain't no question my niggas gon' ride
Ain't talkin' bout Drexler
When they come to that dope, nigga, I bet it's gon' glide
Ain't talkin' bout Dexter
Cook in the laboratory,
 Fendi frames on my eyes
Remember my pockets win the lottery
So every check gotta pay my tithes
Nigga tellin' lies just to cut time
My nigga you see 'em televised
No matter how hard I try
When I put music out I'm still gon' get criticized
Nigga fuckin' round with squad
Think they wanna get decapitized

Then I took her out cause I'm fuckin' tired

I'm tired.... I'm tired
These niggas flexin'
They talk about diamonds, they do not got VS inside 'em
I hit a lick, we divided it
Porsche with the gator inside of it
I'm on three Percs and I'm out of it
She gonna suck me up privately
I was young when the trap game adopted me
Grabbed the stick and shot his abdomen
Young nigga I am an arson
I got the pump in the cut with the carbon
My wrist cost a motherfuckin' 'Rari
I am a boss, I pull strings like a guitarist
You out of season, you need Lawries
Pull up in Beamers but trap out a Taurus
Look at the brick on my wrist look like Mick
When I got famous I darkened my tint
She took a mile when I gave her an inch
Won't sell my soul for some cash or a Bent
Hop in the plane and we land in Berlin
Christian Dior my bitch and her friend
(?) when I was in the pen
Prayin' to God that I don't go again

Quavo wanna see you pop it nasty
Lil mama so thick, look like Kim Kardashian
But no I'm not wifing, young nigga passin'
She making Impala at the 4th of July
She know I got millions, no need to lie
Tattoo on her booty is a butterfly
I bet when she make it pop, it's gonna fly
Soda pop booty, she poppin' her booty like popcorn, and it's wobblin'
Wanna take her home, when I get in my room, when I get the pussy, I'mma dive in it
She make me wanna have a million babies, when she poppin' the booty, hop-scotchin' it
I reach in my pocket, I slap her on the ass, told her she better not stop poppin' it
Everybody know that she a cutie
You keep spendin' money, she make you foolish
But look at me, Young Quavo, I'mma do it
She poppin' it on me, she make me lose it
I run out of cash, hit the ATM
I'm livin' my life like the game of Sims
She stomp the booty on me like a pair of Timbs

Freaky deaky, pussy drippin', leakin'
White girls, I got jungle fever
Her booty jumpin', every beat out the speaker
Hit her one time, then I leave with the leader
Run around, jump up and down like a pogo
IPhone my camera, we might make a porno
I had to pipe her up, my game for a makeover
Private jet to LA, we don't do layovers
Ooo, Oh, piercings in the nipples, piercings in the dimples, pop it like a pimple
She nasty, bet you didn't know her daddy a pastor, laughter
She in my trap while she poppin' the castle
Speed it up, then she go slow
Grippin' that pussy, do the tootsie roll
She go harder than the concrete
Italian tailor, Givenchy
Money longer than a bungy
All this damn gold like a treasury
Lick on me like I am licorice
Burkin bag, she's a expensive bitch
She ratchet, she still got the kinky twist
Pop it, pop it, in my Bentley bitch

The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies (babies)
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies
The way she shake that ass, she make me wanna make a million babies

Ball, ball, ball, ball pop that booty
Pop it

The way that she suckin' it, I might be taking it
Breaking it but no relationship
Bigger booty, no big booty Judy
Her pussy wet when she get on that percocet
She looked at my hand, saw it full of bands
Put a little bit, bitch pop that
I'm throwin' cash, cash, all niggas see is ass
It must be an ass attack
Do you want some of these old hundreds baby?
I'm talkin' older than Thundercats
She shakin', she know her ass fat
Got me thinkin' where is her momma at
All the bitches starin' at you in the club
'Cause they know that you be poppin' that
She breakin' it, makin' the club shake
She done gave the old man a heart attack
She shakin' like Shakira, look in the mirror
No ass shots, her booty real
She poppin' her nigga no Activis seal
Bad bitches tell me how you feel
All my rich niggas stand in the mirror
Mirror, mirror, it's a million here
Migo chain lookin' like chandeliers
Shakin' that ass like it's fast and furious

Pretty lady, she got her own in her Mercedes
And she single, she thick and grown with no babies
I really wanna take little mama home and go crazy
But she won't let me, I can't do nothing but respect it
She go to work from Monday through Thursday she earned it
She don't care about my money, I sip my tea like Kermit
She don't care bout them hunnids she pull 'em out the purses
Lil bitch I'm the dab king I fuck her like a virgin
She say she got a 9-5 I know that bitch serving
It's none of my business I ain't worry
But if you got a nigga and you workin' for him
I'ma shoot that nigga, Quavo Stephen Curry

Gotta tell the truth shawty be dabbin'
Pull up on you in the jagger with Aston
Her stomach so flat like she fastin'
Look at that ass it's fantastic
Go get that money lil bitty bitch (go get it)
Now hop on that pole and get nasty
She won't let you smash unless you spendin' it
It gotta be some type of benefit
Well fuck it I don't really need that bitch
She a bad bitch, she ain't really shit
I beat it, I hit her but I can not keep her
We at the condo she smokin' the reefer
Some of you lie she a beater
Nasty and know little mama in the fetal
Balenciega, alligator sneakers

Pulling Benjamin's out her wallet
Looking real exotic, walking in Zanotti (Damn!)
Big booty so big it's shaped, look like an apple (Ooh!)
She bending over bouta make me get tackled
Wanna go to  let her see the castle
Grab 'bout 28 folds you gon' need a ladder (Ooh!)
We smoking up cookies burning like a candle (Gas!)
Asked her where she's from she told me Seattle
Mama live in California, said her brother doing 5 years in Savannah
Got a condo down in Alabama
She gon' let me pull up be my nasty dancer (Beat it!)
TV's in my phantom can change the channels (Flex)
Lookin' up to the sky cause its panoramic
I fuck with her pimpin' cause she really getting it (fuck with ya)
No Felicia, lil mama run up a ticket (Add it up)
Dabbin might pull up on you in Givenchy (Damn!)
Pretty lil lady, know she independent
You beat the statistics you got you a car and a house
So I can't take you out of the trenches, (Nah!)
Ain't gotta add me for none of my benji's
You 'bout ya riches and you mind your business
Takeoff!

Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady and she got her own
Pretty lil lady you know she got her own",https://genius.com/Migos-pretty-little-lady-lyrics

Reminiscing in my mansion
Thinking back then in the bando I put the dope in her panties
Remember back then on the nawf side
Fifty bands in the suitcase
Free my big brother Kobe
That's the only nigga that threw me the 10k
We were so hot we could sizzle
Now I'm so cold like a blizzard
You think my life was a riddle
Till I send my niggas go and get them
I do this shit for my dawgs
We used to kick doors and all
Now we fuck hoes and ball
Now we fuck hoes and ball
You don't understand it
I took all these chances
That's why I move all my niggas to my fucking mansion
We came up from nothing, jugg a cutie, smoke a onion
We came a long way from the bando smelling like funyuns

Eat out your gut then we turn you to ashes

Spend fifty thou' on my watch, it ain't cheap
You couldn't walk a mile in my motherfucking feet
Wanna get out so I took the damn plea
I took a chance
You told on your man
Got a bitch up in France
Call my phone when she land
She in love with my cash
Treat that bitch like a nat
Send my shooters attack
I can't never go back
Act a fool with the gat

Remember when I wasn't havin'
Like I got it, I call that shit below average
Now I make a movie Great Gatsby
Remember they didn’t want to call me Takeoff
Like instead of Ali they say Cassius
Now look at them, got 'em embarrassed
Chances, only got one shot, gotta get to the top
And niggas can’t stand it
These bitches gone still drop they panties
All the advances when you get chances

Smell like a pound while on campus
They hated us so they banned us

Trap Problems,Back to the Bando,2015.0,"We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems

No, no, no, no

The way that I whip it, no Chef Boyardee, they wanna know the recipe
I pop a pint, and I pop me a eight, now I'm movin' slower than a centipede
Twenty bitches runnin' round the lobby, suckin', fuckin' just to say they did it
I done fucked so many bitches, saw many ass and titties, it's ridiculous
Get on my knees and I pray at night, forgive me for my sins know I do the wrong and rights
Situation feel right when I'm wrong, but a nigga feel wrong when I'm right
Gianni Versace cover my eyesight
Kid Cudi nigga trappin' day and night
I be in the water with the sharks and they bite
These real diamonds nigga, Rihanna, cut off the lights

All my niggas from the slums, only girl I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers

I'm the one they talkin' bout with 
the spot with the pots in there (Pots in there, pots in there)
Walkin' round the city with a nine in my pants and a knot in ‘em (Knot in 'em, knot in 'em)
Yo bitch she suckin' on me and she tryna get all of my (All of my Benjamins!)
Switcharoo your bitch, we flippin' that ho like a spatula
For real my nigga don't run up on me cause you niggas don't know me
Niggas that know me don't show me cause they know I got it on me
Feel like The Rock I'm giving out people elbows to all you Jabronis
You talkin' hundreds, 
we say chonies
Your niggas loaners my owners
Macaroni cottage cheese, 20 bandz in my Balmain jeans
No limit Master P, bout it bout it on the scene
When I take a piss, I see codeine
Hotboxin' backwoods in the lambo, can't breathe
If I smoke then it's expensive weed, 
I give you the sack if you find the seed

All my niggas from the slums, only girl that I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers
Came up from the bottom, now a nigga having power
Used to trap and slang powder, new Rolly ice on my hours
I got the bird like a owl, I'm in New York smokin' on sour

Look at you niggas is cowards, the bricks is surrounded like flower
I got her sangin' just like Mya, suckin' and fuckin' until she get tired
Feeling like Donald Trump, bitch you is fired
All my niggas blowing up like a fuckin' tire
Late nights in the bando feel like The Wire
My niggas heard that you snitchin, where is your wire?
And it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer
Said it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer!

We earn stripes on the Nawfside
Just another day, just another day
Just another day on the North
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the Nawfside, it's just another day on the Nawfside
On the North, it's just another day on the Nawfside

It's just another day, what is a day on the north?
Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
I run the game
Look at my house, take a look at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day
I play the game like a game of spades
And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k


Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AK came equipped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the Nawfside rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyez on me (2Pac)
My young nigga hit a 100 band jugg in the club it was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Gwinnett County patrolling


Trapping on Club Drive,
 Migos the Army got Mob ties
We hit the ground, we had to do time
Kick in the door a million times
My nigga Westside he had to do five
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no burglar bars
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
I got a bulldog and it's gonna bark
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart
Needed college, I didn't go to Clark

I put the bitch on the boat by the shore
100 thousand for my diamond Chuck Norris
I fucked your bitch, when she call I ignore her
Sold out shows went Atlanta, did Dora
On the jet ski with my Rollie in Florida
If I lose it, fuck it, buy some more water
Come back with the chopper like the game Mordor
I'm ahead of time, I bought a portal
I watch a brick cross over the border
I took her phone cause she a recorder
Quavo Capone, I give you tutorial
I'm the greatest you've witnessed, this shit is historical
Me and Nast talkin' mils
Shoulda played for the Bills
Still trappin', servin' wings
Buffalos on my team
Put the dope on the beam
That's the honest shit I've ever seen
Because the scale tell the truth
And the money counter too
Big chopper, that's a whopper
I tried to buy a helicopter
But instead I bought a Benz
Then disect the engine like doctors
I heard he was a crime stopper
I heard he was a crime stopper
He growed up to be a copper
I growed up to be a robber

Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
Coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers

What you gon' do when you look on your camera, them young niggas comin' in with the bananas?
They heard you been ridin' around in the Phantom, they watchin', they know that you got it
I put my ho on the mission, she fucked him, she watchin' his pocket
Where is my ski? I'm gon' have to kill 'em, I must have forgot it
Go get the F&N, cock it, screw it on, I kill you in silence
Wait, I thought he was straight, so why he keep hoopin' and hollerin'?
I was rappin' and robbin' while you niggas was callin' tip offin
Hit the lick for a Tec and a carbon
Write his name in with the permanent marker
I pull out the Glock and I aim at your carcass
Offset for president, vote me in office
I be movin' the dope from Dakota to Boston
I maneuver through niggas, you talk, they gon' off you
How you gangster when you graduated from law school?
When the police pull up you the one that they talk to
Watch out for your partner, he work with the law too
Fuck it, knock him off, I hate that I lost you
When I beat the nigga, tried to bring out a lawsuit
That's the type of shit a copper gon' do
Beg for your life like a hostage gon' do
I'm pimpin' your bitch in Vegas prostitutin'
Robbin' you niggas, fuck it, then I'm shootin'
If I rob you on accident, call up Ken Nugent
Qua' rock that nigga, he thought it was bookie
Head for Somalian, cook up some cookies

Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
Coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers

Coppers, robbers, mobsters, lobsters
Audi R8, no Charger
Private jet land in Pearl Harbor
Comin' up I was a robber
If it was worth the wrapper we did rob ya
Can't fuck with these niggas, they fakin', hatin', writin' statements in permanent markers
Money come back like it's karma
Diamonds, they bitin', piranhas
Make that bitch work, Rihanna
No Tarzan, but the jungle I conquer
Run with that work, don't fumble
Run with it Forrest, don't fumble
Rob a nigga like I'm Curtis Snow
But move like I'm Barrack Obama
I know a copper when I see a copper from  robbin' niggas, let's be honest
Takin' the adventurous trips, Jumanji, stashin' money in the dungeon
The difference between us fourth down, I'm goin' for it and you puntin'
After I fuck her the first round, tell that bitch not to touch me
Nigga's face look disgustin', come out cookie blunt musty
Bad bitch but she busty, she gon' take the charge for me
Kick in the door nigga, run it, make a move and leave ya ugly
What they sayin'? The cops comin', pussy nigga called the cops on me

Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers
Coppers and robbers
You wanna play? You wanna play?
Coppers and robbers, coppers and robbers

The Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, the Masi
The Bentley, the Fisker, the Jag, the Rover
With a bad bitch like Hova
My wrist it be spinning and spinning like it got a motor
Fifty bricks in the Toyota, trapping off the motorola!
Through this same time, it was last year
Migo gang still with the top,  Migo gang
Niggas wasn't fucking with me
Now they wanna fuck with me
Cause they see on tv in that Versace
I know that they hate it, I know that they hate it
I know that they praying we won't make it
Momma told me, ""Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters.""
16 stuffing zips in my windbreaker
Hanging with the OGs and the killers
Then that windbreaker turned to a chinchilla
No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whipping it, whipping that Hitler then hop in that Fisker


It was all a dream like Biggy
Grind hard, committed, Migo gang lieutenant
Lost a lot, now we winning
From the Hondas to Bentleys
First of all I wanna say ... fuck the feds
Wanna see a nigga locked up or dead
Straight up out the county, straight to the fortune
Remember back in the day broke on the porches
Smokin gas, 
sipping mud,
 driving in them Porsches
Now we traveling the world like a fucking orbit
Thousand dollars pair Giuseppes, no more rocking Jordans
Fully loaded Rolex for my son, Jordan
Now he looking up to daddy like my daddy important
Rolls Royce or the Maybach, that’s boss choices
Kick this shit like I'm Chuck ""Offset"" Norris
Rasputia my pockets they fat, don't mistake me for Norbit
WHOA!


Ever since day 1, had to juug some
Momma told me, 'better not run into these houses son""
What you mean ma? We gotta keep the lights on
She said, ""Quavo you might run into the wrong one""
It was 2 years ago, it feel like it was yesterday
Task force around my house looking for a case
Turning on the channel news then I see my face
Turn myself in cause I know my lawyer beat the case
Then we dropped Bando, hoes go loco
How dare a nigga ever disrespect the Migos
Could see that hater look in the eyes, the way we hit em by surprise
Cause we blowing up like inner tube tires
Now look at my life rocking the ice, rocking the mic
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ikes
(Versace!) Damn right I changed my life
I hope I motivated young niggas to get their money right
Now this is for the people let em know that we some young rich niggas
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single

Flying Coach,YRN 2 (Young Rich Niggas 2),2016.0,"I can’t love her, ‘cause she like a ghost
That bitch that do the most
She like ... ghost
I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most
Oh!

I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach

I got so many decisions, ravens fly with the pigeons
I beat the pot, while you be the witness, try me – we don’t aim at kidneys
I throw back a perc’ to call my tensions; we pipe it up in the city
I got your hoe in my DM’s; I got your hoe at my mentions
The plug, he live in my mansion
He got bitches in the kitchen dancing
Then they gone for a month
Then go to trapping all the way in Kansas
Nigga never rode a transit
Hit the pot, like a canvas
Feeling like Jamie Foxx, ‘cause I’m in love with a bitch named Fancy
This game is dirty like a fucking Banshee
When I started getting money, now you can’t stand me
I almost lost my life, one night in Miami
I go back to Miami, drinking out the hammock

I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach

I cannot love her, that bitch do the most
Want to slam my door, what you mad at me for?
Mad ‘cause I didn’t let you come to my show
But you calling my phone, standing at my front door
Is you mad ‘cause I didn’t take you serious, hoe?
Comedian bitch, you delirious, hoe
Kill yourself, jump off the building
I walk in the kitchen, grab the knife, and go slit your throat
I don’t do favors; you know that’s a no
Fucked them up on the dab, going up on the show
Kicking a door, when the bando get slow
F-f-f-fuck up the pot, they want more
These bitches fucking for (zero)
These bitches give it up
I guess you want lust for the trust
I’m like a squirrel; I just want me a nut
Take the pot and I give it an uppercut
Most of these niggas be dick riding nowadays
Tell these niggas to wrap it up
Like an octopus, I’m getting money in eight ways
Young Takeoff, my stack is up
Since I remember, two years ago made ‘em say bando
Now they say pipe it up
Remember they talked down and doubted us
Now when I walk the Earth, I make the street erupt

I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most
I gave her all I had, and now she ghost, (lil bitty bitch) now she ghost
Independent, we been jumped up out the porch, (lil bitty bitch) jumped up out the porch
We fly business; you mad ‘cause you flying coach, (lil bitty bitch) yeah you flying coach

I can’t be loving this hoe
This bitch like the green light; this bitch like to go
I gave her the Beamer; I gave her the Rolls
But this little bitch still gon’ creep on her toes
I see the moves, so I watch how I move
She fucking niggas; she tryna’ to be cool
She broke as a bitch; she got nothing to lose
Giving it up just to put on some Loub’s
How can I lie, bet that thing like a pool
All of these bitches be loving the crew
Ain’t no one on one we fuck by the two
YRN fashion, I’m dabbing on you
You mad at me now, so I’m laughing at you
You something to do; you get hit in a room
Mama told me not to jump over broom
They hungry for money, they tryna’ get grooms
I like this bitch; she got an attitude
I think that I like the bitch, but I can’t wife the bitch
I’m in a Lambo, look what racks do
Whipping up crack; I can make a deuce
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two
Bringing it back, make a brick turn to two!

I can’t love her, ‘cause she do the most, (lil bitty bitch) yeah she do the most

That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced (Pussy)

Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)

Remember the time, I did my first break and enter?
Me, myself & I ain't had nobody wit me
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
6 period plotted on my teacher had to hit for that fundraiser fanny pack
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said ""Damn boy I can catch contact""
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks

Diamond shine came from Africa (Shine, shine, Africa)
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors (Ooh, dab, bachelor)
Turn the club to a massacre (fuck it up, fuck the club up)
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya (pitiful, sad to say)",https://genius.com/Migos-memoirs-lyrics
Playa Playa,Yung Rich Nation,2015.0,"I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon)
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

See one thing you can't do is you can't play a player
I done did everything that you did, and I've been everywhere
She riding on Toyota, have you ever been on a Lear?
A California foreign baby, something you can barely steer
Wait hold up, that's something you can't afford
You say you want that for real, well I can lease that Porsche of course
Take her to the mall, shutdown your favorite store
Have her walking out with bags, she don't wanna shop no more
Damn, Dolce Gabbana's, Alexander McQueen, she want red bottoms
This bitch she say she want her hair just like Rihanna's
And she know daddy money longer then Rapunzel
My diamonds stone cold she thinks she want a stunner
The way I kick it shawty thought I was a punter
Try to play me like I'm crazy, make me think that she famous
But I got one question baby, how the fuck you thinking that you gon' play a player?

I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant

Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

No she can not play me like a Playstation
Pull up and I drop her off Atlantic Station
You know I don't want nothing but some penetration
So hit me later, tell me what's the situation
You know It's nothing
She said she never been to Atlanta now she coming
Flying from a foreign country, trying to get into something
Really she don't know nothing, can't play a player
Baby girl I want you on the northside, welcome to my world
Then why the hell she so mad then
She ain't got nothing but a little back end
She hop in the front of the Bentley coupe
And she give me brain that's frontin'
Her phone ring, she hop out my Bentley like her grandmama was calling
I ain't seen her since then, and she still keep calling
Can't play a player
They say she got a man, keep her shopping out on Rodeo
Imma let him do it, I ain't gonna spoil her, I'm a player
No not gon' sell no dream, this ain't no fairy tale
They say that you cuffing her, nigga you working for 12

I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
Bitch go back to watching basic cable
If she thinking she can play a player
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon')
Playa playa, playa playa (nah, never)
Playa playa, playa playa (thinkin' she gon)
That bitch she think that she gon' play a player

I'm a player, bitches calling me Bill Bellamy
She want my formula, can't give away my recipe
Italy, Hawaii, Beverly, it don't even matter to me
I'm on the road every day, somebody come call for me
The rings, the chains, the bezels, you ain't even on my level
Gotta fit you in my busy schedule
I can help you get your life together, I'm flyer than a feather
In any weather, I'm a player
We can swap these bitches out nigga and trade them
I've never been the cuffing type, I'm no lifesaver
I put a hole in your nigga, he like a bagel
I'm on the molly calling Scotty like I'm Fabo
You not a J-Lo, you a OK ho
Shut the fuck up before I beat it on my table
Number one rule in the player book
Never cuff a bitch that one of your partners done hit

I can take you places you ain't never been
You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen

You can keep all of your Louboutin tennis shoes, all that jewelry, those things are material (those things ain't nothing)
Cause those 15 bitches on my telephone, want to go to my top floor condo in Rome (top floor condo)
Sneaking and geeking -- sucking less them leaches, lobby runned up with some Puerto Ricans and they freaky
She suck me all night till I sleep, Whipping up a brick a nigga drinking Easter Pink
Like you love a nigga bitches they be  shopping overseas,                   I can take a nonbeliever and I make that bitch believe
Does she cook it, does she flip it right? That bitch could live with me
If she can stand on the block with the brick and run from the Police
She ain’t got no problem bringing back the product to me
Whip a chicken in the kitchen I send that bitch in the streets.  (Whipping it!)

Black and white Bentley Musalnne but I am not racist
Traveling around the world to go get Benjamin faces

Rest in peace Pistol my nigga not coming back
Smoking on dry cause it come from a laundrymat
I got your bitch sucking me up, no Similac
Chopper nail a nigga like he a thumbin' tack
Call up Rel Money if you want a Migos show
Front end and back end, you sending that
If I take a loss I'ma get it back
They stealing the flow and I'm sick of that
Show me that pink slip cause you rented that
Ain't going back and forth cause I ain't here for that
Yung Rich Nation jeans, my thirty up under that
I've been balling but no Tennessee, plenty racks
They separated from the white and black mansion
No angry white people, we living that
All my bad bitches boss up
Broke bitches need to fall back
Nat nat alley cats
Back of the building fucking on my hoodrats
I'm dabbin' and watchin' like Cinemaxx
Dab on your bitch and I give her a heart attack
You still call it swag, don't call it that
And these niggas know we was the one started that
First I grab the mic, blow a stack, then I fall back
Racks and stacks taller than Shaq, but how good is your pack?
You need to get up and get off your ass and get you a sack
Ain't talking bout money, ain't tryna hear that then fall back

Bad bitches boss up (boss up ay)
Broke bitches fall back (fall back ay)
Rich nigga boss up (boss up ay)
Broke nigga fall back (fall back ay)

Trapping out the houses, with boards on the windows
A lot of y'all claim bandos but I know y'all pretenders
You know we the beginners, originate inventors
If you knocking at my bando more than twice you cannot enter
Fishscale rocking
Cooking in Versace
Niggas baller blocking
Feds still watching
Molly sent in, percocet, xans
Break a whole pound down, cap off extra grams
Trap season ‘come tax season, Uncle Sam
Bricks all white like the hair off of Sisqo
Pots real greasy like I wiped it down Crisco
Pulled up on a young nigga ask him what he lick for
50 packs in the hood because I made it rappin'
Gave a cutie to my niggas down the road I made it happen
Gave straps to my niggas that I knew was bout that action
Birds sangin', Toni Braxton, in my trunk, I'm swerving traffic

Trapping out the houses, got more cheese than mouses
Kicking in your door, I'm looking for the fucking ounces
Wave around that chopper I'm intimidate spouses
Flipping over sofas, found a 100 in the couches
20 bales of soft, I let that alarm go off
Jerz know he slurred trippin to let one off
What the fuck nigga, you trippin', you want the police to run up in the house?
He said he won't give the key up to the safe, I'm bout to put this strap in his mouth

Fuckin' these bitches don't want no scrub

First time I poured up nigga it was a zip now it's fours and fifths, nigga I'm talkin' real mud

Say the right thing at the wrong time or the wrong place, broad day we gon' wet your ass up

I'm in your crib every day, what's brackin'?
I fuck your bitch everyday, what's brackin'?
Came in the club with a K, what's brackin'?
Niggas know I put the K in crackin'
Look at my money, it's everlastin'
Me and my niggas, we young and wildin'
Y'all talkin' tough, he ain't know nothin'
My niggas silent, ain't really violent
I ain't go to school or graduate college
When I got a car, it got good mileage
And I got a house, big ass mansion
Something for all the lil' thots to dance in
I remember scrapin' the pots, yeah
Cannot forget 'bout the pot, yeah
I had rocks in my socks, yeah
Remember, I was servin' your pops, yeah

R.I.P. to my pops, yeah
Even though he ain't do much, uh
Guess I still miss him alot, yeah
So I got our memories tucked away
R.I.P. to my opps, yeah
Just pissed on them graves the other day
If they catch me, they won't hesitate
So I got my hand on my nine today, uh
I up it, I bust it, ain't no discussion
I make a nigga hyperventilate
I fuck on a thot, ain't no cuddle, she bust it open
Then I'm bustin' all over her face
These groupie bitches, they be scandalous
Come with a rubber, I'ma penetrate
I took his bitty on a dinner date
But not for really, I just fucked the face
I keep a few milli's stashed away
Water, diamonds like a castaway
Triple 9, nigga, that's the wave
I be on the 'Gram, workin' everyday
I gotta make sure that my paper straight
Don't got a gun, you get hit with the razor blade
Shoot for the stars, I've been throwin' up fadeaways
Feds with the drum, they make 'em fade away
Heavily armed, shoot, make 'em levitate
I'm not the one, pussy don't play with me
Chains on my arms, this is not slavery
Diamonds and charms, my wrists on super freeze
Feel like LeBron, I've just been scorin'
Hit on rewind, world-wide tourin', life is fun
Niggas wanna hate, grab me a gun
Send him up to heaven, losin' his life
[Chorus: Juice WRLD & 
Offset

I'm in your crib every day, what's brackin'?
I fuck your bitch everyday, what's brackin'?
Came in the club with a K, what's brackin'?
Niggas know I put the K in crackin'
Look at my money, it's everlastin'
Me and my niggas, we young and wildin'
Y'all talkin' tough, he ain't know nothin'
My niggas silent, ain't really violent
I ain't go to school or graduate college
When I got a car, it got good mileage
And I got a house, big ass mansion
Something for all the lil' thots to dance in (
Woo, hey

I remember scrapin' the pots, yeah (
Skrrt

Cannot forget 'bout the pot, yeah (

Seen 100 bands, all in one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mind cuz my mama seen it (fuck!)
And she had a fit, yea she had a fit (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich (rich, go!)

Mama had a fit when she seen my money
She say you ain’t got no job, you must be up to something
What the hell you doin? Don’t get in no trouble
I had to look out for my nephew, he look up to uncle
Mama got a nigga, I ain’t like his ass
Tried to make me rake the leaves and cut the grass
Nigga you ain't even got no kids, what make you dad?
If I wasn't 12 years old I’d bust yo ass!
Mama kicked him out and now I’m 21
Bought her Prada, Gucci, Louis, Christian Loubuitton
Mama taught me everything, I’m her Danielson
I had to go get her that Porsche before the summer’s gone
(Hook)
(Verse) (Gucci Mane)
I was servin junkies out my mama window
I was broke like half a brick, that was ‘96
Daddy gone so I guess that makes me head honcho
Mama ramblin through my closet, she done found a spliff
She said I raised you better, boy you’ve got a strong mind
She said I can’t believe you serve that to your own kind
I told her mama chill cuz I been broke along time
That’s why I’m at the store and junkies in a long line
I was a runner for my brother, I need my own plug
I feel like 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, I need my own drugs
First time I set shop on my block I didn’t get no luck
200 thousand for a Charger, 6’s, no scrub
(Hook)
(Verse) (Takeoff of the Migos)
The Audi, the Mazzi, the Jaguar
The Bentley, the house by the lake
Gold on my neck, gold on my wrist
Young Takeoff I sit on 10 K’s
I’m posted with Guwop, I’m strapped up with 2 Glocks
Versace on my back, I’m feelin like 2 Pac
He wanted a whole brick, I gave em re-rock
Pull up on yo block, Chevrolet t-top
Finesse the plug for the bags
My wrist is spinnin like Taz
I know that my mama gone spaz
She find out bout all of this cash
But fuck it, my nigga we rich
Remember them nights hitting licks
Duckin police, jumpin the fence
Now we in Lambs, president tint

After all the pain that we went through
I don't even wanna rewind it
Free all my niggas went down in the system
Send the Green Dot cause I miss 'em
R.I.P. my nigga Pistol, can't believe the bullet hit him
Sometimes a young nigga might wanna cry
But I can't let you niggas see it

Now I got riches so bitches they miss me
Wanna know what you been doin' all this time
Why you ain't got no money on your mind
Together we stand, we fall apart then we divide
Fuck the police we might start up a riot
This shit is so pitiful, had to pay money for my nigga's funeral
That was my nigga we had so much unity
I got in my heart, he on top and he smilin'
Used to talk about a fuckin' rivalry
What about police that take a bribery?
They don't give a fuck about people in poverty

Story I Tell,Rich Nigga Timeline,2014.0,"Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school

Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It’s a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don’t weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks
QC the label got mega bucks
Gas off in the back of the spinner bus
Say that you trapping, really you got touch and bust
This is the life of the Hefty bags
You know that them ounces don’t weigh enough

I came a long way from dropping the fishes
Finessing the plug for his riches
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it
Came a long way from that midget
Money taller than a midget
I keep the mac like a midget

Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliment
QC my label, and that’s my establishment
Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent
Me and my niggas spread the butter, margarine
Marvin the Martian, got Raris, I cut off the engines, now park it
You can catch a bullet in your carcass
100 band juug, and you wasn’t a part
I took the plug off and we had a departure
You telling a story bout me, I’m the author

Whipping babies, I’m not talking bout toddlers

Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckin'
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
Couple straps, they wasn't even dirty
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when I knew that somebody was workin'
We the only niggas in the back
I had to hand big 12 my fuckin' strap
What I'ma do with my pack?
Damn, I put that shit right in my bag
12 lookin' at us, mad
Cause we thuggin' and our pants sag
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn
Soon as we thanked our fans
We walked off the staged
Then walked through the locker room, they was cuffin' our hands
Hold up, ain't no talkin', no discussion
They threw us in the paddy van (paddy!)
Shit, we all said, ""Fuck it""
Whatever happen's God's plans

I had to sit down once again in the pen
Denyin' my bond once again and again
We kept it solid, don't fold and don't bend
Had to beat a nigga tryna steal up out my Benz
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I would jump the fence
Sat on my box, read a book while I vent
Didn't do a show, but I still got my percent (cash!)
Felt like I lost it, but I got it back
She archin' her back in the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I'm not goin' back
Back on the road, 80 thou', we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
Sleepin' one eye open, Silver without a patch (I see you!)
They set us up knowin' we stay with them straps
You not a boss cause it's somethin' you lack
Minor setback for a major comeback
Smokin' on gas, 
breathin' like Toni Brax
Back to the bando and back to the trap
Face in my Backwood, I'm not tryna match
Got on my knees and asked God to help me
Actin' like I don't know you like I got amnesia
Portraits in my mansion of Mona Lisa
My partners beggin' me just like they Felicia

Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
Poured me a four and went out of it
Tried to hit a nigga in the head with so many charges
Should've caught a concussion
When I got to the show I woke up, didn't know nothin'
All I seen was police, sheriff, and drug enforcers
Took that, zipped up my hoodie then I got the TEC
And I asked for the Ozium cause it was musty (spray!)
But it's too late for all that cause they lookin'
Now it's 'bout time to walk into the buildin'
My gat's in my britches, I keep smellin' cookies
No this ain't a wrap, but I smell what they cookin'
When I was on stage, I didn't have a feelin'
That they was behind me plottin', tryna get me
If I knew then what a nigga had seen
Promise we would not be in this predicament
Had a zip in my net when I got jammed
Went to the toilet, threw and flushed it down
Lookin' cause it wasn't no cameras around
Autistic when they come to question on sound
Not talkin' so whatever you know, you found
But you ain't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searchin' so hard, left some drank in the ground
Fuck all that shit, my nigga's out the slam
Nah forreal, Takeoff!

Welcome to my party, got that bitch, she poppin' molly
Walk up in the trap house, got me sneezin' like they pollen
QC the label, my nigga, they solid
Hit them with the choppa, Master P body
Poppin' seal, no Mike Will we made it
I got my dick up in her mouth like Colgate
No deal, keep it real, no fugazi
I got a mill, I put the tats on my face
Have a party at the mansion with 20 acres
You got foes at the gate like you got hit with tasers
Fuck your bitch, I don't save her
She poppin' the molly bite down like a gator
Wanna have a party?
20-30 bitches in the lobby
Take her clothes off, we on an island
She can ride a nigga then she got the talent
I be layin' right on the money like a pallet
We be tossin' up the bitches like a salad
Trappin', dabbin', plus I'm havin'

Wiped the semen off with a napkin

Old school Chevy t-top you can have the Ferrari
Wanna party all night, take molly all night, got a white girl screamin' gnarly
Stop lookin' over here, can't get in V.I.P
Wanna put the molly all up on your lips
Got a nice ass, got some nice hips
Wanna hop up in a nigga's spaceship
Wanna party? (Wanna Party?)
If you get out of line, I'mma shoot up the party
Pull up to the valet, gotta park a nigga Bugatti
When I hop off Versace, Giuseppe my toe, I got guap in my pocket
Look at my wrist, it got boogers on it, gotta know that they sloppy

My jeweler up in the cooler you cannot find it
Before you walk my trap, I'm checkin' for the wires

When I first seen a thou, nigga got inspired
A nigga trap in the nighttime, no Michael Myers

Pull up on the block, I had to Forgiato my tires

Young nigga battled for a hustle mentalities
On the northside I was trapping, capping
Made a million dollars independent, I seen it
Pockets on Mondo Burger, call me Kenan
Then I fucked your ho, now she can see me
Giving me a massage, I think she orthopedic
Who want the problem, you don't want no trouble
We pull up and solve 'em
Shout out my driver, he get a million on the highway

Telling on your brother, working with the undercover

BAH CLAH CLAH, let it burn just like it's Usher
Got the 40, call me Michael Finley, 50 bricks up in the fender
Hit the nigga with the semi
Hit the witness, we don't get a sentence
Migo the army, Young Offset lieutenant
AK-47 tall as a midget
Migos on top of you niggas like we is the gunner
Focusing on my grind, I do it for my brother
My niggas keep a Magnum, I ain't talking about a rubber
You don't want to go to war, I ain't talking about a tugs
Niggas be swimming, drowning up in the blood puddle (Pussy!)
Put a nigga up under the ground, call him Harriet Tubman

And any bitch that you with ain't shit, no shit, dig it
Anybody fucking with me know what it is
That shit that you be talking about we did it for real
I told my nigga Doe B Imma get him a mill
He died in December and we getting it still
Hopping out Ferrari with a pocket full of money
.40 in my trunk, bust down a couple hundred
Gambling on the pool table lost me a couple hundred
Then I struck a dice game and tripled my money
Lames that belong on the wall of shame
Well you can check my stats, I'm in the hall of fame
Bitch nigga better miss me with all the games
Before I pull the chopper, decorate the wall with brains
And I ain't fucking round with it
Last 13 years he ain't fucked around, did he?
Even as a young nigga, bossing up around Diddy
Fighting with the bouncer, walking out of Magic City
Going over to The Cheetah pocket full of Velveeta
Hear the name through the speakers, what it do my nigga?

Get big bankroll is what we do my nigga, aye!

Any nigga wanna pull up with me, tell 'em pull up and just say their name
The chopper is 'bout to decapitate brains
All I wanted was the check
Diamonds on my wrist and neck
Making money, niggas calling me Mitch
Rick James, I'm rich
A lot of niggas start dabbing
A lot of niggas said they haven't
That's a lot of hoes in my kitchen
Kim Kardashian's with no panties

Drop the top on the Bentley and it’s over
Hop in the Porsche and pull over
Dropping a four in my soda
I fucked that bitch at the

I’m having cash and it’s on me
Welcome to the mansion, this a castle
Hop in the pool, it’s deep
Never meet a nigga like me

You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, ""Boy, Quavo what's really in it?""
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the 5
Stand up and bust with the 5

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga Pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

I can't believe it, how I got these bitches
They suckin' me like they some leeches
These niggas, they actin' like bitches, they wanna take pictures
They not a rapper on a feature
Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my cabin fever
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina, Indonesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of ""Versace"" money
Mentions ran off the meter

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it

Can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it

Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
Used to be in the bando with egg beaters
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and accounted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Your situation, don't take life for granted
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Fuck it, we took the rap game, held it ransom
Give it up!

Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold

Want my niggas to be free so they can just see how we livin'

Came from the bottom and now I got guala
Turn the page, my nigga, we on the next chapter
Trapper turned rapper
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Your ho was creeping like tarantulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in the ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
Came from kicking doors, juugin' plug for the bows
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I don't see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics in black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one

Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up
If I catch a mug I'll charge a private jet to Canada
Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?

Penthouse elevator, it'll elevate yah
Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
Got that price on your head, nigga like a alopecia
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor

Rubber band Benjamin's stashed in my vault
Thinkin' I'm Chris Tucker the way that my money talk
I'ma take that fork and that pot
Scrapin' it, tryna make me a knot
Nigga woke up trapping on the block
Fuck it I'm looking out for the cops
Puttin' my wrist in my pot until my heart stop
Free my niggas that be locked up in the cell block
Junkies hit my dope and they feelin' like Hancock
In the bando, I'm Shaquille O'Neal with the blocks
She gone make you fall in love when you meet her
24 karat gold eggbeater
El Chapo, Griselda told me how to treat her

Pull out the chopper, they scared of the chrome
Underground tunnel right under the dome

Young nigga came from the nawf

Thirty thousand for a Rollie
To you, I spent a lot of guacamole
Take a look in my jewelry box, it's open
I got the cash, they say you got tokens
Where the receipt at?
Tell your watch is stolen
Now everybody say they got a Rollie
Remember one year ago rocking Mike Kors
Now when I shop different bags in the stores
Cash out on a Audemar shining just like the stars
My jewelry box came with some burglary bars
My diamond dancing singing El Dabarge
I treated my diamonds like beauty bars
My diamonds different colors, living colors
They be jumping around like a rock star
No Jackson 5 but it's 3 of us brothers
We keep the Nina now we pop stars
While you sitting there watch me on instagram
You can count the rings on my fucking hand
Only eight fingers a hundred bands
Seventy racks for my Migo man
Thirty K for Quavo Rolex
She want it so bad that's a price check
Came from trapping and now I do mic check
I will take your life dare you to touch my neck

Sleep Walking,Streets On Lock 4,2015.0,"Ayy, wake up nigga!
Fuckin' sleep walking and shit
It's 'bout time they free my brother Offset
Free Mango
Free John Wick
Streets on lock!

Sippin' codeine got me sleep walking
Hit the plug with the motherfuckin' re-rock
Don't speak to me nigga talkin' cheap talk
Got the plug pulling up on the speed boat
In the trap dunking bricks like the tomahawk
A hundred thousand dollar what the chain cost
Spent two hundred thousand just to chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Chop the brain off
I'm a go ahead and chop the brain off
Forgiatos spinning on a drop top
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off
Drop the top off
I'm a go ahead and drop the top off

Dropping the top I do surgery
Porsche 911 emergency
Back seat Bentley like I posed to be
I'm rich and famous don't get close to me
Young nigga what you know pulling up in the room with a bad bitch looking like a coca cola
I go 0-100 with a Lamb motor
You a loco choco, migo gang, we going global
I'm an ignorant nigga drop the brain off the rain
Forty thousand for the Rollie and it plain jane
Two pistols on me nigga call me Max Payne
I'm a fool with the rock like LeBron James
Sippin' syrup in the 'Rari watch me swerve
I came along way from the curb
I'm flyer than an eagle and an old school bird
I need my money ASAP not talking Ferg

Sippin' codeine got me sleep walking
Hit the plug with the motherfuckin' re-rock
Don't speak to me nigga talkin' cheap talk

I'm a go ahead and drop the top off
Pull up in the 'Rari with the sawed off
At the top nigga never gonna fall off
She be fuckin' and suckin' just for a shoutout
Migos in the arena I know it's sold out
You mouth open wide young nigga close your mouth
Pull up in convertible them niggas hurt my nigga Pistol P and this shit really hurt to me
Back then when a nigga kick doors and juug bags I ain't have a vacuum seal, nigga had a sandwich bag
Now I made it nigga having millions
Drop the top call it banana peeling
When I step out like a polar bear young nigga chillin'
And she knowin' Migos in the building
Pull up to the condo cause she feel me
Cut the top off the coupe like a pair of scissors

Sippin' codeine got me sleep walking
Hit the plug with the motherfuckin' re-rock
Don't speak to me nigga talkin' cheap talk

Plug Talk,Streets on Lock 3,2014.0,"I talked to Pedro, Pedro told me talk to Nino
Nino he been jugging he got everything illegal
And Nino he dont know that Pedro told me about the kilos
If i ever catch him slipping bet i take all his burritos
I called Nino up and said I want a half a brick Plug Talk
Walking ATM bitch you can't front me shit
Pick me up on the block at 6 o'clock make then birds flock
What the Fuck there go 12

Ahh shit look at this 
This nigga Nino tried to hit a fucking lick
Thought I was sleep
He think he slick
Had to hit'em with that F&N lil bitty bitch
Look at you now
All on the ground
Where is yo chain where is yo work weight, gimme it now
Looking around watching for 12
Loyalty over royalty my nigga won't tell, gas bags call em Shell
38 revolver catching shells
I'm not leaving no evidence shooting all witnesses even yo manager
Look out for cameras
Nigga trying to catch me slipping flip em like a spatula
I tried to bargain with Nino but Nino he told me I had the monifah
Caught him and his señorita
Slipping and took a trip to Argentina


Pedro hit my phone say he ready
'Bout to touchdown on some p's good gas unleaded
They say the plug in the jungle with machete
And Takeoff with the choppa Offset got the Mac 11
Flippa go get the pound, fuck nigga don't move better lay it down
This a M&M lick lil bitch if we hit this shit we gone be rich
I take a look under the sofa
It's keys to a brand new Rover
Offset went and search that whip, when he came back, he had a 100 bricks
Now that's what I call successful, you niggas is peasants
My bitch is so bad she came from Miss Universe beauty pageant
You talk about shit that I've done
You cannot judge my chromatic
Look at me now, counting my millions in mega mansions


See Nino and Rico related
They heard that I'm trapping out vacants
These hundreds the come from the 80's
My money old, my money is ancient
I'm on a mission like a agent
Ducked off in the bushes be patient
Got plugs across the whole nation
Got Haitian, Jamaican and Asian
I'm serving the J's the white, Caucasian
Back in the day selling knicks on the pavement
Extorting you niggas, nigga make a payment
 on the block, send my niggas to take em
This nigga Nino really think that he slick
30 clip left a nigga in a ditch
My nigga Pedro got a young nigga rich
And every story he tell is legit",https://genius.com/Migos-plug-talk-lyrics

Mama told me that you always gotta go read the Bible
Sippin on a 20 oz, I got 4 zips in the bottom

Problems,Green Album: Get Rich Everything Else Is Nonsense,2014.0,"I been balling so long but I don't want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don't want no problems
Hundred thousand worth of crosses, I don't want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don't want no problems
Pullin' up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
They can't see me with that wooly, they gon' swear it's a problem
I'm gon' slide down your hood when you and your girl having problems
OG bag 'pose to be in, what the world is the problem?

I'ma wrap my money it look like Oprah Winfrey
I'ma sell one of my mansions, everything new but the kitchen
Ain't no cypher, no no wrestler, but I'm wrapping in midget
And I'm master selling them P's, now my money no limit
I got my bed up, I shed up, don't let up, no police, I'm fed up
They cannot forget us, I got your schedule, I fuck up your schedule
I shoot at your head, your dreads, they buy us
You bitches just know it's too hard to get by us
I'm not advertising but boy you can try us
I sing to your bitch and she call me Mariah
I see and read everything 'round me but bibles
Bugatti I swear, I'm not gonna hurt anybody
I swear I'm not gonna tell anybody
Just get it this molly and stand right beside me
I'm with PeeWee Longway

Run up on my brother Takeoff, I'ma whoop you like Rico

My nigga keep pistols grenades and missiles
My diamonds they cold as icicles I'm trapping and making a deal like a pickle
I am the nigga you want to be
My diamonds they black just like Willie B
Niggas in the hood they know me
I walk around with the set, no army
Porsche Panamera, one button, top gone
All these bad bitches, Spanish hoes, Hong Kong

Without throwing on true, your religion is fool
Old ass money but the whip brand new
On brand new shoes, got brand new jewels
Whipping that Yayo, looking like mayo
It come from Barbados, my wrist is tornado
I kick it like Kato, hundred round drums
Walking with bombs, serving the junkies they asking for crumbs
And it ain't no problem, got that revolver
Think you a problem, I got to solve you
We ducking police like we felons
Put two hundred on your watermelon
That's your head, or cerebellum

Takin' 'bout how many drugs in that vacant

Gangsta rap comin' back like a nigga got 80's crack with an 8-track
Come in your house, where the safe at?
Homey don't play that

I'm in the trench coat for the skies
I keep the .45 on my waistline
Shoot your block down with the Glock like a alpine
Fuck it shoot the club up call me Shyne
These Balmains no Calvin Kleins
Flood my neck with that gold like Busta Rhymes
That Migos on the billboard worldwide we recognized
A lot of these niggas wanna be recognized
But get caught jammed up not gonna do the time
I know some niggas they got acquitted
And they didn't want tell and get crucified
I'm smoking on OG, it ease my mind
Need some Visine cause I got the red eyes
Ain't thinking 'bout a bitch I'm getting money cause these bitches come and go like red eyes
Now I'm recognized taking trips in my lamb I own it no enterprise
Looking at niggas can't be mad at niggas cause nigga just want to be recognized

I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
Now I'm having recognition 
 (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition 
 (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition 
 (Recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be recognized 
 (Recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition

Momma said recognize God
I recognized then my momma had pain in her eyes
So I walked through the shadow, the valley of death
I'm addicted to drank and I can't even help it (lean, lean, drank, drank)
Pussy nigga taking selfies
Ask me for money I told that nigga no he go round the hood saying I'm selfish (huh?)
That's the reason that I left him
Your momma keep calling say help
She didn't recognized you was a failure
I wanted to be recognized
Went to the mall and bought me a 10 and told the school it caught me five
My OG taught me to be wise
Thanking the lord cause I'm recognized
VH1 you can go see it live
Now you see me shining now you want to ride (Skrrr)
They finally recognized
They copy the way we rhyme

I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
I just wanted to be recognized
Now I'm having recognition

Pull in the rari from Italy

She told me she can't wait to pop it
I told her, 'Go pop it all'
Then she told me just wake her, she free tomorrow
No, I cannot go, got a show, 50 K tomorrow
Look at my face, girl, I'm hungry
Hungry, that's meanin' I'm horny
Got 'em on at three or four in the mornin'
Makin' her eggs 8 A.M. in the mornin'

So nigga I do not have nothing to sell
The difference between me and your nigga
See the drip, if they get caught up my niggas won't tell
Born to go get it, mama raised me well
Only get one shot, gotta give 'em hell

Your bitch is a freak and her head in my lap
My diamonds so rocky like I'm with A$AP
My ho keep on calling and she want Chanel
Fuck all the fake hugs and dap
They wasn't in the trap and I know that these niggas gon' tell
My migo callin' and he servin' me bales
Got niggas down the road servin' them L's
Poppin' mollies got me high as a shell
I'm in the Maserati, don't got no air
I'm ridin' with Thugger like Santa ride with L
I'm totin' that Uzi, middle fingers up to 12
Never lay down and I""m givin' these pussy niggas hell
Diamonds dancin', can't you tell?

My ho just bumped my phone and said she want Chanel
My migo came to bless me with a hundred bales
I came up out the scale, I whip that fish and scale
My G say I'm not goin' to jail
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
Yeah, that's my clientele

Migo pull up with them birds and I cop them bitches and I serve them bitches
Then I blow the extras, motherfuck the digits
I was like greeny greeny like a fuckin' cricket
These niggas ballin' out, these niggas fallin' out
These niggas coppin' out
These niggas dancin', motherfucker walkin' out
You play with them yardsticks, you know they chalk you out
You don't need no lawyer 'cause they might swap you out
You never heard of that, you stupid nigga
Man my heart is racing 'cause I'm chasing figures
Leave that strap alone, when you became a killer?
You ain't never shot nothin', clap back at this
Your show gettin' so slow like a motherfuckin' caterpillar
I'm still wearin' water like Baptist niggas
When I spray some shit down don't catch up nigga
My house is big, I gotta map it nigga
Cook that rice, cook that rice
Hypnotize, 'til you hypnotize
I got white girl grits, this ain't no rice
I can get 'em hidden, chain gang for some price

My ho just bumped my phone and said she want Chanel
My migo came to bless me with a hundred bales
I came up out the scale, I whip that fish and scale
My G say I'm not goin' to jail
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales
My migo bumped my line, he got a hundred bales

Diamonds dancing, doing jumping jacks

Bitch for every letter in the alphabet
Bust down the Rollie, can't see where the time's at
Cut with the sack like I should have played lineback
Drunk me a 4 in the 20 ounce pineapple
Snake with my neck, I think I hear a rattle
Serving the junkies I grew up a bastard
Smoking moonrocks, I'm going to NASA
Bands on me like I'm having a battle
Sherbert the cookie, it don't even matter
Get to poppin' pills, you would think I have cancer
In the foreign gettin' road head from a dancer

I come in this bitch lit like a candle

Too many bricks, gotta sort 'em (bricks)

Everybody wanna see a young nigga hit the top
And then, fall off

When they gimme shine on
Everybody hate to see a nigga shine on
If you wanna real diamond, get your money up
And stop fucking buying rhinestones
Come in the game, like 
I kill y'all niggas, but I'm sending Takeoff
Told Offset to chill on the phone
He the richest fucking nigga walkin', 'round the jailhouse
It's me, in the panoramic
I know, that you, that hope, that I crash
You hope, that I total it
I'm-I'm-I'm taking your bitch to Hawaii, she be like ""Totally""
She rap to my music
But she from Europe, she listen to 
Yodele
Pull out that Uzi, pull out the Uzi

Pull up to the concert, know, it gon' sell out
Told mama, ain't nothing to cry about
But I told , put the camera, 'round the house now

Doctor said, grandma don't have too long
Still in denial, she can't be gone
All these nigga hating and smilling up in your face
All these damn blessings, I tell  my fame
I thought, I woulda made it, when I was up in the K
When I saw my brothers on the TV screen, I was amazed
The music is quality and we control every move, that we make
I'm at the top and you niggas
You lil' niggas only come up to my waist
And if it ain't dollars, you talking
Then, fuck nigga, get the fuck out of my face
And you been in the game so long
Why the fuck you wanna steal a nigga flow, anyway?
And no stopping me
My pocket filled up with that broccoli
It's only one man, who is over me
His son had to die, just to rescue me
When you at the top, niggas wanna see you fall
Same nigga hatin' make his bitch take it off
I know you nigga mad, 'cause a nigga took off
When it come to QC, my niggas will go to war

Lot of fuck nigga's tryin' take my life (fuck)
Lot of fuck nigga's tryin' take my life (huh?)
But I keep the thing on me so you better think my twice

Fuck nigga hatin', they envy me
Keep the pistol, fuck the felony
Snakes in the grass, they got jealousy
Keep my focus on my currency
The pistol I got come from overseas
You a fuck nigga, run up on it
Pussy ass nigga talking dirty
Hit them with the 30/30
Have them on life support in a coma
Put it on my momma
Young nigga keep the lama
Put a thing on a nigga
Now the nigga actin' humble
I ain't worried about nothing
Keep cash by the bundle
Offset don’t fumble, this the concrete jungle
Fuck nigga ain't hard nigga really is a fraud
I'm a take the nigga card
I'm a take a nigga heart
He got a pussy he a broad
Put it on my squad
If I happen to knock him hard
Then my nigga take the charge

Lot of fuck nigga's tryin' take my life (fuck)
Lot of fuck nigga's tryin' take my life (pussy)
Lot of fuck nigga's tryin' take my life
But I keep the thing on me so you better think my twice

Mama We Made It,Streets On Lock 4,2015.0,"Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it

Young nigga came from the bottom
Young nigga go get the guala
Trap out a hotel Ramada
They calling me Quavo Mufasa
Open the trap like carcass
We knowing you niggas imposters
They liking the Piña colada
I remix it with a lil' powder
Hit a nigga with a chopper
It will take about forty-eight hours
No Courage, you niggas is cowards
He got the pack and my niggas surround him
The Chattahoochee where they found him
My niggas go get the bounty
We hold 'em up for ransom
If a nigga get hot, leave the county
Migos on top of the mountain
Listen up boy, it's a Migos announcement
I got the pigeons and falcons
Now I got the keys, I used to trap ounces
Came from the boards on the houses
Them niggas is telling I'm calling them mouses
Beat the pack like Ronda Rousey
Free Bobby Shmurda and free my boy Rowdy
I came from the pavement
Look at them niggas they mad that I made it
Look at their faces
'Cause I'm at the top can nobody replace it
I used to be robbing
Hang with the goons, my niggas were goblins
Trap out the apartments
Turning the North side into a lil' Harlem

Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking
I fell in love with the faces
Quarterback Migos, Troy Aikman
Screaming out mama we made it

My niggas came from the pavement
So many chains like a slavery
Taking a trip to Croatia
Plug sent the pack be coming in from Haiti
Counting up these Benjamin faces
Young nigga, I got rich off of Caucasian
Migo my gang, ain't no trading
Fucking these bitches, they from different races
Rick Owens, they came with no laces
Cooking up dope and the junkies gonna taste it
Your bitch gave me brain, that's my favorite
Told that bitch watch her teeth 'cause she got braces
Remember me nigga, gon' envy me
People gon' hate on me, just 'cause I made it
Talk about me like we might be related
You need to sue your jewelry, Rollie outdated
Don't you twist your fingers if you ain't banging
I be in the bando with the dope boys slanging
Pouring up a soda, I leave it contaminated
All of my niggas that screaming out mama we made it
I know y'all niggas flexing for the check
Now one of them chains is yours around your neck
We start from the North side, screaming free Offset
I gave him a test, get a vest, and then get hit with the Tec

Put on a mask like Jason
Kicking your door and we raiding
My niggas came from the pavement
Talking that shit boy save it
You talking 'bout cookies, we baking

Pretty bitches show me cameltoes

Whipping up a storm, I’m bout to break my arm
Flush the dope, if the police coming then we shooting at them folks
Standing at the stove, cooking the Marilyn Monroe
She get back to cooking dope and Imma fuck her in the throat
Started from the bottom, we started up on the floor

Run to the money like Usain Bolt
We got way more Os than tic-tac-toes
Walk in Magic City like we walking in the snow
Tyler  earlobe, Givenchy on my toe
Cause I made it  think a nigga sold his soul
Trapping gas bags, toss a nigga like a toad
Free all my niggas down the road, I never told
When it’s coke I got the F&N in my coat
Cook a nigga like a pork if the money keep on coming short

I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a zip
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a ride
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for a dime
I ain't gotta  ask no nigga for nothing
I ain't gotta ask no nigga for nothing
Falisha, I ain't gotta ask no nigga
I ain't askin' no nigga, don't ask me, nigga
Falisha, I ain't gotta ask that nigga
I ain't askin' no nigga for shit, nigga
Falisha, act like Falisha, act like Falisha
Falisha, you act like Falisha, you act like Falisha

No I'm not askin' you niggas for nothin' because I don't need 'em
When I was down bad, was I really askin' you people?
I was hurtin', I really had to kick them doors and do shit illegal
Then we took off, at the top floor of the continental
Yep top floor, 
criss cross the block like the eyes on Debo (cock-eyed)
Gon' get my money, bitch and keep your eyes on the road
And then she asked me where we goin', I don't know
What's all of these questions for?
You actin' like your name Falisha, ho
Back then I was in everything
They thought I had legs like a centipede
Got tired of runnin' to my mama for shit
So I kicked me a door in at 17
All of my brothers depend on me
All of my sisters depend on me
Don't run up on me askin' me for nothin'
'Cause I'm takin' my people across the country


The fuck is you thinkin'
You think I'ma ask for some Benjis? Fuck is you thinkin'?
If a nigga ask me do I need somethin', I get offended, come on
By myself, nigga, I'm independent
Breakin' the law with no codefendant
Go to jail, I get a lesser sentence
No niggas 'round me so ain't no snitchin'
Mansion, I own it
Jewelry, I own it, 'Rari, I own it
I used to beat up the pot, Adrian Broner
Aligator loafer, crocodile hunter
Young nigga I don't need assistance
But I still got an assistant
It's nothin' to go buy a Bentley
Unlike you lil' niggas, pockets on empty
When it come to the guala they callin' me Polomalu (run to the money)
Brokanese niggas still wearin' Prada
You know you broke, you don't think that's a problem
Askin' for money, that's not an option
Fuckin' your bitch then I took her shoppin'
Different color diamonds, Dennis Rodman
If I throw gotti, turn to a goblin


Stop beggin' ho
When she came to the car askin' for the microwave
Prolly fuckin' Falisha
Shout out Debo, he be gettin' a ho for everything
Young Migo my people
Yeah that Rich Homie shit runnin' through everything
Get bust by them people
Interrogation room, boy I swear I can't tell a name
Hundred thousand, bought a new car
Get wrong at the mouth, I'ma break your shit
And let a hundred thousand buy a new mouth
And I'm up any time
Just spent another two hundred thousand dollars on a new loft
Couple thousand, that don't mean you a boss
I got another 500 stashed behind the wall

Weigh it up on the scale and count, slide it
Point 5 'em, I move in silence
I bought it, it wasn't an issue
Nigga I got 50 thousand dollars worth in tennis shoes
You gotta take an L if you want a fuckin' W
I started in a Super 8, I'm trappin' out the W
Mortal Kombat, fatality, I finish you
Niggas gonna hate on you, can you take the ridicule?
Got a hundred thousand dollars stashed up in the intertube
Got my bitches in the kitchen whippin' up a new

Throwin' up cause my diamonds got me sick as fuck
Carlos in the pickup truck, hop out, 2 Glocks, the block is too hot
Make 'em give it up
Ever since I've been in the kitchen whippin'
Niggas wanna know my formula
Actavis sippin', nigga no prescription
I got the chickens, they're finger lickin'

Count up the extras, I'm dabbin'
Eighteen hours land in Moscow, what the hell them niggas doin' in Moscow?
Yung Rich Nation, Migo gang now, havin' international fame now
She don't speak no English, she wanna meet me, her daddy the plug out in Argentina
She try to drink that liquid in the glass, told her ""baby girl, it's not tequila""
In Miami I hit the doughnut in traffic in the Lamborghini two seater
Your ho fly, in town, I take her to the telly, I fuck her one time and I leave her

Hot nigga so I keep me a torch
I will burn a nigga, put that on my lil' boy

Same keys you're here playing on the piano, I got them wrapped up in saran wrap
Got a plug out in Moscow with the act
And don't tell them too much information they rats
Baby bottle, but no Rugrat
Niggas is old hundreds, call them Thunder Cats
Young nigga be dabbin', hittin' the foam with the spatula
Dab daddy, pull up, these bitches suck me like Dracula
Diamonds pull up, my jeweler from Canada
You niggas still bubblegum wrapping 'cuz you niggas amateurs (pitiful)
Christian Louboutins, a walking mannequin, my balmains full of blue Benjamins
Don't drink that shit just to be cool, I only sip Actavis 'cuz it's my medicine
They put me on the news, they tryna embarass me
Got the Migos looking like we some terrorists
Taking hits, gotta run with the punches

I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money (you know I hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies 'cause they handout
Asking for some money

Niggas be asking for money, they thinking it's funny, I don't give them nothing (nah)
You niggas ain't bucking and no I ain't fronting
You thinking it's sweet banana clip for monkeys
It's 2015 and my double cup muddy
You laughing right now but don't think shit won't get ugly
Turn 'em into bread and peel back his muffin
You finger-fuck light but that give him no budget
I'm smoking on cookie, the cookie jar musty
Treat the blunt like teddy bears and I stuff it
You turn to a cop when you get guap and cuff it (huh?)
Bitches police nowadays, they gon' buss it
Count that back end again, all about the benjamins
I'm a human being so forgive me if I sin
I done been broke before, I ain't going back no more
I done came this far to fall off the pedestal
I done took a walk and walk up to Texaco
Talk to Chico, finessing him for Regano (for Regano)
You boys so crazy, you cannot cop a whole one, you no friend or foe
The monts in my pocket sloppy joe
Christian Louboutin Spikes on my tippy toes
Break the wall like my name is Chris Jericho
Niggas my shooters have 
Jump off the top like I'm Eddie Guerrero
My niggas they ride around selling marshmallows
Nowadays niggas call me Marshawn Lynch the way I got the Seahawks flying from Seattle (Marshawn)
Stuck in the Atlantic ocean canoe but a nigga got no pad to paddle
Stay away from the snakes and you can hear them come by the way that they rattle

When I woke up this morning, yeah, I told myself I had to get some money
(Aye, man, I had this crazy ass dream last night)
I cannot hang with you jabronis 'cause you know that is not making me no money (c'mon, man, you know I can't hang with that broke shit)
I had to cut that bitch off, god damn, all she wanted was some money (you know I hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies 'cause they handout

Scooby & Shaggy,Still On Lock,2015.0,"I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Finessing the plug with accuracy, now he after me
Got 100 Ps in the Sprinter, nigga no athlete
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Meet the plug at the KFC and I finesse his ass after dinner
Call me Quavo the Godzilla
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
Diamonds thrill her in Manila
Fuck her from the back, I’m facing a pillar
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Mirror mirror, got a riddle for you fuck niggas
What if you get in a pickle?
If you catch a body would you tell on your peer?
If you hold it down, keep it 100, you real
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
I trap out the mansion on Beverly Hill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
I know that this money a blessing
I’m thanking the lord when I kneel
We the only niggas in the city having seals
Naw, for real!

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package

Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I’m thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
You acting like you really tough but you soft in the heart, you a diamond
Young nigga hopped off the porch, I was anxious
Just a young nigga old niggas embraced
Juug and finesse a nigga on my faith
Keep a little grip on my pistol, say my grace
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Whipping the dummy, this what I create
I fuck your bitch while you take her on dates
Nobody know I smash her on my lake
Talking fast to the plug, juuged him for 8
Stacking bricks, LA Clippers, call me Blake
Thanking the lord for my situation
Used to have bricks on the intersection
Sipping Act, daily medication
Who really real in investigations
You gonna tell because what you facing
He got out of jail and they couldn’t trace it
It’s a mystery, can’t even solve the case
Don’t be that nigga put on a plate

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically
Finessing with accuracy, abracadabra it’s magically

Finesse him with accuracy
Running with the work, police tryna tackle me
Short days, long nights, trapping at the Quality Control factory
Abracadabra, work disappear magically
I’m in the kitchen whipping, it’s a tragedy
Whipping the masterpiece, then I go smoke on my balcony
My niggas and family count on me
Trapping that snow white in that van, they calling me ice cream man
I see trash bags but no trash, nigga I’m the trash bag man
I see red and white blue lights, undercover lurking in the Sedan
Start with a cutie, break it down
Bag it up, wrap it up, that was the plan
Now I’m pitching soft and curveballs
Or I can pitch it to you underhand
Remember trapping out of Camrys
Until we won Grammys
Now you niggas cannot step on my property or my grass, feel like I’m Stanley
I took his bitch, he mad at me
Fuck em fuck em, pull up on him in the alley

I took his bitch, he mad at me
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy

Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions

Takin' back the streets you know I own
Trap and cap when momma ain't at home
When she cook up the dope call it Nia Long
Kickin' dough was my specialty
Mama told me she gon' get at me
But I was worried 'bout the police
Runnin' from 12 in a Gucci fleece
It's a great feeling that they notice me
Came from bando to mansion to TV screen
No more trappin' no more ReNeNe
Now it's double XL Migo magazine
Don't get me wrong, I keep the magazine
Now I'm the last don, shout out to Master P
I pray to lord, devil don't tackle me
What a great feelin' million dollar me

Water whippin' chickens, all these cameras in the kitchen
Breakin' in the mitten, my nigga was sellin' Whitney
Niggas come and get it cause I got a lower ticket
What a fucking feeling giving money to the children
Bentley Mulsanne pulling up in project buildings
Break niggas neck, walkin' in the chinchilla
My Giuessepe steppers same ones in thriller
These niggas they hate me, but they can't defeat me, I know why they envy me
What a feeling, how I got a hundred million all in cash and you niggas just look at me
VVSing for from my jeweler out in Cuba
I see fugazi diamonds on your Cuban link, 100,000, money nigga ain't nothin' to me
Take that bitch make her work for me, wanna fuck on the shower pole? Mimi

Drop the top like I'm a samurai
I just wanna a hunna mill
House up on the hill
Sippin' out the seal
Lookin' at the sun rise
I just wanna look like  I'm a champion
I just wanna plug that's a Italian
I just wanna live better than average
I just wanna (x3)
I just wanna live up in the penthouse
I just want two bitches and they give me mouth
I just wanna make it out this motherfucking trap house
I just wanna (x3)

1991 I was established
Momma told me stop trapping and capping
Boy you talented
I did not listen so I ended up with the savages
Stuck in the county couldn't do nothing it was tragedy
I just wanna look like I'm the president
In the trap everyday man I had perfect attendance
All of the re up money I fucked up and I spent it
When I told my momma that we gon' be rich, nigga I meant it
I just wanna live like I'm a bachelor
Got the chef in the kitchen cooking up caviar
Doing hundred in the rari screaming fuck the law
Got the chopper aiming at you with the monkey balls
If I don't got the actavis then it's withdrawl
Got the pussy nigga missing like a sick call
I just wanna be on top and never ever fall
Up and downs in the trap like a see-saw
Trap, trapping out the gym without a basketball
I just want millions of dollars and partners that shoot you like shottas
I got two bitches they fucking and swallow
Don't love them just swap them


I just wanna be what I wanna be
Got two lambo seats in the old school topless T
Cruising like Penelope
I grew up on the westside of avenue
You can ask everyone about me
Game in a knot like a tennis shoe
What you gonna do when the feds run into you
I came from trying on clothes in the fitting room
To locking the doors in the Bentley coupe
If my bro drop the pack, then you know I got it
The coupe got the gadgets its like robotics
Giuseppe Zanotti it mark my body
Young rich nigga still walking round with the profit
Tell you a story about one little bird
One little bird when the pecking on the curb
Did he get up, did he fly like a real bird
Over the sea with the white like young Spielberg
30 pointer, 40 pointer
Look at the Franck Muller
Walk in your city
I feel like a king
I am the ruler
(pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew)
Who is the shooter
My niggas be trap off the calculator like computer

Long story short, workin' my wrist and I'm breaking the fort
Keepin' my babies, I never abort
Juugin', finessin' the game like a sport

Talk More Than Bitches,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Huh? He saying what? He said that for real? Ha Ha. Oh yeah, he said that too? Damn

These niggas talk more than bitches (x8)

These niggas talk more than bitches
They tryna clock a nigga dollars
They tryna see if you a baller
Check the tag on your collar
Instead of hating on the next man
You need to try to be the best man
I think you got it from your girlfriend
Talking about bitches contagious man
You talking about Keisha
Really you acting like Keisha
You don't run it up you a runner
You grown but you live with your momma
All of y'all niggas be talking
And can't even pull out a hundred
All of y'all niggas jabroni
They phony they can't even keep it a hundred
My niggas came from nothing
They go to the bando and get them a bundle
Talking ass nigga you pussy
When I was 16 I trap out a onion
We put our stripes in the hood
Migos on the north, you know that we run it
These niggas talk more than Oprah
They telling the feds who done it


These niggas talk more than bitches
Go pissy fits niggas be bitching
You singing to 12, you be snitching
Dope on your nose niggas calling you Whitney (Houston)
Quit the watching nigga pockets
Watching to see what he pull out his wallet
Look like you plotting my nigga
That's how you get hit with that pocket rocket
My niggas Aretha we got respect
Your niggas talk sweet on the internet
I know that you really getting finger fucked
But my nigga we not 'gone speak on that
Your CEO gay, need to see 'bout that
My neck got more gold than a treasure chest
You know that I'm having this manifest
I'm my brother's keeper no Malcolm X
These niggas talk more than these bitches
Wear panties and leggings
I'm laughing and giggling
These niggas they shopping at Tiffany's
In the city they Victoria's Secreting
Your money short like a Pilgrim
Niggas talk like Wendy Williams
Rest in peace to the late Robin Williams

You want my dab, it cost a fortune
Never in a drought
That's 'cuz  I trap with them boards on the house
(And I'm havin'!) choppas under the mansion
(And I'm havin'!) money under the couch
When I make a play, they in and out
Walk in my trap hold yo' snout
When you wanna purchase get a large amount
Lotta millions all in my account
I do this shit for all of my rounds
Real niggas gonna keep it 100, real niggas gonna hold you down

Thank God I just pulled up in the drop top

Fuck 12, tell them niggas free Offset
I was broke, now I'm walkin' with a dumb check
Bought ya bitch some Chanel, she was upset
And you know I don't fuck with the police
Fuck nigga, you don't really know me
One shot to the head and it's ov
In the trap and I started wit' a QP
One time, tell them niggas free Mango
Me and Martin hit a lick on the kickdoor
bando
On the phone wit' the plug, he in Tokyo
Had to come up, so I stayed down
Me and Offset roll one pound
I was in the trap wit' the block hot
Had to serve a fuck nigga re-rock
One shot, Imma hit you wit' the beam on it
Turn your bitch over, Imma skeet on it
I hit her one time and I beat on it
She come home to you and you eat on it!

Neighborhood Scientists,Back to the Bando,2015.0,"No Limit soldier like Master P, all of my niggas they bout it

Experiment with all the drugs, I'm your neighborhood scientist
Experiment with all the drugs, I am your neighborhood scientist

Might pull up, a Maybach or Audi
My diamonds fighting Ronda Rousey
I'm sipping, I'm drinking, I'm drowsy (Wake me up, wake me up, wake me up, drank)
I'm your neighborhood scientist, free my niggas in confinement, independent never signing(QC!)
Look at my dab that's a fool, 2k15 are my shoes
Bad bitches by the double, I just want one of the two
And I got propane in the booth, I spit that flame when I shoot
And I used to juug off the IPhones, and I used to trap off the boost
I used to kick in them doors for nothing, now all the hoes they want me for something
I got the formula whip it up, whip it up like I'm Professor Klump
My niggas? Got em out the slums
Pass a hundred to the bums
Living life like Donald Trump
Gave 100,000 to my mom


Experimenting with the nonsense, I am your neighborhood scientist
 You might get slapped with the pistol, now I'm on the run they can't find me
Sent the shocker, junkies testing my dope, then get operated by the doctor
You need to stop flexing, I see right through you like a glass, I know that you's a impostor
Creep up in a helicopter with the chopper, he turning the block and wait for him then pop him
Plug said a extra hundred if I drop him, you know what that mean, they gone talk cuz I offed him
No Limit soldier like Master P, my niggas bout it, they taking em all for no bounty
(Aye, aye) Pull up in a Bentley with the windows tinted, smoking cookies on top of the mountain (Gas!)
I am your neighborhood drug dealer, ain't talking soap when I say I got Dove nigga
You the type of nigga drinking liquor, and I rather sip lean, I'm a mud sipper
 I won't budge nigga, since my first fund I could spend on drugs nigga
I finessed Aladdin for a rug nigga, since I met the socket I been the plug nigga (Naw Forreal)",https://genius.com/Migos-neighborhood-scientists-lyrics

Young nigga walkin' with the Louis on the beanie
Got to keep the ratchet cause a young nigga schemin'
Had to pull the Lam out, shawty ain't believe me

Lambo doors, she ain't ever seen before
Top floor in condos, pull up wearin' red rose gold
Pourin' lean by the 4, bad bitches at my show
Turn up, turn up, turn up every time you see the Migos
Lambo doors, she ain't ever seen before
Top floor in condos, pull up wearin' red rose gold
Pourin' lean by the 4, bad bitches at my show
Turn up, turn up, turn up every time you see the Migos

Oh she bad, but I don't need her
Drop my top, I got Mazi fever
What's that in your long, bad blunt? I'm smokin' on Keisha
What's that in your bottle? Sippin' on lean by the liter
God damn Quavo, you movin' too slow, what the lean go for?
We can chop it up in the bando, I ship the pack anywhere they wanna go
Top floor coolin' in the condo, look out, see the ocean view
Make y'all niggas watch this movie, young nigga actin' like Tom Cruise
I got Louis V on my shoes, I got your mortgage in my jewels
I got a Corvette in my jeans, you broke, you don't know what that means
I'm just a young nigga gettin' trap money, invest it into the rap money
Back then, shawty you were actin' funny, I'ma still smash, you ain't gettin' nothin'

Lambo doors, she ain't ever seen before
Top floor in condos, pull up wearin' red rose gold
Pourin' lean by the 4, bad bitches at my show
Turn up, turn up, turn up every time you see the Migos
Lambo doors, she ain't ever seen before

Man I'm tired of selling bricks
Gotta know how I'm tired of hittin' licks
Can't wait 'til I sign that deal
The trap life, I'll give it up quick
Listen up, nigga speaking real shit
Cause it ain't all what it seems
You can have it all at one time, then end up losing everything
And I put that shit on my mom
Imma make it out of the slums
Imma get her in a mansion, in a penthouse, living lavish
We at the top floor of the condo
We ain't never got to worry about the popo
We eating on shrimp and gumbo
We smoking on blunts, they jumbo
I got J's at the front door
I serve them up with that combo
Got birds flying like Dumbo, but I keep a 9 like Rondo
I locked the game, I got the code
Cash coming fast that pronto
Making plays, Tony Romo
Two bad bitches, they homo

Popeyes,  chicken with them biscuits
Fuck an iPhone, trapping off a Tracfone
Give the Feds , they can't even track the phone

Ride through the city in a coupe 
Overseas with Muhammad 
Got a date with the money and the kush is my cologne
Sippin' on lean out two Styrofoam
I finesse a nigga for that cash in the red zone
You ain't never ever live the trap life nigga
You don't know nothing bout the rap life nigga
Hell nah I don't want to swap it out with you
Cause you don't even know what you taking bout nigga
I don't know you but I know you're not my crew
But a nigga never ever got gwap with you nigga
You ain't got cash, you ain't never ever sold drugs
You ain't never chop it up with the plug
You ain't never roll down 85 with a hundred birds in a Lamborghini truck
When I'm filthy rich thats when I'll give this trap shit up

3 Mics,Streets on Lock 3,2014.0,"I came from mug shots
To posters on the block
Keep our song on replay
Now all we need is 3 Mics and a DJ
3 Mics and a DJ x3

Know 3 young niggas on the North
By name of Quavo, Offset and Takeoff
We mobbing pull up at your house
Squad open the trunk and I pull out that sawed off
Cutomuto he gone cut your throat, 
Migos dressed in the cut knock your jaw off
I came from bitches staring at me
Now when they see me they taking their top off
Brazilians, Snow Bunnies, and I like Dominicans
Gold on my Giuseppe Steppers, red on the bottom on my Christian Louboutins
I used to be jugging, finessing, remixing the plug on the island like Gillegan
I gave em a flow, and they stealing it
The block on fire, I can extinguish it


3 mics 3 mics 3 mics nigga that changed my life
Mama she told me get right
No more standing over the stove at night
Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Remember hitting licks in the Honda
Now I'm riding round president tints on a Escalade
Picking hard ball like the Braves
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Breaking the sweat like the 80's
Play with the water like Navy
My niggas really in the field
3 mics we don't need a fucking deal


Back in the day a flamingo 
DJ Ray G playing Bando
That was the number one single
Bitches wanna come and mingle
Zonatti Guiseppe wrapped round my socks
We came along way from mug shots
Ducking and dodging the cops Ray G to me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top
They say when you worth a milli thats a different feeling
Wanna know benji im the definition
3 mics and a DJ shot fired on the freeway
Cooking the dope will get bagged like a replay
Running circles around you squares no relay

My coupe is disabled, QC is the label, got dope on the table
Benjamin Franklins is older than SEGA
Now 100 will get you a plan on the label

You see me ballin' now you finna' rush my nigga

Real niggas made the trap house bump my nigga
That's what I call Trap Funk my nigga
Looking like a young James Brown in the kitchen
We all like Bobby, everybody loves Whitney
Came in the game, can't trust these bitches
But everybody wanna' fall in love with these bitches
Run from on the north, take a hoe and make a million
Make a basic bitch feel like Hillary Clinton
Let's talk about the rapper swagger jagger niggas
Put the powder on my hand so I can smack a nigga
I had powder on my hand before the rapping nigga
On the north turned the bando to a mansion nigga
Million dollar cash in the duffel
Million dollar man got muscle
It's a whole pound in the plastic
Gotta' pay for fore' you snatch it
Grandmama died, momma cried a million times
Pistol Pete died, still cried a million times
Life paid off all these hard ass years
Money don't change, but the money change bills

Hey, it was so hard (life was so hard)
Damn, life was so hard (life was so hard)
It was so hard  (life was so hard)
Fuck, life was so hard (life was so hard)

Life was so hard I prayed to God
Shit weren't good everyday nigga I had it hard
Quit sprinting out the crib running from 12 dropping the cars
I have been through the jungle and forest, came out with no scar
Remember the day at momma house sleep
Quavo woke me up in my sleep
Had one Jordan on his feet
We tripping, looking out for the police
He said not only did I lose my shoe, lost my ID
Take you back about a year ago, trapping it at the bando
Way before niggas begin using the Migos flow
When my pockets was hurting I had to kick a door
Or found a way to get benjamins was the motto
I go to sleep, I was dreaming about hitting the lotto
Wake up in reality, he gotta get every dollar
You told me to give it up, but watch how you gone' follow
Niggas that talking they gone' holla
Brush the dirt off my collar
Get back to the guala
Yea niggas, still jugg season (you forgot)
Errbody' know we got no label (independent nigga)
We came in as young rich niggas
One man down but nobody can replace him (Offset)
I don't fear nobody, only my creator (God)
Ain't no pray to nobody only my savior
I don't fuck with none of you niggas cuz' you fugazy
Life's hard life is whatever you make it

Caught him with a hundred bricks
You a fuckin' snitch
He ask me what that multi is
He never seen it
This nigga just another lick I can feel it
That cocaina flow, I done killed it
You fake robbers want to trap, mind your business

I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I done seen a lot of money with my eyes
I done touched a lot of money with my hands
I've seen a lot

Days Of The Week,Streets On Lock 4,2015.0,"Ah, man
Let me tell y'all my days of the week
Trap shit
Takeoff speaking
Students listen

I got a truck load pulling in, dropping off bricks on Monday
My Breitling cost a nigga mortgage, only wear red rubens on a Tuesday
I fuck up the interstate Wednesday
Feds looking for me Thursday
Pound of that crack and I'm smoking I'm smoking, my plug is Big Worm like it's Friday
Trapper turned rapper, I'm dabbing on camera
Saturday a show in Canada
You know a nigga putting God first
And when I wake up in the morning got to go to church
Now all my hard work get paid off
Got 'bout fifty mansions, twenty lofts
Double Maybach but no Ricky Ross
Niggas copying Cubans links but they really flawed
Nigga used to up in the bottom but now I'm at the top
Whipping and flipping the work, I'm beating the block
I can take a trip Brazil, no passport
I bought the bitch an Aston Martin, she ain't asked for it
Free my nigga jammed up, man I pray for him
Shout out my niggas that be running from the Task Force
12 kicking in the door, better go for it
Usain Bolt, nigga better run for it

These bitches fucking on a young rich nigga, of course
Licking all on my chestnuts, no Morris
Counting all of this money, got a nigga bored
Call a bitch Dora, she tryna explore
I got a lot of M&M's, nigga, that's plural
You niggas wanna be a Migo, give a nigga a tutorial
Bald head jab, looking like it's Morpheus
Running from the tab, trafficking in the opium
Thumb through it, young nigga
Thumb through it, young nigga
Don't forget where you come, you used to be a bum, nigga
You a sideline cheerleader, pom pom, nigga
Talking 'bout you seen it all, then what the fuck you done, nigga?
I did been arrested, a felon, a failure
We run up in your house, we sell the gold, and then we sailing
Everything went great, until a nigga caught a case
I never been to prison, God told me don't make mistakes
We were broker than a motherfucker, son had to shake
I didn't want a fucking job, 'cause your grad used to rake
When it's late, mask on my face, 9 on my waist
If a nigga broke, I beat him with a pistol, Anime

Offset, he gon' beat him with a pistol, Anime (Beat 'em)
Mango the Foo, I'll beat the nigga, Jason face
I was gon' for a minute 'cause a nigga caught a case
Now, I'm finna get M&M'S, don't call me Dr. Dre
All of my niggas, we kicking doors for a long time (Kick door)
We been trapping twenty years, still broke? Wrong grind
Migo Gang is the family, we working at there like the phone line
Trappin' and cappin', shoot up the spot like Columbine
Rappin' and trappin', my niggas living in a mansion
Pull out the camera, my niggas all about the action
The way that we punking, these niggas thinking we were Ashton
Pull out the .44 on a pussy nigga, the magnum
Riding around the city, presidential, it's a Phantom
My plug playing with the white girl, Dakota Fanning
The AR Chopper bullet hit him like Steve Manning
Flipping these niggas like you trying out for gymnastics
I got these bricks in the fender, I might get charged with a trafficking
Mango the Foo, bitch I be fresher than a mannequin
I'm all in Peru, but how my plug is an Italian? (How?)

Ten promoters at my fuckin back end
Got a pint of lean whenever Guapo fly in town
Motherfuck the rap game and industry
The streets they taught me never show no sympathy
I swear I never thought I’d be on MTV
Them M&Ms the only thing that interest me
I know why they envy me


Back then they wasn't fuckin' with me
Now they can’t get enough of me
Now the cameras out and they flashin'
Paparazzi takin' pictures
Young independent niggas ballin like the major league
I think they done caught a disease
I’m allergic to brokanese
Young nigga came from the bottom
To the top I had to grind
I was on the block fore the sunrise

They bust my trap one more time, moving my trap to Geneva
Face card A1 no steak sauce, no passport need no Visa
We fuck up Neiman Marcus, we spend a stack on sneakers
Shoot him in his face, he gonna' wish that he had Jesus

They looking at me cause' they never seen money
Pull up in a Beamer with a onion
All Benjamins, blue hundreds
Came off the porch, I was wrapping mummies
Al Capone, meet the Tommy
Safe house, cross the country
Bugs Bunny got the bando jumping
Straight out the jungle, Giuseppe Jumanji

Hop out the whip and I'm dressed in the latest
I'm talking numbers, I ain't here for conversation
Put some ice on my neck and put some ice on my Bezel
Hop out the whip with the mask like I'm Jason
I walk where I want with that strap on my hip
I got the molly sack I'm good when I dip
I serve you some gas, call that a QuikTrip
Hit a bag for a show nigga, that's a quick flip

Tray 1 got a bankroll
I'm cooking up crack rock casserole
I got your unc in the finger fold
He went from hustling to smoking blow
Now that shit be a damn shame
I got a hit, blame it on cocaine
Cocaine classic, coming out the wrapper
I swear to god Tray1 ain't just rapping

Young nigga go get him
Fuck the club up, fuck everybody with him
Too many bullets, can't miss him
I got a extra 30 shots in my Balmain denims
Whole team got racks
We a solid foundation, we just leave you with the sacks
Your Backwoods ain't fat
And that's a cut pint, nigga that's a motherfucking fact

Migo JerZ
And I'm still on the curb
I'ma jugg his ass if you give me the word
Take poured up so my words real slurred
If you want a point five then you ain't getting served
YRN on my neck for life
North side OG, been earned my stripes
Fuck with the Migos, you gon' pay the price
I'm in the trap with a Backwood, shooting dice

Pop the 4, Trey got that shit out the liter
Sippin on lean but I'm cooking the reefer
Young nigga I got more stripes than Adidas
Smile like a cheetah
Ho from the stables she work at the 
Running 10k for a visa
Fuck her and leave her
I'm a rich nigga, I pull up in creature
Young nigga ball like a preacher

Migo, Lingo
Young nigga stay with the strap
Fuck up my check, I'ma get it right back
My niggas are crazy and that is a fact
Bitches want to hate because of the fame
I never would trust them because they the same
Creeping through the night like Bruce Wayne
My money in my pocket gon' stay the same

Skippa da Flippa's the killer
The trap always gone' need me, I'm the best dealer
Arch your back lil more, now I bet you gone' feel 'er
Dab on a nigga ho in a chinchilla
Old school McGrady, I stay with the Rocket
I got the cannon, make you pop, lock, and drop it
You talk about blue hundreds, that is my topic
You sipping Karo, need to stop it

Gucci bag and its a roller
And it filled up with the doja
Walk past you can smell a loud odor
Got lean in my cup no Foldgers
And I pulled up in a Rover
And I hit hoes like Sammie, no Sosa
No coke - aina, no teaser, take trips, no visa
I make a hurricane, no FEMA
.36 hold it up like a nina
And I pulled up in the beamer
Count Franklins like Aretha
And I got dough, Little Caesars
The block so hot, catch a fever
Already know I got bags filled to the top, no hash
Got beans, got lean, got gas
Niggas better come with that cash
Gucci bag came with the flag
Hell nah I can't front you no bag
Hell yeah I just fucked my team

Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag
Half a bag, whole bag with the price tag
Half a bag, whole bag, half a bag, whole bag

Smoking loud ass gas, make a nigga choke
And I know you smoking mid, I see that brown smoke
Take your bitch to the mall, she walking out with Coach
Now I got her running plays like I am the coach
Hang them on a rope, soldiers trained to go
All my niggas don't move 'til I say so
Niggas trapping out a mansion and a Lambo'
Can't see the troops 'cause they wearing camo

Serve the plug, Meta world peace elbow
And I done done it all, no Shawty Lo
Bricks like Soulja, man, they always on gold
When you see the squad, better act like you know
In the kitchen on the stove with the Marilyn Monroe
Got the hood saying 'Jumping out the bando'
Got the hood saying, ""Jumping out the bando""
Niggas mad acting like they don't know
Bill G put terror in your squad
And I walk around pockets on Fat Joe
Nigga walk around with the deuce deuce
Smoking on fat ass blunts, Bruce Bruce
Riding in the truck with no motherfucking roof
And it got 2 doors would've thought it was a coupe
Hit the gas in my extendo
Hit hard like a nigga smoking Kimbo
And when I sip the lean, lean low like a nigga playing limbo
Pull up in a drop top Lambo'
All the kids, they scream out, ""Bingo""
That bitch who couldn't afford her nigga, taking over like the new world order

Got lil' goons where they gon' stirk ya
Got too bad bitches they diking

Pull up and the line is frightening
I smash these hoes no wife-ing them
Beat the pots and the pans like Ike and them

Give me a Sprite and I'ma drop an eighth
I go bananas, I turn to an ape
Talking behind me, that's a pussy trait
I'm fly as a bitch but I don't got a cape

Straps in my jeans but I ain't talkin' Girbauds
Box of cocaine on a tractor trailer

Terminate you like the Terminator

My bitch don't speak no English, my plug don't talk on the phone

I had to wrap the bands on up, I had to wrap the pack on up
I pour codeine in a double cup, 2 black 1 white like it double stuffed
I'm the first play winner you a runner up, Got bands on me like a brink truck
Now I got yo' bitch in the condo, and she laying their with her knees up
Every time I walk out the jeweler its a freezer
Every time I cash out I got to walk around with that Nina
You walk around with that cake on you
Got a watch out for them people who hate on you
Might pull up in a drop top coupe
With a foreign bad bitch from Honolu
Honoluu Hawaii for the local nigga that don't know

Put LV on my loafers, chop it up with the poor like Oprah
Snotty baby no stroller, in the VIP standing on the sofa's
Young Takeoff God got big bankrolls, call me Santa Clause i got ho-ho-hoes
Ten bands for my bracelet, eight bands and them dudes start fighting
Trap booming like I'm doing , strike a nigga ass like lighting
Exotic bitch named Mandy got her on the zannie's
2012 Bentley Panorama and you know i got them..


Got big ass bankroll on me, made them foreign hoes come want me
Many young niggas wanna clone me, but you gotta know there's only one me
Got 2 bad bitches in the Lambo, I need all my bands like pronto
No cash then it ain't no convo, lookin' for the money where's Waldo?
Sippin lean out the pint, walking around with a bank
I got a bitch come from Spain, I don't even know her name
She just whip up them thangs, I go buy the new chain
Then I hit the lot up, go and cop that new Range
All I wanna do is go run to the money
Run to the money while the money keep coming
Got a bad bitch with me and she come from London
Whippin' up a brick and we smokin' out an onion

TRU Religion jeans make her think that I'm buddha

Sat me down asked me you gonna talk or not
No arguing, fussin', discussion
I do not know nothing I haven't see nothin' (no!)
And the Mulsanne parked in the driveway
Nobody thought I would be back here in it
When I pull up I'm lookin in dey face

My trap ain't never gonna run out, unless it is a money drought
And there ain't no need for a bank account
I got bands in the floor at Grandma house
Call the plug and he'll send it over
Cause he already know what my money about
Got the J's calling my shit Mike Tyson
One hit and it'll knock your lights out
The hood calling me president cause I'm trapping out of the White House
The whole hood they praise me, my attitude is cocky
Cause I walk around with that crack rock and everybody call me Rocky
My left pocket is sloppy, my right pocket identical
Quavo just smashed 'em two bad bitches, identical

Now young nigga on top of your ho

Run to the top of the stairs in Philly
I'm feeling like Quavo, Meek Millie
It's level to this shit in my city
The dub, the 100 the 50
Young nigga back then drinking midgets, I did it
Lil (lil) mama used to laugh at me, Now she hitting my phone like please Quavo fuck with me!
Remember that nigga Orlando, Finessed him with Oregano
Rabbit food, Blues clues
Snooze you lose, That's the game fool
Remember when he was on top
In high school, I remember that
Then reality hit and I rolled up with them with my Audi coupe


Rocky Balboa, 
Itallian Stallion
Cruising in my McLaren
Pulling up, Rocky Balboa, my dial, my diamonds are VVSS's
Used to be a underdog, now I'm a big dog
Trapping got gas in the mansion
Take a nigga bitch, Switch-A-Roo the click
Party, Party, Party like Marilyn Manson
PeeWee Longway, I made the name
I changed the game, put dope in her pampers
Give me her address and don't tell her name
This is my life get a clear understanding
Fresh out the banana boat with the dope
Bitch be treating me like I'm the pope
Fly as a bitch form the A, the left coast
Kicking bitch shit I'm Sosa with the loafs

What did you wanna be when you were growing up
A basketball player, a football player or even a rapper?

They dreamed to be trapping
Trapping the nigga out like I'm a Capo, or maybe an Alpha
Cooking dope but I'm no chemist
Adrian all in my kitchen
Molly  you looking like danger
Bob and weave, then hit the canvas

You know what I'm saying living luxury nigga

I bought a Bentley Mulsanne
And I sat it on forgis
Woke up in the morning
Look to my left damn dat bitch gorgeous
Back then when I couldn't wear them Louboutins
I used to wear Jordans
The M-15 I'm grippin', my mansion, Mona Lisa portrait
If you drank too much phizzurp, won't wake up till the morning
Old bricks they rep them blocks I'm talkin' Alonzo Mourning
I might touchdown on a pussy nigga when I'm perfomin'
A show in Paris, Amsterdam, and Belgium they think we was tourin'
Don't need no pistol or no gat when I'm in the booth recordin'
I'm Slick Rick in my streets, I'm tellin' the children them stories
Used to ride Honda Accord now 911 my Porsche
QC the label we the new Death Row my niggas come join
Before that rollie was that Jacobs
Cause I couldn't afford it
I'm just keeping it 100
Niggas lie in their stories
Kim Kardashian bitches beautiful
Diamonds is african
Shippin' and dabbin'
Look like a mannequin
Bitches panicking

I love money I'm passionate
Club packed to capacity
I'm the  your majesty
I'm sippin' lean like a daiquiri
Got the 40 I'm packing it
Your bitch is an animal
Eat the dick like a carnivore
And I pull up Aventador
I'm fuckin' her you kissed the whore
You got money gotta feed the poor
They watching the Migos it's season four
I cannot believe that got me a Jeep and a Porsche
Your bitch in the kitchen she sucking my dick and she tellin' me her knees are sore
I was 15 I jumped out the Porsche
23 got a mansion golf course
Bugatti's, Ferrari smoking exotic while I'm ridin'
I'm molly exotic
My young niggas catchin' bodies
 society when you live in poverty
I didn't had no priority
Now I got me a property
I'm just making it obvious
You hated me previous
You lovin' the millions

She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it

I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothafuckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got my fingers sore
I'm rollin' up a 3-5 blunt look like a core
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid

I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it

I'm goin' through it, my niggas in the slammer
I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin' nothing but tickets
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley

I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it

I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like ""Fuck your master""
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond

I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we win",https://genius.com/Migos-goin-through-it-lyrics

Pounds, pounds on me like the king of England

Quavo, Quavo, Quavo
Pull up and I got the pounds
King of England, diamonds under my pinky
Fuck is you thinkin'?!
My niggas, they keep the extension
Car's not rented
Young nigga, I cash out on Bentleys
Get to the door, the 50s the 100
I'm watchin' you scraping up pennies
Chasing the reggie like 
In Venus, yo bitch, she suckin' my penis
(Pow pow pow) Watchin' you skeezin'
You a fuck nigga and I mean it
Got pounds, king of England


King of England, you niggas rookies
I am a veteran, smokin' on clickers
 flexin', but I'm not wrestlin'
Yo bitch, she textin', my bitch the queen of England
Elizabith II, my nigga, we're droppin' the pound
The Nino Brown, and he got arrested
I'm laughing at niggas, Chris Rock
I walk around on the block
I got the molly santana, you take a rock, you jungle 
I'm whippin' that dope, no miracle
Hop out that limo, pull out the red carpet
Like 80 Coming To America
Plottin' on me is hysterical


El Chapo Jr
I got pounds, pull up in yo town, choppa hundred rounds
Goin' down, betta ask around
(Foolie you really be trappin'?)
Bitch, I'm makin' it happen
Got pictures outta the condo
Foolie the Prince, makin' a call to my Migos
He pullin' up pronto
Bitches they paying my rent
Migo west 700
Taking a trip and we landing in England
Bitches they black and white, lookin' like penguins
Trappin' alound in London, trappin' on more in London
Niggas, they skeezin' we beef for no reason
I throw a skimask when we ain't even skiing

Story of a Snake,Juug Season,2011.0,"I see about time I need to cut my grass real real real low
Too many snakes in my grass, I don't, I don't, I don't fuck with that

Gotta keep my glass cut low for them snakes

Let me tell you bout snakes
Had connects from overseas shipping work from oversea
Had a daughter, and a son, and a wife named Marie
Baddest bitch I ever seen, ass fat as Cherokee
George partner named Michael knew him since he was in diapers
They been getting money for years
Juugin', selling Betty Crocker
Just one night George leave hit a lick for a millie
Michael laughing grinning with him
George don't know Mike thinking about hitting him
In five minutes he gon' be dozin' off he gon be slippin' as fuck
Michael did a line to snort
George eyes shut
Michael slipped something in George's cup
That fucked his memory up
Gotta keep my grass cut low for them snakes
Cut em, cut em, cut em, snakes
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Yo grass tall you can't see no mo
Gotta keep my grass cut low
Low low low

Gotta keep my glass cut low for them snakes

Coolin,Juug Season,2011.0,"Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'

Microwave it, watch it cool, bake it up
Me and BMG we always flexed up

When it comes to them bands I need mine off top
Then I go to the dealer then I cop a new drop
Nigga the watch you can't see the time because of big rocks
Get the money make it flip and stretch it out like botox
Now my pockets lookin' fat like Norbit
Bitch watchin' me you need a camera to record me
Too much money on me they just put me on the fortune list
Your bitch choosin' me now she cumming that's unfortunate

I'm ballin' on niggas just like a clipper
Your bitch in the gang, let her blow the whistle
The gang got choppas all in the Sprinter

She wanted steak, got the chicken dinner
You got it? Then show the cash (racks)
The money come fast, just like the dash
So I gotta blow the bag (what?)

Bust it open, then wait up, tell m, work out, then re-up

My diamonds sparkling, I be like the sargent
Pull up in the Astin Martin, leave in a Burperry carpet
Migo the label, but no no playing with paper
My shirt tiger striped, my shoes aligater
With the plug, never see it
Wip them chickens and pidgens, cokina and midgets, touch it, I flip it

I remembered in school, teacher talkin bout history
I was tryna make history, up in that house in Beverly
I just called my jeweller, tell him bring me my rolly
In that muscle car, 12 pull me over for flexin

I got sweet and sour chicken, lemon, go get me some beef
I got soldiers in the streets, I'm commander and chief
When the Js hit the dope, I bet those nose bleed
I got a plug from Mixico, and one plug that’s chinese
Bad bitch on my team, do whatever I please
Thick thais, brown eyes, she finesse you with eze
Think the jeweller got me sick, a chew, I sneez
Someone get me a key, I'll just rest in peace
Last nigga try to jump, left him deceased
Then we dumped him in the river, body still won't be seen

I’m a cool individual, selling dope, that's my principle
Young like the siminals, baking soda a chemical
I done made it out vakent, had to lie on David
Keep the pistol like Peet, and keep the knife like I'm Jason
I ain't Gigga for nothing, tell m fishing for money
Gotta bumblebee building, me and my crew, that's some hundreds
Took the truck to Bahamas, pick the plug up from London
I be sellin so many fishes, call me Offset Benny Hanna
And the 9 is my ratchet, trappin and stampin on matress

Make you believe in Santa Claus, Santa's sack is on us
I know that they hate that I came off a bag
I don't have to boast or brag just look at the cash
Nigga don't make me mad
That's why I had to put extensions in all of my mags
All of my life young nigga would get into something
Young nigga came up off of nothing
Now I got to learn the different lingo taking private jets across the country
You niggas still waiting on your momma
Somebody shine the lights upon them

Young nigga trapping bags
On the block with Cam running from the fucking tag
Robbing the goon old man
Hop in the jag, young nigga hit the dash
One thing about the migo line nigga know we living fast
Whole lot of cash, OG cash bag in the Jag ain't gotta dash
Walk in the mall, nigga don't check the price tag just throw it in the bag
Ain't tryna  the ticket don't come at all if you ain't got the cash
Make a play get the cash right back so fast like flash
Fuck it up and take it rodeo yo' ass

I done been running from the cops
Got the dope, all up in my sock
And the J's always wanna knock
When they come knocking at my door
'Bout 3 or 4 o'clock in the mornin'
They be asking, they be itching for the dope
They be asking, they be asking for my coke
Wanna pop a bean, wanna smoke?
Nigga tell me what you'd do for the dope
Kick doors, rob a store, and a nigga gonna give him point four
I pull out, Maserati, smelling like that kush cologne
Waiting on big bruh to come home, counting up checks while I'm getting dome
Sipping on lean, out the Styrofoam
Got an extendo filled up with strong
I just fucked up a check, I'm about to get it back
Bout to bounce back like ping-pong

Went to sleep today off the Act
Gassed up but I ain't got cataracts
In the strip club fuck a pussy stat
Hit the block then I fuck up them bags
Hit the lot, drop a sac on a Jag
Then drop another sac for the stash
I don't want to talk 'less it's 'bout cash
Got a foreign bitch and she love to pop Xan's
Drop a sac, put it in the trash can
Good pack smelling like the trash can
These 12 be looking for the work
Disappear I clear my hands
Then I pull of in a Range Rover
Trying to sack up with my nigga Sosa
No triple-A, yeah the game over
I know niggas that bite like a Cobra
Wrap the pack up, ship it overseas

Kickin it with the migo, countin up the pesos
Sippin on lean I'm losing my mind , The Lord is giving me plenty of signs
Since a young nigga I'm watching my brother
I'm walkin around and now I got the nine
I don't love the pussy , you niggas is rookie , I'm smokin on cookie my pockets on snookie
Pull up in jags and rovers its over I'm ballin like Lamar odom

Real trap niggas get money ,pick up the phone whenever it's money

Sellin that coco nocolo , the plug it b costa Nostra

Got that pistol tucked in my Gucci belt , work with the water like micheal phelps
Give me the doe need nothing else , fuck signin deals ill sign myself

Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard

I threw the money, told her ""look back at it""
I threw the money, told her ""look back at it""
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you

If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you

If you all about the money, I ain't mad at you
Long as I throw it up, you look back at it
Got me coming back like a crack addict
I take a night off and I'm back at it

Got so high to call mama
So high to call mama

You Better,Rich Shooters,2013,"Million dollar make a nigga move
200 dollars buy a bad bitch, gotta know she goin move
Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move

When the plug make the call, know that I got the ball
Nigga, can you flip it all, can you make Fendy ball
In the streets, I'm a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Sellin rolls, no cornrolls, nigga, I set it off
Gotta have a gass mask cookin in the kitchen, cause I cough
Send that work out to Memfis, so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know you is false
Rick Ross, and the only nigga in the world boss
4 Gs on the Cheavy, ridin old school T talk
When a nigga run up on me, freez him like a free froth
Feelin like a DJ, hit m with the Re Rock
Feelin like a lost nigga, Re Rock on the D Block
Fuckin with the Chi town niggas, out on the old block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on yo block
Nigga jumbo cookin, that's the reason why the stove hot
See money in my dreams, I had a bankroll not

Million dollar make a nigga move
200 dollars buy a bad bitch, gotta know she goin move
Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move

Offset!
I'm a criminal, I gotta move my operation
You don't got the money on time, nigga, what's your ocupation
Put a muzzle on m, we came up with the location
We say we would never complecate it, never fuckin with the envestagation
Lake m, cause them niggas got condinsation
Livin like Big Meech, got a hundred million in my vaces
I got GD in my vessle, hot like a keddle
I could make a hundred thousand dollars with no efert
Wet niggas with me, wipe m up like Bounty
Imma put the tass on the gas, move it out the county
Active got me drowzey, sippin on this Ak to calm me
I got bricks up in the uhall, and got bricks up in the mountains
I'm askin you to count it, nigga, I don't need to count it
You count it, run off with the pack, like animals
Bricks up in the forin, they callin me a siminal
I know how to move m, Michael Jackson, I'm a smooth criminal

Million dollar make a nigga move

Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move

Drinkin on Activis, a hundred K in the pack in the addic
I got the bricks in the cabanit
Work is emaculit, I be trappin and dabbin
On the island, I'm coolin, had to Christian my Louboutins
If there's an intruder in my window, I'm shooting him
Prata, Bermuta, pullin up with them choppers, with the cooling system
Trappin, got half a bag, but don't know what to do with it
Make a milly, make a bitch get loose with it
Sellin out arenas, fuckin up every city, we used to it
Never seen a hundred thousand, cause you niggas new to it
See, that's that life that got us famous, trappin and smokin with them good jamaicans
Black and white Bentley, but I'm not racest
Travlin around the world, to get Benjaman faces
If you ain't talkin about money, then I get agrovated
Get the fuck out my face, if you ant talkin bout Benjaman Franklins
Takeoff takin trips around the nation

Houdini me 
Woosh, pack gone missing 
Huh, huh, huh, gone!

Yea
Fuck nigga I just took the set, I just took the pot
Hit it with the Shaq' attack: slam dunk!
It's nothing but 33 Larry Birds in the trunk
We trappin' and cappin' the top floor
Why the trunk got it smelling like skunk?
Gas, gas, they callin' up 12 he gon' mad
Here take all these pocket rockets bitch
Put him in yo' Birkin bag
What you gon' do at the top floor
Grab the parachute, hit the window
Quavo you trippin' hell naw
I ain't gettin' caught with all this indo


Pack gone missing, I'm no magician
My diamonds they flyin' like Bobby and Whitney
Walking around with a 50
My bitch in the trap naked  no bra and no panties
You mad cause I'm rich
Cuffin' and loving that bitch
We smash and we switch
I pull up to bando with bricks in a Bent'
I stand round the trap like a fence
Finessin' I run with the money
I'm wrappin' and shippin' the dummy, Houdini me
The kitchen I'm mixing them chemicals nigga no chemistry
Rich niggas in Paris they takin' them pictures
She suck it, she swallow, you probably kiss her
Woosh, Pack gone missing, Rich The Kid still finessin'
I'm RICH!


Got so many hoes on my line you think I'm fishing
She might be a girl, turn around that thing gone missing
Her and her start kissing, liquor in here system
Don't be standing near me in the club, go get some bitches
Got a crib without a ceiling when I hit it you gon' feel it
It's my new motto, nigga, anyone can get it
Damn smoking papers, my new crib come with acres
Gettin' cake with just the wave of a hand
You think I had a favor sump'n

I think it's a ghost in the city
I hustle I feel like I'm Nipsy
Patrolling you missing, so where did he go?
Send my young nigga kick through yo' back door (POW!)
As anybody seen the pack lately
They knockin' my door like the candy lady
I don't know what the fuck want these niggas
These niggas be snitchin', bitches want a baby
The pack he gotta go (Fheww!)
Beep, beep! Truck load
Whippin' and cookin' up Anna Nicole
Versace got me travelin' across the globe
Blue money, blue hundreds
The gas smellin' like it's fungus
Woosh, pack gone missing
Ride round the city, 30 round extensions


Shout out to all my connects in the hood I'm finally famous
Shout out Big Sean and I don't mean the rapper that coke made me famous
Woosh, hey, they try to get me for the packs
Woosh, hey, like nigga who the strap (Blam, blam!)
Huh, I had to jump it straight out of the pot I be cookin' the oil
