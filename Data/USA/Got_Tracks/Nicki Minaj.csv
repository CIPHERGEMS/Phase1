Only,The Pinkprint,2014.0,"Yo, I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em and let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate, I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup for a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried  'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons, Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight, I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5 is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two, big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in, like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me, Lance Stephenson

Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint, ayy
[Chorus: Chris Brown & 
Drake

Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, 
treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga; I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""

Lil Wayne

I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said ""tre-way""

Hard to make a song 'bout somethin' other than the money
Two things I'm about it, talkin' blunt and staying blunted
Pretty women, are you here? Are you here right now, huh?
We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change

Man, this a 65 million single sold
I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me

Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate
I'm so heartless, thoughtless, lawless, and flawless

Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill

He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab

A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

They holler at me, but it's you

I tell her, ""Bitch, you crazy, fuck wrong with you?""
And excuse my French, but I'm a long kisser
And then she try to tell me I'm the only one that's hittin'
And I say, ""What about them niggas?"" She say, ""What about them niggas?""
You right, what you doing tonight?
Put on something tight, don't judge me, I get life
She love me like a brother, but fuck me like a husband
Pussy like a oven, too hot to put my tongue in
All I had to do is rub it, the genie out the bottle
Pussy so wet, I'ma need goggles

Mine and who else? She say worry 'bout yourself

I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say ""We did it!""
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint

You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, ""Damn, I fucking miss him""
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite

Won't you let me be your favorite?

Ayo, I just wanna be your first go-to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late-night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell you niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

I just wanna be your favorite

Moment 4 Life,Pink Friday,2010.0,"I fly with the stars in the sky
I am no longer trying to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live, doesn't mean you're alive
Don't worry 'bout me, and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes, I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water, upon a vampire ('Pire)
In this very moment, I'm king
In this very moment, I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring
And I will retire with the crown - yes!
No, I'm not lucky, I'm blessed - yes!
Clap for the heavyweight champ - me!
But I couldn't do it all alone - we!
Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't phase me
Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done, this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just reminds me of
Everything they deprived me of (Kyuh!)
P-p-p-p-put ya drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they can think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home, yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers getting bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch the bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes

Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear

Buy a Heart,The Pinkprint,2014.0,"You should say it right now

But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

Rihmeek, I'ma have to tell the truth if I speak
Unless you want to play, you ain't say this the other day
You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm startin' to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like gettin' back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been
Hang it up; flatscreen
Plasma
""Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,""
 
asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars; sentencin'
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho; punt
Forced trauma; blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fuckin' with
You lil' Fraggle Rock,
 I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie; camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch!
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut!
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain’t finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask ""Why not?"")

The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic

Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumblin', 
I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill; mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck; overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning Eli!!

All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's (High class) meets (White trash)

You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!

Smoke a lot a of weed, like fuck kidneys
Put a dutch in me, got a 40 on me
I don't trust any, and if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting, prayin' God forgive me
You too busy hating, you can't get no paper
Why are y'all so silly? Straight killers
I can call so many, 
I don't love no bitches
But my mom, my sister, my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood, came from Kingston Food
Shorties standing, in the streets with tools
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang, we don't say no names
If you talk to cops, I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station, in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations, in your conversations
Shoot a opposition, with no hesitation
You get my position, then you better take it
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I got old shit, killin' your shit
On a couple tracks I just never played it
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war

The Crying Game,The Pinkprint,2014.0,"Here we go again, it's the game we love
Sheets all over the floor and they laced with drugs
You ain't play your cards right, you had the Ace of Clubs
Hit you with the Ace of Spade, in your face, and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just planning a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans, that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Are you alone? Do you need someone?
Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?
Thousand words don't change a thing
Is it only three? Three words that you're missing?

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game
I could've given everything
Don't wanna let the tears begin
We're back to playing, the crying game

Welcome to the crying game, where you lose your soul
Where it ain't no E-Z Pass, you got to use the toll
Ain't no cruise control, you 'bout to lose control
Ain't no smilin' faces here, we slammin' doors and dishes
Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?
I couldn't breathe, and you ain't even know it
How come you never show it? All this love you speak of
All I want, is to love and be loved (to love and be loved)

I'm losin' a thing I thought I'd win
And I'm coming undone, 'cause the tears don't end

Where did you go? Couldn't see
I was too busy
Could've just said no
Where would you go? I think that I know

You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie?
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap

You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it

I told Baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'

Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn

You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me? What you telling me?
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me

Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you

All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”

I’m like really famous, I got a famous anus
No, not Famous Amos, all this fame is heinous
Lemme, lemme hear that boy, lemme, lemme wear that boy
All this money coming in, but I never share that, boy
No lipstick, no lashes though
But I got a real big ol' ratchet, though
I said dude, yo dude, you packing dough
He said he want a good box like Pacquiao
I said, ""Well, my name Nicki and it’s nice to meet you""
If you really wanna know, I’ll give you my procedure
Got a whole bunch of pretty gang in my clique
And we lookin' for some ballers, alopecia
I hate whack niggas, I should really slap niggas
These niggas trippin' when I put 'em on the map niggas
How you gon' break that? How you gon' fake that?
Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake high
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No, they can’t keep up? They molasses slow
I'm the greatest Queens bitch, with the cashes flow
Looking at me like it’s my fault
Trying to take sneak pictures with they iPhone
I like independent bitches like July 4th
Now that’s what young Harriet died for

I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up
All this booty here mine, I’m a dollar worth a dime
Real bosses stand up, ladies throw your hands up and say
“I know I’m cute, I know I’m fly
You ask me why? 'Cause I’m the shit!”
I’m the shit with no makeup, don’t have to curl my hair up

To keep you from breaking my heart, ooh

Even though I said don’t touch me, I lied, I lied

Can’t let you think that I'ma let the game stall for you
Gotta protect me, you gotta sweat me
You said you thought you was ready and I said ""Let’s see""
But I ain’t mean that, I need some fuckin' proof
'Cause what happens if I fall in love then you cut me loose?
You just a heartbreaker, won’t let you break mine

Who knows? who knows? So, I lied

It, it, it, it, it ain't your spit game, it's your dick game
That got me walkin' 'round ready to wear your big chain
I only argue with him when the Lakers on
Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant
I don't even remember, though I was probably hella bent (let's go, let's go)

I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (yeah, yeah, I'm not livin', oh, yeah)
No, I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (no, no, no, no)
I, I'm not livin' life
I'm not livin' right (oh, yeah, I'm not livin', I'm not livin, ooh)
I'm not livin' if you're not by my side, oh (ooh, baby)

Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood
They start comin' and I start risin'
Must be surprisin', I'm just surmisin'
I win, thrive, soar, higher, higher, higher, more fire

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

Uh, yo, yo
Everybody wanna try to box me in
Suffocatin' every time it locks me in
Paintin' their own pictures then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no muthafuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanye's

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly

Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it, get ready for it, get ready for it

I came to win, to fight, to conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive, to prosper, to rise
To fly, to fly",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-fly-lyrics

Champion,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,2012.0,"This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is meditation, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don’t let me hit up Shawn Carter, hundred bottles of the Ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, hundred cases to my place, let's celebrate

It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)

What up, Nicki? It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
'Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after

Uh, uh, yo, he the type to pop tags and be cockin' the brim
Might breeze through The Ave, might stop at the gym
And he keep a do-rag, keep the wave on swim
W-w-waves on swim so they hate on him
Anyway, I think I met him sometime before
In a different life or where I record
I mean he was Adam, I think I was Eve
But my vision ends with the apple on the tree
'S-s-s' on my chest 'cause I'm ready to save him
Ready to give up on anybody that plays him
And I think I love him, I love him just like I raised him
When he call me ""Mama, lil' mama"", I call him ""Baby""

Somehow I understood him when he spoke Thai
Never spoke lies and he never broke fly

Freedom,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up,2012.0,"They'll never thank me for opening doors
But they ain't even thank Jesus when he died on the cross
'Cause your spirit is ungrateful
Bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
My career's been the pinkprint
When I retire, tell 'em think pink
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophecy every thing I do?
But before I continue, let me thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and EI told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I could've went insane
And even now I think, ""Do I really want this fame?""
Let me get up and go, 700 to go overseas for a show
Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
Man, I'm birthing these artists and I'm starting to show

I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here
I feel free, I feel freedom
Why they mad? You should see them
Burn an L 'cause it's crazy in here
Crazy in here, crazy in here

Who I wanna work with? Nobody! 99% of them is nobody
Bitches acting like they killing shit, OK
When I check these bitches guns, no bodies
These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
Niggas spend they last dime to say the copped the soonest
Why these niggas going broke to get your approval?
Pretty soon, they'll be back up on them Ramen Noodles
B-B-B-bible, Queen is the title
And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
And if you in the club, then it's a Young Money recital
I'm just that vital, I'm busy, never idle
I'm ya idol, I'm ya idol, I'm ya mothafuckin' idol
Pink Friday in Macy's, thongs and some pasties

12 milli to kick my feet up, get ready this is the Re-up

But you bitches ain't got it, where the fuck is your budgets?
Flyin' spurs for hers, mean I'm fuckin' above it
And I just got the ghost, and I'm calling it Casper
But this shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I styling? I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waiting, 'cause them pictures will sell
Now don't you feel a-stupid, yeah, that's egg on yo' face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face

We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me

I'm just a bad bitch, I'm sorry I put you through that
I'm from New York where we’ll never say, ""Good morning""
Rippin' the block and he ain't come home 'til the morning
I always prayed to have a building with a doorman
Now I'm so busy I gotta turn down these endorsements
Now I'm flauntin' everything that I wanted
Remember a time when I couldn't even afford it
Now I'm in stores, I get everything that fits me
Chanel mink slides and shades so they don't know it's me

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

Uh, I'm still the same bitch from the city of the potholes
She say, ""Oh, I got those"", I said, ""No, it's not those""
I don't fuck with birds but you bitches on my cock though
If I want some chicken and waffles I go to Roscoe's
Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer
Fuckin' with my baby, I'm a gunna
When I say baby, I ain't talkin' 'bout Stunna
I'm talking 'bout lil' like Weezy on the come-up (Uh)

Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag soon as I get paid
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray
Drip too hard, got his dick too hard
He gon' fuck around and drown
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes
Buy another bag
Bad little vibe, keep her by my side
'Case a dirty bitch gotta catch this fade
Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray (Yeah)
(And we pray)

Couple new blessings every time we pray
Every time we pray
Couple new blessings every time we pray",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-barbie-drip-lyrics

I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
Feels like I’m–

How could it be, little me
Had the power to be the best B, in the league
Yeah, inevitably, but could it be little me?
You was heckling me, now it’s monotony winning regularly, yo
I catch rec on recreation, so I exceed all your expectations
Bitches ain't got it in ‘em, I kill ‘em and then I skin ‘em
The contract was signed, but I am the addendum
So-so where my dawgs at, Randy
Ma-ma-matter fact, get off my dick bitch, Andy
Ca-ca-ca-ca-ca-cause everything is fine and dandy
Go against me nooooow, I dare you, Bambi
Half a million dollars just to upgrade the car show
I ain't even detonate the bombs in the arsenal
Before the storm comes the calm
Hope you can take the heat like LeBron
Ahh, ha hahahaha ha
I’m the best now, anybody with some money should invest now
Soccer moms need to organize a pep rall’
Your game over bitch, Gatorade, wet towel
Mothafuckers ain't ready, they neva' been
As long as I am in the game, you’ll never win
I’m on that different type of high, heroin
Put on my cape and hit the sky, heroine!

I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'

This is the moment, grab your Kodak
While I’m flying with a flow that is
The greatest throwback since that Nolan Ryan
And the days been crazy and the nights even wilder
And the lights even brighter, baby, stand next to my fire
Only higher is Messiah or notes from Mariah
‘Rari six hundred horses, that’s my chariot of fire?
Where we flying, they can’t find us all them broke days behind us
I just took your whole life and redesigned it
I think I’m Marc Jacobs, I think I’m Lagerfeld
I think without makeup, you still bad as hell
I'ma grab your waist then, I'ma grab your face and
Then I'ma taste it, then I'ma blaze it
Hello all my bad girls, this just in
Yeezy hurt the beat like he fucked her best friend
And she let him back in, and he just did it again
He crazy, he blazin', he off the deep end
I’m blazin’, I’m flagrant, I'm crazy, I’m saying
Too much for the world so they abbreviate him
His past is her fave, his stats is amaze
Her dress is just per’, uhh, Prada coloured beige
It obvi’ we the ish and I’m rolling with my Brits
So real, you so trill, baby, everything legit
How you feel? They say we crazed 'cause our styles so diff’
They'll be jeal' when we in the mag looking magnif’
As if I ain't used Magnums on your favorite bad bitch
Fuck these background niggas, I was tryna ad-lib
Add this, we blazin', Nicki, what you think?
I got two White Russians, but we also need some drinks

I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'
I fly, I fly high, I’m blazin', I’m blazin', feels like I’m blazin'

Pull up with a lot of baddies, don't forget the Addies

Too much money, I ain't never need a sugar daddy

I think that he popped a molly 'cause look how he sweatin'
I'ma let my niggas rob him as soon as it set in
None of you bum bitches can't sit with me and Gretchen
It's the biggest, a bitch ain't cough one time, it's the sickest

Fast little bitches, but of course I'm the quickest

You should throw a party on the yacht for everybody
If we fuck your shit up, OMG, I'm very sorry

Yes, I bury them when they come for me, call me Halle
Since I finished her, my niggas call me the finale
I'm a busy bitch, I'm filthy rich, no time to Polly
Ayo, swerve to the palace, this the Queen’s like it’s Hollis
Put 15 million dollars, on it, ask LL, I'm doin' it

Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin', passive aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning
Had us running down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason
That I went to school and I finished (yeah)
She told me that I had talent, got on her knees
And prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)
She saw something in me that 'til this day
I don't know if I could be that (yeah)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected

And tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)
Thought I would have a son for you but now it's official
It's over and I can't let you go (oh)
But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like
I'm dying real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt
And when I'm angry (kyuh)
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long, for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meaning of karma

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

Please baby, forgive me, mommy was young
Mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me
I wasn't ready for you
But how the – would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (no)
It's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying
""Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?"" (yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
(More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep – mo-o-o-o)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(Can you hear me? Yeah)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-autobiography-lyrics

But watch all your mileages
Pussy miles go up if you’re talented
I'm all about pool life
Thong in my ass, make that nigga drool like
I'm all about good sex
Fake niggas gotta pay, gotta book sex
Real niggas get the pussy off GP
Real niggas get a feature on my EP
What the fuck you smiling for?
And what they put you on the panel for?
Where you gettin' money from?
Ayo Twist, where you get that Bentley from?
Clap, clap, clap, make it go around like a lap
Now put it in my lap

Couple Bushwick niggas, that'll break your leg
Push you off the balcony, and don't break a ledge
Put your hand up, now it's time to make a pledge

Box spring cost 25k bitch

And nah man, I ain't fuckin' with that Jean Vest
Playtime been over fuck a recess
Playtime been over fuck a seesaw
Bitches wanna play a game? Go and see Saw
That's one, that's two, and that's three four
I'm hungry, who else could I feast off?
You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid
I mean look, your bitch came off an island
I came in the game '09 wilin'

Young Money

If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard

Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you would, what you could
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter, he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south, in the winter
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha) No muzzle
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelie-in' them Kawasakis

From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon bitch, my swagger is punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunovich""
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch

Up in Flames,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded - The Re-Up,2012.0,"We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher

Anyway, lil' nigga don't test the kid
Even Maury Povich couldn't test the kid
Even R. Kelly couldn't touch the kid
And even with all your bars, you couldn't text the kid
I got a pool that I never even swam in
Airports that you bitches never land in
They be like, ""What you doin', Nicki?"" Brandin'
Suck a cockpit, prepare for landing
I'm brandin', I ain't talking about Priestley
I keep a sniper, I ain't talking about Wesley
Why these bitches so pressed, B?
Open my trunk, all I gotta do is press B
I'mma violate y'all asses like Chris Stokes
I'm in Saint-Tropez, on a big boat
Go my way to make a billi like a big goat
Pull my dick out case you bitches get a slick throat

We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter

One last time for us to go higher

Want another round? Well, then get the ref!
Got the clothing line popping, and the wigs is next
When I fly, you know G5 is the jet
I'm the motherfuckin' Queen, 'lizabeth
Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot
Bitches

We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter
We are going up in flames
One last time for us to go higher
We are going up in flames
One more night for us to burn brighter

So I came down and had to pick up my crown
Went to Taiwan and had to pick up my wand
Now everybody wanna pick up my sound
Baddest underground since Harriet Tub
That's why when I come around they hurry and run
And I know it ain't math but I carry the one
Got a couple body guards that'll carry the guns
Yao Ming, I'mma need a couple Asians
Sayonara, bitches, on a Kawasaki blazin'
Ayo, Rihanna, gotta come up off dem bajans

Fresher then a daisy
Used to be on Baisley

Please stop callin' me, I'm such a rock star
Assalam alaikum, where the fuck is Akbar?
Give 'em my keys, tell 'em valet my car
B's pon da wheels, you can see them from far
Now all I need is a real mandingo
Gimme good uhh and distribute my single
Bootleg the mixtape out in Nigeria
Hit up Amadu, he can meet the criteria
If he work da middle like a mohawk, tell'em he can meet me where dem girls say aloha
See I got da first class pussy and he use to give me Coacha
Real good chocha, fuck is my chauffeur?


Ahh, beam me up, Scotty
My wa-wa wine
My wine is too dutty
Beam me up scotty
My wa-ba wine

One, two, buckle my shoe
No one on the corner has swagger like I do
Keep a two-two, get wetter then boo-hoo
Keep a couple stacks inside of my loo-loo
Excuse me, I'm sorry
I got the 45 special, don't worry
Cause I'm cooler than a bloodclaat flurry

It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on the cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choo's just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell them bitches get a stick, I'm done leading the blind
Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money
Yeah, I'm Universal

I hear they comin' for me because the top is lonely

I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best, best, best, best
I'm the best

I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house
You could never understand why I grind like I do
Micaiah and Jelani, why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told them it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'mma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches: I could see your halo

I hear they comin' for me because the top is lonely

What the fuck they gon' say?

Long as you know, long as you know
Long as you motherfuckers know

Marilyn Monroe,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,2012.0,"I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I’m insecure
Yeah, I make mistakes

Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

It's like all the good things
They fall apart, like
Like Marilyn Monroe
Truth is, we mess up 'til we get it right
I don’t wanna end up losing my soul

Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me, I’m worth it
So, take me or leave me (take me or leave me)

Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed

Warning,Playtime is Over,2007.0,"Who the hell is this?
Calling me at 12:47 in the night
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?

Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?

Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker

They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona

Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew
Mami I'm the truth, they salute when I come through
I'm not running bitch, I bust my gun, hold on I hear somebody coming",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-warning-lyrics
Dear Old Nicki,Pink Friday,2010.0,"Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me, ""Where you at?""
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumping off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW everytime you came through
You was the braveheart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me, that I needed to show
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hoped you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is, you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us, when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that

And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
And yes, I'm holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you

I heard she move them thangs,
 
I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know, that I got some more haters with me, might hit up This Is 50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki

Still I rise
, still I fight
Still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize
See my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this
One day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz

Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask

Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi

Beautiful Sinner,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,2012.0,"South Africa is where I come from
Get me my banjo, get me my drum
Kidnap career, and don't take ransom
Don't let me come out of my dungeon
When mi did ah leave then take it down
True say mi come out of England and it done
True say the pattern come from Kingston
Trinidad, Trinidad, my island

I see you in here dancing
Your preview is quite romantic
I envy your perfect kind of life
Who knew you'd be so sexy?
I think you're quite fantastic
Screw your flaws, you're perfect in my eyes

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

I bet you're hard as stone
Living in your world alone
I hope you let me in tonight
They want me to beware
You're dangerous, but I don't care
I can't wait to have you in my arms

And maybe I'm naive for loving you
You're a cheat and a liar
But tonight, you're everything I desire

You beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart
Beautiful sinner
It's such a work of art
I didn't know that bad could look so good
You are the type of bad that feels so good
You beautiful sinner

Maybe you're the master of disguise
And you are puttin' on and you're really the saint, the good one
Are you here to save me from the crowd?
If you are, then baby, take me now

Beautiful sinner
I love your wicked heart

Fire Burns,Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded,2012.0,"You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so, I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that you're blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

Somebody get security to escort us
They go the long way but we take the short cuts
Give me the blonde hair, long weave, short cuts
You know the flow sick, came in on the small bus
So give the D-cup, C-cup, small bust
They judge me like the girl's on trial
But every time that I come out, it's just girls gone wild
Got the domino effect, in the front row passing out
With little bikini tops, they got they asses hanging out
Say my shoe game nuts, so I call ‘em cashews
Every other city, it's another Nicki tattoo
Steal Wayne girls, I steal Drake girls
You know the real bitches love me, fuck the fake girls
So if you pretty, I sign titties

Letter to Lil Wayne,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Dear Wayne, if this shit ever gets to you
Listen to me, there’s some things I should have said to you
First of all, every rapper need to bow to you
As a fan man, I really am proud of you
Second of all, I gotta say thanks
You really did alot for my out of state banks
With that being said, let's get down to the real
I still don’t understand what went down with the deal
And I been waiting on you just to give me the word
You know, a couple nouns and a couple of verbs
I do it for them girls that be flippin' the bird
Tryna get up out the hood and get into the ‘burbs
But everything you said, was it just pretend?
Maybe it was all a game like ESPN
I don’t really care if they hate on you
I be turning down meetings just to wait on you
But what I don’t understand is why you told them you signed me
If you wasn’t ready to get totally behind me
I mean honestly, how could you deny me?
You know you’re Harry and I’ll always be Hermione

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I’m sending ain't making it through to your heart

Dear Wayne, I'm writing another letter 'cause
You never did respond, it's been a couple months
See when I speak I say what people wanna hear
So this will be the last thing that they gonna hear
But this will be the realest shit that I ever wrote
You see me falling, why you never sent down a rope?
I woulda climbed up, but now my times up
I swear to God man, I thought you had it lined up
But if the Lord had a head of thorns
Who am I but a broad with some metaphors?
Knockin' on a set of doors
Knockin' on heaven's doors
Let's play a game, just for pretend
Could we play a game?
Let's act like you coming to me
Like you laced up your shoes, started running to me
And you was running out of breath but you kept going
‘Cause you finally realized what you slept on
If you take your own life are you a sinner?
I made you dinner
But you better be a hell of a sprinter
If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger
I done pulled the trigger
(If you're reading this letter, I done pulled the trigger)

I've been lonely, I've been waiting for you
I'm pretending, and that's all I can do
The love I'm sending ain't making it through to your heart

I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm waiting
Said I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm wait- I'm waiting
I'm waiting
I'm wait- I'm waiting

Materialistic, I'm narcissistic
My shoe game is mean, it's so sadistic
I took a Learjet to cop some lipstick
Yeah, I'ma risk it, I'm optimistic
I sip on Rosé, you sip your Mystic
My flow's a biscuit short of a picnic
Okay, Versace Pythons, Louis aviators
Balenciagas and they gotta be the gladiators
Chanel lambskin, vintage Vanson
I'm on the bike, doin' wheelies in a mansion
A lot of bad bitches, on the pole dancin'
Gucci bag, just to put the coke cans in

Hey, yo, Anna, hey yo Anna Wintour
I'ma need that cover baby girl
It's Pink Friday, ya dig?

Oh no, we don't play with silly girls
All I know is the material girls
Give me the muny, the cars, the Case loads

Give anybody the business, like her's and his'es
Cause my flow tighter than them virgin bitches
You know them asalamalakum, them Persian bitches?
And if you miss me, I'm swervin' sixes
Goddamn, ain't even pregnant, but I'm birthin' bitches
Cause I got flavor, like that girl Deelishis
Stop actin' like you a killer, with all them girly disses, bitches

Just w-w-wait up, I'm processin' all the data
Processin' all the data, p-p-processin' all the haters
You was writin' disses, I was takin' pictures
Signin' autographs for all of my bad bitches
And in the nick of time it just dawned on me
I am Nicki Minaj and it's all on me
But hey, maybe I'll never win, maybe I'm settlin'
Can't let the devil in, I'm a comic book heroine
But when the wind blows, I'm so Marilyn

Yo, write it down, take a picture, bitches, e-mail that
I came to save a thing called female rap
But I hope my ninja powers
Don't fuck around and offend you cowards
You mad at me cause you think I got it easy
If we was in the second grade, then you would tease me
Ya see, you still a lil snotty-nose hood rat
""I love Nicki"" scribbled all over you book bag
I love you too
I just wish your mother would've hugged you too
You know Nicki love the kids
Yellow brick road, lookin' for the Wiz
But when it rains, it pours for real
Def Jam said I'm no Lauryn Hill
Can't rap and sing on the same CD
The public won't get it, they got A.D.D
See Nicki, follow the rules
Go and say your prayers and get ready for school
(Yeah, follow the rules)
(Let me say my prayers and get ready for school)
Dear God, I am only what you made me
And I appreciate everything that you gave me
But like, I don't wanna do it no more
Sort of lost sight of what I'm doin' it for
Thought that I was doin' somethin' good for the game
Until they all started throwin' dirt on my name
Tell Debbie, I really, really tried
That I said I'm sorry, but I had to say goodbye
Tell Fendi, I'll never forget him
And please tell Wayne I'll always be indebted

Pass me the keys to my jeep (truck)
I hit 'em with it, I'ma kill 'em with that wine wine

Later on, I undress ya, couldn't wait to sex ya'
Made a nigga wait so long, but it was special
Light travel faster than sound
Lightning strike one second every point two miles
So when you first saw me emerge from a weed cloud
Electricity touch your soul, that's how I get down
Gangsta love
Completing each other
Touching tongues so close, we could breathe for each other
Untouchable boy with the illustrious girl
But maybe being together's too much for the world, sorry

Freekey Zeke, that should be easy
He just came home, I know he wanna bone
But what about JR Writer, I'mma skill him
And when I r-r-ride him, I'mma grill him
The nigga Pap, he might, could fuck me
But I ain't tryna be drip-drippin' a Gino Green
Tell Stacks to bring the black card up
But if I fuck him would he would he yell squad up!
Tell Rich Boy to send me a pink toy
Throw some d's on it & im might breathe on it

Snatch his big max & slap a bitch silly

Quench his thirst, when my pants come off

Scoop whoever win and, tell him to sca-dattle
Run up on Mims, he could give me backshots

You was buggin' out, yeah, you was peed off
We was just chillin', up at the ski loft
Thinkin' we was on, you tellin' me we off
Your whole vibe changed, when you got that phone call
That's the effect they call a snow ball
Next thing you know, I was runnin' down the hall
Sayin' ""Please come back, I have given my all!""
I have given my all
It's funny, how you could always make me feel small
I have given my all, catch me, catch me, I think I'm gon' fall

Could you catch me? I am waiting on you to catch me (Catch me)

You wanted oh so bad to prove points
But your game always makes me lose points
And your game always makes me concur
And maybe I should have never, taken you from her
But, with all of the aforementioned, I am still trapped in your dimension
So I will be on the mountain waitin', 'cause I am in need, of more attention
Could've called back, just to say somethin'
I'ma fall back in the bass drum
Please come to destination
I'm not doing well, exclamation

Need you desperately, to vindicate me

Ninas on the side of em, goonies on the side of em
Anybody get it boy be careful on the side of them
These niggas'll bury you, guns, no serial
Money hungry honey with me when they holla she gonna carry you
Flyer than a aerial, vehicle, gerital
Sitting on my feet when I'm stuntin on them people
I tell no fables everything tailored
Fax machines, Office Max, see me for that paper
You working with short bread, ain't my money long youngin'
Bitch I'm bout trappin, more digits than a phone number
Different time zones on em, kill them niggas lyrically
Left side of my closet, look invaded by Italy
Right side Paris, left side flagging, paper is my main chick, me and money married
And that's all a nigga know bitch, that's why these brand new niggas on my old shit

That's what I did I came up out the truck you what I'm mean

And I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.

I was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas don't know the fucking half of what I've fucking been through!

Well, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, ""Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next."" You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now you're miserable.

Absolutely. Right. Absolutely.

What you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?

Honestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.
_________________________________________________________________

So, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say you're trying to be something that you're not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and you're doing things for shock value?

Well, I mean, I don't know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, they're going to tell me I can't do that cause another bitch did it.

Stupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.

Everybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, they're gonna fucking stone me.

They're gonna say, ""You're trying to be like Barack's wife. Look at her, she's sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.""

""Why you sitting down and peeing Nicki?""

""Why don't you stand up?""

That happens to everybody, though.

It does.

No, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.

I think when they don't understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.

Absolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though it's very common, it's just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if it's the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and it's a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and that's won than compare me to...

Someone that is washed. That's a natural emotion though... It's easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. That's just the way that it is.
Do you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, ""I did look like a damn fool?""

Yes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

Do you ever think that?

Sometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, ""Damn, she looks like a fool,"" but you're a superstar.
That's how I want to see my superstars. I don't want to see my superstars regular.
_________________________________________________________________

I keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.
I did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldn't really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.
I can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think that's where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasn't. That was a small facet of who I was.
But, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldn't be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesn't understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, what's wrong with that?

You can! Why not?
_________________________________________________________________

Do you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?

They already are. They're already existing together, and they are both winning.

Who do you feel that you lean towards more?

I can't choose. I can't pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind they're the same person.
That's what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.
When I was an office manager I wasn't having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.

It seems like you're very versatile. If it's one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.

Right, because you can't do too much of either. You really can't.
It's unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. It's detrimental for your growth. It's detrimental to your longevity.
At a certain point as a woman -- I'm not talking about as a man because we've seen The Blueprint with Jay. We've seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. That's all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.

I think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesn't exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.

And is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, ""Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when I'm 40 years old rapping. So I'm going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen."" Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?

She's winning!

So these other bitches that only did rap and now they're washed, and they're living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didn't buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!
_________________________________________________________________

When it's all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?

Oh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. I'm gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.
And yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, that's the other thing...

""Look in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that we'll always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...""

Safaree... Safaree...
_________________________________________________________________

Do you have any regrets? Cause you've had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that you've been Nicki Minaj?

I think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.

How can the author of ""I wish I could enjoy this moment for life"" not be here trying to enjoy every moment?

Absolutely. And that's the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.

Pause!

And then all of a sudden it's like, ""Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage I'm just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off it's all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?

Not even that, you closed up the Grammy's.

But that's why, cause she's doing the Super Bowl, and she's thinking about the Grammy's.

And then I'm doing the Grammy's, and I'm thinking about the NBA all-star game. That's the only thing.
I've gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, ""No, no, I'm really good. I'm really happy. I'm really at a peaceful place."" It's almost like they don't believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, ""Are you sure you're ok?"" But I really am. I've never been this happy. I'm so proud of this album. I'm proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. It's a scare tactic.
_________________________________________________________________

What is Nicki Minaj's purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think you're a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, you're a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then you're from New York. There's a lot of rappers from New York that aren't popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.
Being that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, it's like, ""She's obviously here for something."" I think it's a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minaj's purpose?

I have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... I've always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didn't have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, ""We can get free lunch. Oh, we're going to free lunch. This is like dope!"" So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.
But things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didn't really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because I'm looking at them and I'm like ""They'll never get this moment back again, and they'll always remember this time."" How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.
I think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldn't really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.
It's weird because people would never expect me to be so into children's education, but that's real shit. I don't just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.
I feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I don't feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, ""Oh well, we're good now, we're out of high school,"" or ""I got my GED, I'm good."" And I don't want my fans to think like that.
I have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelor's and their Master's saying, ""Look, Nicki, Look."" Because they know how important it is to me. It's OK to have fun (I'mma give you the raunchiest verse sometimes), but I also want you to realize that it's for a time.
One day, you're going to look back and think ""Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I could've been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?""
We got so many girls right now having children and don't even know the first thing to say to a child. But you're having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesn't just happen and that we're smarter than that. We're the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?
Why are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think it's something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until you're 35 or 36 to have children?
Technology has changed – you can wait! Have something to offer them. That's something that's dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like ""I don't have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes."" That's my bigger goal in life.

How do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.
I'm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?

You wanna know what's crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, ""It's so crazy. She's so famous."" If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, it's such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.
The other day we went to a carnival. We thought we'd be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.
She really hasn't changed. She really don't act like, ""I'm this person"" or, ""I'm that person."" She just be there looking so oblivious to what's going on. Sometimes she doesn't even know she's famous like that. It doesn't faze her. She really hasn't changed a bit.
_________________________________________________________________

Pay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?

We said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.

A butt with lyrics

How did you get out of that?

Because I created a brand.
People take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man that's won. It's very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit ain't getting to you, it's draining.
It's crazy! That's why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, ""What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why don't they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are,"" until you get here and you are like, ""Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this?"" And he's like, ""Yep. Now let's see who really want it."" But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people can't deny that...

You the shit. Say it! You don't have to be humble. Be like Ray J. ""I'm tired of being humble.""

I'm not a cocky person by nature.

Scaff, be cocky for her!

Yeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches ain't shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like she's said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!

What!? What would need to be sucked? On you?

Ay. Anything. Anywhere. I'm in these streets looking for work. We're all in these streets, we're looking for that work, that twerk.
_________________________________________________________________

I just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that you're very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that you're gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, ""Damn, hip hop can take you this far!?"" I think you're taking that baton and you're gonna take it even further. So keep doing your thing, Ma.

Thank you, darling.

We tax niggas, no deductible (get it out)
So what it is, what it ain't, nigga state ya name
You know we got them umbrellas if you make it rain
So what you want them good girls or them bad ones?
I got them girls make ya wish you never had none
Cause you'll be spending beaucoup in my spot, shorty
This nigga acting brand new like he just bought it
Up and away like Mighty Mice
You can say I am the rap game Heidi Fleiss
Cause my flow crazy, Hussein like Sadam
You getting it, I got 'em, I'm the rap bitch madam, 
I'm the madam

First I take their order at the Cuchi Shop
Then I send 'em a girl that can make her coochie pop
And then I smuggle all my money through the coochie spot
(Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam)
And there ain't no returns at the Cuchi Shop
We don't wanna hear ""it burns"" at the Cuchi Shop
Just listen and you'll learn at the Cuchi Shop
Up in the Phantom, have you wishing you had 'em, I'm the madam",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-cuchi-shop-lyrics

You can’t stop me, I’ma fulfill my prophecy
I do it, I did it, the proper way
Ah, my property, now watch how we operate
Bottles on ice, the bottles is on ice
The V.I.P lights is hitting us just right
So if you getting money, just throw it up in the air
Your hands in the air, like I was your puppeteer

Some call me Barbie, yes, I’m life-size
Yes, I am humble, yes, but why lie?
I am the reason why these girls go bye-bye!

Okay, now, this right here can get me in trouble
'Cause when I say I ball, I don’t mean in a huddle
I’m always in the lime, I never do nothing subtle
'Cause it’s Pink Friday, ho! That's their rebuttal
My two guns up, let's blaze it, let's go
I keep a lot of money up in the Escrow
And when I’m at the game, I’m in the best row
I am the baddest bitch up in the pet store
'Cause I, I, I, I am Onika
And these shoes here mean fashionista
‘Cause these don’t come out 'til it's Easter

Long as I'mma keep buying designer she's a rider
Scooped her out of that Nissan, threw her in a Hummer truck
Four wheel drive when you ride, you ain't never stuck
Who is he? Could it be? Young Joey, he gotta be
Honestly the hottest 'cause when you shop there ain't no stoppin' me

Look up in the sky, I see somebody on a broom
I think I'm gettin' hi-high-hi-high, on my own supply
Yellin' ""Rasta, alright! "" when I'm ridin' by
See, I used to be the wife, of a king
Back when I was smugglin' them things, in the bing
Now that I'm a boss bitch, it's a win-win
Come to Mr. Chow's, or meet me in Chin-Chin
Now I get'cha ching & my name bells ring -

In a kimono, ""Konichiwa"" to the Asians
I kick, kick, kick it like I'm Bruce Lee's son
So all of that yellin' in the street soon done
Cause if I take my ski mask off, then I'm dumbin'
The young Chaka Khan, yes - ""I Am Every Woman""
And I am 'bout that coke, not what'cha put the rum in
Say a little prayer, tell the Lord that I'm comin' (comin')

Step your cookies up, go get you a ladder

Thank you for comin' out tonight
Ladies and gentlemen
I am the president of Dirty Money Records
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
New York City

Who you know fresher than Nick? Riddle me that
Mami you itty bitty can't mirror me back
Everybody gon' see where I'm lyrically at
Used to hate Nicki, now they givin' me dap
I live and I learn,  but I wait my turn
I'm always on the run, got weight to burn
Ease off the gas, then I make a turn
Three off the pass, they don't play like her
Why I can't just be ill?
Why when they see me, bitches gotta to go ""Ew""?
Why my lil' nigga, still gotta sell krills?
Why I'm this hot and still didn't get a deal?
The rain and the pain, I done paid my dues
I'm ready for the game, I done laced my shoes
Everything I say believe I'm gon' do
Came out the coop, Petite Vuitton boots

Can I get an encore I know you want more
I know you sick of all them girls, they such a bore
But it's my time I need y'all to roar
It's my time I need y'all to  roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)
After me, there shall be no more
It's my time I need y'all to roar
(What the hell are you waiting for?)

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Know when I paid my dues, that I would aim for you
Straight from the streets of Queens and yet it seems
The only thing they know, is that I push a beam
All they see's a pretty face, how I ride the base
So I put my hoodie down just to hide my face
They don't see the tears I cry, the fears I hide
Tend to keep my cares inside, it's merely pride
Like my grandmother, I wonder if she next to pop
Said the next time I seen her she would be in a box
Damn she was right, she was dead right
How was I to know, that would be her last night?
If I could turn back the time
Dear God, somehow could you press rewind?
Won't come when I call, but He just in time
So I come when He call, like I'm next in line
When you got something good why the Devil gotta ruin it?
Guess she never know, I be the best bitch doing it

Tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
Become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb

Can I get an encore
I know you want more
(I've become so numb)
But it's my time I need ya'll to roar
It's my time I need ya'll to roar",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-encore-07-lyrics

While these hoes, stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on tha track, like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like, 'Quille O'Neal
Gassed ya baby father, for the keys to the Escalade
Not a baby momma, but I'm drama like, Kay Slate
What can I say? That's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down, to tha cuticles
My people smoke dutches, we don't fluck with bamboo
I'm a winner mami, ya career's a gamble
Old ass broad, off track, like bad weaves
Nicki stay on her toes, on point, like ballerines
Lemme remind you, I'm gettin' a tan too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from Queens
They say I'm too pretty, to be spittin' sixteens
I should be on the screen, posin' for Maybelline
Or be a Baby Phat girl, kitten on my jean
Hood star broad, Black Barbie Doll
Pardon me, if the cockiness, botherin' y'all
I'm just bein' Nicki Minaj, ya know?
Girl from around way, without the L Cool J
Ma' you spit Kool-Aid, I spit acid out
Doin' this since, you was Reebok, Classic Doubt
Now this ho, wanna get at Nic', why?
Cause I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since
Nic' so gutter, lil' white tee, need some Air Max on
Some Dolce and Gabbana, pretty panties on
Like, wait 'til the summer catch me, up in the hummer
On my way to 555 front, run with the Rucker
And every baller wanna never, give out my number
Only that email, Cherry-thong.com, -
Holla! Name a girl, as real as her
No, not them! Who's your best emcee?

Is it because my flow slicker than petroleum?

You tell me what I know, I guess I must concur

How the only chips you got is Bon Ton potato chips?

Said that I was your all and I believed you
That's why it hurts to the core, I gotta leave you
How could you love me, and humiliate me?
You ain't my man, don't affiliate me
With all your plans cause you really made me
A lil' bitch, when that really ain't me
Mondays was the fun days, from
The slum to the runway, runs in the Hyundai
Niggas didn't have your money, it was gun play
Used to tell me to listen to what a thug say
At night, I would sleep on you
And I guess I did sleep on you
'Cause when they said it, I said ""Creep on who?""
No, not my boo, ain't what he gon' do

Oh, now you wanna be with me, but you can't be with me
Boy, leave me alone, you know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go
If you wanted me in your life, you shoulda treated me right
Boy, leave me alone, you know you did me wrong
So I gotta letcha go

Why you saying you ain't feel her?
You was in the villa, she was in the white chinchilla
You was sippin' on a Miller
My bitch Pam' had the hidden cam, like Killa
Funny how you win some, you lose some
Never worry where your income would come from
'Cause no matter where you was, I held you down
Up north to uptown, so how you sound?
Now you all up in my face, 'bout you make mistakes
If I'd have known you was fake, I'd have laced your steak
Strychnine, one time, in your Welch's Grape (wine)
Quit lying, why you lying? I watched the tape, nigga
Now get up out my dressing room, give me some f'ing room
Go get your mind right, and take it as a lesson learned
Just like Usher, nigga, you gon' have to let it burn
To the left, and I ain't talkin' about Jigga girl

Oh, now you wanna be with me, but you can't be with me

Yo, why the fuck these little bitches always talking shit about what they did and...?
I don't give a fuck, bitch!
Nicki Lewinsky
Look (fucker!)

When you was on stage with your brain on drugs
""Nick-Nack, Carry Crack"", what my nickname was
And when you was in the hood with bottles of OE
I was OT, looking real low-key
I do a striptease if the cops stop me
A pair of Guess jeans and some beef and broccoli
I was at the Rucker,
 I was sippin' on a Smucker's
I was rockin' hats that was made for the truckers
That's when I hopped out the pink on pink
Hate it when a bitch act like her shit don't stink
See you was drippin' wet, you was jumpin' in the crowd
I was in a jet, I was swervin' through a cloud

You know, I'mma put them bitches in a time machine and, and, and, and... send 'em back to the past and shit
Bitches always talking 'bout shit they did and all that
Bitch, get in a time machine!

Time machine bitches always talkin' about the old days
When they was hot, when they was tourin' with the OJ's
I tell a bitch this: ""I'm not impressed, bitch""
I'm Nicki M, trick, I'm always on the guest list
I'm on my way to Riker's Island with a couple hard
I'm on a bike, nine-five-four double R
And they don't write shit, they might write a couple bars
That's why they getting drop-dropped, like a couple cars
(You shouldn't have said that) NY to NO
Late Night shows, like Letterman and Leno
End, where you cut it, home-slice, your gar-bage
White boys tell me that I rock, like guitars

See, see, you see Anna Mae?
I'm about to slap ya'll bitches 'round and call ya'll Anna Mae
Like, that, that's what y'all gon' get in a minute, real talk, like

I was getting money, I ain't care bout them, cause -
They was getting G's, I had M's, I used to -
Split my dividends, with all my friends, cause -
I was in the lounge, they was in the Greyhound, like -
In and out of town,moving coke by the pound, like
Guess it didn't sound right, cause them bitches was mad -
Started plotting, trying to get what I had, see -
My homegirl Teisha, said that Keisha with the  -
Real black lips, used to smoke that reefer, some -
Bitch, named Dawn, used to fuck LaiQwan and
Alicia with the chinky eyes, used to be with freaky Ty
Lived across the street, from this nigga named Tiki Diamond
Yeah, chicken noodle bitches, like a pack of Ramen
They had it out for me, kidnapped my brother
At the rucker, cause he used to put it down for me

Oh my God, they caught Brandon, I got his picture in the mail
He was rocking a Vanson, the note said
""Bitch, we got surveillance on the mansion and we gonna need thirty million for the ransom""

I’m sorry I don’t wanna take a walk with ya
Matter of fact, I ain’t try'na talk to ya
We ain’t got no business, so what we talking for?
There ain’t no need to bring me in for no interrogation
Cause about that boy who just got shot, I gots no information
These broke ass snitch niggas still gram shaving
At the precinct writing statements on which trap house is the station {​DAMN}​
Not I, tattle-telling is for homos
Besides, thats the Number 1 Young Money no-no
Police, we don’t chat with them
We ain’t got no rap for them
You in the cop car pointing niggas out from the back of them {​THERE HE GO}​
Back seat informer, your papi shoulda warned ya
You even tell PoPo I’m black, then you's a fucking goner
Yeah you get high, but I get higher
Manyana, I just might go to the halfway house and ask your supervisor

Yo… 4, 3, 2

Coming down the chimney, you're chopped n' screwed

So excuse my twitches (Excuse me!)
Lemme get that brewski, niggas know them bitches can’t do it like I dooski
I just pull up, chuck the deuce in some blue denim, and I just heard he running with the lieutenant
I’m the mistress, I be in the District of Columbia
Yes uh huh, Washington
Better ask around, cause I’m what's popping-ton
I’m who they think about, playing with they pee pee
Gotta count sheep b, cause I’m never sleepy
Yes, I’m the chief, you can find me in my teepee… BITCHES!
Chorus
Gudda Gudda
Young Money psycho, straitjacket on me
Break a nigga jaw if he turn to informant
I bring it to your door step, loose lips sink ships nigga
So I’mma bring you to the bottom of the ocean 
I hear you preaching like a fucking reverend
Should've killed you in the first place, no second guessing
Could've killed 'em with the first and the second weapon
DJ Unk 'em with the hand, I two-step and deck 'em
Then I grab the choppa, blue flame Houston wreck em
Kick a snitch head through a goal like David Beckham
Make way, respect em
I could AK or tech em
You looking at a gangster in his essence
Now bitch bow down when a gangster in your presence
Cause I’m God’s gift like a present
For one don’t try me I could give you two lessons
You peasants get murdered if you do test 'em

Then I'm a let you eat it, like I put the snacks out
Don't say you can't, say you can, say you can can

He's a banker by nature and he'll call and
Stick up the debt, that you owe and thank ya
He'll switch the toys out, never the same route
But niggas acting, like they ain't about to pay out
Taking me out, just to ask how my day went
Tryna show me, I'm his number one investment
He know what I like, stay on your job type
I'll pop if you can pop like you got rubber bands, we like



Cause we like, bad boys and bad cars
Them hood rich, dope boys and trap stars. 

See I'm a rubber lover
So wrap it and I'll hug ya
Then we can stick together

Bad boys I catch, call me undercover
Street grindin', cold cut mother- (fucker)

Somethin' bout his money, make a nigga handsome

When Wayne walks up on the motherfuckin' set and-and say, ""Don’t talk to me, have my fucking music ready, get the fuck up out of my face, I’mma blow this shit in your fucking face all day, it’s cool. But every time I -- every time I put my foot down and stand up for myself, it’s like, ""We’ve heard about Nicki Minaj! Nicki Minaj shut down a photo shoot! Oh my god! No one wants to work with Nicki Minaj!""
I’m glad you heard. Now, when I come to a photoshoot, let it be of quality. You know why? Because I put quality in what I do. I spend time, and I spend energy, and I spend effort, and I spend everything I have, every fiber of my being to give people quality. So if I turn up to a photoshoot and you had -- you got a fifty dollar clothes budget and some sliced pickles on the motherfucking board, you wanna know what? No, I am gonna leave. Is that wrong? For wanting more for myself? Wanting people to treat me with respect? But you know what? Next time they know better. But I had accepted the pickle juice, I would be drinking pickle juice right now
When I am assertive, I’m a bitch. When a man is assertive, he’s a boss. (He bossed up.) He bossed up! No negative connotation behind ""bossed up."" But lots of negative connotation behind being a bitch
Donald Trump can say, ""You’re fired!"" Let Martha Stewart run her company the same way and be the same way! ""Fuck, oh, evil bitch."" But Donald Trump, he gets to hang out with young pussies and have 50 different wives and just be cool… ""Oh, Donald we love ya. Donald Trump…"" But when you’re a girl, you have to be like… everything. You have to be -- you have to be dope at what you do, but you have to be super sweet, and you have to be sexy, and you have to be this, and you have to be that, and you have to be nice, and you have to… It’s like, I can’t be all those things at once.

We Miss You,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Why’d you have to leave in July
On a peaceful and serene Summer night
I wish that you would've waited until September
Just a couple more memories to remember
I guess I have to pay you back to your lender
I guess I have to send you back to the sender
But then again maybe you're gone til November
And maybe this is just part of the agenda

Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

Why couldn’t you come right home
When you seen the text message in your phone
I should have put my pride aside to come and find you
I could've told you about the niggas that's behind you
Could have told you all about my intuition
I could have even bought the extra ammunition
But now you moved on so fuck you
Should’ve known from day one I couldn’t trust you

Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

Why would they take you from me
Why the doctors couldn't stop the bleeding
If you in a better place, then you’re free
Well then, why can’t they make me believe it
You said that you will leave these streets
And I know you didn’t mean in a body bag
But now you see you not bulletproof
And I’m mad cause
You’re the best that I’ve ever had

Why’d you have to go so soon
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you
We miss you, we miss you, we miss you

Her bags is boss, cause her leather so soft

Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard

With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad

And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her

And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass

Woah, woah
Chasing dreams got me all over the world
Now I’m sitting on top of the world
We winning, we winning
Cause we sitting on top of the world

This is for the little girls that say Nicki you pretty
When you come to the city you don't act high siddity
You be up on the block, posted up in the drop
And everybody get up in, whether you like it or not
But how them girls blow up but don’t come to the hood?
How they turn they nose up like they don’t come from the hood?
Most of them be in sight til it’s time to pitch in
That's why everything they write be a contradiction
I tell em I do it for the love, I do it for the hugs
I do it for the buzz, I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich, I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid that can’t do no more

When I’m granting they wishes they be passing they digits
They be up on the block getting screwed by the cops
Cutting school, gettin knocked whether they like it or not
They’ll break in your door
Might break in your jaw
They’ll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain’t know
They airborne for stardom
With the ball in the Garden, stand tall, no dodgin’
No matter the squadron, lieutenant or sergeant
Air Force, the Army, Air Force and Army
Fatigues is on him, no heats is on him
Cause grandmama prayed, that he’d leave the corner

Cause we sitting on top of the world

I remember when I lost everything in a fire
Now I got fire 23′s on my tire
Shout outs to my brothers, Jelani and Macaiah
Thanks to the Messiah, my money getting higher
One time for my niggas, that be huggin’ the block
Two Times for my niggas, that be ducking the cops
Three Times for my girls that pushing they own rides
Stushing they own ride, bitches they don't lie
Sometimes you get mad, wanna blaze the gun
Look, I see you without a man ma, you raised ya son
Well look, when you blow up everybody go shudder
This goes out to everybody on the come up

Nowadays these rap niggas on some feminine shit
So I guess Queen B gon' be the man of this shit
Laughin' at these rap bitches on some amateur shit
They better off makin' a livin' on some janitor shit
Who the hell is this chick?
She been out kinda long
Had one hot song, I'm sorry I missed it
Too busy being conceited, puttin' on my lipstick
Takin' trips out in Cali, chillin' with the Hiltons
Yeah, I'm chillin', Kim top billin'
With the top down, throwin' money through the ceiling, I get it
The lifestyle you only rap about, I live it
My man buy me cars that you hoes be rentin'
I'm classy like the Phantom, you a Honda Civic
Lil Kim got your whole bank stock, I get it!
Bustin' shots, b-bustin' shots, b-bustin' shots, yeah
See, you can call this the Rem-mix, but it ain't Rem, though
It's Shesus Khryst, I switched up my M.O
The BX savior, gimme that paper
I'm passin' out the collection plates
'Cause I get gully, bust a shot right at your favorite rapper
Really kill hip-hop, see, I'm gettin that guap
Hater, you just a Rem fan
I put haters in trunks and I don't mean swim pants
I talk gun talk and people believe me
But that's how I do it when I do it for TV
Tryna stop my cash flow, I flips on you assholes
My itinerary full, I got mad shows
I'm goin overseas to see R to the Easy
At that currency exchange, I get that Euro easy
And my hair be fresh, my gear be fresh
I got last year, this year, and next, 'cause

I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
M-money I got, M-money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got
I-I get money, money I got (I, I get it)

Get It All,Unreleased Songs,2007,"She said, ""Baby
I know you love her, but I love you""
She caught my face like a Kodak, I couldn't shake the weather
Storm had nothing on this chick named Heather
Damn every time I seen her, it was just the thought of break up
But you know niggas and girls how they quit, then they make up
She told me she been in love with me ever since we were in 6th grade
Ms. Hills' class, I'm just thinkin', ah, oh
Mighty funny didn't notice her back then
But now her body bangin', got me thinkin', ah, oh
I'm just thinkin' I'm so quick to fall
I wanna hit it, but I'm still involved
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend
Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep
She tellin' me to come and get it all, get it all
She so glad the girlfriend that I used to have didn't wanna treat me right
So she told me I could get it all, get it all
Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend
Stop playin' man, I been hotter than summer school
'Cause even then I used to make them motha fuckas drool
I been bad since sticky hands
Now all these bitches is Nicki fans
I gotta chuckle, excuse the duffle
I mean my ring so big it just bruise my knuckle
And I just heard that you was back on the market
Let me stick shift, ride it, back it up, and then park it
'Cause you and me, we should be together
Cop da matchin' Lamborghini, Swahili leather
Now dat dat dat dat's black on black
And if the bitch call ya phone, that's a back hand smack
Nigga what?
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend
Shawty said she had so many dreams of her and me, she couldn't sleep

Best believe me, she gon' get it all, get it all
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend
She freaky, tangerine tone
Body belong on the cover of the 2010 swimsuit issue of SI
She told me to don't leave her until I know I'da got over the whole fever
And I can't stop
Best believe me she gon' get it all
Best believe me she gon' get it all
She said it's just like when you hit a ball
If you gon' swing, you better get it all
She told me that the girl I'm with don't get it
She wanna show me she can be better girlfriend

See money ain’t a thang, 'cause my doe is like woah
Pull out my bank roll on a nigga like ""yo!""
Let’s make some videos, get the Benny Boom crew
I’m hoppin out the Rov in my Jimmy Choo shoe
I’m the boss bitch, you know I like to talk shit
I’m heavy in the streets, so you gon’ need a forklift
And, daddy, lemme cum in your mouth like the dentist
I’m not the apprentice, don’t finish your sentence

Baby, we ain’t gotta talk, we could bone
Soon as we all alone
Then, baby, I’ma get you in the zone

See you’re already thinkin that you must be dreamin
Get them strawberries, bring another whipped cream in
Lemme get ya' cup of patron

I don’t let the microphone hypnotize me no more
Listen, daddy, let me jump on

Ayo, once upon a time, there lived a little bad bitch
I just press the buttons on my little gadgets
Born in December, so I am a Sagittarius
Maybe just a little bi-curious
Yo, miney-mo-to-eenie-meenie
Your wish is my command
I mean I really, really mean it
'Cause I am the lady that was on I Dream of Jeannie
They call it spaghetti but I call it linguini
Coke fizzles if you wanna get the sniffles
I got that wet-wet, it could get wetter than a drizzle
Plus I got plenty, no seeds in my twenty
And I just got them peanut butter crack sandwiches
You need a dopeman, oh, you need a snowman
I got that Lohan, weight like Rosanne
But fuckin' with my money is a no-no, man
I got them Bar-billions, they call me Cole-man

Intro,Beam Me Up Scotty,2009.0,"You know, a lot of people ask me why I feel that, you know, I've gotten a lot of notoriety so quickly
And I don’t know, people seem to be under the impression that I’ve made it to this point fast
And, you know, obviously for me, I don’t feel like that
'Cause it's me, you know? I feel like I’ve been doing it for ten billion years
But every time someone says something like that to me
I remember to just thank God for getting me this far
'Cause sometimes you don’t realize how far you’ve gotten
Until you look around and look at the people who are still trailing so far behind you
And I know that no matter what, in the end, it's not going to be about my talent, you know?
It's not going to be about connections
It’s not gonna be about my looks
It's gonna be about who wants it the most
And I want it the most",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-intro-lyrics

What can I do
And everything protecting me has all been stripped away
Cuz I'm....
Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked
I could try to change
But nothing fits the way that
You do, oh yeah you do
From every strangers eyes you're my best diguise
I need you
I still need you
And everything that comforts me has all been stripped away
Cuz I'm...
Chorus:
Naked without you around
You cover up the emptiness when
I'm filled with doubt and I feel
Naked from the inside out
You always seem to shelter me somehow
When I feel naked
The moments we share are all that I wear
It's colde without you
Now I have to try to get through another night
Cuz I feel...

You cover up the emptiness when

Never Let It Go,Unreleased Songs,2007,"You're trying to tell me you're saying goodbye
I'm watching you leaving not believing my eyes
You'd better be looking over your shoulder
Cause I know too much for this to be over
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it
What once was good is gone like innocence we watched it dying
What once was beautiful is ugly now we just can't hide it, can't hide it
Let it go...
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now
You'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
You'll never let it, let it go...
I always hoped that this would last forever
Just you and me against the world
What once was powerful has weakened now we can't pretend
What once was right is wrong like everything this game must end
Oh baby, the lies and deception
We're gonna bring each other down
You told me all your secrets
This isn't over now
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I'll never let it go, let it go, let it go
I told you all my secrets
This isn't over now

When you come to the city
You don't act hassadiddy
You be all on the block

And everybody get a band
Whether you like it or not
But how you girls blow up

How they turn their nose up
Like they don't come from the hood
Most of them be in sight
'Til it's time for picture
That's why everything
They write be a contradiction
I tell 'em I do it for the love
I do it for the hugs
I do it for the bugs
I do it for the thugs
I do it for the rich
I do it for the poor
I do it for the kid

This is for my lil homies
That be asking for kisses
When I'm granting their wishes
They be passing they digits
Carry up on the block
Getting screwed by the cop
Cutting school, getting off
Whether they like it or not
They'll break in your dough
Might break in your joe
They'll bring back a lot
If you bring them an O
But what you really ain't know
They airborne for start
With the ball in the gutter
They can't turn no dodge
No matter the squadron
Lieutenant or sergent
Air force the army
Air force in army
Four teets is on 'em
No heat is on 'em
'Cause grandmama prayed
That he leave the corner


I remember when I lost
Everything in a fire
And now I got fire
23s on my tire
Shoutout to my brothers
Jelani and Micaiah
Thanks to the Messiah
My money getting higher
One time for my niggas
That be hugging the block
Two times for my niggas
That be ducking the cop
Three times for my girls
That pushing they own ride
Specially they own life
Bitches they don't like
Sometimes you get mad
When I blaze the gun
I see you without a man
May I raise your son

That's why I keep my wrist lookin' like a disco
And everywhere I go they tell me that I'm pretty
My money slow, my money stupid, money ditsy
Mami you bad, but Nicki is badder
Step your cookies up; go get you a ladder
We do it early like Cheerios and a bagel

Okay, I was on my way to school, I do's me
I hopped out the drab grabbed my juice-y
I hop skipped and jumped past them hoopdies
But wait, I forgot to grab my loose sleeves
I doubled right b-back like ""Who's that?""
I did a little dance like b-kat-b-boom-kat
I like how the jocks be watching me, man
So I grabbed my crotch and said ""hee-hee""
I be like bum stickety bum while I popped my gum
They looking dumb dickety dumb think they stopped in some
Uh, I said excuse me honey, I'm B-Bugs Bunny
No more funny - ain't got my carrots he ain't got nothing from me
'Cause we the Mean Girls ""yes, we're so fetch""
And when we in the yard - be jumping double dutch
We Back To The Future - Pearl, you were the best!
Now I got everybody looking at me
I got everybody looking at me

Ooh-woah, ooh-woah!

She lives fantasies, my life's dreams are plastic
Her goals are stretched out, my goals arent elastic
Below average D's, same time, she's fantastic
She's the tip of the iceberg, I'm below water (gigantic)
She's a barbie girl - just perfect and flawless
Lives in Utopia, so care free - lawless
I'm stuck in hell, better yet, this place called Earth
Where humans degrade humans over materialistic worth
Where three dollar cotton turns into a three hundred dollar shirt
But Barbie, get that matching three hundred dollar skirt
Maybe it's Maybelline or maybe the people behind it
And if you don't understand that then you can just rewind it
It's okay, I can take some time and wait
'Cause I can spill my heart here but half of you can't relate
And turn around and just debate
Whether Nicki Minaj's verse is real or is it fake?

I'm a Barbie girl in the Barbie world

Queen Radio - The Cardi B Drag,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The disgusting pig this person is:
Calling a dead child a monkey, but telling people somebody talked about your child that never talked about your motherfucking child
So you can get some fucking sympathy points?
They can't feed they fuckin’ family
Because you mad at what another man sticked his dick inside of
You mad... you mad at a woman for what a man is doin'
And that's a problem with so many black women and women, period
Oh, ’cause she's not black, she refers to you black women...
Oh we got the receipts for that too...
She refers to black women as monkeys and roaches
ROACHES!
These are the women going hard... for her... the roaches... when the lights come out...

They stay scrambling, the roaches! We roaches!
Black women is roaches now!
We roaches, be clear!
Now, I'ma say... No!
So there are two beautiful women right now...
Who... who... have been accused of... whoever they slept with, and you know, whatev...
And so they were, you know, allegedly attacked
And they're cut up everywhere...
But oh, not by women, men!
You sent a man to beat on women!
Lemme tell you... I'ma say it again...
What's sad is that a lot of times a man can hurt a woman so badly
That she no longer even knows who she's angry at
And what happens is... first of all let's get on 1-800 number for PostPartum Depression
Because, let me tell you something, that’s nothing to joke about
You just had the biggest blessing of your life with a child
And in one week you have attacked three women?
One at Fashion Week, and left looking the way you left looking so that people could point their fingers at our culture and at our community and laugh at us some more?

Lemme tell you something, a woman cannot give your man pussy
If he doesn’t stick his dick in there
Who are you angry at, sweetheart?
And you wanna let your publicist write something about stopping bags?!
Do you know what the fuck it is to sit in your fucking room for hours and days at the time writing raps?!
You came into my fucking culture!
I've never had to fuck a DJ to play my songs!
This is not funny and this is not about attacking
This is about getting this woman some fucking help!
This woman is at the best stage of her career and she’s out here throwing bottles and throwing shoes?!
Who the fuck is gonna get her a fucking intervention?!
Get the fuck outta here with this bullshit!
You niggas don't care until somebody is fucking dead!
You niggas want somebody to fucking die until y'all stop!
Until you stop this bullshit, laughing at this shit, this shit ain't fuckin’ funny!
You put your hands on certain people, you gon' die!

Rise of a Superstar (Part 1) - Nicki Minaj,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Before I begin, I would like to note that I am not a ""Barb"" – that’s not to be taken as a negative statement, but rather to let you, the reader, know that my opinions aren’t biased
With that out of the way, I am someone who extremely respects the accelerated rise of a superstar - and not just someone who tops the Billboard Hot 100 with one or two songs to later fade into non-relevance
Don’t get me wrong, I'm all about artists having their ""moment"" - but creating that moment, while still a pretty monumental task, is the easy part. What's hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top
To become a mainstay in the music industry, it takes multiple hit songs, impressive live performances, educated sit-down interviews, and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar. It also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers – because, let’s face it, how can someone be labeled a “superstar” without having earned the respect from fans, the media, and even other artists?
And while it’s not often that a new superstar emerges, if I had one word to describe Nicki Minaj and her meteoric rise to fame, it would be just that – superstar
We all know the backstory – Nicki was born in Trinidad, moved to New York City as a child with her family, had a rough childhood as her father, attended LaGuardia High School (not because of her rapping, but acting), and was eventually signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money label
During the lengthy bidding war for Nicki Minaj, which involved various record labels, Lil Wayne had hopes that she would eventually sign with him and become the “First Lady of Young Money”. After some persuasion, as well as a $5 million dollar signing-bonus, his dream became a reality
That following year, as we all know with the release of her debut album, “Pink Friday”, a superstar began to emerge…
What’s so ironic about the accelerated rise to fame for Nicki Minaj is that the adversity she had to deal with as a child isn’t even the biggest obstacle that she had to overcome to be a star
The real hurdle in her way, and one that has caused problems for many female rappers of this past decade, was making a name for herself in the male-driven and male-dominated world that is rap
With a large amount of guest appearances to her name – including being featured on songs by hip hop heavyweights Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé and on songs by pop icons Mariah Carey, Madonna, and Britney Spears – Nicki made a name for herself by outshining her more-established peers on their own songs
As the most successful commercial female rapper of all-time, Nicki also proved that she could compete for airplay on Top 40 radio with smash hits like “Superbass”, “Starships”, and “Moment For Life”. No longer was she confined to creating singles for urban radio, but she was now a bonafide-hit across all genres
Now, with a staggering net worth of over $50 million, Nicki has proven that she can hang with any male rapper in the game bar-to-bar, create radio-friendly and chart-topping hits that rival those of pop’s biggest acts, and attract the attention of huge brand names like Coke, Pepsi, MAC, and Adidas for multi-million dollar endorsement deals
If that’s not the power of a superstar, then I don’t know what is",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-rise-of-a-superstar-part-1-nicki-minaj-lyrics

So every minute that I’ve spend with you

And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin

When flowers bloom in may
I go back to yesterday
When I woke up next to you
I would bring it all back if I could
Make it good or bad
I know it is too late
So I’m moving on
But I won`t forget
All that is unsaid
So every minute that I’ve spend with you
Like the winter, is bringing the blues
You and I were like the spring
Brief and beautiful
When we knew we had to let it go
And our love turned in to snow
We never had a chance to begin
Brief and beautiful
So...
Brief and beautiful
So...
It was so short
It was so sweet
Like every good thing
It`s not yours to keep
Everything fades away
And now it’s gone",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-brief-and-beautiful-lyrics

Crazy how you've got me going
You're not the average one
Your swagger, your style
You got me caught in a dream
Let me sleep, I don't wanna wake up

Just jumped off the beach, I'm back on track
Ha ha ha ha ha, had to laugh on this one
You know I had to go and show my ass on this one

Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin' the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up, now I'm tellin LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma
These birds all fly south in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin' on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle;
I'ma be a queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch - no muzzle. (no muzzle)

Tell em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei

Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have the rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-up in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back east salt fish ackes
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling kinda cocky

Rememba them chicks from the bricks round 96'

Oh you mean Leah, Lil sister Maria
I use to go see her in front of the Pizzaria

I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you know from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, use to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp warnin me, now I'm warnin you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do

Damn imma have to send her to her maker

Long erection, nice complexion
Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain ain't stop till the cum came
But thats word to Hip Hop

Call the coroner!!
Its gonna be a lot of black dresses & chest vestes

And we cook oxtails
Got a scale for whats in the mail

Damn! Bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in ya prom pictures, salon with ya
Now they wanna creep in ya man Jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cuz imma put the heat to ya beak
You bird like tweet tweet
And watch her smoke like a ciggarete

Leave all them foul bitches wet

Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one

How To Break A Heart,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I hang on every word you said and
No one could get inside my head like you
Then I guess I was a fool for you then

It was all part off your plan

To feel like I don't ever wanna let somebody ever get that close to me again
I learned so much from you
Things I'd never do
Now that we're apart
You taught me how to break a heart
Dear God if you can hear me know
Please stop the anger building up inside me
I need you to come and guide me

Of the one I thought was mine
And my only scream is

Not a cloud in the sky
Casts a shade on me
Colours shining bright
Oh, Its so surreal
And on this perfect day
I got lost
Get me out of this confusion
I'm falling apart
I've got an aching heart
I'm so out of place

And what I feel
Makes me break down and cry
How it hurts
How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever
So I carry on
Pretending I'm okay
On a perfect day
I'm drowning in memories
Throw me a lifeline, don't think its my time
And I can hardly breathe
Oh, why did you have to leave

How it multiplies
It's not a temporary pain
Cause it sticks like glue forever

We can't stand the laws
You're watching over us, taking care of us
Until we meet again, my friend
You are everything to me and I love you for it

How it multiplies

Musica che è sempre uguale
Luci basse che mi danno un po' fastidio
Quelle gambe un po' intriganti
Con le calze trasparenti
Qui si fanno tutte belle ma chissà per chi
Forse io dovrei andare
Quasi l'ora di dormire
Se mi guarda ancora un po' mi sa che vado lì
Sì ma tanto cosa dico
Hai un ragazzo o un marito
Studi o fai un lavoro interessante e unico
Io non voglio più sprecare una parola
Perché il gioco proprio non lo reggo più
Cose della serie tu sei qui da sola
Sono anni che mi urtano
Mi rovinano da troppo tempo
L'ultimo bicchiere e me ne andrò
Che non se ne può più
Di tutte queste storie finte che si basano sui film
Ma non ti danno mai qualcosa
Più di un freddo vuoto
Quante storie storie vere lui che le offrirà da bere
Come se non si capisse che intenzioni ha
Forse non per amicizia e neanche con dolcezza
Ma poi lei dirà tu che cos'hai capito
Io non voglio più sprecare una parola
Perché il gioco proprio non lo reggo più
Cose della serie tu sei qui da sola

The hood's first lady, you know?
Baby girl of the group, I'm also known as baby girl in the coupe
Never get me confused with baby girl in the hoop
Cuz' Nicki stay fly like that Cash Money do
I'm stuntin' on these hoes like Marilyn Monroe
I gotta esk-curl flow spit slick ya know?
Now I don't just spit raps and chit chat
Nicki could get it in, Nicki could spit gats
Your girl got hustle, Nicki could pitch crack
But Nicki rather chill and stack a mil'
While these hoes stay in hoods like rats for real
My voice stay on the track like a Mac for real
Riding the baseline like Quille O' Neal
Gassed ya baby father for the keys to the Esclalade
Not a baby momma put I'm Drama like K Slay
What could I say? It's how ya girl do
Ya girl stay fresh down to her cuticles
My people smoke dutches we don't fluck wit bamboo
I'm a winner mami, your careers' a gamble
Old ass broad off track like bow weez
Nicki stay on the toes on point like ballerines
Lemme remind you I'm getting a tan too
Ya caramel dream, ya girl from queens
They say I'm too pretty to be spitting sixteen
I should be on the screen, posing for Maybelline
Or be a baby phat girl getting on my jean
Hood star broad, black barbie doll
Pardon me if the cockiness bothering y'all
I'm just being Nicki Minaj, ya know?
Girl from around way without the L Cool J
While you spit kool-aid, I spit acid out
Doing this since you was Reebok Classic out
And this hoe wanna get at Nick? Why?
Cuz' I bagged her baby daddy, she ain't seen him since
Nick so caught up, lil tank top, Ed Hardy zone
Some Dolce Gaban pretty panties on
Like wait til' the summer, catch me up in the hummer
On my way to 55 front, row with the Rucker
Every baller wanna, never give out my number
Only the email, cherrythong.com, holla
Name a girl as real as her, nope not dem
Who's ya best MC's? Nick Fox and KIm
Nick up in the Porsche, box or the Benz nigga
Outro:
Dirty Money, you heard? I do it, I do it for fun like
I mean I just do it cuz' I can like
I only rap because I'm good at it like, really
You know what I'm sayin'? It really was a hobby for a minute
But then you know what I'm sayin'? I was like, ""Damn look at the state of hip-hop, like what's goin' on?""
Nah but thanks for the love, to everybody you know what I'm sayin'?
Shout out to New York, shout out to everybody who seeing this right now like I'm just on my grind, don't get it twisted
Like it's not a, not even about being cocky, it's just about being real
Like I'm, like I'm good at what I do, so you know what I'm sayin'?
That's why I act the way I act like don't get it twisted like if you see me, holla at me
I'm never too ill to stay, ""What up?""
Like it's not that serious trust me I know that
But anyway, holla at ya girl, hit me up on MySpace or something

Inconsolable,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Memories frozen in a picture frame
Days go on things will never be the same, anymore
Thoughts of you and the life we never lived
How can I pull through, when you left to soon
I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you hear me, I am inconsolable
I wish I’d know you better, time was running out
The quilt I left is more than I can describe
And I keep on calling your name to feel that I’m alive
In this empty space, I could never be replaced
I belief, A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t move on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable
Everyday I try to carry on, everyday I try to find a meaning
Living in a place where I belong, as cold ice can be
If I could take you back to yesterday
But not for ever gone it’s in considerable
It almost that acceptable
Memories frozen in a picture frame
How can I pull through, when you left to soon
I can’t go on, pretending everything could be the way we where
How can you see me, when I’m inconsolable
A part of you will always stay with me
I can feel that images of you will never fade away
I can’t go on, pretending everything’s gonna be the way we where
Why can’t you see me, when I am inconsolable",https://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-inconsolable-lyrics

Sveglia alle 7, mi lavo in fretta
Butto giù un caffè, prendo la moto
Faccio mezz'ora di strada ma arrivo
Più o meno puntuale in quella scuola
Solite facce, solita gente, solita giornata
Mentre il mio prof mi guarda schifato i capelli
Dice: ""Questo è un posto serio!""
Ma io non sono come voi
No, a me non frega niente
Se cammino e mi sento dire
Tagliati i capelli
Che non vanno più di moda!
Tagliati i capelli
Se vuoi fare strada!
Tagliati i capelli
Che sembri un barbone, un drogato, insomma
Tagliati i capelli
Come me!
Ore 14, ma dove sono
E cosa sto facendo qui
Sto certamente buttando via tempo
Pensando a tutt'altro che alla scuola
""Guarda che gli anni dei capelloni
Sono già passati da un bel pezzo!""
Pazzo!
Io che ti guardo negli occhi e ti rispondo
Che a me non me frega un...

Roman’s Revenge Alternate Version (I FEEL PRETTY),UnKnown,2010.0,"I feel pretty (x3)
And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

I ain’t into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I’ll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering ""Why, God?"" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life’s hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life’s treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don’t ask why, bitch (Ask why not)

I feel ugly (x3)
Slut don't touch me or hug me
I'm mad and I pity any girl who gets with me tonight

You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi’s
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin

All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)

I feel pretty (x3)
And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight

Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon

Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
