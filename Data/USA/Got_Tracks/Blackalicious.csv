Alphabet Aerobics,A2G EP,1999.0,"(Now it's time for our wrap up
Let's give it everything we've got
Ready? Begin)

Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats, got they canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doin' dough
Demonstrations, 
Don Dada
 on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode
, elevated etiquette
Furious, fat, fabulous, fantastic
Flurries of funk felt, feeding the fanatics
Gift got great, global goods gone glorious
Gettin' godly in this game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella hype, historical
Hey holocaust hymns, hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice, naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quannnum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got, uh
Really raw raps, risin' up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique, untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make 'em vanish
While I'm all well would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my workshift
Xerox my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters and xylophone tones
Yellow-back,
 yak mouth, young ones' yaws
Yesterday's lawn yardsale, I yawn
Zig-Zag zombies, zooming to the zenith
Zero in, Zen thoughts, overzealous rhyme
Zealots!

Chemical Calisthenics,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"Ha ha ha good
Can you say it faster?

I can do anything
Neutron, proton, mass effect, lyrical oxidation, you're irrelevant
Mass spectrograph, your electronvolt, atomic energy erupting
As I get all open on betatrons, gamma rays thermo cracking
Cyclotron any and every mic you're on
Trans iridium, if you're always uranium
Molecules, spontaneous combustion, pow
Law of definite proportion, gaining weight
I'm every element around
Lead, gold, tin, iron, platinum, zinc, when I rap you think
Iodine nitrate activate
Like Germanium, the only difference is I transmit sound
Balance was unbalanced then you add a little talent in
Careful, careful with those ingredients
They could explode and blow up if you drop them
And they hit the ground
Let it blow, yo, just let it go, get back
Ca(OH)₂ wine water solution of calcium hydroxide
Slobbin' it, CaO lime will make bleach powder
Galvanic metal beats stomp out louder
Dried ice, CO squared refrigerant
NO₂ makes you laugh, it's laughing gas used by dentists
I'm muriatic acid glue, I'm like oil vitriol, the king of chemicals
Energy heat gas waved all your mats
Chemical change, ice point, melt all your raps
Atomic weight, hold shocks, when you call
Refillable gas keep going way beyond biatch
I'm only ill with buzzin', feel the ambiance
Adiabatic process oughta calm your ass
After I warm your ass, I'll give sodium silicate NO₂S₁O₃, a water glass
Borax flexure full of brimstone sulfur
Boracic acid, hip-hop preserver
CO₂ could never put away the fire
Style aromas is scientific; the lyrical fuse would be connected
To teach you chemical calisthenics
(C4)
The theory is that all matter is composed of at least three fundamental particles
Protons, electrons, neutrons, protons are charged positive
By now you've guessed electrons are probably negatively charged
Neutrons don't follow either, neutral, in the middle, only no apologies
Centered, unmoved by yin and yang ideology
Neutron, bomb songs, electron fury
Cosmic musical radioactivity
Different points in joints within infinity
Oxygen and hydrogen alive within all types of energy
Within all types of energy
Within all types of energy
Within all types of energy
Within all types of energy, inside a world, inside a world
Inside a universe, inside of me existing although I can't see it
Hydrocarbon, nitrogen cycle, ionization
Heavier than electric motor metals that weigh over a ton
This has been a Chemist, Blackalicious creation
Clean out your desk, put your papers away 'cause class is almost done
(All aboard for the night train)
This is chemistry plus calisthenics
I'm calcium plus potassium, magnesium, newspaper of sodium, sulfate
Your solvent, chloroform, remedy from the norm
Glycerin, purest form Titanium
There is no way out, when this newfy is out
Of all arms vibration, forming in a nigga
Some bleachin' to teach ya religious is equal to pieces of meteor
Eager to be here or is it, can see here I know all of all
I'ma pickin' up pretty little Cindy
I'm more, I'm thinkin' of more
I'm cookin' a potion!",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-chemical-calisthenics-lyrics
Make You Feel That Way,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"Make you feel that way 

Up and early for the hope of a brand new day
See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day
Fresh haircut fitted with a fat-ass fade
End of work, we chilling on a Saturday
How you felt when you first heard the Daddy Kane
Rakim, KRS - hey I had that tape
Cooling out with ol' girl on a fat-ass date
Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great
Get promoted at your job up to management
Plot a long time finally a plan has made it
Sometimes I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way


Christmas Day when your mama got your first bike
Type of feeling when you went and won your first fight
How your team felt winning championship games
Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain
Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen
Put in hard work finally you're living your dream
Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes
Blind man gain his sight see his first sunrise
Young man speaking out, now he's loud and clear
Birthin' your child, smile so proud you wear
Going in your 3rd eye for the styles you hear
Making music that'll bump for a thousand years
Eating right feeling conscious like health is first
Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work
Times I feel I want to shout, man it's real that way
When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way


All up in her vibe something coming over me
Summer days more likely that you notice breeze
Winter days more likely that you notice heat
When I'm gone, more likely that you notice me
In the dark it's more likely that you notice light
In the light more likely that you notice night
Hungry, more appreciation for that meal
Dead broke, more appreciation for that scrill(a)
A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good
And that'll make things a little better understood
Times I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-make-you-feel-that-way-lyrics

Prevalent melanin elephant bailin'
And carrying sedatives that'll give average lettermen callouses
Wrecking with savageness, catalyst
Battling rappers'll stagger right after the dagger is left in it
Cherish this caliber. (Release) 
Atticus
Shatter your algebra with calculus

Damage your patterns I'm pounding you so fabulous (give it up)
Enough is enough is enough and I'm busting up outta this shell
An eruption that ruptures your structure to fuck with you (Release)
Up in ya gut, you a costumer
Huffing and puffing, discussing absolutely nothing, disgusting me
Plus infinity's up in me rushing your country percussion
No wonder you're struck in the boundaries
Wake up if you're lunging, I'm something, you're nothing (Release)
Now come see me grunting
I'm hunting for what emcees want
And I'm stomping my foot through your armies
They couldn't have stopped me with shotties
Oddity, why did he, why do these entire societies inside of societies
And survivors still remain alive (Release) emcees
Thriving to flow, opting to go
Five hundred and fifty-five syllables to go
Split em' with the subliminal intentional digital pro
Unlimited flows unriveted, inhibited, visited
Now you can't get rid of it like (Release) what is this
This magnificent, intimate, inner wit, in a minute finna be antonyms
In it with a gig, big fat heads like eggs Benedict
Pigs lick shit
, rip with words and abysmal energy
It's time I (destroy the beast, release)

Inner breathlessness, outer restlessness
By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath
Grandma asked me what I'm running for
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
What mothers birth their youngens for
And some say Jesus coming for
For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barter's bard, barb of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A mantra to fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter vs. spirit
. 
Through meditation
I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation

The heaven-sent benevolent medicine man reverend
Peddling deliverance that resemble amphetamines to
The residents in the meadow of pestilence
Who developed a chemical dependence on pessimism, now
Is he is, or is he ain't
The most distinctive speaker seeping through your sleepy speakers
Yes he is, oh, yes indeed
So distinguished, so close some people think he's half 
Ain't no secret, people, trust me
It's mostly hustling
That moves me upstream
But just focus on the unseen
Boasting and fussing
They both so unproductive
Suppose it go in my blood stream
Let me pose this question
Ask anybody, that's anybody
They'll tell you that the antibody to the petty
Potty mouth gossiping is
Success at something
To be the best at something
And not to stress the dumb shit
Cause you ain't missing nothing
You got to

Motivate, accelerate, never wait, know your weight, throw away hate
Grow and make weight of your older days

Elevate, concentrate, get your focus straight, aim, orchestrate fate
Astrologists, colleges follow this through the metropolis
The dominant brown bomber, I'm in it, being prominent
Walking it mean, talking it, clean the scene, stalking it

And allways all day

Cause they can't catch us
They all pray for our downfall
Maybe one day, sike!
You never get no balance if you're crooked so play right, snake

Oncoming, onslaught, on one
Chopping you, I'll tomahawk, trauma hawk

Started cutting off the people he came up with (up with)
Ego blown like his soul had been abducted (abducted)
Though his heart was once real, now material has filled
Up his world, and he couldn't get enough of it (get enough of it)
Used to wanna be the best of the rap dons (rap dons)
Now his only one concern is going platinum (platinum)
And his skills has since decreased, and the inner hunger ceased
Now content, just as long as fame and cash come (cash come)
He's a Big Willie now, rapping 'bout cars

Let's give it everything we've got
Ready?

Alley-alley-alley-alley-oop on amateurs
Air above all and any actors that’s average
Big barbarian basically beasting
Biters get blown up being brave, beatings
Casually, I chef cash cheddar, fools get
Casualties and caught off guard with chin music
Dirty when I drop dimes damaging the dang earth
Devastate the defense detonate danger
Entertainer entertaining everyone and every mass
Enemies is envious ain’t even peep the elbow pass
Fire en fuego flick of the wrist foes in
Fear of the fury left flattened and frozen
Gloves off for the glass jaw by the goons
G.O.A.T of all G.O.A.T.S gone giddy gettin’ through
Human joystick, heating up, heat check BLAM
Hit ‘em hard, hella hyped, hero going H.A.M
I’m isolated on islands it’s over, it’s over
Ice in your veins getting colder
Juke jock jerk to those who aren’t worthy
Jamming through my journey in a jet black jersey
King Kong of K.O.s kid kiss the ring
Knuckle up now with the knuckle buck king
Lemme live a long life leading with my laces out
Right now losers look up cause it’s lights out
My moves marvelous, money shot, massive
Main event, moon-shot, MVP, master
Nails in the coffin knots in their knees, triumph
Nutmeg through their knees nothing but nylon
Opposition oft on the ropes in the octagon
One-two, punched out, lights going off and on
Pillow picked passes of prolific poetry
Power plays, pickpocketing petty phonies
Quest for the cup, it’s quantum y’all, quote me
Quiet all quitters feeling qualms when we’re quarreling
Raw ringside riots relish and remain
Rallying, rough rated rhymes make it rain
Swishin’ on simple soft suckers spitting swag
Slice dice shimmy nothing-but-net, splash
Turnt up, taking out timid minds. Twister
Leave ‘em turnt out, they are truck stick victims
Unstoppable ups, stay uninvolved
Unanimous, universal, year of the underdog
Vicious and vital, victories calling
Volley y’all out victorious velocity
Bob and weave well, wide receiving words woven
Moonwalk when I whip, get the world open
X-celling, X-treme, X-tra X-plosive
X-hilarating X-out competition so quick
Yolo pass rhymes, y’all young bucks fall
Yoga stretch rhymes yelling yiggy yes y’alls
Zero zero zero on the clock, game’s over
Zoomin to the zenith, zero out, in my zone, ZONING!!

The Blowup,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"Girl I'm a wizard
Write rhymes that bring forth
Whirlwinds and blizzards
Start early and end it
I'm barely beginning
Emcee warfare I'm buried in the trenches
Y'all lynching all y'all fall captured in the abyss
Deep inside, peeping eat them like I was Brotha Lynch
Revolutionary rhyme style make the government paranoid
Of hidden metaphors wonder what I meant
Cut a vent trough your mental  thoughts
If you ain't about this lyricism homie kick rocks
 thought patterns. Y'all get ready for the liftoff
 touring kicking deadly predicates  sick vibe
Step into your village, set it off with this style
Now you eating humble pie instead of talking shit now
Set it off and give hell, better run and get out
Rappers that attempted me need medical assist now
Get up on it nigga, rollin' so official
Never let up on it, I'mma flow and blow and just flow
Rollin over that flow, rollin over this flow
Pressure cooker tension overloading
It's the big Blow Up!

Everybody make way it's the blowup
Everybody check it out it's the blowup
One time for your mind it's the blowup
Party people in the house it's the blowup
Everybody check it out it's the blowup
Make way make room it's the blowup
Everybody everybody it's the blowup
Check it out ya'll it's the blowup

I blow the hinges off the door
And make the roof crumble
And if suckers want to rumble then I'll take it to them
Ain't nothing they can think or say and nothing they can do
Blinder than Ray Charles with rhymes of fury I'ma make it do
What it do, sucker free, spot a fraud and shake a fool
Bring your lady to the battle with your boy I'll take her too
Take her to my crib and make a plate of food
Pimping while she venting to me what she really think of you
Every time you catch up with my rapping style I'll make up new patterns
Breaking atoms, while I'm spazzing as I take your crew out
Peasant kiss my pinky ring I am a king to you
Good and thorough putting words together like I'm Langston Hughes
I punish rappers with the things I do, spanking fools
 a sound let's go and hold it down just like an anchor do
Don of lyricism how I rank and rule
Bringing fools to a higher level up without all of the dank and brew
They do what they be doing think I make a new style a day my lyrics stretch a mile a day
Hey but who's counting on who got the flow and rhyming insurmountable
The pressure cooker tension's elevating its about to blow up

Everybody make way it's the blowup
Everybody check it out it's the blowup
One time for your mind it's the blowup
Party people in the house it's the blowup
Everybody check it out it's the blowup
Make way make room it's the blowup
Everybody everybody it's the blowup
Check it out ya'll it's the blowup",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-the-blowup-lyrics

First in flight

Cause all we got is rhythm and timin'
First in flight
We go beyond the edge of the sky

Free! Like a bird out in the wind in the night
Like a 747 to LA that's in flight
Free! Like a garden flourishing in the wind
Like a student bout to do it when he's graduatin'
Free! From any of the energy perception
Can never be defined create the definition within
Free! Just lovin' life itself and never pretend to be
Anything other than the man I was meant to be
Travel through time and get a glimpse of the centuries
To come a better day is promised remember
Free, like my nephew in a few months about to be out the penitentiary
Meditation, meditation, meditation
Meditation, meditation, meditation

Just put the pedal to the metal see what ya find
You back there slouchin' over, won't you pick up your spine?
Let's make it really really happen live up this time
Cause you can choose to say ""Good morning, God"" or ""Good God, morning"" 
(Good morning!)
With black clouds storming 
(Good morning!)
I walk without umbrellas into these woods
Don't need 'em cause the mighty trees above will shelter me good
I'm eating berries from the bushes of the heavenly good
From the states 
the power came to us whenever we stood
Reverberatin' out, a-reachin' each and every hood
Whenever we could the spiritual anatomy fool
But never take the credit for it B cause that'd be rude
It's just the way in life we searchin for that had to be new
You gotta work it though cause everyday ain't Saturday fool
Evolve into a better life and be happy with you and you'll be

Rise! Like the sun up at the crack of the dawn
Like a wakin child in the morning stretchin and yawnin
Rise!
 Like an infant being held in the light
Like the smoke from an incense when it's ignited
Rise! If you're sleepin won't you open your eyes again
The greatest high be that natural high within
No need to force in the progression just ride the wind
You'll know the answer to the where and the why and when
If you keep workin' for your search you will find the end
Though at the end you'll find it only begins again
See at the end you see it only begins again
And everything you learn you're only rememberin'
Cause you're

It's clockwork, got work
Put it in like doctors with awkwardness
Mopped your whole flock and walked toward ya
Scattered all up on the chalkboard
Socrates self is thoughtless
From farmers to Metropolis
I get these process all twisted
Form mental visual optics
My job description rock wiz
Clock ticks, I'm toxic giving oxygen to the thoughtless
Intoxicant knocking the planet off its axis
Like oxes 
Boxing compin' up out though
Peepin it loose
Seeped in to you
Begin in to the outro...
MC is what I be about though
The freshest with or without though
I can outflow any little doubt your little mouth throw out so
Take it out though, so I'm a gardener
I'm a chef eatin' all you carnivores
I'm an ancient Zen master philosophic thought
Comin' like the Art of War
Handyman with lyrical hardware
And my house ain't made a ginger
But it's made of an array of pages that'll slay ya like a ninja
Unemployed, no, I got work
And my job description: a rap technician
From sunup to sundown
And it's clockwork

Do you understand?
Every beat he make
Which sucker DJ's persist to take
You understand?
Lyrics that I write
When put to his music sound out of sight
You understand?
Master of scratch
And if the needle was to slip it's the needle he'll catch
You understand?
The way he rock
Which is 24-oh-7 around the clock

Grabbin' the mic and unravelin' with
The force of a javelin hit
Travelin Gift of Gab and I'm it
MCs are havin a fit
A man and a myth with a hat of magical tricks
Stored in my cabina-net
Jammin' and rippin' the average listener
Cramming in it like a sandwich
A bit at a time
This critical rhyming individual shine your pitiful kind
It's little so little that I will belittle your mind
Nigero tearin' yo ego and spiritual flows
Divine imperial
Signed and delivered, so take time rewind and give it all
Your undivided attention
Divide is in division
Subtraction and addition
See I'm like a mathematician
Egyptologist wisdom
Hip-hop holy man submerging you all in my baptism
Security guard of the rap prison
Slap rhythms into newborns
And birth rap ism into blunts from sacks hittin'
Get 'em off and make fat dividends
Now that's livin'

Do I have to give up my signature?
To get ya to figure out
I'm walking the path that Allah had planted
Or Jah, whoever you give your shout to
If your doubts
Rip you out your physical, watch your spiritual drift up out
Floatin' up on your way to infinity, kiss the clouds
Just about
When you get to the point where the alien ships are out
Tell 'em I sent you to help ya and give ya directions
Wherever you're going so that you don't miss the route
See, I send you traveling far
Unadulterated cleverness
And you'll never catch a flaw
I'm a hip-hop astrologist
And my raps a shooting star
I'm a bartender all into your mental
Sittin' at the bar ventures, force injure
More injure pretenders the inventor of plenty other dozens
Your loving buzzin' at your door like Jehovah witnesses in the fall
If I was your landlord you wouldn't need to pay the rent at all
Just give me applause whenever I floss, that'll be the only cost

Shallow Days,Nia,1999,"I just keep moving on... (moving on...)
I just keep moving on... (moving on...)

Time and time, a brother asks why
The rhyme is not laced with a gangsta touch
I said ""Simply because I don't live that way
Still kickin' them rhymes rugged and rough""
""But that won't sell
Cause you gotta keep it real
So that we can feel
Where you're coming from
Because these streets is ill
 
so if you ain't
Killing niggas in rhymes
Your whole sound's just bubble gum""
I said 
""I won't contribute to genocide;
I'd rather try to cultivate the inner side
And try to evolve the frustrated ghetto mind
The devil and his army never been a friend of mine""
""But niggas don't wanna hear that shit"" said the brother
Who was obviously totally misled and yelled out
""murder murder, kill, murder"" instilled in the influential thoughts
Of our kids' heads

Shallow days, you never wanna
Let a brother be a brother
Fully inner to the outer
Caught up in all them hollow nights
Can't escape cause everywhere that I look
People front, and it just ain't right
(repeat)

I said ""Don't you know the powers that be
Are using people as pawns, devouring we
Until they see us all gone and outta the scene""
And as I passed the chronic,
 he said ""look at where I be
I tried to get a job for real
But all the homies hit liqs and rob and steal
And keep fat pockets caught in a rut to catch ground
This way's in, plus who could you trust?""
I said ""I'm all about protecting mine
But neglected minds be gettin' left behind
Why don't you change your environment?""
He said ""This is all I know
Plus my fam's all that I got, I can't go""
I said ""You gotta make it for the fams""
""Damn,"" he said ""I didn't make the ghetto
The ghetto made the man""
I said ""You're more than just that,""
Shook his hand, said ""Damn, you gotta find a way
To break the devil's master plan, peace""

Shallow days, you never wanna
Let a brother be a brother
Fully inner to the outer
Caught up in all them hollow nights
Can't escape cause everywhere that I look
People front, and it just ain't right
(repeat)

The word ""peace"" is just an expression
Used to say bye when it's time to jet
And them red black and green medallions
Was all just part of the trend, I guess
Hardly ever them around brothers' necks no more
Instead of that gold, gats;
Inspiring gangstas and macks
Who at the young age of four
Be seeing more drama than war veterans
Instead of learning God's laws
And hip-hop is a voice that we enlisted
To express how we be feeling about this and that
But music does reflect life
And kids look up to what you're portraying
And mimic what you act like
It's time for a new day
An era in rap, conscious styles
Makin' them aware of the happenings
But their ears seem more steered towards
Self-annihilation so then they might laugh
And write this off, 
like I'm out here just
Blowing wind, maybe label us soft or unreal
Something they just can't feel,
 
while they yell
""murder murder murder, kill kill kill""

I just keep movin' on (moving on ...)
I just keep movin' on (moving on ...)

Sky is Falling,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

The sky is falling, life is appalling, and death is lurking
Niggas killing each other leaving bodies nobodies searching for
And juveniles is losin' trials, catching a bit of murder one
And mothers is drinking and drugging, hoein', searching for their son
And liquor stores upon every corner 
and younger people
Done accepted defeat in the melting pot of lavas seeping
And the hood is all the mind can conceive when your foes bleeding to their death
And you picking their pocket all to just get even
Niggas is banging, they fathers was banging, they unc's thuggin'
Highly intelligent Africans lowered to punks muggin'
And the coppers is the Klan, and the planet is run by the government
And genocidal thieves, all the while the devil is loving it
And children in high school rollin' through smokin' their classes up
And people that's rich don't be checking for what is happening
Degrading our women, knockin' 'em up, leave 'em, now smack 'em up
And ain't no way to reach us we're sleeping like hell's castle
Sky is falling

Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

The sky is falling, no one is watching, tornadoes twisting
Whereas nobody is listening and fires no one pays attention
Energies are erupting blurring the intentional vision
Doctors and lawyers and scientists all are locked in the prison
Of the mind, and all the youth are unreachable but they teachable
But emcees don't be teaching them to, they deep down in their soul
Amongst the prostitution and pimping, robbing and stealing
We give a name (Sab- a truth), this is nigga-land (Glad to knew ya)
But give a damn (for the future), religions is institutionalized
Hidden truths, given you the lies
You got two pistols at the head of your own people
It's lethal but it's living proof
Instead of leaving smiles leading death inside of our living room
And instead of college, they got us slangin' after highschool
For the love of the money and everything that it will buy you
Everybody out for that and they kill you if you a rival
Twenty lions and one steak on the table, it's about survival
The sky is falling

Rain and thunder
And lightning crumbling
Buildings falling
Hurricanes Earth shattering
Membranes scattering
Insane happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting down

From the Now captive
To the Plantation

You'll never ever grasp the clever
Vast and relevantness step and thrash all through your meadow bastard like an elephant
My head expands forever every chance I get to tear a jam
I shred and mash shit

In a trance, you're spitting trash my man begin again
My mind is militant and will reveal your little innocence
The citizens of villages be like hey Gift, oh you're the man
My nigga can you spit again and kill them with your infinite flow
Did it and made dividends
And exit with your chick in hand

Bound to pound the sound and clown and diss the lesser groundedness
So fresh astounding with these records
Y'all ain't shit to us your non-existent flow will fall to shit
You step inside of our existence all of y'all will call your momma Just to save you from the trauma
This is Quannum call your doctor
Get your karma falling all upside your noggin
Stallin' with them rhymes that sound like I was sounding
When I was a toddler barely walkin'
Romping through playschool with slobber falling out my mouth
From ga-ga-in' and goo-goo-in'
It's voodoo when you step into new energy
I threw you when you kick them simple rhymes
That you do when you rap
Fool you in a trap, see me and you doo-doo in your pants
Rule you with my grand iron hand go through you with a lance
As my mind expands I enhance
Do you feel my wrath?
Your girl had told me Gabby, I so love listening to you man

I like-I like-I like-I like-I like the way you talk
I like the way you talk, I like the way you talk
I like-I like-I like-I like-I like the way you talk

Check it out
On the corner a dealer, but not a dealer of death
Realer, iller, conceal a feeling, sealing there's nothing left
On the top, healing, its penicillin, you got whiffs
It's a oracle, anesthesia, I'm sure you got lifted
Oceans of rhythm inside a killer go ta death
Coming divine as I reach and travel in the depths
Moving your spirit just like you're walking through a 'X'
Choice of the generation, that come and be the peps
Bubbling all in your cups, don't even follow it up
Nothing to wallow in but the sound that you're gobbling up
Rocking your toddler until your pop and your mom and your unk-
Le and your Aunt, and all of your partners swallow the funk
It's just a little something that open your comatose
State of living in Babylon, with the spiritually dead ghost
This is recommended, I highly advise a dose
Hopefully it inspires and maybe encourages growth

Yo

We take a journey through music right now (*2X*)

Yo, when music temptations can't be resisted
Fifths will be inconsistent make me a misfit
Listed as a phenomenon I got an oncoming bomb
Which is perfection and flexin' like I spent time in Nam
The beat is on and its nice and easy
Instrumentals blendin' like cinnamon rice and peas
And life's a breeze when you don't have to kick it to find
Contemplate the creation with Blackalicious and I
Tuna fish is full of musical entities past gone
Tryin' to hold fast and grasp hits like last fall
So last long flash on keepin' the past strong
We grab songs and rhythm so people can catch on
Yes
My mic monicker, momma I twice promised her
Love life, if music is truly your wife honor her
Burnin' to your thermometer stretch a million kilometers
Connect a population of Earth to one another for real

Music, deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music, when the melody and rhythm get to moving and unity
Movin', one force one love one whole community
Do it, keep travelin' on keep travelin' on

Underground or overboard overlord oh my lord
More and more pure sonic overjoyed soarin' towards shores
Unseen, uncharted bout to get explored
Warriors breakin' all the limits twistin' the laws
Now who said that underground is only just one more
I'm sellin' time and space and matter, making hula-hoops of Saturn's rings
And bring my bing, in sync, to think
That these was meant to be writ and be spit, so ever be writ
We on some destiny (shh shhh) we just a piece of this
We offer testament of every cultural element
Ever sent to us by the ancestors as though we manifest as
Some new world pedestrians
Just lounging with some fishin' poles up on the moons crescent
Just tryin to make some history spittin' on a few records
I had a dream like Martin Luther King in adolescence
And now I'm out in Tokyo and Europe havin' sessions
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin' for was present
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin' for was present
And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin' off like an army ho replay
Talkin' bout walkin' miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin' bombs with no delay

And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin' off like an army ho replay
Talkin' bout walkin' miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin' bombs with no delay

Music, deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music, when the melody and rhythm get to moving and unity
Movin', one force one love one whole community
Do it, keep travelin' on keep travelin' on

Now see we rock around the clock we don't stop for nothin'
Gonna take it to the top - non stop - no frontin'
People listen when it drops cause it speaks to something
In they souls when they all alone, spacing in the zone
Or walking they block - talking to they homey at the shop
See the point is this - even if the homey got shot
Then there still be the bump knockin' in your trunk
Get ya out your slump rockin' it straight off the top
Concotcin' it like ingredients thrown haphazardly inside a crockpot
With a magic sock, schnapps, a big ass book, and some vodka
And pass it my way cause I'm a real big talker
And I love new experiences I'm the godfather of gettin' into to trouble
On the road undercover shit - take your whole crowd if you leave em uncovered
And I believe even Hammer would say my shit's proper work
Not to put a damper on the underground answer shit
You dealin' wit motherfuckers, done underground anthems, done
Rocked from the west coast damn near to Athens and you still hate a whack song as much as the next man
And still in love with the good one
We interact with listeners this is our contribution on the war against
The whiteness and slightness, a constitution of fatness
Blackalicious, Jurassic, Maroons, Latyrical madness
Your mind is captured with tactics to get you blasted the fastest
And you still wonder, baffled at just how long does this is lastin'?
We have the fashion to classic the pure love satisfaction
Is when the magic is captured and life actions made tangible with

Music, deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music, when the melody and rhythm get to moving and unity
Movin', one force one love one whole community

Swan Lake,Melodica,1994.0,"Sittin on top of the bay, watchin the tide
It's time to break the tension away, come take a ride
As you enter the dimension of the crew SoleSides
It ain't nuttin goin on but a party
Now brothers wanna flex but I'm over they heads
I got the funky type of style to rip your vocals to shreds
I'm never runnin from the Feds wearin red Pro Keds
Cause — I ain't did nuttin to no-BODY!
I dedicate that line to Shack from South Central
Not sayin I'm the baddest but I know I got potential
For every black man hung lyrically I lynch you
Your style is kinda dry hope my melody can quench you
My soul is one with all although my ego is against you
See rap is a raw meat, so now I got to mince you
I'm playin rappers out like an old pair of gym shoes
I can do anything, I can do anything
Crusin down the street in my six-four Impala
Is what I'd like to be doin if only I had the dollars
A baller ain't a baller if he ain't got balls
A scholar ain't a scholar if he ain't got scho-lastic
Education, and if not that, then learn from life
Beyond all of the material crap
A human ain't a human if he doesn't make mistakes
And the name of this song is Swan Lake

A planet ain't a planet if it don't have wars
A battle ain't a battle if you don't catch scars
A mind that ain't inquisitive really doesn't got
Shit to live for if you can't explore the
Realms of thought you ought not test lest
You be chomped up, like a pop rock, stopped for a
Bead from the weed lady, thought it was the bomb
Really wasn't nuttin but a bag of strong palms
Lost twenty dollars, didn't get high
Maybe next time I use my finances right
Live another day, learn another lesson
Ain't no need to get my mental status cold stressin
That it's so ill that it's fo'-real that it's
No skill displayed, de shades gone now
So it's time to build my own umbrella
Tell it tell her hella mellow fellows loungin
Better bread I never fled a header of the sounds and
All I wanna do is run my own universe
Grab the mic and let my spirit just FLOCK when I croon a verse
Mind over matter, spirit over mind
A doobie and a skin funky breakbeats and rhymes
A true blue homey to the end reminiscin' with your
Sisters in the living room den
A life with a plan, nine acres on a land
Building self by yourself helpin' out a fellow man
Prepare for the essence when your inner soul's free
Before the departure plantin of the right seed
I think what everybody's strivin for is peace of mind
I'm thinkin the world is full of inner places that are out there to find
Manipulated minds need to make an escape
And the name of this song is Swan Lake
Manipulated minds need to make an escape
And the name of this song is Swan Lake",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-swan-lake-lyrics
If I May,Nia,1999," (Chorus)
Come along and reap
I need my song
We're climbin' over
Beneath the sea
March on
Time is almost gone
It's all in me
No maybe

Here we go again
Slip into my conscience
, come along an take in
A story bout a battle, in this corner, Satan
Cunning, baffling, and jumping into half the drink
And suddenly disasters and catastrophe
And acting unrationally
Reacting savagely
To passionately
Bask in everlasting like escapes from just what its creating
Jeopardizin' love
Look at all the people that you took advantage of
See your hypnotized
Rom be gone, take another cup
In consequences lurk
While the reaper got your shirt size
Nigga wake up
Times overdue for the birth of a power that the universe grew from
(Chorus 2X)

You search for the answers outside
Refocus causin' time and time again, backslide
You've noticed times before the presence of that ""I""
But never did submit to it and let it apply
Whatever be his will in this present life time
Or essence like mine
Know the blessings you might find
If you let your higher power inside
Emerge and apply to every single thing in your balance
You will truly find
Who you really are
Die and 
become reborn
When God is present in your life than you can come reap on
And ain't a storm that you can't weather
You got a purpose you was born to create
Destiny is waitin' for you
Arms open, take with ya
Knowledge bestowed by the great giver
Lakes, rivers
Mountains and steams
Now reality's the dream wraitha
No more searchin' for truth that was always wit' cha
It had to hit ya through the struggle and the turmoil
Ya soul was planted and it sprouted out above soil
And let the sun shine freely down
At times it looked like it wouldn't
But the plant came to flourish
Now it's standin' on solid ground
(Chorus 2X)

Sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head above the ed if I could be

The sun rises like water up in my eyes
I'm watchin' changing times but like a changing tide
Tryna to keep my head up
Above the ed if I could be
Least
If I may

Ego Trip By Nikki Giovanni,Nia,1999,"I was born in the congo
I walked to the fertile crescent and built
The sphinx
I designed a pyramid so tough that a star
That only glows every one hundred years falls
Into the center giving divine perfect light
I am bad
I sat on the throne
Drinking nectar with allah
I got hot and sent an ice age to europe
To cool my thirst
My oldest daughter is nefertiti
The tears from my birth pains
Created the nile
I am a beautiful woman
I gazed on the forest and burned
Out the sahara desert
With a packet of goat's meat
And a change of clothes
I crossed it in two hours
I am a gazelle so swift
So swift you can't catch me
For a birthday present when he was three
I gave my son hannibal an elephant
He gave me rome for mother's day
My strength flows ever on
My son noah built new/ark and
I stood proudly at the helm
As we sailed on a soft summer day
I turned myself into myself and was
Jesus
Men intone my loving name
All praises All praises
I am the one who would save
I sowed diamonds in my back yard
My bowels deliver uranium
The filings from my fingernails are
Semi-precious jewels
On a trip north
I caught a cold and blew
My nose giving oil to the arab world
I am so hip even my errors are correct
I sailed west to reach east and had to round off
The earth as I went
The hair from my head thinned and gold was laid
Across three continents
I am so perfect so divine so ethereal so surreal
I cannot be comprehended except by my permission
I mean...I...can fly
Like a bird in the sky...",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-ego-trip-by-nikki-giovanni-lyrics
Do This My Way,Nia,1999.0,"I be the first ever Asian astronaut
Blastin' off, castin' off
The ties that bind like a smashed guitar
Rode a mastodon out Jurassic Park
Chased by a fan in a Tyrannosaur mask
Trampled the traffic cop
Past the spot
Where the ostrich got all props for the ocelot
What I couldn't have bought
'Cause they wouldn't a popped it y'all
Just for me to cop it one
So I had to be up
I'm going gradually up
Into the galaxy bus
Until I can't feel my lungs
I pass the family of
Sea anemones plus
Saw the anatomy of
A cast of ballerinas

Now I was walkin' down this one block
Didn't hear a gun shot
Smellin' hella nature
Pickin' fruit off of a kumquat
Tree,
 
another day up in this life under the sun
spot
Light upon my innervision,
 
searchin' for an unsought
Territory,
 man-in-glory, days of the mental fury
Inventory took and while I raise rain began to pour
From the verbal dance I did amaze all the natives
And the ladies said ""You're crazy, would you love to have my baby?""
And I blaze with the chief of the Mohicans and the Sheikh
And travelled everywhere from Delaware way up to Mozambique
Was givin' praise with the Deacon at the steeple
Spirit-seekin' on the weekend with a tea can and a pair of old shades

It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
Ain't shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes, it's a mutual thing
'Cause it's the root of all things, and we aim to be

To be the venomous instrumentalist, syllable, mystic man, traveller
Skippin' through the bricks on a Wednesday into a city plaza
Tryna make a 20 out of 15 pennies on the avenue
The cold-hearted world creepin' on my destiny like salamanders
Enchanters, 'cause I'm on that goose and I be the gander
Cleanin' out the digestive tract of hip-hop like cranberries
Shinin' like amber
All of the children told me ""Damn you're an
Answer to our ears and deadly threat to peers like cancer""
On Prancer, on Comet, on Cupid, I'm Santa
Got more flow than Flo Jo,
 I laugh Ho Ho Ho, 
got Jo Jo Dancer
Punchlines,
 I'm a crunch time 
counselor,
 and a one-time champion for it
A hundred lifetimes in the hereafter, and for the reincarnation transform
What the heck I come back for?
Gotta handle chores now, and discuss all of that with God afterwards

We gon' bobsled off the Himalayas
With a bottle of bop-shoo-bop blended with Baileys
And a big ol' box of the latest compilations
And then we won't stop 'til we hit the Appalachians
To the Bullets Bargain Basement
Then 'cross the Baltic ocean basin
The ride 'cross that Oakland Bay Bridge
A drop deposit in the tropic Caymans
Makin' cakes that taste like theacrine
Bacon, eggs, potatoes, raisins
Plaintains, M&Ms, peanuts, grape juice
I'm savin' my pay checks to get my plane fixed, why's that?
We goin' fly all night, stop the propellors and
Jump out of the side with 
umbrellas
 and
Land smack-dab on backs of caterpillars that
Take us to the top the Himalayas

It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing
When I can do it my way
Ain't shootin' no blanks
I just refute what you think
A quite unusual thing
Yes, it's a mutual thing
'Cause it's the root of all things, and we aim

A lot of people follow 
shallow fellows,
 hollerin' indeed
About to lead 'em all to battle upon the bottom of the beat
And plant a seed of thought that sproutin'
Like a balance like a teeter-totter
Seen a lot of freedom bound to feet and 'bout to beat the drama

Now he began to 
Until the nurse, the passengers had grabbed his shirts
And nothin' happened, assured the captain and the person
But the pressure had expanded, and inertia burst, the cabin burst
And all 'em burgers, blankets, rations, animals and drinks
They flew out

Fleet of lots of band
Climb upon the wall like Peter Parker
Meter of the creed of darker regions,  season
Oh but these are not the reasons for the grief
And now proceed to outer-reaches
How to keep the styles from seepin' outta me

They flew out, the fuselage had blew its top
It’s do or die, the altitude would take a dive into the ground
Now if you'd have thought of suicide
If you would try but you would tie
A parachute onto a slide and took a dive
Now who's alive?

It's such a beautiful thing
This musical thing

Blacka,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"""I am the only one that can cure the world by speaking words. Blacka, the Almighty!""

Blacka than a Panther
, 
blacka than Atlanta
Open like the starry dark background of Saturn
Mighty like the builders of the pyramids in Africa
Stronger than an Afro, larger than Alabama
Deeper than your soul, blacka than a black Santa
Wild as Larry Davis is when he can give a damn or a fuck
Motion like a slave ship, slicker than a
Pimpin' hoe gettin' dough, slicker than the Mack or
Superfly,
 
flyer than a super fly anthem
Funky like 
good times
, 
soul train
, or 
what's happenin'
Darker than a random check of passengers
 traveling
First class, 
blacka than a President
, 
well half of him
Rise like the death rate, hustle like the trappers and
Slingin' like the crack, move weight like drug traffickin'
Vicious like the red and blue who don't see the aftermath
All that's left on the flag is white after the sabotage
Blacka than midnight in Kuwait and Afghanistan
Calmer than Caucasians in the booth gettin' tanner than
Aborigines
, Black like original man, expand
Through the circle drifting in the sky where God planted men
In his own image holdin' up The Ten Commandments
African like Christ, the Bible said he had skin
The color of bronze, hair of wool, blacka than a than
Fore father named Abraham who expanded men
Dope like P.E., BDP, Poor Righteous Teachers
X Clan and Brand Nubian combined in one rapper then fed
Pig's feet, ham, ribs, not one but a slab of them
To die inside the ghetto only to arise and rap again


Blacka than Marcus Garvey and Black Nationalism
Rippin' the drum beats
Rippin' the funk, rippin' the rhythm
Bringing the Jazz, R&B, Blues
Harder than prison
Yard populations with no rehabilitation is given
I am the seat on the bus that Rosa Parks was sittin' in
I am Timbuktu, they want to keep me hidden
Black as a mother of civilization, a black woman
First should be last
So black is a beginning and the ending
Black as an African emblem
Blacker than blacker than blacker than blacker than Infinite
Blacks in a grassroots rally assembling
Unifying together trying to make a little difference
Blacka than the blackest of fists
Displayed in array on the back of your pic
Everyday come parlay and kick back as I rip
Put your hands in the mist
This is Blackalicious",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-blacka-lyrics
Alpha and Omega,Imani Vol. 1,2015,"Sentimental energy the rhythm is a little freedom
For the city in the streets I felt a little bit of heat
They ridiculed the weak they never really getting sleep
I’m clever with it silly people I’m forever going to reek
Having me feeling like this is elementary
For an elevated celebrated decorated G on these beats
Never waiting I'll forever fade emcees
Tell them 87’s grey and in hell and can’t even speak
Say my name my name my name
I make you say the play rhymes with
The way a second grader looks with a paper and a crayon
As I peek I relax into a state of wake and sleep
And I never show no signs of giving up on the streets
Then another fella telling a hell of lyric for his follow
And get a little bit of hell because if you are ever willing to
To be better than the Alpha melon terror instigator
Dwelling in the middle of the elevated-melanin-propelled OG

Alpha and omega from the beginning to the end
The first, the last present, and the past
The future say again
Alpha and omega from the beginning to the end
The first the last present and the past
The future say again

A flow addictive like heroin hard to maintain your girl
Show no shame she only want to bang bang dog
Understandable the way we slang things
Big bang theory we clearly guilty of killing them all
Punks down to one so I’m cutting the nothings
Into to small chunks and the base drop it like a rock
They been beheaded for what they said was legit
And for that they got their head inconsiderately chopped off
Sorry everyone they wanted like John Gotti talk shit
Be the next body to shout about this shotty burnt hot
Cause i be corrupt rupt or will be the part of the days
Of the taurus faster than ferrari keep up
The little money it's like chop chop karate
Stretch you out like pilates
This beat'll move your body
Whether the DJ's spinning or surfing up on Safari
The brand's synonymous with quality
Quannum apocalypse


Quannum is the moniker the rap Kurt Vonnegut
Japanese, Jewish, and Italian call me Wyatt Earp
Samurai with the yarmulke and a silencer
Blow you full of holes like a colander, a ???
Charlie Manson  meets Charlton Heston meets Jim
Henson meets Carlton meets Manson
Oh question incidentally without Quannum
Would y'all even know how to do this independently?
Pure Berkeley stock but I don't wear Birkenstocks
You got something for me baby, boil me up
Invested in ideas to change the world an entrepreneur
Y'all the best lyricists in the world, that's a crock of manure
Don't push it, partner
Earning in my sleep I got pockets in my pajamas
Still rotten and obnoxious still arriving unconscious but stylin'
Still bossing still Quannum Projects",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-alpha-and-omega-lyrics

Now Gabby got the verbal
That'll get your little wifey out her girdle
In a session with me lightn' up a little herbal
Turtle shell
School individuals that listen to me
Word it well
Given to the rapper who is livin' through
Be heard and held in a high esteem
I get you drunker than your bourbon, ale, liquor, malt
My assault, learned it well
Turn the tables of time with my perception
Building staples of rhyme hear my reflections
""On a little"" life I'm livin' in a universe with no beginning to it
So it ain't an ending and at times I get to diggin' into infinite subliminably spirited
A nigga with a gift and send it riveted from any
An indigenous stork has just touched ground
Rappers' organizations get shut down
Not that I don't wanna see my brothers succeed
But rap is like a sport, I dominate, so follow my lead
I be the G-I-F-T, test me hefty, left's be gettin' swung
Cruise like a jet ski
Up in yo apartment and plop on your couch y'all

lime to a lemon,
 fat rhymes, I assemble them
At times when I'm driven they shine, you remember
When divine forces within refine men and women
And I rhyme for a livin', not just for the scrilla
Man that isn't what it's all about, really now, valid clout
Bougie MCs I have arguments and fallin' outs with
About what it's all about, ain't about foamin' out the mouth
Like a walkin' tall can of Guinness Stout
Mad dog will shine when the battle cries soundin'
Ding-ding, hit 'em like bing-bing
Eat 'em like Peking duck with no seasoning, bee sting
With yo girl dressed in a G-string, she's swingin'
My way shorty and it sure looks good
I'm cookin up a batch of dopeness like a good cook should
I be the jack of trades, rappers pray
That I don't decapitate, half of they cashless asses
At an irate rate
Grade-A, top-choice lyricism
Hey, hit me with that shell shocked rhythm
One time for the funky rhymes I say
Two times for the beat and for my DJ

Blacka back again attack a MC actor
Venom factor in ya send ya to attempt your rap again
Rappers get in accidents these sacrilegious after thoughts
Are lackin' I will smack 'em but this thrashin' is a master cleanse
Soak up in it dope, I been it
Potent, centered, I deliver
Opuses you dope as us?
You must be smoking dust in cigar blunts
Hit our dope is healthier
You'll live more months and years
Competition is none within our circumference it's clear
Now time to get her done for citizens
And anyone that's listening my rhythm stuns
Your little uninventive shit is done
Come learn a little wisdom little ones
Get turned up with precision get a ton of inner shit
Begin your trip to vision
Uncharted, come start it
Run forward one word at
A time it's so funky in here you think somebody farted!
Come forward unorthodox style
You think the floor would
Come crashing in from after
When these raps have christened your hood!

We on fire tonight! (x3)
We on fire tonight! (x3)
A-Come on!
We on fire tonight! (x3)
With a 9-to-5
Or behind the mic
For the prize no lie
We will ride or die
FIYAH!

Burn the scene to flames turn to me and say
Heard you be obeying your thirst
When you burst MC's with flames
Keep your dang little comments to yourself
And you might just see the same
I am the Heat Miser, miser of heat
My heat will reign
Seek and keep your lane
The lane I'm in is an illegal lane
Keep your sane thoughts
I'm insanity you don't want to see no pain
Be your way I'm me forever I don't really see no way
I'll conform to what is hot presently
I'll rather keep my range
I'll seek this strange patterns
Range Rovin' up in your brain
With mathematical radical sabbatical
Agile talent that'll battle you lames
After you came you left with a lost of breath
And stabbings and pains
In your neck and chest from when the rest
Of the gathering was trampling away at ya
The whole place burned down to ashes and decay
And you looked back in awe
To the flames rising in a massive array
As I stood there on stage alone
After the blazing inferno that happened
All because lyrically a precedent had to be made

We on fire tonight! (x3)
We on fire tonight! (x3)
We on fire tonight! (x3)
Feel high as a kite
If you arrive with spite
J.J Evans with the rhythm flash dynamite
We designed it right
When it's time to fight
For the kind of light
When you're shining bright
With a 9-to-5
Or behind a mic
For the prize no lie
We will ride or die

As I embark on life's journey from the point where I'm at
Peace to everyone I know or who I go way back wit
Every pimp every mack, every gangsta to jack
Every hustler feedin babies, anybody pro-black
Every sister raisin kids without the help of a dad
Wantin for they children all the things that they never had
All the brothers handlin business even though shit's hard
Wakin up at five A.M., holdin down three jobs
All my rasta brethern gettin insight from trees
To my brothers up in college gettin Ph.D's
Or any other degree, even if you just read
For mental health, see you're concious that your mind is free
All my people locked down, for your past mistakes
Mentally and spiritually, dwellin past the gates
You could change your ways, elevate today
To all recovered alcoholics chillin up in AA
Every black-owned business, keep doin for self
Helpin out the community and spreadin the wealth
Understand that help ain't gonna come from nowhere else
Revolutionaries makin the unjust get dealth wit
Head on black people got to meet the task
Educate, keep learnin, gotta question, ask!
And let your light keep shinin and remember the past
By any means necessary, we'll be free at last

See your troubles as a blessin and you're homeward bound
Everybody gotta struggle, that's the way of the world
Can't develop biceps if you don't do curls
Can't achieve a a garden if you never water your crops
If you never paid your dues, then you don't get props
Couldn't eat a proper meal without cookin it first
Can't receive a paycheck if you don't do work
If it wasn't for the rain, then the trees won't grow
When the spring came around, what a sight to bestow
When you face adversities, dark clouds won't last
If you never study, how do you expect to pass?
The grasshoppers laid around while the ants did chores
When the winter came around, he was left outdoors
See the cycle keeps moving like a big machine
Evolution of the mind, soul body and being
God'll never put upon you more than you can take
Sometimes you even gotta learn from OTHER people's mistakes
So head on black people got to meet the task
Educate, keep learnin, gotta question, ask!
And let your light keep shinin and remember the past
By any means necessary, we'll be free at last

Nowhere Fast,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"Now you, who ever you are
As you're listening to what I'm going to say
Will probably not want to believe what I'm going to tell you
And there isn't any way in which I can make you believe;
I can only state the facts as they are
And hope that you will really believe me

Hey yester-day you were supposed to meet me
Now I got to testify
I waited hours for you guess that all was just a lie
Quick as you stepped inside soon enough you said good bye
""Peace out! I'm gone and won't be back!""
I heard your echo cry
Oh how the seconds fly left without a second try
I check and try to recollect how I just let you die
And now I wallow in these severed ties

Of yesterday

Of yester-day girl you're really gone
I guess that's how it just should be
I had big plans for us today but now you're history
Today's a mystery you took pieces I miss of me
I keep on diggin deep tryin to find that kid in me
We had some really good discussions back then didn't we?
Befriended me but now we don't speak like we're enemies
And all I got is memories

Of yesterday

But Yester-day memories are priceless
And I'm really glad you left em
They're etched inside
I take a ride when driftin through the spectrum
It's just at times I dwell and dwell and then I have to catch up
To now while back in time
It ceased to march it and just kept on
I want you back I want you back when it was here I slept on
What I appreciate a little more now as a blessing
Now I'm complaining and regretting

About yesterday

And I'm just goin' nowhere fast

I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent

You're stuck in a flurry of illusions goin' nowhere fast

I am today I'm all that was and ever is and uh
It is an honor, don't become a mental prisoner
Just listen to the now and keep your mind from driftin' off
I am the mission, the position of this instance a
New opportunity to get the love you're wishin' for
To kick the door in to look for your ambitions, what?
You can move on out to elevate your existence up

Today

I'm just today, I'm just the way I am
I am ever single day I am
I'm February, April, March and even May I am
I'm only what you make me hope I'm what you pray I am
Today I am, I'm never really far away I am
You better scope me like the hunter does the prey I am
You play ""I am"" out in the picture yes today I am
I'm everything your memories say I am

Today

So seize me, I'm here to serve you if you serve me back
It's easy, but difficult that's time alone will squeeze me
From beaming your feet when all your actions turn to banking
An inkling, a hint, I'm moving faster than you're blinking
So treat me
To just a slice of heaven why you cheat me?
Deceive me and now I'm hell
Inside these thoughts that link me
To flesh the soul it's bound to I was truly made to be free

Today

Instead I'm going nowhere fast

I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent
I don't try to stay here
I just fly away here
Out of my oasis
I am not complacent

I'm only saying this to show how all around
Man or beast sleep away their gift of time
And never know the beauty of a good life below

Lyric Fathom,Melodica,1994.0,"(Gift Of Gab):
Rappers step to me like I'm a doormat
Check the format, I pour raps
Not your average everyday hardcore act actin'
I'm like a mac 10, a uzi and a AK-47
Rollin' with crazy kids like Bebe
Mayday mayday, I used to listen to KDAY in my heydays
I ride the bus with a dream of one day lampin' inside of a Mercedes
Benz with sheepskin interior
And two fifteens, and to rip means to get creamed
I'm large as a hippopotamus, trip, I gotta dis
Sip a bottomless cup of brew and I'm getting raw to this
If a rapper tries to step, I rip and slaughter his ass
Some shit, he oughta just swallow his pride and get to following this
I'm marvelous like Marvin Haggler in his prime
I carve kids like a dagger with my mind
I start shit with rappers who can't rhyme
I spark spliffs cuz I don't stagger when I'm high
But when I'm drunk I do, punk I do not acknowledge wackness
I gotcha grandma doin' backflips and tumbles
I rumble in the jungle with Ali and Frasier
Call me the savior of hip hop
I rip shop and get my propers
Come get with this ak, my style is akwards
I never mock words, I talk towards the inner city youth
Revealing it, the truth
I'm feeling that the proof is in the pudding
I put men that would end hip hop in my shop and I torture
Chorus:
Check out my lyric fathom
Check it brothers, really, check it out
(Gift Of Gab):
As I walk through the jungle with a knife on my ankle
Taking lives, skip will shank you lyrically
Apparently niggas wanna sleep still
Keep still, I'm packin' the a heap of skills
I'm rhyming to keep an ill mind, Saddam type shit
Your arm might get snapped like a twig
Rap like a nig-gero possessed thorough
The astonishing mission, dishing pain
Fishing in brains, plain lynching niggas bitchin'
So take a ride, I'd abide by my rules
Cuz fools I had duels with, I left them in the pool pit, I rule kids
I'm a kamikaze bomb, drop a nigga with an arsenal of drama in my rhymes
With the tracks and backs and heads is broken to pieces
Rapture's phat, ya dead, ya croaked
I wrote this piece as just a little dedication
To the rappers on the other level
Budded out and looking into space, a new frontier
And I can probably bet cha that we got anything you want here
Cuz punk, we're the crew that make you cheer
The two that make you fear and send you back to the rear
We're here
CHORUS
(Gift Of Gab):
I flip and I rip shit, I'm whippin' a dipshit
With the lyrical form, I did kick it slick
I'm gifted, I'm ripping a nitwit to shreds
Get the Feds to arrest me for slaughtering emcees
That's right, on my testicles
Come get a little array of the skill supreme
Wanna defeat me? My nigga, you should kill the dream
The noise, the boys, the count, everybody
When I drop fat styles that ain't your simple blahzay blah
Lodi Dodi average Joe Simpleton with a average flow
Have to go after you jugular
Then shit gets uglier
Man I hope you take heed
I'm making brain cells bleed an excess amount of hemoglobin
I rap, yes I'm out to see you bobbin' ya noggin'
I've been gobblin' niggas talkin' shit like Haagen-Dazs
Stompin' 'em, mobbin' with the ill ass skill as seen
On individuals who fiend for the real shit

I only want one million to buy this record",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-lyric-fathom-lyrics

Eating your readings and pens bleeding intense feeling
Appealing sentence in dents in just reeling 'em in
I'm merely a chameleon amid your elementary
Elements of the century tell 'em that it was me that sent ya
Tell 'em eventually they'll be in to me until they sleep
But hell I'm an entity bailin' wailin' and tell em I'm free
Millin' and rousin' and I'm (rollin' and killin'?) from filtering
Hell of intelligent diligent heaven-sent benevolent relevant medicine
Poetry pedestrian peddelin' mad adrenaline to lyrical gentlemen

You're not gone' be the same when our flow reach your brain
It's 'bout to bust

Not your crush, show up at our show in a tacky dress
Hawking us, talking 'bout your prowess but we're not impressed

In your face (and your mental) hear the taste

Give hella gratefulness for the blessin' to share this and fly
Everywhere people outside the culture now try to deFINE

Vicious vindictive and mental prisons from within the mind
Sit and I find stillness from minutes is written the RHYME

Help this little MC find his way home
Wake up in the morning with the microphone jones
Step up in the room puff-puff the homegrown
All up in my zone prone stoned a drone's a clone
Television's inner vision native's are home
Most ill-in-tray innovative lo-'n-behold
Penetrating in the winebago goin' to Rome
Send a tape in when I break it though I be wrong
Hope this statement make ya planet keep flowin' along
But you never want to try to challenge for that throne
Make your dome piece shatter make you go back home
Here to show that bro
In this world of disco, sippin' on a cup of cisco
Know that go
To the psyche, make me pyscho, then I throw that blow
Lotta killin' lotta dyin' and I know that's wrong
Show backbone on rap songs, no wack song
Alimony's trippin' sittin' all in the back row
Mack-mode style sizzle hot tabasco
Slappin' up your class ill-y-ask fiasco
Last call for MC's who have soul
Aspiring to elevate cause niggas is ass wrong

I got this whole map sold, you didn't know that though

Bomb-diddy put the beat in yo' head
Watch as it expands an' your face turn red
Put lead to me like laps at club dread
Hate 'em need 'em leave but passports are dead

Whiping out the webs in the heads of my bretheren
Exiting to hover over your opinion
Never let another ruler inside of my dominion
Center in the middle of my inner with a riddle
Smoke a penner put a little bit of ginger in my dinner meal
Feeling ill stealing the show like a criminal
Cleaning out the mucus in your grill like benadryl
Millenium man, lyrically battle any man
Go and get your posse and your crew I got plenty fam
I roll up in your entourage with a caravan
Thought that I was humble then I let out the arrogance
Anti-American government crisis
Stare into my eyes don't you see you can never win
Hit you like a javelin severin helluva intelligent MC's
And victory relevant
You didn't know that though
Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo Yo
Blast off
Make me look every way that's surrounding me
Break your sound up into rhyme colonies
Reproduce and reduce the economy
Fill your ear with self sight psychology
In the world plan with spirituality
On the road sidelines enough casualties
Mind and body soul whole mathematically
Grab the microphone rock on emphatically

We Did It Again,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"Once upon a time reality was black and white
Couldn't fit in with the younger kids and parties after nightfall
Felt like they was gave instructions how to handle life
While I felt my way through darkness and I didn't have a light y'all
Then I felt a thing a thing something that would ignite all
Energy within above my head appeared a light-bulb
Soon enough the mic called
Soon enough the night club
Gathered as I rapidly knew that I found the right one
Slice some dice some rappers falling like some
Dominoes but I don't know to me this shit is like fun
Got into a love affair and music is my wife done
Took me on a journey deeper than the sewage pipes run
Now and then some might come frontin' like the light gone
Dimmer till the inner forces inside me deliver one more nice one
Feel how fresh and new it is again
Get a glimpse after this we'll be doin' it again

We did it again
Just living in the dream
Giving all to make it happen
We did it again
Still shining til it's done
But the story has only
Just begun

I can give it to you raw or give it to you fly
So eccentric with the penmanship unlimited supply
Intricate with this I spit the gift a lyric driven guy
I've been sentenced to this bid since I was just a little guy
In my infant crib working hard to elevate my penmanship
Out with all the garbage rappers with no talent in with this
When it comes to lyricism it begins and ends with this
Every time they try to cut us out we send them into bliss
This music love affair is infinite
My mental is
Not meant to drift away I'm in your home and on your internet
All in your head you can't escape
My flow is falling in
So when this is done we'll take a break and do it all again

We did it again
Just living in the dream
Giving all to make it happen
We did it again
Still shining til it's done
But the story has only
Just begun
We did it again
We did it again

Every time you think we finished, then we doin' it again
Doin' it to win
Blackalicious, who is it but them
True it is intuitive and you are losin' it with them
Rhymes infusing with the music get me lucid with the pen
Using rhythm too original infinite kinda MC
Up in your mind again see I'm finna try to end
The career of rappers who do not identify with them
That are getting high up in the sky and spitting flyer gems
It is Gift and I am him
My intent I invent
Violence for you suckas die and then die again
So you can not rhyme again
Silence violins play
I grin as they enter the grave they lie up in
Call me king or sire when I ascend I avenge music
Seasoned like a hymn I be spewin' it like venom
It's stupid to pretend you could do it like we been
Doin' doin' it
We doin' it, we doin' it again

We did it again
Just living in the dream
Giving all to make it happen
We did it again
Still shining til it's done
But the story has only
Just begun
We did it again
Just living in the dream
Giving all to make it happen
We did it again
Still shining til it's done
But the story has only
Just begun

Cliff Hanger,Nia,1999,"""Whole house freeze!""
It was a Thursday. I stepped in the club. There she was
Draped in a burgundy dress, silhouetted superbly
Curved indeed. She started staring in my direction
Luring and urging seductively
Body language instructing me
I offered her a drink instead she took a cup of tea
And then I lied about my luxury lifestyle
And I said ""So who you be? You looking kind of tight, gal
I would love to see you in a nightgown""
She said ""They call me the Dragon Queen and I come from Tibet
I'm calm in the face of pressure and you'll never see me sweat
I've come to your country in search of a lost Scroll
That contains directions to a hidden village comprised of gold""
I looked at her confused and said ""But why have you told me this?""
She said the description that I fit
Was that of the Chosen One who'd go beyond
Then slipped a concoction in my drink
That immediately set my consciousness adrift...
Now I'm in that zone dwelling. I woke in a warehouse tied to a chair
With an abundance of flare surrounding me in a circular angle
Glared up at the Dragon Queen's Lair, and wasn't imagining a thing
Her steps on the stairs had a magic gleam, glowed brightly
To prepare me for my journey, a Sword was hovering towards me
Plus garlic from the Keepers of the Gate who bore all the secrets and take
Care of trespassers, but at last it's prophesized that I would gain
Access to a cultural dynasty buried and seize and capture the Scroll
Massive helicopters patrolled the rooftops, strapped in
Began travelling into the darkness, knew not of what awaited
I thought of a way to get out of it, just then the bottom gave way
I began falling and gave it ten seconds, pulled the cord on my parachute
Landed surrounded by a herd of wild barracudas, lions
The sounds of the wild kingdom piercing like a siren
Was I entering near the mortal life span's end?
Defiantly I stood boldly as they began closing in
Time seemed to be moving rapidly just then...
""Whole house freeze!""
Just then I pulled the Sword and somehow
It affected all the creatures as they stepped back and bowed
And the same Glow that I seen in the Sword I seen in the eyes of the Lion
Who began leading me in a specific direction as if trying to tell me something
Just over the horizon, the same creatures who had been described
Appeared in statue form, but their eyes scoped
And as I approached the gate they began to break open and cried
""AFTER YEARS WE HAVE FINALLY BEEN AWAKENED!""
The assault was on, I got knocked to the ground by one
Shocked in an unorthodox form boxing
Throwing an abnormal proportion of body blows, karate chops
And drop kicks, plunged struggling deep within the swamp
Then I grabbed my Sword, the garlic put it around my neck
Saw that it was draining all of their energy and then with a swing
Off with their heads!
The gates slowly and mysteriously opened
Curiously I moseyed in with intensity focusing on my objective
Spider webs the size of king-size beds
Fell in a secret passage not knowing to where it led
Just then the same Light beamed brightly and in the distance
At that instance, lo and behold, The Hidden Scroll!
And just as I thought my mission was over
I could feel the Dragon Queen breathing heavily over my shoulder
As she began to transform and metamorphosize
She took on an assortment of legs, arms, heads and eyes
And sprouted two horns and then began to breathe fire
So once again, I grabbed my trusty Sword, but to my astonishment
She burned it to a crisp, turned and grasped the Scroll
And exited much faster than the secreted gas. I'm gasping
Clasp full of flames cast in my direction
I saw my whole life flash and the possibility of death
And a casket passed into the ground, pound for pound, astounding
How could I survive and last another round inside this madness?

Young leaders, little unsung heroes
You can run some meters, be a hoop or a track star
School teacher, scientist, or even
Own your very own street, maybe even be a rap star
Times witcha, you could change whole pictures
Make a better situation, for your mother and yo' big mama
Make dollars, own a ride and a house
Get it right, use your powers, getting' everything you did want
Then the youth say, ""Look at where I'm at now
Straight poverty, death is in my backyard
Dope dealers, get fifty G's a pack
While my teacher don't really give a damn about a black child!
The grown folks say, 'tell the truth', then act foul
Say 'no' to drugs, hidin' all they crack vials
And talk all about peace and love and God
But then why are we at war, killin' people in Iraq now?""


Young sista had a child, still young herself now
And it's others all around screamin' turmoil
Ain't done wit' school, how are you gonna make it now?
Life is gonna be a little harder for you girl
Some how, she sees the face of a child
And on her face is a smile, and now it's brighter up in her world
And makes her stronger now, she's gotta carry on
And be a very good mama, this is life, let it unfurl
And she's doin' it, mother of the earth now
Found a blessin' in the struggle through her first child
Kept goin', kept growin', kept flowin'
Kept strivin', kept knowin' God would make a way somehow
Live yo' life, girl, show 'em how it's done now
I believe in you, so keep it movin' 'til the sun's down
Never let them hold you back from anything you want now
Life is but a ride, so find the treasures that are unfound


Young brotha, takin' care of his mother
Makin' bread, gotta hustle, cause the table's lookin' thin now
Stress ridden as he walks his little sister
To her preschool, which is up the road just a few miles
Back at the house, his mom seeks magic
Through the pipe smoke travelin' through her lungs out and back down
Worst part that breaks the young man's heart
Is he's the one that's supplyin' it, he feels like he's trapped now
Cause every time he says, ""No"", then she'll spaz out
Start shakin', ""Mama, please, where is dad now?!""
Guess he's gotta be the home's only man now
Left the life alone and gotta whole other plan now

Side to Side,The Craft,2005.0,"When you first walked in and I saw you at the bar or somethin'
I ain't really wanna holler or nothin'
I just pegged you as the type for frontin'
Steady chucklin' with your girlfriends actin' contrary and cluckin'
But ya song came on, and somethin' changed in the way she was movin' along
Eyelashes caught flashes of the possibilities, maybe this one is the one for me
She's movin' to the dance floor, we'll see
What I seen was inspirational, highly motivational
Had to maneuver the set, up to confrontationals
Even though it was my chance to mack
I already did my dance, had the reservoir tapped
Hit me like a thunder clap, though
Can't let somethin' that fat pass BY, why asks why?
Made my way through the crowd with the side to side
Then I pushed up on the tush cause, uh, I ain't shy!
Said, ""Excuse me Miss, but I liked what I saw""
When she spoke, I damn near dropped my jaw!
HELL NAW! I can't believe she SAID that shit!
I need to call my sister
Come up through and check this chick!
And put some sense in her, cause her IQ 'bout six
Bein' that, stu-pid in pub-lic there should be a law against
I mean, she didn't have a CLUE, tell you what to do
Just SHUT UP, ride the groove, and let's move now

Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two

When I stepped into the coliseum, I was slidin' through
Just bein' me, lovin' the space and lettin' everything be free
And bein' free to 'til I seen her, me, I popped up, solutions
Could it be? She was the one that could make me a believa?
Step through the crowd like a bobber and a weaver
Couldn't really see the crowd, all that I could see was HER
Looked directly in her eyes, all that I could see was blurred vision
Couldn't really tell if she was prime and ready furr pickin'
She was downin' that 'Yac in straight shots
Offered me a drink, I told her I was tryin' to stop
I thought to reconsider mackin', then she pulled off her top
And yelled, NEXT THING I KNOW, SHE WAS DOIN' THE WOP
She said, ""Gabby, Gabby, Gabbyyy, you need to come and swig""
I said, ""I think I'm cool, you need to find another nigga""
Baby, baby, baby PLEASE, then she dropped down to her KNEES
Then I had to leave, I didn't want to contract diseases
I said, ""Don't take it personal, I think you need Jesus
You're movin' kinda fast, you need to stop and just breathe""
Hopin' she would get a clue, tell you what to do
Just SHUT UP, ride the groove and let's move, now..

Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two

As soon as I walked in the DO'-woe-woe
The rati-o was in favor of me, cause as far as I could see
All the bitties on the FLO'-woe-woe
Was movin' in such a way in the heat, kinda made me wanna pee
Leavin' ME wanting MO'-woe-woe
But I was scared, of major defeat, cause I saw the girl Lateef
Was dancin' with sayin' NO-woe-woe
And Gab was wrestlin' with a freak who was topless
I was intimated to SHOW, any interest at ALL
I just stood still, pressed against the walllll (that's when I saw her)
Time froze, the ice around my heart e-RODED
Glasses she looked like a spy, wanna decode it
I said, ""My name is Pi-Pi-Pigeon Johnny""
Stuttered a little bit, felt like a big DU-mmy
She said I didn't have a clue, she told me what to do -
She said, ""SHUT UP and ride the groove""
I said, ""Okay"", like..

Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two now
Side to side to side, times two

If you gonna be creative, y'know
You're ultimately offering yourself as a sacrifice
A sacrifice of, channeling something, bigger than yourself
And existing here at the same time, y'know
Being measured upon your words
When you're channeling yourself at higher than your state
Is a pre' serious, jump to take on
So, if they truly about, the word
Poetry, singing, writing, and drawing and painting
Or however it is, then y'know
Want us to realize we're here to record ripples of divinity, y'know
Ripples of mathematics, that's really what you're dealing with...",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-side-to-side-lyrics
Passion,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"{Cuts by Chief Xcel and DJ Babu}
An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest MCs out there
(Chorus)

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights, to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

Propaganda, positive propositions
A, politician, musician and a 
triple optician
Still, part of my mission's to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without plaques, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-in
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane,
 
lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Run into the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga ride, nigga ride..
(Chorus)

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights, to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

Desire, the fire that inspires
I don't state facts, I state buildings, like empires
Passion

The journey, the learnin', the time-turnin'
The searchin', the mind yearnin' to wake and find morning
Passion

The ladies they love the long-lasting
Asking for action? Brace for satisfaction
Passion

The black-skinned African jazz-men of the half in Aspen
Relaxed, gettin' my back rubbed

I'm still here, I've seen cats get killed here
I've seen cats make a mil but millionaires still fear
You can buy air play but you can't buy cheers
Blackalicious, Dilated, vibratin' your ears

Sent vibrations for years, I've been waiting for years
I've been patient for years, we ain't playin' this year
We hold stake in this here, it ain't safe for this year
We in the zone watch next level, takin' it there, this is
(Chorus)

Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights, to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through

Soul-
New seeds of wisdom, craft, and skill

Listen now, to this classic moment from-
DJ's, around the world, DJ's around the world

Had a rough weekend, got beat by passion
Saddled up, tweaked off a beat, started mashin'
Matador Rica, the heat from the heater
Inner world dwellin', hear the world
Yellin' for a leader

I don't bother with the dealers, I take it to the lab
It's Rakaa chillin' with Babs, Xcel, Gift of Gab
I grab mics and fans gravitate, I can't waste it
My whole life, I wanted it so bad, I could taste it

Brain Washers,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"Tryin' man I'm tryin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
Where do I go, where do I go?
Tryin' yes I'm strivin' lies and lies ain't buyin'
How does it go?

Walk, to a time when minds was one
Came into creation as itself, mankind was born
Step into the eye of the storm, survive as pawn
Casualties of evil men, slidin' the blinders on
Lies will spawn, hey are you conscious what side you're on?
Is the total story told or is it they hide you from?
Why are we on the brink of murderin' more innocent
Now it's like, we're patriotic and so militant
Get ya ride on, rise on, take a look
They done even takin' righteous laws, rewrote the books
To benefit the prize they got they eyes on
Minds run rampant, truth to be revealed when the proper time comes
Brainwashers

Brainwashers
It's when you think how they wanna think
Speak how they wanna speak, Livin' in defeat
When you don't wanna question what they teach, as the truth
With no proof, with the fear of burnin' in eternal heat
When you're programmed not to be your own man, but a sheep
Bein' herded as they word it, so your thinkin' ain't free
When you sleep in a deep sleep standin' on your feet
When you’re beat, makin' ends meet, while they in they seat
Now your labeled obsolete, workin' for elite beasts
In the heat on bare feet, smile showin' off your teeth
Good grief, it's berserk how they work it
And they jerk it while they serve us
The surface keep the circus underneath
The brainwashers
 (several times)

You just keep playing. Can you bring that level up in my earphones?
And you bring their level up in my chairs, cause I'm playing with sticks
And I'm drowning 'em out, so if you can give them more of this
Yeah, you can bring that in even more. Bring up
Yeah. You guys play. Yeah, that's perfect

Deep in the Jungle,Melodica,1994.0,"(Gift of Gab)
And I come like this
(scratched)
I've got a few things I wanna say
(Gift of Gab)
I'm gunnin', ya runnin away, do not stay
Cuz the wrath of the gift will be hittin' ya spliff
And a lot of the crews got sprayed and yelled, ""Raid!"", as struggle approaches
A brother'll flow this
Another ferocious jam, I smother the ?grossagran?
I hover above the land of lame emcees that dont blow
I'm poppin' the clip and then bo bo with the gun
And a once in a munch chest, rest in peace
In the bellly of the beast I abolish emcees with sounds like these
Run over enemies and I rest in the west
Dark hemisphere, burn with a fear is nothing but a mere setback
Hear when I'm here
Earn wit a clear conscience in the middle of the jet black
I'm a dog, running through the jungle
Wit a hoodie and black hat choppin down MCs
Not a frog, cunning yet I'm humble
Gotta do the jewels tack wack talkin clowns
Tip me, I'mma knock 'em all around, bust a front
With a fat blunt swinging on a vine in the homeland
I'm attack 'em in the sound little punks when the rap bump
Springing on the rhyme I bowl man
Gifted when I'm lifted off a spliff hit
Reminisce shit, riff with dipshits
This shit is the mischievous style of the gifted
I'm a whiz kid, get a whiff kid
Swingin' down low, breakin' down flows
With a new flow mentally outgrow when you step back
To the black with a fat rap with a fat sack
With a little bit a funk in my napsack
Take it back to the brother land
And I was smotherin' stupid idiots like Tarzan
Givin' back to the brother man and get another land
Man gimme it, its Or-land-o
Calrisian tight wishin' into the depths
Up in the sound in the heart of the jungle
Gettin' wild with the art of the rumble
Never amount to be smarter than Dumbo
Make 'em mumble, make 'em humble
Get me round from the start, you will crumble
And you tumble, and you stumble
And I do it like that
From the end to the other end never gonna end
Set a trend with the maniac mic clutch
Hey ?bob by the ba?, said you keep your day job
My competitors never know the right touch
Have to bail through the backstreets, raisin' hell to a black beat
Rappers fail to attack me, like a sail with the slack g
I attack 'em like acne, exactly UGH
(spoken)
Mindless cretins grow through idiosynchrosy
Peels up, rising up, down
(Lateef)
Steppin' up through the deep, dank murkiness
No telling what is lurking
I hero it, but will I sense a jerkin
I proceed to bust a buster
Cuz I trust the finer design in the mind of the rhyme
Just about impossible to find
What a disgrace to the race of wack mc's
I am because I choose to stand my ground
FIRM and blowin' the rhythm the vermin and learnin'
All I know is we've earned every entry attained
And strained the game, and what I'm tryin' to explain is that
The deeper we're creepin' the more we find sleepin'
And slippin' just shootin' dead lips on a mission
Its missin' the reason the gift we've been given the rhythm
Cuz that just the way we've been livin
And thrive in the essence, survive and its easy
To recognize when analyzing ?the bo?
Surprises the lame in this line and tryin'
To get you to buy into their fantasy world
Can it be damaged the ?emina? bones
Of the fellas and men thats exploting my culture
Can't understand every breast that you touch
Was as up ?paper scun? be one hung motherfucker
Such as nowadays, its fallin' and splinterin', just timber, instead of
Gettin out of my way, and what I'm -- meaning to say is that
The canopy that covers me now is the blackest, attack this
I thought we already established the wackness
Presented in the cemented jungle
By the bumblin' brothers stumblin' tumblin' down
Surround me in a cannibalistic style, but I just smile and
Silence 'em like the lambs, they all the whole flock
We just one magic stock style
I'm gettin' 'em off like crack viles, and wicked the whole fuckin while
Not trippin over no vines, or over no swine, or over no mines
Or over no line at the plot
Thinkin' of whippin' 'em like a Glock in the jungle
(spoken)
Now in the beginning of the journey
Not in time, but in the mind
Imagine the camels being loaded up
The men, loading themselves up
It's a long journey -- the oasis is all in the clamor
As we start from the top we go to the very bottom
Of a myserious place -- a very mysterious place
What's that I see? Ahhhh
(Lyrics Born)
I can't even describe you, so I ain't even gon' try...hmmmm
Making hell of mc Asia is now this I dont dispute but you knew
You knew Lyrics Born was a ripped off note sheet of a hundred
And you scrape the paint off your bumpers making sure you beat the buzzer
Making sure Lyrics Born came out his mother's stomach
Covered with the lyrics that kill
No bumper, right? Cuz mo'fucka
I know you can make colors rhyme
And have the whole goddamn planet yellin uncle at you and even
Still take the time big up little ?egg?, can you imagine?
Big up Asia Born, this little bottle
Or that you would even be lightly concerned with little, little words
That you would tug at the line, pullin' the kind
Of lyrics out my mouth that make me big bad don, takin' kids' legs home
You can't even back a sliver roach, you know
That type shit, and then watch me wreck this stage
Boy like I got your daddy's style hangin' around my waist
And then watch me forget -- the way
Good lyrics taste, thinkin' I just ain't little rabbit eyes in your heart
Man, cuz if I thought it was just
Lyrics Born that made lyrics born, lyrics born
And then suddenly I can't do no more, I'd be like
""Do you remember me?"" No, Asia
And you used to play my record on the way to the vapor",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-deep-in-the-jungle-lyrics

A true player who moves layers of earth

Intuitive just like Confucius in your next life
Or a new addition of a ludicrously vexed sniper
Pursuing moving units influence the next writers

Blooming and moving on in unison consuming the consumer

Purest Love,Blazing Arrow,2002.0,"One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
Was born in a small town called Pacoima, California
Where them gangstas bang ghetto life thuggin on the corner
Youngest child of six
When I came pops split with momma
Used to visit on weekends
Til he moved to the north side of Cali
14 he died, 15 my moms died
Alcoholic diabetic forces were my life too
Moved with my older brother taught me discipline
But I wasn't ready though still shocked and holding pain in
So I skipped school got F's got the posters on my wall
Taken down
No TV
Times I felt like ya'll ain't want me around
Set up in my room developing the mind of a loner
Writin rhymes rappin out my days instead of homework
Through it all my three sisters placed the place like one time
As I was like this rap thing is gonna pay
I know that I was right
But still set in my ways livin for better days
Until I die I'm startin if I'm broke or with that cheddar check
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
Purest purest
Purest purest
Purest purest purest purest!
Love
The two realest cats I know? My two older brothers
The most beautiful woman in the galaxy? My mother
The strongest black women raising kids alone? My sisters
The best part of my future is my present love interest
The most important time? Right now and ever after
The greatest expression is love, happiness, and laughter
See life is a book and this song is just another chapter
I'll stay down to earth and real if you speak I'll speak back
I'm not a preacher or a scholar I'm merely just a rapper
I probably don't fit in to the current state of -
- what you consider that to be
So you ask
How can I rap
If I ain't thugged out, pimpin'
Flossin' my ice
Packin' a gat
Man if this is what I got
I want dough I can't lie
But never sell my soul
And front inside of mainstream's eyes
The purest love is how I'm driven, sent, and reach for my goals
If nothing else I'll leave the world
Some songs that speak from the soul
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me
One precious love the purest thing
One precious love so good to me

Aight me too, let's meet back around 3
It was the crew and me we down in New Orleans
It's 10 o'clock the night is young we bout to do our thing
Far as the eye can see is people lots of brew and beads
We celebratin' it's a party poppin' true indeed
Met about 2 or 3 fine ladies who would be
Movin' they hips to all the rhythms very beautifully
This really suited me maybe a few would be
Liftin' they shirt unveilin' flesh for all of you to see
Hunger was movin' me, time for a fool to eat
I had some alligator and some rabbit stew at Leaks
I'm movin' lucidly I'm feelin' stupid free
I get a call I'm wondering ayo, who could this be?
(""It's Jumbo man, what's poppin' with you, how you doin' G?
Ayo I heard about this spot tonight if you are D-
O-W-N to go through I heard the do it B-
I-G I'll see you there at midnight, holla later, peace"")
I'm feeling crazy geeked this is the way to be
I'm dancin' in the public know all of the ladies see
We're moving through the scene flowing so fluidly
Long as I live I won't forget that night in New Orleans

Oh what a night
We make the most of every moment
What a night
So amazing

Full moon, French Quarter
I heard the tales of the city of Ls
Where the night's a mirage embracing the bizarre
Four divas on Ducatis rolled up kamikaze
The leader in leather stretching out a hand to grab
In a flash we burned ground ten miles out of town
She had a fleet of helicopters on a landing pad boom
Within minutes we all on Mount Driskill
Overlooking the summit there's more than 600 people
Waiting to burst
The party shaking the Earth men and women in white linen
All screaming when I walked in
And the host former Forbes cover billionaire
Was a Lifesavas fan found out we was there
Shook my hand and said you're the guest of honor old sport Sorry for the theatrics but I had to act quick
Tonight anything you want just ask
And if you play a couple songs I can pay you in cash
And as I reached to call Jumbo, I could hear him up close
Sayin' (""Vurs you here too? Let's give 'em a little dose"")
Like (Oh what a night)
While the crowd unifies and fireworks illuminate the sky
An amazing ride you couldn't beat the price, man
Miracles never cease in life

Oh what a night
We make the most of every moment
What a night
So amazing

(Now Gab told Vurs, and Vurs told me)
""Yea word is it's poppin' over on Bourbon Street
I'm about to dip, maybe find me a treat""
(A'ight, me too I'll be back around 3)
Big brother G-A-B was stylin' major
Vursatyl said Jumbo make 'em move it
So I thought about a style wit a Kool Aid smile
Word up my crew already knew it
Now you know you're gonna stress shorties wanna sex
Xcel was gettin' live on the 2 decks
You been beggin' and cryin' for somebody's
Rhymin' to set you free
For God so loved the world he gave ya three
MCs that do it so greasy
Tell ya 'bout the night we blew the Big Easy
Dip off stage for some good Creole eatin'
Compliments of Brook Billion over in V-I-P
Mardi gras beads, he bowtie and vested
""Meet up at Tipatina's at 3"", he suggested
The streets now balconies are crazy crowded
Flash to Vurs sayin'
""Next bucket list outin'""
""Who dat! Who dat!""
Whole House of Blues screaming
""Do dat! Do dat!""
Yeah that's my Quannum crew team and
A dime caught feelings now I'm schemin'
Look, you had to be there to get my meaning

Oh what a night
We make the most of every moment
What a night
So amazing
Oh what a night
We make the most of every moment
What a night
So amazing
Oh what a night
We make the most of every moment
What a night

World of Vibrations,The Craft,2005.0,"We'd like to welcome you all again to the world of vibrations
Introduction to the nation, a revolutionary thought
Hear the sound evolve, expand, and changin'
Most of the things that we're sayin' haven't broken through your chatter
So y'all niggas still ego trip based and
Have not begun to taste the
 
kundalini wisdom bliss
I'm droppin' as a lyric quotin' vessel for the sages
Play this on your playlist
I like dough
But musically I'm transcendin' the physical
And don't blame me for the slang and the word
God writes these rhymes through me
I just listen to him
I'm just livin', dude
Matrix driven rules haven't fooled me
Cuz I still think abstract
And stay metaphysical
And challenge what is really real
And keep creatin' with the force to bring rap back
Not that it's away
But everybody got somethin' to say
So let me speak the opposite of what's hot now
And make that hot
So it will get exploited
And the corporations only owe back dudes who bite my style
And they can try and try again
I've even been influenced by a lot of pioneers
South to the East and West
But when a hot MC
Gets on stage with a real MC
Most of the time the situation gets hostile

We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world and intro to
Fall into a space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Let us up inside of your head
Just step inside our world of vibrations
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed

Take time with the pad and the pen to dig within
In a world full of BS that we're livin' in
To my ears music sounds sweet as cinnamon
So I stay poundin' out tunes again and again
It's the 5th chapter, ladies and gentlemen
And I still got MCs on my dinner menu
Write late at night this isn't David Letterman though
On second thought, 
I'm like a letter man so
Let the craft evolve catch a little syndrome
Shootin' through your veins, vibratin' though your eardrums
Used to think 30 years old then the end comes
Now I feel like I'm just gainin' momentum
Seen the world two times all except India
About to vacay there when we finish this one
Work hard but still some sleep
We won't mention them
In fact, they act as fuel for our engine
Engine engine number 9, mic lynchin'
When we're done with this these songs are our pension
MCs are puppets, Me, I'm Jim Henson
Take a squat or get chopped by the henchmen
City, town, state arena or convention
Please believe these the G's that ease tension
Rakka and Ev said it's a marathon
So song after song, we keep on inventin'

We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world and intro to
Fall into a space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go
We vibrate at higher frequencies
Let us up inside of your head
Just step inside our world of vibrations
Bump this from your birth to your deathbed

We vibrate at higher frequencies
Welcome to our world
An intro to fall into space
Where there is no thoughts
Just moments captured
Here we go
We vibrate at higher frequencies uh
Let us up inside your head
Just uh
Step inside a world
Of vibrations
Bump this
From your birth
To your death bed

The Sun,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"The sun giver giving sun living one day at a time
Fatter rhyme ripper when it comes
He is that inclined satellite drifting to the unseen
Patterns of the magic eye listeners will succumb
Feel the sunshine beaming through the drum line
Newer life it will reanimate a dumb mind
They used to bowl for columbine they uptight
Behold the rhythm see out of the dark here come light
They used to say it was a dark world the art spoiled
And rotten we plotting to regenerate the crop soil
The sun giver giving sun come and get it til it's done
If what you're livin' isn't fun get rid of it and run to the sun giver

The sun, the sun giver
The sun, the sun giver
The sun, the sun giver

Here comes the light at the end of the tunnel
Here comes the light at the edge of tomorrow
Before the night break day
Every bit of heart ache goes away
Need a little light to thrive photosynthesize
I could be like a flower that grows in the dark
Radiate inspire illuminate my fire
Two sticks together gonna cause a spark

The sun giver giving light living life
Make it brighter when it's dark
Put these rhymes inside your life
Shine like a bright light shine in the night might
Mightier than high tides rising to new heights
Heights striking like a light lightning bolt
Life it might strike y'all it's pain and struggle
Hustle work it out and fight fight
Paint a picture on a canvas make it something nice
Write through any obstacle this evening is a fight night
Bright lights big city night hype type passage
Right masters smashing through put on your hazard lights
Like every thought you feelin' in this world is all inside
Every moment you gotta be reborn as you die die
Sun giver come hither listen to the drum
If you got a little rhythm you could step out of the slums with me
Come get this daylight if you're living under some clouds
Son if what you're living isn't fun please get rid of it

40oz. for Breakfast,Melodica,1994.0,"A forty ounce for breakfast gets a brother through the day
I guess I shoulda had a V8 instead; anyway
Let me contemplate my thought something back to a time
When my fridge was full of booze but in my pocket not one dime
I remember back on Willis Ave, with my ace-boom homey Mark Black
I would start the day off hearin the sound of the fo'-oh crack
I went to work blitzed, so eventually I got dissed
And caught a shocker when my supervisor said ""You're dismissed""
Now as I stare at my last check now my mind is stressed and depressed
I spell relief S-T-I-D-E-S yes with a little excess less the worry
Why go job hunting today?
When I can sit back and smoke this sack and drink
And feel my problems shrink away
And by now, the rent's due in two weeks
But inside my mind that's just another problem brew can delete
I got evicted, to the point where the court martial came to my door
And said, ""Get this kid: get your bags and split you don't live here no more""
And now I'm ass out; I'm so damn hungry I feel like I'm gonna pass out
I asked my brother for a handout and he hooked me
Though I knew he had doubts
And rightfully so, cause I had new shit to deal with
I'm so confused I have no control of my life I think I'll get lit
So as my problems compile, I steady smile, oh yes
Sippin on that forty ounce that's leadin me to a path of nowhere
So as I think about tomorrow, I hesitate and say:
A forty ounce for breakfast, will get me through the day..
A forty ounce for breakfast gets a brother through the day
I guess I shoulda rolled a joint up instead; anyway
Seems like everytime I start I don't know when it's time to say when
Now my mental gets all blurred and inside talk the ill-behavin
Coolin with my boys, no names need to be mentioned
At a party with some brothers I don't know I'm chillin in some E&J
With a forty O-Z to wash the shit down
And plus a lot of marijuana now I need to sit down
I can't remember the last time I was this blew out of my cranium
My ears and head begin to hum aloud as the room spun; anyway
Next thing I know I blacked out woke up with vomit all over my coat
Start talkin out my ass I can't see straight but yet I quote
And I don't know what came over me, I started dissin both my homies
That I used to freestyle with and now I'm askin them to show me
What they got not thinkin straight I don't know why I posed the challenge
Now my ego is erupting as if I was Mt. Saint Helens
Some shit was said I know I can't erase and now shit ain't the same
I wish I had just one more chance to live that day again
I strain; cause this bid was to find a true friend
And loose them to booze in my system just ain't how I'm livin
Nothin I could really say to mend up how someone else feels
And so I guess I gotta wait and see if maybe the wounds will heal
And I really didn't mean a word I said though I can't prove that
Now the only thing that I can really say is I went out
And out I went and now and then I get irate and say
A forty ounce for.. nah
A forty ounce for.. fuck!!
Just one more forty just one more I'll make this last day
A forty ounce for breakfast, can get me through the day",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-40oz-for-breakfast-lyrics
Searching,Nia,1999.0,"Nia... Nia

Searching
For everything already there
For every thought already known
For everything that ever was, is, and will be

Struggling
Oh how we struggle
And the more we avoid it
The greater the struggle becomes
Until we realize
The struggle is the blessing
Progressing
Changing
Evolving
Growing
From a seed to a tree
From a child to a (wo)man
From a (wo)man to a spirit
To a god fulfilling his plan
Purpose
No words can describe the unnameable
No beginning
No end
Just always now
Marveling at the miracle
And all of a sudden
It all seemed to make sense somehow

As the World Turns,Nia,1999,"""Now, I thought I would talk about today
For your consideration, as the world turns
As the world turns, you read in all these scriptures
About the world, find out that the world does turn!""
As the world keeps spinning, we live these days
Dollar bill done drove the whole world crazy
While sitting on the porch letting ganja blaze
Never hesitate a moment to enhance my phrase
Since I needed that escape I take my pull
Seen the thugs on the corner trying to act all cool
Pretty much out of character
I look right through, their transparent exterior
You in my book getting written and I'm the derriere
Thought you was peeping me but I was aware of ya
You peep my ill expressions, how I just glare about
Trying to trace my inner world and my whereabouts
Well try on, try on
I'm watching everything that's going down
And it ain't nothing that I ain't been around
The same ghetto but a different town
Weeell, I remember growing up in the P-a-c
It was a whole lot of love in my family
I had clothes on my back and shoes on my feet
Times we didn't have a lot but that was fine with me
In good times and even bad times
Whether rainy, grey sky or the sunshine
Life was so much simpler, I didn't realise it then
But time has definitely made me a wiser man

The world keeps turning round
And time just keeps on moving
Sunday morning in the church just singing a song
Mama gave much praise cause her soul was strong
When I was young I used to do lots of thangs was wrong
I never thought about till one day she was gone
Now my daddy passed on about a year before
Reminiscing as I glance at the fishing pole
But these things gotta happen so we all can grow
And now they spirits much freer than they was befo'
So fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on, fly on
Cause there's angels in the midst
And they're guiding and watching me every day
And even though at times I let it get to me
Just a little and I go astray
We keep marching on and on
Young militants will watch and now we're growing
With kids of their own, as it all unfolds
As the world keeps turning on, the world keeps turning on

This one goes out to family, y'all come first

Back to the Essence,A2G EP,1999.0,"When I'm on the mic I stand tall with gall
Style worth more than anything you gon' find in mall
The treasure of the mutiny is what keeps you all enthralled
I lively up the people with the yes, yes, y'all
Create, wait, watch and let the fake fall
Employ my strategy like checkmate
Call your bluff in that destruction of all previous discussion
When I hit like a concussion your heart rate stall
Recorder all ball, your jaw go slack
I deliver, makin' quivers and shivers all down your back
Like a river flow the beat
Bounces in Cadillacs that's bumpin' that vicious Blackalicious
Kick drum that keeps punchin' through that speaker
Countinously, meticoulously
Etchin' out the spaces in time
For miles affecting rhymes that changing minds permanently
Like mescaline giving your whole peception perspective
A new design to wreck that misconception
Now we seeing eye to eye yet?
Can the MC speak? The suckas stay quiet
The crowd can get rowdy like the party was a riot
Try it and the ladies'll hoo-ride your ass up out the spotlight
""You crazy, don't you know that fool Lateef'll set it on you?
He better than you"" she telling you the truth too
I give you the proof dude
Step, you end up getting cut up by the cornerstone's edge
Down back by the  I say don't get contrary
'Cause baby I'm very a-highly motivated
I'm tryna do that plan ownership thing like Isaiah did
Hope your vision ain't impaired
But my prayers you can hear what I'm saying to you
Now if you fakin' it may sound strange to you
Like some way under my breath maybe I'm playing you
But I only do that murder rap shit for those who the cap fit
As for the rest I'm tryna take you all back to the essence

Back to the essence
When we in the house feel the almighty presence
Making MCs act humble like peasants
Smoking the mic and leaving nothing but resin
Making the spots pop like pots full of wesson
Making it hot, cooking your goose and your pheasant
Taking your props, leaving your ass butt naked
Soul exposed, no material protection
Low and behold, we going back to the essence

I be that G-I to the F when I get def up on that mic
I swing that lefty, no discrepency
And effortlessly and in the right frame of mind
Electricity combined with my soul and the way I flex the agility
Focus ability makes some heads quite restless in this vicinty
Tryna fill me out but they just jesters in my vicinity stuck in my art
Tryna feather my energy, I bless plenty of enemies daily
With expressions that'll lyrically man would like to get rid of me
In my quest to be the epitome, it'll be cold in helll
For I feel stress from any of these illiterate
Insecure about they little insignicant contributions
Infinitely I'm mocking yes
And don't whenever the Gift put out a fly quote
Yes, I'm doing my thing and leaving a cloud of cess smoke
Wherever I go, whether I'm balling, whether I'm flat dead broke
I'm heeding my call and leaving a ball of rappers with heads roast
And bringing that universal dopeness to the east and west coast
And really no one the best though is god
Allowing you to harness the energy within whoever feels it the most at the moment, takes it the farthest
So thank him 'cause it's through you that he manifest artistry
Like a painting with an infinte beyond lifetime warranty
And Satan is a wack diseased that needs to be quarantined
And caged in, I'm riding a boat of dopeness come on aboard with me
And engage in a tale of musical invention
An MC lynchin' convention GA lyrical fifth dimension miracles
All up in your system

Back to the essence
When we in the house feel the almighty presence
Making MCs act humble like peasants
Smoking the mic and leaving nothing but resin
Making the spots pop like pots full of wesson

By the time I caught up to freedom I was out of breath
Grandma asked me what I'm running for
I guess I'm out for the same thing the sun is sunning for
What mothers birth their youngens for
And some say Jesus coming for
For all I know the earth is spinning slow
Suns at half mast 'cause masses ain't aglow
On bended knee, prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter versus spirit
A metal ladder
A wooden cross
A plastic bottle of water
A mandala encased in glass
A spirit encased in flesh
Sound from shaped hollows
The thickest of mucus released from heightened passion
A man that cries in his sleep
A truth that has gone out of fashion
A mode of expression
A paint splattered wall
A carton of cigarettes
A bouquet of corpses
A dying forest
A nurtured garden
A privatized prison
A candle with a broken wick
A puddle that reflects the sun
A piece of paper with my name on it
I'm surrounded
I surrender
All
All that I am I have been
All I have been has been a long time coming
I am becoming all that I am
The spittle that surrounds the mouth-piece of the flute
Unheard, yet felt
A gathered wetness
A quiet moisture
Sound trapped in a bubble
Released into wind
Wind fellows and land merchants
We are history's detergent
Water soluble, light particles, articles of cleansing breath
Articles amending death
These words are not tools of communication
They are shards of metal
Dropped from eight story windows
They are waterfalls and gas leaks
Aged thoughts rolled in tobacco leaf
The tools of a trade
Barbers barred, barred of barters
Catch phrases and misunderstandings
But they are not what I feel when I am alone
Surrounded by everything and nothing
And there isn't a word or phrase to be caught
A verse to be recited
A man to de-fill my being in those moments
I am blankness, the contained center of an ""O""
The pyramidic containment of an ""A""
I stand in the middle of all that I have learned
All that I have memorized
All that I've known by heart
Unable to reach any of it
There is no sadness
There is no bliss
It is a forgotten memory
A memorable escape route that only is found by not looking
There, in the spine of the dictionary the words are worthless
They are a mere weight pressing against my thoughtlessness
But then, who else can speak of thoughtlessness with such confidence
Who else has learned to sling these ancient ideas
Like dead rats held by their tails
So as not to infect this newly oiled skin
I can think of nothing heavier than an airplane
I can think of no greater conglomerate of steel and metal
I can think of nothing less likely to fly
There are no wings more weighted
I too have felt a heaviness
The stare of man guessing at my being
Yes I am homeless
A homeless man making offerings to the after-future
Sculpting rubber tree forests out of worn tires and shoe soles
A nation unified in exhale
A cloud of smoke
A native pipe ceremony
All the gathered cigarette butts piled in heaps
Snow covered mountains
Lipsticks smeared and shriveled
Offerings to an afterworld
Tattoo guns and plastic wrappers
Broken zippers and dead eyed dolls
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
It matters not what this paper be made of
Give me notebooks made of human flesh
Dried on steel hooks and nooses
Make uses of use, uses of us
It's all overwhelming me, oak and elming me
I have seeded a forest of myself
Little books from tall trees
On bended knee
Prostrate before an altered tree
I've made the forest suit me
Tables and chairs
Papers and prayers
Matter vs. spirit, through meditation
I program my heart to beat breakbeats and hum basslines on exhalation

Yes he is, oh, yes indeed

Boasting and fussing

Tearing up the drum and bringing heat, uh-huh

Blazing on your local ghetto street corner (the Chief, uh-huh)
Eyes in my mind, pulse signs in my rhymes
Lines are inclined shine, dine in my shrine
Warring time, mortifying, sauna flying lines
Borderline Einstein, horrifying times
Ordered like slaughter fights for the fight-type
Sure to strike, pouring like water might, I
Smoke like a sack of that northern lights hype
Swerving off a nitro ice-cold quarter pint
Saw the bright light, rappers caught a night-night
Bona fide nice ice, Dolemite type
Sorta like Border Heights, what a sight, yipes
Showing motherfuckers how to hold a mic right
Photo light images Yoda might bite
Soldier-like stripes, word to Spike, build a vice is
Photo volt bright light, hold the funk inside
Glowing like solar kites, sho ya right quite

Beats to the rhythm, rock raps in the day
Feast on adrenaline, master the way
I'm the verbal hunter going after my prey, they
Running for the highest mountain yelling out ""mayday!""
G-A-B, the great annihilator of the way they
Be all on sacred sceptre 
jocking, like a Pele
Soccer ball, kick em all, drop em in the Bay say
Fatter than your nigga Albert yelling ""Hey, hey, hey!""
Putting on apprentices like Brandy did Ray J
Shutting down your business like 15-80K day
If you ain't efficient you'll be all up in a melee
Gab'll bring the richness of the sun into your grey day
Take your AK, put it in a little tray
Lay it underneath the surface of the earth and let it stay way
Out of sight and mind so you can focus on your time in climbing
Rhyming, hey that beat like grime and shining be my pay day

Slick-slippery, quick ripping these, shift physically
Drift with a kick kicking me
Hickory dickory, emcees are sick of me
Zen trickery, get the gist, sent wizardry
Split-lickety, spit it could be lit
Like this, into me, it is a secret
Emcees pretend to be kin to the Gift
I'm mentally shitting the wisdom of centuries
Wit, go on like a centipede's length
Rappers want flames, man, I injure these shrimps
Skew em on the barb' with some hickory chips
I'm a level higher than the intermediate
Rappers, I don't care about your gender, descent
Background, police records, history, rent
Unpaid evictions, charge penalties sent
Merciless in battle leaving enemies bent, it's the Gift!",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-reanimation-lyrics
"Rhymes for the Deaf, Dumb and Blind",Melodica,1994.0,"Ah what are you talking about make some noise?
That was dope though
What? No, not me. No no no no no no no no no
Go 'head man

I got rhymes for the deaf dumb and blind
And a 20/20 eyesight; big mouth yappin
Crystal clear ear competition mere child's play
When I'm formin up, can't be guarded now, sendin y'all to the
Drawing board, I floored niggas with the skills
I'm sick and bored, of all the triggers and the steel
That you're cappin; why don't you give all that weak shit a rest
And start rappin - I'm puffin the buddha bless yes I'm packin
BOWLS, and spittin the rhymes on test the bra
Be like D'Wayne from *What's Happening* talking about ""Uh-uhh!""
Ya, can't defeat me, delete me, beat me, greet me
With a grin or, get your chin jaw and your neck broke
And then I'll rip off your arm and throw it in a stew—
Boy I'll make mincemeat of you, simps beat a few, wimps eat a few
Shrimps need a new, temp-orary mind-boggler, follow me, G
Niggerole, bigger flows, hover over small ones
Others flows will fall, come and get some
Runnin shit one rhyme AFTER the next
Master the flexology, follow me, take all of me
Fuck a beast, buck a beast, sucker please
Don't you know *Miuziweighs-a-freakin-ton* like Chuck D's?
Psych! Thought I would contradict myself, didn't ya?
I'm gettin ya
I'm hittin ya ass with bass all in your face so taste the bit
In ya, bowls of Soul, get on a Train but I'm not Don Cornelius
Really it's not no gimmicky shit like chicken popcorn
Now new and meatier, shootin like a meteor
Beats fat and beatier, feed me your brain child
The strange style contains foul language
So tell you kids to go to sleep so the beat can enhance you ock
If you a rapper grab your mic broke cancel the Glock yo'
Ass is grass and I'm the lawnmower hey bonhead nigga
Put your rhyme in the towaway zone
Red's all I see like if my name was El Toro
On the land, smokin a reefer, underwater smokin a coral reef
I squash beef like a meat grinder
I'm the kind of chief rocker to seek and destroy boys
Oy, I'm all of that and a plate of chitlins
So won't you sit and listen to the way I flip the script

Won't rule as a tyrant

Supreme people living with they backs aligned
Up against the wall cause these days are asinine
Livin' in a money matrix, how cats survive
Some will fade away and wither, others will blast a 9
Kings and queens workin' nine to fives
And making nothing searching for a deeper purpose in life
This can't be life, with all this work this can't be right
Without no money in my pocket I just can't see right
I used to try to preach to younguns like, ""Do right kids""
Now-a-days all that I can say is, ""Get it how you live""
Live how you get it, shit!
Don't nobody wanna get...
A promotion up to fry cook like little Calvin did
Some would rather take a gamble, hey they might do bids
The allure of fast money in this hell-bound system
Got you lookin' at two-hundred bucks a week
Versus, like a thousand in a day
Tell me what makes more sense to these

Supreme (Supreme, Supreme) 

Trapped like rats in mazes for the cheese
Every natural resource is here, we don't really need money
But certain people need power over people
They act like that cause they're trapped inside their ego-sphere
And now you can't feel free
Without material possessions, you can't just be
And without 'em you're left stressin', so anxiously
So you grab the Smith & Wesson, then aim, then squeeze
To get what's comin' to ya
The block's so hot, it blew the top off the thermometer
The rush for drama is more appealing than a plain life
Cause life is insane, so insanity is a sane life
It's so easy to see, simple as day and night
Supreme people born out of the way of the light
Into darkness, trying to fly straight
To some folks it's like being a fish swimming with sharks, shit!
Perhaps not since men turned their ears to the preachings of a mere prophet 2000 years ago have the words of humble men reached so many with such force. And, perhaps because it has been burning so long, now smoldering, now bursting into hot flames, now hastily covered over to smolder again until the next outbreak

Supreme (Supreme, Supreme) 

Supreme people only want the best and a
Supreme people won't settle for less than a
Straight from royalty put inside projects and a
Capitalist system that don't make sense to ya
Supreme people put against the fence, get a
Bit irate and hostile if you ain't fixing the
Problem you created that made these conditions up
A little reparation for your acts are sin to us
Supreme people ride or die to get the bucks
Some by any means so, hey, lock your benzes up
Tuck your chain and watch and keep your defenses up
All they wanna do is live it up like you cause they're

The hazy days go to nights returning on and on
The eye in the sky that don't lie be watching all y'all
The troublesome time filled anxieties just keep crawling on
And a dream world line up in your mind just keep on calling y'all
(Verse 1)
The shining lights of stages after the show are faded
The crowd is gone away, and now the dawning day
Gives way to creatures lurking, can hear the crickets chirping
Only the owls can see for this is when they stalk their prey
The homeless ask for quarters for shelter and some water
Say ""sorry not today"" and turn and walk away
The busy street is empty whistling winds are blowing gently
Listening intently to all of the things they have to say
A day of work completed a night of rest is needed
Almost done read a book but eyelids to heavy to read it
The fireplace is kindling, snug with your queen and building
About the victories tomorrow's gonna bring your way
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
Gazing outside the window the sunny skies dwindle
And now it's full of stars a hurling comet soars
While during the body slumber the soul begins to wander
To dream dimensions see the inner conscious doesn't pause
Keeps moving where it's bound to say now I lay me down to
After that stretch and yawn energy left and gone
The sandman's on your shoulder whispering in your ear he told you
Let all your problems go tonight I'm rapping hear my song

Almost done read a book but eyelids to heavy to read it

And for that, I vow to be a vessel

I didn't have to be, given the gift to rip
I'll never master me, I know that it's from Him
Or Her or It, dimensions that sit
Waitin' to sift through me, I fall short, still it hits me swift
I didn't have to see, I coulda hit the lick
I coulda drifted quick, I coulda quit so quick
It's really a trip, I guess I was picked
I don't know what I did to deserve a ride like this (Damn!)
I didn't have to eat, I coulda been so thin
I didn't have to be, quoting these sentences
I didn't have to reap, the work put in but then
Even the work in itself was such a blessin'

And as hard as the times are, God is livin' through beats
That come not from minds
But that travel through spiritual reasons
Some of the time, I feel like, it's not even me
No mon-ey can buy gateways to infinity
Still I'm hun-gry to shine, when I know I should let it be
And I want but I have, every single thing that we need

It is a duty, a way to live, another way to give
Another way to just, have communion
With the source of the sun and moon and
A way to pay the bills
Displayin' skills, I take it REAL serious
The vibe's so mysterious, not just one more day to kill
..and I could lose my connection
If I do not respect it enough, fade away it will
Day to day it gives energies

Get you on your tiptoes
I'm a drama dropper stomping all up in your zipcode
Schizophrenic your panicked running from my epilogue
Rap is like an insect, crushed, that I be steppin' on
Lethal weapon armed deafen all y'all heads
Up to the point of where your nervous smoking pall mall 'grettes
I'm coming at ya busting at ya like a sawed off bit
You feel the horror of the slaughter
Then your halued off wrecked
I'm breaking all yall necks in half flex
Know the mathmatic formulas of fury
Hey lets go the path of the terror dome zone dweller
Never goin gold
Nigga better phone home
Tell them mail a chrome tombstone
Head up on a pedastal
A medical attention couldn't ever make it better from the metaphor of lynching
Now get up out the kitchen before you burn from the diction
With your head up in the stitches until you learn with conviction
I'm addicted to inflicting you with your self-doubt
Sticking the key to the ignition and I blow, melt down
Facillities belittle mc's
We killin' 'em
Squeeze the mental trigger when I enter
Spittin venom with ease
Bring it

Trouble, what trouble

Trouble, what trouble
Trouble, what trouble
Emcees are in
Trouble, what trouble
Faster than a speeding bullet power of a BART train
Naturally the coolest when I'm rolling with my thought train
Fill me up with octane
Mentally are my brains coming down the chimney slipping gifts up in your stocking
I came to win not just to play because I got game
Niggas playing hard and can't identify with my pain
Clean the hemoglobin off your sweater after I stain
Fit condition lyricism like Jack LaLanne
My main point is just to show you I'm the jizoint
Rappers never captivate I'd rather hear a pig oink
Pin point precision impairin y'all's vision
A lyrical whizzical microphone magician
Pull a rabbit out a hat and send him back to his habitat
Your buried in the pages of my rhyme flow avalanche
Put your smack down on your candy ass critics
The extravagant battle cat totallin' your cadillac
Matter factly Blackalicious in your factory
Fatter raps be bustin' puss out your acne
Planned a wack scheme to attack me
Shattered that dream at a rapid ass speed, black
Bring it back trouble

When your mind feels stressed and the soul feels drained
And you get depressed cause the world’s insane
And you feel duress in the wilderness
You will kill to just find a different plane
When the jobs are few and the funds are low
When the justice lacks and you want some more
Cause the poor stay poor when the rich get more
And you starving inside and can't front no more
When the government lies and they rig them votes
And you wonder what happened to friendly folks
Because no one smiles when the youth goes wild
And the old lose hope when your life’s on trial
When you tried your best and you live one pay cheque
To next pay cheque and the darkness fills
Cause your needs aren't met
And you’re right at the breaking point on the edge


When the doors all closed and the bridge been burnt
And your mind feels gone cause of what you on
But you stay too long cause it feels so good
And it feels so right and the world so wrong
And it calls you back and you can't seem to capture
Your old self back and the fear’s overwhelming
It seems so massive try and you try
But you still go back
When you just exhausted and seems so done
And you feel like retreating but can not run
When there’s doubt all around you it's like no one
Has an ounce of belief and you overcome
And they all say no but you feel this force
That will not stop flowing a tight rope wire
With wind that’s blowing for all you can see
Its the final moment
He will never give you more than you can ever take
Take the dollar in your mind and put it into a faith
Know that there is something on the other side that waits
So identify it you will find another place
He will never give you more than you can ever take
Take the dollar in your mind and put it into a faith
Know that there is something on the other side that waits
So identify it you will find another place

She got everything you need
And got everything you dream about
Heaven's in her smile, she'll steal your heart like a crook
Now (she knows) exactly what you want and when
And (she goes) to any measures just to see you get it
And (she flows) like the Nile
I think that she was Nefertiti in a life before this present one was took
 X 2

P-O-W-E-R-S
Fizz and bubble when I see her yes
Want to see just how deep her abyss gets
Lost in the magic of her secret bliss
She is a bonafide keeper just
Want to travel inside and seek her depths
Mystique so fresh
From the west coast to the east coast
It's a death blow make a Negro get
Spun up in her web she don't need no net
People only behold
She knows just
What I need make an ego
Fly like an eagle
Feelin' regal, o b-o-y
O she's so fly
Lethal injection
Frozen in my step like deep in breath
Keepin'a brethren like me in a head spin
Doc take a rain check
She is the medicine

She got some tricks and she got some treats
She'll shake the ground underneath you
Knock you off your feet
You dig everything about her
From her head down to her follicles
Hear melodies and sounds of music when she speaks
Now (she stays) persistent with her energy
And (she plays) those games when it's time to play 'em
And (she ages) like the finest kind of wine
And just a whiff of her ferment will make your knees get weak",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-powers-lyrics
Dream Seasons,Nia,1999.0,"2000 the season of:
All the dreams that you're dreaming of
Trouble times that are easing off
Fill the world full of peace and love
All the souls that are reaching up
Just a song in time be’s enough
To balance out and to even up
All the thoughts that your thinking of

Inner world wisdom
Temporarily all the voice filled in
Light shining in the places that were real dim
Realin'? body mind 'n spirit building
Delivering a scalping to a pilgrim
And throw a pow-wow with indigenous men
Return to present through the womb of a big pen
Slipping back out as altered reality slip in
I'm on a journey to a whole other dimension
The deeper that I get I'm leaving comprehension
Envision a blur life is but a big spin
A musical aura is another way I'm glimpsing


Even in the hard times
Feeling precious suddenly I feel the god-mind
I design put me back in line, acting fine
If life is prison then the music is the yard time
It's all fine put my anger in a war rhymes
You won't forget 'em even if you stuck with Alzheimers
From outta nowhere to the Earth so call me fall guy
My big eye guides the vision of my small eyes
It’s from the heart so, good or bad, I won’t apologize
It ain't me anyway it's coming from the all-wise
Raw hide dig in deep into the archives
No matter what I gotta hit it where the ball lies
At all times


Go around come around
Come on now
Homeward bound, show 'em how
Growing now
Cop blow 'em down, hold it down
Throw it down
Much wholer now, slowing down
A lowenbrau
A world within a world I'm
Folder now
Woven vow, chosen style
Golden child
Soul in doubt, older now
No denial
In it for the love won't
Throw the towel
Goat around motormouth
No to doubts
All them non believers is
Moded now
Living through the music at
No amounts
Hold the ground on the town
Grow a pound

Love’s Gonna Save the Day,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"I started kicking in doors just for the money
Trap off the bando just for money
Stick em up stick em up just for money
Yo nigga didn't understand nothing but money
Give them hell migos migos
When i woke up this morning i told myself i had to get some money

I can't hang with you joe bonus
Cause you know that's not making me no money
Can't hang with that broke shit
I had to cut that bitch off god damn all she wanted was some money
(You know i hate that gold digging ass bitch)
I can't hang with all my homies cause they handouts for money
I started kicking in doors just for the money
Trap off the bando just for money
Stick em up stick em up just for money
Yo nigga didn't understand nothing but money
Now that i up, these hoes so easy to fuck
They after my bucks
I didn't buy anything but one pair of chucks
I'm in the jungle i'm for the knife
Hit em with the chopper knock a nigga off
They do it for the money cause they know i'm the boss
My niggas bad they bad pull up with missiles and sawdust
We got the green like Boston play with that kid like Angela Sauston?
Smoking on cookie and coughing you'll think that somebody got prisoned or coffined
Heroin blacken like coffee (black) hogging that shit then we off ‘em
Look at yo bitch look at lil mama stalking
She wit me now you can stop all the calling
Play with that water like i was a dolphin
We missing now don't get piece of that almond
You want this shit nigga stop stalling
Free me nigga all set so we can get the balling

It’s 2015 and my double come money You laughing right now but fast shit gon’ get ugly
Tell them it's a bread and payback is nothing
Get finger for life but they don't give him no budget
Smoking on Cookies, the cookie jar musty
Treat the blunt like teddy bears n i stuff it
You talk to a cop you get gwap and cuff it
Bitch ass police nowadays they gon’ buss it
Then i’m back and again, all about the benjamins
I'm a human being so forgive me if i sin
I done been broke before I ain’t gone back no mo’
I ain’t come this far to fall off the pedestal
I done took a walk n walk down to Texaco
Talk a chico finesse him for oregano
Do what n suppose u can't knock up a hoe when u betta no friend or foe
Dem monts  in ma pockets on sloppy joe
Christian Louboutin spikes on my tippy toe
Brake the wall out my name is Chris Jericho
Niggas my shootin’s affecting these pussy cone

Escape,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"Where he came up at it was like kill or die
People with guns packed livin' that iller life
Where poverty was rampant bloody murder in the night
And people striving some would, others wouldn't win the fight
Cause see this one dude lived on the other side of town
A big house, father and mother tried
To give him everything he wanted, things that others tried
To have and wanted to obtain they taught the brother right
From wrong around then, crack epidemic hit
The brothers sellin' drugs is who the ladies kicked it with
It seems they have the most respect as well as dividends
He got out of going to school so he could get it in

Escape from the block, get out, get away
Escape from the block, constant mental elevation
Escape from the block, create your situation
Escape from the block, and make a better day

Now as some time pass
He's in and out the pen
He's had a few kids, still isn't sinkin' in
He's doing lots of Oxycontin and some Vicodin
Upon returning to the block to live that life again
It's full of young guns he used to get respect
But now he's turning 30 and he's an official wreck
His baby mother hardly ever lets him see his kids
His whole crew he grew up with is dead or doing bids
Some moved away far, but still he bangs his block
His family members closest to him tell him change his spot
Of residency get on out and let your life unfurl
See you ain't ever really trapped 'cause we live in a world
But he's a street dude livin' by street rules
He'd rather die reppin' his block than ever be through
Being respected as an OG someone no one dares
To cross but what he doesn't realize is no one cares

Escape from the block, get out, get away
Escape from the block, constant mental elevation
Escape from the block, create your situation
Escape from the block, and make a better day

So many young cats that wanna rep the streets
Ain't even from that I wish this shit would cease
How many people that you know retiring from hustling?
How many grown men over 30 that are doing nothing?
See back in high school it was the thing to be and
Instead of livin' like a nerd but hey the things you see in
The past ain't nothing like the future now the nerd is ballin'
And the only thing you got is lint inside your wallet
Now as respect goes think of a different plan
Instead of gangsta I would rather be a grown man
Because a man handles his business building better days
And a gangsta only ends up in a jail or grave

Escape from the block, get out, get away
Escape from the block, constant mental elevation
Escape from the block, create your situation
Escape from the block, and make a better day

Make You Feel That Way (radio),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Chorus x15)
Make you feel that way
(Verse One)
Up an early for the hope of a brand new day
See a homie you ain't seen since back in the day
Fresh haircut fitted wit a fat ass fade
End of work, we chilling on a Saturday
How you felt when you first heard the data came
Rakim KRS hey I had that tape
Cooling out with ol girl on a fat ass date
Find a hundred dollar bill wow man that's great
Get promoted at your job up to management
Plot a long time finally a plan has made it
Time I feel I wanna shout, man its real that way
Wanna think of things that make you feel that way
(Chorus x15)
(Verse Two)
Christmas day when your mamma got your first bike
Type of feeling when you went and when your first fight
How your team felt winning championship games
Celebrate in a huddle dancing in this rain
Have a thought see a shooting star cross your screen
Put in hard work finally your living your dream
Deaf man get his hearing now in come vibes
Blind man get sight see his first sunrise
Dumb man speaking out, now he's load and clear
Earth through your chout smile so proud ya wear
Going in your third eye for the styles ya hear
Making music that'll bump for a thousand years
Eating right feeling conscience like health is first
Said a prayer that's sincere and you felt it work
Times I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I'm thinking things that make you feel that way
(Chorus x15)
(Verse Three)
All up in her vibe something coming over me
Summer days more likely that you notice breezes
Winter days more likely that you notice heat
When I'm warm more likely that you notice me
In the dark it's more likely that you notice light
In the light more likely that you notice night
Hungry more appreciation for that meal
Dead broke more appreciation for that grill
A bad day'll make you really notice ones that's good
And that'll make things a little better understood
Times I feel I wanna shout, man it's real that way
When I think of things that make you feel that way
Make you feel that way...
(Ya know its like ahh like the most greatest feeling you could ever feel
You like just total illation. Sunny day, just that day
You know its just like you know just the most joyous feeling
You could ever comprehend. You know, chilling with your family
You know just you know just really really feeling
Feeling the moment, with the folks. Ya know really really really just chilling

Melody felonies
Heavenly ebony make it feel like the 70's
Steadily ready for the path ahead of me
Ask ahead and believe that and let it be
Checking my recipe
Sprinkle with sesame
Smother with ketchup and green pepper rotisserie
Sizzling, this'll be served, mood is glistening
Me and my mistress sitting
Cooling in Sicily
This is the eve of sissy emcee fricassee
This is your piece my sweet, tasty isn't he?
Pastry with your drink?

Making you dizzy and things
Laugh and giggling
You're fickle and ticklish in your soul

Master rapper emcee mentally drifting beyond

First day
Last night
Beginning of the end
Of the twilight flight
Mentally drifting beyonder 

I'm like a meteorite
I could be to your left
Or even be to your right
And still beating your reps
And from a greedier plight
Say, don't flee to your restrooms
Be obedient, fight
Be sure, see that you get to your
Menial heights
We are leading to let you know
Be to your life
Not what TV will get to you
Speedier sights and sounds
Eating your vegetables
Reading all night
And books, leading your flesh can move
Being beyond sights


Special delivery like I'm Federal Express
Mesh on your memory, I come ready to flex fess
Special divinity like I'm yelling ""oh yes, yes!""
Retro your memory so compelling you're breathless
Let the flow spill in from me, just settle you're restless
Mental capacity, lay your head on a head rest
Into the passenger seat for multiple excess
Injury damaging and emcee with a death wish
I'm wearing your energy around my neck on a necklace
And tearing your entity down and beckoning hecklers
You're staring go figure G, lyrically I'm the best dressed
Preparing the enemy like a hell of a stress test
Let's just be way up in the cloud as I quest this freshness
And slay you with a wild and aggressive, festive
G A and a lyrical style, impressive
Blessed Gift, and now I take a bow as I exit",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-beyonder-lyrics
The Hourglass,Imani Vol. 1,2015,"12:00 on the dot
Woke up and stretched
Filled with provocative thoughts
They say every day you wake up's a good thing
Caught my breath exhaled, inhaled, that's a positive start
1:00 reminiscin' on how time flies
Still a bachelor that's looking for that prime time wife
Need a cheering section that'll make them pom-pom's fly
Cause this kitchen's looking lonely as a wonton's fry
2:00 realized the mistakes were mine
Ask God for a plane then I look to the sky
Then he sent me a boat while I’m askin' him why
The plane hasn’t come yet the boat's passin' me by
3:00 took it all in and looked at my life
My homie said he'd trade his for a second wit' mine
All the travelin' and accolades, stages in life
But the grass is always greener when you on the other side of the hourglass

Now it's 4:00pm call my other homie up to see what's good wit' him
Still doing the same shit he did from way back when
Never do we speak of change, I don't want to offend
5:00 suddenly I saw myself in him
Guess I’m talking to myself when I judge and condemn
When I see my people do good I’m nudging them in
The right direction
Although on the low I’m guzzlin' gin
Got a call from my doctor at about 6:10
Told me health is not an option anymore
Just then
Realized I’m getting older
Life is not forever soldier
At some point you gotta grow up 'fore it all just end
7 is my lucky number I was born on ten
77 d I'm healthier and makin' amends
Every lesson ever taught to me I’m takin' it in
Every moment is a miracle created within
The hourglass

Now it's half past 8
People don't got a lot of hope these last past days
Can there be a revolution when no carnage awaits
Can we lock into the spirit can we harness the grace
9:00 sun is gone only stars and space
Don't know where the time went but with a pen and pad
And beat I'll follow time and space
Cause nothing is forever
Only thing that's constant: change
You'll never relive yesterday you can't rewind this tape
It's 10 on the dot
Did you utilize the day today and give all you got?
Did you live a little bit or are you living a lot?
It's 11:00

Alternate, end-ings, opposite trend Zen
Copperfield, pen bend, topple and kill end men
Send them, in wind, tremblin', off of them skills (skills, skills, skills...)

My copper top is poppin' tops (tops), the heat keeps flowin'
Energizer bunny, ain't it funny, how I stay so ever ready
But I never see the money (money, money, money...)

Money never makin' me
I make it, come inside and take a seat
It's vacant, Ego Sonic, inner space
The sacred sequel on again
Erase and cease the hatred season
Of the drums of war of sages past
Are speakin' through the ancients
Speakin' through the, speakin' through the ancients, speakin'

As a kid, I was Harry Potter-like
Not locked in a room but on the streets, they poked fun and took my bike
Until I chose to write, spec-tacular, vernacular, spells, for the fight
(fight, fight, fight...)

In the
Middle of the class
I was writin' my secret agenda
Getting' a bl-ast
From ignitin' my deepest surrender
A bit of chastisement
I may have gotten from teachers

Masses were stunned, I pass it on

Twist of Time,Imani Vol. 1,2015.0,"I remember when we all was geeked
Hit the button press play and hear all the beats
Every passer-by stopped so they all could see
The fulfillment and the fruition of all they dreams
Back then it was so much fun
So many laughs, so much ganja, so much rum
Fresh out the b with plans to get so much done
Livin' in the college Town with so much young
Enthusiasm, everybody focused to win
Where I was from everyone was smokin' to grin
This new heavy struggle never ended it seemed
Till I woke up to the fact that I was livin' my dream
Now I'm going everywhere: London, Rome, and Japan
I quit my day job, bummin' and broke to havin'
A glimpse a small slice of the American dream
Now life is feelin' better than I thought it ever could be
I think I'll go with this...

Looking back, some will climb
The futures unknown with the twist of time
Who come bearin' lessons and gifts combined
In the mental hidin', begin to find 'em
Looking back, some will climb
No one's a mistake they're just not aligned
And life can be great when you hit your stride
It's the blissful ride of the twist of time

All of us they threw our song on, MTV gettin'
Interview from Who(?) and Lala
The crowds aren't static when we on the stage
Doin' our job, we winnin' now we doin' it
It's time that we go all out - rock rock rock
Rockin' the stage showin' utter command
And the first time in my life, loanin' money to fam
Crew expansion out the wood-works people comin' to jam
Accolades from my heroes, damn how cunning is
Advocations out relaxin' places livin' in life and study
Spendin' the cash and maybe livin' the nexus
Really I'm feelin' blessed and very limited stress with the
In-consider hearing from the I-R-S.... Damn...

Looking back, some will climb
The futures unknown with the twist of time
Who come bearin' lessons and gifts combined
In the mental hidin', begin to find 'em
Looking back, some will climb
No one's a mistake, they just not aligned
And life can be great when you hit your stride, it's the
Blissful ride of the twist of time

And now the world is very different
It's bug when you start to see your young relatives get big
I blew a lotta dough but now I'm grown so hey let's get it
I've tampered with my health
But now I'm workin' on redemption
Songs in the key of time as it keeps twistin'
It's a roller-coaster ride so hop on before you miss it
And it feels good to be healthy, grown and so gifted
Time will move we goin' with it
Music flowin' so infinite - lookin' back!

Looking back, some will climb
The futures unknown with the twist of time
Who come bearin' lessons and gifts combined
In the mental hidin', begin to find 'em

Don't get used like a pawn
This is the dawn of a new era
Come, we can chant down Babylon one more time
But it's gonna take some time

The Rise and Fall of Elliot Brown (Part I and II),The Craft,2005.0,"""I mean um, I got years man, I go back, actually
I-I-I just got back to these streets man, this is home to me though
Y'mean, I was gone for a while, ten years to be exact
I lost my lights in the streets, y'know but for these streets, me and my dude
We got down and dirty for it, man, we did e'rythang, we took, nah'mean, to eat..
That's what it's about when I was comin' up in the 80s', everybody tried to eat man
And my way livin' to eat, man I gurped in theses streets
I grind, walked to these streets here, nah'mean?""

Got to get this bread
Got to get this dough, got to get these chips
Got to get these whips, and fits and -
Got to get real mean, got to get real clean
Got to get these fiends a fixin'
On a mission to get rich real quick use wit' no intermission
Got to live big, get big sittin' on them big {​​​?}​​​, so spendin' spendin'
Any witness get hit quick, this lick isn't never no kid shit
Not a picnic, flip bricks get rich, that's it
Big bills, just Ben's, no frills, just Benzes
Endless spendin' sprees
Limitless, BUILD IT UP TO THE MILLIONS
Then I can have things, like a new fly ring
And a new fly fling, I can do Irene, Darlene, Charlene
And Francine, even get inside Pam's jeans as clean as you ever did see
On the scene doin' real big things, as I PIMP this simple SYSTEM
Then I hear si-rens, and I see high beams
Now I am fly-in', but they're behind me
NOW I'm ON ONE KNEE, AND THE DOPE'S ON ME
NOW MY HOPE'S GONE SEE AND I LOST MY FREEDOM
LOCKED UP, SEE YA!!


He was a young lad
Off of happiness and smiles, he was sprung bad
Wanted all the trendy classy number one fads
In a very short time, learned the rules of combat
Learned who was a punk, and who would have swung back
How to take from the weak, especially when hung-ray
While mama's workin' two jobs, and daddy's gone away
And police be throwin' you vibes, even at a young age
And it was like he was livin' in a cage
From the outside world, cause he just couldn't relate
..and then life really began
And trifeness was a giv-en when he graduated
The Fall 
..So he hustled
Doin' whatever just to get the bread and mustard
Stacked high, grew wit' some niggas he trusted
He shouldn't have though, cause them same niggas got him busted
And 'bout the same time he 'bout to get sent up, his -
Ex-girl is like, ""I'm pregnant baby daddy - plus it's twins""
And when he goes to jail, he has company
In the form of fifty percent of the cats he grew up wit'
Gets out, goes back, just like a puppet
Caught in a genocidal death trap of the government
They don't rehabilitate, they just be lovin' it
When niggas is in the pen, cause that's big money makin' to them
The Rise 

For some time he sat and pondered
Trapped in a cell filled with criminals and convicts
Time had arrived to confront the real conflict
Lookin' within, not without, he got honest
Started to read and acquire that self-knowledge
Learned he was royalty and didn't come from garbage
How to embrace struggle and learn from his problems
True wealth is health, family, and a higher conscious-ness
Learned most of what he was taught was nonsense
Read up on economics and how to start a business
Self-determination and dedication empowered him
Somethin' inside him told him only God could STOP him
Now he's out livin' what others said was impossible
Thought he would be another victim of ghetto obstacles
Through a concrete, a rosebud started to blossom
Remember change is really all that remains constant, yeah (*echoes*)

""Saved message...Friday...3:56...P.M.""
""Hey, Big Tim, this is your sister Dee-Dee
I was just callin' to tell you that I, gone to see Frankie
And I told him that you wanted him to, um
GIVE a, like, what it was like to be in prison
And what, advice he would give and
Oh my God, I got this letter from him

Mellow minced, defeatin the mental
And become Gentle as Ben, but then they stibble and dribble
And bend like a pencil
The only utensil I got, is brain power
And you know it's essential I rock, I rain showers
Sleet snow and raise hella eyebrows with my styles
You're wondering how wild
When what where, made ladies so horny
They can't even be showin they butt bare
Look up there, beside the birds the planets the hawk
The rappers who talk the mo' shit
I'm makin em walk the plank they stank I'm takin they rank
They tossed tiddlewinks I'm playin em like that game
I'm gunnin and rackin and packin em up
And I'm runnin this here rap thang
Main, you wanna go to war, I'll take you
I physically break you, when I break through
I'm makin you fake crew, you made a mistake fool
I hate you MC's, I'll grate you like cheese
I may choose to squeeze, my pencil
And write out a couple of rhymes
Whooooaaaa, whooa my goodness!!!
Are we slaughterin, is this just slaughter MC night?
Or somethin man, what is this?
Is this all the aggression you ever had?
How many MC's must get ripped, before By says don't flip with the Gift

This is a song called Attica Black
It's a song about the mediocracy in mediocracy
And just, in general, the mediocracy in life
We hope you enjoy our presentation

Children gather round and let the rhythm buried in ya come alive with every word I speak
It's something that you really gotta feel to understand so bring a little bit ganja with ya
I scurry through my tapes straight looking for escapes from the mediocracy
There's gotta be stops gotta see how it ought to be not to be preaching but the wack just ain't dead yet
When you feel the funk inside ya
The inner soul is on its way
By the fire was I annihilatin' and breakin' em down
Was countin' and pointin' the mountain and I'm slayin' all the
To rule the industry instead of rhyming to be free you're rhymin' to get over losin' all the
So like the brothers in the prisons when conditions weren't improvin' started lootin' and the aunt said
And the aunt said
And the aunt said

Does anybody know what the situation is?
Do you know what we can do and what we can't do?
We can't say and what we can say? I don't know that anymore
I don't have enough time to go and research all the laws
So I'm in the position that the only thing I can say about that is, ""Fuck it""

Why'd you go and fall off and leave a motherfucker hanging on for some pawn shit, but you're butt as soft as some 
You want ya props
As far as I'm concerned ya finished and we never want you back no mo'
Here to take the poor conditions listeners are listenin' within to a higher plateau
Necessary dues to show our skills cuz there's just something too important and a fat bankroll
Wrecks well, neck swell from the thunder of the grooves in the headphone
Let's bail to a place called Melodica where rhythm is a way of life and when I'm at home Imma sing with the voice of a harp let our poems scurry free from the death of a melody
Rhymes be compellin' me to take our crews to break out fools make out do's and don'ts and rules you won't be able to front
I gotta be able to do what a rapper is able to do to give the people what they want

I'm takin' my time and
I'm makin' it rhyme and I'm makin' it shine and I'm blowin' they mind and I'm showin' hip hop and I'm doin' it every day
Takin' it, fakin' it, breakin' away all the blues
Ya know... Just tellin' it
Now I'm harder than a mother just singing this song
And keeping hella those smoke from the bong
Every little thing I do
And every little rap I do's an opportunity to dine on your carcass
Dine on your carcass
Dine on your carcass I thought you knew that talk is cheap
So peep the unique chic—the beat raucous (style)
You never heard before: words galore
I donor more for your pleasure madame
Miles to go, bro, so check out the flow so low no emcee can withstand the momentum, bent 'em, pent 'em, sent 'em
Flip the song back and let's start it all over again
Let's start it all over again

I  the blood
Who got whitey
I got the soul
Who got whitey
Black ain't only beautiful—It's bad too

Molecules, spontaneous combustion, pow
Law of de-fi-nite pro-por-tion, gain-ing weight

Lead, gold, tin, iron, platinum, zinc, when I rap you think
Iodine nitrate activate
Red geranium, the only difference is I transmit sound

Careful, careful with those ingredients
They could explode and blow up if you drop then
And may hit the ground
Let it flow, yo, just let it go, get back
C-A-O-H-2 wine water solution of calcium hydroxide
Slobbin it, C-A-O lime will make bleach powder
Galvanic metal beats stomp out louder
Dried ice, C-0 squared refrigerant
N-O-2 makes you laugh, it's laughing gas used by the dentists
I nearly added acid glue, I'm like oil of a toil, the king of chemicals
And the G heat gas waved all your mats
Chemical change, ice point, melt all your raps

Refillable gas keep going way beyond

By now you've guessed electrons are probably negatively charged
Neutrons don't follow either, neutral, in the middle, only no apologies
Centered, unmoved by yin and yang ideology
Neutron, bomb songs, electron fury
Cosmic musical radio-activity
Different points in joints within infinity
Oxygen and hydrogen alive within all types of energy
Within all types of energy

Cuz the wrath of the gift will be hittin' ya spliff
And a lot of the crews got sprayed and yelled RAID
Like a couple of roaches, as struggle approaches
A brother'll blow this
Another ferocious jam, I smother the ?grossagran?
I hover above the land of lame emcees that dont blow
I'm poppin' the clip and then bo bo with the gun
And a once in a munch chest, rest in peace
And I ?bellow you to beast? I abolish emcees with sounds like these
Run over enemies and I rest in the west-
Ern hemisphere, burn wit a fear is nothin but a mere setback
Hear when I'm here
Earn wit a clear conscience in the middle of the jet black
I'm a dog, running through the jungle
Wit a hoodie and black hat choppin down emcees
Not a frog, cunning yet I'm humble
Gotta do the jewels tack wack talkin clowns
Tip me, I'ma knock 'em all around, bust a front
With a fat blunt swinging on a vine in the homeland
I'ma tack 'em in the sound little punks when the rap bump
Springin on the rhyme I bowl man
Gifted when I'm lifted off a spliff hit
Reminisce shit, riff with dipshits
This shit is the mischievous style of the gifted
I'm a whiz kid, get a whiff kid
Swingin' down low, breakin' down flows
With a new flow medley outgrow when you step back
To the black with a fat rap with a fat sack
With a little bit a funk in my napsack
Take it back to the brother land
And I was smotherin' stupid idiots like Tarzan
Givin' back to the brother man and get another land
Man gimme it, its Or-land-o
How easy and tight wishin' into the depths
Up in the sound in the heart of the jungle
Gettin' wild with the art of the rumble
Never amount to be smarter than Dumbo
Make 'em mumble, make 'em humble
Get me round from the start, you will crumble
And you tumble, and you stumble
And I do it like that
From the end to the other end never gonna end
Set a trend with the maniac mic clutch
Hey Bob I'd advise that you keep your day job
My competitors never know the right touch
Have to bail through the backstreets, raisin' hell to a black beat
Rappers fail to attack me, like a sail with the slack g
I attack 'em like acne, exactly UGH
(spoken)
Mindless cretins grow through idiosynchrosy
Peels up, rising up, down
(Lateef)
Steppin' up through the deep, dank murkiness
No telling what is lurking
I hero it, but will I sense a jerkin
I proceed to bust a buster
Cuz I trust the finer design in the mind of the rhyme
Just about impossible to find
What a disgrace to the race of wack emcees
I am because I choose to stand my ground
FIRM and blowin' the rhythm the vermin and learnin'
All I know is we've earned every inch we've attained
And strained to gain, and what I'm tryin' to explain is that
The deeper we're creepin' the more we find sleepin'
And slippin' just shootin' dead lips on a mission
Its missin' the reason the gift we've been given the rhythm
Cuz that just the way we've been livin
And thrive in the essence, survive and its easy
To recognize when analyzing the flow
Surprises the lame in this line and tryin'
To get you to buy into their fantasy world
Can it be damaged the ?emina? bones
Of the fellas and men thats exploting my culture
Can't understand every breast that you touch
Was as up ?paper scun? be one hung motherfucker
Suckas nowadays, is fallin' and splinterin', just like timber, instead of
Gettin out of my way, and what I'm -- meaning to say is that
The canopy that covers me now is the blackest, attack this
I thought we already established the wackness
Presented in the cemented jungle
By the bumblin' brothers stumblin' tumblin' down
Surroundin me in a cannibalistic style, but I just smile and
Silence 'em like the lambs, they are the whole flock
We just one magic stockpile
I'm gettin' 'em off like crack viles, and wicked the whole fuckin while
Not trippin over no vines, or over no swine, or over no mines
Or over no line at the plot
Thinkin' of whippin' 'em like a Glock in the jungle
(spoken)
Now in the beginning of the journey
Not in time, but in the mind
Imagine the camels being loaded up
The men, loading themselves up
It's a long journey -- the oasis is all in the clamor
As we start from the top we go to the very bottom
Of a mysterious place -- a very mysterious place
What's that I see? Ahhhh
I can't even describe you, so I ain't even gon' try...mmmmhm
Making hell of MC Asias is now this I dont dispute but you knew
You knew Lyrics Born was a ripped off note sheet of a hundred
And you scrape the paint off your bumpers making sure you beat the buzzer
Making sure Lyrics Born came out his mother's stomach
Covered with the lyrics that kill
No bumper, right? Cuz mo'fucka
I know you can make colors rhyme
And have the whole goddamn planet yellin uncle at you and even
Still take the time big up little ?egg?, can you imagine?
Big up Asia Born, this little bottle
Or that you would even be lightly concerned with little, little worms
That you would tug at the line, pullin' the kind
Of lyrics out my mouth that make me big bad don, takin' kids' legs home
You can't even back a sliver roach, you know
That type shit, and then watch me wreck this stage
Boy like I got your daddy's style hangin' around my waist
And then watch me forget -- the way
Good lyrics taste, thinkin' I just ate little rabbit eyes in your heart
Man, cuz if I thought it was just
Lyrics Born that made lyrics born, lyrics born
And then suddenly I can't do no more, I'd be like
""Do you remember me?"" No, Asia
And you used to play my record on the way to the vapor",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-deep-in-the-jungle-vocal-lyrics
Swan Lake (vocal),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Verse One: Gift of Gab
Sittin on top of the bay, watchin the tide
It's time to break the tension away, come take a ride
As you enter the dimension of the crew SoleSides
It ain't nuttin goin on but a party
Now brothers wanna flex but I'm over they heads
I got the funky type of style to rip your vocals to shreds
I'm never runnin from the Feds wearin red Pro Keds
Cause -- I ain't did nuttin to no-BODY!
I dedicate that line to Shack from South Central
Not sayin I'm the baddest but I know I got potential
For every black man hung lyrically I lynch you
Your style is kinda dry hope my melody can quench you
My soul is one with all although my ego is against you
See rap is a raw meat, so now I got to mince you
I'm playin rappers out like an old pair of gym shoes
I can do anything, I can do anything
Crusin down the street in my six-four Impala
Is what I'd like to be doin if only I had the dollars
A baller ain't a baller if he ain't got balls
A scholar ain't a scholar if he ain't got scho-lastic
Education, and if not that, then learn from life
Beyond all of the material crap
A human ain't a human if he doesn't make mistakes
And the name of this song is Swan Lake
Verse Two:
A planet ain't a planet if it don't have wars
A battle ain't a battle if you don't catch scars
A mind that ain't inquisitive really doesn't got
Shit to live for if you can't explore the
Realms of thought you ought not test lest
You be chomped up, like a pop rock, stopped for a
Bead from the weed lady, thought it was the bomb
Really wasn't nuttin but a bag of strong palms
Lost twenty dollars, didn't get high
Maybe next time I use my finances right
Live another day, learn another lesson
Ain't no need to get my mental status cold stressin
That it's so ill that it's fo'-real that it's
No skill displayed, de shades gone now
So it's time to build my own umbrella
Tell it tell her hella mellow fellows loungin
Better bread I never fled a header of the sounds and
All I wanna do is run my own universe
Grab the mic and let my spirit just FLOCK when I croon a verse
Mind over matter, spirit over mind
A doobie and a skin funky breakbeats and rhymes
A true blue homey to the end reminiscin with your
Sister in the living room den
A life with a plan nine acres on a land
Building self by yourself helpin out a fellow man
Prepare for the essence when your inner soul's free
Before the departure plantin of the right seed
I think what everybody's strivin for is peace of mind
I'm thinkin the world is full of inner places that are out there to find
Manipulated minds need to make an escape
And the name of this song is Swan Lake
Manipulated minds need to make an escape
And the name of this song is Swan Lake",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-swan-lake-vocal-lyrics

Falling hurricanes
Earth shattering mid-rains
Scattering insane
Happening
Souls keeps burning
And the sky keeps plummeting
Now--
The sky is falling, life is appalling
And death is lurking, niggas killing each other
Leaving bodies nobodies searching for
And youth announced ..., catching a bit of murder one
And mothers is drinking and drugging, hoe-in; searching for their son
And liquor stores upon every corner
And younger people done accepted defeating
The melting pot of lavas seeping
And the hood is all the mic can conceive when your foes bleeding to their death
And you picking their pocket
Wanna just get even
Niggers is banging and coppers is banging punk snuggin
Highly intelligent Africans lowered to punk smuggin
And capitals of the planet, planets run by the government
And genocide 's overwhelming, devil is loving it
And children in highschool go 'n smokin their classes up
And people thats rich don't be checking for what is happening
Degrading all women, knock em up, leave em, now smack em up
And ain't no way to reach us we're sleeping like hells castle

Doctors and lawyers and scientists all are locked in the prison of the mind
And all the youth are unreachable but they teachable
But emcees don't be teaching them too
Down deep down in their soul
Amongst the prostitution and pimping, robbing and stealing
We give a name
Sab-a truth
This is nigga-land
Glad to knew ya
But give a damn
For the future
Religions is institutionalized
Hittin truths, even youths...alized
You got two pistols at the head of your own people
Its lethal but its living proof
Instead of leaving smiles leaven death inside of our living room
And instead of college they got us slangin after highschool
For the love of the money and everything that it will buy you
Everybody out for that
And they kill you if you a rival

Passion (A Cappella),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Rakaa Iriscience (Dilated Peoples))

An open microphone can be dangerous
Let's tune in on two of the greatest mcs out there


Passion
The will to win, the spark within
Passion
The strength within the hearts of men
Passion
The drive to press, to strive for best, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion
To play through pain and love the game
Passion
To break the chain and blaze the flame
Passion
The fight for rights to love your life, to rise
You've just arrived the quest is driven through
Passion

Propaganda, positive propositions
Politician, musician and a triple optician
Still part of my missions to slaughter the opposition
Critics that don't get it, I tell 'em to stop bitchin'
I do without blacks, I've done it without cash
Strictly for the love of the art - that's passion
Flashin', rappin' or jammin' or soundblastin'
When Quannum meets Expansion, this is what happens

Runnin' through the jungle with a flare gun
Arrow-arms, zoning out my mind
Like I was hooked on hero-ine
Take the fire, turn it up and blaze whole forest down
Pullin from within' the inner insane warrior
California to the District of Columbia
Hella high octane, lookin' through a lazy eye
All ablaze, fire, flames, lightin' up the sky
Runnin' through the burnin' sun, yellin'
Ride, nigga ride, nigga ride..

Lyric Fathom (original version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Gift Of Gab):
Rappers step to me like I'm a doormat
Check the format, I pour raps
Not your average everyday hardcore act actin'
I'm like a mac 10, a uzi and a AK-47
Rollin' with crazy kids like Bebe
Mayday mayday, I used to listen to KDAY in my heydays
I ride the bus with a dream of one day lampin' inside of a Mercedes
Benz with sheepskin interior
And two fifteens, and to rip means to get creamed
I'm large as a hippopotamus, trip, I gotta dis
Sip a bottomless cup of brew and I'm getting raw to this
If a rapper tries to step, I rip and slaughter his ass
Some shit, he oughta just swallow his pride and get to following this
I'm marvelous like Marvin Haggler in his prime
I carve kids like a dagger with my mind
I start shit with rappers who can't rhyme
I spark spliffs cuz I don't stagger when I'm high
But when I'm drunk I do, punk I do not acknowledge wackness
I gotcha grandma doin' backflips and tumbles
I rumble through the jungle with Ollie and Frasier
Call me the savior of hip hop
I rip shop and get my proppers
Come get with this ak, my style is akwards
I never mock words, I talk towards the inner city youth
Revealing it, the truth
I'm feeling that the proof is in the pudding
I put men that would end hip hop in my shop and I torture
Chorus:
Check out my lyric fathom
Check it brothers, really, check it out
(Gift Of Gab):
As I walk through the jungle with a knife on my ankle
Taking lives, skip will shank you lyrically
Apparently niggas wanna sleep still
Keep still, I'm packin' the a heap of skills
I'm rhyming to keep an ill mind, Saddam type shit
Your arm might get snapped like a twig
Rap like a nig-gero possessed thorough
The astonishing mission, dishing pain
Fishing in brains, plain lynching niggas bitchin'
So take a ride, I'd abide by my rules
Cuz fools I had duels with, I left them in the pool pit, I rule kids
I'm a kamikaze bomb, drop a nigga with an arsenal of drama in my rhymes
With the tracks and backs and heads is broken to pieces
Rapture's phat, ya dead, ya croaked
I wrote this piece as just a little dedication
To the rappers on the other level
Budded out and looking into space, a new frontier
And I can probably bet cha that we got anything you want here
Cuz punk, we're the crew that make you cheer
The two that make you fear and send you back to the rear
We're here
CHORUS
(Gift Of Gab):
I flip and I rip shit
I whip and I dip shit
With the lyrical form, I did kick it slick
I'm gifted, I'm ripping a nitwit to shreds
Get the Feds to arrest me for slaughtering emcees
That's right, on my testicles
Come get a little array of the skill supreme
Wanna defeat me? My nigga, you should kill the dream
The noise, the boys, the count, everybody
When I drop fat styles that ain't your simple blahzay blah
Lodi Dodi average Joe Simpleton with a average flow
Have to go after you jugular
Then shit gets uglier
Man I hope you take heed
I'm making brain cells bleed in excess amount of hemoglobin
I rap, yes I'm out to see you bobbin' ya noggin'
I've been gobblin' niggas talkin' shit like Hagen-Daas
Stompin' ‘em, mobbin' with the ill ass skill as seen
On individuals who fiend for the real shit",https://genius.com/Blackalicious-lyric-fathom-original-version-lyrics
