Hive,Doris,2013.0,"Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns
Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously
Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out
Crack-a-lackin' like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga
[Chorus: Casey Veggies & 
Earl Sweatshirt

'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, 
double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – 
rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – 
rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused 
like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch

From a city that's recession-hit
Stress niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, 
tryin' to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, 
and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breakin' News: Death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, 
heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you prayin' to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
*blow* – disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a Lear, steerin' it into the kid's ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl
Rawer than a skinned knee cap on a blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Strikin' – wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt – pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrollin'
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

Quit with all that tough talk
Bro, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down
Bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill – so test it, all my weapons is real
Sellin' thizz, couldn't tell 'em what the recipe is
Got 'em wishin' that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwin' out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words, I'm gettin' money
Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scarin' me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walkin' down death row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, ""Wet 'em if they test you""
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seein'
Kitten soft but in they songs be trappin' hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it, but to each his own
I ain't trippin' long 'cause I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas,
 police pass
Tell 'em ""Free Smalls,"" off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief of police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas sprayin' K's
Ruger with the pork face
, 
Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, 
Coldchain

Chum,Doris,2012.0,"Something sinister to it, 
pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving 
through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
""Golf"" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly I miss this nigga, like when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, 
the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

Something sinister to it,

Uh… time lapse, bars rotten, heart's bottomless pit
Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these 
Complex
 fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much,"" you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

Something sinister to it, 
pendulum swinging slow

Sunday,Doris,2013.0,"I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
See, it seems that

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck

I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they're coming in droves
You'll only miss when it goes
Yeah, I think that's it
When it goes",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-sunday-lyrics
Earl,EARL,2010.0,"Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the ""ass"" in ""assassin""
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
""What you doing?"" – nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

Fuck 2DopeBoyz
Eat my dick, I'll eat ya ass!
Fuck 2DopeBoyz, fuck them niggas man

Get up off the pavement, wipe the dirt and vomit off
DopeBoyz hating, but them faggots is a lot of talk
Cotton soft pussy, them Odd niggas is Molotov
Cocktails; fucking toss one in your apartment, dog
Wolf Gang, we ain't barking, nah
Try talking on a blog with your fucking arms cut off
Put in a carpet and watch it get auctioned off
The Ace tell Shake's daughter
""We're sorry, but papa's gone, bitch!""

Odd Future Wolf Gang, nigga
Fuck them 2DopeBoyz niggas
Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill 'Em All, don't give a fuck nigga
Litter Life nigga, stay pop nigga, what's good?
Earl, what up nigga?
Fuck Steve Harvey!",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-earl-lyrics
Whoa,Doris,2013.0,"Nah, no, nah, nah, fuck that. Niggas think 'cause you fucking made 'Chum' and got all personal that niggas won't go back to that old fucking 2010 shit about talking 'bout fucking everything-all. No, fuck that, nigga, I got you. Fuck that

Grab mittens, who have to spit blizzardous
Actually, flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs
(Bitch-ass niggas!)

Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
50k for the last check
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck, nigga it's the mothafuckin'
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

Yeah, the misadventures of a shit-talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist-launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like pigs' posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty-scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick 
Thaw it out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit

Posing nigga try to disrespect
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak
'Cause it's the G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Looking bummy, posted on the block, like I ain't make
A quarter million off of socks, nigga
'Cause it's the G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G, G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

Grief,"I Don’t Like Shit, I Don’t Go Outside: An Album by Earl Sweatshirt",2015.0,"Alright
Uh, uh, uh

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
Step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it
Don't give a fuck, pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel
We had females come in every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob, scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand
Steady handling my job, time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent nigga's shit

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute

Momma taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga

My fleeting thoughts on a leash
For the moment, high as fuck
I've been alone in my shit, for the longest
Snakes sliding in the street
Momma taught me how to not be like the bodies lying in them
Pigs, riding in 'em
I'm a target so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight
Like a collar when you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama, find a bottle
I'mma wallow when I lie in that
I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-grief-lyrics

And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?

And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it

Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet,
 
pull my knife out

They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is

But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope

Non-cooperative with his momma's wishes for college
And coppers labeled a  problem since paying for Damianos
So shimmy through the swamp, nigga, follow me through the foxholes
Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 P.M. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented, stupid, as the group is, only slightly
Write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth

When he walk in the room it's like God is here

At civilians...I'm chilling

I'm on the monitor nigga

I'm on the couch where that loud is burning
I'm shouting, ""I don't fuck with you"" cause I don't
Never love a ho
But we could play doctor, ma, open wide for thermometer
Your cowgirl's crotch riding with a clean, faded fro, lopsided
Tell the label that I want a white driver
And tell him give me space, I don't know that nigga
Bold-ass little fuckin' low-class villian
Whole van tinted, nope can't kill him
It's the Trashwang nigga, that's what's up
Half pint of hope in that plastic cup
Real nigga from the start 'til the casket shut
Present his own case as a basket one
Present-day based nigga, smack the judge
Riding with them same niggas ashin' blunts
While that bass make his face like he mad or somethin'
Slide in the safe, take the cash and run
Know that if he fake I'm harrassin' him
Took the big toe so they tagged the tongue
Out here stuntin' like I'm supposed to, dog
Blowing more smoke than a broke exhaust
Pipe only spirit that I hold's menthol
It's Wolf Gang bitch, like you know these paws
Living like it's '62, spit and grip my genitals
My bitch'll split the Swisher, my niggas split them residuals

Blaring Gil Scott Heron while we pill pop
Errand run and kill cop

Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man's game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

Kept his sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement
Covered trussled drugs, toughen up

Alright, okay

And that neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda
Ragged with the contra, 
Phantom of the Opera
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out
Toe-tagged, don't gag, spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's danger
I'm a manger-born puppy, 
holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea, spit scabies and bet
The label don't like me, but they pay me a grip
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
Y'all niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming and miss

I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch
We could do this shit all night
I'll fuck the freckles off your face, bitch

I'm couch-drunk and ready to fuck, count fetti and bucks
Pack loud as that slap 'cross the belly
What's up? Fuck nigga, what's up? 
I'm at the deli
Scheming on a Fanta and a Camel Crush, 
screaming, ""Saddle up!""
Like, ""Fuck is beef?"" Get your cattle cut, pansy
If them fans only local, why them flights transatlanti'ed up?
The rice and the patties cooked nice for the chancellor
Them teeth with the gold bright, the light switches mad at us
Snapchatting panty-clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
I'm high and polite 'cause po-lice is in back of us

Last autumn the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit

Chasing these rabbits, whole face in a faucet

Shrunk and widen with the bumps in my personal finance

Was the worst, cause I smashed all the trust
That I earned in the past couple months that we had as a couple
My absence of fucks was a problem that we ain't ever
Really get to solve, we just smashed and we scuffled

I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn, then
Paused to scratch and itch, and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it
With this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag
And split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps, a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four

Not like a family of four, just like...

I’m on my séance shit, I’m tryna' make a million dollars
Keep it hood while crossing over on some A.I. shit
I need a foreign baby momma to match a nigga model whip
Ramona Park made me from scratch, a lot of lotto picks lost
Inside this game we call rap, I be the underdog
Bullet hit his forehead, it exit out his under arm
Ain’t nobody bigger than my hood, my nigga, fuck a boss
Baby momma killer, you offended and I fuck her raw
Stretchy doin' federal time for bustin' at the law
And he gonna be a neighbor of mine, you play me for a pawn
Shorty, I be swimmin' with sharks, your posse full of prawns
Pistols rip his body apart, now he afraid of dark alleyways
Niggas better listen when the pastor say

Ugh, hold on, hold on, let me hear me that
Ugh, hold on, hold on, ugh
Ugh, hold on, hold on, ugh

It's Golf on that—bitch, it's Golf on that ball cap
I guzzle the tallboy, Jehovah ain’t call back
And y’all still debating over Earl music
Troops got the group nationwide moving merch units crazy (Nigga)
Peanut butter to paisley, walking down the street
In the different color McGradys, that first-grader was me
Now my fist full of spliffs and the old banker receipts
Bitches grip the stick and jerky like cold shanks of the beef, dry
I’m taking purses like they chances in the evening
Pick your pants up, boy, you dancing with a demon
On my mama, I been limiting my features,
 
filling Swishers up with reefer
Bitch, it's difficult to beat him like a soft dick
Golf clique deep, and we don't hit the streets passive
That nigga Sweaty got the gas and Shreddy K brought the matches
Pitch your body in the water like a Lipton tea bag and then
Switch to a different fuckin whip to let them piggies speed past 'em
It's the rats, tryna get the cheese
What it do? Rap like I'm mincing meat
Call me Lou, if I'm on the track, these niggas skip to me
Niggas want to fade me, bitches feel some type of way for me
50s in my pocket falling out like fucking baby teeth
Vince be with the rocket, he gon' pop it when it’s danger 'round
Fingertips to tapers now, salute us when you face us
Give a fuck about the moves all these loser niggas making now",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-wool-lyrics

Lost in a whirlwind, 2012 quality
High up until the world ends, doing eighty-five in my ride

I ain't lying when I'm rhyming, rule these niggas like a tyrant
Damn, Doms, it don't even seem like you trying
Know these niggas crucify 'em, couldn't crack him, I'm a diamond
I know that niggas is finding my progression so uncommon
The pressure I'm still applying until I hear the angels crying
Sad day in Hell for those who doubted, hope your head explode
Cry about it, but don't deny that Doms got the realest flows
My eyes is feeling low, pulling on the killer 'dro
Chilling with a vixen, thinking ""This is what I did it for""
Still banging, Wolf Ganging as if you niggas didn't know
Still trifling, Loiter Litter Life and triple sixing, ho

Doms, Doms
Doms

While they ripping through the packaging to grab the shit
I'm shaded with the few whom I usually blow cabbage with
New patterns patty-caking with mannequins
'Cause I don't like my fucking homies dip, bruh, they all
Jaw-slacking, all 'em awe struck
And I ain't got shit but a pretty bitch and cigar tucks
Riding in the city and knocking out in the Starbucks
I swear these niggas is fucking phony, smoking spliffs
And that's, prior to arriving to the studio
Eyes glued to a gluteus maximus, attractive lady
Where you headed with that shit?
And can a real nigga get a look at it?
Crook, panic-shook, ain't ya?
Blunt fatter than some butch ankles
Cheffing, fit the cook apron, ante up for good payment
Run until my foot achy, running 'til my foot aching
Full-grown terror type, Ferragamo do-rag
With my nigga Travy out in Maui, running two-mans
Smoking 'til I'm loopy as a motherfucking toucan
Twenty minutes, burn a fucking quarter back to two grams

It's Early, running with niggas who cold running shit
The wins like lotion, he get 'em, he gone rub 'em in
Critics pretend they get it and bitches just don't fuck with him
I spent the day drinking and missing my grandmother, just
Grab a glass and pour some cold white wine in it
Or Colt .45 in it, you know how I get it

You could see it in my face, I ain't been eatin', I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out the gutter, mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, when and if the pen hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch in my space
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain
One foot stuck in a tar pit of my ways

Stay in it, alright..? (faded, I'm stayin' in...)

Give me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love him
To tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be druggin'
To tell the truth, I'm not supposed to be off in here
I'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'

Sack swinging like Dub-D40 on a door hinge
Good Lord, walk light like the floor slick
Look bored, hoard all mics in a force grip
Pro-abortion, endorsing his own importance
Or leaving opponents floating with paper and dirty porcelain
Pinnacle of titillating crisp spit
Fist clenched, emulating '68 Olympics
Rock it from the cradle 'til he middle-age and limp-stick
Coughing from the stable probably indicating spliff's lit
Dismissed, feel it in that saturated cranium
Heavy as insurance off a spanking new laser gun
Crazy heart, hazy lung, making art, raking funds
Crowd going dumb like Palin's son, ugh

No insurance for your pride

Then throw some D onto all available open mics
Smoke it right, proposing these niggas over
Wipe more because I normally toilet-bowl with a broken pipe

The token sober kid stressed, so the role was switched
Four Lokos down the hole and a loaded spliff
And who was useless as a broken wrist when tryna open shit
Nigga, cold is what you need to keep the poultry in
Resulting in me rolling slick as bottom of the bowling kicks
Early Man, you posers know me as the troll
Throwing moldy donut holes at your grody ho
From his cronies' whip
Eating like the kids when you take ‘em off Ritalin
Throwing temper tantrums at the window of your whip again
Sweeping up the glass to use it as a garnish over tacks
Damaged like the leg he limping to the barn with
Chickenshits
Temper 'bout as thick as tips of pencils is
Missiles to the picket fence
Who spit as good as finger-lickin’, bitch?
Bet it's 36 fish netted like the hook was inefficient

The Night Striker, I'm riding her, up-tying her
It's nine Vicodins stuck inside of the windpipes of her
A little bit of sherm sure provokes the fuckin' fight in her
She started bitin' cause I'm givin' cock like it's advice to her

You crazy for this one!

Fresh out the belly of the island into the heart of the city
T and them just hit the road, I had Sage and Nak and 'em with me
I thought the fauna was pretty so I approached her (I did)
My first apartment was really covered with roaches
Cause niggas was really smoking
Gotta say that as of late I been busy with business mostly
Got a tape? Catch a wave, now you in the industry ocean
Missing out on your boat
I been figuring out my own fish, home gets distant
We working, I'm on the road again
Cold and the spirits is bursting up out the Trojan, man
Fridge full of spirits in the crib, mirror, mirror
Let me hear why the niggas that's the peers see and hear us
Then mimic the fucking motions, man
Keep the circle close, let them niggas front in the cul-de-sacs
Friendly with the chosen, the rest is getting the poker hand
Face-drinking smoker, it help me duck when emotion jab
Fame is the culprit who give me drugs without owing cash
Sipping 'til I melt
Devil trying me, I'm dodging, falling victim to myself
Middle finger to the help
When it's problems, I don't holler, rather fix 'em on myself
When it's looking like it's quiet for you, this the shit to yell
This the shit, right, yup, keep your chin high up
Cause when she ain't fucking with you then her friend might
Let you get up inside, yup, let this shit ride, yup
You don't get it rocking like we do on this side, nigga

Aye
Aye
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper (yup)

Feel this cage when that acid fade
Face the same, but your mind has changed
You desire a stable home, I acquire fame at naming hoes
Contemplating ways of getting dome
Plotting on my neighbors
Asking God for favors, guess he isn’t home
Probably 'cause that fucking faith I didn't show
Skipping church, flip the work
Hit the dirt like Tommy Drummond, bitch
Grew up in a home that papa wasn’t in
Came up off of work that my conscience wasn't in
Either way it goes, a lot is getting hit
And if it wasn’t hoes, then it probably was a lick
Got burners on my soul, and my posse on my skin
Sweaty, D-A-Dolla, top lotto picks
Promise that I'm not the one to fucking plot against
Love him, but my father ain't my motherfucking friend
Trying to figure out how to start a motherfucking end
Huh, trend dodging, keep a bitch by me, 
bank roll
Garbage bag full of sins,
 
cleanse my soul to rap still, nigga
Cash is in hand, packs get vac sealed,
 
like the Tin Man
Cardiac still missing, is it past real, get it, work, make Guinness

Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, can't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, you fucking with some grown ups
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where I been
Never trust these hoes, can't even trust my friends
Tell that bitch to roll up, you fucking with some grown ups

See my daddy in the way I'm acting and my facial features
Just trying to put you on, 
dawg, I came from teachers
Take the plate and clean it, nigga, I'm a dog
Tell her ""hit or miss me with the fucking monologue""
Lord, I can't fight it, know I'm tryna brawl

Flashin' grandmama rings on her fingers and fondle the thing
Hollow with glee
Not ominous but James Harden D
Weak niggas guarding will peak
Followers just like me
I lost my phone and consequently
All the feelings I caught for my GF
My hands was on her wings
I took 'em off, had a story careen against the bars
My canteen was full of the poison I need
The trip as long as steep
My innocence was lost in the East
Amidst the thick exhaust
Ahki hit the horn, it beep
Mention my sentence is strong
We all that we need
But don't call me brother no more
I keep my sentences short
Stack Pendleton keep me warm in the winter
Ksubi's cuff done hit the floor
Doobie Brothers where the city morgue
Who would truly love a visit from us?
My soul and my heart
All in it, keep fishing
Gone, the macabre finish
And miss my Pop dukes, might just hit me
Depending how I play my cards
The wind whispered to me, ""Ain't it hard?""
I wait to be the light shimmering from a star
Cognitive dissonance shattered and the necessary venom restored
As if it matters if you think it matters anymore
'Cause shit be happening with quick results
They couldn't fathom all the damage that had to get done
Piglets in a barrel we cookin' up
Don't get a sparrow, no harrowed runics in that there tomb
And a share of deadly flowers bloom

Don't tell me they don't hunt us for sport

No cuddles, the bases is all covered
Niggas come in the door and smoke somethin'
Choke up on the slugger from home run-ins
Nigga it's on, chest thump, his head thump on the floor
We pressed up on the boy, no more bluffin'
Cold summers, 
don't tussle with strangers
Some of those keep one in the chamber
Three spliffs had my wing tips clipped, I was stuck in a hangar, nigga
Muffle my pain and muzzle my brain up
Really, I'm just makin' sure my promise is kept
Chuck a deuce if you know it's the end
Kept the truth in my palm and my chest

Scratch her off my list, the situation bias
She made me a milkshake and forced me to try it
Nah I ain't Nas get the fuck off my dick
Besides from the smell of it I'm hating the flavor
Last night for the hell of it I raped her neighbor
Bit her fillings all through my vampire teeth saber

Lost my dawg to the staircase

took the highest spot on the podium
Ghostin' niggas, probably smokin' to the thought of knowin' us
They loss a part of growin' up
Spurned us, 
learned I had to keep a wedge to get out of the rough
Fuses clipped for nuisance, disrespect 'cause we carried enough
I promised I'd bury the grudge, preparing the carrion grub
Larry Oops
, I was lost in the alley, in the air but not sunk
I spun 'til the lost of my grandmama buried the dunk
Send 'bout a prayer a month, through the above
Niggas moody but imbued with the funk
Better shit to do than play with food
The rhyming Rubik's for fun
But I do what I want, ayy
And I rue what it was later, a looter as such
Confusingly up with paper
I'm shootin' ones with the judge if he sentence my brother
Been with him, muzzled us from the cradle
So we goin' to the grave with this shit
If we join the second line
The ancestors'll hand us a drum to load the second time
Somethin' scary 'bout airin' out the shit I compressed
The fare gettin' fairer now, the cost is
An arm, leg, an arm, leg, and a head
In all bread, the conquest for text
, I'm pawnin' the rest
My Bompton partner spawn when donning the red
I'm all on they neck 'til my car park is pardoning French
Spar with a few niggas, sparkin' at the larger percentage
What's alternate when the losses come as often as wins?
And imposter clique thick
Don't got a job, I only ball off pick-six
I'm fraught with friction, in July, we had shit lit as Christmas
Hollins been sensed niggas been lyin', but we ain't gon' mention
Boo hit the stu' and started sweating', told her this the kitchen
You knew the rules
And we knew how to shoot the loopholes, jugo, beaucoup loot
And my kin and 'nem got the cannon, you gon' juke or 
boogaloo?
I been spinnin' around the answer
Non-definitive, I just crammed it
Outward gifted, inward feel damned
I took my lumps, my bruises, grooves
What the fuck are you to do?

Every time a nigga didn't spot me
I had to figure out my own thing
Now we at the precipice droppin'
Harry Potter with the Dub-D's
Magic hands, nigga, what cheese?
Had a chance, didn't crush me
We gon' get it by all means
Rest in peace to my Ras G
Raw Fruit in the box
, seeds
Let go, then I got wings
I'm seein' red, I'ma charge
You seein' red 'cause you salty
I keep the tears out my mind reach
I put my fears in a box like a prayer that you won't read
Spirited Away
 the whole thing
Peerin' away, I won't leave
See you starin' into old beefs
Ticket booths where they told me
Thickest thorns on the roses
Pistons roarin' like I'm Rasheed
Pistons roarin' like I'm Ben Wallace
Pistons roarin' like Chauncey
Fill up somethin'  'cause I been drivin'

Doobie and a passport, standing where the path forks

Runnin' after shit, I think I want to double back
Devil hittin' my peripherals, start laughin' (Yeah)
Goin' off of what I know and wanna see from that
Growin' up I know I changed, know that things happen
Looked the man in his face
Dreads in the way and on his chains
Gold ride it in a day, forgot his name
But he told me, ""Never change,"" we parted ways (Uh, uh)
I had to face what the man in the mirror says
Grew complacent with the human that I was
Angels sittin' on my dome, had to recognize
All the feelings I disguise, it's there when I bleed
Eyes to my feet, can't stand what I see

World 'round me steady crumblin' (Crumblin')
World 'round me
World 'round me (Steady)
World 'round (Me)

Made a home outta house, lotta closet room
Bones stackin' like dominoes
Catacombs, after the glow, the battle carry on
Get all that malice out your soul, the efficacy strong
I finish what I start, the funeral was hella long
I fell asleep, the effigy was short
My effervescence lost, but not entirely, I shrug the venom off
Kept a tiny piece for times we in the war
I like to think of life as deep, chilly water (Water)
We in it, feelin' warm, swimmin' upstream
Fuck is niggas on?
Icicles hangin' in my heart, caging your strays
Stay away, I hate to say they made me a dog
Anxious, movin' at a pall bearer's pace
My family flanked me in the rain
Enemy of the state, fuck a allegation
Caskets and cradles to the grave and back again
Thanks to the source of the creation
The match fixed like a batch of fresh lemonade
They still couldn't fade us
How much shrapnel can your soul take?
The visions wasn't shabby at an angle
A phantom face in the hallway, incarnations
Angels, aura coordinated with the fifth to the floor
Let's go half on a baby, I'm just playin', of course
I'm just sayin', maybe, later on? (Maybe)

I got the, whole world 'round me
Whole world 'round me crumblin' in my vision
Whole world 'round me
I got the whole world 'round me crumblin'
I just standin' in my pivot (Whole world)
Whole world round me

Whole world 'round (Whole world 'round me crumblin')",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-whole-world-lyrics
Fuck This Christmas,UnKnown,2010.0,"Welcome to my home, the place that I hate
The place that I love, the Planet of the Apes
The place that I loathe, the boy minus father
Equals boy minus heart, always testing mama
Mic sessions thrash, life lessons trashed
Nights get cold as the knife that I grab
Zoom to your wife room take her life with a stab
Sure her ass look nice, it'd look nicer in a bag
And slung over shoulder, village slum soldier
Bayonet bloods when my cup runneth over
With sith lord dark side of the force
In the trunk of a Porsche tryna butt fuck Yoda
Shotgun, drop T, Earl flow shogun
Jabbing with a pen while you faggots getting toes done
Hold up, I was four going on grown up
So before you niggas tell me I'm nuts, you better grow some, faggot

Fuck this Christmas
Fuck this Christmas (Nigga fuck Santa Claus)
Fuck this Christmas
Ain't nothing for you (Ain't no gift for you)

Crazy mothafuckas in the North Pole causing ruckus
And the punk nut-crackers couldn't cuff us, how I fuck her
It was quiet how I stepped in, I crept in with my cock out
Now she's having make-out sessions with my weapons
Drunk a fifth of eggnog, stole Santa's reindeer
Joy-rode the North Pole, steering is a bitch so
I hopped out and ask some Jasper elves for some info
Where I can burn some Christmas trees with large amounts of thick snow
I've been acting naughty problem child in attendance
John Ritter said he taught me how to mothafuck a Christmas
Dismissing all the wanting and the presents are forsaken
See if you're the gift from God then I'm the Christmas wrap from Satan


You, bitch you can't get nothing
No more, no more presents, no more cranberry sauce
Bitch you can't get nothing no more
No more fleeces for your caprices and shit
Bitch give me my mothafuckin' presents back, ain't none for you
Alright for real, you gon' have to give me my fucking presents back

When the wind blow, feds want your info
Streets full of sink holes, sheets full of nymphos
Brains like a baseball, legs like some pencils
Head for the hills, cause I'm on your heels
Like a bloodhound trained to your scent

Dogs comin' to search the car, that's ironic 'cause
Every verse just serve the purpose of a service dog

A lot of niggas poultry, I see chicken and I roast it all
A nigga livin' in the moment, no remarks, just a question
""Why you lookin' for some innocence you know you lost?""
Engine runnin', pistons spittin' like it's motocross

Catch me on the couch unwindin'

Off a pack that my Uncle Al provide me

Be a man and just focus
Get you a plan and you get your shit split like divorce
Only throw hands when you stuck in a jam

Pissed 'cause I missed him

I'm roasting it
Other half I spent homeless on the road with a spliff
So coast to my shit
Toast to my wits when I'm gone wit em
Trimming the hedge, cobra don't live in my yard
Close to the edge, no holster the blick in my palm
I'm watching my step and holding my head
For home where the hopelessness sit
All of them roaches when you open your fridge
It's in your bones, it's what show in your ribs
Only if you're strong you resist
I'm groping my pen-stroke to fit the globe in my lens
I owned up to shit I know that I did
I hope this motion bring me close to content

He was cheesy from back then, I see it now
Speaking down to my demons
Like big dogs, you a mouth breather in denial
SIG Sauer, the heat seeker
Sittin' down with my lawyer for a brief meeting, laying all the pieces out
I think I'd call it mourning, grief rebound
12 months, couldn't form a decent smile, chest heaving
Death reeking in a pile
Eventually I'll leave the house

Now you see me, now you don't
At the same time, hurdling what I had to
I learned to adapt, way better than I could plan
Now you need me, now I'm gone, pack my feelings up and go
Plant the seedling of some hope

We stayed in LA, that's hard liquor and fame, women
You skinny, you weight lifting,  and gain tension
See, me, I was raised different
Black elite beatin' down your block with the bass kickin'
Highway to hell with the tank empty
Niggas faces never was pain stricken
Even though that heart 'bout as dark as the days endin', remain tinted

Fade to black, grey to white
Hungry like I need a motherfuckin' place to stay tonight
Out the water screaming ""Fuck a satiated appetite""
Sweatshirt got the block hotter than some cajun spice
'Bout as hot as bacon pop
Steam a couple hundred spliffs my nigga Sagan copped
Scheming on a mouth full of gold and some pagan thoughts
Drinking, head spinnin' like dreidel top
Keep my eyes open like the gate is on a vacant lot
So I can see these shady niggas soft as baby apricots
Reassert I'm hard as conversation with a racist cop
Out the stomach, hit the ground runnin' and I'm stayin' in socks
Junk still shakin', tell Lativa send a baker box
Plus, ill circa bag, lunch and a bus pass
Tatted half cabs in the shadow of a mustache
Double cuff kakis and a sale price Huf hat
Pushin' down Fax, lookin' dirtier than smudged glass
But that was as an ashy sophomore
Cashed his first check and finally learned what them pockets for
Profit, lock it down, that's word to apartment doors
Coke and soda rockin' 'til it's harder than some mommas' chores
Ridin' 'round town shotgun in a armored Ford
Doin' drive-bys armed with nothing but a sharpened sword
Wolf Gang before you ask me what I'm barking for
Plus the fuse sorta similar to John Stockton's shorts
VERSION 2:
Don't blink, bitch
Real niggas on the brink of extinction
Livin' like he on a mothafuckin' hit list
Gunnin' for your bitch next, finnin' off a pissed ex
Declining your lips stretched
Mr. Anonymous probably sent your clique threats
Fist full of dollars, that collar sit on his thin neck
And most imitate me, I'm popular, so I trend set
The smoke irritating my ocular while the pen jets
Plane switch lit as these lane switchin'
High as your praise given and daddies who stayed distant

Real Love,UnKnown,2017.0,"We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love

Oooo woo, When I met you I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love

Love so true, and oh baby, I thought that love was true
I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong maybe I’ll find a
Real love

So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God He’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love
(Chorus)
See I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way cause it seems he can't be found

Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I’m out to have a real love",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-real-love-lyrics

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

Yeah, yeah
Look love, I'm mesmerized by you
Saw a little dimple and I knew I had to try you in the book of love
My name’s is right next by you and I knew it was meant to be
And I see you're into me
I tag ""love"" on the wall, was 12/1/08
With the heart and all in the bathroom stall, the rebel type
On the first flight to the Moon, that's where we should go
Just love a little lust, God please forgive me
While he hits me, look at her hips and lips, B
Beautiful like the sunset we
Together and, we see, the Sun
But we just have to run, yeah
Her voice harmonizes to my life
Once I hear, everything is, um, balanced and nice
She’s like ice on a summer day
She make me think of when to stray
She's the reason I'm having a great day

I said honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry, that's my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
Nigga slide though

""Wake up son, good morning""
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn
Then paused to scratch an itch and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in, thought jumped in my head
School was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention 'cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But mama wasn't havin' it, so I grabbed my bag and split out the door and saw the whore that I’d rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it’s the hash, I mean the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I’m the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it jaws hit the floor so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
She's gorgeous
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
She’s gorgeous
Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs

Chuck a deuce if you know its the end
Kept the truth and my palm in my chest
See a dude keep a noose hanging off of my neck

We got the juice niggas corny as shit
We on the loose niggas know what it is
We making moves, you niggas corny as shit
We got the juice niggas know what it is (yeah)

Days like these we know there is no hope, or at... Days like these we know there is no hope, or at least none that we can trust, all the old ways are dead or dying, and this is as it should be",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-earl-sweatshirt-unreleased-chamber-lyrics
Hat Trick (CDQ),UnKnown,2019.0,"Give until I can't give
I lend a hand if it's needed
But these stabs got me bleeding out my back, kid
Uh, keep it on the fumble, we could sack shit
Hat trick, we considered Mulligan's for that shit
The proof is in the pudding and the pamphlets
The sewer and the mattress, stupid nigga, you could get it
Uh, only thing certain is these taxes
Burn me when the journey ends
Clergyman, turn me into ashes
I move surgically, with new sermons for the masses
We too purpose for the scraps
What the verdict read, is that courtesy of shit circumstances
The earth is my turf but the hearse like a magnet
I'll be outside in some handcuffs, I'll be outside in the dirt, uh
Gentrifies, got your turf getting hacked up
Late nights, thinking 'bout who lied to me first
Graveyard energy, I'm tied to the job
Strictly based off principle
My inner jit grinnin', but my face all twisted
It's the artist at work
Greyhound tickets and some haze on my missus
No, it make no sense to keep my heart on my shirt
But when the rain storm's vicious, spend the day blowing, drinking
Trying to harvest the hurt, but it make no difference",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-hat-trick-cdq-lyrics

WHOLE WORLD (feat. Maxo),UnKnown,2020.0,"Runnin' after shit, I think I want to double back
Devil hittin' my peripherals, start laughin' (yeah)
Goin' off of what I know and wanna see from that
Growin' up I know I changed, know that things happen
Look a man in his face
Dreads in the way and on his chains
Gold ride it in a day, forgot his name
But he told me, ""Never change,"" we parted ways (uh, uh)
I had to face what the man in the mirror says
Grew complacent with the human that I was
Angels sittin' on my dome, had to recognize
All the feelings I disguise, it's there when I bleed
Eyes to my feet, can't stand what I see

World 'round me steady crumblin' (crumblin')
World 'round me
World 'round me (steady)
World 'round (me)

Made a home outta house, lotta closet room
Bones stackin' like dominoes
Catacombs, after the glow, the battle carry on
Get all that malice out your soul, the efficacy strong
I finish what I start, the funeral was hella long
I fell asleep, the effigy was short
My effervescence lost, but not entirely, I shrug the venom off
And kept a tiny piece for times we in the war
I like to think of life as deep, chilly water
We in it, feelin' warm, swimmin' upstream
Fuck is niggas on?
Icicles hangin' at my heart, cagey, a stray
Stay away, I hate to say they made me a dawg
Anxious, movin' at a pall bearer's pace
My family flanked me in the rain
Enemy of the state, fuck a allegation
Caskets and cradles to the grave and back again
Thanks to the source of the creation
The match fixed like a batch of fresh lemonade
They still couldn't fade us
How much shrapnel can your soul take?
The visions wasn't shabby at an angle
A phantom face in the hallway, incarnations
Angels are coordinated with the fifth to the floor
Let's go half on it baby, I'm just playin' of course
I'm just sayin'...
Maybe later on?

Whole world 'round me
Whole world 'round me crumblin' in my vision
Whole world 'round me
I got the whole world 'round me crumblin'
Whole world 'round me
Whole world 'round me (crumblin')
Whole world ('round)
Whole world 'round (sum'n crumblin')",https://genius.com/Earl-sweatshirt-whole-world-feat-maxo-lyrics
