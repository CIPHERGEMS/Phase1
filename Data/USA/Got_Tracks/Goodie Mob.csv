Cell Therapy,Soul Food,1995.0,"When the scene unfolds, young girls 13 years old
Expose themselves to any Tom, Dick, and Hank
Got more stretch marks than these hoes
Hollin' they got rank
See SEGA ain't in this new world order
Dem experimenting in Atlanta, Georgia
United Nations, overseas, trained assassins
Do search and seize, ain't knocking or asking
They're coming for niggas like me, poor white trash like they
Tricks like her back in slavery
Concentration camps laced with gas pipelines
Infernos outdoors like they had back
When Adolf Hitler was living in 1945
Listen to me now, believe me later on
In the future look it up, where they say it in the Constitution?
That in the event of a race war
Places like Operation Heartbreak Hotel
Moments tear until air tight vents sealed off despair
Dem say expect no mercy
Fool, you should be my least worries
Got to deal with W-2's, 1099's
Unmarked black helicopters swoop down
And try to put missiles in mines

Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Me and my family moved in our apartment complex
A gate with a serial code was put up next
The claim that this community is so drug free
But it don't look that way to me, 'cause I can see
The young bloods hanging out at the store 24/7
Junkies looking for a hit of the blow, it's powerful
Oh, you know what else they tryin to do?
Make a curfew especially for me and you
The traces of the new world order, time is getting shorter
If we don't get prepared, people, it's gon' be a slaughter
My mind won't allow me to not be curious
My folk don't understand so they don't take it serious
But every now and then, I wonder if the gate was put up
To keep crime out or keep our ass in

Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Listen up, lil nigga, I'm talking to you
About what yo little ass need to be going through
I fall a victim too and I know I shouldn't smoke so much
But I do with the crew every day
On the average 'bout four or five, I'm lucky to be alive at sunrise
Now I realize the cost after I lost my best friend Bean
I recognize as a King
Who am I to tell you to stop smokin?
Now you're open to disease and colds
And ain't 16 years old, this shit has got to stop
Let's take a walk through detox, I want outta this hole
I'm in a cell under attack, loc up folks
They in the hood, got an eye on every move
I make open your face to info you ain't know 'cause it's kept low
How the new world plan reach the planet without the black man

So what's your aim? Try to separate me from the blood
Is disrespect like coming in my home
And not wiping your feet on the rug
The Citron Absolut has got me bucking, no hang with no phony
Look out for the man with the mask on the white pony
On my back are bills staying off my toes, always on my heels
Insane, plain soldiers coming in the dark by plane
To enforce the new system by reign
Tag my skin with your computer chip
Run your hand over the scanner to buy your dish now
No more fishing for your fish
Kiss the days of the old days past ways gone
Mind blown, conception, protection
My name on your selections but I caught you coming, pow

Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)
Who's that peeking in my window?
Pow, nobody now (nobody now)

Dirty South,Soul Food,1995.0,"One to da two da three da four
Dem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door
And they got everybody on they hands and knees
And they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys

Now if dirty Bill Clinton fronted me some weight
Told me to keep two, bring him back eight
And I only brought him five and stuck his ass for three
Do you think that Clampett will sick his goons on me?
See Martel Homes, that's my claim to fame
That's where I learned my slickest tricks in the dope-d-game
Like my favorite, I call it ""Lemonhead Delight""
That's when you lick off all the yellow and you sell the white.

Right, well if pimpin' be a sport I be bein' the wide receiver
That nigga B-I-G will make ya'll niggas believers
Sippin' on Cuervo Gold off in the club drunk as fuck
Callin' them hoes bitches, and smokin' my weed up
When I'm too sober, year older, now I'm almost legal
Wanted to live the life of Cadillacs, Impalas and Regals
Fuckin' around wit hoes, bustin' nuts in they mouths
Kickin' that same southern slang
Lookin' for love off in yo' jaw, ho!

See powder gets you hyper; reefer makes you calm;
Cigarettes give you cancer; woo woo's make you dumb
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?

See never did I think when I got grown
That some pee wee sacks had been done took this town
See, life's a bitch, then you figure out
Why you really got dropped in the Dirty South
See in the 3rd grade this is what you told
You was bought, you was sold
Now they sayin' Juice left some heads cracked
I betcha Jed Clampett want his money back
See East Point Atlanta threw this road block
Talkin 'bout all this blow traffic got to stop
So the big time players off John Freeman Way
Had to find themselves another back street to take
'Cause back in the day we was outta control
We didn't understand, ""Naw nigga, that money ain't yours""
That's when me and Big Slate took an oath and sweared
Never would we talk, never would we tell
So when they pulled up bumpin' ""Rock The Bells""
We took what we want and left them quiet as hell
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?
What you niggas know about the Dirty South?

Now that Cobras got the boys on Delowe on they back
Gipp hollered at Miss Ann, she said they didn't get trapped
Behind the black, behind green, behind the red tint
Dealers breaking off that blow up for those woodchips
A lot of faces ain't around, a lot of folks got shot
Scatta Mack droppin' G's while that Cristal pop
Been on the grind with Cool Breeze, droppin' pounds with B
Eric Neal is the coolest from my century
Mack town keeps growing, old school like Charles
Stankin' like dem Lincolns in Piedmont Park
Perry Homes to Herndon Homes, to all the Homes
Adamsville to Poole Creek, shit, just don't sleep in the Dirty South
One to da two da three da four
Dem dirty Red Dogs done hit the door
And they got everybody on they hands and knees
And they ain't gonna leave until they find them keys

Black Ice (Sky High),Still Standing,1998.0,"Do you ever see that stuff that be
When it get cold
That ice that you can't see?
See that shit happens sometimes
Yep
Black ice

Now you know and I know
I done bumped every hole in the wall, y'all
Did you catch that phone call?
Most of y'all that met me thought I was tall
Gipp flipped like a dip, slipped, fell on the black ice
Did you think twice? Homeslice came and he went
Satisfied, got bent, bars ain't shit
Mutant, coast to coast, yeah, I laughed and boast
Man, do-si-dos, too many comin' close to

Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun
Sky high, sky high

Circulate like a Sunday paper
Capers caught long time, to cheap flicks, good picks
Paid hard, watch the hard turn sideways
Cook the 'tail for real sales to those who lose cash
Players keep your life for now
Feeling good and warm, windows rolled tight
Thirty-five degrees, nippy tonight
Don't forget the ChapStick, lips dry quick
When the jack out, make you wanna act out
Take the slack out, some people black out
Hibernatin' 'til we came back out

Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun
Sky high, sky high (Sky high)
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen befo'
Woke up and seen the sun
Sky high, sky high

I been in it for the past few days
Tighter than fades, I'm knowin' my plays
Now can I rap? Can I adapt? Not really sure yet
Who that lookin' over the shoulders of those writin' dreams?
Fiending for the taste of menthol
Missed class, stayed in the hall
Lookin' for a squeeze play, better, yet a holiday
Stayed away from the pyramid board game
Broke it down to a neighborhood slang
Cash before fame

Sky high, sky high
Sky high (Sky high)
Sky high (Sky high)
Sky high (Sky high)
Sky high (Sky high)

Now who done stepped in?
The nigga, the B-I-G, the secret weapon, boi
Slicker than Black Ice, throwin' these flows like rice at weddings
So quit flexing, we speakin' about
Something that's refreshing to the earlobes
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg, Chryslers and Buicks
Some niggas ain't on they jobs so them suckers here to lose it
Abuse they privileges and now the whole village's been shot to pieces (Pieces)
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean that feces
Boy, don't beep me, if you ain't got no work (Work)
I'm strictly 'bout these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy, search, boy
Talking about your dough is long like Lurch, boy
Every time I heard you rhymin' like a fucking jerk, boy; simp
Yeah!

Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain what pertains
To cocaine and sustaining reign
See, summer rolls around, niggas holler bout change
Then they steady move them keys like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individuals' way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone
Making it our own, taking me all wrong
We've all indulged in the bulge of those no-nos
No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people, put 'em in a land of snow

Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun

Thought Process,Soul Food,1995.0,"Let me get a chop at this lumber
Niggas from down Underground they hangin' around the A-Town
Lookin' for a come up, workin' from 9 to 5
Just to get some change so T-Mo can stay alive
Not greedy or livin' lavish yet, but you can bet
That when I do, nobody from my crew will I forget
And if I start to get large and come up on some change
I won't change, everybody know they down
It's not the same, everyday life can be different
These laws got me ready to brawl 'cause I fall a victim
So I still be slangin' them fat pillows to make 'em meet
Each and every day as I comb my city streets
Sometimes I wish I never had been a part of this mess
'Cause the system got us fucked up
It put us to the test, women and men, if you black, you in
Food for the soul, listen to what I tell you
It don't matter young or old, it's time we loc' up
And do like we suppose
We killin' each other over this bullshit and some clothes
We trapped off in this world's society with no place else to go
So how you feel?

Frustrated, irritated
Sometimes I don't know myself, I be too numb
To feel something sometimes, so I dig deep
Get in the Cherokee
Let my mind fly free into the wilderness
So I can get this shit off my mind
That's why I be smokin' that dank sometimes
It keep me from snappin', keeps me calm
Keeps my mind open, keeps me fond
Of what I gots to do off in the studio
To get my old bird back on her feet
And my little bro in Statesboro
And my little cuz Mark Twain, all my folks that hang with me
When I was out in the trap or when I was goin'
Through one of our episodes, only God knows
What I go through, so I get down on my knees
Sometimes I come home too high to pray
But I get on my bed, lay on my back
And meditate, anyway, in the ceiling
The four walls, it's like cell therapy
Got nothing to do but write about my L-I-F-E
Put it down on paper...
Man, so what you feelin' like?

I live for today, motherfuck another hour, it might be sour
Never know my day so I'm prayin' in the shower
Look up and thank the Lord for forgiveness, a witness to bad
I'm lookin' for good in the Southwest, God bless my neighborhood
There's people killin' in the street to eat
Survivin’ the day is the only goal that I set
Just to make it home, I'm not alone
Someone's out to get me when I haven't done shit wrong

My head felt swoll, messed up, couldn't see past my mouth
“What route did you take, man?” Got me by the loops of my pants
Got me on the curb lettin' the traffic pass me by
No questions, I said nothing
Lookin' for the mutant to be buckin' the law, naw man, Gipp
Showed him my shit, closed my mouth then I dip
See to me a G is a person who understands the plan
Can't make no moves when you in the hands of the man
They got some new suites down Peachtree
Left wing for the Feds, right wing for the hardheads
Makin' more deals than Buddy Fowlkes made with Hartsfield
Somebody don't want my face in this place for ‘96, shit's slick
Car be clean lookin' fresh, dog be scratchin' at my chest
Under the order of who? Guess who, ain't none iller
Than Miller, wanna 1-2 your ass
No more life what you gave is the past, cause ain't no future
Wanna “Miller camp” your case, disgrace your face
Make it seem to be safe, ain't no place to run

Sometimes I don't even know how I'm gon' eat
'Bout twenty dollars away from being on the street
Shit, you might see a nigga on TV
But hell, it's almost like I'm rappin' for free
That little money be gone
God dammit, I'm grown
Gotta help keep the heat and lights on
It would be nice to have more but I kinda like bein' poor
At least I know what my friends here for
I wanna lie to you sometimes, but I can't
I wanna tell you that it's all good, but it ain't
It's niggas hurtin' and uncertain about
If they gon' make it or not, that's why we got niggas killing
Feelin' like they comin' up off a little dope they sold
You can get some gold but we won't make it as a whole
'Cause without you, there'd be no me
And without no unity there will never be any happiness
You could smoke a pound of sess
And it still won't relieve your stress
God bless... my thought process

The thought process... Now-
Now as an Outkast, I was born, wasn't warned of the harm
That would come to meet me like Met Life, but yet life
Done sent me through a lot of ups and downs like it ain't nothin'
Like elevators but I ain't the one that's pushin' the buttons
I got off at the 13th floor, when they told me that it wasn't one
They said it skipped from 12 to 14
Still smoking, still drinking
No, I'm sittin' on the Lincoln 4 AM thinking
That in reality the world is like a ball full of players
We trapped off in this maze with walls made of layers
And only prayer is the tightest game that you can have
The devil's takin' a swing, that might explain the broken glass
But my crystal ball see the pistol fall to the wayside
Nobody would die in cops and robbers when we used to play, right?
Huh, the only thing we feared was Williams, Wayne
Never thought about hittin' licks or slangin' 'caine
Did not think I'd be the one to give in to abortion
Label me ""murderer"" because my ass is scorchin'
Hot from the Glock that sits under my seat
Yeah, it's real fucked up that my folks come to get me
And it's like dat...yeah, uh-huh, yeah, and it's like dem!",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-thought-process-lyrics
Soul Food,Soul Food,1995.0,"My old boy from the point
But I'm from Southwest and every
Now and then I get put to the test
But I can't be stopped
Cause I gotta come true ain't got no gun
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Not covered in too much
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Every last Thursday of the month

Daddy put tha hot grits on my chest in tha morning
When I was sick Mary had tha hot soup boiling
Didn't know why but it felt so good
Like some waffles in that morning
Headed back to tha woods
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
I haven't stopped learning yet
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next

Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
Tied face goons surround me like cancer drill
Me with second-hand obstables
But, only to make matters worse
Plus I'm getting pimped by this temp lady Jackie
From Optima staffing figure laughing
Shut up clown don't talk to me
Like that looking stupid of course
Living day by day and you ain't hard
Trick hell you say?

It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
I'm ready to begin
Another chance to get further away from where I've been
But I'll never forget
Everythang I went through I appreciate the shit
Because If I hada went and took the easy way
Wouldn't be the strong nigga that I am today
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul

Come and get yo' soul food, well well
Good old-fashioned soul food, all right
Everythang is for free
As good as it can be
Come and get some soul food

Sunday morning where you reating at?
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Ole' burd working the stove ride
Churches dropping chicken in yesterday's grease
Didn't go together with this quart of Mickey's
Last night hanging over from a good time
Yeah beef is cheaper but
It's pumped with ""red dye"" between two pieces of bread
Shawty look good with dem hairy legs
Wish I could cut her up but, ma stomach come before sex
A house full of hoes now what's the ingredient
Spaghetti plus her monthly flow

They know they making it hard on the yard
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Taking us when we're in the spotlight for a joke
Changing by the day I see it's getting bigga in my square
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
Tameka and Tiffany outside tripping
And skipping rope to the beats from my jeep
As I speak wuz up from the driver seat

A heaping helping of fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Too big for my jeans
Smoke steams from under the lid that's on the pot
Ain't never had a lot, but thankful for
The little that I got
Why not be?
Fast food got me feeling sick
Them crackers think they slick
By trying to make this bullshit affordable
I thank the Lord that my voice was recordable

(Come an get your soul food, well, well)
Hold up C it's what I write
And Miss Lady acting like we in jail
Says she ain't got no extra hush puppies to sell
Bankhead seafood making me hit that door
With a mind full of attitude
It was a line at Tha Beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
Looking to be one of dem days
When Momma ain't cooking
Everybody's out hunting with tha family
Looking for a little soul food",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-soul-food-lyrics

My right leg longer than my left foot
Put stripes next to squares, still peel the circle
See spirits off of people, I don't see color
I'm a special mind, yeah, a special kind
Conceived in the South at a special time
Covered in leaves of gold
Scripture written in scrolls
Spoken so clearly in tongues
So my children would come
Look around
Can't you see
The industry: they look like me

I don't wear the clothes you wear
I'm just different and I don't care
It's kind of sad and it's a shame
Everyone wants to be the same
If you are listening here and now
I'm sure I can show you how
It's okay to be afraid
Don't you want to be special

I'm so special, boy
Tried to went stupid, dumb
I eat nuclear waste and spit atomic bombs
Plutonium explodes, that's my trademark
Mushroom clouds inside, call 'em brain farts
Gamma rays torch my system, now I'm going green
G-force in my veins, pump hydrazine
KT, 13, a microphone beam
Cosmic juggernaut, extraterrestrial being
Reign supreme, once conceived, boy, they broke the mold
All this glory-seeking is getting totally outta control
No one's original, Attack of the Clones
Invasion of the swagger-snatchers
Aim for the dome


Scientists stood around in silence as I was being born
Was I quote, unquote ""special"" or was there something wrong
My skin was black, my heart was gold, and my tongue was silver
And the fact that I could talk already, that was a thriller
And I fear what I don't understand, so let me warn you
Especially when nigga make too much noise about being normal
Unusual but beautiful, the bondin' blessing

I'd rather die than to not be distinguished
The outsiders have no desires to be equal
When V.I.P. stands for ""Very Insecure People""

Beautiful Skin,Still Standing,1998.0,"Mmmm.. this particular song right here is..
Dedicated to the black woman
And it doesn't pertain to all black women
Because some of y'all disrespect y'allself
Because you don't know who you are in the first place
This is out of common respect, for all women period
Word up, like this song, yo

Yo, I'm quite single, and occassionally I mingle
But aside from all the rest, she sparks my interest
No, ma'am, I don't know you
Just offering the common respect I feel I owe you
Also, some conversation, companionship, common-ground and common-sense
There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, OK?
I waited a day *phone rings* Hello?
This is Carlito from a couple of days ago, you sound tired
Forgive me if I've called you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state? Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
I just, wanna be, there's no need to put titles on you and me
Those are limitations, living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time, my mind, just, couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But, in the same breath, a-llow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I, was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass
And, I was very content, and you deserved every complement
Now, remember our indifferences make us the same
You gotta have some game, or, many of you
Won't even be able to take care of yourself, uh
And Love, when I look at you, I see my reflection
So I offer my love, affection and protection
Shawty, you dead fine, but the bottom-line is
You're still my sister
Chorus: Cee-Lo *singing*
Well, I say you're my, beginnin my end
You're my sista lover and friend
God is, your light from within
It shines through your beautiful skin
What they, say bout you ain't true
There's no me if there is no you
I hope, that you understand
You got to respect yourself before I can

Yeah, I met you and y'all knew, saw you again on Marietta
Downtown Atlanta, checkin your long legs, got me smirkin
Fixed me dinner one night, candles lit
Kinda thought you was slick in the beginnin'
But it teurned out you wouldn't lie
Looked me in my eye, I listened
Sucked it up, pushed on, we made amends, both sides clicked
True friends, since then, years done gon by
Brought a baby girl into this world, made our parents grandfolks
Household with no hope, took care of ye, you me
When shit got put out on the curb
Closer than the skin on the back of my hand
Through the thick and thin, we can win
Beautiful black skin
Chorus

No need to compete, with the music loud
Or stairs cold, put on a scale, of one to ten, you a twelve
I chose, her over jail and hell
Originally from ATL

Compatible souls come together, under bad weather
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every wo-man, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only, already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin, lookin for the right female
I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin humble in his approach
Spontaneous with the game
He caught the naive of a girl fallin for the OK
Let the pistol smoke the one you live by
Die by, examples of how relationships can be

I rolls the dice, takin a chance at crappin out
Like today boy, I lost one of my best hips
Natural thick lips, no animal fat implants
Wide load, just started workin at the airport
19 years old, worth more than her weight in gold
But it was all my fault, so don't cry, understand
If down the line I want you back and the feelin ain't mutual
Just promise me you'll find a new man -- that's bout some business
Hope she find what her was lookin for, like a dreamto my end
I wanted to be more than friends

Cause in the SWATS, red hots don't drip or bleed

Cuz, you know me, giving me
Left hand dap, P-funk be riding shotgun
Escort, your window broke out, son
A cool breeze, got my lips chap, morning slap some
Soul in my breadbasket gap contain
X marks the spot, Twain, O.C., the cut laying
A slew of empty gas in my tank
A buck thirty looking ugly, think but it ain't gonna stop no show
Ol' bird putting a buzz in you ear, ""It's gon' snow""
Or maybe perhaps sleet, rap up the beat
Outside barely made it to your wake
Looking like Mr. Fisher, Dickie down, no suit, no tie
Niggas ain't gonna be able to just get by no more
You leaving the hotel, 254

Today was good to me
I went to the Goodwill with the ten dollar bill
Got the London Fog out the back, paid the man
Me and Khujo and T-Boo, three jack lumbers
On the loose, cut your ass Lo like Cee
Be under the water, half these figures around me be hollering Newt
Now what the fuck has this politician did for you?
Complain, complain but Mr. Clampett ain't gon' change
Just rib your ass up just to gut your pockets out
I heard Bill put two G's up for some folks
That they found in they house beat up and I don't discuss
That color scheme that they fall on
'Cause the scheme that they fall on don't match with my tone
See, I wonder will I walk the streets in 1995
And not have to make bond from 254, uh
Will somebody please turn the lights on in 166
I can't see where the fuck I'm going
I can't do shit but get mad
I can't keep get Billy and his uncle out my fucking Goodie Bag

Without your shank you can't thank
Without your niggas you up the creek stank with a ass full of ore
Taking what I say for what it's worth, it don't matter
'Cause how I feel might be triggered from thoughts I had in the past
Now I struggle to reach the sky
Why try so hard if all I'mma get is spit on
'Cause life at the bottom ain't hitting on shit
But some of these folks is getting rich
I know about mine, unwind, can't take at times going through
The same drama that got me here in this state of mind
Red-hot in the summer time

First of all, I stand a little more than five feet tall
But we can still brawl, nigga, I ain't scared at all
I guess you niggas don't know or can't see
That it ain't even wise stepping to me incorrectly
But yet still when niggas feel they can deal
I will split your ass up for real
'Cause we the maniacs with the chunky goodie sacks
So I don't carry an ax but I still swing low with The Lumberjacks
Tracks are being made by Organo-I-Z-E
While we cooling in the shade
Ain't getting paid for chilling, illing, willing
To do what I got to do to come thru your speaker
Cee-Lo, he will never come weaker
Uniquer than a lot of MCs out today
Because I'm more than careful about what I say
When I pick up a microphone it's on
Them better leave me alone, I'm in my zone
Prone to snap if you offer me a chance
Like it when them chunky hoes can dance, I'll enhance
The microphone when it's in my grip, I do not slip
I can't forget my niggas Jo, T-Mo, and Gipp
Ha-ha-ha, well Great Scott, is he a thief?
It seems like he has a mouth full of gold teeth
I smile, because your eyes can't take the glare
But Cee-Lo, him don't care, I cut off all my hair
And everybody stop and stare when we come in the place
And I can get on the mic with no time to waste
Get right up in your face, kick the flavor you taste
And when I'm on the microphone, it's a damn disgrace
How you don't comprehend what I'm saying to you
And I'm the C, the double E from the Goodie Mo Crew
I'm coming thru, I'm coming true, ooh, I can't even stop
It's Cee-Lo B, I'm down with that nigga pop, pop, pop
And my nigga Mike L, and Bert P
And my nigga Pretty Ken, you know he down with me
We from Atlanta, G-A, that is where we stay
I'm digging off in the Goodie Bag each and every day
Ooh shit!!

So put some fire on the ass end of that weed
'Cause in the SWATS, red hots don't drip or bleed

A constant struggle each and every day
Some wonder why I'd rather die
Than to continue living this way
Many are blind and cannot find
The truth cause no one seems to really know
But I won't accept that this is how it's gon' be

Makin' a nigga mo' slow off the doe in Olympian bubblin' under who
Where's the crew thick mist in the trail
I'm feelin' pressure off the tess
Spine 
advertising swine on Channel 2 when in the same breath
You tellin' me don't eat from that plate increasin' my blood
Outbreaks on my skin
 don't blend with the way I want this thang to flow
If I can help the cause don't have to treat it with no tricks
You settin' me cancer on a stick, visualize destruction soon to come
Throwin' within this city we call Atlantis
Prayin' like a mantis everyday ain't good in the woods of Southwest
I stress in my rhymes...fighting for yo' spirit and you mind!

So what it be like my brother be catching gangrene
The water be brown in the morning in my sink
Who that in my eyes some Clampett eaten away by fungi
Another virus disease, at ease, quick to lead a strike against Haiti
When half your army in the bed with pains in their back
And behind their head
Witch doctors giving more Medicaid but ain't no aid
But these ain't tha same from 'Nam, didn't give a damn
Who only wanted Saddam now your hands numb
Can't run old age before thirty
This what you wanted when you signed your (hand) 'cock on tha line
Fightin' for your spirit and your mind, service to my kind...

Seems like we're fighting for our spirit and mind

Multiple stab wounds sticin' thru in the ol' school Cutlass Supreme
Thirty-five cents to my name and that's fo' a blunt man
The way thangs goin' today I might as well be dead, so dread
The voices on the radio got me seamed
Can't put a smile on my face cuz my pockets ain't straight
At least not the way I want 'em to be
Early as phuckk, eight fifty-one
Last night I barely got some Z's ... sleep...uh
I can't ol' Burd in the next room havin' nightmares
It sound like wind blowin' when she weep, speak
I can't I'm tired on the way to the slave camp...
I utter very little words, I'm thinkin' about a ciggy I snatched
From the jaws of death, a sack of crumbled herb ...
Rollin' down Main Street
East Point, I swerve, Campbelton Rd, Southside
Eight fify-five, jacket at bus top standin', sweatin' but, I ain't

Outside it's twenty below fool I'm ridin' to the liquor store
Closed down,that's alright I go holla at this beeso I know
Who work at the Texaco Gas station, pacin' back down memory lane
Feelin' strange can't Explain, so bare wit me pleae

with an I-U-D (intoxicated una dank)
I took two swiggs outts my deuce-deuce, old E
Now Stephen K-I-N-G had the story all wrong
Blood last five points, I'm gone

As individuals and as a people we are at war
But the majority of my side got they eyes open wide
But still don't recognize what we fighting fo
I guess that's what I'm writing for to try to shed some light
But we been in the darkness for so long, don't know right from wrong
Y'all scared to come near it, you ignore the voice
In your head when you hear it
The enemy is after yo' spirit but you think it's all in yo' mind
You'll find a lot of the reason we behind
Is because the system is designed to keep our third eyes blind
But not blind in the sense that our other two eyes can't see
You just end investing quality time in places you don't even neeed to be
We don't even know who we are, but the answer ain't far
Matter of fact its right up under our nose
But the system taught us to keep that book closed
See the reason why he gotta lie and deceive is so
That we won't act accordingly
To get the blessings we suppose to receive
Yeah it's true, Uncle Sam wants you to be a devil too
See, he's jealous because his skin is a curse but what's worse
Is if I put it in a verse y'all listen to some bullshit first
We ain't 
natural born killas
, we are a spiritual people
God's chosen few
Think about the slave trade when they had boats with
Thousands of us on board
And we still was praising the Lord now you ready to die
Over a coat, a necklace round your throat, that's bullshit
Black people ya'll better realize, we losin, you better god damn fight and die
If you got to get yo' spirit and mind back and we got to do it together

Did it, done it, run it, say it how you want it, leave it
When you finished let me dress it up and made it seem sweet
Like a beach in Martinique, Goodie back up on they feet
Set it straight for the nine-eight, license plate with the triple A
Callin all them cars, because the club be goin left and right
Throwin blows like them pros, runnin lows up in the night

And he worked quickly, was it worth it? He didn't deserve it
Predestined weapons for lessons that we learned
HOT, bullets burned

Verse Four: Cee-Lo
Wellllll, my name is Sugar Low, and this is Menta
For years we been some players, what more can I say?
Saturday night at my dance, throw on a few clothes, uhh

Now what they know about the banana and mayonnaise (mayonnaise)
Slices of toasted bread on the nap-kin
Straight up nuts with this country drawl
It ain't no reason lookin for it -- ain't no fuckin flaw
I didn't go to bed without my lucky bear claw
See, I'm a rare stud lookin to bloom like a mushroom
In the jug, under hot lights, crystalize so nice
When I think twice, I love long summer nights
Four records deep, and I still get stage fright
From small towns to the big city night lights

If you don't like what I say, fly away, fly away
If you don't like where I stay, fly away, ahhhhh

Politicians slangin slurs, high from the natural herb
Ain't no runnin from niggas
Everywhere you go, drankin alcohol
Ready to call Earl, it's your world, black man
Them devils can't stand how we makin moves, smooth
Avoidin legal hassles goin unseen
Like the hand that took
Then documented it in his book
How these niggas shook the world with the hook
Now they back like Jack in that red Cadillac

Now GIT, don't let the doorknob hit ya
Where the good Lord split ya
I'm hearin rumors too
That you so gone off that D and PCP, that thoughts
Of lettin another man sample your wine haunts your mind
Look like the color pink
Rubbin elbows with the wrong folks
Makin kin breach they skin
Secretaries terminated after seein the boss pack fudge
Dirty men need to do more than bathe, huh
How's about burned at the stake
Like the rest of those Sodomites
Even though you had beautiful kids and a wife
He still bent both ways, ain't no due process
For boys that become guls or verse vica
Field niggas control this
Pin the hollow point tip
On this gay rights activists
A ghetto game we all familiar wit
Now how many licks, did it take, to get you wet
You ends today, fly away (fly, fly away)

Oh yesh y'all, Sugah he got that silky Southern drawl
Every tooth in my mouth, got gold on em' all

We so deep and quick to stomp a nigga to sleep
And, uh, we dont' like to kill, but we will

Guess Who?,Soul Food,1995.0,"You 'bout to make me slam yo' back clean out
But I luv her till death do us part
Though she divorced my pop the hard way
Back in nineteen ""yassey"" for the past sixteen years
I took on the responsibility of daddy...
Ma ol' burd... puttin a real buzz in my ear, makin sho' it marinate
And not go out the other ear
Guess who? stood beside me when y'all wouldn't force fed when I
Couldn't lift a spoon to my skull
God is good, God is kind mimmicin' her taught me how to say mine ...
Grace improvised wit bakin' soda when it wasn't no toothpaste
Now what that went with?? my ol' burd cried tears of joy
When she heard I wasn't gon' serve time for possession
Of the ""sawed off"" runnin' out of spurs
When I came home blowed and couldn't find the key hole, guess who
Unlocked the doors, my Ol' burd puttin' my hairs out
I better eat before you bug me to death
Shut-up you old ungrateful ass nigga, she trying to help yo' ass...
I wasn't ready to eat yet but I enjoyed the dinner she said, ""I'm glad""
Slid down my esophagus wit ease, even though she have this skin disease
That won't allow me to gain weight do my own eyes deceive me
Guess who tuck me in before I started drivin this Benz
Again & again, told me not to and when I did...
Guess who beat the dog shit outta me kid
My Moma didn't play, shiiit, I had to pick the switches...
You guess who!!!

My Moma, destination unknown, went out on her own
She was barely even grown and became my Moma
I never knew my dad, so even when the times got bad
I was glad cause I had my Moma
For so long she had to be strong
I know at certain times she was wrong
But she still my Moma, it still amazes me
The Lord had to help her raise me judging from the way I used to be
My Moma, the biggest player that I know I love her so
Hell everything I got I owe to my Moma
Thank you for caring, thank you for sharing yo' luv
I guess that was yo' way of preparing
Yo' son to be the one and not the two
To make you and my daddy's dream come true
But what a surprise a car wreck left you paralyzed
The sheet was pulled over yo' eyes when the doctor advised
The family that you might not ever talk again
But you talkin' so I know that you gon' walk again
But take yo time, guess who's the inspiration for the rhyme... My Moma
Who was tha first to hold you in some arms
Tha first to change your diaper when your stomach wasn't calm
Your Moma, wit that drama brought you into this world
From a world of down under
I wonder now she know when I was lying, when I was telling the truth
With the proof she would explain how I've been skipping school
With that boys putting wholes on my back with the same belt
Around my waist that held my panst up
Takin' back only got you closer to Southern Bell
Got your forehead swell
I swear she knew when it was real or when it was fake like Clampetts
With dreads and if I couldn't handle a situation then I fled
Behind closed doors I froze, in Garnett holes I rose
Who that hell got my bond
Standing in front of that two-inch glass
A woman ready to hand the cash over for her son...
My Mama!!
Sometimes we get it on, I know at times I'm wrong
Lookin' into my eyes just to let me know she tried is enough for me
I'm callin' a truce it seems we more like brother and sister
Even though she pay the bills wit the mister
Brought me home in '72 and gave me all she had
Cause I was left at birth she knew it could work
Since she gave me the first chance my song and dance
Pearl, my world, what would I do without her spark
Probably be on the street wit nothin' to eat but I got a happy home
Ever since my first day it's heaven sent now I know
What it's meant when I say
I appreciate what you've done and what you do your only son...
Guess who???
The only one that cares for real and really understands how I feel
Help me over come my fears and never left me through the years
So I dedicate this song for you, for all that you brought me through
I know there will never be another that will love me like my Mother",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-guess-who-lyrics
Sesame Street,Soul Food,1995.0,"Intro:
1995

Sometimes words are enough to kill over
Thanksgiving didn't give, so what should I hope for?
I keep on looking for job but job seems not to like me
What else? My door's kick off the hinges
Somebody just filled they Christmas list off me and the family
And damn, I just missed them
Felt like I've been raped, a finger's been through my drawers
Always read the clause in between the black
Spent my summers in the country, so I consider myself a Jack
Some left this world by putting bullets in they head
But little Johnnie across the street hung hisself from his bunk-bed
Had to go to court in the mornin'
Nothing hard about it
My little partner was just scared
How scared, Gipp? That scared
Sesame Street

When I was BG, used to think I couldn't be hit
None of my homies carried guns, all I had was a stick
Coming out hard was the way from day one
One of the smallest muthafuckers in the crew
But you knew and feel the type of niggas that kill
Be the ones that's out to prove something
To them older niggas 'cause they already know the outcome
What's going down at the party?
So many fine hoes nobody knows why we buck
I guess we up in a rut looking for butt at the same time
Up in the Flame supporting girls up in the game
Out to get a piece of what the system has designed black folks to struggle for
So I bust, so much to deal with
Can't feel what's real from fake
For my sake I stay close to home, so them crackers don't take
And never give back to my hood
In desperate need of change
To this way, so we arrange it to fit me
Growing up on Sesame Street

Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
What chu know? (What chu know?)
What chu know? (What chu know?)
Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
What chu know? (What chu know?)
What chu know? (What chu know?)
About Sesame Street?

Georgia Power wants to put me in the dark
But one spark, I see Sammy streak to my spot
In the red Fred Sanford truck
Undercover but he geela folks for da class ""A"" sub-
Stance narcotic, South stopping at ""shock-a-locka""
I'm too mad to be scared
So for the price if you go it like that
To be the boss, you gladly pay it
An arm and a leg, I'd be lying if I said
I ain't need no help, can't do it by myself
Raining sesame, 'cause it's only so much time left
In this crazy world, mates in prison, guards life with a hammer
So, excuse my grammar
Behind the walls of Atlanta Federal Pen
The jail on Fred Stock, the cell blocks wit more C.O.'s
Equipped with radios
The system is fraud and the security cameras
Now have we an eyeball on it yet
The second stage is denied
I wonder if I get another trial

Remember me from way back in the days?
Lived right around the corner from Benjamin Mays
I'm amazed that we made it this far
A poor black family is all that we are
Wishing upon a star for a trace of happiness
My mama do her best but she ain't making no progress
Maybe it's a test that we all gotta pass
My situations making me grow too fast
13-and-a-half years old
Standing at the bus stop alone in the cold
On my way to be degraded for a fee
To help get my family off this street called Sesame

Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?
Can you see, what I see?
When my feet hit the streets
So what chu know? (What chu know?)
What chu know? (What chu know?)
Can you feel, what I feel?
Can you hear, what I hear?

A nigga trying to be white is what a nigga seem like have become

Dividing and conquering
When they say the lighter shade of black is okay

Should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'

Don't want nobody to have what he ain't got

To offer me some wisdom from this notebook she read
And it said that right then the black man's downfall
Was not know that we were not ever niggers at all, hmm
And she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
You complain about being black
When they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
So many black men out here trying to be niggers
Keeping it real to the point that they dying to be niggers
When in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigga because you black
You a nigga cause of how you act

Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high (Sky high)

Whenever we endeavor, we capture compassion collage
Cleverly they'll never be
Binding for finding that forever free
Naturally, actually, I master me classically
The raspy raps touch the trees and traps
And, oh, believe me, shorty snaps when his lungs collapse
My aunt is scratchin' for the scraps
Wanna love you but I can't, 'cause you eatin' and I ain't
The sinner, the saint
Sky high (Repeat 10X)

Now who done stepped in?
The nigga the B-I-G, the secret weapon, boy
Slicker that black ice, throwing these flows like rice at weddings
So quick flexing, you speaking about somethin' that's refreshing
To the earlobes; pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg, Chryslers and Buicks
Some niggas ain't on their jobs, so them suckers seem to lose it
Abuse their privileges and now their whole village's been shot to pieces
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean, that feces
Boy, don't beep me if you ain't got no work
I'm strictly about these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy
Search boy, talking about your dough is long like Lurch, boy
Every time I heard you rhyming like a fucking jerk boy, simp
Yeah!

Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me you eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
Ain't a thing could explain but what pertains
To cocaine and sustaining reign
See summer rolls around, niggas all about change
Then they steady move them keys like Bob James
'Cause old man winter's arrived, the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone
Making it our own, taking me all wrong
We've all indulged in a bulge of those no-nos
No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people put 'em in a land of snow

Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high

Yeah
If it don't bump off in the club, it don't hit
If you can't get down with D Wayne, we got crip
Never liked short cars in my life, I drove ships
Been gone for three years but we back like crimps
For them boys with the deep dish dicks
White walls thick, didn't have to change much
Didn't have to fix shit, so
Man, make the mothafucka speaker blow, shake the fuckin' flo'
Here to let your ass know
One more time on the grind, didn't have to think twice
When I'm in the streets, always lookin' out for the black ice
Always lookin' out for the black ice

Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high
Touch what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun sky high, sky high",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-black-ice-goodie-mob-version-lyrics
Gutta Butta,Still Standing,1998,"Yo, we gon do it like this
Straight out the parts. . . that they disregard
Never considered . . . ok
Now don't get mad, nigga get glad
Goodie got them brand new trash bags . . dag
And they know where to dump that ass
In the Cha-tahoochie
River with the rest of the kids
That did business outside la familias
Gettin ya touched
Diamond cut
Blunts roastin whole through tea bags
Blowin bubbles out the wrong end
Mud in your stool piles
Flamin hotter than Death Valley
The gateway to where ever your sick tickle desire
The gangsters of this other century
Transforming hustlers and players into sissies
So slim goodie
You don't want no drug boy
He'll leave you barefooted and pregnant
Don't get too comfortable
You ain't gon be here too long
G's get locked up and die (clean)
Most lie in they own cell home
Trust the tree on the map
This one individual thought he was the Grim Reaper
Swore, couldn't nobody put a finger on his naps
Now he up under the bridge stankin
In his birthday suit
Used to always holler about how he was gon do a brother (get him!)
Beat him to the punch-line, one time
Being forced into early retirement at the age of 26
Palms feel like bricks - peeling from distributing crack
Crumb snatchers and goo-gobblers struggle
To stay on top of sand dunes
Some mouths born with silver spoons
Make your bed you gotta sleep in it
Mistakes made
Baking soda kept the neats clean
Narrow like a ravine
Digits fell good news
Last hole, green jacket worn, body in two
Left by oh-no
Soul been gone, disappeared like the dude
Once the temperature rise
But I'm with my Lawd (lord)
Please bricks, still ship
Half the pipes are gettin sold out convienience stores
Where ya at now?
Comming around trying to sniff out sounds
Well rounded kept you strictly grounded for your ear
The dogs are gettin closer to the coons now can you hear?
I smell fear and even if your eyes was closed
Your ass couldn't catch your tear
Lies, straws, mirrors and plates
Nicks, dimes, fifties, and cakes
Why can't I escape
These lies, straw, mirrors and plates?
In the land of jacks I got my axe over the tracks with stacks
Upon the map in the vault
Where this cat's trying to sniff me out
I'm in the southwest woods working all about
Paper capers, never hurtin brothers to obtain
If I can't refrain cause some of these niggas snortin cain
And really don't know which way to go
Confused, you'll abuse anybody for a fix
Hits go for ten bucks, go for 20 and they good and plenty
Fat baggies like ?Maggies? muffin
Where the kid do the stuffin
Silly of these young niggas watching me
As I turn figures into solitare
Twirl up my hair (down south)
Pray to God I don't have to do him
Like I never knew or had no clue to who you was
Cuz, face to face with a scar engraved upon his left cheek
So to speak, I'm more like a icon when it was done to approach my mosse
Be on that Rossie like The Click
So I stay ready for combat and watch the rich get rich off it
Chorus
Nigga I ain't shit, I just know how to rhyme a little bit
Nigga please, I'm still trying to squeeze my fat ass in where I fit
Now I got a little dough, but it ain't that much mo
Than any other nigga I know
We all still poor
I don't sell dope (what you doin?)
I sell hope
You wanna size me up my nigga then wear a scope
Cause you gon see me on MLK and on T.V
I ain't got no fear, my nigga I was born & raised right here
Late one night I was in a pearl white Acura Legendary
I got that thang with me cause it's necessary
Shit, I was just ridin
Wasn't even thinking'bout collidin
But I kept seeing the same headlights running stop signs and red lights
I'd done prepared myself to die if it's my time to go
He said ""you know what it is, you done seen it before""
This sad, of course I'mma be mad
Well here you can have it got damnit if you want it that bad
You would try to take from me, my nigga I ain't no star
I value both of our lives more than this car
You lucky nigga, I used to be you
Shit and I'd bust a hole in your chest somebody could see through
Now remember, shit, you could've died tonight
And I would've been in the right
I ain't even pissed you could just drop me off at the house
Cause I ain't ready to die about nothin like this
He-he-he-he-he-he
Everythang cool my nigga, you could just drop me off at the house

I Refuse Limitation,Still Standing,1998,"Backbone:
One time
Uh for these freaky hoes I lust
But I'm still flickin ashes a lot of other motherfuckers snort dust
But that's they thang
A lot of us fall victim somehow
But that's that game
Won't try to explain
From books to bricks
Now I see crooks and tricks
Caught up in the mix
Of everyday in every way but the right
I control the substance my people fiend for at night
Lord knows I do wrong
Sound like the same old song
A lot of niggas singing
Homeboys conceal your weapons
Cuz ain't gon be no smoking section in heaven
No more be buckin your luck
Seven eleven on the first roll
Don't let the streets rock and roll your soul
Swats GA by way of Cascade Heights
Gunshots roadblocks sidewalks and ice
Khujo:
Sold me out for 3.5 grams of neighborhood clout
Now what the fuss be 'bout
I'm back home from the bullshit
Puttin in work
Meanwhile others dug ditches and covered themselves in dirt
One squirt
And you locked down forever
Can't run from reality
Luring you closer and closer away
To the same old traps
Now you never learn from your mistakes
So now you wear this ass whoopin with pride
What side you on?
It wasn't no I in team
Only in your dreams
Saturated with schemes
Yea you right, God gon deal wit ya
Fallin from his grace
Rookie cop moves cause shifty game
And 30 days I'm blessed in the hole
But that's till I go to the state federal
Penitentiary
Yea I could did my time standin on one feet
But see I fucked up royally
Thought I was slick
Them herpes-havin ass crackers changed my big check to six
Times wit Dean Whitaker's sermon of the day
But when I go to sleep I don't dream no more I just lay
A wise man knows his limitations
Concrete, concrete like Greg Street
Chorus:
Sufferin from a severe case of inner-city blues
I ain't got no clues to which directions I need to choose
This opportunity to gain is all I got to lose
Cuz I just can't settle for these streets shorty I refuse
Gipp:
That's the shit I like
Lord got the door
Shot down to the pavement
Remove yo hat under the ceiling
Of this building
A rebuff from the usher of sorts
Deacons leading hymns rooted stems
Most strive for the diamonds and overlook the gems
Got skimp wit yo bags
Boulders become shoulders to depend on
Which way to explore
Reform, refrain, we gain inflame
Every thought you walk through the trails is hell
Airborne for one
Clone me
Replace me wit me
Another nation inside a nation
Out the land of Scots
Suction cups to test tube
Layer of skin
Supply the crust
And we'll mix the fruit
Gunshows supplied me in the hour of need
Watch em bleed
Aryan Nation be the dealer
Now who's the killer
Yup yup that's the shit I like
That's the shit I like
T-Mo:
Uh puttin forth the effort to make a change
Not doin a lot of talkin bout it what's yo game?
You slippin you can't never do that
That's when you get jacked
For yo life over your emotions runnin wild
Like salamanders swimmin in southwest creeks
Feelin incomplete
Another story
Livin in glory  you had it
Now you lost - it wasn't worth it look what it costed
Yo life young nigga
Didn't go out without a fight behind the gun trigger
Better think fast or get swept off yo feet
Nigga it hurts to see these drugs deteriorate
The minds of knuckleheads that grow up to be base heads
Don't say I didn't tell you cuz you gon see in the future
I hope I don't have to shoot you
If you switch
Went from hardcore to beggin like a bitch
Revolutions good to bad
Hoods to rags real niggas to fags
What's the news?
But I refuse to lose
Chorus
Cee-Lo:
Well I woke up this mornin with the same frustration from situations like these
Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please
Of course I can slice some OZs
But see I'm one of those aspirin MCs
And uh bills are due so at times I'm doubtful and everyone disagrees
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees
These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities
So I quit cuz I'm tired of being one of those overworked
Underpaid employees
Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm gonna get my money even though it's freezin cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, there's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eating away at they souls like disease
A
nyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities
And now my woman's gotta take on a man's responsibilities",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-i-refuse-limitation-lyrics
Still Standing,Still Standing,1998.0,"This for the soldiers (soldiers)
Stay strong my niggas
(gangsters, players)
Stay up my niggas (real niggas)

Leavin the cut in a rage
Loadin up my Mac, goin to my crib, to get my 12 gauge
One of my boys just got shot, huh
Fuckin around, in that million dollar spot
A educated brother
Didn't have no money for college he was taught the street knowledge
Part of the plan
To keep us fightin in the street instead of becomin a strong black man
Every two weeks I see Sam
Pitchin out my check with no respect but I still don't give a damn
Becaause I GOTTA make my dough
My kill, rocked down, til I started seein cash flow
Everything happens for a reason, choose the season
To commit the perfect treason
Who brought me -- to the land, of unfree man
To move about and catch trout, by the dozens
Even had my cousin locked down, at the feet shackled
A one-way seat, to 
Milledgeville
Nigga this real, how can you kill another
When it's your brother? Still Standing

I never thought about, talked about what I did
Just experimented life as a young Gump
Them days long gone, school bells done rung no mo'
Spendin hours at the house in my favorite chair
Slow mo', custom funk fingerprinted to carry a hucklebuck
Feelin stuck with the art that my skin carries, scary
If I ever had to plot again, needin my stick
?Gidgets to pidgits, moves to Philly and the crew?
Nothin else to prove, fold a plot like chrome
Salt lick teddy bears in the college student's room
Speed, Gipp got that too
Watch that dude, inspect that fool, Still Standing

Unscathed, cause this is pain
This for soldiers to feel
MC's, are running out of things to say
Radio stations are running out of songs to play
Still Standing, unscathed, cause of pain
This for soldiers to feel
MC's, are running out of things to say
Radio stations are running out of songs to play

On the sick side, of South Central
33rd Avenue, block 600
Workers have wash and car details
The ese's got the fresh Chevrolet's for sale
Twenty G's or better, the whole neighborhood tanked up
What? On the fortress walls, there is no letters
Buddha say, the Bloods are strictly outnumbered
They beseiged, on the beats, Goodie Mo-B, run the creeps
Y'all can have the streets, asphault caught many suckers
Slippin on wet floors, we puttin out the signs
On krokers, C-I, T-Y, such a pity
Bein suckled dry, like a newborn
On his momma's titty before I retired I hit twenty
True to cellulite with big ?room pesquite? on the porch
Poundin, like cartoon Ennis, old school efforts
Through the Sunday down, Crenshaw sparkin
Zoned out, off the ink, for life
Goin through time and metal detectors, I can't take my weapon
And I can't be no dope dealer
Cause they be done put a hit out on a nigga, plus I can't keep up
With them keys, locked in the fo'-do'
Backseat drivers havin out-of-body experiences
Wakin up, somewhere else... Still Standing

Yeah..
Each and every element that exists in this
Universe is manifested from a thought first
Through the inner mind's eye of the unseen power in the sky
Gave birth to Mother Earth and all it's worth to you and I
This most loved invention, my conciousness is an extension
Of Him, yet I'm flesh and bone with a mind of my own
To dig deeper than the surface, whether I learn
From your upcomings or your downfalls we all have individual purpose
It's amazing, how the streets do the majority of raising
Of children who end up dead before hearing what you said
And it's sad, so all I can write about is what I had
Interpretations of life good and bad with a pen and pad
It seems like abortion, when I just write a small portion
It's either crumpled up or torn without lettin the thought be born
Young minded, and blinded in those days; I didn't want to
Have a thought that I couldn't raise, nurture, and care for
Be there for, help prepare for, the times ahead
When someone doesn't agree with what is said, huh
And if they did, don't get all arrogant cause that's my kid
Just be thankful that it's good and somebody overstood
Now, the listener in here want the same flow but I gotta let it grow
Clever enough to let it go, if I don't wanna rap no mo'
And I'll make sure that no one ever forgets
It's immortalized forever, on wax CD's and casettes
And when someone goes to the store and purchases it for ten
The life cycle starts all over again
And I was granted this music as my soulmate, to procreate
And give back what I was given, a life worth livin
And I, am Still Standing, unscathed
Pain is for suckers to feel
MC's are running out of things to say, and
Radio stations running out of songs to play, shit!
We Still Standing, unscathed
And pain is for suckers to feel, huh
And MC's running out of things to say...",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-still-standing-lyrics
I Didn’t Ask to Come,Soul Food,1995.0,"Everyday somebody gets killed
What's the deal it's 1995
And a nigga wanna live the type of life that people dream
I want things, a crib, a car, while living the life of a king
I know I take for granted at times for what I got
Still hustlin' and bustlin'
And now and then I stand a 
pop
 or two to come up
A steady battle through the days
Mamma think I'm wrong because I wanna get paid
The system ain't given T-mo a chance
22 on the loose and black
Trying to get the noose a little slack around my neck
They making it hard for a brother to cope
It's still illegal to smoke cess cause they can't tax
I'm ready to go up shit until they give my freedom back

Service to what, who
Damn, you got caught sought away out
The trait is getting full, calling up your pull
But pull ain't got it
I fell cold inside like
A man sleeping on pavement
Under the bridge of I-20 west
And stress on the face of the man
Cussing out the atmosphere with nobody close enough to hear
And who dat miss they fee
Cuz all they personal shit
Is sitting on the front lawn of Apple Tree
And for those who ain't got take
Before the owner shows back up with the U-haul
Police you call
But wasn't no marshall there to watch your stuff
See I stand tall to this world
Like a kid walking rapping his rhymes to himself
A book on a shelf of many
MC's seen them come and go
Style free with Cool Breeze
Til it's thick like dat fog
Stacking away my extra for a engine for tha hog
Dropping a point from the East
]From a location out tha trees
360 degrees

Born into these crooked ways
I never even ask to come so now
I'm living in the days
I struggle and fight to stay alive
Hoping that one day I'd earn the chance to die
Pallbearer to this one, pallbearer to that one
Can't seem to get a grip cause, my palms is sweatin' ...

Niggas ain't getting no where fast but, closer to the hearse
Why sunbeam burst off baskets nearly blinding me
Almost dropped ma end of the casket
Woodgrain and the only thang on my brain
Is where this coward hang
(SWATS) South West Atlanta Fountain Lane
Forgot the batch niggah got thirty years
Lord forgive me and my foes I know
Revenge is best served when cold by those
Who feel no guilt
God don't care whether you got a spade or not
Ain't no turning in your playing hand you was dealt
Better tighten up your belt man, always go with
The first instinct because, I don't make the rules
Oooh, you know how it is in these streets
Victims rarely get a chance to think twice

As he laid in the final resting place
He had such a peaceful expression in his face
My visions blurry from crying
But it ain't hard to see that
At any time it coulda been me
It's about 90 degrees outside
But yet it felt like I'm froze
The ceremonies come to a close
I toss a rose but just can't seem to walk away yet
Damn I done fucked around and got upset
But it ain't nothing we can do
It's bigger than me and you
One day our time coming too
So ain't no use in being sad
Leaving here was probably the best gift he ever had
We should be glad
Maybe his life was something
That he had to give to show me
That I need to be responsible about how I live
I won't complain about my pain
But I just ain't gone let my niggas die in vain
So Bean I'm gone make it for you
The cycle that these young black men keep goin through
I'm gone break it for you
And start takin care of me
And me consist of all my friends and my family
From now on, until I'm gone
Born into these crooked ways
I never even ask to come so now
I'm living in the days

In the Woods, where niggas got bounties hangin over they heads
We done went back down the street
And stayed from the concrete treads

Let's hit the damm, where all the beavers go chill
If you trill you betta not squeal
Cause if you squeal, you will disappear
Now that's for trill

Ay, ay, I used to kick the back do' down with the chrome
Now when they see me, you oughta hear em, it's like the leash still on
(FREEZE!) 
I hit the stage, grab the mic, they gets crunk when I speak
Get my money, then I'm out, back at the Embassy Suites
I got some cut with a switch you can't do nothin but admit
I'm East Pointe's greatest hit, she all on my stick
On the strength she be steamin, she come through for any reason
She work at the Parisian, and this is Polo season
Bam, with them Calhouns, high-tops for my feet
Outfit ain't missin nuttin like Brandy, peep
That's how us Headland hustlers ball
Next stop gonna be Greenbriar Mall

Let's hit the damm, where all the beavers go chill
If you trill you betta not squeal
Cause if you squeal, you will disappear
Now that's for trill

Stay in the streets like a Herby Curby
Some that didn't make it through the rain wasn't worthy
96 stamp dirty, flip wide wheels, watch for oil spills
What it is, what it ain't, in the paint, some slow by the dank
I think, make you go blank, lookin for work
Left you where you started shinin shins, under them skirts
At the airport, Gipp cruise the hood
Like a snake up in the woods lookin for a cut party

Let's hit the damm, where all the beavers go chill
If you trill you betta not squeal
Cause if you squeal, you will disappear
Now that's for trill

You know we don't use the Goodie name to pack they function
At the last minute, request for, guest appearances, denied
Time is money, on the wood, many bed no good
Ain't nothin here for you freak, off-brand frapp, really need to learn
How to pick up an Alexander Graham Bell, for she get gripped
Get some nights on beaver, made her way through the damm
Down stream, two crabs, a set of twins, three fins
One main pain was for soldiers to feel
Warriors don't take orders, ain't no serial killers in Georgia
The culprit is blue words in pink skin, so listen our daughters
Daddy's little girl, dialling 1-800-Earl
Cause she want to do what men do

Let's hit the damm, where all the beavers go chill
If you trill you betta not squeal
Cause if you squeal, you will disappear
Now that's for trill

How I wish, you was the last fish, I would have to catch
It was a mess, how the last one, jumped back in the sea
Of Goddesses, from the SWAT it is
A poor playa with skills to build nations of people
Not giving a fuck bout no color, we all brothers that ball
While others get manipulated and fall
Nose wide open to that beast, like it was yo' first
To cash in your V-club, is it really love
That you feel for her, you a betta man than me
To think I can't keep a girl that I like around me
And so there's many that await, stay after plate
My stomach full after I take a pull

Yeah, uh-huh, many gon' come, many gon' go
Some thinkin, I'mma overwhelm, fuck the foes
Some wanna little time, wanna conversate
Some too impatient to wait so we can fully relate
Some Bouvier, and you bout fall clean through thin ice tryin to skate
Your girl and I all playin the game, y'all just don't play the same
Don't give a fuck and brush up off me, tick, tick, shawty Lo be
At a piece of being broken for emotion at F-O-E's
So she know it's gon' be a strike three
But you gotta strike two, huh
But at the damn I could find another just like you
At The Damm I could find another just like you
Huh, goodnight Boo

Sire. What is thy problem?
Boredom besets me like a pack of hounds on a bloody fox
What shall I do?
Fetch me the fool. He makes me feel better
Send for the royal fool (x3)
(And later on…)
Where’s the royal fool?
I have a message from the royal fool
Read it aloud
But, but Sire…
Read it aloud now!
You fucking fool!

The Day After,Soul Food,1995.0,"I'm so happy we made it
I knew one day we would
All these years of strugglin'
Were never understood
Now my eyes are open and I can clearly see
We didn't die for nothin' cuz we're finally free
I'm so happy
My Grand be gone after a 103 years of blood sweat and pain
And never complained
The last words that the nurse heard was the song she sang
Died tired of this living thing
Most I knew never made it to drinking age
Sometimes I fight Gipp
Should I spend or should I hold on for what tomorrow brings
Fly ain't that roll egg, so many lips in my head
Seeing some act up from one tste out the cup
Can't build me up to cut me down
Gipp is in your game, but Gipp won't play your game
In the day after...
I been this way since birth
Heaven upon sent a newborn to tell it like he see it
No lies thru the eyes of an angel suggest you don't table
Every angle be obtuse, ain't no truce, it's war
It won't stop, to compromise wouldn't stop the bloodsheddin'
It's Armageddon in the streets of each inner city
Ain't takin' no pity on this unjust callin' it trust
I'm on the bus starin' out of a window
Thankin' 'bout them happy days I had
Over the summer growin' up fast to face life and harsh realities
That come wit the territody didn't know when I was young
So many get hung to hang
Take away the bad and bring back
The good that die mostly over bullshit
Takin' a gun and pulled it on an innocent friend of mine
That could have been yours
How can I stop the war and all the crime inside the minds that's
Programmed to destroy
From the beginning when will it end...
On the day after judgement will I be ready
I'm so happy we made it
I knew one day we would
All these years of strugglin'
Were never understood
Now my eyes are open and I can clearly see
We didn't die for nothin' cuz we're finally free
I'm so happy
Meant I'd be spoiled rotten
A fin here a fin there but receipts please
For my feet I need... a new pair of hi rollin'
But the car ain't stolen
Pistol still smokin' from herndon homin' in on somebody
Gotta pay for restitution with heavily on my mind
Free fom mental debris hose me down
There my physical trame lay returnin' to its rightful place
A quest for forgiveness answer...
The death toll talley but my soul was spared
How is your prepared medium rare if you dare disobey
Well done race you the last one to orion star
Smellin' like shit in a glass jar
The bomb light years away from earth secure a space for my family
The mother of my first conceived and all the weak relatives
I hurt only...when I laugh
On display afta judge none careless atmosphere
Opportunity knockin' answer it knewin you would
Good thangs come to those dat wait...
Took a los on church strait
The nifty fifth whut better place
Fo' mo enenmy to hide than behind religion
Done gee seen on I pray for you but I won't follow you to yo end
I know of a place not too far away
That maybe you and I can both go someday
But I gotta make sure cause I ain't tryin' to stay here
Don't y'all realize that the end is so near
But don't have fear cause you still got time
I hope you wanna come when I'm done with the rhyme
Let me explain so you won't claim you didn't know
And you can make sure that this is where you wanna go
It's all about preparing yourself for the return
And a trip to your soul is the only way you'll learn
But if you choose not to go that ain't my concern
I guess in hell you'll just have to burn
The devil tell lies and try to trick yo soul to receive it
They tell you that my Lord ain't coming' back and you believe it
Regardless if you listen to me
In the end we'll see...
I'm so happy we made it
I knew one day we would
All these years of strugglin'
Were never understood
Now my eyes are open and I can clearly see
We didn't die for nothin' cuz we're finally free
I'm so happy",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-the-day-after-lyrics
Is That You God,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Mmmmmm.... mmmmm...
Ain't it somethin' awwww
How I ain't nothin' ah-awe
And how sore oooh ooooh oooh
It comes from sufferin' ah-awe
Something is alive in me
Something keeps drivin' me
And it keeps right on
Surprising me awwww
And I tell em'

Well it ain't me
And I can't see
Is that you God?
And I can't see
And it sure ain't me
It must be God

God, I got something to tell you...
I think about when I lost half of my leg
I think about the quake that left 40 thousand dead
I think about the troops coming home from the east
I think about taking a mark and worshiping the beast
I think about revelations 19 & 20
Isaiah 18 and Jeremiah 50
I think about me, my momma and my brother
How we grew up on chapel road and had to struggle
I think about all the victims of the hurricane
I think about all the homeless folk, when it rains
I 
think about when we came over here as slaves
And when it's time to leave, who gon' wanna stay?

Well it ain't me
And I can't see
Is that you God?
And I can't see
And it sure ain't me
It must be God

Sometimes I don't make the right choice
You know my momma say she hear it in my voice
I'm just a brotha with a plan and a purpose
So my hands get sweaty when I'm nervous
Got some good people standing in my circle
Family matters got some folk that'll hurt ya'
Or maybe even help ya'
Just show love for the bro's cause the blood be shelter
And it came with a sacrifice
At a time when the people of the world wasn't living right
Now it's even worse than it ever was
When I see my kids I'mma get a hug

Well it ain't me
And I can't see
Is that you God?
And I can't see
And it sure ain't me
It must be God

Is that you God? (I hope so)
Now listen
It's morning and the prodigal son is shinin'
I yawn and stretch and get dressed for some mountain climbin'
I wear it well but this is not by my designin'
The inevitable has impeccable timin'
And if you left it up to me I'd say never
Only God could've brought us back together
And all I say is I obey
You see, the family tree is tatted on my back forever
Uh, and I feel purpose
The salvation army is at your service
Act like you heard it
Cause uh, our only challenge is balance
But I believe that the will of God is perfect
Now let's go

Well it ain't me
And I can't see
Is that you God?
And I can't see
And it sure ain't me
It must be God

Look at the way he dress, look at the way he talk
My whole attitude is mine and they snow ball
Gipp my right to scripture, hope you get the picture
It gives me the answers, to my different issues
Life is pain
We can conversate and bring the light over and over
The bills keep comin' right?
The devil's gon' test ya'
But really no pressure
Just believe have faith, and he'll direct ya'
Diamonds and dollar signs they on my red slippers
Money maker in my time happy hour tipper
Synchronize my rhymes just to help the crime rate
Hope my words change your life
Help my people say

Well it ain't me
And I can't see
Is that you God?
And I can't see
And it sure ain't me

Blood,Soul Food,1996.0,"Lock the doors !

It's a shame, when niggas gon' realise we're the same
Helpin' the enemy win the game
If you a player, use precision, don't make a decision in haste
Blood is a terrible thing to waste

In my flip-flops and socks, I walk blocks confused
Cos my nose ain't right, my sight blind
Smoke, need somethin from my toke
More than half my folk vying for the juice of cooked goose
In the city of disgust, nuttin new blew in
But almost left your bed, yet I said
My mind back home, I roam the path in the trees
I give my ankles in the mud for my blood, what happened was
Something for the ill-minded, even though you're true
Your feet can't fit in my shoes, I got red in my eyes
My old man still don't understand why
The things I do, the way I think
A hot spell and death feel, got the chokers for the low-low's
Specialisin in the greenery
Code name: Cardwell, so what's real?
I still float the sidewalks of Adamsville
Consume smoke with my folks on the low-lean
Blew Dixie Hill to get a little more pote'
And if ya can't find none of the Goodie in the veins
Of the ATL, try the wood or the trail

I try to make sense outta nonsense each and every day
I got to cos things is kinda crazy round the way
Each word that I say may cut you like a knife
And totally influence and change somebody life
Who me? I'm 19, and best to have seen
What I already seen
Life taught me a lot
That you ain't gotta carry no gun to get shot
Ain't gotta be no jacker for offense from the high
A liquor store on every corner that you walk by
I watch my niggas die for no reasons
In my neighbourhood ain't nothin changed but the seasons
Them crackers don't give a fuck, then again why should they
They evil from their head to they toes so how could they
You could say, the biggest problem in the black community is lack of unity
I love you but I ain't gon' let you pray for me
So if you must shed blood so be it
The end is comin' I can see it
Yeah, the end is comin' I can see it
It's in the blood

Me look at myself and say ""Damn!""
I use to rock Cascade at night and East bound
But now I sit back and take a pull
Take out my pin, I'm ready to get a beer, wet, I might 
I'm ready to pay my dues, fool
Why choose to trump me, I never did shit but you label me the OutKast
So even if I was to blast on your punk ass
It wouldn't change my opinion of a customer
That I was to serve like a bird over on the South West side
And this side better be rollin' thick
It's that G-double O-D-I-E M-O-B to infinity ballin'
Huh, and callin' da wild, cos I don't smile
I keep a grim look and bust a *?poor 6-0 cars?*
Out in their yard without a strap ain't cool
You just a son of your daddy and momma without a tool, fool
No time for weep, incomplete, my story ain't told to glorify no glory
I lost my sister age nine doin' a crime for a hustle
So she died lookin' for that muscle
You wonder why I acts how I do, quiet-type
So I might strike any minute, fool
Step into Zone 3, see
South West Atlanta up in this motherfucker deep
Don't sleep, you all, in my cabin braggin'
But I can't hear or see see clear
Cos we all on the outside, we're pimpin' or homicide
Already so many resting in peace but I can't sleep til I can believe
I'm ready to die for my cause
I'm Good cos I'm true to my blood

I'll blast for my family, don't be mad at me
Was it because I didn't finish C-O-double L-E-G-E?
There's only a punk ass army down while you're harassin' me
Stop takin' me thru episode after episode
The reason why I leave my humble abode is to keep from punching holes
In the wall, I had dreams I played ball
Wit the pros, I pop punts and field goals
Droppin' them fat guv's in the weight room
Had, so nigga on swole but that was in the days of the old strole
Now I'm wisin' up to the fuck shit, got a new click to run with
Bays a left at Campbelltown Plaza, *?Foo-ti and C's?* and ol' South
Oh yeah, I borrow rollerscott tissue when it's sun, and paper
Completes my grocery list, proceded to my ol' bird
In the kitchen cookin' chitlins
Pre-setting the eggs, the fish, the grits, that hit the spot
But this morning I had to punch the clock
Whether it be sittin' off in the hills of Dixie
Witta pocket full of rocks that icey
Creole, you talkin' to me? Ettering bastard, put it down on paper
I put a thermal couple of two on 'burnt out on capers'
Everytime the rubber buck, it was like plus-fools hit from a potented salt
Scab A-rab, many hoes suckin' on your nuts
That's why I'm stealin' your death right now because
Later on you might leave me hangin'
Is it the noose rhyme on people's necks when already tangin'
Tight, from the dank is dye, and now, banger who am I
To tell you to stop, but don't be bringin' that nonsense
In these hills, brass bop Benz in my grill
All the way, Confederate man you thought it was raw but
You ladies are real ready, it's janky
On edge, it's in the kill
The beast in you divided who? Me from him?
You gotta chance but it's slim, it's slim
Just walked out the door but yet and still
You want some ole 9-7-6 gab, slab by slab
Broke my community down to its knees
Deep burgundy, hemorrhage and internally
B-L-O-O-D
Hmm, yeah, uhh",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-blood-lyrics
The Coming,Soul Food,1995.0,"As I begin fall in, I spark the riot, no longer quiet
I got a voice that's in ya ear, stand clear
It's madness everywhere I look
But can't see, so much I can't explain how I feel on the real
Every day is like a ferris, looking to find some wheels
Homey after homey dying over humbug
Keeping my mind immune to pain
I'm going insane just thinking about the past
At last it's a future I can see much more that I got older
So I know how the game goes telling me like I can't cope
It's the dope you smoke
That's why you looking at me ready to jack
'Cause that crack got your back broke
Have to learn the hard way out the hood
Thank it's real when it's flaw
I saw this nigga get shot in front of my school, it wasn't cool
That gangsta shit affects not poppin' off just da 'jects
360 degrees all due with respect

It's the comin' of the killin' tool click...
Atlanta got a killin' tool, watch me rule, bitch
Killin' tool click
Watch the killin' tool, watch the killin' tool click

Waa-taaah, tha angelical Ninja when you blink
You'll need a shrink, how the fuck did you think
That I could be sniped nigga
See, you fuckin' right I'mma try to kill ya, straight drill ya
I take my fuckin' life serious
You attack my self-defense is war, period
I know niggas all over the SWATS
Niggas that'll get in yo' ass on the spot
Concoct like a wise wizard
Just 'cause I wear the red eye, you may think I'm a high nigga
But looks could be deceiving
God lives within me, and brother, I feel him
I speak to God before I take my gat and juice ya
'Cause he the one that's holding my future
See as you learn me, you journey out of time
'Cause your present state, I gotta take ya out ya mind
Y'all done let the devil tear your perfect world up
Got men sleeping wit men and girls wit girls
Seems all right to you, hey but to me, that's taboo, yes I do
Fuck the dumb shit, I comes wit, drums hit
Some get the hummin' comin from the Witchdoctor's gun in
Killin' tool click
Khujo, come with the killin' tool click

Bill wash my mouth out with soap
Sent you home with yo' shit pokin out
The loft shoutin' out obscenities
No, it's just a dream, but I'm a sore loser
Flag murderer, crosses burnin' in my front yard
KKK throwing them rallies, but no, not no more
In these parts, trespassers gets penalized...
2:13 A.M., basic nine channel surfin'
This one-eyed monster servin' it's purpose
Clampett's biggest hustle, nineteen-ninety-nine
Three dollars plus shippin' 'n' handlin'
Major credit card holders accepted, but I'm a minority
Septic tank on ABC...
Turner Broadcasting niggas already done took over this bitch
System just still runnin'... to be or not to be done in
At the push of a button is the question
I think they got this bitch rigged to blow up in my face
Duddy the first African-American to walk in space
Now who you think had the pleasure, of tryin' on they new suit
The nightmare continues, are we just penny gig's

Comin' with the killin' tool click...
Come back to rule, bitch
Comin' like the killin' tool click
Killin' tool click, killin' tool click
Atlanta got a killin' tool click
Come back to rule, bitch
Comin' like the killin' tool click
Tool click, tool click, tool click...(East Point...)

On the concrete is where I make my money at
On this concrete is where I make my living at
On this concrete is where your blood can flow
On this concrete, fool, if I don't get the dough
I'm pumpin' thangs out of suite 116
Got the Arab sewed up, stitched up, buckled up, buckle down, hit the sto'
7-Tre-1 as soon as I exit 166, traffic gettin' stuck, but fuck this
I hit the back streets, ended up coming down Childress
Ain't no space, cut through the Fina, so I park, I hit my usual
I tuck and hold, flip and fold, no life insurance, but I got my Grady card
Depress me, stress me, the same that exploit me
Suppress me, break Cam, run thinkin' of a son trying to see through tha fog
Just to see how far who's coming out the woods?

And I suggest you don't fuck wit us
(Ha ha ha) Cracker. you stuck wit us
And you know how long we been waiting for you
Devil, We know what you been contemplating to do
We have been here before, but surprise again
It is time for niggas to uprise again
But we've been down for so long that you wondering how
It ain't a weapon that you got that can stop me now
Because we don't die (Don't die) We won't die (Won't die)
And it won't get no better if we don't try (Don't try)
But don't get scared, nigga, get prepared
I gotta care 'cause the fuckin' devils never cared
So come and find us (Find us), get behind us (Behind us)
If you ain't hear the message clear, then rewind us (Rewind us)
'Cause we comin'

Come back to rule, bitch
Atlanta got the killin' tool click
Tool click...watch the tool click
Atlanta got a killin' tool click
East Point got the killin' tool click
College Park, killin' tool click

So I'm the major money maker, motherfuck these niggas
Keep yo' eyes on amounts, accounts and some bankers
Get high, get fly, til you get it, gettin by
Don't switch get krunk get drunk get rich

From the bottom to the top now it's hot; keepin it heated
People about to see they chasin after cash in the ass
Suckers crash on the blast from the past
Goodie Mo.B. Backbone and OutKast, whatchu think this was, black?
Take your sorry ass watch me blow, turnin my lyrics in the flow
This is how it go, and it go, perfect picture paintin
Million dollar hold in the Cascade, in the shade

And find dat, and find dat, top top, we get rich to dis, yeah!


The Goodie they call me, they wanted a player to bust to this

People all in my wallet hopin to frolic we gon' see ho
Just hold up; you know my pockets swoll up
I'mma let you suck my dick to meet your quota
And you're fine, kinda shorter
But I made this money before you got a Toyota and Explorer
And when I'm off in the mall gettin fresh, I'm gon' ignore ya
Look at the earrings, the gold chains, the diamonds around my neckpiece
The leather suede snake Elizabeth all up on my left B
Ho look at all these emeralds and these rubies and my gold teeth
Thinkin a nigga spiritual tryin to build but you don't know me
See there's more than meets the ear so we can ball that's if we chose to

Did you catch that word blurred
Talk slow, walk slow
And years passed
Make that cash
Never took a second look
Follow the rules in the book
Watch 'em chill and cook

Same sing-song

Break bread and peace treaty
Across seas ?????
Till the feds get it
And split it
With other federals
And ????? agents and senators and representatives that live off us
And feed off us

Raise against the grain
And I refuse to settle

Delight and entertain
Passionately persistent
When I preach this positivity
For stand up God, write hard things I like to say
And I wasn't gonna take a chance
See if I can make y'all dance
But I really ain't got that much time to play
So just row
Your little boat down the stream
But go slow
Cause life is only a dream
And if I should die before I awake
I leave to all my beloved this message to take
Ahhhhhh

The beneficient
The merciful
Lord of worlds
Master of the days of judgement
Guide me on a path
Upon those whom you bestowed your favors
Not upon those whom your wrath is brought down
Nor upon those that go astray, after hearing your teachings
Confidence shot
Self-esteem low extremely
Contagious flavor
Distributed major
Tomatoes reduce
The chances of prostate cancer
Disease is fictitious
Never abandon your Emmanuel
For want of religion
Kept peasants 180
Just got back
From where
It ain't nothin' but gamblin'
In the pockets scramblin'
To avoid the sack
I'm seldom seen
Cause I'm on the label

Gipp keep it slow poke, hang out the side with no rope
Sit in the tub, flick the remote and soak
Pull up, jump out, and then I strut for her
And if anybody got problems, I'mma cut for her
In this atmosphere now you can disappear, smoke thick shells
Bail like tailbacks looking for holes
Drag my ass down the ave like a cab
Scar that ass, leave your shirt open like an Arab
Making money off these breakdown slabs
We got this zone, get your own
Better move on before your folk get split, you won't forget
The DF put it down, now get down, or sit down

Sunday mornin, makes me feel
So Godly, pardon me, if I shake your soul...
(I got it, I got it shorty... it's our ball, uhh)

I tackle my problems, never run from my foes
Stiff-arm facemask, hit the juke button, then leave a sucka froze
Like he just tried to stuff a whole ki up in his nose
On all fo's
You hit 'em high, I hit 'em low, for this dough
Your heart gon' bust out here, 'cause we comin' full speed
We dig, intend you lift you up off of your feet
At the lift, of the glass, sippin' victory
Clean cut but I stay dirty
Uhh, you play fair, I cheat
I spike this pig in yo' face like you never stopped eatin' pork
Or beast, and diseases end careers
Tenacious on his grill, uhh, All-Pro Hall of Famer
With no fears, blood sweat and tears, uhhh, uhh, ohh shit

Sunday mornin, makes me feel
So Godly, pardon me, if I shake your soul...

The rich boy got it bad 'cause he is rich
The po' boy got it bad 'cause he is po'
The bad boy got it bad 'cause he want growth
The good girl got it good 'cause she got game
And runs it on undeveloped fellas considered lame
Same like mechanics do it, baby who need her Buick
Repaired, don't have no knowledge of what a brake shoe is
Make woo it, turn to nickle, squirm and tickle
We wiggle, now yo' emotions like a dill pickle
In autumn, fall, into the bottom of black holes
Make a left on nothingness 'cause that's where I'm at
Cold as summer, I got yo' number, you got my number
Let's add 'em, see what we come with maybe we can slumber
Like uhh, beggars and bums and uhh, retarded ones, uhh
Dolphins and whales, uhh, the smartest ones, so
Nothing you can do can be new up under the sun
Depending what sun you live under, you can be the one on...

Sunday mornin, makes me feel
So Godly, pardon me, if I shake your soul...

Ain't no Sunday School this mornin
They say somebody blowed up the church
What's even worse than that
I heard Pastor Jenkins he got hurt by the
Perpetrators, demonstrators of violence and hatred
It's fin' to be 2001, the rojo-necks are racist
Fascists acting savage on the Sabbath must be demons
Errand boys for Satan defeated when I repeat it
Rebuke thee, rebuke thee, the look in they eye was spooky
But now I find myself in the park sittin' in my hooptie
Like a movie, I was daydreamin' and everythang seemed real
But now I'm at Mozley Park and we got some chicken on the grill
Get a beer, nigga chill, roll a joint, pop a pill
Cop a feel, or some cut, as we do it like this here on..

On Any Given Sunday, alllll, Atlanta will be born
Ahhhhhh tradition will be broken
Ahhhhhh, victory is yours, on Any Given Sunday

Distant Wilderness,Still Standing,1998,"Why is it you fail, to see a man
In the same hour, that his kin come grinnin?
In another code, fell asleep, party mode, tryin to come up
From the ashes that defy your lift, listen up
Ladies seem sweet, the ocean meets the mountain peaks
Stone-walker, the side-walker, watches loose lips, Wall Street
Numbers set by stock movers, buy my tip so I can touch
Not for no print size, plate saint, white wasted H20
Four coats'll make it glaze
Beams rooted like dogwood, between the Pine, wind
Twenty-fo' stores with malt for sale, still fetchin water
Out the well, help em size, find the grind, find the times
Where the times weighed as hard as ? find me shoes, dead beat daddies
Rico dead, he didn't make the TV
So why should I weep, man gon' bye, see you when my light blow
Got more good than dirt to throw, and I won't pull
Between the halo, and a fork-pitch
Suffocated by my rhymes...

Rest your mind in distant wilderness
Take your time and concentrate on it
Take a stand and make your hand a fist
We got a reason to resist

The mortal originator, don't cross the fader
Chillin in Decatur, where it's greater, secure streets
In the hood late at nights, dippin fine
Hard not to be slippin, if they come, I won't run
When it's time, I ain't trippin, I got my date
And you got yours too, I see, the record sales soar
After the death, of this creator, genocidal, tendencies
When they mention He, who listens to unseen hand
Slapping the faces of the young black man, when they sing
Knowin that we Godly, got to keep it right
With my people cause I'm equal no matter, how much I make
I can't escape fate, the date as I await
As I await, I can't fake
Can't fake, I can't fake, I'm true with it

A duffel for the cash, platinum within myself from another earth
Spill, nina, tea leaf, your very, existance
Is considered a privelege, buck up, and they can't, be revoked
Pay your taxes, uhh, snake eyes
Strapped with flaws, still ignorant to a lot of laws
Man-made, but that's a dot
Everybody from the East coast done went back home, to think
Gettin they thoughts mixed negative, after reoccurances
I say a prayer, plus if I, entertained them
It's easy to commit, hard to resist
And once we cross that line segment, not even our producers
Can bring us back, eyeballs peeled
Eardrums opened, egos stripped stroked
Another low blow delivered to the hip-hop culture, uhh
Industry consists of thieveries, prostitutes
And vultures if somethin bigger than us, past the blue
Told us that it wasn't a heaven for G's
Then we do this, continue your devilish deeds
I mean activities, that just show, that it's a Hell
For Jacks, independent, but you distributed by your masters
Labels still a slave, but you just get to eat at
The white man's table, lookin like Gable Gunther
On the Guinness Book of World Records, God didn't like ugly
And he wasn't too fond of cute either
A climate of caution, a climate of caution in effect
Hard acts to follow


Where ever I am, you can feel God is present
In the midst of darkness if you spark up bet somebody gonna see it
It is necessary for me to speak these words now
Another day here hasn't been promised to me, don't you agree
That you never fail when you try, 
I'm willing to die but first
I am willing to live, and I overstand that this will be
A lifelong sacrifice
, 
in order to reveal
You gon' have to destroy
, 
and if you ain't thinkin right
You damn sure can't act right
,
 somebody raise your fist
And let me know I'm not alone
, 
revolution, doesn't mean fightin
In these streets
, 
and it ain't gonna be no revolution
Without the women
, and, it ain't gonna be no future
Without the children, 
and, it ain't gonna be no children
Without the men
, and, you can't have no love without the trust
And no, 
trust can come without communication
And you can't communicate if you ain't got shit to say
You can't teach about what you, been deceived about too
Any book you read is still limited education
You gon' have to talk to God personally
 
and time is short
And, he's on his way,
 and 
I will receive a great reward for what I've done
And this is all that really matters to me
In time you will see what I told you is true
And I ain't have to rhyme to say that to you
I ain't got to rhyme to say it to you, it's true",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-distant-wilderness-lyrics
What It Ain’t (Ghetto Enuff),World Party,1999.0,"Now TLC will challenge Goodie Mob
To a game of ghetto laser tag
When they say 'What it is'
You scream 'What it ain't'

(Battle zone, Goodie)
1999 (Yeah)
TLC, M-O-B (And Goodie Mob)
The synergy of ghetto sounds for the Y-2-G
(Whatcha wanna do with it?)
What it is, what it ain't
(What?)
Either you bring it
(We gon' bring it)
Or you can't
Sometimes it gets kind of messy out there
(Sometimes)
But we get by
(Well whatcha wanna do with it)
One day at a time

Stuck on me at waffle house
After 1:12, when I go out
Where do you hang?
Or do you slang?
Or wear a chain?
Wear platinum rings?
I still maintain my ghetto side (Yeah)
Keep my pride
Get in my ride
Twenty-inch rims
I sport a brim
Hang with my girls
Go to the mall
Around the world
And keep the change
The finest things
Will still remain so ooh

Don't even look from across the room
You don't know enough about this world to
Ever get it on with me
Or hang out where I do (Ooh)
Don't even look from across the floor
You don't have game enough any more (To)
To come up on a girl like me
And that's not a possibility cause

You a big plastic girl
I'mma big boss man
I like old model cars and big sedans
You like two doors
Frontin' their clothes and Rolls
Or sit on the porch sip something cold
I like the nine when you up and not O's
I do sweets while you prefer the lows
Tonight I'mma choose cause you already chose
Grown for the business and I run the flow

Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me (What?)
And you ain't hot enough for me (Enuff)
And you ain't fly enough for me
And you're too tight wit yo money (Uh)
Cause you ain't ghetto enough for me (What?)
And you ain't hot enough for me
And you ain't fly enough for me
And you're too tight wit yo money

Check it baby
So ghetto like hot fries
I come from Melvin and resemble
Twenty-twenty with his blood shot eyes, got 32 loads
Went from two O's to 32 loads
Which is enough to buy a Rolls
Hey, but nobody knows
Stay at my place
Keep my diamonds out of your face
You wanna be with this player
You gotta play at my pace
I'm slow but I can still come over there from where you're from
If you want some bullshit you better buy you some

(Ooh) Don't even look from across the room
You don't know enough about this world to
Ever get it on with me
Or hang out where I do (Ooh)
Don't even look from across the floor
You don't have game enough any more (To)
Come up on a girl like me
And that's not a possibility cause

Shorty wear yo booty shorts
Shorty wear yo gold teeth
Shorty wear yo long nails
Shorty wear yo fake hair
Shorty got the attitude all up in the news
To represent the Nineties girl
Doing it oh I need to
I got the back you got the fronts
That's how we do up in the woods
With the bump on the log, ain't no scrubs over here
I'mma ghetto millionaire, if you see me in the clear
I'mma keep on serving 'em like I'm supposed to baby

Oh what I'm saying
Stop using the rope take 'em real off these streets
Or you might hurt your throat
You know you ghetto
When you don't show up at court
For not paying your child support
Are you too bougie for me?
You act like you too good to eat
At Church's, Popeye's, and Arby's
I shop at Walter's Bright Creek
In a mall with Steve and Deke
I hang out at Bankhead

Your favorite color is hot pink
I love that gangsta red

Ghetto-ology,Still Standing,1998,"""Uh-huh... Ben Hill been real
Still trill, Southwest
Y'all niggas wanna do somethin' with it?
Y'all niggas wanna do somethin' with it?
Chorus:
Now from that ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
Got one foot in, one foot out...
Of the ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
That's why I know the things I know!
In the ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
And some of my friends done died befo'
In the ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
That's why I can't seem to let go
Chiefton:
How do you feel when you judge quick
And you all up in my face and I ain't even spit?
Just like them folk that say they know me from my old days
I know you wonderin' about my spirit and my old ways!
You hearin' me spittin' the piece of mind, got you froze in time
Playin' catch-up with yourself
I'm on another level, and you can say I'm dead wrong
Even if you stay home
They gotta fight because you livin' in a war zone
Head strong
Can't leave it 'lone till they get and they gone
So now I'm stylin', my momma 'bout to travelin'
He be hangin' with them monsters and they smilin
And my babies' coughin', thinkin' they have TB
And they neva call him daily in that wee-wee
So what I find is to eliminate the problem
Befo' they cause problems
Befo' we have problems
Cause you thought you had it sewed up
Until that green house grew all of a sudden
Sho' nuff, it showed up
Now you didn't know he had it in him
The venom
It fits the test and I'm gon (win) him
Then the ride, can't be cryin' got it steady now
You need to find out, there ain't no time-outs
You can't sign-out, better let it whine out
Don't drop the gun cause the street is gettin' packed now
Just let cones bang the ground, don't you back down!
For it's the fate, that brought you to this place now
So let it guide you and take you to that touch-down
And stay ground, so that you can stay proud
Cause one in, and one quick
CHORUS
T-Mo:
I got these jokers with their eyes red
Drinkin' too much, got dead
I make you shout it if you's in the 'burbs
Herbs beware
It's from the one that data compare
Logistic, chicken biscuit
This Winter, he will forget the cold through a song
And my (party wrong), and my weak is strong
Just kept his back turned, yearned
For destruction bustin' microphones
Blessed the unprotected soul
Lettin' go, call him too much
Will get you off for sure
Watch (???????)

What's gon' save you from the hands of (why)
When them guys gone, and you (bet) home in the ghetto

They trappin' him off within then
Look at the fonky red'ead
Done flipped them all as dead
Paint wet, now I'm set
Fight the shit, watch it hit
Block lot
Neighborhood charcoals
And that old (mark-o?)
After dawn, on the porch

Fashioned like
Niggas sold, new or old
It's gettin' sold in the ghetto
CHORUS
Cee-Lo:
Now from the go child
My name is Lo
God done gave me this vision quite some time ago
He taught me shout it when you (talk chance the blow?)
You preach that real shit 'till you can't doubt no mo'
Now wait a minute y'all, I am the one
That ride the rhythm from midnight to the morning sun
I do it for the freedom, finance, and forever fun
Now revolution of the mind has already begun
Now just a second y'all
It got to be
For every thought is fulfilled in the prophecy
I'm supernatural and there is no stoppin' me
Even the ghetto is still God's property!
C'mon
Khujo:
Ever since you was a youngster the devil been
Over your soul, like this one-eyed monster
Ain't no in between you either off or on
Never pass judgement
But the feeling is mutual
Pass the hog mog, tryin' to drown me
After years of gravel
You promised no rest to (blow) in weeks
I know you ain't choppin' in the next man footprints
Wobblin' like a duck
Stuck, crawlin' out the same hole
Me don't promote no mysterious behavior

It come through in the ghetto!

Check this out, bust it
This is like a rocket, you never packed
This many condominiums in your pocket
Ughn, you never smoked this much weed before
Where else can these niggas go
Don't know tomorrow, it's about today, bruh
I want some coochie that I ain't gotta pay for
I'm the one that holidayed ya
ATL, land where we par-laya
No nigga jealous with his gat wanna clown
It's enough females in the streets to go round two, three times
Atlanta, the doctor's home
Always somebody hoggin the payphone
Say homes, where your daughter
She'll tell ya I'm pure like Artesian water
Feed me a quarter like a jukebox
I sell rhymes like rocks, the police oughta stop checkin
The Lord gave me a blessing
Long as rocks I sees with you
Think the Lord pleased with you
Ughn, you think he kissed you
You think he kissed you
Or he dissed you

Khujo:
Suits of brutality patrol sectors
Day care centers ran by vestors
Drunk drivers behind the steering wheel of liquor trucks
New comers think they won the diversion on pure luck
Shark pools in the hall, one drop can start a frenzy
Feeding off of your ignorance of the law consider no excuse
We here by being careful, vigilence
Vampires ??? lace personal pants with blood
Just ask for the special
Crackers crave samples of niggas urine
Strands of hair and semen
Blue lights in the basements
Having conversations with voices between four by fours
Rack 'em up, I'll bust your head
Stay playing the role of executioner, been years on death row
Now he don't wanna die for arranging his wife's murder
Equal opportunity, designated bullets don't discriminate
Like unemployment, officers doing break
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
One deep in this team
Y'all done stepped on we, the green green
(Poetry runs deep in this team)
Chorus
T-Mo:
Belligerent thoughts of militant ways
Camouflaged in the brush, love or lust
Which can we trust hidden in the cuts
Terr-i-ble they bounce 'em every third month
Yeah, after the big flood of truth
Caught in your own evidence
Now you hesitant to believe me
You back to hangin with Parks
That's what you called her
Now you run cause you know that's what you want
(What you want, what you want)
If I felt like everything was good
Maybe then I could knock on wood
To protect the good
That surrounds my innermost thoughts
Until my thoughts were caught unguarded
As hard as it is to be perfect I try
And I still flaw listening to the next guy
That knew more and saw it before I did
Came up big, to dig an early grave
Get locked up, and turn a slave for the rhythm
We rap, still get slapped by the system

Sit and chill a while, wait a minute yo we blows big nigga
Sip on bottles with funny names, holla holla
Deep in this thang, keep it simple and plain
And watch my chain hang, watch my chain hang

It's about me, and I suggest that to any nigga who doubt me
It will correct you, affect you, it will make shit clear

And Birmingham then back, punk is spittin his jack

Lyric assassin while mashin they blastin come fast and
Scatter from every rational imaginal
International region, under my seeds and, over these airwaves
Manipulate the rhyme with my mind so it's good to grind
Through your speaker, this one's a keeper
Like Ebenezer, it was his decision, to live his life
Through a tunnel vision, followed by the reaper
Who knows your past deeper, don't let him creep ya, from behind

Before I was rudely interrupted, house fallin down
But we straight, you should save yourself ??
It's rainin suckers cause they greed sickens me
Poverty stricken, hand pickin, in the corner cleansin
Lights out poor, slip and you nails hell
Everythang for sale, be eat with they plastic
Let's enhance it, I'll be good til Saturday
Thick volume gravity

We bout to mix and mingle, meet a match for the next single
Money stashed away in jars like Pringles
Keep it hard for the Tunnel, we make it bump
For the 5 5 nina skull-cap boot-wearin renegade motherfuckers
Throw yo' hands up, you give it up we give it back
Yo, this is how we act when it's packed from the back
Lady don't snatch, let my chain hang
Everythang is everythang boo

Behold, the stolen soul, the ancient scroll
The game of control, roll the Swisher swoll
Open the gate away, lay to lay, I getcha gotcha greaterly
Even when you hate me, you educate me
So try to trill, I will take ya to the battlefield
Crack your motherfuckin, windshield you better yield
Cause I got the right of way, night or day, alright okay
This is Carlito's Way
Chorus 2X",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-chain-swang-lyrics
"Git Up, Git Out",UnKnown,UnKnown,"Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try
You need to git up, git out and git something
Cause you and I got to do for you and I

I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around then I can't be found
Always asked to give me some living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit
And I'm probably gon do some mo'
You shouldn't hold that against me though (Why not?)
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be ingested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm goin' say this to you I
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without
And what up with all these questions?
As act as though you know something I don't. Do you have any suggestions?
Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd have resort to drug smuggling
No, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-lo will just continue traveling this route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?

Well, uh, git up, stand up. So what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngsta, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it, but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
In the middle school, I was a bigger fool
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then, I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
See all the players came and all the players went
A player ain't a gangsta but a player can handle his shit bitch
You need to git up, git out, git something
Smoke out, 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plats and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade 'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
And it's cool
Yeah, it's real cool, getting paid fat pockets
And all that other fat shit like that, ha-ha

A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I got my long johns, get my coat and throw on my ball cap
I'm headed out the door, to get off in my ride
I'm digging through the ash tray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
Back up in my crib, eat my shit, break out quick, in my slick
'84 Se-dan DeVille, steady bouncing
Out the Pointe to Cambelton Road
The valley of the Southside flow
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow, so
Keep your eyes peeled for the 'cover unit
Cause they known for jumpinf out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm bustinf out around the corner in my hog
Dippin from the area, I'm scared
So one of these bitches might wind up dead
'cause I have no time for bail. Fuck Clampett cops, fuck Elgin Bail
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinkin that my city is the big lick for 96
94, Big Gipp, Goodie Mo, Outkast, a vision from the past
Hootie hoo, my white owls are burning kinda slow

Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crackers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
So let me take ya way, back to when a nigga stayed in Southwest Atlanta
Y'all could not tell me nothing, thought I hit that bottom rock
At age 13, start working at the loading dock
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home Bank like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still acting a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Graduation rolled around like rolly-pollies
Damn, that's fucked up. I should of listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yin-yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feelin broke and shit
Huh, but that don't matter though, I am an O-UT-KAST
So get up off your ass",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-git-up-git-out-lyrics
Kolors,Age Against The Machine,2013,"Photographs are like mirrors
They can hold a body for a moment
I grew up on four corners
But jumped-in in a circle
$100 grand on a fuck nigga head
Cut his body into pizza, watched the cheese spread
Had to move out of touch from niggas fingers
You know how your friends are
They'll eat your whole box of Pringles
Leave crumbs in the backseat of the car
Walk past you in a crowded room
You conceded bastard, you
I don't talk when I ride, that's what the feet for
Ain't no pressure when you see me, that's what the heat for
Lucille Ball on the seashore expecting more out of niggas
Tell me the truth
Tell me how it really go
You don't have to say it no mo'
You on that different type of shit
That extra-ordinary shit
That shit that I don't understand
But I ain't gone say it no mo'
Kolors

You see black and white is the color of business
And now my dress shoes are dirty and discolored from going the distance
But for the right dollar sign, I do a white color crime
Cause I don’t need cash, I don’t need credit
Now there I’ve said it, yay
And I spell kolors with a K
But although my outfit is a flamer
I’m not a banger, I’m simply dressed in disclaimer
To save the life of a stranger
Uh, poor thing, you didn’t know that you were in danger
So now that you understand why I can’t be understated
Why this collaboration has to be completely kolor coordinated
Cause when you see a fin flag fall
That’s all it took!
Didn’t see the face of who did it, but the kolor was so vivid
Then you feel it, you owe it, then get quoted
Go out and catch it and kill it and vow to never forgive it
It’s a prison, not a paradise to pass through and visit
Capitol Road and Carson and Compton are completely committed
And if you live it, you better love it
Because they will push the line in public
Can’t be, bangin on a budget
You sweet banging on the subject
Where I’m from the red lights mean go
Two more teenagers in white tee’s mean blow
And wherever you go, no means no
And I gotta speed up, for you to be like oh he ain’t slow!
And now somebody else dead because yo he ain’t know
Well so he ain’t low

I was born in the real states
Where pale face contemplate
Every single day, oh, how to keep color folk in their place?
Suspended animation, like a black bear hibernatin'
Vital functions near to death
While the world of waste I'm awakening
That was me in'
Solitary bandana
Eating, fishing bricks
Representing that South West Atlanta
I stay ' my whole team bleeds
My heart hawks, falcons' what more prove do you need?
Soundtrack number one
America's dying slowly
Sacrifice blood, that's been different hemoglobin
The quest for green got you outbreak
Yellow stripes down your back
The quest for green got you outbreak
Yellow stripes down your back
But once you travel that road
It ain't no turning back!
Kolors!

Music is kolor, a range of fuse
PB King, sang the blues
Shades and tones' the sounds infused
A lot of commoners to a gangsta tool
The base goes boom, can feel the boom
Everything is black in the Cadillac
Symbolize the power when the roof will say
Hit the real dime, it's an earthquake
Do quiet times with the ones that '
Who can open your mind and lay a dime
At the same time, go from behind!
On your TV screen right before your eyes
You're hypnotized in a beautiful way
Watch the flowers bloom, is it love today
Is a mix show, you can have it your way
The trumpets play and the DJs play
Is a quiet storm right in front of your face
Hit the ' my saving ways
And the music beat standing in my place
I don't rap' I'm a bastard case
With no tools in the air, no time for waste
No time for waste!

You know how good it can be, if I took you home with me
I know the mood is right, I don't wanna be alone tonight
Come on lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty, dip
Lets dip shawty
(T-Mo)
Can I get a chance, grown man from afar superstar status
Holdin' on to the apparatus firmly
West shake show love heat 'em up in the club if you don't care
Conversations short, too many Newports blowing me away
To another broad, I mean cutie, with the nice round booty
Cut to the spot where all the girls wanna do me
On the low, nice and slow
T-mo on the floor, out the door lets go
Keep it on the hush, don't wanna rush when your ready
We can touch some G's, and blow trees in the wind
With a zip, I'm there, telling tales, out on bail
SWAT's tales of rolling boulders and breaking shoulders
Taking me closer to a poacher with that roll line
Shawty cause I'm down for mine
Hook
(Cee-Lo)
We at the club 112 on the front row
Shawty done shot the Cuervo
Even though she dancing with another niggeroe
Somewhere out on the floor
She told me Lo snap your finger when your ready to go
So you know I feel great, I can hardly wait
Hit the Waffle House and get a chicken-melt plate
Scrambled Eggs with cheese, and a pile of grease
And get full as a tick bout' ready to drip
And oh for trilly shawty don't be silly
Calm your nerves cause I'm back on that Philly
Cheifed like a champ, and everything is good
I got to much class, and I'll take you to school
I wanna act a fool, but I'm waiting patiently
It ain't good if it ain't been mentioned with me
And if your number fuck around and get hard to find
All I really wanna be is a thought in your mind
Hook
(Big Gipp)
Can I take you home
You grown, sip a tea, nice feet
Eyes fly too, saw you when you came through
By yourself girl, no crew
Can I hold you, can I show you
Everything in life, that I've been through
We can roll in the hills in my big wheel
98 Lank Lank with the Stank Stank
These lights, this night, my dream, your screams
Silk sheets, we meet, what you need a ride, I got Fleet's
Leather seats with the woodgrain head back
When I drop it like that, baby don't act
How many times do I say that I want your love
Lets dip this club
Hook
(Khujo)
God led me to The Shark Bar
On a Wednesday, with the dreads
White derby, looking delicious, good enough to eat
And what do I see, staring at me
A nice pair of eyes, coke bottle figure, wig, done to a T
Dressed in gangsta black, ready to be attacked by a real mack
Playing hard to get it, so I dips upstairs
How long will it take for my earrings to withdrawl
You is such a cold and lonely heart, I'll make you warm again
But it was something different about you though
You didn't ask for no autograph or swarm
All you needed was a hug
We being snug like fingers in the glove
8th grade was the last time a nigga was in love

Just About Over,Still Standing,1998.0,"Intro/Chorus: Cee-Lo and others (singing)
Heyy, so they tell me, it's just about over
Ohhh yeahhh-yeah, ohhhh yeahh-yeah
So they tell me, it's just about over
Ohhh yeahhh-yeah, ohhhhhh yeahh-yeah
Verse One: Cee-Lo (singing)
Well I'm lonely, and no one understands
The show has fallen, into the wrong hands
I am blinded, to see all that's passed
To know it was possible, to be a sadist
I have nothing, more to give
I have lost my, will to live
I lost my pride, lost my joy, and now I've lost my fear
I'd rather die, because I, am just that, unhappy here
Chorus
Verse Two: Gipp, Khujo
Man it's 20/20, uhh
It's gettin hard, to Main Street, the Boulevard
Earth warmin, causin the ozone to fall apart
Spark rebellion, I'mma go to, guillotine
The Palestines too, divide the land right, between you
Seas cross, dirt road walked
A lot of folks that don't know talk
Some that thought they made it got caught
Slay the wicked, spirit'll soon fix it
It's gettin colder I wonder how much older 'fore it's all over
Not long, 
it was sad, how you killed my son
On the four-zero-five, changin, his flat tire
Suspect's a white male, lead, a possible robbery
Hurts my heart that we start off this year
Like this
, 
players in position to make differences
But be, charged with rape
, with all that debit
While you had it, to take the ?gushy?
Twenties frozen this time
At this North/South planet clinic
Where abortions are performed
Verse Three: T-Mo
From the start, I see the end
Will we be friends in the end
Took you with me, solo creeps
Never wakin lay next to me sleep
Hate to use you, don't abuse you
I won't lose you, fought to keep you
He dyin to meet you, confrontation
Of the tainted thought, of me lettin you step to
I got caught, messin up again
I just can't win, tryin not to sin
When crackin the gin, makin fat distends
In a time we need to be sober
On my way through Georgia, headed back to Florida
With the Jimmy called Peanuts, mind
In the O, headed to a show
Gone with the strong, up out the do', now..

Angelic Wars,Set It Off (Original Soundtrack),UnKnown,"No ego trippin', just growin' old
All up when I'm feelin' cold
Cause pain up on my soul seems to be all I feel
Watchin' my family fall apart, was all I never wanted to see
Cause I got love for one another
I'd kill for my only brother, even though he might be wrong
At times I'm gon' do what I got to do to come through every scary moment
Just brought us closer which kept us down
Remember them days when southwest Atlanta wasn't even 'round
So out the reds to wet it
And say they actin' brains, relaxin'
And steady stackin' and pistol packin'
And trackin' is tired
I set it off!
I don't be sittin' in a trap slangin' lil' peewees
Tell Mike, ""Damn I'm 'bout to mess up my re-up money""
See, I used to wear my shoes until I couldn't no more
Now I hit the store, when the lace get old
I wear Calhoun jeans cause I don't like Calvin
I relate to my folks
To make you think this 'bout my third album
This supposed to be the times when the moon and the sky turn purple
So watch this full circle
Black wire touch red
Red wire touch black
Me and Big Slate got this drop wit some gator backs
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how much I make
He get the rims, I get the system and we leave him the tapes
Ya know what I'm sayin'
Who gives a damn about catchin' a charge
It's been a while since I seen my boys
One time for my potnas who got out today
Back on the grind, did that time, got that hide-away
Okay (that's right)
I just got to say
Two times for the crook who just got away
It done got so quiet now, I can here a rat piss
On cotton, one apple sport the whole
Barrel rotten
What it mean when you see the sun and the moon shinin'
At the same time
This God's way, you dug your own grave
The righteous path was laid
But you chose to go astray
Ay, out the war shit
Wakin' up in a cold sweat
Through the same ol' skit
Genocide
]From the inside, look a pit
You lie, never killed nobody
Let's take it to the ol' school
No you can't
Hands shakin' like a dog shittin' fish hooks
Don't stare
Can't help the crooked look
It came with the face
I used to steal from my folks
But now I'm straight
Went through the neighborhood rat's pockets books
Ooh
You missin' somethin' of value
We have you, got you
Jumpin', dumb bitch, you gets nothin'
Nobody knows the trouble I have seen
My homeboy MD write me from the ?
24-7, hell or Heaven, it ain't no tellin'
Will it be mo' sunshine for the due time felon
They gave him 10, do 3, self year, probation
Law leaders not, unto no temptation
Yall know how it be
You make a monkey move, lay yourself on the street
You'll understand me
They don't care nuttin' 'bout you
In that cold cell
Can't do nuttin' but take what them folk give me
I'm dead serious
Them folk givin' away time
Just to show us the good Lord keep lettin' the sun shine
One time for them niggas who got out today
And my folks on stokes

When so many didn't have an alternative to see
Music saved my life and now I'll never forget it
Thats why I try to glorify God with it
But it still remains, its in my veins
I know that I'mma sin, I just hope he'll forgive me again
Okay, I'm right and wrong in the same day
And it's always gonna be someone who'll see it the same way
And if I react, who was that guy to blame, hey
You fuck with me, I fuck with you thats how the game played
I had a choice to let it go, but if you don't let it go
Then I ain't got no choice no more
Two lives gone to waste, one dead and the other caught a case
With 50 years to face
Amazing Grace, I'm rebuilding

Hoping to run, but there's a gun, what could you really do
Everybody new kicking the old ??? to the floor
But now its more shit, crooked, shady, talking 'bout the president
He's fucking other ladies, blowing up spots we supposed to hit
And casually they spreading billions to the little children overseas
Niggas moving G's, I'm on my knees praying god please
A nigga just wanna eat and sleep
With my gun in my own little world and raise my little kids
Doing the best I can nigga

Shit, look who talking now
You gots'ta crawl before you walk, Ohh don't follow too close
Where I think you might stop
We all can see that the grass is the same color on the other side of the fence
Give thanks, people thank alarm clocks, wake 'em up
Every morning brother I gotta stay prayed up
Cause the pistol ain't gonna save my life when it's time to go
Its just in case I get a chance to retaliate
I used ain't have nothing positive to say
Doing my little five minutes of fame
Who done forgot from which they came
Acknowledge his name, Lord, you've been so good to me
Better than I've been to myself
Keep us in good health
The white mans food makes my stomach upchuck
But I gots'ta be strong, to defeat my enemies

Dirty past, with the future bout to bust you in ya face
You didn't know that Ghetto Boys and Goodie Mob was in the place
We workin' on a punk ass nigga

And it wasn't until recently
That I realized that I had it wrong!
See when I wouldn't be your stereotype
The doors kept getting shut
But now after everybody's gotten to know me
I'm out to claim what I want!
So what are you talking about?
What you looking funny at?
White power's actually when you use that money
To make that money back!
So it's not about black or white
It's about Cee-lo Green!
Now I really understand what they mean
When they say..

White Power!
White Power! (yeah!)

Remember What I Said,Fled Original Soundtrack Album,1996.0,"Trying to keep my head above water
Selling myself short to meet the fucking quota
Still there's niggas at my heels to get my paper
Stacking up in the bank, the layers on the cake-a
Thinking like Jimmy, Tami, oh it's low down
Niggas be getting mad as I go 'round like Pac
The shit don't stop, I hid the rock in my sock
Did my day and a half, now it's autographs I be signing
Instead of police papers
Caught scheming, not pulling capers, no fed time
Just mental healing
What you dealing with? The angelic uplift
It's a way to save everything with your gift
(Yeah)
Now a seed to a tree was to be
(Yeah)
A boy to a man comes up quickest like a dream
You really don't understand why
'Til you gone and dead
So when your time comes
Just remember what I said
Human'll find truth to tell a lie
Take away my past and don't show me I can fly
Sly like Stone, it's on, you say peace
I can't relate homes, I'm on the fucking streets
Believe it or not, I'm sure there be calmer situations
When dirty cops approach me joe, I'm on probation
Hesitating could get me took
What can I do? Mildew?
Can I take your place on your next trip to
The islands of Alto, so it's going down like that
I'm back to bat dropping wits on wax
To fit into the mix of the rich and scan'lous
Can't let 'em handle us any kind of way, fuck it
And run away, I don't want it torn joe
I think they gay, don't wanna play my shit up north
But that's okay, jealousy can go a long way
And what goes around comes around in the A-town

Have you ever thought about what it would be like
If everybody woke up and said ""Fuck work""
Webs of small talk, people caught up in this thing
I try to relax, but I stay shaking like the blue flame
It keeps coming, this and that, that and this
Another suing me, well I add him to the list
Flows and flows, with the girls with the tight clothes
Saying anything to get off in these back doors
Irritating like what's on them thirties
Ain't looking for no more friends, I got enough buddies
A thousand attempts with thirty cents to their name
I got enough pine but I can't find the flame
Sweet like honeysuckles, country like that cha cha on the green
Jumping fences and rooms with large laughter
Original gene grafter, more and more ways to eat
Brews tested by the astronauts, turn the turn the watts up
Listen to what I said
CNN all day in your eyes and your head

No longer can I ask when I'm in your presence
Now it's hard to tell whether you're trying to hurt or help me
At the bottom of this barrel scraping
Next time I promise to stand for self-determination
Instead of always taking from cool
Keeping the same color as you and me, continue to battle DNA
Let's travel to a remote city get back, have mercy
Unravel and break the chains of chemical dependency
Plastic can eventually explode bits and pieces of my soul
Shattering, just not being put back together
We can rule, but still brothers won't use that tool
In between their shoulders, click
Hearts cold as bricks, nipples what better way to cripple
An entire race on the paper chase
Getting my toes stepped on, then kicked in my face
Every time I open my mouth I represent the South
Dirty like red, it was the lifestyle I led
Worshipping vanity, fornicating out of wedlock
Locked in yesterday's trunk of secrets, I fled
Went from sugar to sheet rock
Get your rocks, sweet licks turn sour
By the hour, over on tiger flower
If that light went on that meant go
Say what you really mean, I atone
For all the women I abused as a youngster
People got four fifths out this dumpster

Compositions should be able to make the connections
From reflections of living
Why every breath is God-given
Appreciating, especially waiting
Letting time do the educating
In order to know
Sunshine and the rain are both needed
Or the seed can't grow
It's given me some form of inner vision
How the paragraphs are prepared with precision
Unveiling evidence that this is no coincidence
We've been sent
Judge not by my skin color but my character's content
In no way is this an attempt to claim to be exempt
From my people's situations, but I have moral obligations
See I want to be all right with God
Long conversations at night with God
My arms are gonna always be too short to fight with God
To all this might not be appealing
But I can't help feeling the way I do
I realize that my reward won't come from any of you
See everybody got a little light under the sunshine
But unselfishly I still want to share mine
And what you choose to do is on you
You've got to stand on your own feet cause I ain't got but two
I can't knock you for not knowing
But I could for you not wanting to learn
Nor for asking, but I could for you not wanting to earn
No I can't, cause somebody even had to tell me twice
So this music is my sacrifice, so I'll be dedicated
Determinated and dependable, to demonstrate directly
And use the opportunity correctly
So forget the gold teeth
And uh, and uh
Forget the bald head
Forget it sound country
Just remember what I said",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-remember-what-i-said-lyrics
Hold On,"Big Boi Presents... Got Purp, Volume 2",UnKnown,"Look out the sun is out while its raining
The devils wife must be complaining
Remember that? its brothers work
Elbows in and up and down the court
Cause they play ball long after dark at Sykes park
Smelled the rain before it came
But that don't stop the game
Intense inside the twelve feet fence
Flip the mode back on the road set in
And watch my woodgrain spin
I let my window down and let the world in
Since I was knee high the only thing we had was the peachtree plaza in the sky
Things ain't the same no more
Everyday my city seems to grow and grow
Gotta blow a bed for my back
Cause I can't take the hardwood floors
Crooked system had me working in the warehouse
From 8 to 4 so
Gipp know what it is to work for them foes for a check that don't mean shit
More bills keep coming in
But ain't no saving
Used to scrape up a buck for a box of newports
But after I found out
That they was fucking with the tobac I stopped
Its like killing myself with a Glock (pow)
Its rough
Prices going up people giving in
To the rockets and hernon homes is known
By the city to be toxic but ain't nothin said
Always on the down low never in the mainstream
It ain't king
To be the fulltime
Blow a man these days you get years
And even though..
My cousin writes me from the pen
I always think about how we kicked it at the Dungeon fo' he went in
What's next?
My slick partner Toby is gone
Went to handle a little business never made it back home
I wonder what his girl told his son.......
Hold on

I can't escape the bullshit
Where ever I go shit
Always into something cause I wanna be rich
Pulling cards in my blood it seems I'm mean cause of my look
I might blast off on ya ass and write another book
It took too many times in the cage
Now I'm on the front page looking at myself
I'm on the run
Never to be seen by the eyes
A fugitive
Plus I got a life to live
State by state
Is this just a dream?
Sometimes it seems like it just a figure standing in the mirror from the back
That's why I'm swinging my axe
Everytime so I won't miss I can be hit
Cause I'm touchable
That's my state of mind
Cause I know one day you gotta go in a life of crime
Either the pen or a one way ticket
So I'm asking ""what will it be""?
""Where do I solve""?
Nobody knows but me see
When I was a youth used to think I was bulletproof
Never thought I could be hit
Ready to stand my turf
Niggas can't understand how it work
What's the plan?
We killing our own people for this bullshit
Scared straight wanna escape theres one way outta this crooked county
With a bounty
Coming to get me
Then i'd be on the run
Hoping to find a better day without loaded guns in my face
I'm not the criminal
Fuck your probation
What's my occupation? Selling my dubbs on the street
Cause I gotta eat
Hold on

Am I awake or is this just another dream?
I pinch myself invisible bars cover my cage
Done lost all conception of time
Trapped in my own mind
Unaware of the world in front or behind
Be trying
To catch up with myself
Evil doers steady working
Guest be leaching off of my wealth
Can't wait for my death
But got me fucked up
Ain't man enough
Nigga you got false nuts
Bouncing like rubber balls off the walls
The life we supposed to be living y'all
Them crackers got boxed up
We ain't even the middle men
But..yet... free my mind of confusion
Jehovah witnesses waking me up out my slumber
Using white rice and ??
Stomach aching be still hunger for the taking at the bottom of my barrel
Fuck ass! and being nice ain't got me nathan
But a frown
Too high to get down
Hold on nigga

You don't know me
And I ain't tryna claim I be knowing you
But I do understand what you going through
Seems like you running outta time
In and out of crime
And everybody ain't gon be able to rhyme..damn!
It must be hard to hold on when your faith is gone
Mmmm...tryna make it all alone
Sometimes you gotta swallow your pride and let the lord decide
You can't hide from the truth I know we've all tried
And I agree its hard to believe in what you can't see
""Well, shit nigga what you keep telling me to hold on for? I'm stuck in
The ghetto wit no where to go, I gotta slang that blow""
""You call yourself tryna teach, seems like I'm outta reach
Cause I don't wanna hear another speech
This is all I know how to get up get out and get...

Now when I saw you in the club, all I did was stare
Intimidated by my golds and my long ass hair
But I couldn't let you pass, and didn't even care
I had to make conversation, and let you know this here
Who am I, the well known T-Mo, represent the G Mo B
Trinity to infinity
Baby whats your name, where you came from
Where you get your game from, I bet you learned a lot growing up
Being a cute lil' thang, like to bang with the big dawgs
Roll in the big hogs, 18, living life raw
Little shawty was a dream
Had to put up my dream my brother had
Hook

Well my dear, this here you can quote
Carlitto will cut your motherfucking throat
Left low, you can ride shotgun in the boat
Hit my red light digit and thats all she wrote
Of course, she shaped like a stallion horse
Goddammit, shawty finish your drink
We going to get a room, what the hell you think
I'll buy you something to eat, but you can't break the bank
First time, the gold plate from the IHOP
Then to the inn to umm drop, plop plop, fizz fizz oh what a relief it is
Get it, got it gone, now he out for his

Hey Jo (huh?), I know this girl that wanna cut your throat
(Khujo)
Hold up shawty
Before you finna to get your boy in some serious trouble man
I'm talking bout' cost cutting (snip-snip), ain't nothing
Tell her all we can do together, is make this grip-grip
She talking 'bout chiefing, sipping, bending and stripping
I ain't chicken fool, you know I'm ranged up
All these fools around here may be harder
But I ain't studying this young buck
Jail baits are best seen hiking the drawls
And looking for a daddy to cake her
(Sleepy Brown)
All you gotta do is take her out, stuff her face, get her pumped
Put her on the chopping block, now she nice and crunk
(Khujo)
But I ain't no punk dutty
Heard if you stick your thumb in their booty it drive 'em nutty
She'll walk nann day, owe me but a cent and out when I'm through boo
Now you know the real meaning of cutty
Hook
(Big Gipp)
Gipp cutty, they call me too fresh too clean
Got the girls hooked off the D like morphine
Where we gonna go, I don't know but lets hit it
With the strawberries, blueberries, looking for the tooth fairy
For the night out, downtown, second floor, in the loft with the lights out
Candles straight burning
Everybody hot, clothes on the floor
You ain't know, yo we got some hollywood cake we can slice Mrs. Meyer
Even got some twins that can get in
Head for head, bed for bed, it don't matter
Everything jumping off just right, and we ain't leaving till the sunlight
Cause we undercover with our cutty buddy

Now I say my rap reflect the enemy
Passion and positive energy
Y'all talk about killing, it don't surprise me
Tripping bout' a nigga, don't judge me wisely
But I ain't bout' to holler or scream at you
You can look in my eyes and tell what I'd do
I'm a charge at niggas and you know I'm true
But goddammit, fuck nigga this one for you
I know how it go, I done been out there before
Heard its goddamn ?time to blow?
Stomping niggas down till they don't want no more
Trying to get some Polo's straight out the store
Some gone, some just can't let it go
I might laugh and joke, but I'll let a nigga know
I'm the same motherfucker from 84
And I still do it in the aftershow
And I don't like to feel like I'm being tried
I ain't bullet-proof, plenty nigga done died
But I damn sho' ain't finna go and hide
I got one on me, and I'm down to ride
I ain't trying to say I got all the game
I got fame, but a million I can't claim
So respect me playa, and I'll do the same
But neither one is guaranteed to have the best aim

The revolution has begun...........
Handle your business playa
Devoted to the game, and dope cut-throat ways will get you paid in full
Pull a rabbit out the hat trick, magical quick
Slick its like a porn flick
Umm... Imagine having money so big
It makes you look like a pig
Get your big behind
You remind me of swine with your fat nose
Stuck in your pose and ?thread bed? that shawty
Lame with your game, put it all on the table
Got your label and your fast cars, and your bodyguard looking hard
Throwing your cheese, for them rats its snacks
I'm like a egg bout' to hatch
Tony, horny, I'm macaroni
Commercialize suckers looking like busters
I'd ride for the kings and queens of my motherfucking team
Spark in the night, ummmm we bout to fight
Haters, come and say that shit
Dammit these fools gonna have to take us together
How the fuck, ever you want it, get to it
SWATS

(Khujo)
The streets making you feel like a real G
But we Georgia finest, our Fulton County fleet
You still putting thangs up in your mouth
Cause you been pacifired, since you was knee-high
All your life in school, thats the reason why you couldn't learn nothing
Runt, at the tender age of 18, books no longer hold your attention span
Short term, but you can sho' enough count that green
Something you just can't coach
Don't sing it, bring it
I usually caught me at least one fool a game
You can only phanthom pain, I don't have to
But don't let me get on a case of this drank
Leak to my heart, elevate to my brain
Make you wanna walk that plank
You'd better swim motherfucker
Cause bullshit don't float
You are what you eat
See you remind of this goat that I had by the hairs of his chinny-chin-chin
Curbing over some yellow rice, you can't do shit
Might as well hit the graveyard shift
Somewhere at McDonalds or Burger King
Grab a taste or spill, over some hairs, nobody cares
And we do assholes that grip leather chairs
Hook
(Big Gipp)
I used to hang out, smoke out, fuck out, bang out
Run your mouth wrong, got your front tooth took out
On the spot bodies with no heads, no legs, no feet
Left em' out in the open scoping that ass out for weeks
Never speaking, busting, breaking brains
Berettas brought the rain back and forth
Trigger action, snatch it up, load it up
Hit the door, gotta call, yo' he at the mall
Fuck it all, hit em' one, two, three times
I was scared the first shot, but liked the second and third
Left him hollering and screaming, dreaming for another chance to live
Had it up yesterday, but today its mine
Bust your ass one more time, for the niggas on the grind
So go and hide

This is for all my homeboys who didn't get to see a new year
Yeah, yo
 X 2
This for my homeboys dead and gone
Off in the bushes, we pour out liquor, and roll up swisher smoke

The hood has changed since you left, man
I see your mom and dad got a new jag
Little Jason work at Papa John's, saw your other brother Kelly
In the basement at Killer Bee's house
Tuesday night fights, ESPN, Sportcenter, big screen
You know how these Eastpoint vets do
Can you recall riding bicycles in the trails behind
Krissy Collins dropping Huffys like BMX's
Your first car was a Honda, my first car was a rabbit
Cut parties with a tall can or something
Off in the 800 Ol' E, man, that old girl
She always fell, drunk off the pink champell
Yeah, reminiscing going through adolescence with you
Hoping that these words get to you in good spirit
Your partna Gipp won't forget you, my little brother
Went to prison last week, since he been in we barely speak

Rest in peace, to all the brothers
And sisters who didn't make it to see, a struggle
In the flesh, my folk thought I'm in the carcus
I don't worship the sun no more, I follow David Carresh
So I'm living right, the tears of many with a
Sheet pulled over my fucking head, I'm hanging in there
Like a wasp nest, meanwhile niggas is quiting on me
Falling victum to stress
I'm filling it with your diction homie,but that don't
Take away from my spirit and my mind, one time
For my homie Barat, and my homie Quentin
And my shawty Felicia, and my partna Floppy
I'm still living for you, I'm still swinging on a nigga
Still pulling on a flicker flicker, as I inhale the smoke
With my kinfolk, G-double O-D-I-E
M-O-B for L-I-F-E
 X 4

You want this gold clean and shining
Don't need to remind me about the divine, he polishes
And demolish his competitors, who was the editor
To bad mouth these boys that bred in the South
Where chicken's fried on the daily, and rebel flags fly
I have no love for confederate sons but guns
And no hogs' good for me, people like my type
To spark the spiritual fight with the devil off tonight
When he's white, at anytime, and any rhyme
With substance is looked at as racist
When good ol' boys is still doing hangings
And Mississippi having no pity on my color skin
Not having a choice from the begin, little brothers
Like me to pose a physical threat, but check
Let me grab a hold of my black steel
And I'll show all y'all who's real c'mon

And baby a little pot of dough, I got fly hoes already bitch
And I started pimping an hour ago
Uh, I know that you be watching
Trying to play with my intelligence, I circulate the West
And what I calculate baby just from you taking up my time
Everything you got in every pocket you want is mine
Cadillac and Coup DeVilles dipping through the villa
Teaching the motherfuckers pretending to be realer
Hang on, and don't you let go
I got game to make the rain freeze like snow

Like some honey baked toast
Walking the hood comatose 21, 24 hours out the day
In the lord I pray, but the S-K
Spray a little bit then the police will come
Holding my nuts every time I don't run
Hung in the hood, in the slums, in the PJs
In the ghetto deep in the country the wood with no streetlights
Slide to the left baby I'mma hit it right
Came into the front yard, on-on-one fist fight
O. G.'s from the hood told me to keep my shit right
And if they try my mama house, I'll take the first flight
The same niggas that said they had my back
They got them folks sniffing 'round my pine
I'm gone

People sleeping, on the street

Don't think I got it gravy when you see 'Jo Goodie on T.V
I know this gon be the death of me
But situations and circumstances got be twisting broccoli
Last year, the devil tried to kill me
But y'all showed mercy, on him, he pleased
Now I'm a below the knee amputee, back on the street
Happily married with four kids, and I'll still split your wig

People play your flutes
I hope I get to you

Before you got on, I could a hear a pins drop
Maybe make me wanna clean out your clock
Go in your socks, confiscate your knot
Cool you off, because you think your hot, when your not
Fools on the block, will take your hand, brigettes and rocks
And your watch
Can't wait until you come through
One more 'gain so they can empty your bins
Check your chin, don't try and be my friend
Get close and then attempt to do me in
Niggas know you'll spin, we can get on that Henn, eyes shut

Never gonna change, try to stay focused
Still running with the same crew since 82'

Your smelling classic baby

Lets cut a rug and split this scene and strut up out this club
I be 'bout strictly business
I make it better, get it better than the last dude
Where I hang ain't no drama momma

Keep it wet, keep you stuck, all up on the jewels
And keep you seeing colors like on the wall at MJQ

Every word that I'd heard her say it really inspired me

Maybe next life-time you'll be free

Ghost of Gloria Goodchild,Age Against The Machine,2013,"This song summons the spirit of a soul stolen away. Sad, but true
And it works every time, but it hurts every time. But it's somethin' I had to do
Gloria's from a small town where thinkin' out loud's against the law
Then she realized she felt a whole lot better with her back against the wall
(She said) ""This fire inside me, how dare this place deprive me?""
""I want this. I NEED this. I'm wounded and I bleed this""
She was the real thing, a rebel soul; woulda died to be here tonight
And she did, so I sing this to celebrate her life
Chorus 
Gloria, star down the power sister
Gloria, I make you this promise that I
I'll cry for you. No I will never
Let your life be in vain. You're gonna live forever!

A conversation quickly turned into confrontation
No longer daddy's little girl, that was confirmation
Stubborn like her mother was, her spirit was so free
She ain't take no for an answer, he found that rather unique
Her soul was meek, but she was a renegade for hip-hop
Daddy called it devil music and said it had to stop
Instead of the shots, she stole the keys and took the car and left
I guess it was nice to know that I was loved to death
Chorus 

Runnin' runnin' to get away
Happened too fast to be afraid
Time, time ain't on our side
Heaven or hell, you decide
Put your lighters in the air to show you really care
Hold your neighbor's hands, close your eyes and say a prayer
I feel it in the air, her presence everywhere
We celebrate her spirit, I can hear the people cheer

And a nigga done read history but yet his eyes didn't see
The only reason you a nigga is because somebody else wants you to be
Well a nigga uneducated, intergrated, singin' ""We shall overcome""
A nigga trying to be white is what a nigga seem like have become
And when they call me a nigga to my face'
Can't do nothin' but walk away
But here it is niggers call other niggers niggers each and every day
Dividing and conquering
When they say the lighter shade of black is okay
After the middle class and they passin' by
The project laughin' at where we stay
Since a nigga had got grown, had a little bitty of nigga of my own
Should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'

To offer me some wisdom from this notebook she read
And it said that right then the black man's downfall
Was not know that we were not ever niggers at all, hmm
And she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
You complain about being black
When they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
So many black men out here trying to be niggers
Keeping it real to the point that they dying to be niggers
When in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigga because you black
You a nigga cause of how you act
But, you don't want me to tell you the truth, so I'mma lie to you
Make it sound fly to you huh, huh
You don't wanna hear the truth, so I'mma lie to you

Up the straight big crowd finally put it down
Take your kindness for real until you bust it down
In the sail big song would be hard to crack
If you're the tall tree, then I'm the small X
Can't relax, pandemonium in hard times
We left the package at the faux at the finish line
People die heart is wounded massive trauma
Now it's all for the bust of marathon balls
In the valley soft kill for big faces
Others do it for the fame raising new faces
Paper breathing ground for foreign and then making threats
In the land of the free I can do violence

When you're in the valley

So I get on my hands and knees and start a fight
I don't have to look behind it

The same face when civilians turned savage
Back baby killers for the rights of passage
All the bys blood face smashes on the counters
Life is literally all penitentiary chances
And you can tell when someone is taking illuminati advances
And the way he dances
You got a half heart cause it can feel as in between the building
And contract killers got them hanging from the ceilings
What with America in a cubicle replacing
All of your free flows will come to basement
And you can sell your soul in the black market
And ironically, everyone that is black is a target
The real hunger games, the real hunger pains

So I get on my hands and knees and start a fight

Strong protection but the raw selection leaves your voice choiceless

Why can't we see that the path we walk is free but still predestined?
I know it's tough to understand, but every decision ever made
Is all part of the same plan

Sweet little southern girl

Oh, looking at the sun is going down
Show me around I'm going down

And that ain't sophisticated and it sure ain't hard
The criminal ' in your yard


Love that lady, maybe that prestigious
Lulu dresses sweet look lady
She like hell .. but I don't know
Country boy know like they ..
Wanna buy the whole thing no lieces
And tag your .. so caught my eye


What up? Little butter cup
I'm feelin' deep in sunshine and can set you up
But you see the forest for the trees
See the number one with she's
But they ain't talking 'bout fast food
I f*ck her with the long way I give up my last food
One it look seems cook it",https://genius.com/Goodie-mob-southern-girl-lyrics
Just A Song,Bamboozled (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),UnKnown,"I have no face, I have no body, I have no heart I have no soul
I don't care if you're young if you're old
Here's my mission, I'm out to get them, those who be slippin
Creepin, while they be creepin, I be enterin
Into them, silently, violently, that's not me
Quietly, you'll never know I'm in your blood stream
Swimming, I been injected, now you're infected
And when you find me here it will be worse than you expected
Temptation, that's how I get in, that's how I got in
Information, is what you lackin, now I'm attackin
Your mind, and body functions, don't seem to function
Somethin, ain't how it used to be and it's because of me
Killin you, cold-blooded murderer
The bible told the world I would be here and now I'm servin ya
Along with the floods mass destruction and wars
You can listen to me, but the choice is yours
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should've had my jimmy hat strapped on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness it's more than just a song
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
I got no concious, killing by the bunches, how can I see with no eyes?
The protected people I'm taking em by surprise, I despise
Any type of Doctor, thinking he can stop a
Epidemic built across the nation, can't stop temptation listen
Who in the hell gonna stop you when, I get in your mind then
Tell you squats with a girl I'm bein, hit a broad from behind, I'm
All up in the walls of the womb, your doom is incognito
You constantly putting your life in my hands, thinking you didn't see no
Evidence that made it irrelevant I'm hangin out up in the system
On the scene mean stuffed in them jeans, is how she did them
If it was up to me I'd get with you all, but I really don't pick em
How one by one she lures them in, I'm the one who tricks them
Your coffin sealin temperature chillin the silent killer
I done sucked a whole life, twice the cells of Mike's Thriller
If a victim want to be loved, gun and will travel
Anywhere with any broad, the buster now you ain't grabbin me ta
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I shoulda told him to put a condom on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness it's more than just a song man
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cutting corners in your bones
Lord tell me why was I born in the days of bloodshed
Players and neighborhoods full of the walking dead
Poison is cooked, and smoked, and shot into our veins
Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous echo through our brains
Misguided, the big picture over the small picture
That's how the devil makes a man interpretate the scripture
Rotten, born dead into a sea of sinners
Young girls are pros, before they can become beginners
Booty shakers sellin sex to pay they college tuition
Jealousy, send our brothers on straight pistol missions
And in the midst of the drama mama can I save ya
Now you remember all the hell she went through tryin ta raise ya
But it's too late for that, in this predicament
You shoulda been thinking of this when you was flickin it, stickin it
But who am I? Just another man running his mouth
Giving you something to think about, my time is up, I'm out
If you ain't realized by now, the description of the topic here is AIDS
Several amounts of times I will appear on the front page
Never be thinking about the filthy hoes in which I've laid
Down deep in the dungeons next to the devil is where I stayed
Never be thinking about the backs I rode and what I weighed
Now everything that's important in your life is just a daze
Being a damn fool trying to prove you wasn't afraid
Wasn't intending to do it but yet and still at times you made
Moves within the game that should never have been played
Whether you old or whether it struck you at an early age
No difference between the two, cause they both in the same stage
Curiosity killed the cat the cat was standin in front of the gauge
It seems the whole subject keeps the world within a daze
Well this is the fact
That some of these people be thinkin they can't be fazed
Worldwide plague slowly turning into a rage
Up and down side to side heterosex and gays need to
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should've had my jimmy hat strapped on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness, it's more than just a song man
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I'm rolling through your skin cuttin corners in your bones
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
I knew I should have told him to put a condom on
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
There's a message to my madness, it's more than just a song
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""
My fantasy was fulfilled, but my life is still gone
""Listen to me now, believe me later on""

Big Gipp understand this, king of the A-list
Cocker Spaniel poker, lonely girl stroker
You the first lady and Im the first string chauffeur
Met you at a nightclub VIP sofa
You caught my eye, youre so fly, your smile
Your dress and your diamond chip choker
It really feels good to know ya, sip mimosa
It might bring us closer if ya left me right now
Hurts like I know sir

The one I want to make it look like Im a big baller
Yes yallin, Boss Hoggin
But what you see ain't always whatcha get
A black man hustlin, grindin, findin
His way through the darkness
Regardless of circumstances situations facin
Just like you I got bills to pay too
They can give a damn bout who I rap with
Whats your crew been through?
Groupies, gold diggers
Stop a shorty I respect your gangsta

Where my pointy toes? Where my forty-four?
Where my blow? Where the dough? Where the club at?
Thats where the thugs at, where the love at?
Where the green? Where the fruity?
Come here girl, let me wild out on you booty
Hey where the hook up? Time to cook up
Never put the good book up
Where God? He right in the heart
Play some spades, where my cards?

Dont let this shit fool you
Im on the grind tryna get mine too

I hate pretty-boy raps
But I love getting love in my lap, shootin big craps
Life is just a gamble
Like a double platinum album of the fireplace mantle
Sexy women capture my attention (hey shorty)
But I dig fly conversation
Solid occupations, ladies that wear business suits
Independent like Beyonc, world renowned like Janet
That cause us all to pay attention
Because we see em on the TV
And we hear em on the radio waves
Slave to the street, hustle cause I got to eat
Muscle my way through Peachtree City
Pity the fool that disrespect my queens
Get it how she get it
Puttin food on the table, DVD players with cable
Corinthian leather sofas, Persian rugs
Range Rovers, four leaf clovers that smell like blueberry dosha

Keep yo brains unchained

If the pain don't stain

And that's just plain insane
So I refrain from lames
Ain't never played no games
And I ain't gon lay no blames
Cuz I'm black and still trill, too
Take from me, I will kill you
By whatever means available
Whatever's viable asyllable
It's hellable of shit niggas
This ain't no click of just niggas
This is an order of Dungeon Family, Renegade Crusaders
And we gone make you believe in this here shit like we made us
Just like he ain't paid us
These crack ass niggas must really think though as if we made it
Niggas lift ya shades up
So I can see the soul of the fakers that I'm terriifying
Out here thundering, still clapping
And the lightening still blinding
The truth still hurts
Comin' real still works
Kilts and steel skirts
Though they still twerk
Emotions still leave niggas to idiotic actions
And lots of people still caught up in just physical
Attractions
The fans, the business, the life so demanding

And fold your hand daddy ought to clear your mind
Used to stick your chest out son cause I was your father
Gave you pride about your south side cause I was your father
Use to listen to the tape pop and roll your quarter
Let me slow down and state some fact
I put coal in my mouth they used to call me jars
I'm in the 84 legs with the jaws
Dodging family (?) 100 Gs
Who you thinking big brothers baby wanna be

But I've been inspired in it
Set the standards for grimey, intellectual niggas
Sothern realist they flow so deliberate
Boy killing me and out the new under the sun
Sit back listen I tell you how the south was won
With big guns, deep pockets and hard heads
Every go prison threads
Never scared raised the bar why you so detailed

What the hell?

As I notice a simple apparel
Of different characters in the matrix they were learning
I'm your papi I'm the reason you were rapping
I got no time for napping you still have (?)
You asking me what happened

Open up your brains and we go back to the pains
The facts still remain be careful with the chain

We're leaders, we're soldiers

I contemplated completely killing my son
I f I can catch the wrath they're stealing my son
To me got my own life I am willing my son
Yeah I remember stalling the I saw them stealing my gun
Before I started building my son I was stealing for crime
Can't tell the difference on how I was feeling
The four walls, the floor and the ceiling
And right outside the front door the kids were killing for fun
And he had a room with a view
And a couple of times he saw his daddy go outside and have some fun too

Stomping niggas down till they don't want no more
Trying to get some Polo's straight out the store
Some gone, some just can't let it go

It makes you look like a pig, get your big behind
You remind me of swine with your fat nose
Stuck in your pose and ?thread bed? that shawty
Lame with your game, put it all on the table
Got your label and your fast cars, and your bodyguard looking hard
Throwing your cheese, for them rats its snacks
I'm like a egg bout' to hatch
Tony, horny, I'm macaroni
Commercialize suckers looking like busters
I'd ride for the kings and queens of my motherfucking team

Cause you been pacifired, since you was knee-high
All your life in school, thats the reason why
You couldn't learn nothing
Runt, at the tender age of 18, books
No longer hold your attention span
Short term, but you can sho' enough count that green
Something you just can't coach
Don't sing it, bring it
I usually caught me at least one fool a game
You can only fathom pain, I don't have to
But don't let me get on a case of this drank
Leak to my heart, elevate to my brain
Make you wanna walk that plank
You'd better swim motherfucker
'Cause bullshit don't float
You are what you eat
See you remind of this goat that I had
By the hairs of his chinny-chin-chin
Curbing over some yellow rice, you can't do shit
Might as well hit the graveyard shift
Somewhere at McDonalds or Burger King
Grab a taste or spill, over some hairs, nobody cares
And we do assholes that grip leather chairs

I used to hang out, smoke out, fuck out, bang out
Run your mouth wrong, got your front tooth took out
On the spot bodies with no heads, no legs, no feet
Left 'em out in the open scoping that ass out for weeks
Never speaking, busting, breaking brains
Berettas brought the rain back and forth
Trigger action, snatch it up, load it up
Hit the door, gotta call, yo' he at the mall
Fuck it all, hit 'em one, two, three times
I was scared the first shot, but liked the second and third
Left him hollering and screaming, dreaming for another chance to live
Had it up yesterday, but today it's mine
Bust your ass one more time, for the niggas on the grind
