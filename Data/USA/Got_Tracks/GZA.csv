Liquid Swords,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"When I was little, my father was famous
He was the greatest samurai in the empire
And he was the Shogun's decapitator
He cut off the heads of a hundred and thirty-one lords
It was a bad time for the empire
The Shogun just stayed inside his castle and he never came out
People said his brain was infected by devils
My father would come home, he would forget about the killings
He wasn't scared of the Shogun, but the Shogun was scared of him
Maybe that was the problem
Then, one night, the Shogun sent his ninja spies to our house
They were supposed to kill my father but they didn't
That was the night everything changed

See, sometimes
You gotta flash 'em back
See niggas don't know where this shit started
Y'all know where it came from
I'm saying we gonna take y'all back to the source
Do the knowledge, yo

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut

Fake niggas get flipped
In mic fights I swing swords and cut clowns
Shit is too swift to bite you record and write it down
I flow like the blood on a murder scene, like a syringe
On some wild out shit, to insert a fiend
But it was your op to shop stolen art
Catch a swollen heart from not rolling smart
I put mad pressure, on phony wack rhymes that get hurt
Shit's played like zodiac signs on sweatshirts
That's minimum, and feminine like sandals
My minimum table stacks a verse on a gamble
Energy is felt once the cards are dealt
With the impact of roundhouse kicks from black belts
That attack, the mic-fones like cyclones or typhoon
I represent from midnight to high noon
I don't waste ink, nigga, I think
I drop megaton bombs more faster than you blink
Cause rhyme thoughts travel at a tremendous speed
Clouds of smoke, of natural blends of weed
Only under one circumstance that's if I'm blunted
Turn that shit up, my Clan in the front want it

Now when the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut

I'm on a mission that niggas say is impossible
But when I swing my swords they all choppable
I be the body dropper, the heartbeat stopper
Child educator, plus head amputator
'Cause niggas styles are old like Mark 5 sneakers
Lyrics are weak like clock radio speakers
Don't even stop in my station and attack
While your plan failed, get derailed like Amtrak
What the fuck for? Down by law,
 
I make law
I be justice, I sentence that ass two to four
Round the clock, that state pen time, check it
But the pens I be sticking with, you can't state the crime
Came through with the Wu,
 
slid off on the DL
I'm low-key like seashells,
 
I rock these bells
Now come aboard, 
it's Medina bound
Enter the chamber, and it's a whole different sound
It's a wide entrance, small exit like a funnel
So deep it's picked up on radios in tunnels
Niggas are fascinated how the shit begin
Get vaccinated, my logo is branded in your skin

When the MCs came to live out the name and to perform
Some had to snort cocaine to act insane before Pete rocked it on
Now on with the mental plane to spark the brain with the building to be born
Yo, RZA, flip the track with the what to cut",https://genius.com/Gza-liquid-swords-lyrics
4th Chamber,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"Choose the sword, and you will join me
Choose the ball, and you join your mother... in death
You don't understand my words, but you must choose
(Baby gurgling)
So... come boy, choose life or death

The only man a ho wait for
Is the sky-blue Bally kid, in '83 rocked Tale Lords
My Memorex performed tape decks, my own phone sex
Watch out for Haiti bitches, I heard they throw hex
Yo, Wu whole platoon is filled with raccoons
Corner-sitting wine niggas sipping Apple Boone
This ain't no white cartoon
'Cause I be ducking crazy spades
The kid hold white shit like blacks rock ashy legs
Why is the sky blue? Why is water wet?
Why did Judas rat to Romans while Jesus slept?
Stand up, you're out of luck like two dogs stuck
Ironman be sipping rum, out of Stanley Cups, unflammable
Noriega, aiming nozzles stay windy in Chicago
Spine-tingle, mind boggles
Kangols in rainbow colors, promoters try to hold dough
Give me mine before Po wrap you up in so-and-so
I ran the Dark Ages, Constantine the Great, Henry the 8th
Built with Genghis Khan, the red suede Wally Don

I judge wisely as if nothing ever surprise me
Lounging between two pillars of ivory
I'm lively, my dome piece is like building stones in Greece
Our poems are deep, from ancient thrones I speak
I'm overwhelmed as my mind roams the realm
My eye's the visions, memory is the film
Others act sub-tile, but they fragile above cloud
They act wild and couldn't budge a crowd
No matter how loud they get, though they growl and spit
Clutch they fists and throw up signs like a Crip
And throw all types of fit
I leave them split like ass cheeks and ragged pussy lips

Aiyo, camouflage chameleon, ninjas scaling your building
No time to grab the gun, they already got your wife and children
A hit was sent from the President to raid your residence
Because you had secret evidence and documents
On how they raped the continents and lynched the prominent
Dominant Islamic, Asiatic black Hebrew
The year 2002 the battle's filled with the Wu
Six million devils just died from the Bubonic Flu
Or the Ebola virus, under the reign of King Cyrus
You can see the weakness of a man right through his iris
Unloyal snakes get thrown in boiling lakes of hot oil
Up boils your skin, chickenheads getting slim like Olive Oyl
Only plant the seed deep inside fertile soil
Fortified with essential vitamin and minerals
Use the sky for a blanket, stuffing clouds inside my pillow
Rolling with the Lamb, Twelve Tribes a 144,000 chosen
Protons Electrons Always Cause Explosions

The banks a G, all CREAM downs a bet
Money feed good, opposites off the set
It ain't hard to see my seeds need God-degree
I got mouths to feed, unnecessary beef is more cows to breed
I'm on some tax-free shit by any means
Whether bounty-hit scheme or some counterfeit CREAM
I learned much from such swift cons who run scams
Veterans got the game spiced like ham
And from that, sons are born and guns are drawn
Clips are fully loaded and then blood floods the lawn
Disciplinary action was a fraction of strength
That made me truncate the length one-tenth
Woofers thump, tweeters hiss like air pumps
RZA shaved the track, niggas caught razor bumps
Scarred trying to figure who invented
This unprecedented, opium-scented, dark-tinted
Now watch me blow him out his shoes without clues
'Cause I won't hesitate to detonate, I'm short fused",https://genius.com/Gza-4th-chamber-lyrics
Shadowboxin’,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"Special technique-
 fuck that
Spe- Special technique of shadowboxing
Goddamn, the GZA, Goddamn
The GZA, Goddamn, pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Method, Goddamn, I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Maximillion, Maximillion
Johnny Blaze
I pledge allegiance to the Hip Hop
Johnny Blaze
Maximillion, Maximillion

I breaks it down to the bone gristle
Ill speaking scud missile heat seeking
Johnny Blazing, nightmares like Wes Craven
Niggas gunning, my third eye seen it coming before it happen
You know about them fucking Staten kids, they smashing
Everything huh in any shape form or fashion
Now everybody talking bout they blasting, hmmm
Is you busting steel or is you flashing? Hmmm
Talking out your asshole
You should have learnt about the flow and peasy afro
Ticallion stallion, chinky-eye and snot-nosed
From my naps to the bunion on my big toe
I keeps it moving, know just what the fuck I'm doing
Rap insomniac, fiend to catch a nigga snoozing
Slip the cardiac arrest me, exorcist Hip Hop possess me
Crunch a nigga like a Nestle, you know my STEEZ
Burning to the third degree, sneaky ass alley cat top pedigree
The head toucher, industry party bum rusher
You don’t like it? Dick up in you, fuck ya!

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
That's right, you corny-ass rap motherfuckers
The special technique of shadowboxing
Better go back and check your fucking stacks
Shadowboxing, cause your naps ain't nappy enough
And your beats ain't rugged enough, bitch

I slayed MCs back in the rec room era
My style broke motherfucking backs like Ken Patera
Most rap niggas came loud but unheard
Once I pulled out, round 'em off to the nearest third
Check these non-visual niggas, with tapes and a portrait
Flood the seminar trying to orbit this corporate
Industry, but what them niggas can't see
Must break through like the Wu, unexpectedly
Protect Ya Neck,
 
my sword still remains imperial
Before I blast the mic, RZA scratch off the serial
We reign all year round from June to June
While niggas bite immediately if not soon
Set the lynching and form the execution date
As this two thousand beyond slang suffocate
Amplify sample through vacuum tubes compressions
Cause RZA to charge niggas twenty Gs a session

When my mind start to clicking and the strategy
Is mastered the plot thicken, this be that Wu shit
I don't give a cotton-pickin' fuck
About a brother tryna size a nigga up, I hold my own
Hard-hat protect your dome
Look at Mama baby boy acting like he grown
No time for sleep, I gets deep as a baritone
Killa bee, that be holding down his honeycomb, lounging son
Wu brother number one, protect your neck
Flying guillotines here they come, bloody bastards
Hard times and killer tactics, spitting words plus
Semi-automatic slurs, peep the graphic
Novel from the genie bottle
, hit the clutch
Shift the gear now, full throttle, time to bungee
To the next episode, I keeps it grungy
Hand on my nut sack and spitting lunghies
At a wack nigga dat, don't understand the fact
When it come to RZA tracks I don't know how to act
Real rap from the Stat, Killa Hill Projects
How to be exact, break it down
All in together now
Things are getting good looking better now
...And some other shit

Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
Sha-shadowboxing, the special technique of shadowboxing

Duel of the Iron Mic,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"Oh, mad one, we see your trap
You can never escape your fate
Submit with honor to a duel with my son
I agree
I see you're using an old style
I wondered where you'd learned it from
You know very well, it's yours too
Heh, I had forgotten, will you show me?
And what have you come for?
You come here, since you're so interested - fight me

Yo, picture bloodbaths in elevator shafts
Like these murderous rhymes tight from genuine craft
Check the print, it's where veterans spark the letterings
Slow-moving MCs is waiting for the editing
The liquid soluble that made up the chemistry
A gaseous element, that burned down your ministry
Herbal vapors and biblical papers
Smoking Exodus, every square yard is plush
Fuck the screw-faced photo sessions, facial expression
Leaves impression, try to keep a shark nigga guessing
Give crazy shouts, son, here's the outcome
Cut across the semi-gloss rhymes you floss
Shit is outdated, just like neckloads of Sterlings
Suede-fronts, bell-bottoms, and tri-colored Shearlings
I ain't particular, I bang like vehicular homicides
On July 4th, from Bed-Stuy
Where money don't grow on trees and there's thieving MC's
Who cut-throat to rake leaves
They can't breathe, blood splash, rushing fast
Like running rivers, I be that whiskey in your liver

Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

This is not a '85 affair made clear
When the Gods get on to perform storms blew up
Wu's up, causing the crowd to self-destruct
Killer Beez are stinging something while I reveal
Science that's heavily guarded by the culprit
Bombing your barracks with aerodynamic
Swordplay, poison darts by the doorway
Minds that's laced with explosive doses
Damaging lyrical launcher
Lunge at the youthful offender then injure
Any contender, testing the murderous Master
Could lead to disaster, dynamite thoughts
Explode through your barrier, rips the retina
Who can withstand the astonishing punishing
Stings to the sternum,
 
shocked in the Hip Hop livestock
Seeking for a serum to cure 'em

Adults kill for drugs plus the young bucks bust
Ducking handcuffs, throats get cut when dough rush
Out of town foes look shook but still pose
We move like real pros through the streets we stroll
Bullet holes lace the windows in one-six-oh
So control the avenues that's the dream that's sold
Building lobbies are graveyards for small-timers
Bitches caught in airports, Ki's in they vaginas
No peace, yo the police mad corrupt
You get bagged up, depending if you're passing the cut
Plus shorty's not a shorty no more, he's living heartless
Regardless of the charges, claims to be the hardest
Individual, critical thoughts, criminal minded
Blinded by illusion, finding it confusing

Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!
Duel of the Iron Mic!
It's the fifty-two fatal strikes!

Huh, Master, he must be dreaming, heh
Well, if he is dreaming then he must be asleep
And if he's asleep, then I will wake him up!
At the height of their fame and glory, they turned on one another
Each struggling in vain for ultimate supremacy
In the passion and depth of their struggle
The very art that had raised them to such Olympian heights was lost
Their techniques vanished",https://genius.com/Gza-duel-of-the-iron-mic-lyrics
Cold World,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"“I had a bad dream”
“Don’t be afraid, bad dreams are only dreams”
“What a time you chose to be born in”

Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

It was the night before New Year’s
And all through the fucking projects
Not a handgun was silent, not even a TEC
Outsiders were stuck, by enemies who put fear
And blasted on the spot before the pigs were there
You know hoods, robbers, snipers new in sight
Fuck blue and white
They escape before them flash the fucking lights
Gunshots, shatter first-floor window panes
Shells hit the ground and blood stained the dice game
Whether pro-calisthenic, any style you set it
Beat niggas toothless, physically cut up like gooses
But with iron on the sides, thugs took no excuses
Therefore, your fifty-two handblocks was useless
Links was snatched off necks, left scars on throats
Jackets took, after bullet rips through coats
Against those who felt the cold from the steel made ‘em fold
And squeal, once the metal hit the temple of his grill
Construction worker, who was caught for his bomber
No time to swing the hammer that was hanging from his farmers
And it’s bugged how some niggas catch slugs
And pockets dug from everything except check stubs
And it does, sound ill like wars in Brownsville
Or fatal robberies in Red Hook where feds look
For fugitives to shoot cops, niggas laying on roof tops
For his cream he stashed in a shoebox
But he was hot, and the strip was filled with young killers
You don’t suspect, so cops creep like caterpillars
And born thieves stay hooded with extra bullets
Those who try to flee they hit the vertebrae
Increase the murder rate
Similar to hitmen who pull out TECs and then
Drop those who crack like tacos from Mexican
Rapid, like recipients cashing checks again
Back to the motherfucking spot on Lexington

Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world

Yo; no time to freeze, undercovers ease up in Grand Prixs
And seize packages and pocket the currency
Cliques control strips full clips are sprayed
Yellow tape barricades sidewalks where bodies lay
Madness strikes at twelve o’clock midnight
Stick-up kids on the ground broke the staircase light
And I stays harassed, scrambling for petty cash
Jakes on my ass young bucks is learning fast
Three-Fifteen-Sevens and Forty-Fours
Bought inside corner stores, provide sparks for wars
Hospital floors surrounded by the law
Homicide questioning while the Jakes guard the door
My hood stay tense, loyalty puts strength in my team
‘Cause niggas’ main concern is C.R.E.A.M
Some niggas in the jet-black Galant
Shot up the Chinese restaurant, for this kid named Lamont
I thought he was dead but instead he missed the kid
And hit a twelve-year-old girl in the head, and then fled
Tactical narcotic task force, back off fast
‘Cause the crime boss is passing off cash
Extortions for portions of streets, causes beef
Having followers of Indians trying to play Chief
You witness the saga, casualties and drama
Life is a script; I’m not an actor but the author
Of a modern-day opera, where the main character
Is presidential papers, the dominant factor

You know, you had me
With your sensuous charm
But you looked so alarmed
As I walked on by

Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
Babies crying, brothers dying, and brothers getting knocked
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world
We be running from the cops, busting off shots
Shit is deep on the block and you got me locked down
In this cold, cold world",https://genius.com/Gza-cold-world-lyrics
Living In The World Today,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"Yo yeah, check it out, son, check it out, son
Yo Wu, can I get a soo?, live in the place to be
You got the capital G, Z to the A, MC
Givin' a mad shout out to the Ranch Crew, from the old school
And we gonna take y'all back, know what I'm sayin'?
Lyrical sorcerers right here, the fathers, the cream of the crop, son
Yo, check it

Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sound, then clap, man
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it

My rhyme gross weight vehicle combination
Was too heavy for the Chevy's, is chased out the station
Double-edged was the guillotine that beheaded it
Gassed up, fuckin' with some regular unleaded shit
Heads roll on hillsides behind ropes that bind-in
X marks the spot on the scope
Heavily armed, military is necessary, it's a gamble
MCs bet they best at every
Powerful parable ditties might harm
If tampered with, set off and strike like pipe bombs
Flashbacks to the ""Duel of the Iron Mic""
Look out for these fatal flying spikes, so massive
Sleep-holds, put strangle on commercial angle
Microphone cords tangled from being Star Spangled
Now, who could ever say they heard of this?
My motherfuckin' style is mad murderous

Well, if you like the way it sound then clap man (clap man)
And if the bitches love it too well then raise your hands (Come on)
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, yeah
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't have them (Have them)
So we blast 'em, (Blaow!) alright, well okay

Well, what you know about MCin'?
Yo, I know a lot
Well, can you demonstrate somethin', nigga?
Huh, I'd rather not
I'm talkin 'bout stacks, cousin
Nigga, that's what I got
Cash Rules the world
Well, Cash Rules the spot

My preliminary attack keep cemeteries packed
Of niggas who think it ain't like that
MCs are gunned down like being run down with mad trucks
Then, God struck, religious niggas call it ""bad luck""
Rap celeb, you got caught up in the web
Now, bees are stingin', yo, that niggas em-singin'
I'm just swingin' swords strictly based on keyboards
Unbalanced like elephants and ants on see-saws
I throw raps that attack like the Japs on Pearl Harbor
MCs be out like bank robbers
Fleeing the scene, to be a sole survivor
DJ, the getaway driver
Tried to dip, but he dive, I socialize on vocal vibes
On tracks stabbed up with razor-sharp knives
Criminal subliminal minded rappers find it
Hard to define it, when narrow is the gate
For fat tapes and then played out and out of date
Then I construct my thoughts on site to renovate
And from that point, the God made a statement
Draftin' tracements, replacements in basements
Materials in sheet-rock to sound proof the beatbox
And microscopic optics received through the boxes
Obnoxious topic, major labels, flavor tropical
Punchlines, that's unstoppable
Ring like shots from Glocks that attract cops
Around the clubs and try to shut down the hip-hop
But we only increase if everything is peace
Father You See King the police

Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em (Have them)
So we blast 'em (blaow), alright, well, ok
Well, if you like the way it sounds, then clap, man (Clap, man)
And if the women love it too, well, then raise your hands (Uh huh, come on)
But only raise your hands if you're sure
Punk niggas shatter like a glass jaw, break it
Well, if you livin' in the world today
You be hearin' the slang that the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front, we don't have 'em (Have them)
So we blast 'em, alright, well, ok

The Wu-Tang say
We don't handle 'em, alright, well okay
The world today, the Wu-Tang say
Niggas that front we don't handle 'em
So we blast 'em, alright, well ok",https://genius.com/Gza-living-in-the-world-today-lyrics

That be getting misinformed, thinking everything is everything
You could just get yourself a little deal, whatever
You know what I'm saying
You gonna get on, you gonna get rich
And all these labels be trying to lure us in like spiders
Into the web, you know what I'm saying
So sometimes people gotta come out and speak up
And let people understand
That you know you gotta read the label
You gotta read the label
If you don't read the Label you might get poisoned

Bomb these niggas God!

Tommy ain't my motherfuckin' boy
When you fake moves on a nigga you employ
We'll all emerge off your set, now you know God damn
I show living large niggas how to flip a Def Jam
And Ruff up the motherfuckin' House 'cause I smother
You Cold Chillin' motherfuckers, I still Warner Brother
I'm Ruthless my clan don't have to act wild
That shit is Jive, an old Sleeping Bag Profile
The soft comedian rap shit ain't the rough witty
On the reel to reel it wasn't from a Tuff City
Niggas be game, thinking that they lyrical surgeons
They know they mic's a phone to Virgin
And if you ain't boned a mic you couldn't hurt a bee
That's like going to Venus driving a Mercury
The Capitol of this rugged slang is Wu-Tang
Witty unpredictable talent and natural game
I Death Row an MC with mic cables
The Epic is that I Rush Associated Labels
From East, West to ATCO, I bring it to a Next Plateau
But I keep it phat though, yo
I'm hitting batters up with the Wild Pitch style
I even show an Uptown MCA style
Who thought he saw me on 4th & Broadway
But I was out on the Island, bombing MC's all day
My Priority is that I'm First Priority
I bone the secret out a bitch in a sorority
So look out for A&M, the Abbot and the Master
Breaking down your Pendulum
As I fiend MC's out with a blow that'll numb the a-
-ppendix, I'm holding more weight than Columbia
Index Interscope, we RCA, clan
That's coming with a plan to free a
Slave of a mental death MC don't panic
Throw that A&R nigga off the boat in the Atlantic
Now who's the Bad Boy character, not from Arista
But firing weapons released on Geffen
So duck as I struck with the soul of Motown
My central broadcasting systems is low down
And dirty, like that bastard
It's getting drastic

Read the label and say it loud
Another Wu banger
Thirty-six chambers, through your area

Gold,Liquid Swords,1995.0,"Aiyo shorty, yo that's my word
Oh, y'all smelling y'all piss now y'all think y'all gold
Yo anybody get caught flinging over here
I'm returning 'em, that's my word they getting blasted
Anything from 220 to 140, that's mine
Y'all need to step the fuck off
Y'all niggas ain't crazy for real

Yo, the fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

I'm deep down in the back streets, in the heart of Medina
About to set off something more deep than a misdemeanor
Under the subway, waiting for the train to make noise
So I can blast a nigga and his boys, for what?
He pushed up on the block and made the dope sales drop
Like the crash in the Dow Jones stock
I had a connect to cross-sales, to catch more mill's
Than ho-bitches got birth control pills
I'm in the park setting up a deal over blunt fire
Bum nigga sleeping on the bench, they had him wired
Peeped my convo, the address of my condo
And how I changed a nigga name to John Doe
And while we set up camp, we got vamped
Put the stake through his heart, I ripped his fucking fangs apart
Snake got smoked on the set like Brandon Lee
Blown out the frame like Pan Am Flight 103
He got swung on, his lungs was torn
A kingpin just castled with his rook and lost a pawn
A regular on the block that played lookout
For preying predator with a Glock, he should have took out

No neighbourhood is rough enough
There is no clip that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you

It's mandatory that I supply all my troops with mega firearms
Big apes and spread 'em out like crops on a farm
To get cream
, 
sometimes they repaint the scene
Like the last episode on gates,
 and other niggas
Plant bombs till the smoke from the blast becomes thick
And flows through, all they knew, he's gun sick
His Glock clicks like high-heeled shoes on parquet floors
Mad sick, stand on hills and invade wars
Filthy foul, shovelling dirt, he's out to hurt
For instance, chop off hands, attack worth
His idols would lock down airports and extort
Some import, catching ten percent of what the fiends snort
Up in the ski resorts, up in hills
They move keys and had the skis making drops on snowmobiles
The plan was to expand, catch seven figures, release triggers
And live large and bigger than my nigga
Who promised his moms a mansion with mad room
She died and he still put a hundred grand in her tomb
Open wounds, he hid behind closed doors
And still organizes crime and drug wars

Fiends ain't coming fast enough
There is no cut that's pure enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
No neighborhood is rough enough
There is no clips that's full enough
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you
There's no cuffs that's tight enough
There is no niggas that's fuck with us
I can't fold, I need gold, I re-up and reload
Product must be sold to you",https://genius.com/Gza-gold-lyrics

Killah hills 10304

Restaurant's on a stakeout, so order the food to take out
Chaos outside of Sparks Steak House
Maintain the power, I feel the deal's gone sour
Nigga missed a wedding, late a fucking half-hour
And his man who bought land from Tony Starks
While he was contracting bricklaying jobs in city parks
He's a loan shark, interest raise a grand to a finger
In the garment district, 
got it sewn like Singers
'Cause all that talk blasphemy, this kid after me
For the heist, in a Burlington coat factory
Fuck it, he turned state's on my nigga, Castro, this copilot
Who used to drop rice sacks of blow
On this remote area we label Dead Man's Island
Two hundred miles South from Thailand
Right off the docks, I got luxurious, custom-made yachts
Burial plots, for my niggas hit with fatal shots
There's no need for us to spray up the scene
I use less men, more powerful shit for my team
Like my man, Muhammad, from Afghanistan, grew up in Iran
The nigga runs a neighborhood newsstand
A wild Middle Eastern—bomb specialist
Initiated at eleven to be a terrorist
He set bombs in bottles of champagne
And when niggas popped the cork—niggas lost half they brains
Like this ex-worker, tried to smuggle a half-a-key
In his left leg, even underwent surgery
They say his pirate limp gave him away
As the feds rushed him, coming through U.S. Customs
Now look whose on the witness stand, singing, a well known soprano
A smash hit from Sammy Gravano
Here's the plan minimum for the hit, two hundred grand
Half time at the game, blasting niggas out the stands
The sharp-shooters hit the prosecutor, judges are sent
Photographs of they wives taking baths
Along with briefcase filled with one point five—that's the bribe
Take it or commit suicide
First rule—anyone who schemes on the gold in Syria
I want they small intestines ripped from they interior
I got a price for those jewels, ship 'em freight cargo
Don't forget to launder the cream through Wells Fargo
Reconstruct those processing plants for the call of Costa Rica
Four hundred barrels of ether
Two hundred pounds of reefer, and fifty immigrants with fake Visas

Mix collaboration man, little man and his girl
Way of life got me thinking, plus I'm analyzing young
Youths on roofs, you know, three time felony brutes
Roll together, tropical trees puff, whatever
Yo we could go run up on, kids for leathers
What drug? Faculties bubble keys for G's
Cream flow like seven seas, hit chicks Guyanese
Word up, hold your head before you fall out
The morgue route, the devil want that
Let's get my niggas locked all out
Change for better, that be my only vendetta
With life, feed your seed right, he's breathing indeed right

Never get jacked,

Paradise trife, plush with much ice
Getting nice, laying back, sleep all my life; word up!

Crack patients, dime smokers
Vial carriers, mocha tokers
Burnt buildings, brothers building
Save the children, investigative reports!

Calling all cars, calling all cars! Ghetto
Psychos, armed and dangerous, leaving mad scars
On those who are found bound, gagged and shot
When they blast the spot, victims took off like astronauts
Get with this, even your best can't
Come on down, you're the next contestant!
Get your pockets dug from all your Chemical Bank ends
Caught him at the red light – on
 
Putnam Avenue and Franklin
They used to heat up the cipher with a shot that was hyper
Than your average JFK sniper
He just came home from Spofford
Rolling like Kaufman, and laid that ass out like carpet
Stop the stuttering boy, save complaints for the 
five-oh
Then praise the God – chk-a-chk POW!
They release shots and premeditate to grab
And then they jet back to the lab
And then remain in 
Shaolin
, an endangered island
Where shorties lose blood by the gallons

Yo, I grab the pen for revenge and let loose, see
Like Muslims, standing on the block, rocking a kufi
The hundred-dollar kick rocking kid's back for more
Starting gun wars, with black Reeboks and Velours
Jungle way of life, living villain
Packed with visions, copywritten
Throwing bread to pigeons, Christ has risen
King Elegant, slang master, jack expensive noodle hats
In sixty-nine, old timers time that brothers shot craps
The baggy blue Guess jeans, pull strings off in Palm Springs
I'm locked in the bing, Rocky ring labelled rap king
The corner emperor – the golden thieves play the benches
Rednecks be hanging big niggas down in Memphis
Back in Now-Y, hit the bull's eye with loaded nines
Life is like Tarzan, swinging from a thin vine
Shatter dreams, then mirrors don't need a press spirals
Aim at the white shadows with big barrels
Of Moet-ers, the bald headers, milk and Armarettas
Who fear none, crushing all personal vendettas, yo
They use guns while we angrily shot arrows
You better keep your eye on the sparrow

Motherfuckers think they qualify

Yo, I'm not caught up in politics
I'm no black activist on a so-called scholar's dick
I come through with the Wu and drop math
And versatile freestyle bombs and phonographs
And deliver, all things in number and weight
Searched to death, on how living things relate
Cause at a young age, I was molded in a religion I relied on
And got caught up in superstition
Scared to split pole, ducked black cats
Once in a while, threw salt over my back
But with knowledge of self from off the shelf
Made things seemed complicated now small like elves
So turn off the lights, light a candle, and have a seance
Pull the lid off the Dean Martin scandal
Witches, warlocks, spooks and holy ghosts
RZA let's defraud the hoax

When a motherfucker steps out his place

I had to pull your card, you was on the top deck
So I plotted my escape, I saw the thin line between love and hate
And fast from the hog on the plate
I suffered brutal pain, from whips and chains
Punishments that were set to wash the brain
So look listen observe and also respect this jewel
Drawed up, detect and reflect this
Light I shine, 
because my powers is refined
Through the truth, which manifest through eternal minds
Purified gases and masses the same elements
That helped spark civilization classes
I see brothers quote math plus degrees
Lip professin' ass niggas can't feed they own seeds

Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)

I was always taught my do's and don'ts
For do's I did, and for don'ts, I said I won't
I'm from Brooklyn, a place where stars are born
Streets are shot up, apartment buildings are torn
And ripped up, stripped up, shacked up and backed up
From fiends, cause the bosses on the scene, they got it cracked up
Kids are slinging in my lobby
Little Steve and Bobby
Getting paid but it's a life-threatening hobby
Yeah, they still play hide-and-seek
The fiends seek for the crack, and they hide and let the cops peep
Grown folks say they should be out on their own
Before the gangs come and blow up their mom's home
Because they lifestyle is hectic, so fucking hectic
Blaow! Blaow! Blaow! Bullets are ejected
My lifestyle was so far from well
Could've wrote a book with a title ""Age 12 and Going Through Hell""
Then I realized the plan
I'm trapped in a deadly video game, with just one man
So I don't only watch my back, I watch my front
Cause it's the niggas who front, they be pulling stunts
Back on the Ave of Livonia and Bristol with a pistol
Sticking up Pamela and Crystal
You know your town is dangerous when you see the strangest
Kid come home from doing the bid and nothing changes
What is the meaning of CRIME (what?)
Is it Criminals Robbing Innocent Motherfuckers Everytime?
Little shorties take walks to the schoolyard
Trying to solve the puzzles to why is life so hard
Then as soon as they reached the playground, blaow!
Shots ring off and now one of them lay down
It's so hard to escape the gunfire
I wish I could rule it out like an umpire
But it's an everlasting game, and it never cease to exist
Only the players change, so

I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas that front, they be pulling stunts
I gotcha back, but you best to watch your front
Cause it's the niggas who front (they be pulling stunts)

Smash whatever you throw, 1000 is what I'm battin'

Took them out your corn dog books and notepads
I get it, you Got Rich robbing those in the industry
Bite off this one, steal from your enemy
Never try to play the hottest one out your camp
He might step off and take half the juice from your amp
Enough to make you vogue on the cover of GQ
Only missing the sheer blouse, homie, you see-through
Stop sipping on that Formula 50
They want heat, I'll give it to them burnt and crispy
Rhymes too short to box with God, so stretch it
Especially these overrated rap steppin' fetchers
I told you if I rain, there'll be an eternal drizzle
Woodwork strips being chipped to charred chisel
One verse shatter your spine and crush your spirit
No matter what, you still window shop for lyrics
If you's a pimp, put chicks on a stroll
And if those your soldiers, give 'em bigger guns to hold

Move like a Fed, talk like a mobster
That Yayo slangin, please abort it

Spray the Flea-Unit with pesticides
You can get your best ghostwriters, get them all to testify
Have you ever been stung by a thousand hornets?
Five hundred killa bees, buzzing and really on it
Whipped with Cuban Linx, cut with Liquid Swords
Choked by Ironman 'til we crush your vocal cords
You ain't nothing but a pig in a blanket
Hoghead, the deadliest food at the banquet
All this rap crap that's trapped in your colon
Only means, get rid of the whack shit you're holdin'
Sweet-tooth dudes stay out the candyshop
You ain't gotta handcuff 'em to see the panties drop
A few cats is looking for a rat with cheese
Got something to pitch? They all swing a bat with ease
Get your ankles rolled while doing your two-step
Leave a Thank-You note for the crutches the Wu left
Proactive rap, you know they put drug in the cream
You hallucinate, see Kanye in your dream
And yo, I don't smoke dust; I dust off Smokey and the Bandits
With the brush stroke off the canvas
I walk on your Gators and lizards
Raise the lynx that was killed for your minx, you be rocking them Blizzards
Wanna be caught 'til you walk the D-Block
To get a transfer, I'll spread your wings like Peacocks
I was an emcee while you was in Nutville
On a world tour, you was gettin' your guts filled

Beneath the Surface,Beneath the Surface,1999.0,"On a man-made lake there's a sheet of thin ice
Where unskilled skaters couldn't figure-8 twice
That's sixteen uncut direct from the cult
Head on assault, the result death by the bolt
In a vault, they spoke about the average loss per mission
That was seen by a king in a prophetic vision
Like a plane crash from a bomb blast
Special broadcast, slot time with comcast
They kept the jury quiet and now the riot will form
While satanic man now hang in his dorm
I swing on you fake radio personalities
Who boost ya ratings with hypes behind casualties
And fire shots with low-pressure water gun play
But instantly slap ya five like it's Palm Sunday
I fashion the first tool, from the elements the Earth use
And built it to a complex network of communications
You're up against a hopeless situation
I screen every vehicle from enemy observation
Swarming unpredictably, we spread terror
Increase the fog significantly, change the era
Check my wind pattern, it's heading west
Success is freedom but failure can mean death
Humans sweat and aim shovels, dig up the debris and rubble
Permanent damage caused by the W
Now who cowardlessly urge you to merge through
And think the workers will serve you?
The sonic marvel who just dropped the next novel
Worldwide, rapidly marred in marble
It's a countless amount of emcees I saved
And them same niggas wanna squander those gifts I gave

Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fate's erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

Love and hatred, moments most sacred
Both species, they lay naked in the tombs of oasis
Think back on niggas I ate with, spent the day with
Guns we played with, niggas I relate with
We broke bread, I heard through a vine niggas worked for the Fed
Sent out secretly to take my head
I laid back and meditate to the words they said
Skipped town for a month and grew some dreads
Had a friend tell my family I was dead
Returned at the last fall of the autumn leaf
Operate the plan accordingly in case the Feds are recording me
Sign all documents using forgery cause just a mere thought of me
I'm like Solomon, spoke bluntly, told the world, ""I'm black and comely""
Howls from the grave haunt me, the smell of death's upon me
I dwell in the Hills like Gandhi
Been in the presence of mad peasants and old kings
Who sold everything on a quest for God's Divine
Slept in caves to get a clear mind
Who prayed three times, when the Moon lit and when the Sun rise
I met dwellers in the desert, talked to shepherds
Been in the mouth of many leopards
Felt the death kiss of Satan's mistress
Walk through vacant districts, before religions I studied pagan scriptures
True philosophers and physicians on the cure missions
Who harden their hearts toward the weak, sick and inflicted
Candles lit, gamble with a bitch
Who made me love her when I touch her
Soft paws hide claws
Bees with sweet honey in they mouth
Have bitter stingers at they tail
Walk through the chambers of death, take a hole onto Hell
Embracing her was like embracing the third rail

Scratch underneath the surface, where does your purpose lie?
It seems our will is worthless, like we're pawns beneath the sky
Fate's erased by reason and passion's just a whim
Feel empty so I breath in, keep myself from giving in

The Spark,Dark Matter,2016.0,"From the mind, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
There was enormous energy - it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space
Special place with information encased
One of infinite beginnings this cosmic clock was ticking
And allowed space to float while it was spinning
All that you see around us
Sun, the Moon and stars - millions of worlds that astound us
The universe in size is hard to fathom
When composed in a region small as a single atom
One billionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic, on a macro level within
And unfurled the swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy, with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanded beyond comprehension
Then a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size but very unstable
In time it would come with the periodic table
Space was expanding faster than light speed
Moving at the speed only thought can exceed
A picosecond after The Big Bang, music of the spheres
Before the ears, the universes now sang
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of the second later - 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since its time of birth

Step into a world of black holes, quasars
Galaxies, supernovas, bright stars
A spectrum of light beams
Images beyond your wildest dreams

Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was spinning within the batter
But mass and energy are interchangeable
Convert those particles, not to name a few
Matter and antimatter, the arch-rival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there's life and breath there's one remaining left
But an imbalance caused particles to vibrate
Away from the galactic center at high rates
So fast becoming a liquid
And it would be 300,000 years before it dripped it
Despite being perfect, it was in turmoil
Then it would fall back under pressure, recoil
Subatomic particles smashed into each other
Continuous energy years before discovered
Then it slowed down and began to bond
Creating atoms - building blocks of matter and beyond
It was now eight times the size of the solar system
Distance, thorough measurements, I enlist them
Sixty billion miles in diameter
Temperature of seventeen trillion Fahrenheit to damage ya
And it was only a millionth of a second old
And it would be another million years before turning cold

Step into a world of black holes, quasars
Galaxies, supernovas, bright stars
A spectrum of light beams

Science Genius 12.12.12 Speech,Science Genius: A Legend Begins,2012.0,"Teachers College, Columbia University
12/12/12
Thank you for your introduction, Chris. Thank you David, Helen, Daniel, Ridhi and John for coming to support our effort. And thank you everyone, for coming. My name is GZA from The Wu Tang Clan. It is an honor to be here at Teachers College to discuss Science Genius. Particularly on 12/12/12. Since 2001, I have done something to commemorate the triple number date. But I can't think of a better way to culminate the tradition than to be here with all of you to talk about this program
Most people associate Wu Tang with Staten Island but I was born in Brooklyn and lived in almost every borough by the time I was ten. I left high school in the tenth grade and it's one of my greatest regrets in life. I am here--not as a teacher, nor expert, nor genius--but rather as a science enthusiast who wants to inspire New York City public high school students to get excited about biology, chemistry and physics. I wish there had been a more compelling way to captivate my imagination about science when I was in school
The interaction between matter and energy has always aroused my interest and curiosity. When I was around the age of six, I can remember playing with two pieces of steel or metal. One of them was magnetic and the other was not. The piece with the magnetic force attracted the piece without. I flipped them in opposite directions and they repelled each other as if some force was pushing them apart. I found this fascinating. Years later I would come to learn that every single atom in your body is from the core of a star that was created billions of years ago. From the skin cells to the iron in your blood, the carbon in your genes to the gold on your finger, all created over thirteen billion years ago. Not only is that an interesting connection, it is also a great one. This is a very unique bond that makes you look at life in a whole different perspective and see beauty in everything
In the last year I was able to meet with some of the top scientists in the world, including those whom you've just heard from. At MIT I met with Biological Oceanographer Penny Chisholm, Geneticist Eric Lander, the founding director of The Broad Institute at MIT. At Cornell University I met Alexander Gaeta and last but not least, Neil DeGrasse Tyson. It was incredibly humbling and inspiring to meet with these people but I do believe that the future Penny's, David's and Neil's are the young students that are in the NYC public schools. Not only was it interesting to see how dedicated and committed they were to their work, it was also interesting to see how excited they were to hear that I was incorporating science into my works
My next album will be entitled DARK MATTER, which is scheduled to be released in 2013. It will be a Cosmic journey through the universe. A galactic adventure. A Personal look into a dark and distant past. Matter that influences the evolution of the universe gravitationally. The goal is to influence the evolution of hip hop and schooling
Now that hip hop has become the single most dominant cultural touchstone in the lives of most youth, Chris Edmin, Rapgenius and I have come together to sponsor Science Genius. We chose hip hop as an art form to educate the listeners about scientific topics. As I said before I am not a science teacher. I go into classrooms as an artist and provide a model for students to communicate the information learned from their science teachers
My role in the process is to encourage students to compose creative writing, not just through rhyme, but through a metaphoric narrative approach to animate the science concepts so that the material can be digested by students in a interdisciplinary way. The rhymes are a starting point to introduce this technique of seeing science in a new way, a new context. I challenge students to not be too literal and write compelling stories. Make it ""half short, twice strong."" Light as an atom to where it doesn't trouble the soul of the listener, but heavy as a neutron star to where it's mind boggling
One thing that I try to impart in the classroom is that the rhyme must be clear, eloquent, witty and clever. I challenge students to make sense of complex information while maintaining the high standards of serious lyricism
I believe that science is important because it helps you gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your surroundings. Knowledge of one's environment specifically through science can increase self-awareness, confidence, and critical thinking skills that can translate outside of the classroom. I just heard on a commercial that “Children need to learn science in order to succeed in this global society.” Hip hop is important because using a vehicle the students are already familiar with decreases their resistance to the technical jargon in science, giving them more control over their communication while incorporating science concepts into their everyday vocabularies

Pencil,Pro Tools,2008.0,"The echo chamber enhance the flow with the block party
Keep an MC head spinning like Dark Bacardi
This B.A.C. is 2.3
Now the liver's damaged, but his lungs are joint free
So inhale, exhale, breathe and get well
Kick something live stop chirping like Nextel
I'm All In Together, a swordsman forever
I paint the town red, with many heads are severed
R-A-W, I still bring trouble to
Throw your raps in the sleephold, quick to smother you
Dart hit your breastplate, meet ya death date
Rook down a E4, look, it's checkmate
No other way describe it but catastrophe
The plan was drawing blood and displayed it graphically
Direct order, hit the border, then slaughter
Horrific torture, by prolific authors
Shape and mold MC's, like I'm playing the skelly top
It's getting 'hot in here' like the single that Nelly dropped
So take ya clothes off, the track is so soft
A little vodka turn 'em into Ivan Koloff
Why do the Gods make MC's study from
Thirty five, and fifty year, then try to become
Under the study with the sword above the head
So he would keep in mind under the open pledge

Fierce glisten, something so sharp
Piercing, swords cling, the vigilante intimate
Close combat, this is emceeing at its best
But there is no contest, sent I'm this
Speaking of a test, this and try to question this
He so different with the swiftness, godfather civilization
Shell casing, universal nation
Could he be the one predicted, presidential sent in
Old school soul survivors, we the wildest
Asiatic Arctic flow is so frigid

Is it, the Zig Zag, I'ma pay you a visit
Somehow mistake me as an old wise wizard
Word? I'm not the same
I go somewhere, don't remember how I came
Is it the weed, the hash or the 'caine?
Or the Digi being stained on my brain
Appear from a cloud of smoke, your throat is on choke
If surrounded, seven men drop from one stroke
Even if my feet was shackled down to one handcuff
To defeat me, ten demons wouldn't be enough
I sleep in the lion's den, without the steel iron
Ascended like Musa coming down from Mt. Zion
Superlogical this, superlogical that
Digital, take it back with superlogical rap
Have a shootout, at midnight, the sequel's quicker
Forty four colt jolt, all you seen was the flicker
You distress like the damsel, lost like little 'Hansel'
Your flame couldn't generate the heat of a candle
Me, I be a Killa Bee, keeping exilery
Ol' play the desert e, shoot ten millime'
Master the millipede, you try to end the sea
Your body being found in the naval yard artillery
A black blind governor, a rich white mayor
Man, this whole city ain't got a prayer
Bobby has invaded, now the whole town's slated
Your decapitated head is being tooken out paraded
Up and down the avenue, I drive a shatterproof
Benz, and all my men's are tattle proof
My mic is a dyke, my life is a light
A Day to God is a Thousand Years, how long is a night?
You get trapped in my shadow of dark, hark, who goes there?
Power-U smells like carp, don't put your nose there
Drop you to a tank of sharks, your wound's bleeding
And it's been two weeks since they had their last feeding
Any leftover bones, we grind into sand
And spread it out, over 20 acres of land
Some call me Steels, 'cause it's hard to bend me
See Cipher Pigs can't apprehend me
In a no smoking zone, I smoke bones of hash
Niggas see me, then I disappear in the flash
Next time I'm spotted, I got the fatter wallet
Moving with a clique that stick like dry porridge
Someone's been sitting in my chair, who goes there?
To sub zero cold, your words can't flow here
Glaciers of ice, plus layers of spice
Say your prayers at night, 'fore you touch that mic",https://genius.com/Gza-pencil-lyrics
Alphabets,Pro Tools,2009.0,"All I need is a beat, with a continuous loop
And a live vibe, that'll hypnotize like the flute
Along with something that's rugged by nature like the forest
Composed like the symphony without a chorus
A place with the path and trail that you follow
With the wood, where you drive your nails, but too hollow
Far from reality, with a slim chance of getting back
Even if you narrowly escape the hidden traps
Nothing but the driven raps written in my notebook
Inspired by the cap and the gown, that's on the coat hook
Prepare for the chemical rush, something new to cause
Your heart to bass, but it's tangible to touch
Associate with those who are consumed with beats
Produce fire, until they melt the room with heat
You know my ink lay all over the sheets, let us/letters gather around
And form words, every time they meet

Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality
Father, then after that, there's the G-O-D

Rule of Rulers, Self of Save, the Truth of the square, the same
Universe, Victory, Wisdom, Unknown/X, Why/Y
Zig Zag Zig, and now we're back home

I brought butter for the popcorn, dip for the chips
And ego for your trip, some scripts for you to flip
Corrections for mishaps, errors, or mistakes
Fly raps for beats, and pop and lock for breaks
A legend in my own lifetime, from one rhyme
That was specially designed, from the hook to bottom line
Shine's like a precious jewel, cut up in the workshop
With specialized handcrafted tools
Couldn't buy this hardware, so don't swipe your card there
Better yet, fold your hand, 'cause you holding the wrong pair
One hit wonders, get a little shine like flashlights
But when I drop the bomb and explode like gas pipes
A livewire, known as the dragon that spit fire
Verbal action, hot as the grease from deep fryers
Delivered in the perfect pitch, because hip hop
Is all in my genes/jeans, the pattern is seen in every stitch

Allah Be a Born, Cee Divine, Equality

Yeah, GZA, you know, uh, Rassy, you know
Shouts out to my nigga Wreckonize,
 all my MIA

Formed in very a strong advanced post, east to west coast
Ahead of time, competition not even half close
Let's say, by no means, an equal value
Prematurely brought to play,
 I'll never allow you
To strike first, so precautions must be taken
And what's worst? When you're just fronting and faking
It's a shame when the sixteen bars are just a waste
And every line or word, is badly placed
Even dealing with the narrow window of time
My arrangements are quick, shutting down your power lines
On a bunch of small puppets, with a wack ass team
That only move, at a push of a button that pull strings
Bad boys move in silence, secretly fading in
Unlike fake gangstas and ya wannabe made men
Acting like they carry the gun that killed Lincoln
Or they rolling with two hundred murderers from Kingston

Our goal is to learn y'all niggas, about this new world order
But I'm still try'nna run up in the president's daughters
He the author, ain't let the NARC's see this sparker
Stick to bitches walls like I'm Peter Parker
The Vida Guerra sidekick hacker
Five naked flicks, on the Internet jacked her
Dog, I'm not a rapper, I'm the black Dracula
Nosferatu, spitting darts at you,
 out of black Acura

I'm the Benjamin stack attractor
Mack attacker, pimp slapper, the track cracker
Epitome of nice, after 
Rainbo press the lacquer
And y'all niggas is the worst, like fat chicks with little tits

And the polar bear feasts on the blubber of seals
The pack of wolves be scheming on a bunch of gazelles
Where the leopards grab the wildebeest down by its tail
You see the chimps they grow hemps they hustle and sling in trees
Elephants for security that move tons of leaves
The bluebirds arrest parrots that love to talk
Or eagles that stalk fresh-water trout under the wing of the hawk
You see the vultures pick the pocket of whatever remain
In the brain we watch but a shadow of the lion's mane
Whose roar is loud enough to take the stripes from a zebra
He camouflage his bets and his spots of a cheetah
Shouldn't gamble with a cheetah and not expect to get beat
You silly goose you know he move fast on his feet
Now you're neck deep in debt with a bunch of loan sharks
So you move on a colony of ants with aardvarks, you see
Most of the everglades controlled by the gators
It was crashed by the crocs who came years later
See the locusts had swarmed with the bees
The tick moved with the fleas
The dragonflies and the wasps shared with the seas
The crab and the leeches sucked your blood flow
And they laugh like hyenas when they out to catch dough
See a million mosquitos from the West Nile
Carrying the virus that made the boars less wild

It's like the jungle sometimes

Out of fear, the deer watch for the eye of the tiger
The Clutch from the Cobra and the venomous viper
Boa-constrictors that cut your circulation
Mosts of their prayers die from broke bones and suffocation
The owls are private eyes that watch from the bark
Black panthers are the militant who strike in the dark
Porcupines had a rep' for sticking everything that moved
In areas that the rhinos and hippos approved
And the giraffe was a look-out for gorillas in the mist
And the bats use their sonar to guide and assist
Those pelicans who smuggle contraband for the whale
While the skunks spray the scent to keep the dogs off the trail
The scorpion set up a sting for sly foxes
That use stool pigeons just to keep them in the boxes
While the black widow
Laid a web for the bachelor
Like daddy-long-leg and his hype man, tarantula
They both prey on grasshoppers beetles and flies
And they all become instant meals the moment it dies
What costs little is of little worth
So some lose they lives wandering on the wrong turf
From birth they grow up walking the thin line

It's like the jungle sometimes",https://genius.com/Gza-animal-planet-lyrics

Fuck with the Wu, we busting ya whole snot box
Million white ears and your bitch up in a zip lock
From Spazzola to this purest form of hip-hop

Here's something to advertise, promoter keep the fans satisfied
Load data for the disc drive, ghetto citywide
Leave 'em paralyzed, they stolen every word I provide
Without no clearance, I nurture this track like I'm its parents
Got requestments from retail stores for my appearance
First we target it, then they market it to kill your artist with
My hundred sharp cartridge hit whoever's starting shit
Got as many rap soldiers for how much this record ship
Fuck them niggas you record with, I make 'em forfeit
Send a bomb rap through FedEx inside your office
Son we build and deliver, came to build with the GZA
You heard the chorus from the RZA, ain't no real album spitter
Me and my street team be holding congress meetings
Audio visual video treatments internationally speaking
Got managers scared to shop you, ready to drop you
It's the coming of that newest hip-hop, Christ's apostle
Try your BDS and SoundScans for more fam
Your whole roster couldn't take on that one Sun of Man
Get your street team, get your stickers out, put your posters up
Boost your budget up, still Razah gon' fuck it up

Feed the hungry MCs who be starving as hell
I laid the first verse to quench a dry ass nigga's thirst
Who drank my wisdom up like water till his stomach burst
Full tank with the premium quality raps
Mickey Mouse niggas get caught on a trap
You Cottonelle kid from Tottenville, you're Kleenex
Looking like Rockwell wearing V-necks
You learned from this, earned from this
Niggas get tossed and turned in this and burnt in this
Scorched at a thousand degrees from live MCs
I melt y'all niggas down to the size of fleas

Your microphonists collect the bonus, aiyo we own this
House niggas verse the homeless, ten to one
Timb's the one, Royal Famous. the verbal painters
Dark gallery, million dollar pictures
Imports from poor to riches, move darts
We cruise across the Brooklyn Bridge doing 60
Illegal driving from dusk to red dawn

Masada, wack MCs do me nada
King Solomon the great came to evaporate the fake

You recognize the voice, it's the nigga from the Wu
Every dart I spit gets mastered and promoted

Advisin' y'all that wise words is much slicker
Under circumstances label advances
Ample opportunity, infinite chances
To rhyme, so unrelated beef I don't stress
I seen many killed for infinitely less
Ya raps be the clips that's, packed with lies
Cowardlessly ya shoot up those innocent bys
In extra long verses, hundred bars in length
The percentage of the truth in the rhyme is one tenth
A solid mass of minerals, easily broke down
Hard rock MC's ya nuthin' but compound
Sparked by the endless greed of CEO's
In the videos, with those questionable flows
Take it twenty-six, cut it down to four bars, make it a hook
If it's not on the song it's in a book

Is it abstract commercial or hardcore?
Better know who the fuck they lookin' for

The CREAM of the crop we run circles that remain symmetrical
With lightnin' victories that's highly electrical
My microphone is just too hot to handle
Plus I don't fill ya ears with the, Pennister's scandal
I gift wrap the sawed-off, the DJ pump it
March to the sounds of Armstrong trumpet
Great things satisfy great minds
You want me to paint scenes describe it in eight lines
Check it
Conceptional breakthrough, incomprehensible
Rap that make you, convinced it's invincible
Lease up my words, powerful hazardous

Info, tempo, is gatherin' momentum
A thousand rounds of ammo wonderin' who spent them
Applied science to, vocals we flyin' through
Victorious always because I am who?

When ya move it accelerates the action of the venom

0% Finance,Pro Tools,2009.0,"I took her off the showroom floor no money down
Near the Chrysler building in the heart of Midtown
200 horse-power under the hood
Junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods
Designer frames with windshields that stay tinted
The most beautiful thing someone invented
Her wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
A sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
Rear view mirror that of Serena William
Staring was a crime then the look, kill 'em
Brushless showers and the Brazilian wax
Cash in the glove compartment free from tax
Low mileage on the odometer
Graduate with more degrees than a thermometer
Spark plugs for great conversation
She would focus on the finish line and destination
Steering in the right direction
Made sure I wore seat belts had air bags for protection
In her tank she loved to stash my tool
I kept her full, super-unleaded fuel
She had a room full of skirts and rims
The old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs
A temp at the Ford modeling agency
Suburban area where the Caucasians be
Her great-grandfather was a Cherokee Indian
Explorer and navigator traveling then begin
Sharpening his arrows on Plymouth Rock
Commander-in-chief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock
King of the frontier, rider of thoroughbreds
He was just as sharp as a needle without thread
Legend in truth but known to run the herd
His sons were oldsmobiles who drank thunderbird
Land cruisers
 sitting on fertile soil
With equipment that ran off expensive oil
Folks bragging said the horse pulled a Volkswagen
They love mustang sally and lollygagging
Fished in Lake Tahoe cooked the barracudas
Hunted impalas with the six-shooters
From a long range with the dog Rover
It was something else to see 'em knock them over

Some got caught in the crossfire
Bunch of rabbits indicating these dudes should retire
One was going bald rocking a sunroof
A gas guzzler in his grill was one tooth
A strong accent, and a beard like Lincoln
Who hated the golf course, but he loved drinking
Avenger, used to pick up chicks
Had magnums that were ram tough but thick
He wore blazers where he used to hide the Ruger
For encounters with the jaguars and cougars
A veteran who could salute and sing the anthem
In accord with the plan
 he was the phantom
He had a fat lady they called hummer
And umm, she needed body work the whole summer
She had a few friends who used to stay in a pound
Abandoned the parking lots, and junk yard bound
Regulars in rest areas and truck stops
Cassette players, known to make the tape pop
Gold diggers who on the cream like Wells Fargo
In Vegas, they circle around the Monte Carlo
You know the snakes with the fangs and vipers
Bloodsuckers who all used to piss from diapers
Met the Cavaliers at the Outback steakhouse
Chicken cutlets supreme just for takeout
One of them was forced to live in Astoria
Cause at the auction, they had crowned victoria
Since then her friends charged her battery
Had her running off with the sweets of flattery
She kept a loud muffler, couldn't trust her
Police used to always pull over this duster
A pothead who some called a firebird
A foul mouth, who could have used wiser words
Her man used to hustle and ran a crack corner
So insecure he kept LOJACK on her
Creeping with his visors low, high-beaming
Temper would accelerate, private eye scheming
He would check her consoles for rubbers
She would pass the inspection with flying colors
She would turn left if he said right
On her cycle, he would often run red lights
His voiced echoed as she dodged the convo
-----""PROTOOLS""-----
Her previous owner, all he did was bone her
Some drove her crazy, she was just a loner
He had her leaking transmission fluids
Said it was an accident, didn't mean to do it
No insurance with her grill decayed
She sobbed uncontrollably, still stayed
Another total eclipse of the heart
Like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
Plus he had a sidekick in his garage
And if he needed a boost, she would give him a charge
He was sentenced for running an escort service
Escaped from prison but made a few nervous
His baby mother had wifed a BMW
Number one on the list, so he brought trouble to
She done everything to regain her liberty
Tried to be outty, but went into delivery
Moved to Aspen, survived a avalanche
A different element, inside a fatter ranch
Far away, when she changed the pattern
The distance was like from Mercury to Saturn",https://genius.com/Gza-0-finance-lyrics
Big Bang Rap,Dark Matter,2013.0,"Before space and time, thought produced a speck of light
It was infinitely hot, so extremely bright
Within the center of this great shining
It was massive energy and it was expanding in great timing
Within this fireball was all of space of every special place with information encased
Literally, a beginning
This cosmic clock was ticking and allowed space to flow while it was spinning
Everything we see around us
The sun, the moon, the stars, millions of worlds that astound us
The universe inside is hard to fathom
It was composed in a region small as a single atom
Less than one trillionth the size the point of a pen
Microscopic but on a macro level within
Unfurling this swirling cloud of light
A star city, a galaxy with all its might
Within the blinking of an eye expanding beyond comprehension
Within a fraction of a second a new dimension
At a marble size very unstable
In time it would come with a periodic table

You see, space was expanding faster than light speed
It moving at the rate only thought can exceed
A picosecond after the Big Bang
Music of the spheres before the ears, the Universe is now sang
Small enough to fit in your hand, a nanosecond later
It was the size of Mars and becoming greater
Fraction of a second later 80 times the size of Earth
Fastest growing infant since the time of birth
Still expanding but it didn't contain matter
Just pure energy that was mixing within the batter
But mass and energy interchangeable
Convert those particles rearrange-able
Matter and anti-matter, the archrival
Met, obliterated each other for survival
A war zone, a battle to the death
But as long as there is life and breath there's one remaining left",https://genius.com/Gza-big-bang-rap-lyrics

Now it's the real beginning of the pages of Shams
Spit that heat rock that make fiends make vapors of grams
Sham's is the greatest fan, rock 
big cables of sands
Valleys and trunks
, I got the mack ten
We can hit the alley with iron and thumper
Take it to the hands like the brand new Leonard
Niggas going no mas, when the bullets go in him
You dealing with a night stick toker
The ice pick poker, trust you ain't like this joker
And the set, devoted to opening your neck
With the tech, as you sit in a Lex'
Your next move, is slipping, 
your last move is shitting
As your body gets soft, the shotty went off
Little soldiers, you're out of position
Guns go off,
 Shams is a Raiders fan
A rhyming gallop reporter, columns are lost
White five, black five with dollars to toss
Twisted by the dark side of the force
Black biscuit, by park side in a Porsche
You're off sides in the fort
We are survivors of the war of good and evil
I'm in the hood, in the hood with a Desert Eagle
With my Brooklyn peoples, now feel it

Darkman, my persona's like Tony Montana
How he used to sniff coke, how I puff marijuana
Try, play me today, I'mma kill you mañana
From, far with the K, or up close with the llama
I'm like an African king in a castle in Ghana
Chest dripping with jewels
, one hell of a rhymer
Study lessons in Medina
, building with an old timer
So I, always been wise ever since a young minor
Get CREAM by any means, follow Malcolm X theme
So I'm often posted, in a window with that thing
Got unlimited support from the Sing-Sing regime
I'm Hannibal Smith and they like the A-Team
Keep my head on the swivel, when I serve a dope fiend
Upgraded, to a digital, from a triple beam
Fucking with me, you better be real as you can be
La Trapacandi, a well known rhyme general

Who say Ras Kass don't spit fire, he a liar
That's like your favorite rap star claiming he gon' retire
When you mention me, not about penitentiary
Wins and rhyme skills, both twenty second century

Timbuktu
Cause I'm original, like 
Black Falasha Jews

Try us, fuck you
You die y'all got gats but him buck too, nigga
Sip the Grey Goose and ponder, then order room service
In Hotel Rwanda, reminder to honor these street scholars
Who ask why U.S. Defense is twenty percent of the tax dollar
Bush gave 6.46 billion to Halliburton
For troops support efforts in Iraq
Meanwhile, the hood is hurting, please believe that
The rape over, Chaney talking, twenty five dollars for a case of soda
Draining tax payers, eighty five thousand dollar oil filters
But won't pay they soldiers,
 
Halliburton
 workers make
Fourteen thousand dollars a month, 
privates earn thirteen g's a year
Plus 225 extra, taking fire in combat
Recruit all the niggas, that die from where I'm at
18 years olds told to kill, where Saddam at
But can't have a gat, to protect where my Mom's at
I love to crunk, so what, plus I'm gangsta enough
To piss in 
Pimpin Ken's
, pimp cup, rack a gauge and pump it up
Hot bitches still get fucked, 
niggas just want a forty and a blunt

Yo, these youngsters they grow up on the block
With the product in they socks and the fully loaded Glocks
Too many die in vain, and it's a crying shame
The murders and the hustles, won't stop as they shoot for the top
Acquiring power through growth and development
On they most dangerous missions, excuses were irrelevant
The brutality of war, never changes
And the out of control desire to win, makes it dangerous
Fire engulfed the set, they feel the threat, greater than
What they ever had, experienced yet
Indictments, sparked excitement, and the thrill to kill
Suddenly they felt the need for a challenge and they feel
The great boundaries of both man and machine
Can have one at the point, to murder all in between
Yellow tape scene, dead teen, the mob was his idol
Giving a grim new meaning to the neighborhood's title

1112,Beneath the Surface,1999.0,"Bobby said: “Fuck spending fifty on a whip, buy equip”
Mental flip, he got a thousand tracks stored on a chip
Said he had mad toys to make noise
He split and separate drums like asteroids
The concerned producer sampled this question
Hit him with the beat for the answer with extra compression
My sound travel, it quickly grab you
And equalize the pitch up, until it have you
Bugged out, tryna think you can match this
The portraits are too graphic
Panoramic view for you, stamp Wu
The beats are Gothic, the outcome will be catastrophic
We roadblocked it, checkpoints on your next joint
Now, who the nigga you anoint?
700 volts on the track to slay
Murderous wordplay displayed from killing cascades
Throwing bullets in the air to test wind
Which way the cyclone spin? Counter or clockwise?
Still civilized
Kill spies on the wall as still flies, all dies

Give no extension on the lynching
It's tension if the name of the Clan is mentioned
It's the aura that's felt that causes one to flash his gun
And reveal how he really feel, confirmed
He'll never live after the show
See the promoter for the dough I'm taking, breaking his wax
Throwing my shit on to perform the selection from the Swarm
Day 2 breaks, it's a stormy Monday
My ninjas lay in ravines and ditches, underneath shrubs and leaves
They breathed through underwater reefs
The enemy walks above, Clan remains subterraned in mud
Off shore banks, tanks approach the location
Bombarded by the circle of death formation
Telecom lines are sniped from these low altitude strikes
Shattering bulletproof helmets with shrapnel fragments of cell
Inhale these venomous thoughts that I propel
Through the north facility, the city must suffer
At the hand of the Chief's command, volts are sent
At three minute intervals the heat intenses
Deadening the power from electrical fences
Defenses are down, shake a nigga up
Bounce him off the sound

You know what I'm saying?
The God ca-diver, in the streets of Iris
We talk about sex, money and drugs
(Ruled by power) And y'all cats don't know
What it's about (Love and power)
It goes deeper than what you see on TV
Come on

Burning desire, ebony eyes
Painted toenails, legacies die
Women by the well, Egyptian queens
Arabian sheiks paid to knock off rich kings for the joy some sing
Graveyards filled with scarlet widows
Stabbed they husbands, sleeping on silk pillows
Blood on they robes, disguised as beggar in cheap wool clothes
Lambs and wolves in black hoods pull out they gats
Like magic wands, casting spells, sending niggas to Hell
Trapping they souls in realms
Baptize them with Holy Water
Springing on the heads of plenty witches' daughters
Interviews with the richest reporters, silent nights over Nevada
A thousand Muslims bow before the Kaaba
Hebrews flee to the hills of Masada
For the love of God, guns make a loud sound
I'ma show you how thugs get down
Shootouts, bullets turn into bloodhounds and hunt you down
Cursed nation, lost generation
X-Files found them in the future as cosmic rulers
Fallen angels from space intruders
Dying saints, blood spilled on the floor like wet paint
See it in the pictures, read it, like the lost scriptures
Absorb it with your 100 proof liquor

Huh; I shot the sheriff and the deputy secondly
Threatening the lives of those who threaten me
Lessening my chances of defeat by predetermining the victory
As taught by Sun Tzu in the chapter, after the third one
I heard my word shall be born, regardless to anything or anyone
Or else I die by the gun, my life has just begun
Thought I was living all along, but I was wrong
This long road I have to travel, in countless battles
These filthy snakes with poison fangs and rattles
Kings, queens and pharaohs changed to cattle
Unable to duck the Devil's arrow
Singing that his eye's on the sparrow, mind narrow
Superstitions, horoscopes and tarots
“Hark Heralds Angels” and Christmas carols
Graven images hang from the mantels
Man-made slaves in modern day Babel
Brought from Africa in golden robes and sandals
By wicked thieves and vandals
Who manhandled us with leather whips and burning candles
And rambled through our castle, leaving niggas shambles
Stole our gold and sold us like some Arab camels
We gazed, amazed and baffled as he loaded his ammo
Into the barrel and blasted out our bone marrow
We were the Gretel and the Hansel, tricked by this wicked jackal
Children of my grand-old-daddy have me
In mind when they're lost in this wilderness blind",https://genius.com/Gza-1112-lyrics
Pass the Bone,Words From the Genius,1991,"No stems no seeds that you don't need
Acapulco gold is… BAD ASS WEED

Yo, this is the Giga-Giga-Genius
And I got the brother Prince Rakeem on the side
You know we got the sess bones in the house
And yo, God, I'ma pass you the bone
(Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, so I can rule the microphone)

Rakeem is feeling lovely, word, a pocket full of dough
A little drunk, reaction's mad slow
Thinking, should I go to the club scene?
(And do what?) And bag a rub-a-dub queen
Another thing, beyond the cream, I wanted to get ripped
Put my lips on a blunt tip
It's been two weeks, since I last scored (What'd you do?)
Went down to the club floors
Five dollar fee, plus ID
But a brother like me gassed his way in for free
Word, took a bar seat
Got a tall glass of Sex on the Beach
And turned to my left, saw this girl she was slamming, sir
(Ooh, what ya do kid?) I examined her
Pushed up, I tried to bag her for her name
(What happened?) I didn't have the game
Overwhelmed by a scent in the air
Could it be? Yes, yeah, a potent bag of sess there
It was Raekwon and Loungin' Lo
They had a bone (You mean a blunt?) A palmetto
I said, ""Pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone""
They passed it, took one pull, I was blasted
Felt kind of stimulated, fan-ta-stic
Re-approached the weak-cypher
(Did you surprise her?) I tranquilized her
Bagged her for her name and address
Slid to her rest, achieved mad success
(But did you bone her?) Did I bone her?
Did I bone her? You should've heard her moan (uh!)

Pass the bone, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Yo, Genius, flip the microphone
Yo, pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone so I can rule the microphone

Yo, check it
Outside a nightclub, what? We shine some young bloods
Drinking forties right down to the suds
Ready to flow inside and rip the mic phone
Hmm, and all I needed was a sess bone
And guess who come down the block stumbling drunk?
(Who?) Ason, with two bags of skunk
Pull out the blunt, put the weed inside
Roll it up tight, then the flame was applied
Inhale, but not pertaining to cough
Exhale, you know, like two pulls and off
Stimulated kind of toxie
Seen a girl who was foxy, yo, but she needed OxyWash
Oh my gosh, yo, not to disrespect but back to the subject
The brothers rolled up on the scene that I had known
Smelled the skunk and said ""Yo pass the bone!""
I said, ""Lounge, G, there's not enough to pass around
So, go get a bag from Uptown""
I gave a pound to the brothers who was sweating me
What about the Wisdoms? Yo, they was stressing me
""Hey Genius, Genius, when ya gonna come do me
Step to me, you know, screw me?""
Just another redbone that I had bagged in the red zone
And took home to get my head flown
Forget about the weak-cipher, so I slid to the back
Leaving tracks of smokestacks
That originated from the sess crops
Give me the mic and watch me get props

Pass the bone, yo kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid, pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Pass the bone so I can rule the microphone",https://genius.com/Gza-pass-the-bone-lyrics

On my back, striped out black
You like that? Seven rays in my head
My girl stays in the bed and she love to lay the eggs

Prepare for the mic onslaught swift with the sword
Slick Lord, holding my weight home and abroad
The crowd roared for the peeps playing for the streets
I reaped and sewed, scriptures weaved and vowed
Behold gold for the people equal
Fresh on the weekend
Wu-Tang, Biggie Smalls live at the Beacon
Backstage drinks on the house the show was banging
Brothers Grey Goosing, Wu was Tanqueraying
Allah teaching schools in session, the Gods speaking

Waiting for the hour to devour
And splatter ya heads to powder
I'm a slave to the rhythm
But never to a mental deafened power

Why is the axis slanted?
How much is covered by water?

Flowing like the chi energy inside your artery
Faithful as a Palestine rock against a tank
The force of my will still kill shooting blanks

Behind the rope  with my rhyme on cock
Verse shot, first  who had  to pop
My bad weather blew the feathers off a hundred flocks
Seventy-percent goose, thirty duck
Get stuck, if each link in your chain is struck
Can't come in the rhyme cypher with non-snipers
Charge off the juice from the pied pipers
Grew up around B-Boys, DJs, MCs
Through rap, never thinking their ways of TV
It was strictly all about about magnificent rhyme clout
The R.E.C. Room, two dollars with the flyer, three without
Now it's wigs pushed back, name's removed
Off the plaque, too wild to reenact
With tax, that's the price to pay, my goal is to
Aim and spray; my night is the same as day

Where the most live catch Vibe and Blaze heat
Double XL kings who rush through got Right On
Quick to Stress ya sound crew to get a mic on
Math lets the plates Spin
Consecutive hits, promoters' face grin, the dawn catch fist
Keep the paper direct wire, see MJ retire
Unlike the story that echoes out from chronic liars
Like those who feast on hogs, eat Murder Dogs
A Village Voice kid with his heart and soul calm
Killa Beez produce the honey that fortify the platinum
Plus the DJ claws fiend to scratch them
Thus, street team take shots at criticism
Promotional vehicles wiffin with mad rhythm
With the lockout of one of our Source Sports
We spice the stand and launch the stage on the ball court
During the first half, number one draft
Rap lords swing swords, slam microphone, shatter Billboards
Forty-eight in sight after inhaling the herb
Vision impaired when the silhouette emerged
One nut out the Clan
Get your whole clique banned from radio
PDs cut your raps man
Forcing me to move on from one world to another
On the gulf from the fuel Jet to hover
Take cover wit the radical Urban Latino
No Hip-Hop Connection wit Us and Janet Reno
I do an interview and they aim to trace my Essence
To know more than is necessary blunts your weapon
My group's Nova, remain unsober
And serve High Times with king cobras
I shoulder low-post MCs, your whole style la feast
Second to get your Word Up then the troops unleash
Creative Loafing to the grand opening
With my ray gun scoping, you're hoping
Uniforms be fridged when they walk the Black Beat
In the heat of razors exposing fresh meat
In Bedrock and Gambling, Rolling Stone out of zone
Where they can't monitor my 'xact poem
Collide with the Tiger Beat, Rap et Ragga

Then came rap czars, left tracks in scars
Apparent brightness of exploding stars

Legend of the Liquid Sword,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"Who won the covenant role, based on a nationwide poll?
For the grip tales told and rap scrolls
Perfect pitch for language that's built within
Where half the rap ink couldn't hold my pen
Meanin' when emcees came, to live out the name
They signed the documents with the, blood of the slain
Far removed from this hip hop life off course
But the confidence and resilience was never lost
In the think tank and research labs I laid tracks
Seen work rule my life but it never broke my back
Destiny forever shake from the events to come
From the father and the chemical contents of the sun
A solid gold figure with a verse that glitters
Until the platinum beat comes increasingly bitter
They joined in a likely alliance with the rest
Schemin' with unsuccessful in a zealous Quest
We all see, with a degree of certainty
Who the fake, cowardly cats behind the curtains be
(Yeah, yeah...)
They hunt, for the skin, flesh, the blood, and bones
In front, want to impress with 
studdes
 stones

Of the Liquid Sword?

About the pyroclastic flow
Hotter than the spark that made it blow
You better recognize, recognize....

My U-N-I-verse run like clockworks forever
Words pulled together, sudden change in the weather
The nature and the scale of events don't make sense
A storm with no warnin', you're drawn in by immense
Gravity that's gone mad, clouds of dust and debris
Moving at colossal speeds, they crush an emcee
Since this rap region is heavily packed with stars
Internal mirror in the telescope, noticed the Czar
From far away, they blink as the lightnin' strolled
Great distance of space between precise globes
That travel in a circular of order
Like the tape in your cassette recorder, filled with corporate slaughter
(Yeah, yeah...)
Meaning the con-tracts manifestly work
The hitman for hire, weapon in his hand he lurks
In spite of the strange appearance he laid a clearance
On his target through a crowded market
No interference
The microphone left on the scene without a serial
Evidence consistent with organic material (Well)
Surprisingly, as we marched lively with great size and degree
'Til it spread widely

Now who's the man who brought you the Legend
Of the Liquid Sword?

The Mexican,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Chico Fernandez
Sleeping on his guns

Shot rare coins for practice
Map to the fortune, hidden up under the mattress
A lead belt attaches with holsters
Waiting area, two blazing toasters
Hit the stage coach on stallions
Looking for Federal Reserve notes and gold medallions
Heavily pursued by the local governor, a southerner
Sought after by the whole battalion
Fell out a snake within the handshake
Get the drop on them then he exploited the mistake
Protecting his gold he sold by the plates
Ready to shoot while his horses drank from the lake
Deputy saved by the badge on the blazer
A warning shot from one that had the aim of a lazer
Trait by the neighbor a gambler
Who would stack the deck, plus he marked cards wit a razor

Chico Fernandez
Sleepin' on his guns
Dreams of Santa Anna
Fighting in the sun
Drums so loud from outside
Makes it hard to dream
A bruise is forming hard and fast
Makes it all seem real
Mornin’, come mornin’
A Chico’s gotta have his share
Mornin’, sad mornin’
What a laugh, and I cried
And I cry, cry, cry, cry, cried

He used to move weight but then became a grower
Constricted boa, the Mochis Sinaloa
Cooperating along in mining zones
For mostly silver and other shining stones
Abandoned political rebel
He moved with a group of Pistoleros flashing heavy metals
Clash with the law triggered intense reactions
Hard labor gave them multiple contractions
Lawmen turned to outlaw, gunfighter cattle rustlers
Hustlers ruff riders useless connections
Everything traversal
Cross stone socio-economic circles

Senorita pining
Chico, come on home
Santa Anna’s losing
You’ll be first to go
Sam Houston’s laughing
Davy Crockett too
When Anna takes the Alamo
The first to go is you
Mornin’, come mornin’
A Chico’s gotta have his share
Mornin’, sad mornin’
Heaven will be there

Mornin’, sad mornin’
What a laugh and a laugh

Life Is a Movie,Pro Tools,2010.0,"I got scientist killas that'll jam your cell phone
Send a text message, kill you off with a ringtone
High pitched noise, on your brain, it's heavy
Autopsy report, that he jumped off a train
It started when the dearly departed, tried to escape max'
Then cut into the general's income like state tax
One call, to seal the deal with feel
Doctor on the payroll, cost a quarter mill

The mailman's late with the check
I'm in the flood with a bunch of bills that's about up to my neck
Plus my rent's not paid and the light's about to go off
Car got stolen by a thief who likes to show off
I can't even get a job, giving out flyers
I'm a handyman with a pair of broke pliers
The fridge is bare as Mother Hubbard's cupboard
I'm so down and out, I can only go upward

I form rhymes in alphabet soups
From the rhythm of the spoon, I transform the loop
From the steam of the bowl, I'm making special effects
Add a dash of spice, only God can detect
Had a word, to make a bear return to his cub
A word that make a girl come home from the club
A word that make a demon return back to God
And the word that help Dorothy get home from Oz
Thirty frames per second, these films we be perfecting
Scenes of light put through all projection
Electricity, perfectivity
Audio and visually, physically and mentally

I got a smile that'll make the mirror crack
And I seem to stay under clouds that's pitch black
So when it rains, it pours, and when it pours, I'm soaked
I contracted lung cancer from third-hand smoke
And uh, I'm like the frog that's dying to be a prince
The boy who cried wolf and no one was convinced
The man who hit lotto and lost his ticket
In a rainstorm, and struck by lightning trying to get it

And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
Play it all back, play it all back

Lights, camera, action, let the tape roll
Some scripts get ripped, canned or even sold
Directors vision, producers decision
And raised the budget, because the chase had collisions
Stunt double risks his life just for the thrill
DP checks the gate before the scene gets sealed
Gaffer slapped with a slate for being late
Craft service got nervous and dropped a hundred plates
Leading actor banging an extra in the trailer
Screaming, hitting high notes like Mahalia
Box office hit and a Blockbuster smash
Two hundred mil' budget and still recouped the cash

And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film
And sometimes I feel like my life's a movie
I don't like to film, I don't like to film

Auto Bio,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"I was born, witht the mic in my hand
Then I took it from Medina, to the S.I. land
I pulled up on the block, go out the truck
It was the first of pit stops
The era of the spinnin' tops, the birth of hip hop
That was somethin', I had identified with
So I, made it my point to exploit this fly gift then
Myself and RZA, made trips to the B.X
A mass of ferocious M.C.'s and talent T-Rex
Giants in every ways, rap flows for every day
We knew we would get a reward for the price we'll pay
The basic training was beyond entertainment
Just the cadence of the verbal expressions, self explainin'
Wore my boots out in constant walks across the borough
Tore the troops out the frame when they challenge the most thorough
From well concealed firing positions we let off the most
Dangerous with that, slang that just shatter the coast
They say I rhyme like the bank that stop
Cause M.C.'s be more shook than the dice that drop
Especially if I'm rollin', then the point is definitely proven
Cause with the GZA holdin', that keep a nigga movin'
I walk Broadway, from Quincy to Myrtle
Back to Quincy, cut careers whatever the expense be
They heard the Legend, run to the reverend
With headaches and blackouts, worse then seventy seven

And when my job is done
And it's time to get those that's comin' up some runs
So you can see where they from, from, from...
They say the product is good
We gonna sling it from the slums of the hills of the hood
'Til it's understood

We still search through the crates of songs that just breaks
At times we play legendary battles on tapes
Unlikely confrontation with a clash of swords
Energy that was stored, be rain that just poured
On cats and dogs, water that, flooded the stance
The violence and nature had trigged the violence of man
That was bloodshed, from which said, audible threats
Publicize regrets, wanted alive or dead
A hand full recovered from the dramatic plunge
While the rest kept babblin' and speakin' in tongues
Since the competition already slayed them in a scrimmage
He continued tarnish that, already faded image
Any sport, when they come short, majors don't need 'em
Then they broke, lose they homes, lively hood and freedom
The rhyme could be a blunt object that make you choke
Like too many tokes, that'll retard your growth
This Witty Unpredictable Talent or Natural Game
With non added of slang, it's all actual fact
The high roller knock the chip off the shoulder
Strike like the perfect bowler, with catastrophic damage
My other's hard to vanish, punishment, swift to sudden
Unparalleled advantage, brought to a level where you froze and can't speak
Trapped in the frigid temperatures of that peak",https://genius.com/Gza-auto-bio-lyrics
Highway Robbery,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"An MC stepped to me, lying about one
Kid that rolled with him who died in the outcome
Thinking he could get with me, gain victory
When the season's all on his beef was hickory
The situation at hand still remained critical
The check analytical, reaction was pitiful
He pushed his pawn up, yo that's a wrong move

the contours of the land
Intricate architects that's linked to a plan
The W-U-hyphen-T-A-N-G
My rap flow automatic and never empty
Don't tempt me, quick to bust off another
Flee in that direction you could get it from my brother
At least then you know that you up against G-O-D
So when we throw those grenades you better be
Ready, not iced out and petty
Neckful couldn't match one oil drop from Getty
That's ran by the icon who just left Exxon
And spilled oil so he could cash checks on
The strength cause local niggas be hating
But the sound still travels from state to state and
No dress code, boot, hats and all metal
Strictly hip hop underground and all ghetto
So catch it, throw it on your plate and scratch it
Mix that , y'all niggas can't do 

Stick it up like it's a highway robbery
True gangstas we run New York City
We come fi takeover the industry
Cause you know them have fi too 'fraid of we

How come so much rap  sound so similar
Is it confusing for you to remember the
Originator
, paint sprayer, crafts innovators
Quick close ups of the artform's life savors
From tapes to decks, beats with raps, streets with gats
Speaking of tracks, I've ran plenty laps
The crates were packed, Farms were Phat
Thieves would chat to stab my back, detect many traps
Hazardous enterprise, the youths energized
Not seeing the truth till it's in your eyes
Burning, you learning to power your rhyme
Exert maximum damage in minimum time
Road L's are lit, my spears start to hit
Strange translation of words of wit
Through the cable transmit' and once the shoe fit
Unlock the secret of prophecies and that's it
Stay submerged deep as we cruise the seas
Beneath the Surface just like Adidas and Lee's
Or a croke head that used to walked the length
From Brooklyn to get a beat on 43rd and 10th
And that's just a short trip to flip without a whip
Tried to shop this most extravagant gift
To a cat who wasn't hemped and never opened doors
Till he accidently seen it on the shelves of stores
That's more frightning than strikes of lightning
Tearing up the storm in your average college dorm
So think about it when you trying to flow
When you wanna step to us I think you should know",https://genius.com/Gza-highway-robbery-lyrics
Firehouse,Pro Tools,2008.0,"My life rest in a .45, aim for the head, chest fortified
Sons look for revenge, out of stress, daughters cry
Gotta do it here, can't afford to try
Thought the gutter ended in the 'Ville, then I saw the 'Stuy
They get wet daily, it's a live nigga water ride
Slow and steady win the race, step aside, let the tortoise by
It's the hunted man, street value hundred grand
Instinct, nothing planned, been through shit you couldn't understand
Cain, Hec, and Dawuan - I'm repping the lifeless
Weapon of crisis, guns run out, I'm steppin' in
Checkin' for secondary devices, live in the real world
Fuck bitches, get love from a real girl, raised my sister
Amongst the slime and the crime, now she a ill pearl
You never seen nothing like me, I'm for those who get it on nightly
You need a boost of strength, put it on, recite me
I tour with toast, cuz drama's always close
Feeling the waves, kill the praise, applaud my folks
From the core, the most raw, absorb the quotes
For sure I'm the cure, and there's more of the dose
Yeah, I'm from the bottom but I look forward to gross

In the gutter, some ride, some chill (some chill)
I'm from the gutter, some 'Stuy, some 'Ville (some 'Ville)
Know many brothers, some cry, some build
Word to the mother, some lie, some steal (steal)
Some get popped, some die, some heal (some heal)
Some get knocked, some hide and some real

(But that's gutter where Ka and them chill)

Slim nigga with the fat pound, back down
Most brolic dude, try to move, hit him in the face
Never again taste solid food. Same nigga
If I'm in solitude, or with the wildest crew
Bulletproof down my coats like Ghost's wallets, too
I run wit a crook or two, look who escaped out Brooklyn Zoo
Fuck that queen, I show you what a knight, and a rook'll do
New York City Bronson, heat up quicker than Vinnie Johnson
The block got Bloods now, it's like a mini Compton
To have honey smiling, need money piling
Bundles, bundles, bundles, a hundred thousand
That's why with my gun I'm browsing
On the hottest strip to see who I gotta hit to start running housing
I listen to my id, respect my ego
If I need council, bounce through, check my people
The first on Earth with the same thirst I accept is equal
Never move with crews, you'll lose, they steps beneath you
I rep it lethal in beef, might elect to mesquite you
From where the beast greet you, do as much as dirt as us, but they preach lethal
The block is class, the blast from the heat teach you
Get one lesson, fail, oh well, the streets keep you
Pat his jeans, one magazine, sheet sleep you

In the gutter, some ride, some chill (some chill)
I'm from the gutter, some 'Stuy, some 'Ville (some 'Ville)
Know many brothers, some cry, some build
Word to the mother, some lie, some steal (steal)
Some get popped, some die, some heal (some heal)
Some get knocked, some hide and some real
(Some even bust shots, some live, some kill)
(But that's gutter where Ka and them chill)

I embody, every nigga who carried a shotty
Forced to grow up quick, never sat on the potty
Went from crawl to run, we want all or none
Being fatherless bothered us, everybody we called 'em son
Block scholastic, sellin chips from the rock jurassic
For heavy glory, mark territory 'fore I rot in casket
Thought our young committee was gon' run the city
One fears being unprepared, so I brung the Smitty
If you dare come and get me, I'm from royalty
I represent myself, don't need no lawyer fee
People call on me, cuz I'm ready when it's urgent
Too much grace to tremble, hand steady as a surgeon",https://genius.com/Gza-firehouse-lyrics

Out my motherfucking mind
Metal shine, light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the lamp pole
Fifteen twenty-inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, massive feedback
Allah Math spin the beat back
The crowd look while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tons of snow
Wrote this rhyme in video, verbal assassin
Blastin, exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Gain control, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I seen a million try to set afloat, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual they forgot to frisk so
Now his pursuit is not without risk
A special no thanks for being flank
While journalists stay runnin in front of tanks
Flew out first class, came back, closed task
Rough path surfaces, no math
Military campaign, bust shots, cause inflammation of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Feel the pain, niggas reign

Quickly drop non-stop rec shot
What I took on the road on the lap and desktop
A mixture from up-tempo to slow grooves
8-Track figure that's mixed wit Pro Tool
I rhyme wit sense the paragraph was intense
Area's dense with the flow from the sentence
Engine powered by five hundred horses
Press by a threat of joint forces
For emcee's who spit rap to cause beef
Cause they depend on wild kill for fresh meat
On the board, you're just a piece that's captured
Weak as the lamb that's laying in the pasture
The plug that gave ya juice, I might pull it
Can't escape these endless waves of rap bullets

I'm not insane in fact I'm kinda rational
Chrome-plated serrated swords slashing you
I shine light to the mic
That's filled with the unspoiled water that's rich with life
But um, you get high off the wealth and livin' large
We rely on the stealth of camouflage
Cut supply lines, flood ya mans market
From high altitude cover the land target
Lost in the desert, the journey is stressful
Where the rescues are unsuccessful
They perish while they search for it, intriguing treasures
Shoulda taken precautionary measures
The rhyme with the shank in the yard that kept stabbing ya
A shakedown from Alcatraz to Attica
Because we rock the jails
Where the inmates write the verse on the walls of cells

Hit ya king with a Check that caused directly damage ya disco tech
Shoulda' Protect ya Neck

And do they think they got me? I don't know
They seen ya picture baby? Don't think so
Now do your mission and while you were thinking
Ain't no collision that'll stop me from screaming

Involving movements, controlling the squares that's closed in
Wit impact, in fact ya zone is frozen
Submerged in deep blocks of ice
Scheming a wise by the high-tech devise
The slightest fame can bring pain and torture
The author, who came with a burning offer
Published by whoever made it must own it
Is just an atonement for one chaotic moment

They got no place for me

Broadway classical, led men to rage
Like currents, the beat change and now a flow is strange
You in the arctic wit wolves that viciously maim
Thugs that roam clubs, in the dark wit fireworks that spark

Broke down vessels who want a boost, there's no jokes

Bust ya, slash ya, we still thick like plaster
There's always potential for large scale disasters

On the ropes, hanging from the towel and cliffs and slopes

The collective laws of countless souls lay in the road

Insane flower, vein blower
Aim and it's game over

Got the code to the game and I hold the main controller
Soldiers from the jump, and today the same soldier
I stay low, play close to bank rolls
Polly with the greatest who walk the same road

We rhyme back-to-back, dangerous emcees
Move on track-to-track 100 bar measure
Lost treasure, those crews who never gave us much pleasure
Agreed the sound was good, shoppin' in the state, city, town and hood
Eventually they would
Lay down the trademark with god that built wealth
To dip-dive in the beehive was on self
For the power struggle, never clown but did juggle
The heavy load made it explode to mad rubble

They sue for Cash Rule but the courts they give 'em nothing
Your soundman came with the feedback like we need that
Security's shining flashlights like ""where the weed at?""
Stay in your place, see you guys smoke blowing in your face
And it's hard to stop it once we came to drop it
Who bold enough to challenge this deadly reportation
Of keeping MC's in a hopeless situation
No comparison, if you put the darts side by side
One will weigh out the other
Like friend next to brother
Try to take cover as the battle comes to a closion
That structure that supported your rap started implosion
Your whole chest and your world caved in
They completely gave in, they was far from brave men

Ain't caring, so you're hearing what I said
I'm making sure it stick
Like a stamp you don't lick
Or a snare with no kick
So you know it be authentic like the hand-made works of a carpenter
The 64 squares make 'em use a sharpener
Kept a fine point with the lead, then it's thread
On the paper then like cancer it would rapidly spread
This music is addictive but can't live without it
At times you shout it The Wu, they be about it
A strong following with the die-hard supportedly
The loyalty came from the songs that went accordingly
I couldn't be more wrong if I changed the format
Did something different from the most explored rap

Then I see this lady with a hellafied body
With a pair of bedroom eyes that were clocking The Genius
Well, you see what I mean is
She had the look as if she was attracted
To me so what I did, I reacted
In a manner to show that I was feeling the same
Now check out the game
I said lovely, I be The Genius and how ya doing?
I'm on a chase and you're the one that I'm pursuing
She said it's the pleasure Genius, I'm doing kinda fine
But what's on your mind?
I said

Girl
Come Do Me

I said sexy, where you live over yonder?
What's your name? She said, ""It's Yolanda""
She said she knew me from back in the days
And that I had her running on a wild sex craze
I said now you're kinda big and well-developed
And parts of your body just made my head swell up
She said her feelings were so deep for me
To the point where she wanted to sleep with me
I said c'mon babe, I know you're jokin'
She said if I'm jokin' you must be smokin'
I said the only think I wanna be smokin' is your boots
And she said ""I hear ya troop""
And just from that little bit of conversation
It put my hormones into activation
The whole thing just went to my head
As I held her hands and said
Baby, come do me


Hey good looking how many times may I say
That your gorgeous smile takes my breath away
Your soft warm little voice is very pleasing
And your tight mini-skirt is kinda teasing
Me, it makes me wanna do the nasty
And you got the look of being very classy
So go ahead and whip it on me

Heavy foot traffic jam the hallway all day
Adolescence working for small pay
World so little he could never leave his block
His home bullet-riddled so he always need his Glock
He coast with his eye open, keep his metal smoking
Young wasted minds fiending on dimes, coking
Forgot kids quick to break rules and known to make fools
Out of many, down the streets we more safe than school
There's no diploma that can break you from the coma
Of a bloody war in the country, the youth hungry
On the corner hyenas amongst me
Yapping 'bout the stories they be hearing, always swearing
Can't even spell the shit that he be wearing
Caught up in the silk web of material
Superficial stains ya brain tissue, that's the issue
The young is lost at their own cost, dreaming
Screaming how we never hold positions, that's the meaning
Mothers of murder victims share the same grief
The elderly shake their head in disbelief
And no relief came 'til I aimed
And blast one shot and left my name... the GZA

Just another victim of the... victim of the ghetto
Just Another victim, that's how it goes, ooh

My residence is a city where army veterans smoke rocks
On torn down blocks, drug spots set up their shops
And cops watch innocent niggas roaming in flocks
Romanism in tops, papers and knots
Churches and liquor stores on every corner plot
To get money knots some funny niggas act like
They could pop Glocks and those who can't cop
Sisters giving up ass a lot, brothers giving up cash a lot
Babies struggling to become someone because their parent's not
Just another victim of the ghetto, where lost minds settle
When the devils uncivil society and die free
With double 'W' followed by J-D around the necks and wrists
The God is now a dog, the Earth is called a bitch
And all my people wish to get rich in this wilderness to push a Lexus
Ice on everything from rings and bracelets to the necklaces
Children molested within these pest-infested buildings
Seeds uneducated in these schools, paint on the ceilings
Is peeling off, but all I see is lost black babies calling
""Please somebody save me, please somebody save me""

Jukebox is slamming throughout the bright moon
With the melody, of a soft Barry White tune

Holding my dick as I talk to the barmaid
Excuse me miss, ""Alright here I come
May I help you?"" Yeah, double shot of rum
""On the rocks sir?"" Mm-mmm, not at all
Who the fucks need ice inside of burning alcohol
I reach in my pockets to tip the whore
But I'm clumsy, my change start falling on the floor
I play macho, and say leave it for the sweeper
BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP my fucking beeper
I start stumbling to the phone booth
Revealing all symptoms of drinking ninety proof
The phone booth door is closed, the light is on
The girlie just dialed nine-seven-zero porn
She sit back, with her legs cocked in the air
While her fingers do the walking through her knotty pubic hair
Her eyes are shut tight, she moans and groan
I hit the glass, ""Get the fuck off the phone!""
She jumped up and said, ""You just had to be the one
To interrupt me when I was having so much fun""
I said, ""Hold up, yo, bitch you think it's cute
To be perverted, let alone a sleazy prostitute?""

Or me and my homegirls just because we sell?""

Watchin females posin for a flick
Thinking of who would be the first to turn a trick
""Yo Genius you see that?"" ""Yeah"" ""So what you think?""
""Let's swing em to the nearest spot to have a drink""
I winked at one she said, ""Hi"" in a low pitch
Rakeem started flowing and bagged the other ho bitch
Now we searchin for a zebra lounge
To settle down, right in the heart of midtown
Went to this place called the Sting Pit
Got inside and seen all types of shit
Men who looked soft but acting wild
Dancing to the beat, Ten City style
Females who wore jeans that were tight
With faces resembling transvestites
Everyone in the bar gave my girlies mean looks
As if they were fugitive crooks
They smiled at me and the God, showin all thirty-two
That's when I caught the clue
As this redbone, who thought she looked fly
Rolled up on me, and she said ""Hi""
That one little word fucked up the whole night
Her voice was deeper, than Barry White
I jumped up, and boy did I flip
I pull out a nine and I empty the clip
The place was flowin with crazy blood
A little midtown massacre type flood
And as we stepped off from the scene

Not knowing, heavyweight throwing vocal hooks
Rhyming off Apache
, the RZA scratch thee
Records borrowed from Home Alone kid known as Latchkey
Break beat fanatic, crates deep in attics
45s marked up, looped with static
Rap ring heavy, each link in my chain, truck's Chevy
Flare ripped from the magic lair of medley
But deadly, I merge forward with a sharp spear
He must return now, his flight departs here
Like Sitting Bull, I lay with my bow pulled
Arrow poisonous cause my enemy clip's full
Stay in the venue, with the party promoters, life parolers
Half the crowd wild, 9 m&m holders
Apply boulders, smash your allied soldiers
Intimate footage roll off the cameraman's shoulders
Many will die for fame, moving like Leroy
Can't be one and the same, nah, that ain't b-boy
The decoy, scan this with high tech radar
Til' my mic strike, leave a state-size crater
I came into this with the writer's block
To prevent a sudden shock on a large flock
Clips are uncut episode, invincible armor
I blaze one, once I strike the match off my bomber

Adjust this, til its EQ'ed like never
Watch ya megawatts, bang spots, raise the lever
It's Operation Cobra, it's over
Control the globe slowly, the bold soldier

My rough cut metal tapes, quick to break label mates
Won't hesitate to negotiate your table stake
First lesson came from the session, room one
From the longest awaited but the strongest made it
Complex, complicated, compressed, elongated
Homicidal, subtitle, Wu claw, banger off the ocean shore
Kid jaw, cut with the jigsaw
Intern engineer, vest on the youth
Make the mic booth bulletproof from sparked wires
From autofire rapid from a verbalist slangster's gat
Two hit Tucker, she labeled it gangster rap
Unseen curve, struck the vital nerve
Of some sort, courts got papers to serve
Still bang 'em in the head, just lead, no eraser
One shot, no chaser, who ya replacer

Showing off your Rolex,

I'm black and proud, I move the crowd
I'm raised from Hell, yo
My lyrics alone rock the bell!
Of those who say that its me they wanna scar

So, come in the game and project the hard image
But they can't never get past the line of scrimmage
'Cause I'm on a defense, what a tough sequence
And you lack the knowledge to understand a pretense
So, just from not planning it right, you got sacked
By a blitz of rhymes that was broken down in stacks
Therefore, the mic was hyped but then your hand
Got stripped and ripped while it slipped from its stand
Then what happened? You begin to cease to control it
You fumbled, couldn't rumble, so then I stole it
How did you think you could make first down?
If you were boxing, you wouldn't escape the first round
Save the bull, don't even begin to waste time, drop the mic
Before you reach fate, then you rhyme and realize
You were just weak from the start
You make demos, but really don't master the art
I know ya know deep down inside you can't flow
Plus, you're backwards, when I said red, you said ""Go!""
But you should've stopped, because the red was the bloodshed
But you ignored the warning and you went ahead
You tried me, G, by setting up a match
A fair one, meaning no strings attached, then bang!",https://genius.com/Gza-1991-freestyle-lyrics
Silent,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"Yeah, six o'clock in the morning
That's right, you gotta get your darts right
Spray ya'll niggas on some marksman shit]

I got rid of the grays
Took my hat off and the crowd went crazy
Bitches threw their panties, the sound man was fannin' me
The whole place was standin', G
What they chant, we was family
Jumped in the crowd and I swam the sea
Threw me to the back, surprise, I still had my chains on me
Dana Dane, front row bitches, I bang all three
Say, yo, Math, fuck it, throw on Jim Browski
Versace, banana color robes and my socks be
Them Billie Jean shits and they real rocky
The fans can't knock me
I bench Coliseums while Genius spot me
Plus I'm cocky, bitch

Once I, took off the hoodie, revealed the face
Cop patrol couldn't control the place
I got groupies backstage, lined up at the gate
The signs up, yellin', ""We love your tape!""
I'm sorry I took so long, didn't mean to make ya'll wait
But good things take time to create
You can find me, in your studio
Half baked, eatin' ganja cake
Tryin' to make my next release date
With Ghost, Street, GZA, great minds relate
You know a brother bond is hard to break
When we perform we cause the Earth to shake
Ain't nuthin' change, it's still those same niggas you love to hate
GZA...

I set examples over amplified samples
That's scratched in the club, ducks begin to trample
On those who fell victim, body loss they souls
These beats when I picked 'em
Jones played the role, soldiers, brave and bold
RZA paid the roll, GZA buries the scrolls
Then months later it was, then years later it was
Written on loose leaf, that old formula
That was stolen by new thieves
The journalist watched it, critics couldn't knock it
A piece of history that they carried in their pocket
With the time factor, speed was the order of the day
What a delay, they were able to, what he would say
Why waste the slot time, of the ridiculous rhyme
That's only excused by a generous mind
I kept 'em stored in the shelters like the goods in cans
'Til I turned rap fields into harvested lands",https://genius.com/Gza-silent-lyrics
7 Pounds,Pro Tools,2010.0,"Speaking of this artform, the slang is dangerous
MC's are like sperm cells, a gang of us
Fighting to reach the egg, biting and lose a leg
Odds are like 1 to 10 million, the kin thread
One from a thousand speaks in his own voice
The other 999, imitates without choice
They never even knowing it, until the going gets rough
You see the Amplified Sample I'm throwing with
I grab the microphone, the unthinkable happens
See the rockets red glare like the guns when clapping
They still cage matching MC's thats scrapping
Not the UFC, but my opponent is tapping
So don't let a little bit of fear turn to hatred
I was sent as a savior to revive what was sacred
Also stop this uncalled for behavior
Insipid back cats, they lack taste and flavor

Got word from the wise to let it drop
Set this on fire, take aim and let it pop
Because regardless to whom or what, even the door shut
I'm giving 'em straight raw, you bringing them all cut
Like Bolivian rock, your watered down hip hop
Raps so out of shape and far from tip top
Pearls next to pebbles, spoons against shovels
Dictators next to rebels, and Gods against devils

No time for backwards thinking, let's think ahead
If you want to sleep when you awake then make your bed
Alotta MC's came to see me on referals
Not even knowing that they would undergo great perils
These cutting edge methods from the most specialized
Faster than the last men, and before the dust'll fly
The lord of the art, strikes a chord in your heart
Your ear love to hear the God, ripping tracks apart
Me to hip hop, is like Einstein to science
A match made in heaven, most likely an alliance
Complex individual that you dream of being
Intellectual challenging, the all eye seeing
Got an appetite for heat, so then come and bite the beat
And digest the rest and don't stress the part you couldn't eat",https://genius.com/Gza-7-pounds-lyrics
"High Price, Small Reward",Beneath the Surface,1999.0,"I wiped the chrome off with the dustcloth 'fore I bust off
What's the cost, life loss?
High price to pay for a small reward
Kill for that Bushwick and Horsely broad
I provided the jumper cables through the booster mini-packs
Based on the drama unfolding in the track
I don't hold back, I spare no one
Swords swing like shogun, now who want it?
You see the truth, then act upon it
Or feel the fire's full view
Ain't a MC that I hit can pull through
Y'all niggas are like kids, flashing plastic tools
Unaware of the multi-year dynastic rule
What?! Stupid!

Without a doubt, it's in the heart
Where the best darts were written
Sitting at the window of the Grand Old Earths
Youths thirst for knowledge, I teach but hold heat
'Cause some savage niggas are lost beyond reach
Broken homes breed seeds of no guidance
Left to wander the streets and experiment with devilishment
Violent, felon offenders, supreme folders
One-twenty bomb holders let 'em off and explode
The battlefield haunting, the daunting
Wu-Tang dance, deadly emits six pence
Spiral, rifle barrel pointed, elastic noose
Plastic head wrap stifle, survival
Tribal, title - Secret Rival
Article subliminal message throwing
Bitch niggas hoeing on labels
Mic cables, capable of slowing down jets on deck
Fucking you straight through continuously
Justice, the war of the critical penital
Some long overdue, now served by the chiefs on cheat
Drama builds, it's the street prophecies fulfilled
Bitter chill currents to the invited
Bang for the phones, live niggas on their way home
Snatch poems from clones, we got it sewn",https://genius.com/Gza-high-price-small-reward-lyrics
Life of a Drug Dealer,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"There's a rumor that an old lady heard a
Kingpin hiring a hitman to murder
A federal prosecuting drug-dealing witness
But that's how it is in the business
And I'm in it, physically gaining power
Constantly counting up cash by the hour
And it feels good to be paid
Regardless of how many victims get slayed
Accomplices of mine drop like flies
But in this, every day a homeboy dies
Whether shot in the body or 
cyanide in ya Bacardi
'Cause it's a cutthroat party
Now it's up to me to retaliate
And if I score, I'll increase the murder rate
I move on ones who double-cross
Set them up, now they suffer the loss
Of he or she who's ever on the agenda
Most likely a family member
Informants, rattle-tattle-telling snakes
Get shot up, brutalized and thrown in lakes
The parts of a body is found days later
The other half was done by an amputator
I'm undefeated in plenty fights
My enemies are beaten with many stripes
I'll shoot up funerals, firebomb wakes
Vehicular homicides, whatever it takes
Just to keep control of my empire
I'll set ya own mother on fire
'Cause when it comes down just to me and my money
Ain't a fucking thing funny
All those who pose a threat I'll stick them
Ya friends, ya family, and innocent victims
Get caught in the midst when I'm busting of nines
But they was in the wrong place, the wrong time
Decapitated bodies found in lots
While I'm still cooking up kilos in pots
The kilos becomes bricks and the bricks becomes rocks
Then retailed on the blocks
I drive around in expensive cars
And get women who fuck like porno stars
I get them high, you know, like powder they nose
Then put 'em in the streets as my high-class hoes
I'm wild, living foul and I'm ruthless
I leave muthafuckers toothless
I had a worker who stepped on the scene lively
Then started selling my customers Ivory
Soap, counterfeit vials of cracks
I stuck 'em to death with a thousand thumbtacks
You've seen my resume, that's just the half
I'm a bad muthafucker, just like Shaft
A character played by who? Richard Roundtree
The only difference, my guns are sound-free
Silencers ring off then wisp by
Then all you hear is a last-minute cry
Of those who tried to control my territory
Not the West Side but the Bed-Stuy story
Police be giving me eye-to-eye contact
But I smile cause I'm putting out contracts
Now a G-note is placed upon ya head
You say picture that? Alright
Bang ya dead
This is the life of a drug dealer",https://genius.com/Gza-life-of-a-drug-dealer-lyrics
Cinema,Pro Tools,2008.0,"There was a clubhouse, owners kept special guests in
Place much darker than the room I rest in
Creepy spot where the dust covers the floor
And some fishing rods is hanging on the door
Painting on the wall of stick figures
That's rumored to walk out the frame and get bigger
Where the imagination runs wild, like who's creeping
Neighbors are acres away and probably sleeping
Wind that's blowing makes the sounds of ghost
Thieves in the room makes you feel really close
Remind me of this late night thriller
I watched the other night, they never caught the killer
Bats that's flying in every direction
Got to stay low and roll with the protection
Visitors that often stay for the summer
They heart beat, like the roll of a drummer

I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real

The moon was full, the sky was black, the bathroom
Hear a crack, wolves roam in packs
In the dining room, a chair rock back and forth
Pulled the table cloth 'til the silverware fell off
Cups and glass plates hit the floor and shattered
Three Blind Mice heard the noise and scattered
Front door was open, welcome mat was soaking
The blood of Christ, plus all four locks were broken
In the backyard, two dogs would growling
They're barking, the eyes and they teeth was sparkling
I started to sweat, they started to get closer
Then I saw a face on a wanted poster
An outlaw who stayed with an empty holster
Used to shoot mugs of beer off the coaster
Make a move to turn the light switch on
Jump up, my jacket was torn
Pages from the photo album begin to turn
Wax dripped from the candle as it slowly burned
Then the lights had started blinking, as if the power was gone
The room become foggy, as if the shower was on
Words was written in the steam on the mirror
In bold print, couldn't have been any clearer
TV was giving out sounds without a picture
And a voice kept saying ""I'mma getcha""

I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, I got those chills
I can feel the presence all around me
The scene isn't funny, it's all too real",https://genius.com/Gza-cinema-lyrics
Short Race,Pro Tools,2008.0,"He's running in a short race, shoelace untied
Head down, facial expression he can't hide
Kid with no direction, seems confused
A victim who spent years, being abused
His moms a drug addict, she has a bug habit
Was a Seventh Day Adventist who celebrated the Sabbath
But she back slid, or that's what the crack did
She used to shoot up, under her sleeves, the track hid
A long time ago, the father left the picture
And as time went on, he was erased from the scripture
The son, he don't have much to treasure
And these kids that be getting on him, they do it for pleasure
Demons are gradually growing inside him
Way before he ever knew the courts would divide him
A wall around himself had became a shell
Was a whole new person, by the time the bricks fell

It's a short race, duck the court dates
The pork gave chase, we had to walk straight
You know the forte, nigga it's a portrait
Or should I say a poor trait
You want to store very short cake
Estate, behind the gate
N.Y. State, why wait?
You trying to get paid by the lake
In each state, and do the shit at high pace

Under the dirt, there was nothing left but bones
A lot of tall grass around his tombstone
His mother left alone, her heart felt sorrow
No time to play with the precious time we borrow
They live next door, but he was worlds away
In reality, but such a high price to pay
He was easy to recognize from his dress code
Nothing but a firework about to explode
A short fuse, who was bound to lose in the struggle
His grandparents went through a great deal of trouble
To keep him out of jail, they even put they house on sale
To post bail, but the kid still failed
I remember when he called collect from behind bars
Suffering from two injuries and nine scars
He said he'd give anything to be out the pen
But it would be his permanent home until the end


Wait, I got to get mines
With a side of French fries, not kid sized
Sixes fives, I give off a pimp's vibe
Is it the vines? Watch like a sitcom
Throwing rocks with my pitching arm
More bricks than when the Knicks is on
, I'm sitting on
Shitting on your boss, been written off
Shots I'm licking off, the top like a different source
Ripping this raw like a kitchen chore
That's a block not chicken broth
Hold the pot with your mittens on
Dicks kicking in the door, and went to pick me off like a lintball
Jumped out the fifth floor it's a pit fall
When I hit the lawn, shit it fell like a jigsaw
Rather get hit at the board, then to get tossed
Went to court, got shipped off like a brick of soft",https://genius.com/Gza-short-race-lyrics
Luminal,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"This is a tale of a town with the population
Of approximately two thousand people
A small close-knit community where crime
And murder were virtually unheard of
Where front doors were always left unlocked
A place where mayhem only happens in your wildest dreams

For some, the sun will never come out tomorrow
Like those in this heart-pounding tale of random horror
Of a body count, after trashin' it, they done with it
Victims inflicted with passionate punishment
Specific offers of horrific torture
That left crime scenes, that retired law enforcers
His ruthlessness knew no bounds, as he beat him down
Shot him while gagged and bound, kept the whole town
Shocked, with they doors locked, fire arms cocked
Major roads blocked, no one knows when he knocks
As a kid he killed three pets of an attorney
So his childhood passion became a lifelong journey
Grew into a world of destruction, abduction
Left many body parts flowin' on the Hudson
Whether fountain or ditch, after the ride you hitched
Screams was high pitched from scars you can't stitch
Mutilated and decapitated, white-collar chicks
Just from his involvement in local politics
His outfit stained with the blood of the slain
While his backyard full of skeletal remains
His goal in life, was preparation for death
An autopsy showed asphyxiation, loss of breath
Was it his fascination, for strangulation
The lynchings in the 20's was his inspiration
Unspeakable acts that made front page
Motivated by an unexplainable rage

""A suspected killer plaguing this community
Has once again eluded police and detectives""
""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""
""This nameless, faceless murderer
Has killed a couple, execution style, in their own home
Smashed a 12-year old Little League ball player skull, with a baseball bat""
""We have no leads, no photos, no suspects""

The State psychologist, forensic pathologist
Warned the detective to search beyond the obvious
They ruled out the possibility that the killer be
Physically fit with athletic ability
Talley and murder, on his agenda
There was no word in his code for ""surrender""
So when the headlines had announced the arrest, the repercussion
Was his trial became a lightning rod for discussion
Compellin' evidence, statements from residents
Validated guilt as he maintained his innocence
From the hair to the fiber, broke the bondage wire
The stains on the carpet consisted with saliva
DNA directly linked to the psycho
Luminal made it glow, was test to Type 0
For many years, a lot of murders went unsolved
A lot of blood resolve as guns still revolve
The bullets had names that made the frames shatter
Most savage massacre that made the brains scatter
Detectives astounded by the scope of the crime
Made a hard discovery from one of many signs
While questionin' a man he picked up on a scanner
He reacted in a loud and agitated matter
And once they tried to read him his rights
He turned cold as ice",https://genius.com/Gza-luminal-lyrics
Feel Like an Enemy,Beneath the Surface,1999.0,"Yeah, yeah yo
I'm like a whirlwind spinnin wit words of wisdom
In the ghetto only promised a hearse and system
We complete like the solar system
Play your space, I get hungry off of treble and bass and beat breaks
Everyday be a court date recorded on tape
Hell Razah grab the mic and send your show to a wake
Cut off a snakehead the same way I cut off dead weight
We negotiate wit .38's in a north face
GZA came wit the Liquid Swords killin you all
I'm the virus in the street that'll get in your paws
See me jumpin outta four-doors wit my road dogs
All you soldiers want wars when you don't know laws
You be a rap fraud, knock you off the top of Billboard
Besides keyboards, only thing I love is the Lord
G-G, Maccabees, K-P be backin' me
Aiyyo Prodigal, niggas is charged wit blasphemy
Chorus 
AND ALL THAT HARD ROCK SHIT (charged wit blasphemy)
AND IF YOU'RE FEELIN LIKE AN ENEMY (come after me)

I heard the sweet words from sour tongues
Vent poison in the ears of the ?grown-z's? dead head for years
Shed a tear for the underwear under the stairs
Left naked in the shame from hunger and fear
Shots were fired in the darkest moments
Niggas missed they targets, hit the homeless when the chrome spit
Sacreligious, days of atonement
Sing a praise wit a peace pipe for niggas I zone wit
Priest I blow bread amongst twelve thugs
Drunk a cup of blood
We trained the same time Peter sprayed a slug
We all trapped in this dream scared to wake up
I seen a phantom whisper, grim shadows, shows a blurry picture
Streets are filled wit goons and bloody niggas
I seen my friend fall, clutchin holdin his stomach
Caught him off-guard, foldin his hundred
It's like a life never ends, never know when it's comin

Vocal imbalance, a code of silence converses violent
Live from medalion, ?nometry? dealin equality
You could stop to see profiles of me
Mic styles of me, lifestyles of me
Parallel prophecy, three-sixty degree
Complete the formation, salute the salvation
A Wu nation, do the knowledge no hatin
No misbehavin, lyrical affiliation
Artist in occupation together maintainin
Brain stainin, metaphor mutilatin
This generation, a misleading calculation
No elevation, time wastin and live chasin

A day and night crime scene, livin in the time machine
Blaze a lime green, six on the spleen over some green
Surrounded by crooks, a life wit jux and bloody heist
It's a deadly price but the gun fiend for ice price
In this hell puzzle filled wit bitches, money and trouble
Stitches, for dummy knuckles crummy fuckin up the hustle
It's a struggle, in jungle wit sin we fondle men
Plus a prison, ain't no division and no religion
And inner city chronicle, thugs get caught up astronomical
Stash phenomenal, blast at your abdominal
Niggas is comical, fuckin wit the abominal
Son, I promise you, you won't live to see tomorrow
Catch a slug in the back of your head at the Apollo
I'm a hard act to follow, rugged Smith like Rollo

Groundbreaking,Pro Tools,2008.0,"I'm in the schoolyard rhyming with my brother Jamel and Ra' Allah
Vibe and took the beat, and imagining how far
The sound travel at the turn of the volume
It could shake the gravel, before we heard the loud boom
It vibrated through the parking lot
Shattered a few windshields, set off a sparking shot
The local UPS cat, but we didn't stress that
He had a slow leak, front tire almost flat
I got a cousin think he slicker than the oil in the chain
But I live in an arcade, surrounded by game
He used to pass me bucks, trying gas me up
He was a fast talker, and he kept a flashy cut
From a spot that was on Malcolm X Boulevard
Where this magician, wishing I would pull a card
An optical illusion, and whose hands were quick
But wasn't fast enough not to reveal his trick

Who be the first to set it off and just begun
Turn up the heat until the track is done
And we roll together as one
Yes, I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one

Mass hysteria inside the cafeteria
Not a food fight, but the news might beat your area
Whether by word of mouth, or if you read about it
Extra extra, they felt the need to shout it
The drummer played the beat on the table
His boy kicked a verse, like he was the first and I wasn't able
More prepared to let off anything substantial
If I had no rhymes and my planes was cancelled
Picture that, before you give your bag and expose it
Couldn't develop the color, wonder why he chosed it
See less than the worst competition, to the point
I only use one ear to listen
Was it something I'm missing the food is getting cold
The corners about to flake as soon as I flip the bowl
See the rhyme ain't worth the lunch ticket
Waste of time of mine plus the temp kicked it

Who be the first to set it off and just begun
Turn up the heat until the track is done
And we roll together as one
Yes, I call my brother son 'cause he shine like one",https://genius.com/Gza-groundbreaking-lyrics
Words From A Genius,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"* slight variation between the original and the re-release in song title

One two one two check one two
The Genius in the place to be

I make the mic pump my mic makes the party jump
And poison beats make hip-hoppers stomp
Their feet kinda wild, to give off sparks
But I'll still light it up when the place is pitch dark
Now that you witnessed me this get this correct, rap wreck
When I'm speaking it's the God projecting
Facts into brains of those unaware
Now you're facing the truth in the square
Biters like biting, then yo you should chew this
Your man wants to beef, then we can do this
Then when it's time for you to face the God
I'll be giving you the whole nine yards
With lyrics that breaks the laws of gravity
So sweet to biters it gives them cavities
And can't be healed from the strongest toothpaste
So keep biting to see how the truth taste
You need guidance and self-assistance
Cause you lack the training to go the distance
But I'll rhyme, to the fullest length
And this is just a fraction of the strength

Of the Genius
Words from a Genius

I'll never sweat an MC then say I wanna be him
Cause he makes a hit records and flips a coliseum
I learn to lead myself, not be a follower
I'm not a biter, stupid rhyme swallower
I created something funky fresh funky new
Brothers started playing monkey see and monkey do
Should I explain hip-hop, okay I love it
Simple definition but ya still don't know the half of it
All I need is a mic, a beat, then I'll step free
And flip like I'm bugging off Bacardi and Pepsi
Dancers on stage like Alvin Ailey
While I'm deep into the roots like Alex Haley
You wanna try me, and be worn and torn
Step forward, I'll get on and start to born
A pumpin self explanator rap
Make a sucker MC like you clap
Your hands, while you clap the sound's intact
You react like an infant response to Similac
Or then again, could have been Enfamil
But for your information the rhyme is real
MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just One Nation Under
A Groove, getting down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the business for the junk of it
When I'm premitted to break down a poem
I'm like knotty hair rippin out teeth from a comb
One by one so who you calling your troops on
Ya couldn't even bust a grape, with spike boots on
Biters are crooks and try to steal the stage
I read em like books, flip em and turn the page
I'm The Genius, you're living in deep fear
Go home and write and come try me next year
With stacks of rhymes or you'll be feelin ill troop
You being stuck in the ice cream and didn't know the scoop


Some say The Genius, has a style of his own
And his hands are like Vice-Grips holdin a microphone
Flowin smooth, with rhymes that are rough
Because I can't get enough
So I practice not what I preach but what I teach
In which the critics say is improper speech
But it's proper, only to those who understand
Why I walk on stage with a mic in my hand
As brothers look on, label me as a psycho
Just because I'll jump on stage and grab a micro-phone
From a so-called said to be MC
Who admires me with jealousy and envy
My rhymes are delivered with style and potential
Words are flowin smoothly in a sequential
Order, revealin hidden tape recorders
Stuffed inside pockets and those I'll slaughter
But I don't get upset, when you bite and steal
I go home and write some ill
Stacks of poetry, page after page
Imagining the scen-ery onstage
I catch flash-backs of the seminar
As I crush the dreams of a wannabe star
Self-explanatory words are shifted
In a unbitten style cause I'm gifted
And talented, with the lyrical ability
Bound to fuck up a hip-hop facility
Damaging MC's who dare to enter
The center, then challenge the inventor
Of an impartial rhymin status
Followed a relevant apparatus
The way I come off on the mic is attractive
I can make a quadriplegic hyperactive
With lyrics of friction causing mics to spark
My style couldn't be bitten by a shark
MC's don't understand the way I be bombin em
Roll up and ask me what's the phenomenon
First of all homeboy when I'm battlin
I'm like a doctor shootin deadly insulin
Into MC's like that of a syringe
And dare you to seek for revenge",https://genius.com/Gza-words-from-a-genius-lyrics
What Are Silly Girls Made Of,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"What are silly girls made of, made of
What are silly girls made of
A neck full of gold, material things huh
That's what silly girls are made of

On a scale of one to ten, I seen a girl about a nine
A slave of mental death, if only she was divine
Walking down my ex-block, the block Monroe
I said, peace to her, the girl said hello
Well hell is low and the lowest you can go
Is thirty-two degrees, below zero
So I started to rain on this young girl's brain
Causin her a great mass of physical pain
She said, ""Tit for tat, step off my bra strap
No diamonds, no gold, you cannot get a rap.""
Then I said, ""So what?"", as I grabbed her butt
She smiled for a while but her mouth kept shut
The girl is eighteen, just birthed a child
You're young in the brain and your thoughts are wild
You're on welfare, yo but you don't care
You say, ""FTF is always there.""
Yes FTF meaning face-to-face
The main headquarters of your local place
Where you collect your bi-weekly pay
To support the foolish habits you abuse every day

What are silly girls made of, made of
What are silly girls made of
""Yeah that's right, I'm juicin em, I'm juicin em dry!""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

There has never been a dame in my entire life
My girlie, my ex, my next or my wife
There has never been one who tried to disrespect
Especially a member of the opposite sex
Yo bust it, there's somethin that I gotta let out
But I don't want to be known as Ralph the Blabbermouth
Silly girls, they think guys are soft
But all they wanna do, is knock their boots off
And just from obtaining the common sense
You can tell that the girlies seem rather quite dense
Other than dense, they play slightly bold
But from the statements I made they could not uphold theyself
They break down, and they start to cry and said
""Oh! I don't believe this guy!""

Now what are silly girls made of, made of
What are silly girls made of
""It's all about the finances"" ""Forget the romance""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
What are silly girls made of, made of
What are silly girls made of
""Guys with cash"" ""can rock my big ass""
Is that what silly girls are made of?

Silly girls on a strip, struttin back and forth
Watchin cars, thinkin of G'n off
Lookin for gentlemen, who they might swing
And attitudes, like you can get anything
You wear tight bodysuits under long coats
But ain't satisfied until a pervert slice your throat
You're young, you're dumb, and you used to be innocent
When young, now take a look at what you've become
A bloodsucker, trying to get all you can
Out the pocket of the next girl's man
Just to clothe yourself in gold and jewelry
You wear tight jeans with attempts to lure me
Into your web, cause you're livin like a spider
And playin it off, like everything's Ore-Ida
You come out late at night and roam the streets
Like thiefs, stalkin a piece of flesh meat
Is that what you do for a living get paid?
C'mon, there's plenty of ways to get paid
But instead of living the life that's clean and sturdy
You'd rather go out and get your knees dirty

What are silly girls made of, made of
What are silly girls made of
""He better buy me some gold bamboozles"" ""And some Fendi too""
Is that what silly girls are made of?
What are silly girls made of, made of
What are silly girls made of

First of all, don't leave home without it
Without what?
The gold card
I'm tryin to tell you now
I don't lay on my back for free
You know as they say
If you want a good lay
Ya gots ta pay

Yo what's up gorgeous, what's your name?
Baby let's talk about your assets first
Alright baby, well let's go for a ride in my new car
What kind of car you drivin baby?
I got a new Yugo
A Yugo? C'mere
You go, get in your Yugo
And get on out of here!
Girlfriend, tell him about hisself
I don't believe him, he got champagne thoughts and Bud Light money
Bud Light money? A Yugo? A thirty-five hundred dollar car?
And you stepping to this? I take only Benzes and better love
Forget about the love it's all about the money

Path of Destruction,Pro Tools,2008.0,"He was raised in a house, where he got scarce attention
Twisted, yet methodical mind, not to mention
Circus like atmosphere, story book upbringing
Neighborhood full of married couples who loved swinging
Preacher lived life, he spent it in the spotlight
A teacher was his wife who was stabbed and shot twice
They attended a church, where they both were active
And a little bit of rope, he gave others attracted
He rule with the iron hand, if the meal wasn't hot enough
Then he'll swing the frying pan
Heavy as the hammer of Thor
You know he suffer from the consequences
Of broken vowels and law
A convicted felon for armed robbery
At the time where he had sank into deep poverty
Forsaken by his mother and father, Christ achieving the talent
He attended the sheet on the path of destruction

And these prisons held yesterdays juvenile delinquents
Convicts who entered crime, even before they entered puberty (on the path of
Destruction)
They remember how old I was when I first got in trouble
Me? Around nine, nah, six, seven

He ended up on the block with kid scooters and ice cream
But in and out of foster homes, until he was 19
Stealing for food and didn't do for enjoyment
At the time of lay off, shut down and unemployment
He moved into a new world, to seek his fortune
And suited himself to the times with extortions
A hustle that was ruled by men and murder
He earned enough for his daily bread and wanted to move further
He knew no good, could come from such a sin
Had issues as a kid, so he held it all within
And he pursued the game so hotly, on a path of destruction
Even though the road was rocky
Very caught up in his own drive for dominance
And to know that he would pay in the end was common sense
Some say he had a long deserved death
And then he felt relieved when they were told he left

These young civilians move to an assault and battery
Plus, mortal techniques, breaking and entering, burglary
Purse snatching (on the path of destruction)
Shoplifting, hand graffiti, crash and stolen property
Possessing and distribution of narcotics
Illegal possession of weapon, assaulting a police officer
Larceny (on the path of destruction)",https://genius.com/Gza-path-of-destruction-lyrics
Uncut Material,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"What you know about emceein? (I know a lot)
Can you demonstrate something? (Why not?)
I'm speaking about stacks, GZA (That's all I got)
The raw un-cut material (That's all I drop)

The nucleus of hip hop, rap's hallmark
They had a citywide effort to keep us in the dark
To the new details, distant wisp of light
Evidence of a terrifying threats on microphone
Rhyme stone, numerous parts combine
Strands of heavy metal form the steel arch design
Fit together seamlessly, everlasting rap
Heat-pressure generated by a blasted cap
The chamber when ya rollin' the dice everything count
Clan royalty where the loyalty is paramount
Couldn't be more wrong prior to your pursuing
When ya spoke of us, you understated the influence
As I bury my motor-action, implode a fraction
Of ya investigation when ya askin
Aware about in ya suit and tie, cruising by
The intrepid workmen that sharpen ya shooting eye


Like a child I have infinite patience when I write
The victim's dental records showed they loved to bite
The under like removed off a charged battery
Someone had his ear stuffed wit the sweets of flattery
A live wire, fired the shot in the booth
It wasn't even in the shooting distance of truth
Who broke the barrier causing mass hysteria?
At the darkest hour in the most densed area
In a stocking cap, undercover, while disguising
I'm rapidly advancing our horizons
This path of trade with the sharp blade, open to all across the globe
They simply heard my call
We hit up, the remote and primitive land
Left walking reminders that saw it first-hand
The music was a secure link we all think
On the same page as holding the ink, now whatchu think?",https://genius.com/Gza-uncut-material-lyrics
Columbian Ties,Pro Tools,2008.0,"What goes around, comes around
In his own iniquity he died, through columbian ties
Fated back to the essence
Still forced to learn a lesson
All debts must be settled, no question

The echo from machine gun rounds simmers
A fallen soldier, his gun hangs on his shoulders, lights get dimmer
Key swinging back and forth on the ignition
The stench is only part of the horrible condition
As he waits for the smoke to clear, all he heard was the blast
From the bomb, that kept ringing in his ear
Along with gun bearing troops, fatigues and wearing boots
From far away, whether night or day, you hear 'em shoot
It's a very unforgiving and hostile environment
Where military hardware is the only requirement
A world where the deceased is just a thing of the past
And each and every advance is more costly than the last
A President's madness, responsible for losses
Political forces, land littered with corpses
Like the youth in the street, who gamble and gets scarred
Even the troops in the field, bet it all on one card
Some question their reason for being here
Facing incredible odds and a recession that's so severe
Raised in the shadow of a terrible loss
And the atmosphere, even breathing air can cost
A place where the majority is going for self
With the agenda not far beyond, personal wealth
It's like, either you eat, or you die from hunger
Starving to death, until the coroner calls your number
With no bread to bite or break from off the table
The caskets had exceeded the number of cradles
When it's dark, danger falls across the plateau
Unmasking your deceit, in the streets that sat low
These stomping grounds are known to bring misfortune
Fueled by his obsessions, he murder for portions
And died from of a misreable death, his final undoing
His biggest downfall was from the people he left

What goes around, comes around
In his own iniquity he died, through columbian ties
Fated back to the essence
Still forced to learn a lesson
All debts must be settled, no question",https://genius.com/Gza-columbian-ties-lyrics

Live, yeah, what yo

My clan is like USA the way we conquer
Lay back, grow more chocolate than Willy Wonka
Stomp ya, till your head bleed, your mouth bleed
Running wit the heart of slave that's been freed
Triple Darkness, wild like a killer from Spofford
Heartless, trained to hit moving targets
Profit, .357 cock it
Kill you, leave you wit your money in your pocket
My logic - money, bitches, land and lessons
Allah blesses, me wit automatic weapons

Running through Medina wit the Glock plastic
Rotten fruit, Black Je-sus, I got juice
Darkman move swift as a mongoose

Yo, niggas caught plaque from biting off the platinum
Dumb MCs caught the gum disease, ask them
Who style they took, two wild rooks

Rough Cut,Legend of the Liquid Sword,2002.0,"Uh-huh, GZA, uh, RZA, uh

Listen, if ya'll can spit, we can spit, please get it together
Cuz anything you can do, I can do better
Your imagine material looks, hidin behind hooks
Raise the fear, no one, but self, who's shook?
Bring the plague like the revelations in the holy book
Who's spot youse took? Duke off the hook!
I'm from the land of the crook, life quick to end
Better known as the Brook, rather take than lend
There's a lot of wack records, but this ain't one of them
DJ's off the books, go 'head put the gun at them
All groupie M.C.'s, I'm bout to start stunnin' 'em
Don't matter what crew, every last one of 'em
It's gettin' crowded in here, some acts got to go
Let's start by eliminatin' groups that can't flow
I bet a mil' my deal, my career with no fear
That none of ya'll, duke, can touch what's over here

These rough cut metal tapes
Quick to break your label mates, won't hesitate
Negotiate your table stakes, you can't flow right
Or fuck with me on no night
Fuck the slow light, you need to get your show right

Yo Justice, how many M.C.'s must get pistol whipped?
Crack faces with bottles of Crys', hollow tips gobble lips
That's the penalty for poppin' that shit
Vanish in a colorless whip, bags of grip
Doo-rags and clips, tag the strip
You had the chance to advance, I'm sorry for the holes in
Your hip
Son, It's the way of the street merchant, live by the laws
Die by the rules
My gleam play the part of a fool
Now hear these jewels from a wise king, see what my eyes seen
Ten year supreme, the theme, we sizzle-line and triple CREAM
My grip'll off that digital bream, visual scene
Roll footage on your video screen
Globe patrol, Two On The Road, we never fold
Snub react, GZA mack eliminate tracks
Stimulate phat, Sunzini, nigga, gifted and black
Now watch me mack to the kingdom of rap

Give me a beat, nigga dealin' battles like a thief
Done killed more niggas than Jason in part 3
Stay Wu, own the graveyard and this label
Dum dums, that battle 12 O'Clock, now it's able
So what, looked up and made the bitches clap
That was because my style's clothes, not the raps
Ain't that shit, props for the clothing
Should of brought a mirror, cuz lyric wasn't rollin'
My rhymes is all that and yours ain't shit
And at a party, your bitch takin' crazy flicks of me
She said I was nigga celebrity
But I'm from the slums, with the bums drinkin' Hennesey
Take a sip of some Jamaican rum
Put fire to my lung, tongue, teeth and gums
When it comes out my mouth, shit's hot and it burns
Make fools out of bitches like I'm Howard Stern",https://genius.com/Gza-rough-cut-lyrics
True Fresh M.C.,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"I rock the mic at any party
And in the place to be
I'm a true, true fresh MC
I'm a true fresh MC

I work real hard to achieve my goal
From building and bringing out my true inner soul
Which was once on a downfall and then uplifted
So why live life foul when you're talented and gifted
I've changed, rearranged my total direction
Searchin' for happiness, seeking for perfection
Living the true life, a real story
To make you realize the truth, not scream Glory
Glory, hallelujah, not here to fool ya
But to replenish your souls as I school ya
With a greeting of Purified Education
Always Correcting Errors which stops the temptation
Of you doing wrong singing the same sad song
Renewing bad histories for how long
A long, long time ago
Going for mind made The Genius a pro
And as you see who I be
I be The Genius and I'm a true M.C

Now who rocks the mic at any party
And in the place to be
Yo we have a Genius, a true fresh MC
A true fresh MC

Brothers need to study some lessons
They are the blessings to keep you from guessing
The questions that is asked by the seeker
Put on the beat and let me born it through the speaker
Peace, a lot of MC's like to say it
And some that advocate it they just spray it
Out and scream and shout, beyond the shadow of a doubt
They don't know what it's about
Just to keep you informed with the significance
How can I prove this through true evidence
Some make me laugh, think they droppin' math
Show and prove is a difficult path
In the five percent, I am the live percent
Those who perpetrate are the jive percent
I be the universal, the Biochemical
Arm, Leg, Leg, Arm, Head is the physical
That keeps rhymin' until it's unbearable
No individual is comparable
You have a problem inform the technician
But he's not dealing with those of superstition
Those who like dealing with it superstitiously
Cross your fingers when you steppin' to me
I don't need beefs and problems, riffs and static
Debates and arguments, that's not dramatic
I need action, it speaks louder than a word
Especially when the word is loud and unheard
Word is what? My word is bond, your word is bull'
Now it's your card I'm gonna pull

Now who rocks the mic at any party
And in the place to be

Superfreak,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"I hopped on the train and cold clocked a chick
Who looked good as hell but she appeared to be sick
I would say she had to look as if she swallowed a worm
Then again she could've swallowed several ounces of sperm
Giving me the eye as if I was the right antidote
So I decided to swing a smooth episode
While the train stopped at Grand Central turn
Before I knew her name I was massaging her perm
I said, ""My you look drunk, have you been drinking alcohol?
You got a fever here's an Extra Strength Tylenol""
She said, ""Great a comedian, comic""
She leaned on me, I said, ""Please don't vomit!""
She said, ""I'm not I just need some rest""
I said, ""A few more stops, The Genius house is best""
Got to my rest, her whole attitude change
But deep inside, she seemed sexually strange
Went in the room and she flopped on the bed
With wild-ass thoughts inside her headachish head
I went in the kitchen to prepare some food
When I came back in she was completely nude
I know it sounds weak but believe it or not
That the fever in her head ran straight to her twat
She was burning! Burning up out
It took more, than firemen, to put that out
And yo, I was hard, just as hard as a rock
That I can hit a home run, with my cock
She said, ""Let me show you what we do uptown
I huff and I puff till I blow your balls down""
Wild as a wolf from off Wilderness Ave
She said, ""My what a great big ahhh! you have""
I started dripping and dripping in consecutive terms
I know we must save water but that does not include sperm

Did you ever know a girlie who just loves to switch
From a part-time lover to a part-time bitch
While she's loving part-time, she's riding on mine
She says, ""I love you long as you keep making me feel fine!""
In her behind, vagina, or heated climax
That I would sew, control, finger then wax
Now she's swingin so low, yo, she flex like wrecks
Cuz she can set records on oral sex
There's no lie what I said, she lives in the bed
If she got married, she'd be a worn-out newlywed
And if she heard these words yo she would not cry
Because sperm, the only damn tears in her eye
Her drip-drop face is the one I painted
Just stared in her eyes while she damn near fainted
As she choked, goggled, then spit-up
'Cause cream was flowing all over her cup
On the bathroom floor 'cause her parents were home
And I just couldn't tolerate her moans and groans
""Genius, oh Genius, oh rock me so hard!
'Cause I don't want to stop, I love you God!""
But there's one thing she could never erase
That the thing she really wanted just sprayed in her face
So she regret, she ever swung low before
But this little hot bitch comes swinging for more
It used to be one, now it's five fingers of death
That rips her insides, as she gasp for breath
To say, ""I love you! I love you! Forever so!
I'm getting hot, getting hot, let me blow, let me blow""
What she thought was love, turned out to be lust
That made her live by the laws, in sex we trust",https://genius.com/Gza-superfreak-lyrics
Phony As Ya Wanna Be,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"When I hold a mic in my hand, it's devotion
Then I began flowing in a smooth steady motion
Cause I'm contented to know that I've invented
Poetry which has been highly complimented
Thus how I rhyme is what I feel on stage
And from a fraction of a thought I can write a whole page
I'll just pull a notebook from off the shelf
And like Salt-N-Pepa I express myself
To make most of you know me, and some of you don't
But when it comes to cold challenging, I bet none of you won't
Arrange a battle, improve your style
Against a brother with a totally different profile
Most of you flake cold front ya flex
And hesitate on rhymes that should've been Memorex
But you forgot I remember you're an amateur
Mystery worshipper, now prefer
ThatI remind you or tease ya on who's the boss
Cause you suffer amnesia, that's memory loss
Well get this just as quiet as it's kept
MC's on the chart from the start has slept
Let's shake them,wake them, they should be woke
For what? They take MC'ing for a practical joke
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just as phony as ya wanna be

You present yourself to be the quiet storm
You're a sneaky littlesnake in a devilish form
But as they say, yo, to each its own
And to each one who plays with a microphone
Abbreviate microphone and M.I.C
Meaning what, Myself, I, you see
I invite those to battle me then they're through
Bust it, i'mnot prejudiced you're invited too
The rap convention or the MC show
I have rhymes to block those who hit below
The belt, that means biting a rhyme
Yes, I'll wax you, tax you and plus save time
Now who is known to uphold his own
And words are heard like a strong baritone
Freestyle techniques that's wild and bold
That'll smile in your face and still come so cold
That I'll freeze you to the point of non-defrost
Now you're trapped in the Land Of The Lost
Should I, could I, would I lose
When it's a selfish sore loser like you I choose
To roll your big eyes and suck your buck teeth
Because you're upset that you ever caused beef
Yo homeboy, I never meant to tease
But it's a slaughter, can someone help him please
Feeling uncomfortable, then loosen your belt
Once The Genius gets heated up, suckers will melt
Then after ya melt, ya start dripping like water
Then you can say this was a Goddamn slaughter
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be

Ain't no rhymes like the one I got
They put competitors in a trance, y'all
Radio stations ran them a lot
They made children play and dance y'all
How dare ya mention you're an MC
When the crowd disagrees on who you claim to be
Cause your battle piece are the rhymes you release
And that only make the crowd boos increase
Hey, may I say I'll slay a DJ
MC who try to defeat me or portray
One who claims he gain much respect
But in a battle, straight up and down ya getting wrecked
'Cause getting with me is definitely a slaughter
Or diving in a pool headfirst without water
So don't set yourself up to get brutalized
That only happens when you're not energized
But I'm so damn energized, I'm energetic
That I can wreck a microphone 'til it's pathetic
Oka, got it in your head, correct
That I'm victorious on any subject
You disbelieve, then huh, call the title
Then after one rhyme, you'll be calling me your idol
It's like..zap...another one on my jockstrap
Now you walk around praising my name
Cause I'm slamming and I make you feel the pain
You don't have what it takes to be an MC
Ya just phony as ya wanna be",https://genius.com/Gza-phony-as-ya-wanna-be-lyrics

 Yeah, yeah, Genius...
   Dreams... chase your dreams
 Diamond Willie, Mega Raw
 Back to reality
Genius, one time, yo

Yo, in these dark streets, life is never complete
Lords escape from those who strictly Play IV Keeps
Neighborhood; poverty stricten
Spin and Tell like Charles Dickens
The witnesses are sickening
I seen some aquitted with the wildest crime commited
While my brother faced life and never did it
Even in High Tide, they throwing brothers off the boat
In the streets, without a vest, it's hard to stay a-float
She wrote a note, before she *sliced her throat*
Couldn't live without her son, who was killed for his coat
I closely examined, physical branden
Witnessed myself standing in a land struck with famine
Multiple homocides from atomic wars
The aftermath, poison in lakes and reseviors
Thoughts spin, I narrowly escaped Hell's Gate
But only in the physical state
Chorus: singer
I knew a girl who wanted to live The Fast Life
(You're living too fast, baby)
Now the pain cuts like a knife
(You're living trife)
Chasing her dreams instead of reality
She lost her way
And nowhere can save her from the danger
Until she finds her way in Heaven

GZA, I got a similar story to tell
'bout the teenage adolescence of this kid named Will
An ex-coroner played the {*censored*}
{*censored*}
Young black and hispanic kids be stressed over
React against the world with rude behavior
In this present year
My search for hunger and ambition is crystal clear
While my young brothers seem to chase dreams
I be gunning down my wildest fantasies

I be escaping fiends, making cream
Ill kids tried to stick me for the green
Seen things that'll make your head spin
Instead *fuckin* stairways to Heaven make my eyes sparkly like a gem
Where your heart has been? Confiscated by the dark
 shorty use a *gun* and spark
Now we's in the street with the heat taking life apart
Seventeen years old, drama unfolds
Missing You like Puffy and Sting, now let them names ring
Chorus {2X}

Chasing dreams for the cash and cream
It seems some of us are fiends
For them luxery things, supreme sting
Losing lives while we out for the green
Stairs to Heaven shine like they diamond rings

Chase your dreams, don't get lost in reality
Cause your dreams will be your savior
And take you all the way to Heaven

Nothing can save you baby",https://genius.com/Gza-chasing-dreams-lyrics
Those Were the Days,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"Those were the days, back in Junior High
For an 8th grader, my style was kinda fly
And just to prove I was an MC Pro
I often sponsored a classroom show
And the hype part of my imagination
Was making my homeroom a hip-hop station
Minutes before the late bell would ring
I would greet the audience and then I'll swing
A lyric or two as the students barked
(woof, woof, woof) 'cause my rhymes had sparked
Off something causing the class to mingle
To a rhythm which is now a 12"" single
Letting off many styles of hip-hop
Holding the mic that I made in woodshop
Forget gold, my key chain was a cable
Two math textbooks were turntables
And for a mixer, something much cooler
A penny being cross-faded on a ruler
Measuring dope beats that were flexed
From hands that played a drum roll on a desk
From my homegirl, her name, fly as Emory
(peck sound) sweet memory
I remember sitting in my art class
Drawing up lyrics kinda fast
The outcome, a masterpiece
Live shows with hyped up rhymes released
As if lyrics were flowing from the heavens above
I'll grab a mic and provoke a push to a shove
From boys and girls who broke necks to see
The lyrical G.O.D

Those were the days

Now it's high school, lunch room's the scene
And I'm ready to flip the routine
In the cafeteria, period three
And here I come with the JVC
I go in my pocket and pull out a mic
Plug it in, check one-two... alright
Now who wanna show and prove their MC skills?
A brother stepped forward and tried to get ill
But when it came time to live out his name
He kicked rhymes that all sounded the same
But I did him in with a matter of time
And he was done with one victorious rhyme
He was shocked because he knew he was rocked
Along with his classmates from off his block
YO!, I'm telling you, I flipped his whole crew
One against one or one against two
Or three or four brothers who swore they can rhyme
Battled me and got taken out every time
From my style and my dope profile
The period of time that I rocked for a while
As a motivated, dominated supreme force
Cultivated, activated cream and source
The wise educated and born to be
The one who would flip an MC

Feel the Pain,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"Yes, yes y'all
I feel I'm a threat to high-powered MCs
'Cause when I roll up on their live shows they kinda freeze
From being approached by the Genius of rap
Whose poetry makes hands on a clock clap
You see, I be coming with strong rhymes galore
That even a stubborn MC can't ignore
That trying to defeat me brings about danger
Like a child speaking to a stranger
Soft MCs, I see more and more
With an ancient style, the prehistoric bore
Yes, they scream and roar 'til your throat get sore
Now you're running to the neighborhood drug store
To buy the cough drop, for what? The wrong hip hop
Now you swear you're on the good ship lollipop
But it's a sweet trip to the candy shop
Blaow! Now it's a six foot drop
For stealin' rhymes which is incorrect
Biting was the cause, death was the effect
'Cause the action affects the reaction
There's more like you, yo, you just the fraction
Of those who speak on how others are weak
You wanna sneak peek of the hype technique?
Don't make me run up and start flipping like I'm insane
Or you'll feel the pain

You'll feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain

I appreciate your compliments of my creation
Your standing up followed by your standing ovation
Your kindliness to listen to the true MC
Those who know me make me number one 'cause they agree
I rock on and on past the break of the dawn
Ask Rakeem, Unique Ason or even Melquan
'Cause I be flowing, at the same time showing
Hard headed individuals who don't be knowing
That I wrecked it, 'cause my style is perfected
And injected into a dope beat selected
By who? Easy Mo Bee, the engineer
But don't forget the hypest in the Northern Hemisphere
The G, the- the G, the- the Genius
From Earth, not Mercury or Venus
Or Mars, 'cause then I'll be a Martian
But even in that world I'll still be squashin'
Brothers who feel they have the heart
To battle me, then I'll just rip them apart
Don't make me run up and start flippin' like I'm insane
'Cause you'll feel the pain

Living Foul,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"Such a shame, such a shame
Critical...

You're living foul, things are getting wild
It's difficult to raise a child
Cause growin up in a lost environment
Every day becomes a new experiment
Now we are faced with problems
But if we come together we can solve them
Before we start to solving, here's a sample
Who's coming foward to set the example
Inflation, starvation
Surviving takes a strong nation
Those who like to bring about static
Be aware of the true Asiatic
What you see was predicted before
We were already warned of this bloody drug war
Wherever you sell it wherever you go
Ya still being clocked by the cops, ya know
You're paid by the hours, they see time flies
While your brain's being showered by a bunch of lies
You say I'm no slave where's the lock and chain
Hmmm, on your ignorant brain
Skip to ya loo with your High Pro Glow
Ya not stim off life, ya stimulated off blow
Or the new improved, ask beaming Jack
Criza, criza, crack

You're living foul, living foul

My people you were forced then brought
Stripped from your jewels brainwashed and then taught
To hate, deceive and dislike each other
Separating themselves, you're not my brother
Sit up at home for a mystery
Face-valuing things that you can't see
Can't taste can't smell, hear or feel
But senses prove everything is real
I'm here to present a positive way
If strong you'll accord if weak you'll stray
Drug users are stuck in the mud
Another 20th century modern day chud
These cannibal humanoid undernourished dwellers
Just took your check to the heroin cellar
Dope addicts, that walk and roam
Might have Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
AIDS, doesn't come from me
Cause I've studied and learned my history
It had to be something evil to bring that about
This is showing and proving beyond a shadow of a doubt

You're living foul, living foul

When you wake up, to a brand new day
And you think about your salary or your pay
You think of negative things, should I get involved
Caught in crime, serving time, that's problems to solve
So you think about it, say that you must quit
Smoke a blunt, then you do the same old shhhh
And while ya high you don't truly know why
You spent your cash so that you can buy
Some herb (word) and some Old E (yeah)
A fifty cent Philly so the herb can be
Rolled up modern style to what we call a blunt
Know the facts is true don't try to front
Or stray away from the positive message in the song
That's only showing and proving you're not strong
And the strong is what we need today
Why? They go the opposite way of living foul

You're living foul

The words right now flowing off my tongue
Is for the old, the young, the one's that's strong
Those who are worshippers of diamonds and gold
You should not be bought and you should not be sold
Those who always want but does not need
Is slightly controlled by the hands of greed
If you rob, steal, backstab, and abduct
Sooner or later you will self-destruct

You're living foul",https://genius.com/Gza-living-foul-lyrics
The Genius is Slammin’,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"What I'm about to flow on is so dope
The average hip hop fiend couldn't cope
Or explain my style because it's hard to define
So the fiend scratch and think and nod to the rhyme
That I lay down in a straight narrow path
While beats are just flowin' off a modern phonograph
Bass loud, high hats crisp and clear
That'll never let a weak MC interfere
Or bring about some technical difficulties
So I got prepared and I wrote these
Rhymes That just broke loose from the brain
Searching for dope beats on the same plane
For you to write new rhymes it is a must
But I come off with rhymes old as dust
Even as a speck of dust it existed
Ya got that?
Forget it, ya missed it

I'm slammin'
The Genius is slammin'

You flip me on the mic, no way
That's like me being played in April on the 1st day
Now who's a fool? What do you strive for?
Prime time juice on the box and fans galore
Forget it, 'cause you're not hype as they want you
With a maximum of 200 your rhymin' IQ
Is 10, meaning thin, you'll never win
So erase that, I'm not gonna lose friend
I know you're gassed, ya charged, and kinda stuck up
But I define your challenge, a total fuck up
And it's critical, a crying shame
How MC's challenge me and die in vain
But you should've came with ya whole rap
Community, now where's your unity
Cause what I see right now is you and I
And you're too weak to stop me from doin' my
Damage, you know, type of body and fender
NAH!, not the same way I did Brenda
But you had the audacity to step to me
Thinking you was Butch Cassidy and you could do me
How can you do me when you don't know me
And out of the hip hop styles ya couldn't show me
One style that may have damaged me
But that's something you'll never see


M.C. means mic constructor I build
That have suckers running like what track and field
When I conduct please don't interrupt
With ya if's or and's or but's keep ya mouth shut
The hip hop style that I own is highly known
To bury MC's like a dog bury bones
And in this field, yo, I'm extraordinary
And in my backyard there's a cemetery
Of meek MC's who try to speak
And off-peak technique that's soft and very weak
Yet they still have the heart to ask me to duel
And like Mr. T, I pity the fool
The shining chrome microphone is the device
That makes me stand out like men amongst mice
So respond to the stimuli then fly
Straight to the sky on a natural high
Cause I'm the transmitter buck wild and bitter
Thinking about trying me? Then reconsider
Cause if it sounds tempting boy, I'll Double Dare you
And speaking of your low life, I won't spare you
Cause you're not worthy of the mercy
Anyway The Genius is just bloodthirsty
So take a lickin' as the plot thickens
While ya head is took, ya be pumping like a chicken
How can you ever say my style was played
When my rhymes be chopping shit like a switchblade",https://genius.com/Gza-the-genius-is-slammin-lyrics
Who’s Your Rhymin’ Hero,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"Who's your rhymin' hero

I use lyrics versatile, beat up, on any style
Treat em like stepchilds and smile
I grab the mic then I check one-two
Brothers look, ""yo what he's gonna do""
Hmm, you know I don't get too hyped
I just fully load up the brain and cock the mic
And blast off rhymes, within a matter of time
I'm like a mirror of organized crime
For slaying an MC who think that he might be
The first brother who could come up and fight me
Start running like you're looking for P.C
Protective... custody
Cuz I'm blowing off, just for going off
You may think I'm showing off, cuz every rhyme is flowing off
A dope beat that is so sweet to the eardrum
Gets the crowd prepared to hear some
Super, high-powered lyrics, specially chosen
The battle's a snowstorm and brothers are frozen
Thirty-two degrees below zero

Now who's your rhymin' hero (3X)

The Genius, is a rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
But the way I speak is so poetic
Describe me on the mic, I'm energetic
Even if you roll up strapped with an uzi
Still your wack lyrics couldn't 
Yo, I'm not the type of guy
Cuz my lyrics are high powered, meaning fly
I'm not barn, I'm building hard
You thought that I was weak, well let me speak
With me being frozen this MC weather come to
All linked together
See I got wreck, wrapping things in check
You got germs, worms, plus a lack of respect
I'll be teachin, you couldn't handle
A style like mine, I dismantle
Just by pickin up the mic, and start showin
I cold turn it out, and yo then
I get super serious strong and then furious
Give an MC something to make them curious
On, professors, in college
I stomp em out just with supreme knowledge
Bustin up witches, yo I give stitches
Super-suckin-fuckin-lickin-some-sexy-scali bitches
I go off, and off men often
See the December's Primatene Mist coughin
Cuz I'm the God building hard never barred
Bringin crazy static to your attic
Now I'm known to flip a show

Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)

You have some MC's who get too hyped
From a ten-word rhyme it took em hours to type
That's not MCing, just an MC being
Weak on his words and never thinkin bout freeing
Positive thoughts that I let come out
I'm The Genius of this, I know what it's about
Cuz on the mic I'm a leader, school I am a reader
When it comes to sex, a strong good breeder
MC's max but every one I wax
And collect the cash money without being taxed
Now that I have your attention, I'd like to mention
Don't battle me at any rap convention
If so I'll show all who wants to know
To determine who's an amateur and who is a pro
Don't mean to get ill, cuz I know how you feel
You lack words like mines, talent and skill
Now I'm known to flip a show

Now who's your rhyming hero (4X)",https://genius.com/Gza-whos-your-rhymin-hero-lyrics
Interlude,Pro Tools,2008.0,"I've seen a kid
One night out at the spot
He had a Wu-Tang logo on his face
And just... a tattoo THIS big
And a whole bunch of other shit carved on it
You don't see that often, I mean
I mean I've never seen a, G-Unit logo
On someone's face, or arm, or...
Y'know; not sayin that there isn't
But umm...
I would say it's sort of like a cult following
Y'know but we're just regular people
I mean, I look
I look at myself as a regular person",https://genius.com/Gza-interlude-lyrics
Planetary Energy,UnKnown,2015.0,"We invaded Mars in parachutes
Size of Colosseums
Scale had to find the attributes
Whispers of space left over
From the moment of creation, down to the deaths of supernovas
A million light years away
The thermometer
Much differently like our neighbor
The Andromeda
Hydrogen gas cooled down and started forming
Clusters of stars that we begin swarming
Start a chemical chain and read it like a clock
And, if you can tell time, it's a beautiful thing to watch
By measuring the brightness of a star
According to the hydrogen burning in the core, you see the lightness
I am made up of layers, extreme pressure
Tectonic activity from such conveyors
A big ball of melted metal
99% percent of the planet explored on such a level

Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts

The dark like a rocket, many miles per hour
Global warming threatening MCs for power
Strictly hell fire, the ice caps melt
Oxygen, water, and food for thought is dealt
Space is so vast like a puck on ice
I glide across the track and never think twice
A little energy goes a long way
Electrically-charged, I move so fast, a year is one day
Deep-space quest to leave Earth
Away from the force that has shaped up all our lives since birth
Without Hip-Hop I'm like a fish out of water
Flappin' instead of rappin' and my days are shorter
The absence of sound weakens my muscles
The beauty of the divine art makes me hustle
Delivering hell storms of rap articles
Well-planned, detailed, intricate, methodical

Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts
Ignition sequence starts

Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero
All engines running
Permit liftoff
We have liftoff at 11:22AM Eastern Standard Time",https://genius.com/Gza-planetary-energy-lyrics
Drama,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"Talkin bout drama
I met a young brother, how young about eight
He seemed intelligent and rather quite straight
I greeted him, and struck a conversation
To see if the youngster had some self-motivation
Peace brother, what's your name, and how ya be
He said I be soon coming off the currency
I said gettin paid, he said yeah like my man's brother
Who has a condo he shares with his baby's mother
He said a condo beats my apartment
With no lights and no gas and much backed up rent
No hot water or heat, and invaded by plenty rats
That'll eat up the average alleycat
He said yeah boy, now that's poverty
I said word, I know and it bothers me
'Cause we are the victims, of a situation
How wicked man, separated
A nation and got us cold-killin off one another
(Word-word, to the mother)
It's getting hot, how hot, hotter than July
Cuz the murder and crime rate is rising very high
For example, in my neighborhood, it's so hot
I'm often woke up from the alarming sound of a shot
So I'm thinking what, is my neighborhood a trap
Could this be the place marked X on the map?
Now I'm spotted like a target, in the shooting gallery
So I start to seek for a better salary
So I can escape from where, from this ghetto life area
'Cause every day you're getting scarier
*blam blam* and scarier and scarier
Causing mass hysteria, it's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not to be bold and disrespect the homeless
'Cause I can see that they suffer from a long list
From not having shelter, and out on the street
Without a job and days without a bite to eat
Yo I feel for those, but here's another side
About some more people that's living on the outside
Because of the fact that they chose the wrong way
And it took em on a trip for a long day
Got to the point you started stealing from your house
Stalking the rooms late at night like a mouse
Your family's upset and you've got to go
When it's five below and we're expecting snow
And then you're on the train with a cup in your hand
Kicking dirt, and making it look like sand
Then after you run that game for a while
You start sucking up tokens from out the turnstile
Are you that desperate, just to get a hit
Is it so effective that you won't quit, and yo
Why do you come to me crying the blues?
About you can't get a job, well, go sell some street news
Then you can get straight and be real
But you'd rather rob and steal
And that's drama
Talkin bout drama
Not wonderama
But I'm talkin bout drama
Hear what I'm sayin?
I'm not talkin bout your mama
Nahhhh, but I'm talkin bout drama
Shaolin fist versus the Lama
Talkin bout drama",https://genius.com/Gza-drama-lyrics
Intro (Beneath the Surface),Beneath the Surface,1999.0,"As untold truths threaten our existence
And reality is cloaked with images of corruption
In the depths of the cavern of the mind comes another jewel
From the man who brought you ""Liquid Swords""
The director of ""Shadowboxin'"", ""4th Chamber"" and ""Cold World""
He now takes you ""Beneath the Surface""",https://genius.com/Gza-intro-beneath-the-surface-lyrics
Crash Your Crew (Video Version),Beneath the Surface,1999,"Hey yo; turn my shit up son too
No doubt (know exactly what you talking about)
Do-do yo (You know?)

I'm gonna crash ya crew, I'm gonna crash you too

Let's drink wine from the purest grapevine and rhyme
Out my motherfucking mind
Metal shine, light blind, cut the mic line
Catch juice from the lamp pole
Fifteen twenty-inch woofers blow the manhole
Made the street crack, massive feedback
Allah Math spin the beat back
The crowd look while the stage shook
Carpenters made errors
Craftsmen had his head severed
Pyroclastic flow, heavy like tons of snow
Wrote this rhyme in video, verbal assassin
Blasting, exploit your break through explosively
Echo chamber ate that rap up ferociously
Gain control, optimize the input channel
I set it relatively high for those on a panel
CD with the durable long-life cover
Very similar to no other
I seen a million try to set afloat, thousands that show
Observe with the patience of watching a flower grow
But one individual they forgot to frisk so
Now his pursuit is not without risk
A special no thanks for being flank
While journalists stay running in front of tanks
Flew out first class, came back, closed task
Rough path surfaces, no math
Military campaign, bust shots, cause inflammation of the brain
Beat Crazy Eddie insane
Feel the pain, niggas reign

I'm gonna crash ya crew, I'm gonna crash you too

Make sure you got your helmet on and strap it on tight
Via satellite, I crash like Roswell, landed in a poverty hell
El Israel, sipping cocktails, then we build like hammers and nails
Verbal carpentry, rap getting rocked in road cells
Economically, I give lobotomies, stay high off the finest weed
Form a colony off the words I prophecy
Brain damage you, crash your crew like Norfolk lawsuits
Mayday, pull out your parachute, check the parables
Drunk off the Absolute, get off my avenue
Drove you over like the bulldozer
Tell your cap'(tain) to train war soldiers
Your whole camp get the cold shoulder

I'm gonna crash ya crew, I'm gonna crash you too",https://genius.com/Gza-crash-your-crew-video-version-lyrics
Stop the Nonsense,Words From the Genius,1991.0,"I see youngsters, y'know, teenagers
Walking around with beepers and pagers
And who's beeping them? Oh it's the boss
Making sure no one is taking a loss
On his multi-thousand dollar operation
But how does he thank them for their participation
Whatever the pay, it's still not enough
Cause what they got into is some serious stuff
Hours a day back and forth on the strip
Sending customers far on a trip
And this roots of all evil brings about war
Cause you wanna open up another crack store
Children can't play in the parks and things
Because a stray bullet might be headed for the swings
You never though about that, oh I guess not
All you thought about was owning your own spot
To putting more and more people to sleep
But ya heading for a pothole six feet deep
You see the problem has gotten more serious
And the community is getting more furious
Get it deep in your head I told you so
It goes way beyond just saying no
Stop the nonsense

Remember Steve with the blue Jag?
They found him cut up and stuffed in a bag
He had his own operation uptown
And there was plenty other drug dealers he would cut down
In other words, he was living foul
Shootin up neighborhoods acting wild
He said he had to protect his drug trade
Which we manufactured throughout arcades
He made sure his enemies felt the pain
Whoever he felt was a threat, got slain
Like Donna, who was only sixteen
And she was employed on another drug scene
She try to set up a hit on Steve
But he sliced her throat until she could not breathe
This is what happens when you deal
You don't care on who you got to kill
I might walk outside and get shot
Because I live next door to a drug spot
And I don't need this stuff in my vicinity
Of me being shot for mistaken identity
This is the stuff that Steve was on
Now he's dead long and gone
With his old nonsense",https://genius.com/Gza-stop-the-nonsense-lyrics
