As The World Turns (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,1987,"As the world turns—
As the world turns my niggas grow and grow and grow
And get dough and roll and ride
Niggas die and mommas cry
Niggas got alibis and suicides and homicides
And three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And niggas fame, as the world turns—

Though I walk through the valley of Hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow, expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
And still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change
If we search deeper
God bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deep as Poseidon
When we ride, plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin' your fake smiles, plastic tears
Like last year, niggas stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta ass bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the mob, M.O.B
Killin' busters is my motherfuckin' job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, niggas reported missin'
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns—

Turns, turns, turns, turns and turns
My niggas grow and grow and grow
(As The World Turns)
Gettin' dough and dough and dough
From this state to that state
From this cell to that cell, (As the world turns)
[Verse 2: Young Noble & 
2Pac
]
Ain't no frontin' me I see my fucking soul, right in front of me
Yo Pac cover me, I'm in this thang for the luxury
What's up with me I'm fuckin' chilling, dreams of millions (
Ya moms in this bitch
)
Time to keep my green buildings, maintained with no feelings
For these weak motherfuckers, my heat street suckers (
Weak-ass tricks
)
New street geek plucker, a long wrap without a rubber
Listen to my Bompton, outlaw blast the Compton, gettin' half in pumpin' (
Jersey in this bitch
)
I cluck the razor slap it chocolate, hey now
Got a lotta g's on the way now, mercy and paydown
My niggas blownin' up, getting paid now (
Get dough, nigga
)

Precision in my favors, unanimous decision
Fuck a religion dead on collision with the walls of prison
A street mercenary, lieutenant penned it
Move it down like Emmett, only five minutes in it
Got my town extended, Saddam Hussan
A Big San, San Wan, I'm the first to bomb
Dear Mama I disrespected ways to your vagina
Household de-ca, when the cops was behind ya
Some niggas got crippled, money still gettin' tripled
Suckers'll stick you, I keep my hands on the pistol
It's drastic, niggas'll set you up for the casket
Fake teardrops, real closed casket they got it mastered
Unprofessionally, I crawl with aggressional
Thoughts me and my gats, climbs apps like a sexual
For this pain and agony, I feel allegated gravity
And my heart hurt, like I got voodoo pins stabbin' me
(Ooh, shit)

Rest in Peace Soldier (Rest in Peace Soldier)
Haha

As The World Turns
(And my niggas roll by, hahaha)
As The World Turns
(Niggas get a swoll eye, and it don't stop and it don't quit
That real shit!)
As The World Turns
(Niggas die for this, How many you niggas try to this?)
As The World Turns
(Murderin' methods— haha, Outlaw!)

Only haters caught feelings when my homie caught millions (
Biggie
)
And acquired the desired status of boss livin'
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin' our dues with bloodshed, ain't shit y'all could tell us
Fellas – mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin', armies ridin', soldiers born wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now, as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nothin' left to earn

October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my MAC-11 hit the block playin'
Only five years up in this bitch, papa runnin' from the feds
Puttin' peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown, but only man of the home
To protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin' straight shots of Cristal brothers
100 dollar snot box on cee-lo, fuck eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin' pounds of weight
Fuck my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
For this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns

Ayy yo! (As the world turns)
Which one of y'all niggas out there gettin' money out there
Who gettin' money, real G's nigga!
Fuck that lil' five hundred ten dollar shit that lil' hundred dollar shit
I'm talkin' bout brand new creep
Black Jesus!! I know he sees and only he can feed us
I believe you, you believe us
Only leaders no followers
All these niggas tryna' get his advice but they swallow us whole
I take yo' soul nigga lost control, is ya bad and bold? (Haha)
My .44 go, Four-Four, and they drop
When a nigga picture all you using a cop (Haha)
Anybody that try to stop me take me off this planet I can't stand you trick ass niggas if you try to ban this here
Have no fear The Outlawz have come nigga disappear when we run (Bitch ass)
When we come when we ride
Suicides and homicides is what we supply
Niggas die don't cry now (As The World Turns)
You Die Now (Outlaw riders)
What you found, niggas from the pound, three fifty-seven, all the way to heaven (Haha)
My MAC-11 keep these niggas breathin', who do you believe in?
Only he can see us, black Jesus!
Haha, yes, yes! As the world turns (As the world turns)
Tha Outlawz, ghetto stars, Makaveli The Don, yes
Death Row, Haha
Death Row gave birth to a new seed, Makaveli Records
Feel me now, yeah! (Especially with Mobb Deep)
No doubt, Lil' Napoleon is this bi-yatch
With a big ass four-five bigger than him (Haha)
Niggas don't want it (Outlawz Nigga)
Westside! Nigga, we got Jersey
We got the Bay to LA, best side
Westside (Y'all know what time it is)
When you close your eyes and wake up in the morning
I'll be there to bless you",https://genius.com/2pac-as-the-world-turns-original-version-lyrics
Babies Having Babies (1987 Freestyle),Unreleased Songs,1987,"Yo this rhyme is dedicated to those ladies
How bad things were
Copyright 1987
Written By Tupac Shakur and Dana M. Smith
Thank you

Babies having babies
Oh boy, it’s a shame
Society blames the mother
But she’s not to blame
Ayy yo babies having babies, it should be a crime
So me and D, got high and made it a rhyme
And if you don’t know what you’re doing
Then don't have sex, stop acting ill , take the  pill
Or you’ll be next

Babies, having babies
Babies, 16, 17, having babies

You know what th-th-this is a story that I must tell
'Cause it's the mother not the father that is going through hell
You know nothing of your body, you're in poor health
So if you love her, use rubber and protect yourself
Ladies listen to the rhyme and take it from me
These young boys can’t care for your baby
Now makin' love and havin' sex is not all in one
And makin' love is true and feelin', and sex that is none
I know you're a young lady, you don't understand
You don’t need to have a baby to keep your man
Listen close to this message that we are sendin'
Just start another requiem digest, beginning
Be protective of your mind, your body and soul
 baby, use birth control
Party people with the message that’s in our rhymes
And make babies, make a difference in these hard times
We’re not trying to mislead you, the message is right
It’s not a cabbage patch doll, this is your life
Ladies respect your body, and learn your worth
'Cause you’re the brightest light, or this is more 
Now you don’t really want a baby
You'll have time for that later
Take your time for a man
And the feeling with be greater

Babies, having babies
Babies, 16, 17, having babies
It’s a shame
Slick D tell 'em

Listen fellas, protect your ladies
Doesn’t mean you love her more
'Cause she’s having your baby
'Cause you’re born in the slum
Doesn’t mean you gotta stay
Gotta rise above it all and keep it that way
Society has a way of killing our hope
As a lady, expect it, I fell all-day
There's a new generation, leadin' the nation
We can’t do it on our own, we need participation
Babies having babies, who can you blame?
You don’t know how it started, damn it’s a shame
Were not trying to stir you wrong, so don’t act ill
But you better use a condom, 'cause AIDS can kill
Don’t have to be a homosexual, can be intellectual
Brotha use a rubber whenever you get sexual
Women should be thinkin', all the lives I create
Shouldn’t be left to a mess of a stupid mistake
I swear I get mad, whenever I hear
That a girl had a baby and the father don’t care
See for him it’s a trophy to put in his home
But for her it’s a life, she’s left up all alone
So fellas listen to the rhyme, 'cause you’re to blame
WHY? Babies having babies, damn it’s a shame
Shame, shame, shame, shame
Word! Shame shame, shame, shame",https://genius.com/2pac-babies-having-babies-1987-freestyle-lyrics

A Day in the Life,Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988–1991,1988,"(Ray Tyson)
Postal border was makin' me mad
So I get up in my cruiser, broke out of the pad
Rolled to the West Side to check out my boys
Twenty brothers in the park, all bringin' the noise
Stepped out the car, Levi's saggin'
Gold around my neck with my limb-walk laggin'
Walked up on my boys with the old E chillin'
The box with the big beats and my boys started illin'
A hoop game started so I jump in
Had the hoods' toughest team so I just had to win
Diz to the outside, 2Pac up the center
A ten minute game and we were the winners
The boys started smackin', talkin' that slack and
Till he see my posse and the suckers started backin'
Tried to say we cheat, because he got beat
Another lightweight sucker that can't handle defeat
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's just a day in the life
(2Pac)
Finally I'm on vacation and school is through
So here I am, on Monday mornin' with nothin' to do
Tried to get outta my bed, but I can't move
Ya see I'm stuck to my matress like crazy glue
So there I lay, for half the day just thinkin'
Got up to brush my teeth cause my breath started stinkin'
But I was all alone so it wasn't no thing
Got up to take a shower and heard the phone ring
Picked it up, the salutations, little bit frustrations
Who could be disturbin' me on my vacation?
Speakin' on the phone in an aggravatin' tone
Now I know what Michael meant by leave me alone
So I'm askin' who is it? and the answer shocks me
It was the voice of my homeboy Roc-T
Him and Dizzy had been waitin' for me
Had a show at three and now I'm late as can be
Said I have to take a shower, I'll go ahead and take it
If I leave within the hour, I still might make it
I'm rollin' in a sweatsuit, wasn't tryin' to get cute
Hopped on to the stage and said: ""Sorry that I kept you""
I started rappin', girls started clappin'
Couldn't wait to finish so I could start mackin'
Jumped off stage, picked up the girl for the night
Huh, that's how I'm livin', a day in the life, come on
A day in the life
(Ray Tyson)
Stretch white limo hits the colosseum
A crowd full of people sayin: ""I can't wait to see 'em""
Who is in the limo, who are they talkin' about?
Strictly Dope in the house, here to turn the party out
We get out the car and can barely stand
Cause everywhere I look are screamin' fans
Girls on my tip but I really don't sweat 'em
They'll tear my new clothes if your bodyguards'll let 'em
Hit backstage with two minutes to spare
Just enough time to grip a breath of fresh air
We hear the introduction, the audience is loud
I stepped out on the stage and then I moved the crowd
Winners all over, we tried to leave the scene
But there's a whole crowd of people at the limousine
Pen and paper in my face, I couldn't be mean
So I was signin' autographs at the age of seventeen
People wonder why I choose to live the hype
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life
Kick it - it's a day in the life
Kick it, kick it, kick it
(2Pac)
Coolin' with my posse at the neighborhood disco
Talkin' to a cutie as I'm sippin' on my cisco
Askin' me to dance but I keep on sayin' ""No""
Hate to dance fast, I only like to do it slow
Dizzy's on the dance floor, funky, funky motion
Girl keeps on sweatin' me with sexual kind of totions
Roc is signin' autographs makin' girlies dizzy
Crowd sweatin' Strictly Dope cause we're gettin' busy
Suckers wanna battle us, we move in silence
Strictly Dope is positive, we're tryin' to stop the violence
Started feel tipsy, I'm lookin' for the door
The Cisco had me dizzy, I stumbled to the floor
And more I try to sit up, the less I seem to get up
My stomach starts to turn and my head feels wit' up
The room begins to spin, I pass out for the night
Just another way of livin' a day in the life, kick it
(Ray Tyson & 2Pac)
Knew I was a genius, soon as you seen this
Avoid ho's value, don't have to redeem this
Teenage terror, no room for error
A girl start dissin', and I scare her!
Risin' like inflation on your favorite station
Rap is my forte and my recreation
Girls wanna kiss me, suckers wanna diss me
My mother didn't want me to be, but I'm a emcee
The ladies desire, emcees admire
That's why many hate me and call me liar
Hoods of the hype-tip, girls on the ill-trip
I'm through rockin' this whack, so that's it
I am the high type, my style is so right
It's not hard to understand, it's just a day in the life",https://genius.com/2pac-a-day-in-the-life-lyrics
Let Knowledge Drop,Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988–1991,1988,"Let knowledge drop
Why should I be forced to play dumb?
I know where I came from so I'm going to claim some
But rocking to the top where the cream of the crop
Suckers calling the cops but they can come and get dropped
Stop think of the past the brothers that die for
Sucker to try for never to cry more
Tricks to hold his back but we'll see at the end
He's a fake not a friend
So he's thinking of when he can backstab grab or go your hole
Yo he's a trick so he sold his soul for gold
Now I know the reason we must excel
Cause if we don't we'll end up in the cell
Move on be strong with unity
Cause that's the only way to build communities
Lies are told but yo lives must move on
And never stop open your mind to this rhyme and let it drop

Drop that 
Let knowledge drop

Yo I'm running so I refuse to stop
Get sweated by them sell out cops
And I wink cause I pin the opposition
I'm on a mission to preach and teach to reach
So listen up to the flavor I gave you now dropping it
We folks know ballers know no stopping it
Dropping knowledge like the ay bomb dilly as napalm
I got you scared and nervous you tried to stay calm
For the simple fact that I'm black and educated
Proud of who am I and you hated
So all I have tried for this many have die for this
You see it and you hear it and you loving it
Now you buying this always keep your head look to the mountain top
Aiyyo rock and let knowledge drop

Drop that 
Let knowledge drop

Suckers suffocate when I hype this because you can write this
You constantly bite this
Thought that you could get me but you sweating me too close
Caught with the dope dose
Now suckers get toast wondering who you tossed
Cause you building a boom force
Like what you hearing so your checking with the source
2Pac brother with the rhymes to rock on
Dizzy gets busy by putting beats to drop on
Amateurs get damaged if you try to attack me
Suckers get jealous cause the girls get at me
I'm not conceited but defeated I won't be
As long as there's dope beats I'll never be lonely stop
And let me breathe a minute
Aiyyo Dizzy what's up put the base back in it

Let knowledge drop 

By any means neccessary it's kind of scary
Knowledge of the hands of adversaries
Makes them the larger leader kind of guerilla control
I was waiting for a present GOD gave me a goal
I refuse to be busting like a sucker for I'm fighting like a titan
And run you down like a truck
I'll take a chance I vote for rock can see
Not mediocrity thinking security you got deal with me
Knowledge appealed to me
Pay back's a mutha if you steal from me
The bass pumps as the speakers pop the house jump
And knowledge drops

Drop that 
Let knowledge drop
Strictly strictly yea dope ",https://genius.com/2pac-let-knowledge-drop-lyrics
Minnie the Moocher,Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988–1991,1988,"I know this girl and her name is Minnie
Livin' in the projects didn't own a penny
Met her at a school dance so I took a chance
Walked her to the parkin' lot for a little romance
Got to my car, put the key in the ignition
Turned on the slow jams, I was on a mission
I was catchin' wild things like the chicken pox
I was ""J"" and knockin' boots right down the socks
She was freaky and wild, oh man could I call it?
But when I dropped her off, she had stole my wallet
I couldn't quite believe that why a hoocher-coocher?
But that was my first experience with MINNIE THE MOOCHER!!

Minnie the Moocher was a legend on the block I'm from
A dream girl to many brothers, but true to none
Her reputation was enormous - a real go getter
And once a brother met her, he wanted to get with her
Maybe it was her smile, her personality or
The way she shook her shimmy or the clothes she wore
But whatever it was, Minnie the Moocher was an expert
Real heart-breaker, but never get hurt
She had this boyfriend, his name was Diamond
Helpin' Minnie out with the little social climbin'
Met with Politicians, peace to many others
Suddenly and instantly, they became her lovers
She took the power that they possessed
And Minnie did it all without gettin' undressed
Minnie dissed Diamond sayin' that he could not live with her
But he wanted payment for the things he did for her
He grabbed the gun sittin' on the nightstand
Minnie held the bullets, put the pistol in her right hand
She was a legend to everyone who knew her
That's is my memory of Minnie the Moocher

Minnie had a boyfriend, a gambler
Addicted to poker, an alcoholic, a basehead, crack smoker
He took her to Harlem, and all around Chinatown
He bought some base, a pipe a tape of hard-rap sounds
She was an addict, tired of the static and poverty
Sick of the same ghetto misery
See, Minnie was a young kid lookin' for excitement
Smokey was a hoodlum, headin' for inditement
Then one day their relationship stopped
When Smokey was killed by the M-I-C-Cops
Minnie was hurt, lost without a clue
To her, there was no chance of gettin' somebody new
So she walked home sadly, as bad as it seems
She cried herself to sleep to find the man of her dreams

She had dreams and schemes about the King of Sweden
He gave her things that this girl was much needin'
A plush house made of gold and steel
A diamond car with a platt in the wheel
Now you might think this is a lot of stuff
But to Minnie this was not enough
He bought a stable, full of thorough-bred race horses
His meal she ate was a dozen courses
She had a fortune in nickels and dimes
And she sat around and counted it a billion times
She had bank, yeah Minnie was clockin'
Had every sucker in the neighborhood JOCKIN'!!
She would walk by tryin' all to wink her eye
Then she dissin', with zero reply",https://genius.com/2pac-minnie-the-moocher-lyrics
My Burnin’ Heart,Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988–1991,1988,"I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me, I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Huh - reach for my drink and for a second we touch
Words are muttered I stutter, cause I want you that much
The situation is a no-win, cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, of fallin for his girlfriend
I know it's wrong but my heart is filled with purity
I offer passion but he offers security
Its like a trap that I'm sinkin into
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin cause I'm thinkin of you
Then we make eye contact, and I can't hold back
I try to shake it but the feelin comes right back
What have I gotten into, I feel posessed by you
I have these thoughts at night, of undressin you
Its kinda obvious blind men might see it
But he doesn't, so he keeps on trustin me
Leaves me alone wit you, while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me, with this temptation?
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin - you're sayin to come over
What do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
Its gettin rougher cause I suffer from a burnin heart..
My burnin heart..

Girl, you are my one and only
You are my angel, and now ya wanna leave me lonely
What did I do? Baby did I treat you bad?
My heart is broken, and now ya make me sad
I remember, when this love affair first started
We was so in love, and now we are departed
Girl, I'll buy ya anything ya heart desires
I have to let ya know, baby you're my fire
Warm and wet, each kiss is prolonged
It's your sweet caress that makes Rock T strong
Just bein with you, and seein the two of us
Walkin along the beach, cause girl you are my peach
So sweet and tender, my love I surrender
No need to pretend, that you'll want it to end
I'll never let you go, you're forever my girl
Ya know why? Cause girl, you are my world
My burnin' heart..

Totally tounge tied, every three seconds I keep watchin you
He's my best friend, but I can't help clockin you
How could this be? How could we both love you
Now I'm trapped in this position and don't know what to do
I could forget about you, pretend that we never met
But when I'm here without you, I start to heavily sweat
You give me looks that reinforce the bond that's already there
So many times I find eyes locked up and just passionately stare
Play the role like you don't matter, he swears that we hate each other
But in reality we can't wait to taste each other
You're my addiction casue I fiend for your desperately
I stand here fantasizin, because you're next to me
What can I do, with this passion I feel
It's too hard to conceal, so I know it's for real
Watched you so many times, I know where every curve is
I think you reads my mind, and so I'm feelin nervous
I wana tell you how I feel, but that wouldn't help
It would only cause problems so I keep to myself
Even though, it drives me crazy, to see you sittin with him
A tear rolls down my cheek, because I see you kiss him
I know the words you're sayin before they can be said
Hear the thoughts that you thinkin before they come in your head
Wouldn't hurt the brother, for anything in this world
But damn I fell in love with his girl - my burnin heart, heart, heart..

My heart is burnin, ya know it's yearin, for ya sweet caress
I lay in ecstacy, as you kiss and rub my chest
You know ya love me, why must you deny yourself
What I can offer you, yet you want somebody else?
It's not that - well then girl, what could it be?
I hope I'm good for you, cause baby you're so good for me
Many nights I cried and tried to make this work
Then act the fool and cool and cruel like the church
Well I'm sorry baby, I have to let you know
You are my life my strength I refuse to let you go
You are so beautiful, baby you light up my life
I close my eyes and dream of that you'll become my wife
Day in and day out, it's you I pray about
Don't lock the door to your heart and make me stay out
I love you cause honey, you're like a work of art
You got me on fire - my burnin heart..

I lay awake tonight, because I wanna be with you
If you were beside me, I'd playfully kiss you
Each time I see ya, the feelin gets stronger
You sit a bit closer, we stare a lot longer
Huh - reach for my drink and for a second we touch

Leaves me alone wit you, while he's on vacation
Well how could he leave me, with this temptation?
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova
But you keep callin - you're sayin to come over
What do I do? Go or stay and play it smart
Its gettin rougher cause I suffer from a burnin heart..
My burnin heart..

Never Be Beat,Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988–1991,1988,"(Intro)
(*""Bad motherfucker and you know this"" - cut and scratched*)
Stricly Dope in the house

Fumble suckers tumble, god damn I'm good
Since I was born I was strong, always knew that I could
Don't care anywhere any place I'll rock
Give me a mic to light and competition will drop
Fast or slow, I'll go and no one is gonna stop me yo
You must be kiddin', you swear you're gonna drop me no
Well sure as battlin' is bad for your health
Know you're confident my friend but don't fool yourself
My mic's a weapon, I'm steppin' with a capable rhyme
Yo, your time for playin' is over you got your crew I got mine
Not braggin', I'm bad and I could only get better
Your girl came on to me she wanted me I wouldn't let her
Don't make sense to come against me and my man ""D""
How it is, how it was, that's the way it'll be
But you still think you can beat me, huh, get it together
Cause I'll never be beat, never be beat, NEVER!!
(*""Bad motherfucker and you know this"" - cut and scratched*)
Stricly Dope in the house
(Ray Tyson)
Boldy, you step into the trap of the beast
Cause I'm the predator competitor and risin' like yeast
I'm the microphone musician musically I'm the most
When I rumble you tumble like a burnt piece of toast
Proceed with caution I cannot be stopped
A deadly weapon that is kept inside a sentry lock
Strong hold holdin' on but there's no holds barred
Fuck around and feel the wrath and you're forever scarred
Anybody want to battle just step the hell up
I'll toss your ass like a salad and eat you all up
You climb the rope of success but you know you can't win
You get discouraged because I hold the other end
If I let go, like all the others you will fall
The vicious vocalist consoloist will still be raw

You go in battles like a sucker but you'll never recoup
But I'm the veteran the veteran goin' like a troop
Try to stop me you can't, you puff and you pant
Try to beat me at this game, but get stomped like an ant
In the long run I'm the one that's holdin' the mic
Upset to get to me sweatin' me for the rhymes that I write
This time we're goin' at it, silly sucker, get ready
Cause I'm your worst nightmare, FUCK FREDDY!!
Where's that motherfucker that said that I was a dope
Tyin' my rhymes like a rope I'll pull it tight and you'll choke
You swear that you could beat me punk get it together
Cause I'll never be beat ya punk, NEVER!!
(*""Bad motherfucker and you know this"" - cut and scratched*)
(Ray Tyson)
Hard is what you wanted, now that's what you're gettin'
I'm movin' and groovin' and proven and you're still sittin'
Got me blowin' up like a Hawalian volcano
Runnin' things like drano, lettin' you know that there ain't no
Body gonna diss me now I'm comin' exact
I'm paid I got it made, now that I'm makin' tracks
This is a lesson, at bein' dope that is
Cordless mics is mine, the wheels are his
Tons and tons of freaks I'm a Mac Daddio
Writin' def jams while I'm chillin' on my patio
You are useless as a toothless piranha
I'm ruthless now I'm gonna
Bust it and discuss it make it funky to hear
Paragraph to the people penetratin' your ear
You wanna taste of it, ooh here take a full dose
Burn you up like radiation if you get too close

Cause my mouth is like an uzi when it moves so quick
And the lyrics are the bullets that I'm loadin' it with
You wanna beat me homeboy, you will be destroyed
Get dropped like a habit and played like a toy
Never defeated not conceited, but let's face facts
Couldn't beat me with a motherfuckin' baseball bat
If I gave you a bomb that was nuclear armed
You could shoot it at me sucker and I wouldn't get harmed
Cause punk you can't stop me, bullets couldn't drop me
Stand on a mountain and still couldn't top me, huh
You think you'll beat me boy get it together
Cause I'll never be beat ya punk NEVER!!
(*""Bad motherfucker and you know this"" - cut and scratched*)
(Ray Tyson)
When you hear my beat thumpin' it's a maxium charge
Cause I'm the hip-hop hood, the record leader at large
Got a PHD in hip-hop history
A deadly boy not a toy but a poetry, PRODIGY!!
Young beat conisseur hummin' like a bird
It was true when you heard I'm the wiz a word
Your eyes dilate, your ears drums expand
When my voice comes through the speaker from the mic in my hand
Woofers stompin' like thunder all about to explode
The needle on the nuance stuck in overload
Don't laugh cause I'm serious mister mysterious
Don't make me mad (why?) Cause I get furious
Countless time after time just when you think I'm through
I let my melody stretch to make more for you
Just bust it cause I'm just too clever
And I'll never be beat ya punk, NEVER!!

Rhyme-fumble suckers tumble, god damn I'm good
Since I was born I was strong, always knew that I could
Don't care anywhere any place I'll rock
Give me a mic to light and competition will drop
Fast or slow, I'll go and no one is gonna stop me yo
You must be kiddin', you swear you're gonna drop me no
Well sure as battlin' is bad for your health
Know you're confident my friend but don't fool yourself

The Case of the Misplaced Mic,Beginnings: The Lost Tapes 1988–1991,1988,"They finally did it (What's that?)
They stole the mic I grip
Now that It's gone (What's wrong?)
I'm feelin' tired and sick
(How did they do it?) I don't know, I wasn't sleepin' that long
When i woke up (What happened brotha?)
My microphone was gone
First I panicked (how?)
I put the cops on the case
But they was stumped (damn)
Without a clue or a trace
So as sure as smokin' cigarettes is bad for your health
If I want my microphone back I'll find it myself
So I picked up the phone (For what?)
I called Dizzy (What's up?)
My mic's gone (Word?)
Let's get busy!
Before I told Dizzy what I wanted to do
He was over at my house with the TMS crew
He said (Word is out on every mouth on the street
Now that its gone, its not long 'til you're beat)
And then it hit me (Damn)
I got a battle at six
Without my microphone
I'm guaranteed to get whipped
Ya might think it's unbelievable
But word to the strength
When it comes to rockin' rhymes
I'm a musical nymph
They gave me other mics
But yo, it wasn't no use
I tried to rock it (One-two one-two)
But I couldn't get loose
I said forget it
With microphone or not, I gotta do it
Give it all that I got (Yo, what if ya lose?)
It'd be the first time I lost
But if I beat 'em, it'd finally prove that I'm the boss
I grabbed my leather jacket
Walked through the streets
Was hopin' and prayin'
Strictly Dope won't get beat
I begin to get hyped; I was ready to fight
Yo, I was confident that I went
To hell with the mic!
I hop on to the stage
Dizzy started the beat
The sucka' shivered
Because he tasted defeat
Then I signaled to Dizzy and
Bust a rhyme with my head
Perpetrator fell back (Ha!)

I was happy as hell

Put my hand in my pocket
And there was my mic

Boy!
In eighty-eight
[Verse 1: 2Pac & 
Ace Rocker
]
Ayy yo, don't want to diss you, but your girl's a freak
All in my face, every time I speak
And if she's not following me, or in my face
That she's clockin' and jockin' my homeboy 
Ace
Making you look bad, 'cause the girl is hot
Spending all your money, every chance she's got
Gave all your gold rings off your hand
But she gave it all up to another man
'Cause your girl is skeezer, I swear she is
Bitch said she was a virgin, but she got three kids
First, she kissed Ace, then she sloughed me down
Don't want to diss you, but you got the fastest girl in town
All in my pants, every time we dance
Tried to stop her, homeboy, but she got quick hands
There's no easy way to tell ya
But short and sweet, don't wanna diss you but your girl's a freak

I saw your girl
Yeah man, I seen her man walking down the avenue
His girl, ain't that something?
Yo D, I saw your girl
Word man! It was ridiculous
I can't believe you let that go on
It's crazy to me, but yo I ain't finished, check this out
Yo

I saw your girl, that freak is hot
When we closed that show, everything she's got
Making people stare, when she goes somewhere
When she walks, people talk but your girl don't care
I saw your girl real late one night
Had on a see-through blouse, and her pants were tight
Walked in a club and began to dance
By ten had a nigga all in her pants
You say she's devoted, but that's not true
If she's devoted, she certainly not devoted to you
I know it's your girl, so I say freeze
But I'm too late 'cause she's already on her knees
Slip, slurp and slop from bottom to top
Like Maxwell house, good to the last drop
Not tryna hurt you, bro, just lettin' you know
That your girl is a goddamn ho

I saw your girl
Yep, it was her, no doubt about it
No mistaken identity, it was his girl
(
What's up, man
)
Yo D, didn't you see him too? (
Yep!
)
Word!
You know what man, I saw your girl
Tell him D, you seen her?
Don't hide it, just say it man, word

I saw your girl, once before I was chillin' at a party
Look across the dancefloor, your girl came in with somebody
So I thought I'd go see, she takes the D
This is Billy he came with me
 Billy requested, and your girl suggested
If we would go to her house was I interested?
A thought went into my mind of agony and much fear
But damn it's not my girl, so how the hell I care!
I saw your girl, she's a skeezer and she's jockin' me down
Who knows, suppose she has AIDS and she spreadin' out round?
Buy her close and she knows, that you're a clown
You smile a pose and she goes with every man in town
Think your girl is crazy, but she insists
That if I treat her like a leprechaun, she grant me a wish
If I try to get close and sneak her a kiss
This is supposed to be your girl, but all you do is get this
I think your girl is crazy but get dissed—
Now I'm back to the party wit' your girl and Billy
You invited him to go to her house, she think you Willy
And then she leans over and says I love you
You still pretending is your girlfriend and she loves you too
Then I couldn't find them, they were out of sight
So I thought to myself, damn this ain't right
'Cause she playin' on my boy, and it was plain to see
If it was my girl, I would want him to tell me
I called him up and told him everything he didn't wanna hear
He cursed me out, call me a liar and a  in my ear
You hope you learned your lesson, the more you know it
He's gettin' mad 'cause his girl's a ho

I saw your girl
Ayy yo man
Saw your girl
Yo for real man, that was crazy
I saw your girl
Word is born, man that was crazy man
I saw your girl
He let it go on though, man, it's his fault
Yo, I saw your girl!",https://genius.com/2pac-i-saw-your-girl-1988-acapella-lyrics
Terror On The Tables (1988 Acapella),Unreleased Songs,1988,"Play Terror's on the cut, listen up can't you hear him?
Don't sit there looking stupid, come on, help me cheer him
He might look like he's innocent, but don't get fooled
Soon as he touches turntables, he gets cold then cruel
Terror's tearing it up, I don't know how he does it
Every record that we give him, he plays it and he cut it
There's holes in all his clothes, that boy is a mess
He won't get up the turntables, 'til he show his best
So would you give us applause, clap your hands in his stance
And maybe then me and my crew we give some help for this man

Uh-oh
Terror's on the tables
Uh-oh
Terror's on the tables

He's a cuttin' maniac, the boy won't stop
Come on Terror take a break, or maybe them he can wild
Last time we let him cut, he cut for three days straight
And at the rate he's goin' at,  how long he'll take
Even when we eatin' dinner, he cuts with his plate
He brought his table and his records to his first date
I think the boy's insane, 'cause something has to be wrong
'Cause you can't get up on the tables and cut that long
He doesn't, he just stopped to eat, intravenously fed
Good to see he take his turntables and his records to bed
Oh, I don't know what to do, talking 'bout crew—

Brenda’s Got a Baby,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"Brenda's got a baby

I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community
Now Brenda really never knew her moms
And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his arms
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
Whatever, he left her and she had the baby solo
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep
She wrapped the baby up and threw him in a trash heap
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
Brenda wants to run away
Momma say ""you makin' me lose pay
There's social workers here every day""
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed
So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name
She's got a baby",https://genius.com/2pac-brendas-got-a-baby-lyrics

A smoking-ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his smokin' ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said ""Freeze!""
I popped him in his knees and shot him—punk, please
’Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin' like a bitch, cause you don't know how to, hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me body
One to the chest, another to his fuckin' dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggas

Crooked ass niggas

(Cri-cri-criminal)

Now listen to the mack of the crooked nigga trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick stepping to the niggas with the props
And any motherfucker with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a motherfuckin' gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin' weight the shit is real smooth
A nigga's tryna play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten kis, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac got the fuckin' Glock cocked and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get a-WAY! Niggas got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass nigga got slayed, word up
By a crooked motherfucker named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch

Yeah, you don't stop!
Crooked ass niggas

Now I could be a crooked nigga too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked niggas, do!
I got a nine-millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin' mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin' piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these niggas knew, I'm a crooked nigga too

(Criminal behavior-- criminal-- criminal behavior)
Crooked ass niggas come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbing's what they specialize in

I Don’t Give A Fuck,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"— What's up?
— Yo, this scene: rollers tried to jack a nigga 'cause a nigga with a pearl rollin' on a Coupé with goldens
— Yo, man, what's up? This riding motherfucker, jack me at rollin' 'round bumping, ’cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?
— Yo, this is P-O to the G-O
— 
Motherfuckin' cop just jacked me, 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley
— What's up, man?
— A'ight, man, fuck 'em

I don't give a fuck
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And now I'm in the back on the paddy wagon
While this cop's bragging about the nigga he's jackin'
I see no justice, all I see is niggas dyin' fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly, 'cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But damn near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the motherfuckin' dope man
The Grammys and American Music shows
They pimp us like hoes, take our dough, but they hate us, though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck tryin' to get with these crooked-ass hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we gettin' respect, now
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I'm pissed, 'cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break! How much shit can a nigga take?
I ain't going nowhere, no how
Bush wanna throw down?
You better bring the gun, pal
'Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
From the motherfuckin' underground
So, step but you better step quick
'Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who do you think? A motherfuckin' 90's nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up, I had enough!
(Yeah) And I just don't give a fuck

Nigga, it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of motherfuckers dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and they attitude is shitty
So, tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city?
They say we niggas like to do niggas
So me and a cop are just two niggas
A street-walkin' nigga and a beat-walkin' nigga
With a badge, I end his future and his past
With a blast, take his cash before I dash, I bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
'Cause a nigga like P don't really give a fuck

Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a motherfucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit—ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere, but where?
’Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need?
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife-ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack? In fact, who's the blackjack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade, but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up, niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers: stay strong, keep your heads up

If My Homie Calls,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Saying we cousins, knowing that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope game, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call

""If you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all”
“Brothers and sisters”

It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
You got fame now you run with no shame
I chose rapping tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go, you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance, there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call

""If you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all”
“Brothers and sisters”

Well, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell, pal
But life making records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected, it's hectic, it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face to hide the trace of hate
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me, it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call

""If you ever need a place to stay""
“Well, alright, y'all”
“Brothers and sisters”",https://genius.com/2pac-if-my-homie-calls-lyrics
Part Time Mutha,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"She's a part time mutha

Meet Cindi
She's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic Tac
Now what's that say about this big epidemic
This hypocritical world and the people in it
Now speakin' of, in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust enough styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
'Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiendin' for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook; got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mother, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggas hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time

She's a part time mutha

I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, every night, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feelin' on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest and yes I was nervous
Was this a test? I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin' if she hasn't got a fix in, so
Now I lay me down to sleep, Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin' how my stepdad raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class and yet I'm missin' periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearin' it
I gotta tell mom before she sees me
I told her how he treated me and she didn't believe me
Callin' me a slut 'cause my butt's kinda big
 so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though
I can't believe the way he caught her
Got her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha

I gotta a part time

She's a part time mutha

I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock
She's gone and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
'Cause she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin' ever since
The clothes, the food, the cars and, oh, the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me this in the first place
So, I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream no more
Oh no, 
now I'm a part time mutha
And I change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha

She's a part time mutha",https://genius.com/2pac-part-time-mutha-lyrics
Rebel of the Underground,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"Rebel ... rebel
Rebel
Rebel ... rebel

They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
From a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain
So with a little bass and treble
Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic
, the maniac MC
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC
They won't be happy 'til I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face
Pump up the bass, and join the human race
I throw peace to The Bay
'Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground

Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground

Now I'm face to face with the devils
'Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
Shit, it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse
Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out
2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna
And doin' what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground

Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground
Rebel, he's a rebel
Rebel of the underground

They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me
In fact, they tryin' to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
'Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout
So what's wrong with the media today
Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid
But me? I'm comin' from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So, yo, to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin' records 'bout violence
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalypse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground

2Pac is a rebel
Rebel of the underground
2Pac is a rebel
Rebel of the underground
2Pac is a rebel
Rebel of the underground
2Pac is a rebel
Rebel of the underground

And those that max, relax, and let the blacks get jack
Are gettin' taxed, by packs and packs of angry blacks

Gettin' the hoes, clothes
Pumpin' the funk, thanks to the Hump
'Cause the nose knows
Check the pose, froze, when you see me close
Punks you gonna roast, host in a cloud of smoke
Broke, choked on some potent dank smoke
Wrote, rhymes that'll bring me bank notes
Nope, I ain't the type of fella that you're used to

They just gon' become souljas

Crack done took a part of my family tree
My momma's on the shit, my daddy split and moms is steady blaming me
Is it my fault, just cause I'm a young black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail 'til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
""Remember Rodney King?"" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case...
You speak of heaven punk? I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz' and a black mask
Ducking fuckin' Task, now who's the jackass?
Keep my shit cocked, cause the cops got a Glock too
What the fuck would you do? Drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin' the cop
I got me a Glock, and a Glock for the niggas on my block
Momma tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new king
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thing
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolin' in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps
A soulja

All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me

All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me

Buck, buck - niggas get fucked, don't step to this
Quiet as kept I'm blessed on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em to come and test, and arrest, nigga it's hectic
Here's the anorexic, I'm makin' it to an exit
Walking through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats, cause I'm on some pay 'em back shit
Niggas don't wanna try me, brother you'll get shot down
Now I'm king of the block, since my bigger brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin' him just be ready set
Pack ya shit up quick; and when I hit, be prepared to jet
Niggas from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke - pow!
These punks about to get hit by the best
I'm wearin' double vest... so aim at my fuckin' chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin' up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout
""Hit the pen nigga -- break your bigger brother out""
I got a message for the warden
I'm comin' for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gordon
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucker making death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin' out (BANG!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja

Tha’ Lunatic,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"Oh shit, jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve-inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee! This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin' motherfuckers' necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
Niggas get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps coming when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from tha' lunatic

Yeah, fuck that God! Word up
Blowin' niggas out the motherfuckin' frame, you know what I'm sayin'?
Constantly, fuck that trick, we ain't havin' it

Leave me the fuck alone, you get none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
'Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin' like Tyson
I'm grippin' the mic and my DJ is slicin'
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin' to me with the same old
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin' motherfuckers like a shootin' star
'Cause I'm out to show that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin', wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick like a motherfuckin' condom
Niggas wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a bitch, 'cause your whole fuckin' posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you get none of this
Feel the wrath, and revenge of tha' lunatic

Yeah Tu', tell 'em motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin' it, none of that shit!
Bitch ass niggas, niggas can't fuck with us Tu', word up
'91, we takin' this whole motherfucker over
Niggas got problems in '91, '92, and '93
And all that other shit, word up

Recognize game when it smacks you, bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin' shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel 'cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin' for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin' that he's ruthless
Ducked and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin'
Stop trippin' off these niggas 'cause they ain't about nuttin'
Or should I say naythin'
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of tha' lunatic

Ah yeah, fuck that, you know what I'm sayin'?

Yes Tu'!
Tell them niggas what time it is, 'kna'm sayin'?

Niggas can't fuck with us, word up
Bitch ass niggas, fuck 'em

Fuck all them niggas
I'm tellin' these niggas that they ain't got
Naythin' on a nigga like me

'92, '93, and so on
So let the beat float on
While I spray these punk bitches
With these dope ass lyrics

Trapped,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on the streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
Nine-millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me
'Cause they never taught peace in the black community
All we know is violence, do the job in silence
Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers, daily headed for the big pen'
Niggas comin' out worse-off than when they went in
Over the years I've done, a lot of growin' up
Gettin' drunk, throwin' up, cuffed up, then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out to money and fame
I changed my name, played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi
They got me trapped
[Chorus: Shock G & 
2Pac

Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

They got me trapped, can barely walk the city streets
Without a cop harasskin' me, searching me, then askin' my identity
Hands up, throw me up against the wall, didn't do a thing at all
I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on the concrete
Coppers try to kill me but they didn't know this was the wrong street
Bang bang, count another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality
Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain
He got caught in the chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?
Sweated me, hunted me, trapped in my own community
One day I'm gonna bust, blow up on this society
Why did you lie to me? I couldn't find a trace of equality
Worked me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
, it's time I let 'em suffer the payback
I'm tryin' to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped
[Chorus: Shock G &

Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
Trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

Now I'm trapped, and walkin' for my getaway
All I need is a G and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use the phone 'cause I'm sure someone is tapping in
Did it before, ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
But now he's the Devil's friend, too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and I'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away, I should've put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin', all I heard was the ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup saying ""Damn homies is dissin' you""
I fired my weapon, started steppin' in the hurricane
I got shot, so I dropped feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet, couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley, still lookin' for my getaway
Copper say, ""Freeze, or you'll be dead today.""
Trapped in a corner, dark and I couldn't see the light
Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living Hell
They got me trapped
[Chorus: Shock G &

Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down
They got me trapped
Naw, they can't keep the black man down

Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down

Violent,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"They claim that I'm violent just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits
 ’cause I'm not buyin' it
Defyin' it, envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor - and this is known as self-defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
’
Cause I'm the nigga that you sell-outs are ashamed to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil shit you did to me
They call me militant, racist, 'cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this!
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent

""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

""Just because we play what the people want""

The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, ""Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?""
He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew
(""Do you know what time it is?
Get out the fucking car, or I'll hurt you!"")
Get out the car - or I'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)
(""What you doin man?"")
They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked (""I'm out"") he tried to run
(Freeze nigga!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(Argh, fuck you! Ungh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste, of 
trading places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent

""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (Damn!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (Damn!) we in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
(that's a lotta of one time)
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
(yeah, it's on now)
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own fuckin' weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops
You fuck with real niggas, get ya fuckin' ass dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
(What's next man?) What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
(Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent

""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""
""They claimin' that I'm violent""
""Fuck the damn cop!""
""Just because we play what the people want""

Words of Wisdom,2Pacalypse Now,1991,"Killing us one by one
In one way or another
America will find a way to eliminate the problem, one by one
The problem is the troublesome Black youth of the ghettos
And, one by one, we are being wiped off the face of this Earth
At an extremly alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact that we are not fighting back
Brothers, sisters, niggas
When I say ""nigga"" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But, to me
It means ""Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished"", nigga
Niggas, what are we going to do?
Walk blind into a line or fight?
Fight and die if we must
Die, like niggas

This is for the masses, the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're superior
Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya
Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that that refuses to respect us
Emancipation Proclamation? Please!
Lincoln just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy
The constitution, yo, it don't apply to me
And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me
This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'
But its wrong to keep someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching children
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty

This is definitely uh... words of wisdom
AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people
I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?

Words of Wisdom
Based upon the strength of a nation
Conquer the enemy armed with education
Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do
Know thyself, teach by what we've been through
Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?
’Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime
But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line
The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable
They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe
’Cause it will strangle ya
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
You swear to your mother that you living in equality
Forgetting your brother that's living here in poverty
Thought they had us beaten when they took out King
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom

NIGHTMARE! That's what I am
America's Nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and the evil that you gave me
I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people
For four hundred plus years
You should be scared
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
Ha, but you can not escape fate
For it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you will fall
By my hands
America, you reap what you sow

I try to effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat 'cause cops wanna jack
And fuck going to jail
'Cause I ain't a crook, despite how I look
I don't sell yayo
They judging a brother like covers on books
So follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hitting 'em out of the doors
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fucking the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts, the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddaya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says ho
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check
Now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real niggas bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales of young black males

Yes, nigga, N-I-G-G-A, niggas
Ay, nigga, you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!
Hit that shit, that's the shit!
It smells like skunk, skunk smells like that nigga momma
We ain't nothin' but some low down dirty niggas
Keep it real, nigga! Fuck you, nigga!
You ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ides, it's an Old E thing, baby
Strictly some of that Hennessy
Can I drink with you, fellas? Can I get in on it?
Fuck you, Capo, you ain't in, baby

And I don't need a posse, my Glocks like a pocket full of Rockies
Takin' out the cop team

Fifty to the first that can drop me
Better talk it like ya walk it when we swing 'em

Motherfuck god, I diss 'em on wax
Catch 'em slippin' backstage start fadin' they ass
Oops there goes that ghetto mentality

Fuck the humble
Got this stamina to be on the mic
Mashin' in the stance you style's the 
I'm about to catch a bulge in my pants
And the bigger the butt, the bigger the nut that I mistrust
I can catch a bum rush layin' in the cut
Like a panther on the prowl, searchin' for agile, don't ask scoop
You're not a now, but I'll tellin' MC how we should
Take ya time, take ya, take ya, take ya time
Mc's take ya time before ya start the rhyme

Big Tyme,Unreleased Songs,1992,"""Impossibbbbbbbblllllleeeeee, take your love from me""

I thought the Earth saw, saw it all
I thought they wasn't ready for no more?
It's time for a new beginning
For every action, there's a reaction
Lost in golden pyramids outside
At first we were the 'have-nots'
The hunger even had some go out and Bag watch
But then the Jag dropped
What the fuck I'm supposed to do?
Go out and snatch blocks?
And hand out bricks, connect and politic like a Jew
I'd rather do it the classic way, like Cassius Clay
I'm the next sub to do this nobody after me
The sky's cracked with the force of my words
Here's the lesson, we the ones y'all forever knowing, hearing the essence
Peep the planets how they all connecting
And my clique next to spit, who they resurrecting?
Yo check this shit, I ain't got lifetimes to recite lines
The pipelines was sent to ya with the right mind
Let the light shine
Keep ya shades on, 'cause it's the Amazon
E-MoneyBags, Grand Imperial the label
Check my vision
I'm playing my part in this division
'Til we big time, engraved in stone we'll be printed,yo

Pull a card, here comes the Squad
Sure to bomb, never lost when I've sparred
Its hard 'cause I'm God!
And comes off the top
Don't they know a nigga got flavour
Mad 'cause I'm sharp as a razor
Bockin' when I'm walkin', always tryna take a niggas fucking picture
Embarassed when my lawyers gettin with ya
I'm robbin' ya life, rather jumbo
The thuggadon niggas, that incredible dope flow
I remain smooth, cops can't find no evidence
So I'll just laugh, look at my fucking dead presidents
Sending me decoys with marked money frontin' yo
What you need G? Nah, I ain't got nuttin'
I say ""Give up ya gun""
Is what I tell 'em then I step
Wouldn't be top dog if I was one who slept
So show respect
I'm beyond that, livin' like Trump
The only difference is a nigga's never in a slump
Tax free is what it be G
Stacking while I'm macking
The Squad is Big Time if you wanna be exactin'
Dealin' with keys, you see these on the mad tip
Act like you want it and we'll have to just wreck shit

Kick rhymes, baby just recognise (Repeat)

""Impossibbbbbbbblllllleeeeee, take your love from me""

Check it
We like master monks, moulding niggas to perfection
Target 4 corners, conquer every section
Rizzers of the underworld, this Thug Nation
We got our own codes, every type can relate to me
And how we keep it? Deeper than the deepest secret, in the FBI files
Organize to crack vials
New Thug Order money getting submerged
Cross the border, politic with peace pipes
Puffin' on that green water
Fuck what you heard, we moving the birds
Quantity large, busting at the sarge never follow me
Extreme measures, to finance the movement
Smash the diamond district, snatch the jewels quick
My inspiration, hundred percent dedication
Thug Nation be the final destination

Some say cracks the only way to get your papers
Prepare to catch the vapors
I'm violating niggas like a rapist
The coppers couldn't catch us with a net
The one you love to sweat
How crooked can a motherfucka get?
2Pacalypse Now's a real knucker
I'm slick and quick to pick her upper
After I fuck her then I duck her
Young Gunz niggas got 'em frantic
They just can't understand it
We get wrecked across the planet
Beeper goes off I hit the cellular
Coppers wanna gat me, they can't sweat me so the hell wit' cha!
You get the dick quick while I'm getting rich, bitch
Tried a lunatic, I flip and do some slick shit
Nigga, 
I'm like Gotti, give me body
Rob you for your drugs then put slugs in your hottie
(Yeah!)
And ain't nobody that can stop me
I'm rollin' with the Squad motherfucker damn posse
Come get your ass rolled up, I kid ya not
This shit I got I'll have ya sewed up
16 shots come and get mine
Fuck you motherfuckers 'cause I'm finally livin' Big Time!

Hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it

And after she's crossed out
I shout, ""I'm de MC wit' de nasty mouf!"" and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin' pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin' shit
Pickin' pockets with a razor stoppin' Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin' shop
Once you sound hot, 'cause if you ain't a perfect ten
My sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin' styles in 'em
Like women I did 'em I'm in for deadly ready venom

Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Maj
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin' 'em down, I make 'em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
Rob and steal and runnin' from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
MAC-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped 'til my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin' bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make 'em scatter, leavin' trails of brains and bladders
Blowin' 'em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
Something I don't wanna do, something that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit 'em, I lit him
He's out! A poison, a deadly venom

Yeah Maj, fuck that! You know how we do
Know I'm sayin'? Squad in effect, YG'z in effect
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent
You know I'm sayin'? Check it out

Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggas can't touch me when I wreckin' G you better flee
'Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking all fake niggas back to the stomping grounds
Line 'em up single file, dome runnin' in 'em
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom

Nigga, ya know I'm sayin'? Fuck that!
I told you, we takin' over, yo 'Pac

Five deadly venoms verse five be the livest
Strugglin' and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggas don't even worry me, see
I got a Glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops 'cause my gauge gets me— paid!
As I sit and reminisce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggas need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everyday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I passed let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now your mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin' blunts
Deadly venoms

Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here
Apache bout to clean shit up

Throw up your middle finger! Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm giving out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin' trigger
I'm a cinch in a clinch, your punch is like a pinch
Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin' up pooh-butts, cut 'em like cold cuts
Choke 'em with my boot lace, then leave 'em hangin' like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get 'em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim

Yeah, Ya know I'm sayin'?
Five motherfuckin deadly venoms, in effect for '93
'94, '95 all that other shit
We takin this motherfucker over this larger hit
Ya know I'm sayin'? Follow us, come along, ya know I'm sayin'?
We takin this motherfucker over, trust, we out",https://genius.com/2pac-5-deadly-venomz-lyrics
Guess Who’s Back,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,1993,"Guess who's back?

Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the Moët
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, it's like a hobby
But more like a job, cause 
bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, ""Hi,""
 and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test
Of givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
By Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back but now I snap, where they at?

One minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, 
cause they hate my black tape
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, it's a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, niggas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'mma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back? 
No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get a grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick. Guess who's back?

From block to block we snatching hearts and jacking marks
And the punk police can't fade me and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
'Cause it's time to make the payback fat
Tell my brothers on the block–better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got a nigga smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!

To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin' in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin' all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble

Holler if ya hear me!

'Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise to all my boys

Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me

I Get Around,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,1993,"Round and round (aw yeah)
Round and round, round we go (I get around)
Round and round
Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
(Step up, step-step up, step up)
Round and round, round we go (stronger than ever)
Round and round

Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down
Baby doll, check it out: I get around

What you mean you don't know?
Round and round, around we go
I get around, the Underground just don't stop for hoes
Round and round
I get around, still down with the Underground
Round and round, around we go
I get around, yeah, ayo Shock, let them hoes know
Round and round

Now you can tell from my everday fits I ain't rich
So cease and desist with them tricks (tricks)
I'm just another black man caught up in the mix (mix)
Tryna make a dollar out of 15 cents (a dime and a nickel)
Just cause I'm a freak don't mean that we could hit the sheets
Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

What's up, love? How you doin'? (all right)
Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (uhh)
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown
We can keep in the down low long as you know that I get around

Round and round, around we go
2Pacalypse Now don't stop for hoes, I get around
Round and round
Round and round, around we go
Why I ain't call you? Hahahah, please!
Round and round

Fingertips on the hips as I dip
Gotta get a tight grip, don't slip; loose lips sink ships
It's a trip, I love the way she licks her lips, see me jockin'
Put a little twist in her hips ‘cause I'm watchin'
Conversations on the phone 'til the break of dawn
Now we're all alone, why the lights on?
Turn them off! Time to set it off, get you wet and soft
Somethin' is on your mind, let it off
You don't know me, you just met me, you won't let me
Well, if I couldn't have it (silly rabbit) why you sweatin' me?
It's a lot of real G's doin' time
Cause a groupie bent the truth and told a lie
You picked the wrong guy, baby, if you're too fly
You need to hit the door, search for a new guy
'Cause I only got one night in town
Break out or be clowned, baby doll are you down?

Keep Ya Head Up,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,1993,"Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin

Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier

Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)

Bucking down your crew, muthafuck you

UHH, am I a G? I got proof
Banged in my youth, keep niggas on the roof

Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Muthafucker rednecks all the same

That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand, divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
Keeping the smile off they White face
I ain't racist but let's trade places

Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the
 FUCK off, POPS.. FUCK YOU!

Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
The things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)

For all this time, so sorry baby!
[Verse 2: Wycked & 
2Pac
]
Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother;
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away? Tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his papa wasn't man enough;
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
Unless you got the time it's a crime; don't even bother
That's when I started hatin' the phony smiles
Said I was an only child
Look at mama's lonely smile!
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know
That I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale or pops was wrong?
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
Talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
But it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
!
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that ""Born to be a father"" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me: all alone, G
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!

I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was a danger;
If I wanted to to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move on, done lost my name and picked a number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
All I ever wanted was for you to be a man
And grow to be the titan you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...

I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)

Peep Game,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,1993,"So what the fuck you talkin about?! Aw, shit
Goody, goody, gumdrops
Nigga, get your hoodie and your gun cocked
Rock it till the drum stops, hip hop
Even if my shit flip flop
It probably wouldn't stop, talk shit and get socked
How ya hang em?
Know a realer nigga? You could bring him
If I don't represent the shit, I'll kick it
We could sway him, hunh! As if I know ya
Then I could show ya
But if I don't know, I gotta .44 fo' ya
So, so peep game, at point blank range
The fame can't change what the game maintains
Strange! Went against the grain
Aw shit! Flick or no flick I trips for no bitch
Catch up on your pimpin', I ain't simpin', I'm a diss her
Couldn't be my sister if she's actin' like I missed her
Tell me why they, tell me why they, tell me why they play me
Don't these niggas know that neither one of y'all can fade me
I ain't big, I ain't buff, I ain't deisel
But fuck wit 2Pac and pop goes the weasel
Me and Threat made a bet on how many fellas
Would jock a mothafuckin' real nigga cause they jealous
They do it for the fame
Explain, insane 
What's in a name? What's in a name?
Peep game

Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style
Put it together like a puzzle builder
If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

Killa Cali
The state where they kill
Down wit Oaktown? What's up homie, can I chill?
The bitches lookin funny
Film at elev,film at eleven wit they minds on they heaven
Wit they .357
-Where you at?
*On the freeway, leaving LA
-OK, see you when get here loc
*OK
-Here I am. Here I am
*Goddamn that was quick
-Told ya I was comin. Who is that? Is that your woman?
*Na, that's just a hoochie looking for some juice
-What's up my nigga? What ya know? A nigga got a little bigger
That's all folks know
Fat gold ropes
Gotta keep a low key for my attack
When I approach, I want the diamonds, the pearls
The round the way girls
Cuz baby got, baby got back out this world
Would you give a fee? Never
Fly like a feather
Make more money than your daddy and your mama put together
The game is to be sold, not to be told
So buy it
Can't afford it?
Low budget hoes gotta brother
Peep game

Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style
Put it together like a puzzle builder
If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

Don't sell out
Get the hell out
Cause here I come
Hit em with my bop gun
They came and they blast
We got witt they ass
And oh, pop this vest and all the rest of that mess
Comin through like Terminater 2
Boost your crew cuz we ain't afraid of you
You know what time it is wit me once the clock stike 3
We goin coo-coo for Cocoa Puffs. Whooo eeii!!!

Punk bitch, how ya like me now?
Can't fuck around wit the funky style

If Threat don't get cha, Pac gon' kill ya

Time to get paid, time to get paid, check
Time to represent the west homie, nuttin' but a vest on me
Got my hands on my Glock, eyes on the prize
First sucka jump, first nigga die
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme mine like I told ya
Hard as a boulder
Motha fuckin soulja
Boom bam boom!! It's a stick up

Point the Finga,Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...,1993,"""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""
Ahh yeah, they love to point the finger
""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""

I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggas need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin' major pay
But when I get my check they takin' tax out
So, we payin' for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin' rich
Whoopin' on thugs and robbin' drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein' a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell 'em your soul or they'll be on ya til a nigga's ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a lawsuit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin' ass marks in the park
For tryin' to earn they stripes in the dark
Just 'cause I come there, don't mean I'm from there, peep
Only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""

As I run up on em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggas run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom! Let that ass sleep
It's gettin' hectic, niggas run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggas on the block tryin to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin' to sleep
I'm steady pumpin' bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin', nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
At 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
Of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga

Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
""You could get the finger, (""Come and get some!"") the middle!""
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch

One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin back to the crack game

Niggas wanna start a little ruckus
Better duck cause I'll be poppin' them motherfuckers
They wanna throw their hands up, that's tight
Hit em wit my eight, never had shit left, right

Mad motherfuckers
Never had so we grab from the stacked motherfuckers
Now they know me, the homies
Raised by some crazed ass well payed OG's
Ah shit! Pulled up in a benzy, snatch
The wheel as I peel out. Catch a cop's tail
Rock shells hit. Raise a fist so they know to make a hit
Can I flip it? I may get wicked as I rip it
To get specific: If the shoe fits, then kick it
It's for the gifted, pump your fist if you wit it
Here's your ticket to see Mr. Wicked rip shit

Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah, Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is back
And I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin'?
Puffin' on this indo
In the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean?

I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
'Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send 'em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggas
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggas
Straight fools into rules and do niggas
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen, punk, picture that
I stay strapped, motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein' me, I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin' at a night club?
Nothin' but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got and get shot with the hot ones
And, aw yeah, I wanna feel guilty
But you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the ear with my phone or my pager
It's beepin' while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggas tryin' to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it

Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin' records
That's what they said whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though, always kept my head up high
Eventually I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said ""Bet!,"" and never let 'em see me sweat
'Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
While non-believers were prayin' for my downfall
And some would call and tell me that they wish me well
But in my heart, I'm knowin' that they wish me hell
Yo, get a real job, rappin' doesn't pay the rent
I hit the studio, 'cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it 'til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car note
And when you reminisce, thinkin' how you got dissed
Remember how it felt and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
'Cause they can all suck dick, it's strictly for my niggas

Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my, strictly for my, strictly for my niggas
Strictly for my niggas, makin' G's

This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin' stick-ups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not, 2Pac will cop the Glock and come knockin' to getcha
I told you once, motherfucker, I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin' when you're fucked
Niggas know what's up but they be tryin' to hold me down
I'm comin' outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore, nigga
It's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin' all that shit
Screamin' out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggas that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin' trigger
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome, niggas tried to play me with the gat
But like Terminator, nigga, I'll be back
Yeah, and I'll be back with a fuckin' army
You tried to harm me, ring the alarm, G
'Cause most motherfuckers love to act up, without they backup
When they get jacked up, they crack up

I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin'

Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggas on they back
Till I call back, niggas running free better fall back
I'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my sheets
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed

Where every other had a pops and a motha
I was the product of a heated lover
Nobody knew how deep it screwed me
And since my pops never knew me
My family didn't know what to do with me
Was I somebody they despised?
Curious look in they eyes
As if they wonder if I'm dead or alive
And poor momma can't control me
""Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!""
A tickin' timebomb, can't nobody fade me
Packin' a 380 and fiendin' for Mercedes
Suckers scatter but it don't matter I'm a cool shot
Punks drop from all the buckshots the fools got
I'm tired of being a nice guy
I've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
So they label me a lunatic
Could care less, death or success
Is what I quest 'cause I'm fearless
Now the streets are deathrow

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow

I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed, wearin' a vest
Hopin' that they're aimin' at my chest
Much too young to bite the bullet
Hand on the trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
Counting pennies over the years I'd done stacked many
Proving wrong those
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
Now they gotta cope
Since it's the only thing I know
It's difficult to let it go
I'm startin' to lose my hair 'cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
But now I gotta move away now
'Cause these suckers love ta' spray where I lay down
My homie lost his family, he snapped;
Shot up half the block to bring them back
The streets are deathrow

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')

I'm dangerous when drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Hennessy makes me think my enemy is getting close
BOOM BOOM BOOM
Got me shooting at a ghost
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out west and I invest in all the best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put to rest, by a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke, on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking comin' from a broken family?
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, bodybags, and the guns firin'
Tell Bush, ""Push the button!"" 'cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
The streets are deathrow

('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
('cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow

Just watch the fear reappear in they eyes when I hit the set
Oh no, 2Pac wit' team Tyson, Seldon was seldom seen
Iron Mike cut his head like a guillotine
Time for some action, you're makin' me high, like Toni Braxton
Bustas switching like Dennis Rodman, we still mashin'
I put my hand up to God, life is hard, filled with stress
Throwing blows in this square, circle to see who's best
Mike don't hurt 'em! What they scream, wait! What they mean?
Tyson put in work, his head touched the whole Colosseum
Better act up when I see him, we loud in the front row
Hype up the crowd if you don't like it, what you come for?
All hail, to fortified to fail
The Bed-Stuy ass kicker, split the water like a sharks tail
Still strugglin', may god help me bubble
Hit the ring, do my thing, all opposed feel trouble
Get it on!

Let's get ready to rumble
Haha, let's do this (yea)
Let's get ready to rumble (you know)
Let's get it on
Throw ya hands up, throw ya hands up
Where they at? Where they at?

Round 2
Right, left then left, right I seen him stutter WHAT?
He didn't duck and got stuck wit' yo' uppercut!
Now hear the crowd screaming, It's like they fiendin'
Oh, don't you love how that black man swing?
We keep it real, tell Holyfield, he next in line
So get his heart problem checked 'fore he steps to mine
And Seldon, I hardly know ya, don't bother me to show ya
Let ya head get gassed by that fast promoter
Be real forever, so feel my leather in combinations
Connecting like dot to dot in steady formations
Swift and deadly, 'cause this be deathly
I'm a soldier, it's too late now, I tried to told ya
Get it on!

Let's get ready to rumble
YES! YES! (huhu)
Let's get it on
Aight this ain't goin' last long, y'all know how Tyson do it
So what, we gon' watch him beat this boy silly (hehhe)
And then we go all, go party at 66 deuce mob style
So Tyson do you thang boy... do ya thang
Let's get it on now (so whatcha want?)
Yes, let's get it on (whatcha want, now?)
Let's get ready to rumble!! (whatcha want?)
Let's get it on now (UH, whatcha want, now?)

Peep Game Part 2,Unreleased Songs,1993,"Damn
Hey, close yo' muthafuckin' mouth...
Shut yo' muthafuckin' mouth!
This is how we going to to this in '94
Here we go
Time to size these niggas up and cut they ass short, yow know?
Mothafuckers got me going for it
Fuck these niggas
DING!

Momma ain't raised no punks
Playa-hate niggas, pay attention, this is what they want
Since you all up in a nigga mix
Then maybe you can hang with the street game, don't be a bitch
Keep your head up, baby, and I meant that
Now you trying to toss me in the mix, and bitch, I resent that
These hoes ain't shit
Plottin' on a nigga 'cause he rich
Then wonder why they call you bitch
And if you offended, you's a lyin' ass trick and that was intended
I'm coming back with a passion
And screaming 'Thug Life,' bitch
When my niggas get the blastin'
I'm puttin' hoes on tape, and not 'cause I wanna, but I gotta
'Cause tramps love to scream ""rape!""
I'm rushing bitches to the hotel
And I'm blindfolding hoes I don't know well
Huh, guess it's hard on a nigga in '94
If you can find a ho, nigga, peep game

Tell me what you need when you see me
Ducking these tramps 'cause they sleazy
Bitch, take it easy
I told you last year it's a test
I know you can't see my tattoos through my bullerproof vest
So you roll, baby, hold up
And why you touchin' on a nigga
If I touched you back, you'd probably go nuts
You see, you hoes got it all wrong
Shouldn't listen to them niggas that be bangin' on them slow songs
That's where you go wrong
I ain't never been a trick
Fake bitch, keep yo' clothes on
With you're mouth closed, and you're leg shut
If I was broke, you'd probably wouldn't said much
But I'm paid, so you all in a nigga face
You wanna move in, fuck, get a bigger place
Please, I ain't goin' out like these, trick ass niggas that be fuckin' off G's
You suckas need your game plan changed
And peep game...",https://genius.com/2pac-peep-game-part-2-lyrics
Pain,Above the Rim - The Soundtrack ,1994,"I couldn't help but notice your pain
My pain?
It runs deep – share it with me!

They'll never take me alive, I'm gettin' high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckas, time to die
Even as a youngster causin' ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school, kickin' up dust
But now I'm labeled as a troublemaker – who can you blame?
Smokin' weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless, rollin' down the freeway swervin', don't worry
I'm 'bout to crash up on the curb ‘cause my vision's blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me – what should I do?
I had to feed my fuckin' family – what else could I do
But be a thug? Out slangin' with the homies
Fuck hangin' with them phonies in the clubs!
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang-bangers and drive-by's
Why do we die at an early age?
He was so young, but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't goin' back to court, so fuck what you thought!
I'm drinkin' Hennessy, runnin' from my enemies
Will I live to be 23? There's so much pain

Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain

Years and years of that rough life
Runnin' crazed and wild as a kid and growin' tough with a knife
And livin' trifed on the regular, buckin' out competitors
See 'em fake a move and chase 'em down like the fuckin' Predator
Get in trouble every day in school, act a fool
And you know I had to break every rule
Showin' off for the bitches ‘cause I had the mad rep
So I had to watch my back when it was time to step
But my grimies is the grimiest with love for me
Pop, pop, pop, and send a chuckle up above for me
Ayo, currency kept passin' me by, but I didn't cry, broke
Got hit off with the pack and started sellin' coke
And now the money's lookin' lovely
Pop the drop top and now the bitches wanna rub me
Kick 'em the game, it's all the same
I kick it back yo, give 'em slack yo
And now they label me the mack yo, people check it
Get disrespected if you front on the Birdman, you heard, man
Catch a couple shots from the Glock in my hand
Damn! At least I'm realistic with my biscuit
You know you get yo' ass twisted, so run for cover
Me and my man got a plan, kickin' major dust
So if you owe, nigga, look for the gauge to bust
A lot of pressure with the street fame, it's a deep game
And my mama always cryin' yo, there's so much pain

Ohhhh…
So tired, so tired...
Ohhhh…
So...so...

They got me mobbin' like I'm loc'ed, and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust – I got my Glock cocked, playa, if they press me
Bust – on motherfuckers with a passion
Better duck, ‘cause I ain't lookin' when I'm b-blastin'
I'm a nut and drinkin' Hennessy
And gettin' high, on the lookout for my enemies
Don't wanna die, tell me why? ‘Cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck 50 across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone?
I keep my brain on the game and stay headstrong
These sorry bastards wanna kill me in my sleep
I'm real, they cannot see, and every day is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets, and I'll be ballin', loc
Don't let 'em make you worry, keep swingin' at these suckas 'til you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother, I'm touched
Out kickin' dust up, ready to bust
I'm on the scene, steady muggin' mean, until they kill me
I'll be livin' this life, I know you feel me; there's so much pain

Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhh…
Tired of the strain and the pain
Ohhhhhh…",https://genius.com/2pac-pain-lyrics

Bury Me a G II,Unreleased Songs,1994,"Bury me a G

Tell me how can I survive? Remember me?
Life as a G, these money making activities is killin' me
I'm tryna ball, but the alcohol making me hurl
Paranoid like it's me against the world, will I live or die?
My only question: When I ride will I be murdered?
A victim of some homicide, did I deserve it?
My life is full of misery, forgive me Lord
The streets are full of enemies, watch over me
Intoxicated, I can barely see
I can't sleep, having dreams someone's killing me, am I sane?
My life is pain and I'm stressing, brothas be trippin'
They open fire where I rest, hopin' for death
But I'm still livin' every breath, won't be for me
Retaliation every death, let's make 'em bleed
'Cause do or die is the only way
And though I pray, I can see you getting sicker every day

And I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
See, I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

Something 'bout this game that keep a shorty holla for pain
But when they jock from the front I'ma do my thing
I got problems, so I loc'd up, when they killed my parents
Gettin'  'em so I took the hit for granted
And a revolver will be my only hope for escape
Talking 'bout going insane, but the feeling can wait
Who can you blame on these inner-city streets?
They screaming out ""Peace!"", but everybody is deceased
Just bury me a G

Nah, I ain't afraid, just pray that I make top-grade
In the stray, getting paid is the way I play (what?) for keeps
While beef creeps on we got be holding mine
Down from sundown all through the sunshine
They gettin' blasted massive, taking lavish
Thoughts of running countable cabbage
See, I can bury me fly, feelin' my high
Well, I ain't gon' lie
Don't cry 'cause we all gotta meet up in the sky
True G

I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
Said I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

Every day I'm caught up in this paper chase
Just like I miss, will I be crazed when I see my grave?
Stress is someone that's half from all angles like 
Where bangers running they mouth not to get strangled
But who am I to talk? I know my time is coming for
Next week it'll probably be me that's underlined in chalk
Terrible thought, but tell my man, sold the potent next time
 let it pour for your dawg
Bury me a G

Now I went from a criminal with crooked schemes
Now look it seems
They wanna bury me in a hurry
And in my dreams, it's getting drastic op
I picture a plastic gloves
Imaginary spots where casket drops
I laughed at cops that harass my pops
They couldn't last the shot
Tryna get cash, I just stashed you knots
In one day I be done and ready for son
With memories of my fingertips, keeping my lips numb
Retired early out this game with the fortune and fame
That carry on my street name, bury me a G

Said I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
I said I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G

Ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me
Mama don't cry, bury me a G
And I ain't got time for snitches
Gotta keep my mind on my money and my riches
Even when I die, they don't worry me

In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreamin'
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearin' hoochies screamin'
Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

Can U Get Away,Me Against the World,1995,"Whassup? It's 2Pac. Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up
(You know I got a man)
I know you got a man, but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out
(Of course he gon' mind)
Let me take you to lunch, I'll have you back before he even get home, before anybody see
(I can't, he ain't gon' let me
Aww c'mon! Pleeeeeease...
(Nah)
Oh aight – what's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?

Ever since I met ya I could peep the pressure
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't 'bout no suckin' and touchin', just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations – would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
The anticipation of love makin'
Got you shakin' when I'm standin' near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's gettin' clearer
All he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave him, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone
And find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate – but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me, can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon… Let's go… Can you get away?
Can you get away?

So much pressure in the air (I know, I know)
And I can't get away (Just for a little while love)
I'm not happy here (I know it's hard but, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air
(Let's go man, get up outta there, can you get away?)
And I can't get away (Do you love him?)
I'm not happy here (Do you love that man?)

Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
Ain't checkin' for these hoochies that be on me
‘Cause they phony
But you was different, I got no need to be suspicious
‘Cause I can tell, my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin' here hopin' that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits, gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance when it's my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses when he ain't lookin'
Now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow
Come see tomorrow
Hopin' I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care – that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste
We can hook up at the store. Can you get away?

So much pressure in the air (I know it is)
And I can't get away (Yeah, you can)
I'm not happy here (You ain't happy, huh? Can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (I know… is he beatin' on you?)
And I can't get away (Did he punch you?)
I'm not happy here (Throwin' you around the house?)

I sit here reminiscin' and I hope you listenin'
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
‘Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home – that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do? Don't wanna lose you to this sucker
‘Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya, but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows, on who controls will it last?
Before I ask, I hope you see that I'm sincere
And even if you stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up, ‘cause I believe in what we share
You're livin' in prison and what he's givin' can't compare
‘Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passionately yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me, can you get away?

So much pressure in the air (Can't get away why?)
And I can't get away
I'm not happy here
(Let me take you away, all I wanna know, can you get away?)
So much pressure in the air (Man)
And I can't get away (Course you can get away)
I'm not happy here
(If you really wanted to get away, you could get away)

You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
With this old half a man, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I ain't tryin' to put you in a position
Where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
You need, but now… he ain't even takin' care of you
He beatin' on you and shit; look how you look!
You too motherfuckin' raw to be with that nigga
Ya know what I'm sayin'?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
Ya know what I'm sayin'? You need to be on first class
Need to be goin' to Hawaii, seein' the world
Seein' what this world got to offer you
Not goin' to, ya know what I'm sayin'?
The emergency room, gettin' stitches
‘Cause this nigga done got jealous. Don't cry, it's all good

Can you take me from here?
Shake that man, get away
Can you take me from here?
I'ahhhhhm unhappy here

Dear Mama,Me Against the World,1995,"You are appreciated
When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home, I was a fool
With the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back, but the plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy, ‘cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, ‘cause my anger
Wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs
And even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, ‘cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
‘Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
‘Cause through the drama I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back, but my plan
Is to show you that I understand: you are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, lady (Dear Mama)
Lady, lady",https://genius.com/2pac-dear-mama-lyrics
Death Around the Corner,Me Against the World,1995,"Child: Why you by the window? What's wrong daddy?
Mother: I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He just stand by the goddamn window
With that fuckin' AK all day (there you go)
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't eat
You don't even do a goddamn thing

I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the - corner, any day
Tryin to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin' and strivin', my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I'm thinkin' 'bout my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of indo and my mind can't take the stress, I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self; but I see death around the corner

(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")

I see death around the corner, the pressure's gettin' to me
I no longer trust my homies - them phonies tried to do me
Smokin' too much weed, got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest, under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin' I die the way I lived, straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas that was buggin'
My homie told me once, don't you trust them other suckers
They front like they your homies but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who'd care
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
Got homies in my head that done passed away screamin' ""Please!""
Young nigga, make G's
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless, I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner

(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")

(I was raised) I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kiddy
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household
And drinkin' liquor til' you out cold
And though I'm grown now, nigga it's still on - Pow!
Bustin on them niggas 'til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin' for my riches
Now I gotta be suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless, them bitches'll start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murder me now but see me later man,
 
that's on my pops
I got homies that will hunt you 'til you drop
I hope the Lord can forgive me
I was a G and gettin' high was a way of bein' free
I see death around the corner

(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner
(""When we were kids, belonging felt good.."")
I see death around the corner
(""But having respect, that feels even better.."")
I see death around the corner

This is for all the real motherfuckin' niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die; we all gotta go, y'know?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin' business
(
You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money
You fuckin hump?
)
Y'all niggas stop actin' like pussies out there, all right
If any of you..
Are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that...
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!
I want his family dead! I want his house burnt to the ground!
I wanna go there in the middle of the night I wanna piss on his ashes!

Fuck the World,Me Against the World,1995,"Who you callin' rapist? Ain't that a bitch
You devils are so two faced
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
And gettin' stalked by these crooked cops again
Fuckin' with the young Black male, tryin' to stack bail
And um, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
And that's why I had that .45 with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!

They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screamin' ""Fuck the world!""
They tryna say that I don't care
Just woke up and screamed ""Fuck the world!""
They tryna say that I don't care
Uhh, I woke up and screamed ""Fuck the world!""
They're tryna say that I don't care
Just got up and screamed ""Fuck the world!""

When I was comin' up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin' flex to me, comin' from my enemies
And in their dreams it's hell where they sendin' me
Have I lost control or just another soul?
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin' on 'gnac as I sit back, life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say ""you did that?""
Never take your eyes off the prize and even if you gettin' high
Don't ever hesitate to try
'Cause you can fall off or stay ballin', niggas, we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin'

(Man, Fuck the world)
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
Cause I'm sittin' here sippin' on Guinness
Weighin' 165 and these tricks should die
For being jealous of a brother when he rise
I can see it in your eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin'
They hate to see a nigga ballin'
Some of you suckers is rotten, plottin' on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (Booyeah)
Stop givin' game for free, you wanna hang with me
Like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, Fuck the world!

They tryna say that I don't care
I woke up screamed ""Fuck the world!""

I hear my niggas screamin' ""Fuck the world""

They wanna know if I claim the clique that I'm hangin' with
And if I'm down with this bangin' shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through hell and back and if I fail, black
Then it's back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggas is bustas, you runnin' round
With these tramp-ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!

Heavy in the Game,Me Against the World,1995,"Oh, you Thug Life is yours?
Life ain't no something you can rap with
Ooh come no ordinary game
The game no something you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars..
Every time, seen?

Now how can I explain how this game laced me, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryna make a livin'
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin' they riches on scandalous bitches, who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, player-hatin' but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin' through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies since they jealous, I hustle solo
'Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no broke nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game

(Game's been good to me)
Who the bumba clat him a come try take mine?
Oh, me see you rushin' up 
(Game's been good to me)
I throw I'm blood claat P.M. to A.M
All, all the bumba come ya take dis ting
For ya take dis ting for joke?
Oh, that's right 
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)

(Well let me shoot some of this how heavy type of shit)
Certain niggas wanna stick to the game, you's a trick to the game
Waitin' upon your turn, son when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggas be twistin' and takin' shit
Puttin' they sack down, then puttin' they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be your own nigga meanin' buy your own dope
'Cause that front shit is punk shit, something I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin' and robbin', despisin' your homie
Ain't healthy, niggas be endin' up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin' somethin' major
So what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga livin' residential
To a, young nigga workin' presidential

(Game's been good to me)
Me nigga Tu-pac always look good
You know that's true I'm look good every time
Ooh, pussy war?, step up 
(Game's been good to me)
Can yi know I'm serving up blood claat
Playing yi fucking games
Ooh, we take game, we won!
(I don't care what it did to them)
Any by now
(The game's been good to me)
All, yi haffa forget fi we won!
Every time

I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail is out here doin' dirt
My decisions do or die, been hustlin' since junior high
No time for askin' why, gettin' high, gettin' mine
Put away my nine, 'cause these times call for four-five shells
'Cause life is hell, and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise
Them loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives
Shoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin' to make the news
Niggas confused, quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself
Go with the grain then, come into riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game

(Game's been good to me)
Boy, ya nah bitch!
Major that's true we look good every time
When we at Beers Diamond
And 2Pac drives vintage car 
(Game's been good to me)
And fi them frame them look good, oh no?
This whole world ya call on
Gonna mass on a face
For any, section of bumba ras claat, oh!

(The game's been good to me)
Flush it!.. Oh!
Nobody wan come test me ya know
True them we a drive pretty car

If I Die 2Nite,Me Against the World,1995,"[Intro: 
Dr. Dre
]
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

They say pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturing pitiful punk niggas copping pleas
Puffing weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin'
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evading the playa hating tricks while hitting switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, ‘cause brawling motherfuckers is bold
But charge them hoes; the game should be sold
I'm sick of psychotic society, somebody save me
Addicted to drama, so even Mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffing weed with my peeps
I'm duckin' the cops, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin' my Glock
Niggas is hot when I hit the block; what if I die tonight?
[Chorus: 2Pac & 
Dr. Dre
]
If I die tonight
If I die tonight
Fuck it, if I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Polish your pistols, prepare for battle, pass the pump
When I get to poppin', niggas is droppin' then they done
Calling the coroner, come collect the fucking corpse
He got hit by a killer, preoccupied with being boss
Revenge is the method
Whenever steppin', keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggas and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets, making crack sales
Picture perfection, pursuing paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Running with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me, my pistol posse's using deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seeing cemetery photos of my peers
Conversating like they still here; if I die tonight
[Chorus: 2Pac & 
Dr. Dre
]
If I die tonight
Scare to die nigga, is ya, ha?
If I die tonight
Never fear, never worry
If I die tonight
Tonight's the night I get in some shit

Pussy and paper is poetry, power and pistols
Plotting on murdering motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the Heaven's, 
.357'
s to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for thug livin' when I die
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto for thug niggas
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissing while practicing how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick while drinking liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin' these 
simps
, for being petrified and lame
Disrespecting the game, praying for punishment and pain
Going insane, never die, I live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me, nigga, I ain't happy here
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines reading 'Murdered to death', my last breath
Take a look, picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand; if I die tonight
[Chorus: 2Pac & 
Dr. Dre

Nigga, if I die tonight
No fear nigga, never worry
If I die tonight
Bury me a motherfucking G, closed casket fuck it
If I die tonight

Intro,Me Against the World,1995,"At 12:25 AM Wednesday, 2Pac was on his way into a time square building to record at an eight-floor studio with another rapper. But in the lobby, Shakur was shot several times, including two graze wounds to the head. 2Pac's lawyers said the attack appeared to be a setup

Against doctors orders, 2Pac Shakur checked himself out of the hospital less than 24 hours after being shot 5 times on the way into a Manhattan recording studio

2Pac Shakur secures one clean legal victory this year, as he's dismissed of assault charges brought against him when he allegedly shot at two off-duty Atlantic cops on Halloween last year. The case was dismissed due to insufficient evidence

More controvery surrounding 2Pac Shakur ...

Meanwhile, in 2Pac news, at about 6:45 tonight, Shakur may have lowered his own chances of surviving the attack by checking himself out of the hospital that probably saved his life

2Pac Shakur checked into the Metropolitan Hospital yesterday under an assumed name. His lawyers said that he had connections, but wouldn't say what kind, that could provide top notch security for the injured rap star

Shakur underwent surgery today ...

The shooting of 2Pac Shakur here in New York City once again underscores the violence that has surrounded this man since he shot to superstardom in the world of music and entertainment",https://genius.com/2pac-intro-lyrics
It Ain’t Easy,Me Against the World,1995,"Keepin' it real

I take a shot of Hennessy
Now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of cess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggas on the other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change?
And what remains from a 12-gauge to the brain?
Arguments with my boo, it's true
I spend more time with my niggas than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang
That's the game, I'll be damned if a thang changed
Fuck the fame, I'll be hustlin' to make a million
Lord knows ain't no love for us ghetto children
So we cold, Rag-top slowin' down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass
Uh, it ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin' Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama got a mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin' like I'm hopeless
I can't cope, me and the homies smokin' roaches
'Cause we broke, late night, hangin' out 'til the sunrise
Gettin' high, watchin' the cops roll by
It ain't easy; that's right, it ain't easy

—easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary or will I stay free?

I can't sleep, niggas plottin' on me, kill me while I'm dreamin'
Wake up sweaty and screamin'
'Cause I can hear them suckers schemin'
Probably paranoid, problem is them punks be fantasizin'
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why, it's just the way it is, even now
Lookin' out for these killa kids 'cause they wild
Bill Clinton, can you recognize a nigga representin'
Doin' twenty to life in San Quentin?
Gettin' calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nothin' nice
Yo 'Pac, do somethin' righteous with your life
And even though you're innocent you still a nigga
So they figure, rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'ma hold you down and holla Thug Life
Lickin' shots 'til I see my niggas free on the block
But no, it ain't easy, ha ha ha
'Til I see my niggas free on the block, uh, it ain't easy

It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary—

Lately been reminiscin' about Peppermint Schnapps
In Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while d-boys slang rocks
Just a project kid without a conscience
I'm havin' dreams of hearin' screams at my concerts
Me and all my childhood peers
Through the years tryin' to stack a little green
I was only seventeen when I started servin' fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dolla
Sold my Impala 'cause these hard times make me wanna holla
Will I live to see tomorrow? Am I fallin' off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say: ""Fuck all of y'all!""
Ain't nobody down with me, I'm thuggin'
I can't go home, 'cause muh'fuckers think I'm buggin'
So now I'm in this high-powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail
What do I do in these county blues?
Gettin' battered and bruised by the you-know-who
And these fakes get to shakin' when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin' in this livin' hell, listenin' to niggas yell
Tryin' to torture 'em to tell, I'm gettin' mail
But ain't nobody sayin' much, the same old nuts
Is makin' bucks while these sluts is gettin' fucked
They violated my probation
And it seems I'll be goin' on a long vacation
Meanwhile, it ain't easy—
No, it ain't easy

It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?
It ain't easy being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free?

I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they should've killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin' crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
And if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm losin' hope, they got me stressin',
 
can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennessey got me queasy
Don't wanna hurl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam
, and it seems
Don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block

In the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breathe
Got me thinking, what do Hell got?

I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
And he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin' up
I'm gettin' lost in the weed, man, gettin' high
Livin' every day, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out

Me Against the World,Me Against the World,1995,"It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is out for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby

Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world

Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it",https://genius.com/2pac-me-against-the-world-lyrics
Old School,Me Against the World,1995,"Here we go; we gonna send this one out to the old school
All these motherfuckers in the Bronx, and Brooklyn, and Staten Island
Queens, and all the motherfuckers that laid it down, the foundation
Ya know what I'm saying? Nothing but love for the old school
That's who were going do this one for, ya feel me?

""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""
""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""

I remember Mr. Magic, Flash, Grandmaster Caz
LL, Raising Hell, but, that didn't last
Eric B. & Rakim was, the shit to me
I flip to see a Doug E. Fresh show, with Ricky D
And Red Alert was puttin in work, with Chuck Chill
Had my homies on the hill getting ill, when shit was real
Went out to steal
Remember Raw, with Daddy Kane?!
When De La Soul was puttin Potholes in the game
I can't explain how it was, Whodini
Had me puffin on that buddha gettin buzzed, 'cause there I was
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin on that Private Stock
Through my speaker Queen Latifah, and MC Lyte
Listen to Treach, KRS to get me through the night
With T La Rock and Mantronix, to Stetsasonic
Remember ""Push It"" was the bomb shit, nuttin like the old school

""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""

I had, Shell Toes, and BVD's
A killer crease inside my Lee's when I hit the streets
I'm playing skelly, Ringolevio, or catch a kiss
Before the homies in my hood learned to smack a bitch
I remember. way back, the weak weed they had
Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestyling
With some wild kids from Bucktown, profiling
'Cause the hoochies was starin, thinking ""what them niggas wearing?""
I'm wondering if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, humpin hoochies on the wall
Or taking leaks on the steps, stinking up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Rikers Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sipping 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school

""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""

Remember popping and locking to Kurtis Blow, the name belts
And Scott LaRock the Super Ho back in Latin Quarters
When Slick Rick was spittin La Di Da Di
Gaming the hoochies at the neighborhood block parties
I remember, breakdancing to Melle Mel
Jekyll and Hyde, LL when he Rocks the Bells
Forget the TV, I'd rather hit the streets and do graffiti
Be careful don't let the transit cops see me
It ain't nothing like the old school!

""What more could I say? I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way""

Haha, on the real though
Remember seeing Brooklyn go crazy up in the motherfucking party?
Remember motherfuckers used to go, ""Is Brooklyn in the house?""
And motherfuckers would lose they God Damn Mind!
That's the old school to me; that's what I'm sayin (Super, Sperm)
I remember goin places that motherfuckers was scared to say
They was from anywhere but Brooklyn; that shit was the bomb
Back in the motherfucking old school nigga
Remember 
skelly nigga?
 Knocking niggas out the box, popping boxes?
Remember stickball? Member niggas to run that shit like that?
Remember the block-- 'Member screaming up at your moms from the window?
(LL Cool J is hard as Hell...)
The ice cream truck, remember all the mother--
'Member the Italian Ices, yo? Yo, remember the Italian Ices?!
The Spanish Niggas comin' down with the coconut ices and shit?
I came through the door, said it before
That was the shit!",https://genius.com/2pac-old-school-lyrics
Outlaw,Me Against the World,1995,"That's right nigga you gotta get your papers in this motherfucker
I ain't mad at ya at all (damn)
Aiyyo, what the fuck you wanna be when you grow up RahRah?
Nigga, is you stupid, I wanna be a motherfuckin' Outlaw
That's right nigga, 
hahaha
.. housin' these hoes, you feel me?
Aight, you know what I'm sayin'?
You got to do that shit, keepin' it real nigga or what?
Keepin' it real!
How old are you nigga?
I'm eleven

Cause all I see is, murder murder, my mind state
Preoccupied with homicide, tryna survive through this crime rate
Dead bodies at block parties, those unlucky bastards
Gunfire now they require many closed caskets
Who can you blame? It's insane what we been through
Witnessin' evil that these men do, bitches sin too
In fact they be the reasons niggas get to bleedin'
Pull 'n' fuckin' fire when I leave 'em, you shoulda seen 'em
Hostile hoes catch elbows (beotch!) negroes disposed of
And snitches get dealt with, with no love
Body bags of adversaries that I had to bury
I broke the law and they jaw, all in the same flurry
But never worry, they'll remember me through history
Causin' motherfuckers to bleed, they'll label me a

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

Before I close my eyes I fantasize I'm livin' well
When I awake and realize I'm just a prisoner in hell
Just as well, cause in my cell I'm keepin' pictures of these bastards
Exercisin', visualizin', everyone inside a casket
Picture me blasted, surrounded by niggas in masks
Sent with the task to harass and murder my ass
Will I last? Heaven or Hell? Freedom or jail?
Shit's hard, who can you tell? And if we fail?
High speeds, and Thai weed on the freeway
When will they learn to take it easy? Uh
Drive-by's and niggas die, murder without a motive
By makin' motherfuckers fry
Got me runnin' from these coward-ass crooked-ass cops
Helicopters tryna hover over niggas 'til we drop
Got no time for the court, my only thought is open fire
Hit the district attorney, but fuck that bitch, cause she's a liar
Now it's time to expire, I see the judge, spray the bitch
""Motherfuckers is crooked,"" is what I scream, and hit the fence
I commence to get wicked, spittin' rounds as the plot thickens
Never missin', an early grave is my only mission
If I die, never worry, bury me beside my four-five
May God forgive me, I was high, label me a

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)


Society lied to me, I ain't never gonna try to be
My mob'll be doin' robberies, and stickups on these wannabe's
I witnessed niggas lose they chest
For ordinary reasons niggas bodies put to rest

So I just ... swallow my Beck's and holla, ""Fuck 'em!""
And if I'm next ... just let a nigga step with somethin'
I ain't fearin' nuttin'

Young and thuggin', prepared for bustin' if that's my destiny
Ready for whatever, see you niggas can't get the best of me
(hold me down) Definitely no need for askin'
(now he mashin') Top speed (smokin' weed) laughin' (biotch!)

Cause when I bust 'em they gonna shiver, the killers cry
Soldiers got bodies floatin' in the river, what is they sayin'?
Talkin' 'bout prayin'

They need to stop, that ain't gon' help
These niggas sprayin' up my block

Tryin' to take my wealth

Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (They came in to sin)
Outlaw, Outlaw, Outlaw (Dear God, I wonder could you save me?)

Fuck the judge, I gotta grudge
Punk police, niggas run the streets
Hahah, it ain't nuttin' but muuuusic
Shit's changed
1995 the game has changed, motherfuckers is actin REAL strange
The rules is all rearranged
You got babies lyin' dead in the streets
These punk police is crooked as me
But all I see is motherfuckers actin less than G's
Stop bein' a playa-hater, be a innovator nigga
Fuck that shit, don't be no entertainer and a stranger
Be a real motherfucker keep it real pack that steel
Cause you know these streets is real ill
Muh'fuckers wanna see me in my casket
Jealous, motherfuckin' bastards
I never die, thug niggas multiply
Cause after me is Thug Life baby
Then the young thugs
Then the youngest thug of all, my nigga RahRah!",https://genius.com/2pac-outlaw-lyrics
So Many Tears,Me Against the World,1995,"I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, shed so many tears

Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come

Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

And Lord knows I tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears

Lord, lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered many years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears",https://genius.com/2pac-so-many-tears-lyrics
Temptations,Me Against the World,1995,"Heyyyy! Heyy-ayyaahhyy

Yo, Mo Bee, mayn, drop that shit!
You know what time
Boo-yaow! I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand, you know what I'm sayin'?
And uh, throw up that finger!
Hey yo, throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style, baby, thug style, y'know?

Tell me, baby, are you lonely? Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if you're only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong, love, tell me, 'cause I get caught up
In the life I live, it's hell, see, I never thought
I'd see the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard?
I've been known to clown and get around, that's my word
See you walkin' and you lookin' good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin' me
With your attitude to match, right? Don't be phony
Cause I hate it when you act like, you don't know me
I've been stressin' in the spotlight, I want the fame
But the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be with you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
Look here, I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go—

Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go
Throw them the finger!
You know what, baby, it's like—

I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

Will I cheat or will I be committed? Heaven knows
Gettin' weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
In my ride and I'm all in, gettin' high
I can hear the people callin', I'm passin' by
Everybody knows I'm ballin', and to God
Gotta keep myself from fallin', but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do?
Gettin' shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while? You decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
In your ears as I kiss ya on every curve
Slow down baby, don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates to your waterfall up in heaven
And don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was—

Give 'em the finger!
All my homies go, throw your fingers up!
That's just the thug in me, girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like—

I know you've been searchin' for someone
To make you happy and get the job done
You say you needed a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care?

A lot of people think it's easy to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
Got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
Sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
'Cause even thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin' up the telephone, reminiscin'
I wanna take you to the movies and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin' you right
You're lonely and depressed, you need a thug in your life
Enough talkin', you want me to leave I'll get to walkin'
See you later, 'cause baby, I'm a player, and all I heard was—

Give 'em the finger, and all my homies go
Yo, this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey, y'know?
Throw your fingers up!
You know? They gonna peep this
This how we run game on you
All my niggas go, uptown in the, give 'em the finger!
Throw your hands up, give 'em the finger!",https://genius.com/2pac-temptations-lyrics
Young Niggaz,Me Against the World,1995,"I wanna dedicate this one to Robert ""Yummy"" Sandifer
And all other lil' Young Niggas that's in a rush to be gangstas

As a Young nigga, I'm almost runnin' in the wind
Give anything, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin' with the homies
'Til them niggas started slangin', now they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin' to make a million, can you blame me?
With that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
Someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin'
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin' with a twenty sack of indo, feelin' good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, though it's bad
But all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
As young niggas

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
(As a young nigga)
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
(My memories as a young nigga)
Always got it blown like Al Capone
(Strung nigga)
He's the downest G I've ever known

Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin' by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin' high
My neighborhood was full of drive-bys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin' short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
Let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
Me against the world stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitches 'cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play
But that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga

He's the kind of G that everybody knows
(As a young nigga)
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
(My memories as a young nigga)
Always got it blown like Al Capone
(young nigga)
He's the downest G I've ever known

I'm tellin' you—to be young, have your brains and have every limb and all that—yo, y'all niggas don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
And peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you begin your life
You dumb nigga

Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein' somethin'
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin' nuttin
Tryin' to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
And I will even if it kills me, my Young Niggas
Break away from these dumb niggas
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come figure
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin'
Puttin' niggas in a casket, murdered for hangin'
At the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin'
'Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
The epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin' hopeless, where
More and more brothers givin' up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
And I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggas

He's the kind of G like everybody knows
(for the young niggas)
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
(My memories as a young nigga)
Always got it blown like Al Capone
(this for nigga.., this for the young nigga)
He's the downest G I've ever known
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known

This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)
Them niggas that's thirteen and fourteen
Drivin' Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy)
Young motherfuckin' hustlers (make that money boy)
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin' accountant, not a dope dealer
You know what I'm sayin'? (Go to school nigga, go to school)
Fuck around and, you pimpin' out here
You could be a lawyer (really doe)
Niggas gotta get they priorities straight

Runnin’ (From Tha Police),Niggas Ain’t Ready,1995," 
One time, one time, nigga, one time! (Where?)
Runnin' from the police (Yeah, I know what you mean)
No matter what I do, they got a nigga
Still runnin' from the police
(Put them motherfucking Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all)


I ain't got nuttin' on my mind, but gettin' in some trouble
Licking shots to they block, leavin' bloody blood puddles
For some ridah's delight
, now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight
It's on me, but 
if I die, bury me a motherfucking G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker, got me runnin' from the police

Nigga, you know that's true
Catch a nigga like 
K-Dog
, chillin' with a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all okay
To that fuckin' fake cop, got to play the man
Ran me down the block with my glass in my hand
Damn, I hope it don't spill
Nigga chill, shit is real, cock back my steel

Still runnin' from the police, I gets no sleep
I got you peepin' in my window, while I'm smokin' indo
But I ain't no motherfucking track star, pigs got a jeep
Like 
Big Malcolm
, runnin' through motherfucker's backyards
So I grabs my piece before I flee
And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me
Lick shots hit spots off on my piece
'Cause a nigga like Big Malcolm is through runnin' from the police

Now it's war, me trying to sell, runnin' from the punk po-lice
They try to cock me, but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me north
Pulled up the park, I left school and let's buck
Look around, look around, punk po-lice
Run as fast as you can, but you can't catch me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me have to blast back, 'cause they blast at me


Yo I was, schemin' and fiendin' for loots and took the crooked route to
Ghetto fame I felt the pains and now I run the game
The insane brain, cold gettin' fly like a plane
On them suckers with my nigga Biggie Smalls causin' ruckus

Check it, 
I grew up, a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' to turn into the black Frank White

And we got the workers choppin' rock
, fiends by the flock
And we gettin' it, the dirty cop is jealous so they sweatin' it
I'm lettin' off smoke, hope they don't play me for no joke
And provoke the homicide, so just let the drama slide
We keepin' it real, fuck how you feel, Biggie pass the steel
Let's serve these motherfuckers, slugs as a fuckin' meal

We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga, I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Now it's war, me trying to sell, runnin' from the punk po-lice
They try to cock me, but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me north
Pulled up the park, I left school and let's buck
Look around, look around, punk po-lice
Run as fast as you can, but you can't catch me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me have to blast back, 'cause they blast at me

They got me runnin' from the five-o
Duckin' and dodgin' and my survival
Depends on when I let off with my nine, ho
I'm movin' swifter than the next nigga, no time for sex
'Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homie slipped and now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen, now he's doin' triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin'
I spit that thug shit
Nigga, motherfuck singin'
I hope you got your Timberlands on tight
'Cause I ain't givin' up
I'd rather duck these motherfuckers all night
I'm runnin' through the projects, biatch
They'll never catch me
'Cause I'm loc'ed and trigger happy on the, sniatch
Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me
I'm a legend
Do thug niggas go to heaven?
I'm rollin' with the Thoro Headz
We gettin' ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-o
I'm runnin' from the police

Now it's war, me trying to sell, runnin' from the punk po-lice
They try to cock me, but them can't gun store
What about they come to hold up me north
Pulled up the park, I left school and let's buck
Look around, look around, punk po-lice
Run as fast as you can, but you can't catch me
Look around, look around, punk police
Me have to blast back, 'cause they blast at me",https://genius.com/2pac-runnin-from-tha-police-lyrics

Jealous, 'cause they peepin' me on TV
Mad, 'cause they bitches wanna G me
Now take it easy, it ain't my fault to see a hooker
You should've shook her, don't playahate me when I took her
Life of a crook, look at them thug niggas ballin' y'all
I got ya hoochies full of liquor, fuckin' all of y'all
And my, name! Will be synonymous with spittin' game
Slangin' 'caine, it ain't the same, niggas better change
Them three-strikes will have ya stretched fo' life
To get arrested twice, the third time fo' life
And I, don't think you understand me G
That penitentiary time just ain't the plan for me
I got a new thang wit' ya papers and do thangs
Niggas ain't followin' ya true game

Everywhere we hang it's the same thang
In '95 you can die if ya gang bang
You could survive, gettin' high like a true G
Can't close my eyes 'cause these cowards wanna do me
And sue me
 I've been hustlin' since day one
Out on the block and never stop until my pay come
But nowadays It's like bang, bang, duck quick
I guess you dookies tough shit, 'cause you bust clips
But suck dick, 'cause a kid got his cap peeled
The rap deal full of phonies who pack steel
And act ill, everybody wanna act hard
I swear to god, It's the season to pull a nigga card
You fuckin' frauds, can't handle business like a soldier
Bet you petrified to throw it from the shoulders

I had a beef in every city, screamin' fuck the police
Couldn't sleep, I'm havin' thoughts 'bout the baddest bitches
Picture me mobbin' in a rag with switches
Fuck snitch, I let a trick be a trick
When he sippin' leave 'em sleepin' in the middle of the streets while I'm pimpin'
You can throw a sign, but I'm blind to that punk shit
Runnin' with some real motherfuckers and we run shit
Fuck the dumb shit, I ain't stoppin' it's a high speed
Rollin' on the 405, puffin' Thai weed
I'm shiftin' gears, then I disappear
Listen here, If they take me alive I'm doin' years, but still no fear 'Cause I don't think that they can catch me
This 350 will put the bitches right in back of me
They won't jack me
And just when I thought I passed
Fucked around and went low on gas
All I heard was ""Throw ya hands up""

My Block,The Show (Original Soundtrack) ,1995,"They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscin' on my past fears
'Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath, the underlying cause of my arrest
My life is stressed, and no rest forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit's scary, our black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm gettin' worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen' ain't for me, 'cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin' on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
'Cause all the little babies goin crazy and they sufferin' in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop 'cause it don't stop... on my block


Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male living in hell when will we prevail
Fearin' jail but crack sales got me livin' well
In a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin' strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, 'cause I'm starvin', can't get a job
So I resort to violent robbings, my life is hard
Can't sleep 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Misled from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit, the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block


And I can't help but wonder why
So many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
'Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin' black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin' out pickin' up game, sippin' cheap liquor
Gamin' the hoochies hopin' I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin' strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin' phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin' focus... on my block


And block parties in the projects lastin' way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen'
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin'
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, misses call
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin' to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is that everybody knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin' pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game... from my block

Muh fucka can't lie, tho
Outta all them...
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers who passed away
From all the blocks that I’m from
One-twelve street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin'?
183rd and Walt, my block, that’s right
122nd and Morningside, my block, that’s right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that’s right
In the jungle of Marin City, that’s my block, that’s right
Los Angeles, haha, that’s my block too
Oakland, can’t forget Oaktown, that’s my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago
All y'all niggas stay kicking up dust",https://genius.com/2pac-my-block-lyrics

On a mission to be champs since they let me free

trapped in a livin' hell
Though not guilty I'm still in jail

A lethal weapon mind sharp

To shake the world with the flurry of my black fist

I had to
Why'd you pack the straps
'Cause I had to
Why'd you jack the scratch
'Cause I had to
Say what, say what
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent
'Pac
You certified crazy

I got to work with what you gave me
Claiming' I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this Holocaust headed for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
What's a nigga got to do to get respected?
Sometimes I think I'm gettin' tested
And if I don't say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are gettin' restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
And since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck, buck is the sound as I move up
Other niggas pay attention when I'm fool, bust
They make a nigga be a killer I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder If the Lord ever heard of me (uh)
I need loot so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues

Can't you see, we're raised to all be thugs
Make's us do the things we do
Got to let a Outlaw make moves
(A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent)
Why did you slang crack ('Cause I had to)
Why did you pack straps ('Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch ('Cause I had to)
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent

Poppa need brand new shoes
But what the fuck can a nigga do
My little boy got to eat too
So why must I sock-a-fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to drink
Cops want to hit me with the book
And you're hooked on my eye don't give a fuck look
Make your rules I'm a break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em
You show me bacon I'ma take 'em
So don't you ever tempt me
I'm a fool for mine nigga and my pockets stay empty
To my brothers In the barrio
You livin' worse than the niggas In the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
Got love, you got problems with the punk police
Don't run from the chumps get the pump from me
We ain't free I'll be damned if I played a trick
For a blonde hair blue-eyed Caucasian bitch (Bitch!)
Down with my homeboy Rich
Fuck a snitch and a groupie ass bitch
And the nigga with a cellular phone
Leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone (That ain't right)
And you wonder why we blazin' niggas
'Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas (What's up kid)
And they bound to be fuckups too
Drinkin' forties of brew singin' nigga blues
(Hey Pac, say what?)

Why did you slang crack ('Cause I had to)
Why did you pack straps ('Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch ('Cause I had to)
Come on, Come on Now I'm headin' for the mothafuckin' 'pen

I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
I'm a soldier
Westside Outlaw, Bad Boy killer

Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us
Livin the life of trife juveniles, hopin for righteous
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin to get us
ATF state feds scandalous bitches
I wasn't promised to it, wasn't bitter or sweet
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
Only streets livin do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions and felons in the rush for cheese
Please understand my history a man of many acts
Livin Thug Life, comin equipped, with many gats
Maybe I was just a Lost Soul, trapped in time
Livin in between life, and the cracks were blind
Even though we had hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain


My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with
A three-five when he get out would I be dead or alive
He taught me the rules so much, but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin trap shut
My Mom Dukes got a little bit of Thug in her
The Devil loves sinners crackheads and drug dealer
Sometimes I feel like the streets are takin over
Never stayin sober, the brain over and over backtrack
My stack's fat, I used to take new


I was born twenty-two years ago, yesterday
But see I saw no reason for me to celebrate, let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
To be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day

2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted,All Eyez on Me,1996,"[Intro: 2Pac & 
Snoop Doggy Dogg
]
Up out of there
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sure 'nough, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

So now they got us laced
Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Bimmer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now follow as we ride
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it
Another warrant, two of America's most wanted
[Chorus: Daz Dillinger & 
2Pac

Nothin' but a gangsta party

It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
(
Nothin' but a gangsta party
It ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' gangsta party
)
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, sufferin' is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee, these niggas must be crazy, what?
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can't fade the thugs
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like Cuzz, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids

They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga Dogg wit' me, eternally the most wanted

Ain’t Hard 2 Find,All Eyez on Me,1996,"[Intro/Chorus: C-Bo, D-Shot, Richie Rich, 
2Pac
 & E-40]
They say
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'
That's right, that's right boy, start that shit off

I heard a rumor I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage, you know mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin'
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Where I spend most of my time, my California grind
Watchin' for thievin', I'm cautious, it's like I'm barely breathin'
Puttin' a bullet in motherfuckers, give me da reason
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded
You tried to play me, now homicide's my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin', too scared to fight a G?
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin' life after a night of fuckin' around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme
Then bring your big bad ass to California, 'cause we ain't hard to find
[Chorus: C-Bo, D-Shot, Richie Rich,

Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'
Preoccupied with my chips
And niggas call me a timer
I been ballin' since my adolescent years steady climbin'
Motherfuckers don't know nuttin' about no timin'

I got my locs on, hard hat, goin' to war
Breakin' them off on sight, stoppin' lives like red lights
Watch 'em pause as I pull my strap out my draws
And get to dumpin' on they ass like the last outlaw
Rich, 2Pac and The Click, smokin' blunts, loadin' clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick

I'm fully automatic, full of static and shit
Movin' Dodge van, fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin' shotgun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckin' mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O
Where sellin' narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, and weed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker, I ain't hard to find

Some may call me bootsy, but I call it timin'
That's while I keeps on grindin' (that's right)
To the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin' this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a ho, a ho
Get in my way, then that ass gots to go
'Cause a nigga steady plottin'
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin'
[Chorus: C-Bo, D-Shot, Richie Rich, 
2Pac

Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin'

Down the steps
Abandoned broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal weapons they carry, can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is a proof without the trauma plate?
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for if you gon' hesitate?
Best shake and bake all them I-was-finst-to-ass niggas
Motherfuckers-didn't-think-I was-gon'-do-somethin'-ass niggas
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him, have at him

I grew up with that nigga
Threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin' to ride
Double agent for the other side
But now, my Glock be so judgmental
Back seat of a rental
Keep my name out your dental, nigga
If your gum bleedin' and you needin'
More than twenty stitches, you behave like them bitches
Sideways to the next
Heavy in the game

All About U,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Ah, yeah! Hahaha (Yeah)
It's all about you, one time (I'ma say it's all about you, baby, yeah)
Haha, for the bitches that think it's all about you (It's all about you) (This Dru Down in the house
With my boy 'Pizznac, you know what I'm sayin'?)
It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)

You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh 'bout how I got my ass
Caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it?
Addicted to the things you do
But still true what I'm sayin', boo, ‘cause this is all about you

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Yeah, nigga
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas ‘cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep low, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through
It's all about you
Yeah, nigga, it's all about you

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch-ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
(It's all about you)

Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
It's all about you
No matter where I go, I see the same ho
Every other city we go, every other video
No matter where I go, I see the same ho

I'm tellin' ya, it's the same old shit
I mean, goddamn, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sittin' back, watchin' Montell Jordan video
I see the same bitch who was in my homeboy Nate Dogg video
Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?
What make that even more fucked up
I'm watchin' a Million Man March
And I see the same bitch on the Million Man March
That was in the homeboy Warren G video!
I mean, damn, everywhere I look, everywhere I go
I see the same ho

All Eyez on Me,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Big Syke, Newt, Hank, Beauregard, Big Sur (yeah)
Y'all know how this shit go (you know)
All eyes on me
Motherfuckin' OG
Roll up in the club and shit, is that right?
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where them cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player, 'cause even when I'm high
Fuck with me and get crossed later, the futures in my eyes
'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings
Uhh, bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers die
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got four niggas in low riders and ski masks
Screamin', ""Thug Life"" every time they pass, all eyes on me

Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player (All eyes on me) 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high

Hey, to my nigga 'Pac

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' everyday, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me

Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me

Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, ""Bing!""
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body

They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope

Ambitionz Az a Ridah,All Eyez on Me,1996,"I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' Crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, 'cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and twist us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous
'Cause deep in the hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
(That's all you niggas got?)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find ya
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

Can’t C Me,All Eyez on Me,1996,"The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown

Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga what! It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

(""I don't know."")
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
(""Hell yeah."")
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room
(""Hey there, bitch, where Suge at, nigga?"")
Call Suge, call all the niggas tell 'em to meet me downstairs
(""Where K and them niggas at man?"")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around

Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup?

Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(""Fuck that, I lost some money, nigga."")
Aw nigga, damn

Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night, that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantasy, Alizé and Hennessy
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin' with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, 'til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter, just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems
, it's check out time

We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time!!
Gotta go nigga, gotta go
(""Y'all know what time it is!"")
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man, call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shit, cause we out this, motherfucker

They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's trump tight
So I find time to recline
Sneak in your room, instant massage, sip wines of all kinds
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night
I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out
Cause there's someone else who deserves my attention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time

We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

Aiyyo man 'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'?
Don't even want to leave
Yo man, it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
(You seem them bitches?)
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece! Yo nigga, whassup?

Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
My behavior is crazy from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin' in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin' your thoughts, cause I'm livin' fed, heard what I said?
Passion is crashin' the room
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin' out, you're yellin' out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight from 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close, you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time

We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!

Ay, it's check out time
Ay Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin', where my shoes go, nigga?
Where my motherfuckin' drawers and shit at man?
Man, y'all niggas was in here partyin' too fuckin' much
What the fuck y'all doin', nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz, man, and Bogart and the rest of them niggas
C'mon man, niggas is trippin' man
Front desk all callin' me, tellin' me to get the hell outta here, man
I ain't got no more money, somebody loan me a hundred

We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go, we gotta go!
We gotta go!!! oooo!!
We gotta, go!!!
We, heyyy!
We!!, we gotta go!.. haaa!!
We gotta, go!! haa!!",https://genius.com/2pac-check-out-time-lyrics
Got My Mind Made Up,All Eyez on Me,1996,"You find a MC like me who's strong
Leavin' motherfuckers aborted with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone
I get deadly as Khan, though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm all those
Who can withstand the more power I gain?
And make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck yo' brain
Imagine and keep on wishin' upon a star
Finally realizin' who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin', faded
Would it be the greatest MC of all-time? When I created rhyme
For the simple fact, when I attack I crush your pride
Our intention to ride, every time, all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
For me to put down my guard, I'm faced what I'ma ride
Breakin' in gas with the '68 all day
In-and-out with my pay, I'm soon to count the bodies

So mandatory my elevation, my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with the nigga you facin'
We must be patient, nothin' better than communication
Known to damage and highly flammable, like gas stations
Sorry, I left that ass waitin', no more procrastination
Give up to fate and get that ass shakin'
I'm bustin' and makin' motherfuckers panic
Don't take your life for granted
Put that ass in the dirt, you swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to ""Rhythm Nation"", but thugged out, forgive me, Janet
Who's in control? I'm activatin' your souls
You know the way the games gettin' told
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alizé and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin' rhyme I wrote
Takin' off my coat, clearin' my throat

I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night
I got my mind made up, come on
Get in, get into
Let it ride, tonight's the night

Well, I comes through with two packs of the bomb prophylacs
For protection, so my fuckin' sack won't collapse
'Cause nowadays, shit's evadin' the X-rays
Sendin' young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder if my terrifyin' tactics of torturin' MCs
Shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electrifyin' like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin' poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's the fuckin' Bombay
You got ten steps before instant death like Bai Mei
My rhymes'll leave a mark on your mind
As the deadly virus spread through your head like Sand Palm
There's no escape, nah, I ain't blastin'
I use my mental to assassinate assassins for those askin'
Opposed to laughin', raw maniacal villain
Laughter enhances the chances of the killin'
Why is that? 'Cause smilin' faces deceive
You best believe: to MCs, I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip your throat and make it hard to breathe
Your whole camp's under siege, and I'm Jason Voorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mics
My verbal snipe your vocabs on site
I'm out the cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split the bricks on the wall
You already have an idea about the superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of the Equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To L.A., on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat

Fuck you losers!
While you fake jacks, I makes maneuvers
Like Hitler stickin' up (Jews) with German (Lugers)
The mister Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this message, don't touch the dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket—blaow!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellan
Half of my clan's repeat felons
Niggas best protect they joints for nine-nickels
Man, I stay on point like icicles
Now, who wanna test Tical, the tes-ticals
All up in your motherfuckin' mouth
Headbanger boogie, catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man rolled too tight, you can't pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin' fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast

Ayo, lyrical gat spittin' the criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this mad underground basement shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on your whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor, who? Spock, bitch, don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
To get the fresh package of bless the dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from the rear block
To bust 'til every nigga here drop, men, I fear not
Hold your nose and blow out 'til your ears pop
Since your crew suit you to shift
Now, you claim that your gears locked
Whiff this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the Bomb Analyst
Flip MCs like ki's
My degrees freeze consecutively, like EPMD LPs
Lick off a shot and hit your fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case Jake wanna snake
Bust it, I'm the one pushin' the hearse, in the first place
Confidence for you shaky-ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
Choke off this antidote, got you ope
Get roast by my lyrical Billy Dee .45 Colt
(And I'm out for nine-nickel)

Heartz of Men,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Hey, Suge, what I tell you, nigga?
When I come out of jail, what I was gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right?
Heh, watch this!
Hey, Quik, let me see them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars!
Hahahahaha! Yeah, nigga, time to ride!
Grab your bulletproof vest, nigga
'Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now, me and Quik finna show you niggas
What it's like on this side—the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now, the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now, everybody keep your eyes on the prize
'Cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side
That say they're your friends, but, in real life, they your enemies
And then you got some motherfuckers that say they your enemies
But in real life, they eyes is on your money
See, the enemies will say they true
But in real life, those niggas will be snitches
It's a dirty game, y'all
Y'all gotta be careful about who you fuck with
And who you don't fuck with, 'cause the shit get wild, y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, baby
Keep your mind on your riches

9-1-1, it's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, every one of you niggas heard of me
Shit, I'm legendary, niggas scaried and paralyzed
Nothin' more I despise than a liar, cowards die
My mama told me when I was a seed
Just a vicious motherfucker, why these devils left me free?
I proceed to make 'em shiver when I deliver
Criminal lyrics from a worldwide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere, Mr. Makaveli
Niggas is waitin' for some thug shit, that's what they tell me
So many rumors, but I'm infinite, Immortal Outlaw
Switchin' up on you ordinary bitches like a southpaw: you get left
And every breath I breathe until the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a G
I rip the crowd, then I start again, eternally, I live in sin
Until the moment that they let me breathe again
The hearts of men

The hearts of men

My lyrical verge with so much pain, to some niggas, it hurts
My guns bust, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw, and five-o
Get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fuckin' fight so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a G to this until the day I'm gone, that's regardless
Ride by, niggas bow down, thought I'd rot in jail
Paid bail, well, a nigga's out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up, first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villain if you let me
A motherfucker if you do upset me
Tell the cops to come and get me
Rip the crowd like a phone number, then start again
Don't have no motherfuckin' friends
Nigga, look inside the hearts of men

In the hearts of men

To all my niggas engaged in makin' money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer livin' in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced that this is my year like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is havin' problems, open fire and bomb
I died and came back, I hustle with these lyrics
As if it's a game of crack, thuggin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowin'
Scarred up but still flowin', energized and still goin'
Uhh, can it be fate, that makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous-ass cowards 'cause they evil and fake?
What will it take? Give me that bass line, I'm feelin' bomb
Death Row, baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent, 'cause I've been sent, the hearts of men",https://genius.com/2pac-heartz-of-men-lyrics
Heaven Ain’t Hard 2 Find,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Heaven ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is look

Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
I can see it clearly now
Catch you smilin' through your frown
I'm askin' baby boo are you down
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, Mr. I-get-around
My temptation got me drippin' wet, perspiration
I'm activated by the moves you're makin'
Baby why you fakin'? Strip naked get to love makin'
See it's all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize 'til that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Stop with the beeper, baby, listen
I know you're grown but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tongue kissin'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find

Hea-ven!!
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find

Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believin' in magic
It takes a lot of sacrifice
With all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes
Baby, you're movin' to fast
My conversations are gettin' deeper, but first let me ask
Are you afraid of a thug?
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
This thug passion help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Alizé, come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
And I know it takes some time and you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven ain't hard to find

Hea-ven!!
Heaven ain't hard to find
Hea-ven!!, it ain't hard to find

You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact I wink and you respond back
Lookin' mean, what's all that?
It's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
I'm sippin' Hennessy and Coke
Though addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh God, help me, identify me truest thoughts
Your hidden motives full of passion
Who would have thought?
Come holler at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends, I can soup you in my Benz
We'll ride, I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin
Until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

Hea-ven!!, Hea-ven, it ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find nice glass of Alize
Hea-ven!!!, Hea-ven!!! Hea-ven, Heaven
Hea-ven!!! it ain't hard to find

Holla at Me,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Niggas out there jealous 'cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us though
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
With that funky sound (so funky)
We be throwin' down

This goes out to you, playa
You know, you know who you are

Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me

Are you confused?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes
Of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose?
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
How could you do me like that? I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
Without your word, you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for you, nigga, we can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do? If it was up to you, I'd be dead now
I let the world know, nigga, you a coward
You could never be live until you die
See the motherfuckin' bitch in your eye
Type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)

Gotta be ready, can’t let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

Curious, spittin' lyrics on the verge of furious
I'm addicted to currency, nigga, that's why we doin' this
I got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
No hesitation, this information got you contemplatin'
Heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
Break him and let him see the face of a mental patient
It's a celebration of my criminal elevation, more participation
I want members across the fifty states
We keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
Will I be great, is it my fate to live the life of luxury?
Some niggas bought my tapes, so much jealousy it scares me
So be prepared, 'cause only the strong survive, life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see, come fuck with me, I give that ass a try
Nigga, holla at me

Gotta be careful, can’t let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
And now I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

I should've saw the signs, I was blinded
Criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain
Why she blame me?
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision that got me livin'
Just like an animal, I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' 'cause hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
Picture my prophecy, I got some attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers, but never let 'em stop me
'Cause I'm a soldier, hell, ever since I was a little nigga
Havin' fantasies of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid, trust; a no-no
Love is a mystery, fuck the po-po
Holla at me

So when you see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
A nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay

How Do U Want It,All Eyez on Me,1996,"How do you want it?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it yeah?
How do you feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

I love the way you activate your hips and push your ass out
Got a nigga wantin' it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby, just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh shit, you got me fiendin'
Body talkin' shit to me, but I can't comprehend the meanin'
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doin' eighty on the freeway, police, catch me if you can
Forgive me, I'm a rider, still I'm just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame, I'm a simple man
Mr. International, player with the passport
Just like Aladdin, bitch, get you anything you ask for
It's either him or me; Champagne, Hennessy
A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies
Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what a ho need
Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need
Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day
But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way
Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it
Time to give it to daddy, nigga, now tell me how you want it

Tell me is it cool to fuck?
Did you think I come to talk? Am I a fool or what?
Positions on the floor, it's like erotic
Ironic, 'cause I'm somewhat psychotic
I'm hittin' switches on bitches
Like I been fixed with hydraulics
Up and down like a roller coaster
I'm up inside ya, I ain't quittin' 'til the show is over
'Cause I'm a rider, in and out just like a robbery
I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me
Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alizé
A livin' legend you ain't heard about
These niggas play these Cali days
C. Delores Tucker, you's a motherfucker
Instead of tryin' to help a nigga, you destroy a brother
Worse than the others; Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole
You're too old to understand the way the game's told
You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot facts
Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, nigga, top that
They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in a cell
Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell
Now everybody talkin' about us, I could give a fuck
I'd be the first one to bomb and cuss
Nigga, tell me how you want it

How do you want it?
How do you  feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real
How do you want it?
How do you  feel?
Comin' up as a nigga in the cash game
Livin' in the fast lane, I'm for real

Raised as a youth, tell the truth
I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof
Lickin' shots off from the roof
Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager
Game rules, I'm livin' major
My adversaries is lookin' worried
They paranoid of gettin' buried
One of us gon' see the cemetery
My only hope to survive if I wish to stay alive
Gettin' high, see the demons in my eyes, before I die
I wanna live my life and ball, make a couple million
And then I'm chillin', fade 'em all
These taxes got me crossed up and people tryin' to sue me
Media is in my business and they actin' like they know me
But I'ma mash out and peel out
I’m with a clique that’s quick to whip that fuckin' steel out
Yeah nigga, it's some new shit so better get up on it
When you see me, tell a nigga how you want it

I Ain’t Mad At Cha,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri Curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy & 
2Pac
]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause Mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy & 
2Pac
]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy & 
2Pac
]
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
And I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha",https://genius.com/2pac-i-aint-mad-at-cha-lyrics
Life Goes On,All Eyez on Me,1996,"How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, 'cause life goes on

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man, don't front

No More Pain,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Hey, DeVante
Nigga, don't you know we're gonna sow up
Every bitch in the country?
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin' room, on the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right, nigga
Hey, drop that shit, boy

My adversaries cry like ho's
Fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin' you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son? Fuck the phony niggas, I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come
Now fire when ready, stay watchin' our figure
Increase speed, make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth
 quicker
Plus all these niggas that you run with be on some dumb shit
Trickin' on hoes, I ain't the one, bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick
Have every single bitch that came witchu on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin' you stupid bitches, this is telekinesis
Am I reachin' your brain? Nigga, how can I explain?
How vicious this thug motherfucker came
When I die, I want to be a living legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin' game, with no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)

Line up my adversaries, blast on sight
And fuck your boyfriend, bitch, I want some ass tonight
You know my steelo
Alizé and Cristal, weed
Sure you heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh?
Plus all you busters is jealous
Pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggas to open fire
I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin'
My Glock's spittin' rounds, niggas fallin' down, clutchin' they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggas on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggas don't die
Can ya hear me? Laced with this game, I know you feel me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a soldier with a brain to teach your whole nation and feelin' no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (Yeah, nigga, no more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
(What? What, nigga?)
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (No more pain)
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain (No pain, nigga)
Let's go inside my astral plane (No pain)

Bury me that's what they all say
It's time to make a killin', sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch, I know you want me, what your mouth say?
Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips
No time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggas from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin', it ain't nothin' we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker 
'cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptized the public
Now you all thugs, nigga, don't you love it?
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin' so watch the guns bust
You niggas will bleed, fuckin' with me, you'll be deceased
Never restin' in peace, nigga, with no more pain

I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane
I came to bring the pain, hardcore from the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane

Hahahahaha, yeah, nigga, yeah! Hahahaha, no more pain
It's just like that, nigga, like that, yeah, no more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches, no more pain
Feel me, nigga? Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me? No more pain
Fully automatic type shit, no more pain
Coward-ass niggas, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol, nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes, nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain
Say Thuuuuuuuug Life, baby

Prison ain't changed me, nigga, it made me worse
Feel me, nigga, hahaha, no more pain
Hey, DeVante, I'm givin' these motherfuckers choices
Niggas can roll with us, or they can be rolled up under us

Only God Can Judge Me,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Only God can judge me (that right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me


I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise

Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me now
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me

Only God man
That right?
That’s real
Hahahahahaha
Fuck everybody else, you know what I’m sayin'?
Man, look here, man
My only fear of death
Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man
That’s for the homie mental

Picture Me Rollin’,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Yeah, clear enough for ya? (alright)
Why niggas look mad?
Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free
Y'all niggas look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail
Ho bustas!

Picture me rollin' in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggas, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance
That's what somebody be tellin'
Know there's dope bein' sold, but I ain't the one sellin'
Don't want to be another number
I gotta puff a gang of weed to keep from goin' under
The federales wanna see me dead
Niggas put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottweilers by my bed, I feed 'em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?
Will God forgive me for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
When niggas shootin' at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin', the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just schemin' on ways
To put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin'
Flossin' a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin'
And my hands are swollen
Thinkin' of the G's I'll be holdin'; picture me rollin'

Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Ooh wee

Can you see me now?
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a clear picture
Can you see it?
Picture me rollin'
Yeah, nigga!
Aye, but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?

I got keys comin' from overseas
Cost a nigga 200 G's
I'm a street commando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss 'cause I'm more like a boss player
Thug, branded to be a women-layer
So many player haters, imitators steady swangin'
Make me wanna start back bangin'
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin' 40 Glocks, contain 'em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin' from my enemies
While I'm sippin' on Rémy
In front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
'96 big body, sittin' on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin' is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin' a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin'
It's hard to imagine, picture me rollin'

Picture me rollin'
Picture, picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'
Picture me

I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
'Cause a nigga straight sufferin' from lack of havin' paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some ballin'-ass niggas, and they slippin' in my spot
And, uh, diggin' the plots (so what?)
Checkin' in the park, 'Pac

We caught him sleepin'
He didn't peep you niggas creepin'?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit
CPO, you got the bomb spot
Nigga, time to clock it
I get the liquor, and you can get the females
This crooked shit that we inflictin', gettin' street sales

Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my 9
I'm cool as a motherfucker, I'ma get mine
Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swoll
Boss Hogg and this 'Pac nigga, picture us rollin'

Picture me rollin'
Picture me
Picture me rollin'
Picture me rollin'

Is y'all ready for me?
Picture me rollin' roll call
You know there's some muh'fuckers out there
I just could not forget about
I wanna make sure they can see me
Number one on my list: Clinton Correctional Facilities
All you bitch-ass CO's
Can you niggas see me from there?
Ballin' on y'all punk-ass!
Picture me rollin', baby!
Yeah, all them niggas up in them cell blocks
I told y'all niggas when I come home it's on
That's right, nigga, picture me rollin'
Oh, I forgot! The DA
Yeah, that bitch had a lot to talk about in court
Can the ho see me from here?
Can you see me, ho? Picture me rollin'
And all you punk police, can you see me?
Am I clear to you?
Picture me rollin', nigga, legit
Free like O.J. all day, you can't stop me

'Pac
Hey
What's happening
Not motherfucking double R, Richie baby
What's happening baby, you know how we do it
Yeah nigga, you know I'm up out this bitch
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
Fo' sho', hey
Observe
And you ain't going back?
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
This is for the honeys, the superstar
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
Well let 'em know

You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me 'til you sure
I ain't begging just trying to relocate between your legs
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..

Shut me down if you want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared, go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts

I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
Of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touching, erotic fuckin'
My up and down with no interruptions
Have no intentions of busting until you learn your lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass

You can ride out with sport coat, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
And I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
That I's the nigga and sport coat can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right

Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
Totally sweating, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissing 'til yo' head swang
I'm so into you, witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out; do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker, can I dig?
[Verse 7: Richie Rich & 
2Pac
]
It's on and popping, now you see what I was seeing
Why your eyes rolling? Loosen up, girl, I ain't going
Nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player
, I'd rather be ya nigga

I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
So I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life

See, I don't like a motherfucker that be all lonely and shit
All up under me, tellin' me we havin' gold
In case she gold ringin' when I'm comin' home
And all of that ol' crazy shit, what type of life I live

Now peep it, here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin', I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture: me and you in ecstasy?
Don't be upset, it's good sex, when you next to me
Do you wanna test me, put your tired head on my chest?
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
You can call me when you need me
1-800-SKYPAGE, when you wanna see me
'Cause I can be your man and, baby, you can be my lady
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
Run the streets

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'

Yo 'Pac, you know I'm 16 strong behind you boo
But I gotta do what I gotta do
I gotta run the streets, you know
I ain't no ""clean up in one minute"" type of ho
You know

Now me and you was cool, but I ain't the one to play the fool
Can't make no money in bed, so ain't no future fuckin' you
I ain't the bitch to love ya, can't do a damn thang for you
If you ain't about money, nine times outta ten I'll ignore you
It's a man's world, but real women make the shit go 'round
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
Throw up the block 'cause nothin' stops my chips
I boss play ya with this, then twist you lame tricks
Holla if you understand my plan, ladies, fuck havin' babies
By them shady-ass niggas, swearin' he can save me
My strategy's official, checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss you
Soft as tissue, so my next issue is how to diss you
They call me Storm, from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest mothafucka 'til his heart's warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just 'cause we bone don't mean you own me, nigga, I'm grown

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'
You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'

Hahhahaha, yeah nigga
Let a nigga hang out with the homies, you know, baby
Ay, a nigga that hang out more will come home and love you better—you feel me, sweetheart? Let a nigga be free!
Don't have a nigga all up under you!
Let him run with his niggas!
Let the nigga run the street, boo, let him run the streets!

I'd rather run the streets than make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that I'm choosin'
Don't get in confusion
Because I'm known for showin' examples how I do it
Thinkin' I'm new to this because I'm younger
Where I'll only leave you suspicious and to wonder
And at the end I make a come up
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B
Fetti over somethin' that's tellin' me don't run the streets

So tell me, am I wrong
For tryin' to communicate through a song?
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
All my homies is waitin' for me
Plottin' on plans that we made and all the fun that it's gonna be
So meet me at 3' and don't be late, nigga
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in 'cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die I'll be gang related
Got me strivin' for a million, stayin' motivated
Now that we made it, it's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, 'cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil nigga tryna make it
I only got one chance so I gotta take it
You never know when it's all gonna happen
The rappin' or the drugs
But until then give me love and let me run the streets

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'
You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be be waitin'

Let a nigga run the streets, boo
I hate you, hahah, I'll call you back
Just let me hang with my niggas
Why you actin' like that Michel'le, ha?
You know nigga wanna kick it with his homeboys and shit
I told you I was comin' back later on, right?
So you don't believe a nigga?
Just cook for a nigga, pleaaase!
Make some of that shit you made last meal
Some of them ribs and shit
I'll be back through later tonight, I'm havin' some weed
We finna drink some Hennessy and some Alize
We finna eat that foods, smoke a lil blunt
Lay up in the bed, watch out Jay Leno or somethin'
Then after that, shit, do whatever comes to mind, baby
Just let a nigga run with the homies
Let me go kick it with my niggas
When I come back, I be all yours, for real

You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'
You can run the streets with your thugs
I'll be waitin' for you
Until you get through, I'll be waitin'",https://genius.com/2pac-run-tha-streetz-lyrics
Shorty Wanna Be a Thug,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug!
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Was a nice middle-class nigga
But no one knew the evil he'd do when he got a little bigger
You'd often find him blazed, for puffing on a Newport
Plotting on another way to catch a case
Was only 16, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas, but you the only one ain't tellin'
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me it's a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commence to money-makin' tactics, uh
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My finger's on the trigger
Tell the Lord to make way for another straight thug nigga
I'm sitting, getting buzzed, looking for some love
From the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug

Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, said he's wanna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's gonna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Straight from the hall to the pen'
An adolescent nigga standing way higher than six feet ten
He carried weight, like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on playa haters, if them mothafuckas act tuff
Then that's when, a lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast, pull the trigger
Could take the life of a young nigga, guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the nigga's all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Been laced with this game 'til it's a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear, and that ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm tryin' to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark, getting buzzed, looking for some love
Out with the homies, ‘cause shorty wanna be a thug

Said he's gonna be, said he's gonna be
One day he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he's gonna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he's wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug
Said he wanna be, one day he's gonna be
Said he wanna be, shorty's gonna be a thug

Shorty's gonna be a thug
Little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
Gotta stay sharp, nigga, play your part!
Got plenty of time (you bad mothafuckas)
You only get three mistakes, and then it's life, big baby

We finna talk about these scandalous hoes
I can talk about scandalous bitches
I know you can!
I know you, that's why we finna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, nigga, stop fuckin' around with the piano, nigga
Just drop that shit like uhh, this here

I met you through my homie, now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed 'cause baby that shit was so phoney
It's not for me, you see no lovin' from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby, you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you, baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggas, playa, let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, never breathin' again
It's scandalous, I never liked your backstabbin' ass, trick
Used to watch you money grabbin', who you baggin', bitch?
Ready to bust, in the city, you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous

Scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
Scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)

How's it hangin'? 'Cause baby, from the back, this shit is bangin'
I've been stressing in this ghetto game, trying to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin', as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a bitch who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch, so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't know where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you saying?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me, I got her
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga, I'm so scandalous

Scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
Scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)

Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin' on gettin' riches
I'm spittin' at tricks 'cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin' for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggas doin' time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin' well
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on calling me
I'm tokin' free on the highway, formulatin' plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., 'cause it's so scandalous

Scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
Scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)
She's so scandalous (She's so scandalous, she's so scandalous)

Ayo, how the pretty bitch be, the more scandalous the ho be
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)
A bitch can be like 15, fuckin' with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for everything
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin' intelligent
When these niggas get to trickin', hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game
Watch them hoes
All you niggas out there
Beware these lying-ass scandalous bitches
They will leave yo' ass on E",https://genius.com/2pac-skandalouz-lyrics
Thug Passion,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Alright, new drink: one part Alizé, one part Cristal
Thug's passion, baby, y'all know what time it is
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
Now, if you with me, pour a glass and drink with a nigga
You know what I mean?
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols... alcoholics
I'm just tryin' to turn you into motherfuckin' thugs
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby

Man, I could, pull like they dick would, be good until it's relevant
But I'm a straight soldier that I'll roll up a nigga like it's heaven sent
Trippin' over dead presidents, they got these derelicts
I thought was down with this business, tryin' to clown and get a cent
And so rather than stand forever, been thinkin'
Drinkin' over a felony and hell of me and how it will be in hella shit
People tellin' me to cool out, but they ain't feelin' me
A motherfuckin' fool 'bout my fuckin' cheddar cheese
And it pleases, passion of mine, thuggin'
Huggin' plenty of G's and laughin' while passin' through times
And all these backstabbers be watchin', just keep it plain
I'ma keep it the same partner, just take it the simple game
I can, pinkle with rain twinklin', diamonds and things go blinkin'
Enough to hold me 'til I'm old and wrinklin'
These adversaries, they gon' have to be worryin'
'Cause I'ma be illin', fulfillin' my passion
'Til I'm buryin' my thug passion

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

Now what if me turn this Hennessy into a robbery?
The prophecy probably suddenly switch how it supposed to be
And dirty money can't be evil 'cause it's fillin' up my tummy
Born in a position, death collision was futuristic
Twistin' riches, but there's only one way to make more
So I'm standin' on the corner tryin' to hustle in the snow
And my bigger bro, couldn't know
But buy a .44, blastin' at playa haters wantin' more
With a thug passion

Puttin' down, mashin', control by this thug's passion
Unlike them other bustas pistol blastin', I'm askin' what happened
To the niggas who kept it real like they claim to?
That's what money and fame do, see, they ain't true
Travelin' this road, my poor soul has been consolidated
With all this bullshit that I done tolerated
How I made it can be easily stated
It's like my hardest bring the grip with the passion
Left me to fuckin' greatest, load up and take shit

Make it to some high dollar gangsta shit
Jack a stack 'til we got enough bank to split
[Verse 4: Storm & 
Jewell
]
Creep with me, through that immortal flow 
(That's right)
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row 
(Yeah)
Make your move, so I can throw your mind a curve
While I'll be blowin' up the scene, like my nigga Mr. Herb
Take a toke, as your heart goes full arrest
I got the bomb, so nigga, fuck the rest
You need a thug to get you flowin' and let that loc see smoke
Feelin' the strokes of the 9 squeeze tight and slow

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

They say money don't make the man, but damn, I'm makin' money
Observin' you motherfuckers 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it, but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me 'bout to act a fool quick
Sippin' on some Alizé and Cristal
Meanwhile, buy me a drink and get to winkin' at me
She smiles; a nigga's full of passion, satisfaction is everlastin'
""How does it feel?"" What I'm askin' while I'm rubbin' on that ass
""Why you laughin'?""See, I'm diggin' as if I'm curious
Full blown and furious, baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical, my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby, I'm born to ball, thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a potion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion
[Chorus: Jewell & 
DJ Quik

I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
Thug passion
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh
Thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Give me some of your thug passion, baby, ohh

Tradin War Stories,All Eyez on Me,1996,"A military mind, nigga

We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes
We tradin' war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyes

Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday
And feared men grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli was my tutor, Donald Goines, my father figure
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Henceforth, we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of my niggas strapped sippin' on 'Gnac
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin' 'til I die, these streets got me cravin' thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin'
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'

They call it overthuggin' and shit
But I was just a younger nigga, gettin' older and lovin' this shit
But what was I doin' in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first
Facin' termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all
These playa hatin' niggas position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat, people, I'm tryna tell you

Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin' greenery
Considered a BG, but I'm off in this game something D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And wide open, the ridin' and smokin'
Collidin' with foes in the worst place
Y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us, in the first place
Y'all real OGs, droppin' game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk 'cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories

I breaks them off with this gangsta war story tale
Stacking loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumping insane
Call me Bo Loc Major Pain, gun-slang and moving 'caine
I be the nigga that's pulling the trigger
And dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
Never been no sign for men call
How we bucks them down on the way to the ground
Ain't nothing but the hog in me
Plus, stompin' steel toed, killin' up hoes and keep mobbin' G
It ain't no calling the funk off
Don't be funking with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
And had them bitch niggas hauled off

Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscing, and catchin' flashbacks when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Thugging Immortal when got some war stories for you

Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waitin' for the nymphos: that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you wanna fuck me?
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on – still down?
Met you standin' at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right

Oh, shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't wanna talk to me just to see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number? Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme, take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind, bet in a minute you'll find
It's time, let the Outlawz play

When We Ride,All Eyez on Me,1996,"Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts
Of chin checks and eye swolls
They know you watchin'
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture, if you will
Seven deadly human beings blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down
And be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs, Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true

My adversaries crumble, when we rumble it's a catastrophe
Out for revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus, my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come

They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two-game table
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
Rap-related, criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
'Til the end, I'm tellin' all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze
To touch me, you need ten of these
Complete most wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggas bleed, I see Mo

I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion-dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash, bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'mma last yo past all these Glass Joes
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate

My alias is motherfuckin' Napoleon, and I'd rather be
Robbin' again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin'
But it ain't nothin', and I got no time for no bluffin'
Befo' a nigga finish with puttin' in work
I better end up with somethin'
I think these niggas got the game fucked up
If they don't believe
That a young nigga like me would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin' cases, fuck probation
Is what I'm screamin' when these money hungry cops be chasin'

Thug niggas 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches
Ask me why when we ride
Thug niggas 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches
Ask me why when we ride

It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, ridin' Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin' bitches and snitches and trippin' on sets
Inglewood's banger, keepin' one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin' no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini

They call me EDI, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin' up on these niggas easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin' somethin', so I'mma commence
To dumpin' stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin' Thuggin' to my fuckin' last note, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole? Don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin' this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride

My alias Kadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky, quick to hit your bitch if she jock me
Severely addicted to livin' like a fuckin' felon
While beefin' with rookie cops, the cookie rocks a nigga sellin'
Since a shorty I been livin' life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin' like a giant, and I ain't lyin'
It's like it's me against myself with all these
Backstabbin' snakes grabbin' at my fuckin' wealth

Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty-cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
That increase while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the Glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make 'em feel a nigga when I'm mashin'
Now I'm surpassin' any assassin'

Thug niggas 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches
Ask me why when we ride
Thug niggas 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches
Ask me why when we ride
Thug niggas 'til we die
No mercy on these playa hatin' bitches

Makaveli, Hussein, Kastro, Kadafi, Mussolini
Amin, Napoleon, Khomein
What y'all really wanna do?
Haha, like them niggas said
""What would you do if you could fuck with me and my crew?""
Hehahahahaha, Thug Life, yeah nigga
Flashin' on niggas, Thug Life, right? This year we Thug Life
But we Outlaw Immortalz
We die, nigga, but we multiply, we like legends, nigga, like forever
Like, I'll make you famous, motherfucker
I'm talkin' about Newsweek and Time Magazine
And all that old good shit
My niggas make the papers, baby

Wonda Why They Call U Bitch,All Eyez on Me,1996,"You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

Look here, Miss Thang, hate to salt your game
But you's a money-hungry woman and you need to change
In the locker room, all the homies do is laugh
High fives ‘cause another nigga played your ass
It was said you were sleezy, even easy
Sleepin' around for what you need, see
It's your thing, and you can shake it how you wanna
Give it up free or make your money on the corner
But don't be bad, play the game, get mad and change
Then you wonder why these motherfuckers call you names
Still lookin' for a way out, and that's okay
I can see you wanna stray, there's a way out
Keep your mind on your money, enroll in school
And as the years pass by, you can show them fools
But you ain't tryin' to hear me ‘cause you're stuck
You're headin' for the bathroom, 'bout to get tossed up
Still lookin' for a rich man, you dug a ditch
Got your legs up tryin' to get rich
I love you like a sister, but you need to switch
And that's why they called you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

You leave your kids with your mama
‘Cause your headin' for the club
In a skin-tight miniskirt, lookin' for some love
Got them legs wide open while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 'bout his car
I guess he said he had a Lexus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex?
I pass by, can't hold back tears inside
‘Cause Lord knows, for years I tried
And all the other people on my block hate your guts
Then you wonder why they stare and call you slut
It's like your mind don't understand
You don't have to kill your dreams plottin' schemes on a man
Keep your head up
, legs closed, eyes open
Either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin'
I'm hearin' rumors, so you need to switch
And niggas wouldn't call you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch
I betcha
You wonda why they call you bitch
You wonda why they call you bitch

I guess times gettin' hard, even harder for you
‘Cause hey now, got a baby on the way now
More money from the county, and thanks to the welfare
You're about to get your hair done
Got a dinner date, can't be late
Trick or treat, sweet thang got another trick to meet
The way he did it it was smooth
Plottin' while he gamin' you so, baby, peep the rules
I should've seen it in the first case, the worst case
I should've never called you back in the first place
I remember back in high school, baby, you was fast
Straight sex when you moved your ass
But now things change, ‘cause you don't look the same
Let the ghetto get the best of you, baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
And finally be at peace
So where your niggas at now? ‘Cause everybody left
They stepped, and left you on your own
See, I loved you like a sister, but you died too quick
And that's why we called you bitch—I betcha!

You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
I betcha, bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch
You wonda why we call you bitch

Dear Ms. Delores Tucker, keep stressin' me
Fuckin' with a motherfuckin' mind
I figured you wanted to know
You know, why we call them hoes bitches
And maybe this might help you understand
It ain't personal, strictly business, baby, strictly business
So If you wonder why we call you bitch
You wonder why we call you bitch
If you wonder why we call you bitch

I ain't got no motherfuckin' friends
That's why I fucked yo' bitch, you fat motherfucka!
(Take money) West Side, Bad Boy killas
(Take money) (You know) You know who the realest is
(Take money) niggas, we bring it too
That's a'ight, ha ha
(Take money)

First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus, Puffy tryna see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. is some mark-ass bitches
We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real Gs
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Ha ha)
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get yo' caps peeled, you know

See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up! (Yeah)

Check this out, you motherfuckers know what time it is
I don't even know why I'm on this track
Y'all niggas ain't even on my level
I'ma let my lil' homies ride
On you bitch-made ass Bad Boy bitches, feel it!

Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Biggie Smalls just got dropped
Little Mu', pass the MAC
 
and let me hit him in his back
Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer
, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!

Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, uh
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, 
it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, motherfucker, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (ha ha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Motherfucker, I hit 'em up!

I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Lil' Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
About to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Little Ceas' in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, hahahaha
They don't wanna see us
Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us
How the fuck they gonna be the mob
When we always on our job?
We millionaires
Killin' ain't fair, but somebody gotta do it
Oh yeah, Mobb Deep, you wanna fuck with us?
You little young-ass motherfuckers
Don't one of you niggas got sickle-cell or somethin'?
You're fuckin' with me, nigga
You fuck around and have a seizure or a heart attack
You better back the fuck up
Before you get smacked the fuck up
This is how we do it on our side
Any of you niggas from New York that wanna bring it, bring it!
But we ain't singin', we bringin' drama
Fuck you and yo' motherfuckin' mama!
We gon' kill all you motherfuckers!
Now when I came out I told you it was just about Biggie
Then everybody had to open their mouth
With a motherfuckin' opinion
Well, this is how we gonna do this: fuck Mobb Deep! Fuck Biggie!
Fuck Bad Boy as a staff, record label, and as a motherfuckin' crew!
And if you wanna be down with Bad Boy, then fuck you too!
Chino XL, fuck you too!
All you motherfuckers, fuck you too!
(Take money, take money)
All of y'all motherfuckers, fuck you, die slow!
Motherfucker, my .44 make sho' all y'all kids don't grow!
You motherfuckers can't be us or see us
We motherfuckin' Thug Life ridas
Westside 'til we die!
Out here in California, nigga, we warned ya
We'll bomb on you motherfuckers! We do our job!
You think you mob? Nigga, we the motherfuckin' mob!
Ain't nothin' but killas
And the real niggas, all you motherfuckers feel us
Our shit goes triple and 4-quadruple
You niggas laugh 'cause our staff got guns under they motherfuckas belts
You know how it is: when we drop records, they felt
You niggas can't feel it, we the realest
Fuck 'em, we Bad Boy killas!",https://genius.com/2pac-hit-em-up-lyrics

Against all odds, up in the studio gettin' blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke

21-gun salute, dressed in fatigues, black jeans and boots
I just appeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took five like me
You live in fantasies, nigga, I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now he out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why a nigga blowed 'em out
Next time grown folks talking, nigga close your mouth!
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall
To let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy, let's be honest: you a punk or you will see me with gloves?
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein' a thug?
And you can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's goin' on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with MAC's, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers tryin' to advance

Jewelry, fast cars and he's known for flashin'
Listen while I take you back and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin' for the feds
Same crime, different trials, nigga, picture what he said
And did I mention?
Promised to payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin', the world is mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust, but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine, on everything I love
I'll destroy everything you touch
Play the game, nigga; all out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga: ""Why you lie?""
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots to Tut, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga, this M.O.B

He did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ridin' for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin' dead
Switched sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin' or dead
Lord, listen to me, God don't like ugly, it was written
Ayo, Nas, your whole damn style is bitten
You heard my melody (This nigga sounds like Rakim!)
Read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life
So what's a ""chazzer,"" Nas? Niggas that don't rhyme right
You've seen too many movies
Load 'em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die — goodbye!
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me? Nigga

2Pac, don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed
And I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me
Remember what my pops told me

My family tree consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin', known to hustle, screamin', ""fuck they feelings!""
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this:
""Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know niggas gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now, rule one: get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, 'cause they breed envy
Now, rule two is a hard one: watch for phonies
Keep your enemies close, nigga, watch your homies""
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me, I smiled
Picture jewels bein' handed to an innocent child
I never knew, in my lifetime, I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw
, 
studyin' rules
Now, papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
Or come to grips with bein' written on my enemy's walls
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nothin' free, get back what you earned
No doubt, gettin' higher than a motherfucka, bless me, please
This Thug Life'll be the death of me
C'mon, yeah

And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my pops told me
Blasphemy!

Nuf for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie, but holdin' my bird in a cloud
(Remember what my pops told me)
Using the name of the lord in vain
(blas-blas-blasphemy, blasphemy)
(Remember what my pops told me)
While de people in de ghetto feel nuff pain

We pro'ly in Hell, already, our dumb asses not knowin'
Everybody kissin' ass to go to Heaven ain't goin'
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin' devil niggas daily
Plus the media be crucifyin' brothers severely
Tell me I ain't God's son; nigga, momma a virgin
We got evicted, had to leave the 'burbs
Back in the ghetto, doin' wild shit
Lookin' at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled a fat one up, deadly
Babylon beware, comin' for the Pharoah's kids
Retaliation, makin' legends off the shit we did
Still bullshittin', niggas in Jerusalem waitin' for signs
God comin', she's just takin' her time (haha!)
Livin' by the Nile, while the water flow
I’m contemplatin' plots, wonderin' where the thought’ll go
Brothas gettin' shot, comin' back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga, check it (that raw shit)

And I remember what my poppa told me
Remember what my poppa told me

The preacher want me buried, why? 'Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead? That's eternal fire
Why you got these kids' minds thinkin' that they evil?
While the preacher bein' freaky, you say, ""honor God's people""
Should we cry when the Pope die? My request:
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama, tell me: am I wrong? Is God just another cop
Waitin' to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin' up cash to the leaders
Knowin' damn well they ain't gonna feed us
In my brain, how can you explain time in B.C.?
It's hard enough to live, now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man
Well, he should understand times in this crime land
My thug nation, do what you gotta do
But know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is Heaven just another door? And my people say

Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done
In Earth as it is in Heaven

Bomb First (My Second Reply),The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,1996,"In today's music news: the ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur has just released another album under the alias ""Makaveli."" Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artists' street dates in fear of a wipeout in retail inter-chart movement. Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album, resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character of not only Mr Shakur but of Death Row Records as well. Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac's – excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on Mobb Sleep, Notorious P.I.G., and several other New York rappers. JAY-Z from ""Hawaiian Sophie"" fame, Big Little whatever, and several other corny-sounding motherfuckers are understandably shaken up by this release. The question everybody wants to know is: why'd they get this nigga started? 2Pac – rather Makaveli – was not available for comment but released this statement:

It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches
Power and money, ridaz and punks
Which side are you on?
*Heartbeat* *Gunshots*
*Encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fuckin' talkin'?
You niggas still breathin'? Fuckin' roaches
A'ight, it's the Raid on cockroaches
Punk motherfuckers, this is it (Makaveli The Don)
Killuminati Style (all day) (up in your ass)
(Bomb first) (Outlaw Ridahz) Solo shit, bring it!

Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
Money-makin' plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me rise, located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty, (huh) in every city
You'll find me, look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me, know I mean?
I hit the scene, niggas duckin' from my guillotine stare
I'm right there, my every word a fuckin' nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs, down to die for y'all
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in ’em
Cut ’em down, to Hell is where we send ’em
My whole team trained to explode, ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them ""my bitch-nigga eaters""
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life runnin' through my veins so I'm strong
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer, JAY-Z die too
Lookin' out for Mobb Deep, nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay!
West Coast rider, comin' right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I want money, hoes, sex and weed
I won't rest until my road dog's free – bomb first

We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first

For so many days, in so many ways we've been duckin' strays
They delivers, but still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin' to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission, sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch, yo I'm dyin' with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a ma'fuckin' Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made ""Paparazzi""
If you ain't in this rap game for the motherfuckin' cash, mane
Then what is your motherfuckin' purpose? Narcing service
E.D.I. Mean, born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first, bitch!

Biatch! Come on, bring it, down with it!
Then we ride
Come on, bring it
Bomb first when we ride
Hey, get that nigga!

Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin' patent leather
Causin' massive terror, y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin, you're tellin' fairy tales, dunn
""King of New York"" like you the motherfuckin' one?
But I'm from Jers', we don't play that shit
From the Clare down to North Bricks all my niggas flippin’ chips
Gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Tryna creep through these halls and brawls without scarred by a revolve'
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the youngin with the 9 ready to put in my time

Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, but bomb first
We bomb first when we ride
Please reconsider 'fore you die
G's and thug niggas on the rise
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first

Let us pray, my nigga
'Cause we definitely have sinned",https://genius.com/2pac-bomb-first-my-second-reply-lyrics

How do we keep the music playin'?
You're listenin' to the sounds of one thug
One thug, one thug, 
How do we get ahead?
You're listenin' to the sounds of…

I wake up early in the mornin', mind state so military
Suckers fantasizin' pictures of a young brother buried
Was it me, the weed or this life I lead?
If daytime is for suckers then tonight we breathe
Out for all that, knowin' that this world bring drawbacks
Look how they shiver once I deliver these raw raps
Meet me at the cemetery, dressed in black
Tonight we honor the dead, those who won't be back
So, if I die, do the same for me, shed no tears
An outlaw thug livin' in this game for years
Why worry? Hope to God, get me high when I'm buried
Knowin' deep inside only a few love me
Don't rush me to the gates of Heaven
Let me picture for a while, how I lived for my days as a child
I wonder now, how do we outlast?
Always get cash, stay strong if we all mash; hold ya head!
[Chorus: Tyrone Wrice &

How do we keep the music playin'?
Yes, you got to hold ya head!
How do we get ahead? 
Hold ya head!
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
Yes, you got to hold ya head!
Livin' fast, too fast

These felonies be like prophecies
Beggin' me to stop ‘cause these
Lawyers gettin' money every time they knock us
Snatchin' pockets lyrically, suckers flee when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli, half the rap game ghost
Exposed foes with my hocus-pocus flows, they froze
Now suckers idolize my chosen blows
And mo' money mean litigatin', mo' playa hatin'
Got a cell at the pen' for me waitin'—is this my fate?
Miss me with that misdemeanor thinkin', me fall back?
Never that, too much Tequila drinkin', we all that
Make them understand me? Hell nah, this ain't my posse
Everyone with me is family, ‘cause everybody's got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision, this life we livin'
Got us all meetin' up in prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog, written in blood
Sayin', ""Please show a playa love""—hold ya head! (Hold it!)
[Chorus: Tyrone Wrice &

How do we keep the music playin'?
You got to hold ya head!
How do we get ahead? 
Come on, hold ya head!
Too many young black brothers are dyin'
Yes, hold ya head!
Livin' fast, too fast
The weed got me tweakin' in my mind, I'm thinkin'…

God bless the child that can hold his own
Indeed, enemies bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be the last to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation in this world of greed
Currency means nothin' if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy, take the game from me
I hope for better days, trouble comes naturally
Runnin' from authorities 'til they capture me
And my aim is to spread mo' smiles than tears
Utilize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right, rest yo' head
Tradin' conversations all night, bless the dead
To the homies that I used to have that no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul, watchin' time pass
Through the glass of my drop-top Rolls; hold ya head!

Outlawz, go ahead, in this
No doubt
Death Row, Makaveli Records
You can call me daddy, uh
I'll be ya daddy, that's right, uh
Just like daddy
Fo' the ladies
Hahaha

Come with me and in time we'll grow
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Never leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

I met her when she was younger
Real daddy died when she was younger
Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
Her eyes shined of love, a diamond in the rough
The kind that you could love; not yet touch, but so much, potential
Youngster let me guide ya mental
And to a place, with a sourness of pain you'll never taste
By God's grace, you was born with that face
Nothin' but pure beauty; so for an eternity, I feel it's my duty
To be a souljah (souljah) yeah, baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy

To alleviate the stress, spendin' time wit' you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
Screamin' loud goin' all out, damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house, watchin' the kids
Through the whole bid in the V-I, I see ya daily
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed, I thank God every time I hit it
Hopin' you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Screamin' like you dyin' every time I'm fuckin' you
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
No need to fear so much insanity, and through the years
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me

Come with me and in time we'll grow
Dedicate slow jams on the radio-oh why
Know ya happy, I can feel ya passion
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy, come on
Sunshine turns to rain
Baby, I can take away ya pain
If ya trust me
Close ya eyes, feel the magic
Neva leave when ya need me
I'll do ya just like daddy

Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
With mean sounds tougher than bristles
But when you cry I'll be ya tissue
Back in the county written letters, how I miss you
Givin' you credit, apologetic how I diss you
Kiss you for thinkin' like a mona and on a level
And sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilation
For a total twine ya, we right behind ya true
Life just me and you, no tellin' what we could do
Gettin' high between the sheets, make the shit right here discrete
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy

Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya, lost soul lookin' for shelter
On late night accept it, treat ya good, won't disrespect ya
My age is young, out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy, you know I raised ya hun
Placed her under my wing, showed her how we swing
Now she rolling blunts for her king
One day labelled thug misses, the essence of my ghetto sisters
Hugs and kisses, that's just for me to be a father figure

Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall, learnin' right from wrong
They say my ghetto instrumental detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me for the outcome, ban my records – check it
Don't have to bump this, but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin' blinded
Hennessy got me feelin' bad, time to stop drinkin'
Rollin' in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin'?
Sittin' in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way, but still I got so far to go
Dear Mama, don't worry, I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu that I love her, but it's hard today
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak – all I heard was…

Lookin' for a better wayyy
My brothers and sisters, it's time to bail
‘Cause even thug niggas prayyy
Hopin' God hear me, I entered the game
Look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent – casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
When I gave her the keys to her own house, this yo land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin' time fly, I love my people, do or die
But I wonder why we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
Mama pushed me out her womb, told me, ""Nigga, get paid!""
No one can understand me – the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin' heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say… (Thug Life, baby!)

Hopin' that it gets me high

I feel crazy (crazy)

God, help me out here, ‘cause I'm possessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
‘Cause money's like a strong prescription
Drug, it's got me addicted
To the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin' about the paper
With the pictures of the president's head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin' plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin' money ‘cause it's cursed
Makin' money makes a difference day by day
So I gotta stay paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin' to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life do 'em right or did life leave 'em dumb?
Who has the answers? I wonder, I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
Or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) ‘Cause they don't even know
A million things run through my mind
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin' time

Life Of An Outlaw,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,1996,"In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand

Why explain the game?
Niggas ain't listenin', stuck in positions
 
if victims can't stand the heat, then stay the fuck out the kitchen
Half these busters switchin', lookin' at me mean, itchin'
Givin' suckers plenty space, have these bitch niggas snitchin'
Where are we now, guns found daily
The Feds trail me in hoax that they could finally nail me
For sellin' dope
, they backwards make the track burst
Whenever I rap, attack
Words been known to explode on contact
Extreme at times, blinded by my passion and fury
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin' my jewelry
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me, truly effective
The shit you heard ain't do me justice, got a death wish, bitch
Run, but face being traced, by the infrared beam
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team
Ain't nobody holdin' you back
Explode the track to confetti
Unload it, 'cause niggas ain't ready
The life of an outlaw

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand

Code 3: attack formation, pull out your pistols
Keep an eye out for the devils 'cause they itchin' to get you
Merciless madman, screamin' kamikaze in tongue
Automatic gunfire, makin' all my enemies run
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin'?
Indeed a possibility that's part of chasin' cream
Dope got me hatin' fiends
Scheme with my team, just a chosen few
My foes victim of explosives, come closer exhale the fumes
We got memories, fadin' fast
A slave for cash accelerate, mash, blast, then dash
Don't look now! How you like it, raw?
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the Outlawz
Never surrender, death before dishonor, stay free
I'm thugged out, fuck the world 'cause this is how they made me
Scarred but still breathin' believe in me
And you could see the victory, a warrior in jewels, will you picture me?
Life of an outlaw

In the life we live as thugs (No doubt)
Everybody fuckin' with us (Yes!), so can't you see (life of an outlaw)
It's hard to be a man (Soldiers in position, attack formation)
Ridin' with my guns in hand
(No retreat, no surrender)

City under siege, it's like I can't even breathe
I'm from the state of car thieves
 G.E.D. from the streets
Plenty beef I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene
Mobb peep! They sneak up from behind tryin' to creep
No halfs with no straps, jack, it's on to bounce back
An ounce of wrath so bad, it snatched my style on death
Tell the gripper I was sent to get ya, snip with clippers
Get the picture, I wrote my life down as a scripture

And still I'm lost in the land of the lonely where ain't nobody holy
A matter of a fact, we unholy Everybody livin' soley
For themselves, too high strung to lend help
To somebody who be needin' it
You know we lost hope and he needin' it
But the evil it's forever
But I'm rappin' low down, scandalous like a tramp is
All for the street fame on how to be managed
To plan shit 6 months in advanced to what we plotted
Approached the goal on swole and now I got it

Uh, I crack my window, knowin' they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin'
Attach a strap under my pillow, hand to hand like we freakin'
Creepin' deep into the mornin'
Peepin' out the weak while they yawnin'
And let my clout speak for itself
No doubt, outlaw, outta my mind outta time you're all blind
Some kind of life of mine if K-Dog don't mind
Findin' it funny, matter of fact, 'cause it is perhaps
Finally I'll adapt to it, over the years as an outlaw
[Bridge:

Ayy Napoleon
What's up, nigga?
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah
Would you kill for me, nigga?
On my grandmother, nigga
Ayy, yo
What's up
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now
Watch out

Well, now they all say that vultures and parasites
Snakes are all alike, thug life break night
Drink 'til we fist fight, life or death
But you can't win with a vest
Won't be no breathin' for the reason, punk bitch on your breath
I see day is dark, and I admit it's dark
So chase on the ave., hide your stash, beware from them marks
Ayy yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left up in your belly
And let me bust back to them niggas 'til they all cold and sweaty

In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs
Everybody fuckin' with us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man
Ridin' with my guns in hand
In the life we live as thugs

Me and My Girlfriend,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,1996,"Shit, you mothafuckin' right!
I'm the bitch that's keepin' it live and keepin' it hot
When you punk-ass niggas don't
Nigga, west side! What?! Bring it on!

Look for me, lost in the whirlwind
'96 Bonnie and Clyde, me and my girlfriend
Doin' 85 when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin
Born as a ghetto child,
 
raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)

Our childhood years recall the tears, heart laced with venom
Smokin' sherm, drinkin' malt liquor — father, forgive 'em
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin'
Fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush while she bail out bustin'
Fuck 'em all, watch 'em fall screamin'
Automatic gunfire exorcisin' all demons
My mafioso messiah, my congregation high,
 
ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggas unite
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place
I could hardly wait to bust freely
Got you red-hot, you so happy to see me
Make the front page, prime time, live on TV
Nigga, my girlfriend, baby 45 but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop

What?! I'm bustin' on you punk-ass niggas
Run, nigga, run! I'm on yo' ass, nigga
Run, nigga! Duck and hide
When I'm bustin' on all you bitches!
Run, nigga! Yeah, Westside!
Uh! Uh! Uh! Die, nigga, die!

My girlfriend blacker than the darkest night
When niggas act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga, my girlfriend, though we separated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was 9
Started out my life of crime with you
Bought you some shells when you turned 22
It's true, nothin' compares to the satisfaction
That I feel when we out mashin'; me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I was too immature to understand your ways
Inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat you, the secret to keep you
Being faithful, ‘cause now cheating's lethal
We're closer than the hands of time
Deeper than the drive of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin' niggas as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes
Now it's time for war, never leave me, baby
I'm paranoid, sleepin' with you loaded by my bedside, crazy
Jealous when you hang with the fellas, I wait patiently alone
Anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin' by the phone, this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realest
So if you ever need me, call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend

I love finger-fuckin' you, all of a sudden I'm hearin' thunder
When you bust a nut, niggas be duckin' or takin' numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin' for drama
While unleashin' on the old-timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
The only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin' for
Talkin' to me, beggin' me to just take you around
Seventeen, like Brandy you just wanna be down
Talkin' loud when I tell you be quiet
You move the crowd, bustin' rounds, activatin' a riot
That's why I love you so, no control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit, you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend,
 
the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby, witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home: me and my girlfriend

All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Just me and my girlfriend
All I need in this life of sin
Me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end
Me and my girlfriend

Toss It Up,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,1996,"The money behind the dreams
My right hand, my other Capo in this big motherfuckin' war we got
My other Capo in this big-ass
Conglomerate called Death Row
Snoop motherfuckin Dogg, Tha Doggfather
And who we hear comin' through right now?
Makaveli the Don
Feel this, Killuminati

Lord have mercy, father help us all
Since you supplied your phone number, I can't help but call
Time for action, conversating, we relaxing, kicking back
Got you curious for thug passion, now picture that
Tongue-kissing, hand full of hair, look in my eyes
Time to make the bed rock, baby look how it rise
Me and you moving in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweating up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespecting when I tongue-kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect?
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, getting busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your hips and glide?
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got you lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shaking, back-breaking
When we're tossing it up

Feel this baby, I like the way it's going down
When nobody's around, slip-slide ride
Giving me that nice smile
The thing I like, what I want to give all night
You and me alone, everybody's gone, toss it up
Baby let's get it on!
I like the way you please me, baby
The sexy way you tease me, shorty
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body's hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me
I like the way you give it to me, baby

I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up

Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on
Play on, play on, play on, play on

Oh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm, that want you lady
Oh, don't act so shady
Baby, your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thing
You make me wanna sing
Girl, you make my bells ring
Make them go ting-a-ling!
Nasty man, I'm here again
Don't want it to ever end
It's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady, lady
Your body the kind I like, a
Big booty, titillating delight
Back it up, yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me

I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
I like the way you give it to me
Let me see you toss it up
So won't you play on

How do you want it? What's your phone number? I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin' for paydays
No longer Dre Day: arrivederci!
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plotting child's play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alizé
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gonna run to?
Laugh at you suckers 'cause you similar
Pretending to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screaming ""Compton"", but you can't return, you ain't heard?
Brothers pissed 'cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, 'cause we untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushing you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust? Only time reveals
Toss it up

On and on, yeah, and on
Let me see you toss it up (Toss it up)
Won't you toss it up (Yeah, no doubt)
Won't you toss it up, yeah (Let me see you toss it up)
Play on player, play on
Yeah (Let me see you toss it up)
Let me see you toss it up
How can some non-players do a song about tossing it up
And then want to do a player song?
(You so fat, you and Lil' Kim need a weight scale to lay down in bed
We are not little kids, you fat ass, you feelin' threatened)
How can non-players do it? (You know who I'm talking bout)
Teddy Riley, who? Puffy? who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touching us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street, boy
It's on! Toss it up, we took you on
And we took y'all beat (Toss it up)
You know who beat we took, and we took y'all beat
'Cause you wasn't rocking it right! (Toss it up now)
Tired of suckers rocking beats that don't belong to them, toss it up, it's on, it's out there now, it's our beat now
Yeah, toss it up now!",https://genius.com/2pac-toss-it-up-lyrics
White Man’z World,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,1996,"[Intro: 
Malcolm X
 (Movie) & Danny Boy]
""You go bustin' your fist against a stone wall. You're not usin' your brain. That's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you! What makes you ashamed of bein' black?""

Nothin' but love for you, my sister
Might even know how hard it is, no doubt
Bein' a woman, a black woman at that, no doubt
Shit, in this white man's world
Sometimes we overlook the fact
That we be ridin' hard on our sisters
We don't be knowin' the pain we be causin'
In this white man's world
In this white man's world
I ain't sayin I'm innocent in all this
I'm just sayin', in this white man's world
This song is for y'all
For all those times that I messed up, or we messed up

Dear sister, got me twisted up in prison, I miss ya
Cryin', lookin' at my niece's and my nephew picture
They say don't let this cruel world get ya
Kinda suspicious, swearin' one day you might leave me
For somebody that's richer
Twist the cap off the bottle, I take a sip and see tomorrow
Gotta make it if I have to beg or borrow
Readin' love letters; late night, locked down and quiet
If brothers don't receive they mail, best believe we riot
Eatin' Jack-Mack,
 
starin' at the walls of silence
Inside this cage where they capture all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons, never fall for riches
Apologies to my true sisters, far from bitches
Help me raise my Black nation, reparations are due
It's true, caught up in this world I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them, precious boys and girls
Born black in this white man's world—and all I heard was

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

Only thing they ever did wrong (yes!, yes!) was bein' born black 
(no doubt), in this white man’s world. All my ghetto motherfuckers, be proud to be black if you proud to 
have this shit like this, 'cause ain't nobody got it like this (all my little black seeds, born black in the white man's world). All these motherfuckers wanna be like us. They all wanna be like us, to be the have-nots: all hail. 
God bless the child that can hold his own, no motherfuckin' doubt.

Bein' born with less, I must confess, only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homie's head, died in his vest
Shot him to death and left him bleedin' for his family to see
I pass his casket, gently askin', is there a heaven for G's?
My homeboy's doin' life, his baby mama be stressin'
Sheddin' tears when her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at? Mama, why we live so poor?
Why you cryin'? Heard you late night through my bedroom door
Now, do you love me, mama? Why they keep on callin' me nigga?
Get my weight up with my hate and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
And still thuggin' in this jail cell, missin' my block
Hearin' brothers screamin' all night, wishin' they'd stop
Proud to be black, but why we act like we don't love ourselves?
Don't look around, busta, (you sucka!) check yourselves
Know what it means to be black, whether a man or girl
We still strugglin' in this white man's world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
(Born black in this white man's world)
In this world where everyone's blind?
(In this white man's world)
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
(In this white man's world)
To let you know that you're not alone

We must fight for brother 
Mumia
We must fight for brother 
Mutulu
And we must fight for brother Ruchell Magee
We must fight for brother 
Geronimo Pratt
We must fight for , Zulu, 
We must fight for the countless political prisoners
Who are locked up falsely by this white man

So, tell me why you changed to choose a new direction
In the blink of an eye?
My time away just made perfection
Did you think I'd die?
Not gon' cry, why should I care?
Like we holdin' onto lost love that's no longer there
Can you please help me?
God bless me, please keep my seeds healthy
Makin' all my enemies bleed while my G's wealthy
Hopin' they bury me with ammunitions, weed and shells
Just in case they trip in Heaven—ain't no G's in Hell
Sister, sorry for the pain that I caused your heart
I know I'll change if you help me, but don't fall apart
Rest in peace to 
Latasha,
 
Lil' Yummy,
 and 
Kato
Too much for this cold world to take, ended up bein' fatal
Every woman in America, especially black
Bear with me, can't you see that we under attack?
I never meant to cause drama to my sister and mama
Hope we make it to better times, in this white man's world

Who knows what tomorrow brings
In this world where everyone's blind?
And where to go, no matter how far, I'll find
To let you know that you're not alone

""You're out of touch with reality! There are a few of you in a few smoke-filled rooms calling that the mainstream, while the masses of the people—white and black, red, yellow and brown, poor and vulnerable—are suffering in this nation.""

Never that, in this white man's world, they can't stop us
We've been here all this time
They ain't took us out, they can never take us out
No matter what they say, about us bein' extinct
About us bein' endangered species
We ain't never gon' leave this
We ain't never gon' walk off this planet
Unless y'all choose to
Use your brain, use your brain
It ain't them that's killin' us, it's us that's killin' us
It ain't them that's knockin' us off
It's us that's knockin' us off
I'm tellin' you better watch it, or be a victim
Be a victim, in this white man's world
Born black, in this white man's world, no doubt
And it's dedicated to my motherfuckin' teachers
Mutulu Shakur, Geronimo Pratt, Mumia Abu Jamal
Sekou Odinga, all the real OG's, we out

""The seal, and the constitution, reflect the thinking of the founding fathers, that this was to be a nation by white people; and for white people, Native Americans, Blacks, and all other non-white people were to be the burden bearers, for the real citizens of this nation.""",https://genius.com/2pac-white-manz-world-lyrics

U Can be Touched (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,1996,"You can be touched
You can be touched

Oh God, forgive me, mother, please say a prayer for me
Needed a father, but he was never there for me
Believin' everything they feed me, I'm seein' demons
I wake up screamin', who'd believe me or was I dreamin'?
Five fingers on the 45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infrared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, want to see what's after this
I'm livin' blind writin' rhymes 'til they capture this
If I die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes, hate to see a black man cry
They picture me inside a casket that's how they see us
Oh God, forgive us ghetto bastards, we human beings
Seein' us inside this hell-hole
Just waitin' to fail, so they tell us that's what jail is for
Adolescent young dream's turned violent
Explodin' in a world turned silent
'Cause you could be touched

Bouncin' up in yo' plush spot watchin' David Letterman
Chillin', clearly made it and it's clearly stated
By that 30 yard pool the 5 car's the women and the jewels
Richness, oozes out yo' paw's
But only you and God knows the evil you did to get yours
Crossed ever nigga that ever trusted you
Just a scared nigga afraid one day they might bust at you
Look at you done came so far but did to much
And got to a point in the game where ya ass is stuck
Touched you because the Don gave the word too
He was gonna ran unprepared and got laced on and got murdered

Now I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real niggas that ever breathed
Initiated as an Outlaw back in '94
Snuck in the jaw and ever since I wanted more
Older niggas givin' me the game
Nobody's has touch me on everybody's game
I put my cards on the table
And look through them carefully patiently
While everybody's racin', stay aware 'cause everyday there's another nigga dead
And this should tell you somethin'
Knowin' everybody dies (Yeah), sometimes it's just for nothin'
I know that I could be got but should they shoot me I'm shot
Touched me, trust me my nuts mean a lot

How you gonna live a life when you can't see in front of you?
I know and still know shorty hard, I'm one of you
Thinkin' that it just can't happen this quick
'Cause you run in the town and put that shit on a brick
Now don't nobody know you but the cops and robbers
Leavin' school with problem's, tryna blame it on our father
But his place that you livin' in shit
Straight knowin' that's the place you gonna die
Probably why you ain't givin' a shit

While addicted
Livin' my life lost and wicked
Nigga forget it
'Cause all that clownin' won't prevent this gat from blowin'
Me and my Outlawz we roam
Should have thought before you crossed now my big homies knowin'
And that's the wrongest of wrong
With the strength of the strong
Fuck around with Napo' should have moved out ya' home
'Cause nigga I'm knowin'
Who you fuckin' where you goin'
And the way you make your money now your weakness is showin'
Brother drowned in this world give a damn who she loved
That her father won't be here long enough to see how ya' grown
He got touched

Slippin’ into Darkness,UnKnown,1996,"Yeah! ha ha yeah.... thats right!
The F.A's comin striaght from the wild wild west
Look at baby girl born in 19-7-deuce
Pop's on his fix, Mom's stuck on that crazy juice
Went to school, It's all cool but in Junior Hiiigh
Little hooker in the bathroom getting hiiigh
What she doing and what she smoking, nobody knows
Is she addicted or just slipping into melbose
A bad ass broad running with the girl gang
Just got some tat's,Talking all that girl slang
First one to slap, because La vida dont matter
Wip out a cuete watch your brains get splattered
Selling them doves, hanging with thugs and all that
Beating up fools with a baseball bat
Started having sex at only 14
Imagine O.G. wears his clothes all crisp and clean
Got pregnant had a baby in December
She won't see the daddy till next September
Mom's and Pop's gave her the boot
Kicked her out La Casa, Now what Raza
With the money she got, She bought a spot of the block
Started paying the rent by slangin' phat ass coca rocks
Now shes 23 her four kids all alone, and loc'ed out
And plus shes all smoked out,the base face
You could see it in her eyes, it could also tell the tears
Of a life long cries
They was headed for self destruction
Conjunction Junction,(hey Yo!) Whats your Function?
Her own kids gotta healp, 'cause they knew she was slippin'
Took the devil away homegiiirl, You was Slippin'
CHORUS:
Slipping into Darkness
When you slip you trip and fall
Slipping into Darkness
Ain't no sense to give ya'll no love at all
They say we're slipping, as a whole one race
So, what we gonna choose, Don't want the blues
I turn to the news and what do I see
(merciless)""Everybody in the world ready to D. I. E.""
We got blacks against blacks, browns against browns
Whites against whites,from governments to undergrounds
So, Peep the sound as it bumps through your stereo
Ear to your brain now check out the scenerio
Cali got quakes, Mudslides, and Floods
Pesadillas(nightmares)Crips and Bloods
Hustlas, Pimps, Shot Callers, and Killas
O.G. , Macks, and the big Coca Dealers
We got homeboys who just like kicking it
And Vato's like me who grab the mic and start splitting it
(merciless) ""You're in for a phat treat trip into a phat beat""
So get closer to the funk and slip into the backseat
CHORUS X2
They wanna band me cause a brothas makin noise a lot
Ill shoot they ass in a sec wit a poisin dart
They got me runnin down the street gettin hotter
Runnin from the cops as i try to clock my Glock
The war won't stop
Thats why they wanna band the music
You ever notcie how the cops can't stand the music
See a black man coolin wit a mexican
We can all have peace, the sun sets again
They try to shove us in the pen
But we clown and we frown every time we hit the top ten
Once again, its your friend outta oakland,hopin
To keep the hip hop clubs open
Now we can lay back and let them close'm
Or we can have beef and show that we control'em
Now ain't nobody gettin paid, its a damn shame
Why gang bang brothas in the same gang?
They say securitys to blame, cause they lettin it off
Brothas come to have fun but they settin it off
One time, make it worse when they sweat us
Send an army of pigs to come get us
Now im runnin outta time and im cool down with the aztecs
This is sorta like soul food",https://genius.com/2pac-slippin-into-darkness-lyrics

The greatest ode to phone sex ever written read more »
What's your phone number?

Now, I could make miracles to tempos
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos; that's the intro
Shook when you rush me, walked up and touched me
Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Just ‘cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips
Shake your hips, goddamn, I love that shit
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on; still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
She's personally blessed from the gods
If I seen her right now, she could get me hard
Didn't want to talk to me 'til she see my car
Never had sex with a rich rap star
'Til I got her in the back of my homeboy's car
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
What's your phone number?
Are you alone? Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!
Time for your girlfriend to take you home
I had fun, but baby, gotta leave me alone
Picture in my rhyme
Take time to rewind these words I say
If you open your mind bet in a minute you'll find
It's time let the Outlawz play
What's ya phone number?

If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?

Troublesome 21,Def Jam’s How to Be a Player Soundtrack ,1997,"Born to wreck shit, poppin' bubble gum
Others call me Yum, but momma call me troublesome
Learned to shoot a gun, before I learned to read or write
Never touched a pipe, made my money every night
'Til I gotta (ride), a motherfuckin' Benz (benz)
Bitch talked to every snitch, they jeopardized me gettin' rich
Only fifteen at a spot full of rock teens
Full of hard knocks, ready to clock, fuck the cops (yeah!)
And we was fat like Trump
Every nigga packed a pump, so time to be poppin' trunks
I stood at the top of the organization
Ready to pop a cop with no hesitations (fuck the police) yeah
Now I'm makin' all the others run
Cause here it comes, look out for brother troublesome

Yeah y'all, hehe
A nigga named Troublesome

I learned from my mistakes I'm twenty-one now
I gotta pack of jackers out for me they hold a gun battle
Ain't old enough to save but I behave just like a true vet
That's cause for all the dirt I did and dirt I didn't do yet
Tryin' to pop my pistol for a profit
Copper tried to stop I didn't drop and so we got it (yeah)
And I don't give a fuck about it
(Aiyyo you think you'll ever quit this shit?) I doubt it
So why not take all of me
Cause I just love to be the nigga that nobody else has the balls to be
These suckers always searchin' for me, with funk
They in a hurry to get buried with they loc's up (see ya)
And once I let my gun pop
Another motherfucker drops
I smoke a gang of buddha better yet some indo
Crack through your window, nigga where the fuck the ya-yo?
You tried to hesitate I couldn't wait to rush him
I didn't trust him, he sneezed and I had to bust him
I'm criminal I'm workin' doin' wicked shit
So catch a Christmas cause I'm murderin' your witnesses, I'm troublesome

Yeah!
Yeah, a nigga named Troublesome

Now I'm on top got plenty dope in
I ain't no fuckin' joke so you can label me King of Oakland, huh
As I sit back and rake my, dough in
I let my money grown in just got rich off what they owin', huh
And pimpin' hoes, there's no open
Keepin' a sister broke I'd rather take it from the token (give it up)
A psychopath when provoked then
All you see is smoke I pull a pistol from my, coat
I told you we ain't havin' it (c'mere)
Give up the dough, reached for his coat, started grabbin' it
Bang bang! Was the sound as I jetted
A bullet in the head so the sucker don't forget it
But I knew that I'd be dead soon
Crime in my head, makin' decisions in my bedroom
I see task at my front do' (ahh shit)
But I ain't goin' alive, so what the fuck these niggas come fo'
Just because you got a vest don't mean you escape from death (bitch)
I put this AK to your chest it'll take your entire breath
Threw a grenade in the front yard
Six cops lunged then got crunched, here they come God
The other cops are closin' in
Deja vu, what do I do, here we go again (here we go again)
I'd rather take my life than have these suckers clown me
When they found me, they call me troublesome

Probation, violation, incarceration, frustration, you know
Fuck that, nigga, damn near about to start basin'
It's hard, hard on a nigga (*coughing*)
Hard on a nigga (""Yeah, it is. Yeah, it is."")

Feel me

Travel through my mind, am I blind it's a shame
Young niggas gettin' murdered straight took out the game
As I sit here puffin' on a cigarette
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin' on a niggas death
These are the rough times, best to hurry up
And duck muh'fucker 'fore I buck mine
It's gettin' crazy and everybody's strapped
Surrounded by niggas but nary a motherfucker down to watch my back
These are the bitch made niggas, you been played, nigga
While you starvin' and broke they pullin' six figures
Oooh, what can you do?
When you can't trust your crew
Time to bust out the twenty-two
Boo-yaow!
Ran out of weed, so I'm sippin' on this Hennessy
Tell me, do you feel me?
Hey, I have no remorse
As I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh

Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G

Thuggin' to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
I'm the first muh'fucker that can outrun a bullet
It's them Thug Life niggas and we don't like tricks
Got these punk wannabes and they jockin' like bitches
Now my riches is gettin' hoes on it's own
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone
I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin' that spinach
And stayin' strong to the finish and then I ride out
See you on the freeway, sorry baby
But I gotta call my homie, see what he say
I ain't got no time, I gotta get mine
I keep my mind on my loot, I'll shoot every time
And ain't no way I'ma let bitch made nigga worry me
Catch me slippin', empty the clip and bury me
Hell nah, nigga, have to plug me twice
Ain't no slippin' when you thug for life
Motherfucker, can you see?

Tell me do you see

Never bow down let these other bitches crawl
I'm a thug motherfucker and these thugs only ball
Ain't no half steppin' here, from the cradle to the grave
I'm a muh'fuckin' fool, but I choose to get paid
Now my pockets gettin' empty, and I'm panicked in a fright
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin' tonight
Ain't nobody livin' safe, got a plot and I'm stressin'
All I want is my muh'fuckin' money, ain't no question
Don't try to stall, little trick, cause we hit
So bring in the scissors and get to clippin' at his dick
I'd rather die young than die old and broke
That's why I stay drunk, and I constantly smoke
My memories as a youngsta, hangin' with the homies
But now I'm doin' bad and them bitches don't know me (""Who? Who?"")
But playa haters can't fade me (""Why?"")

Yeah, constantly runnin' from danger ain't no stranger to cop cars
Gettin' arrested and tested wearin' a vest and don't drop my guards
My life is hectic my homies send mail from jail
Niggas in hell got some horrible stories to tell
I'm catchin' cases and still tryin' to stack a grip
The IRS is tryin' to stress off a nigga's shit
A young nigga never had a prayer to prevail
And all my peers doin' years locked up in jail
What can I do, stay strapped, get a bigger crew
And creep around with them Dogg Pound niggas, too
And now we rich ain't no bitch that can touch us
And it's a trip, how we clown, when we fuck sluts
Bust nuts then I cut, that's my new thang
And motherfuckers got on do-rags

Can I get paid, can I get paid, can I motherfuckin' get paid
Nigga can work for his money all motherfuckin' day and still never see a piece of it, you understand me?
It's not about the nice guy
It's about the hardworkin' motherfuckin' thug nigga
If you ain't a thug, nigga, you ain't really doin' nothin'
You ain't really makin' nothin'
These motherfuckin' po-po's and these pink folks got it all locked up for us to fail
See how they did O.J., and they doin' niggas like that all day

Lost Souls,Gang Related - The Soundtrack ,1997,"'Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time (lost soul)
How it start, how it start?

Started off with runnin' from coppers
Duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF state Feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us, wasn't bitter or sweet
See, if a nigga don't hustle, then the nigga don't eat
On these streets, livin' do or die, circle complete
Repetitive motions of felons in a rush for G's
Please understand my history, a man of many hats
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, in the cracks, but blind
Even though we have hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Stranded in the County in the worst way
Hell of a way to spend my 21 birthday
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
It's for the neighborhood and weed spots that we love
Lost souls… 
lost souls, nigga
For my homeboys that passed on
Words from the mind of a lost soul
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time

My brother Sean, first on my list, he stuck with a three-five
When he get out, would I be dead or alive?
He taught me the rules so much, 
but still In Thugs I Trust
When in danger never hesitate to keep my fuckin' trap shut
My mom dukes got a little bit of thug in her
The devil loves sinners: crackheads and drug dealers
Sometimes I feel like the streets 
are
 takin' over
Never stayin' sober, the brain over and over
Backtrack, my stack's fat, I used to take new
One love to my crew, ayo, this one's for you

R.I.P. … rest in peace to Mu grandmother
Know what we gotta do, baby, one-time

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time!
One-time! One-time! One-time!

I was born 22 years ago yesterday
But see, I saw no reason for me to celebrate
Let me demonstrate
Entered the world from out a poisonous womb
Heroin bein' consumed, already predictin' my doom
Soon to be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done, tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin' the time of day
Crime for pay, I'm on my way
But don't know where I'ma end up
I swear to God, it's just a set-up
And these are the words from the mind of a lost soul

Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
‘Cause I hate to spend my life
My life, my life, my life duckin' one-time

All of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself

Never Had A Friend Like Me,Gridlock’d (The Soundtrack),1997,"Never!

You ain't never had a friend like me!
Believe that!
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me!

See, at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail
Sending me mail
Heard the block's in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed
Niggas slanging at the same place
The same faces
Suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears
, just got life plus
And you wonder if these white judges like us
Just stay strong, we'll appeal, nigga, you'll be free
Down with ya to the very end
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me

How can I be blamed? Forgive me, Lord, I'm insane
In search of fame, won't hurt to change
Following the foot steps of past dealers
Equipped with Ski masks, no witnesses as we blast squealers
And now they feel us 
in this act of war
More casualties, no survivors
Any man that defies, quickly dies 'cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests, equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
'Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
They never wanted us to make it
Everything that we possess
We had to fight and take it
I think the president is smokin' weed, bumpin' this beat
Makin' a livin' out of my misery
'Til he got a friend like me

I'm down for you so ride with me

Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was younger
I could picture livin'
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die, nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties, why the fuck should I let you live
When I'm dead inside?
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at they whole crew
Nigga, remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin'
It's visitin' day at San Quinton
Always there to see your closest roaddog

Real Bad Boyz (Westside)/Mind Of A Bad Boy,Hitworks,1997,"What goes on in the mind of a bad boy? Nothin' but payback
Who's next, the clip, callin' murder conducting the contract
Better watch your back
Since he's makin' that comeback
The 1-87 will stop 'em
The hollow point, will drop ya
Go on, here's a scene for your soul
So take heed when you meet face-to-face, here comes the grim reaper
You best to profit from the depths of hell
He's a real McCoy
But ain't no stoppin' this girl is bad boy
He ain't no joke
Muthafucka grab your throat
Before you find yourself cut with a blade
As your bloody body lays on top of cement
In front of your president
It was a murder for hire
Hit an innocent child in the crossfire
Now he's confined to a jail
Got shot six times, in his spine
But his mind is still down at the grind
He's willin' to destroy
That's what he lives for, to be a bad boy

Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? We're comin' after you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you

I got these bustas on my block and they after me
Runnin' 'round tellin' these niggas, how they gon' capture me
It's gettin' crazy, it's hard to make my mind up
Now should I, buck 'em down, or put my nine up?
You see, I ain't a bad boy, just a boy who had it bad
I graduated from 22's to 3-57 mags
Runnin' on these marks 'fore they stashin'
I ain't askin', give it up, or get to blastin'
The penitentiary don't scare me
A straight thug nigga, the whole set'll take care of me
And tell me, who the fuck you gon' find
Rough enough to tear these bitch-niggas, this is mine
Now busta, meet my nine, 24 on the grind
I'm sick about mine, and uh, ain't nothin' wrong with gettin' high
A hustlin'-ass nigga from the projects, I'm makin' loot
And screamin' Thug Life, nigga, when I shoot
They made me

Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? We're comin' after you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you

Now how many bad boys in the house
So hurry boys got the bigger nuts
What the fuck, I gave 'em the blunts
Havin' a grudge against the whole fuckin' world
A 16 shot-block-Glock, that'll stop 'em
They're sure to hit the ground
Nothin', bustin' a cap on no more every round
A bad boy is the big, shot on the block
He got knots, bigger rocks for the cops
Before he gets props
So you petty boys, you can't fuck with 'em
You can eat the biggest good friend
Or become a victim of a dead man
It's sad to see, when you end up six-feet deep
So rest in peace, muthafucka, join the pow
He got nothin' but the realest style
Flavors when on the mic
And packin' the meal like life
Savers, sweep up on you at night
His grip on tight, and make you take a bite
That's all she wrote, barrel went down your throat
Killin' off these niggas for fun
Murder one, and throw away your gun
He's livin' his life like a soldier
That's what he lives for, to be a Bad Boy

Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we comin' at you
Bad boy, bad boy, what you gonna do?
What you gonna do? Watch out, we're comin' after you",https://genius.com/2pac-real-bad-boyz-westside-mind-of-a-bad-boy-lyrics

Picturin' pistols, spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false, sittin' in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they're petrified bitches
I'm tryna be strong, they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron, the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed, my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned, word is bond you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani, he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life, nigga we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at ya door with .44s

Hahahahaha, yeah nigga
Thug Life, the waterbed, deadly combination boy
Get up outta here before you get your fuckin' head shot off
Or your ass peeled back, This how we do it out here on this underground
Real shit nigga
Watch out nigga this is '95

You know what I'm sayin' outta court, Fuck what you thought
Better stop thinkin' these niggas is fan

Keith Murray is comin' from the North Side, leavin' everything left as it's guessed
With every breath past proceed the word to death
This is a Keith Murray type of D-Day, so melee
Cause I got more skills than a sen-say
Searchin' for the bottom my flow, you're vanished
My style is still the flyest most transparent
On this motherfuckin' planet
I wish a nigga would try to take it for granted
I'm mad as fuck and my lifestyle is shady
So hey yo Big Lyte, best of three 80's
You see me, you see the L.O.D
Purposely psycho, so magically
M.V.P. of the M.I.C. Rap industry

For niggas tryna false alarm uh
Feel the steel in ya face as I raise the base
And the pace, in ya face
Punk ass bitches know what time it is with N.Y.C
Niggas go purely crazy
Bitch ass niggas get blasted, one, blah, catch it son
Motherfuckers know directly where I'm from
I'm dead serious from Long Island, represent the East Coast
Nigga you get burnt like toast
Cause I don't give a fuck, who don't give a fuck?
We don't give a fuck, you don't give a fuck
So go buck buck buck buck
And duck like a chicken when I'm comin' through, bakin' you
Motherfuckers know my time and they know my name
And my crew, L.O.D, strictly whilin', for D
U.S.A., you see
Keith Murray, comin' through in the fly shit
Fuck around kid, you get your wig split
I don't have it, Ron G don't have it

Then we picked up nines
And after that I had gotten into a life of crime
Gettin' mine stickin' laws killin' niggas in the mix
I couldn't give a fuck (It's Alive!) I was never turn to tricks
To stay up with my set game, bangin' when I have to
Never ever fail and always down to bust the caps too
At you, and that's how it went to pay the rent
And up in Cali motherfuckers know I'm gettin' paper
And now it's gettin' harder one times is on my tail
I Judge in New York cause I don't wanna go to jail
I'm lightin' up with my nigga Ron G
It's the Waterbed mad, nigga can't you see?
Nothing but the motherfuckin' bass in your face
No more crime I'm doin' rhyme, and gettin' mine up in the place

Raise Up Off These (Nuts),Oakland Soul (The Bay Area Soundtrack) ,1997,"Raise up off these nuts, a little bit
Just a little bit
Raise up off these nuts, a little bit

I'm smokin these niggas like they endo
Breakin em like they windows
And still they rip till they get a whiff
Of this shit that I kick
And if they ever had a notion to stop me
Treat your best shot and get dropped
With your posse, nigga I got the ?mott?
I'm takin em out, a lot I got
More than you could pop
I'm rockin the spot, so now they jock
Dump em and get dropped
2Pac ain't tryin to hear it, Ox
Screamin at your box
I'm swearin at ya not so uh
Static is the last thing you need when you see me
Better have a bat or a gat to defeat me
Nigga, I'm a whole posse rolled into one shot
Takin on your gat while your girl gets hot and rocks the spot
Fear funky flavor with the gift that only God gave
Hold it to my grave
I'd rather die than be a slave
Slaves come as dope dealers
Some come as addicts
Some come to run while the others cause static


I'm comin up outta the cut
Sendin slugs to the guts
I'm bustin up outta the page cuz they got me locked up
I'm tryin to survive but there's too many playa hatin haters
Always want static, like boom holla at ya later
Homie this ain't no love in this town that I come from
Niggas be wantin funkin then I stomp em, they don't want none
Girls be on my jock and they playin me for that
But fool I can't help it cuz I was raised up like a mack
Jealous because I'm black, Jack wanna jack me
And Jill wants to marry me and watch the Klan bury me
Got to pack the steel for the personal protection
AK, 45's, assault rifles, Smith & Wesson
I'm no longer stressin
Learnin, gotta live long
(..?..) thanks God that I'm still strong
Get a bag a spliffs for the homies, blaze up all of these
But if you wanna flex, get in my Kool Aid punks, raise up offa
These


Just back the fuck up of me, cuz you can't get none a these
It's that OG female comin straight up out the PP's
So step to the side then raise the fuck up off me, brah
Cuz if I take it to that level I'ma light this motherfucker up
Now it's on you, you better try to lose your shit
Cuz if you don't, trust me I got you trick
You better try to choose it and lose it
Stay outta mine 'fore this shit get way stupid
These niggas I fuck with believe in passin gats
Can't leave hoe, without my strap
Not givin a fuck about nothin
Slidin through the spot with my face mask muggin
Lookin motherfuckers up and down
It ain't a future in your frontin
Why these fat niggas floatin around?
What happened to them real motherfuckin G's?
Fake motherfuckers need to raise up offa these

16 on Death Row,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Death Row
That's where mothafuckas is endin' up

Dear Mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me or will this nigga snitch?
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn, they got me trapped
Hawkin' while I'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
‘Cause life's a Wheel of Fortune, here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin' trigger-happy to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash
Whip out the 9, now imma dime off yo' ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin', but swear I'm nothin' nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mites
I listened to his screams until he went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little bird? He snitched and told a friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old-timers
And fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

Dear Mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime ‘cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt when you're black
And you're trapped in a living hell
I shouldn't have let him catch me
Instead of livin' sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm
You can hear his asshole gettin' torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold and your soul is your best friend
My mama, pray for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me
(Why?) ‘Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope; 16 on Death Row

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row

Dear Mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter ‘cause I'm dyin', so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society
That doesn't give a shit and they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that mothafucka never cared for me
He's only here to be sure I don't drop a dime to God
About the crimes he's committin' on the poor
And how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers, and in all these years they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin' mothafuckas
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
‘Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
I'm convinced, self-defense is the way
Please stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go

Do for Love,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave—oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Niggas wanna see me buried
Worried, if you comin' hurried

From off the block, no longer rock
And puttin' money in my pocket, nationwide baller

I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the Lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thuggin'
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free

And all about my dollars make me wanna holla
Drop an album, sell a million, give a fuck about tomorrow

Keep on huffin' and puffin', ain't no fear in my heart
What's goin' on in the ghetto? Still struggle and strive

Went from a bucket to a rag with switches
I'm seein' death around the corner
I'm bumpin' ""Gloriaaaa,"" doin' 90 ‘cause I wanna
I'm gettin' high, and like I said, it was some chocolate thai
Mixed with some Indonesia, watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me
Hit the weed and I continue doin' 90
Until I get caught, another ticket get to kick it in court
Fuck the law, give a shit, I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
But I ain't worried, still throwin' these thangs
Got me locked in these chains
And hey, nigga, what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout?
Soon as I hit the cell, I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets, I'm in a rush to ball
I'm screamin' ""Thug Life!"", nigga, fuck y'all!

""I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends
I thought I had friends, but I ain't got no fuckin' friends""

That’s right fuck all y'all man
Fuck all y’all
That is right, I don’t need nobody
Fuck all y’all
Fuck all the hard copies daily news
Fuck the bitches, the tele news, New York Posts, all those motherfuckers

Hellrazor,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Major! Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellraiser

Born thuggin'
Heartless and mean, muggin' at sixteen
On the scene watchin' fiends buggin'
Kickin' up dust with the older G's
Soakin' up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
I learned not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes
Taught lessons, a young nigga askin' questions
While other suckers was guessin', I was gangsta sexin'
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing
I'm buckin' blastin', straight mashin'
Mobbin through the overpass laughin'
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? I keep my finger on the trigger
'Cause some nigga tried to kill me
And mama raised a hellraiser, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin'
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark 'til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin' richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin' trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein' black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin' major, unhh

Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major

Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major
Lord be my savior, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser
Stress gettin' major, unnh
Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major

Dear Lord can ya feel me

Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin'
Mama raised a hellraiser, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin' to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies rushin' into early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin' else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
Crooked cop killin' Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin' but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggas burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin' triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin' better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin' blunts
Gettin' drunk off that Tanqueray gin
'Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin' pen'
Mama raised a hellraiser, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellraiser
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin' major

Mama raised a hellraiser, stress gettin' major

Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin' to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin' please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin' die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, aww shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin' high 'til they bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news how she bucked the girl, killed Latasha
Now I'm screamin' fuck the world,
 in the end
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker, I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
With my hands on the trigger, thug nigga
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die",https://genius.com/2pac-hellrazor-lyrics
Hold on Be Strong,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Hold on... *lighter flicks up*
Yeah, it's gonna be alright
Don't trip, baby *inhales*
It'll get better... *coughing*
Aye, do this thug style, man, thug style
When this whole beat drop
We just gon' run it to 'em
Bet, it's all good, uhh

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And drive-by's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had pain in my heart
I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone, it wasn't healthy
I traveled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain, but I'm still here
Never did like the police
Let the whole world know, now I gets no peace
‘Cause they chasin' me down
And facin' me now, what do I do?
These things that a thug goes through
And still I rise, so keep your head up
And make your mind strong
It's a struggle every day, but you gotta hold on

Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
When it's on, it's on

There's never a good day, ‘cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' before they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you Blood or you Cuz?
Remember how it was?
The picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin', gettin' high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky
And be strong, most of all, hold on

Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
Hold on, be strong!
When it's on, it's on

(Hold on, be strong *repeats in background*)
I know them ain't tears comin' down your face
Wipe your eyes
In this world, only the strong survive, you know?
Hehe, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, car-jackings
Yeah, we got problems
But believe me when I tell you things always get better
God don't like ugly, and God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said?
Bay-bee, God bless the child that can hold his own
You know? You got to stand strong
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face
Tell 'em ""Hold on!"", and be strong
The game don't stop, huh
This here is black, man
If you don't never learn nothin', learn one thing
It don't stop, 'til the casket drop
Thug for life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad
Especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin', hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic",https://genius.com/2pac-hold-on-be-strong-lyrics
I Wonder If Heaven Got a Ghetto,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I was raised, a little young nigga doin' bad shit
Talk much shit, ‘cause I never had shit
I could remember being whupped in class
And if I didn't pass, Mama whupped my ass
Was it my fault Papa didn't plan it out?
Broke out, left me to be the man of the house
I couldn't take it, had to make a profit
Found a block, got a Glock, and I clock grips
Makin' G's was my mission
Movin' enough of this shit to get my mama out the kitchen
And why must I sock a fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
First you didn't give a fuck, but you're learnin' now
If you don't respect the town then we'll burn you down
Goddamn, it's a motherfuckin' riot
Black people on a rage, police, so don't try it
If you're not from the town then don't pass through
‘Cause some O.G. fools might blast you
It ain't right, but it's long overdue
We can't have peace 'til the niggas get a piece too
I want G's so you label me a criminal
And if I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

Here on Earth, tell me what's a black life worth?
A bottle of juice is no excuse, the truth hurts
And even when you take the shit
Move counties, get a lawyer, you can shake the shit
Ask Rodney, Latasha, and many more
It's been going on for years, there's plenty more
When they ask me, ""When will the violence cease?""
When your troops stop shootin' niggas down in the street
Niggas had enough, time to make a difference
Bear witness, own our own business
Fuck the guard, ‘cause it's hard tryin' to make ends meet
First we couldn't afford shit, now everything's free
So we loot, please don't shoot when you see
I'm takin' from them ‘cause for years they would take from me
Now the tables have turned around
You didn't listen, until the niggas burned it down, huh
And now Bush can't stop the hit
I predicted the shit in 2Pacalypse
And for once I was down with niggas
Felt good in the hood being around the niggas
Yeah, and for the first time everybody let go
And the streets is death row, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Yeah, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it take to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
‘Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we deal is when we kill each other
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And though it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to have a black President
Huh, it ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
I wake up in the mornin' and I ask myself:
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of being poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
Mo' nigga, mo' nigga, mo' niggas
Rather be a dead than a po' nigga
Let the Lord judge the criminals
If I die, I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto

I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
And I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate

Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
That get up every motherfuckin' mornin' and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy

I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggas laughed, 'til the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
And now they coverin' the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin' to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin' ghost on the five-o, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin' out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, 
cook some ya-yo
Holla ""five-o"" when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen', I'm hittin' fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin' me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin' one-fifty-five
In the city where the little niggas die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G

I'm gettin' money (money)

I'm gettin' money (money)
I'm gettin' money (money)

Yeah, get paid nigga
I gotta get 
Get paid bwooy (fuck the police)
Watch out for all this, nigga

Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin'
Kinda boomin' round the way, think today I make a killin'
Dressin' down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
Just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin' from the cops
I'm gettin' high, think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin' it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
Drinkin' liquor and I'm lookin' for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin' money, than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin' paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life
 and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G

I'm gettin' money (money)
I'm gettin' money (money)

Yeah nigga, get paid
Can't fade me boy
To my niggas in Oaktown
Get money
That's right y'all
That's how we run the shit in '93 boy
Fuck them niggas 

Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my 
Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
At point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed
, they shakin' the dice
Now roll 'em if you can't stand pain better hold 'em
Cause ain't no tellin' what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it

They can never take the life of a young G

Here we go

Lord help me, save me, Mama keep prayin'
For a young motherfucker tryin' to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waitin' to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfuckin' thug disease
Cravin' beats like they motherfuckin' drugs to me,
 hey
What's up with bitches tryin' to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my Glock I'm a plottin' ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screamin' Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm goin' crazy, gettin' dizzy

I hang with G's flippin' keys and smokin' weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a ho and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I givin' how I'm livin' what I'm givin' up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most comin' from the west coast
Where the niggas is bangin' 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screamin' inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm goin' crazy shit don't phase me
I'm livin' like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it

Shit was talkin' to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a liar
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to dick me
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm havin' long conversations with Mr. Millimeter
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spittin' motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into takin' over a dope turf and shootin' cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talkin'
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talkin'
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang

Then a trick'll be a trick
I got my nigga Richie Rich and we be all up in the mix
This is Thug Life baby rollin' hoes like Vogues
Stay the fuck up out of mine
And I'll stay out of yours
It's a Oakland thang and bitch you wouldn't understand
This Tanqueray got me screamin', 
Fuck yo' man
But now you beefin' on the strength
That you was thinkin' I was jockin'
Hey bitch I got no time for hoes I'm steady clockin'
And if it ain't about a buck I gives a fuck
It's raggedy hoes like you that keep a nigga stuck
So what's up with them low life bitches tryin' to play me
Bitch you better see Trojan about yo' baby
 (Ha ha)
Trickin' niggas better catch up on they pimpin'
Cause bitches love to catch a nigga when they slippin'

You ain't got to lie to kick it
To them tricks and them bitches
Out to get a nigga's riches
You ain't got to lie to kick it
To them tricks and them bitches

Nothin’ But Love,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin' Hennessy, smokin' weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snupe, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all
Ooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Havin' house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
Straight grindin', everybody havin' fun
And it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool, now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushin' and I'm rushin' to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lyin'
Why? I seen her talkin' to this other guy and
He's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin', I just hope he get 'em, I got nuttin but love

Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours

I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
And pay respect to the place that I came from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin', his breath still stinkin'
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin'
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin' double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin' stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love

Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
I'm down for yours

When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks
And the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope
Started thinkin' bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
'Til the dealer on the block told me, ""That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool""
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tried to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinkin', since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin' like a waste, tears rollin' down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nuttin but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love

Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Yeah, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Yeah, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Uhm, nuttin but love
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya, Yeah!!
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
Ain't got nuttin but love for ya

Nothing to Lose,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
Stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday, but he don't listen
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me?
Wish he would've hugged me
Too much like him, so my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age, I'm getting paid
And I'm strapped, so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray?
I'm hanging in the back streets
Running with G's and dope fiends, will they jack me?
Can't turn back, my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose, everybody gotta die
Say good-bye to the bad guy
That one, you fucked, when you passed by
Buck-buck from a Glock let the glass fly
Do or die walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

With nothing to lose
 I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
 That’s why I got gang-related rhymes
Got nothing to lose
 I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
 That’s why I got gang-related rhymes
(x3)

I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen', here we go again
Ain't nothing separating us from a MAC-10
Born in the ghetto as a hustler, older
Straight soldier, bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
See me striking down the block hitting corners
Mobbing like a motherfucker, living like I wanna
Ain't no stopping at the red lights, I'm sideways
THUG LIFE, motherfucker, crime pays
Let the cops put they lights on, chase me, nigga
Zig-zagging through the freeway, race me, nigga
In a high speed chase with the law
The realest motherfucker that you ever saw
I'm living raw, til they bury me, don't worry me, I'm high
Living like I ain't afraid to die
And if you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too

With nothing to lose
 I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
 That’s why I got gang-related rhymes
Got nothing to lose
 I got raw when I came to Cali
Got nothing to lose
 That’s why I got gang-related rhymes
(x3)

Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
And every day there's a million black bodies put away
I'm starting to lose hope, it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave, 'cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo, creeping out the window
Alone, on my own, I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household
I'm out cold, on the streets screaming 'Motherfuck peace!'
I got nothing to lose, and something to prove, what do I do?
Live the THUG LIFE, nigga, stay true
I wonder when they kill me, is there a heaven for a real G?
Lord forgive me, if you feel me
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke with no hope
Little skinny motherfucker wanting dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade
But everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway, it's so hard on a nigga in this city, no pity
And ain't no love for the scrubs that be buying dime
If you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too


They wonder what type nigga be a THUG LIFE nigga
We be the craziest, motherfucker!
You know!
They wonder what type nigga be a THUG LIFE nigga
We be the craziest!",https://genius.com/2pac-nothing-to-lose-lyrics
Only Fear of Death,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Pssst... psssssst... ayo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever?
Tell me, which one?

They wanna bury me, I'm worried, I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my 9, and my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me, unfortunately, ‘cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin' off marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' asleep while I'm in service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high
Don't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it
Everybody's dyin', am I next? Who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin'?
Two to the head while I'm in bed
Leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
I'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch
The line's busy every time I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later!
To all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her
This bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other
Now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drank a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger, then I dash
Niggas don't like me, ‘cause I'm thuggin'
And every day I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid

They wanna bury me, I'm worried—no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest, I'm losin' homies—ain't that a bitch?
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord, are you there?
Then tell me, am I lost? ‘Cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends, but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run, I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Well, Hell can't be worse than this, ‘cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you, I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin' MAC
-11, ‘cause in Heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin' you now: ''You motherfuckers don't know me''

Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
(I ain't scared to die)
Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas

Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas
Only fear of death is comin' back reincarnated
Only fear of death... you ghetto niggas

Do you wanna live forever?

Open Fire,R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Alright now, here we go

Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me?
I smoke a blunt and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and stayin' high 'til I die, my competition's zero
'Cause I could give a fuck about you, you better duck
Go or I'll be forced to hit yo' ass up, I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why they sweat me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggas know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggas trip and, yo, it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggas get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey!
I'm gettin' sweated by these undercovers
Who can I trust, got my mama stressin', thinkin' it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We livin' a drug life, THUG LIFE, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin' fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggas, I gotta come up
And recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
Over the fence and open fire
Alright now, here we go

These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin' round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin' ninety on the freeway, and hittin' switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin' up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin' outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon' catch a crook? haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin' loogies
At the coppers that pursue me, beotch!
I be a hustler 'til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas
Alright now, here we go

Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin' bills, so I'm transportin' weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin'
Droppin' keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear? I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me runnin' from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin' down a dirt road
But I ain't goin' alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doin' ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin' tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!

R U Still Down? (Remember Me),R U Still Down? (Remember Me),1997,"Are you still down?
Are you still down?
Are you still down?

Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, 'cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin', never heard my friends callin'
Couldn't stop myself from fallin', I'm all in
Shit's gettin' sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
'Cause in my mind, I see sunshine
I thought I didn't have to run
Now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' ""One time!""
Take your time to feel my record
And if you did, chill a second
My blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone
Are you still down?

Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?

I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs
I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his nine
'Cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggas on the streets, man, listen
'Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way, I'm bustin' my ass and gettin' no pay
It seems I can't find my focus and homie, I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, it's hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin', see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but are you still down

Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up ... are you still down?
Raise 'em up—

I wrote this for my critics and my enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, 'cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, ""Baby, it's on!""
And now I'm hustlin' and bustin' them bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin' G's
Buyin' all the things on TV, and gettin' skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin' wild through the town
Please tell me, are you still down?
Are you still down? Raise 'em up. Remember me

There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggas die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Gettin' lost in the madness, blunted gettin' tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin', ""Lord come and get me""
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin' my clip, I'm watchin' every bullet spit when I kick 'em
Niggas die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggas that's caught
Had a motherfuckin' warrant but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon

Committing sins I might die in vain
So fuck it! We'll live off the street fame

Dear mama I know you worry cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin' in Hell
Like I'm walkin' with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much pain in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin' to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin'
Got a nigga losin' hair and they wonder if I'm all there

And fuck that nigga fuck that nigga fuck you too nigga

I'm in this, motherfucker
I guess these muthafuckas tryin' to take me out the business right
I guess I ain't East Coast enough for my niggas back in New York
And I ain't West Coast for these niggas on the West huh?
Fuck e'rybody
*laughing*
Thug style out this, motherfucker, niggas, throw ya hands in the air
If you got jeep make ya speakers pop
I want motherfuckin' police tryin' to pull niggas over on this one
We takin' this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet

Hit me, I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm gettin' high off buddha 'cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
And that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me 'cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat
You can holler if you want to, please!!
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew be, bleed!!
Enemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone
My fuckin' game is strong, now hotline
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
From hustlin' and bustin' them rhymes
To my niggas up in Quentin, down on Rikers Isle
Stay rile, but a nigga gotta use his styles

These, niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
It's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks
And all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
'Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
I cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild
I came up out this dust with my heartless style

These, niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style

I remember Uptown, run catch a kiss
Listenin' to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
And even though I had a habit
Makin' words rhyme I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's with a gift of gab
Tryna hook up with the hookers who was quick to stab
Remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned 'cause she good lookin'
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't payin'
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot 'cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
Had to move to the West to regain my style

These, niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (my nigga scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style (scream)
Niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Crooked smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the mothafuckin' cross, but my force was wild
Mothafuckin' bitches

Swear y'all know a nigga
You ever heard a motherfucka say:
""All in the Kool-Aid, don't know the flavor""? Haha

Aw nigga let me get one of them cigarettes
Here!!, Shit!
Come on bastard, get the phone for a nigga
Use the phone
Aw nigga get the phone for me man
What's the number?
323-65-45, tell her it's 'Pac

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name
, but
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me or them, fuck friends
My foes be on a mission, tryin' to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm out to get out, they all thought
I blow up like a gauge, and in a rage, blow they balls off
Why are you niggas tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
My Main thang with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel
Use the lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin' with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin' again

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

Hey, still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick, call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, 
to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin' me baby, to a young
Motherfucker facin' eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get a hook
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggas that was frontin' while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery
The nigga you don't wanna see

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me

Guess who's back? Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?
Power.. enter my world
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggas
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law? Man, fuck the law!
Niggas must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
The motherfuckin' law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggas run the streets, fuck peace) --] repeat in background
Heyyy niggas, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin' babies, killin' mommas
Killin' kids, puttin' this in they motherfuckin' mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
Before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
*singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here'*
All you niggas out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggas, not the whites, not the enemies
Or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molesters
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?
Rest in peace, to Kato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more

Hail Mary,The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory,1997,"Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body (All through your body)
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty (Uh) feel me!
(Come with me Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now Do you wanna ride or die)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La la-da-la la la la la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La la-da-la la la la la

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, da-da, da, da, da-da, da

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Hell, 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

Come with me!

What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up

If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty

Made Niggaz,The Prophet Returns,1997,"No man separate what we create
Unstoppable, untouchable
Motherfuckin' worldwide mob figures
Death Row at it's finest!
M.O.B., thug for motherfuckin' life
Motherfuckin' made niggas
We comin' after these niggas, worldwide
Feel me! Makaveli the Don

My life in exchange for yours, born hated as a thug
House full of babies cryin' from a lack of gettin' love
Ain't nobody tell me shit, 'til I got a sack of drugs
Had the block sewn up, cause I learned to pack a gun
Do you feel me? World, do you hear me?
Catch a risin' star, fuck the love, niggas fear me
Got these niggas runnin' all wild from my double-R
When we ride, motherfuckers is sure to die
Boom once I enter the room, in the air
All you hear is the whispers of doom, niggas scared
They don't wanna see me head on
Think of all the busters that I had to leave dead and gone
Call a gravedigga, fuckin' with a made nigga
M.O.B, gunfire, gettin' sprayed quicker
Fuck 'em all, let 'em understand my plot to get richer
Much more than six figures, a motherfuckin' made nigga

(Can you feel me?)
A motherfuckin' made nigga
I got a plot to get richer
Take my picture, a made nigga

Nigga, I was raised on the streets, I had to hustle just to eat
My role model was killin' niggas, so I know I would never be weak
They got me sittin' wonderin', where my life begins
These niggas crossed my father, then my father crossed them
'Cause I roll with Immortal Thug niggas
And my number one plan to kill a man
To grab a needle and drug niggas
Niggas don't like us, because they bitches straight love us
The President told us to leave
'Cause the government don't want us
It's Napoleon, I get my pleasure out of sin
And seein' blood spill ain't shit 'cause I seen it at the beginnin'
A made nigga

How many niggas fall in your vision?
Gunnin' 'em down for every last minute that I spent in prison
We mash together, plus we get cash together
Blast whenever, knowin' it don't last forever
It's only one way out and one way in
Motherfuckers cross and get crossed out, never made men
We find excuses to loot, cock, and shoot
Blow the roof off them groups like Rauf al-Mabhouh
I can't be touched, 'cause of the weapons I clutch
And the niggas that I'm under is just too much: we made niggas

Picture the scenery, 'cause for now you gon' have to imagine
Call me your prophet 'cause I predicted what's gon' happen
I began the paper, stackin' at those who be paper snatchin'
Will emerge like crack in the 80's
Fade me? Maybe, that's if I slip
But I became official since the start of this
Edi Amin, born July, 7th, a few shed eyes, precious
But others gave me they hate to cherish
But still I made it, a made nigga made by the game
Made for war, my aim is simple and plain
Yeah, whether it's 'caine, or these tracks made for your brain
You'll forever know my name, Edi, a made nigga

I ain't count the line, my strap, my head
There will be none of that
The young hog, K-Dog playin' Outlaw Immortal combat
With the criminal skill, they cannot beat me a nigga
'Til he still and chill, recognize the real deal
Feel — a nigga made when I was young and dumb
With a gun, but it pays, so I'm bustin' for fun
And the outcome will be the same every time
We all gon' die, get yours 'cause I'ma get mine

Tha Outlawz, we be the Don Juan's of this rough shit
Rhymes baptize your mind while paralyze the public
With my mentality of war
Dead bodies and silence, give it to you raw
Thug nigga to the core
The results of livin' poor, got me thinkin' on a made level
Shootin' my gauge to get paid, a fuckin' crazed devil
Mash shit from here to here, day by day, year to year
Made niggas on your motherfuckin' tear: I'm a made nigga

Call me a Bad Boy killer, murder motherfuckers daily
Know the feds trail me, so my alias Makaveli
Gettin' lessons from niggas in penitentiaries
Game, when applied, help me survive several centuries
Lock me in a cage, I'll display my rage
Surround the court buildin' with the gauge and spray
They wonder if I'll go when I'm finally sentenced
On my knees to God, beggin' for repentance
I'm so convinced that I'm a thug
They got me fiendin' for my cash
Like a fiend when he dreams of drugs
Diss Kidada and I'll kidnap your daughter
Kill your wife and hit the funeral
And tell you just who gave the order
Makaveli the Don 'til I'm gone
I maintain my army of lunatics that stay armed
'Til the day I die, I'll be remembered as a paid nigga
Outlaw to the grave, a motherfuckin' made nigga

Can you feel me? Come closer, ha ha ha
Get into the mind of a made nigga, I can't be touched
My adversaries get fucked, feel me?
Multimillionaire dreams
All I want is the C.R.E.A.M.
I sell my shit to the fiends, all the bitches scream
Come and see, to see a made nigga

Hussein Fatal, Edi Amin, Kastro
Napoleon, Kadafi, Mussolini, M.O.B.

They're with a lot of black women, what should we do, Sarge?
Uhh, I repeat, let 'em go
I repeat, let 'em go
They're made niggas… let 'em go

Starin’ Through My Rear View,The Prophet: The Best of the Works,1997,"Starin' at the world through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'

Multiple gunshots clear the block, the fun stops
Snitches is callin' cops, people shot, nobody stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me, then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed; all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
Listen, through intermissions, search your heart for a plan
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview

They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
Well, let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
While you thinkin' I see you lost up in my rearview
Hear you is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
Starin' at the world through my rearview

Now, I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin' days in this livin' black hell
Do you feel me? Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Niggas hate me in the section, from years of chin-checkin'
Turn to Smith & Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya: talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!

Now I know the answers to the question
“Do dreams come true?”
Still starin' at the world through my rearview
I said, now I know the answer
“Do dreams come true?”
Starin' at the world through my rearview

They got me starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers
Starin' at the world through my rearview
Go on, baby, scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin' fast 'cause it's time to die
Gettin' high, watchin' time fly
And all my motherfuckers

Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Towns run by young guns, Outlawz and truants
Shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or choosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview

Hahahaha, you ain't knowin' what we mean by starin' through the rearview
So, since you ain't knowin' what we mean, let me break it better understandin' the world…The world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played
So, now we lookin' at the world from, high watch, behind us

When I Get Free,Until the End of Time,1997,"Damn, what I'ma do now til when I free.. oh shit!
Wait wait (motherfuck..) get free.. yeah yeah

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street

Them bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin' cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin' to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin' quick as the wind, it's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin' to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up my new range, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggas tryin' to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Main thang with nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it I'll enforce it with the steel
Use the lessons that I learned in jail

Still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash quick
Call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal 'cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
'Cause she keep on callin' me baby
To a young motherfucker facin' eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Now how long will it take, to get her hooked
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin' it to Hell
All them niggas that was frontin' while I sat up in the cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned your misery

When will they let me bail?
Walkin' through the yard, I play the guard
First nigga disrespect me, first nigga gettin' scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hittin' knees in the back of a limousine, puffin' on weed
As we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way, we used to play, you punk hoes
What I possess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggas like bitches when they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin'
As for that bullshit punk, nigga n-now we're even
But I wait, until it's time
And try to find a crooked way to profit off this crime
This life of mine... until I get free

Changes,Greatest Hits,1998,"Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is

(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah-yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)

I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is

(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is

(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is, aww, yeah
Some things'll never change",https://genius.com/2pac-changes-lyrics
God Bless The Dead,Greatest Hits,1998,"Rest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
That's right, bwoy, it's goin' on, right here
Thug Life, God bless the dead

God bless the dead and buried, nigga, don't worry
If you see God first, tell him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you representin' the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers caught up in the whirlwind
The other day I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin' shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin', never meant to do time
My epitaph will read ""was the last of G's""
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead

God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin' to hang
I can see 'em in my head – pow!
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin' back in my yearbook
All the years took half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die, will they all shed tears?
Two to the dome, 
leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoia got me lookin' in the mirror
Behind me, life without my 9, I'd rather do the time
See, I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
 and all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail?
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin'
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin'
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin' at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead

God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
[Interlude: 2Pac +

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin' G's, this one is for you
Yo Stretch, Biggy
Yo Big, this is to you, my nigga
Springfield Hollis Crew
, 
Thug Life
, YG'z
Sendin' they respect, ya know what I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that!

I pray before I go to sleep, ""Dear God!""
Say my grace before I start to eat, 'cause times is hard
So I'm droppin' to my knees, ""Oh why!""
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, Uzi weighin' a ton
Niggas terrified of drama from the young gun
Hearin' that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind-blowin' so I'm flowin' goin' crazy
Slipped, forgot the gun, but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
But spunk is what he had, kid, I'd rather attack Big
Now you 'bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckas wanna test, I'm tellin' you, yes
The teflon's 'bout to rip through your fuckin' vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggy Smallz and the thuggin' clique, yeah

Troublesome ’96,Greatest Hits,1998,"Troublesome, nigga
Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
(Westside!) Let it be known, nigga!
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli

Menacin' methods, label me a lethal weapon
Makin' niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan?
To be the man in this wicked land, underhanded hits are planned
These scams are plotted over grams and rocks
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes!
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Got me a dog and named her ""my bitch nigga eater""
What could they do to me, you lil' brat?
Shit, them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
How can I show you how I feel inside?
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
‘Cause they fear me in the physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

Troublesome nigga, Outlawz
Put it down to the fullest
Spittin' rhymes and bullets, ha ha
We troublesome
Y'all know what time it is
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troubleshit

Gutter ways, my mentality is ghetto
We guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor, bet I bomb on 'em first
Niggas knew we came for murder, pullin' up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry, bustin' off freely
Screamin', ""Fuck all y'all niggas!"" in Swahili
Pistol packin', fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to the care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on yo' ass, like an avalanche
A sole survivor, learned to get high and pull drive-bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin', ""please""
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin' this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died
‘Cause I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

Young, strapped, and I don't give a fuck
I'm hopeless
I live the Thug Life, losin' my focus, ba-baby
I'm troublesome, ha ha
Bad Boy killa, there is no one realer
What you saw
Was the rough, rugged and raw: Outlaw!

""Murder, murder, my mind state,"" shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme; the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost they mind
Like 25 to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen ‘cause he yearned to bang
Sent a lot of flowers, but how could I cry?
Tried to warn the little nigga, ""Either stop or die.""
Mercy is for the weak, when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep, I'm havin' crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies, family times
God forgive me ‘cause it's wrong, but I plan to die
Either take me in Heaven and understand I was a G
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to Hell, ‘cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothin' worse than this cursed-ass hopeless life
I'm troublesome

La la la la, la, la
La, la-la la, lahhh
Bye bye, bye bye
All you niggas die

In your wildest dreams you couldn't picture a nigga like me
Hahahaha – I'm troublesome, I don't give a fuck
I'm troublesome… like my nigga Napoleon said, nigga
Somebody gotta explain why I ain't got shit
Ha ha, I'm troublesome
You know what time it is, the Outlaw clique
Young, rugged and sick
Makaveli the Don, the Boss of all bosses
Mussolini, E.D.I. Mean, Hussein Fatal
Kadafi, Kastro, Napoleon, Bo-Nitty
Haha, we ain't fuckin' around
Haha, we troublesome
Ayo, ha ha, we troublesome, I ain't goin', HA HAH
Young Kastro, the first to blast, the last one to dash
Goin' for the hoes and the cash
Fuck you niggas! Outlawz! Ha hah!
Kadafi – trump tight, never sloppy
Them motherfuckers try to copy
But they can't mock you, nigga, you're too strong
Outlawz keep it goin' on, you know whassup
Outlawz, Outlawz, all you niggas die
Outlawz, Outlawz
This is dedicated to the real niggas
All the real troublesome soldiers on the streets

Unconditional Love,Greatest Hits,1998,"(What y'all want?)
Unconditional love (no doubt)
Talkin' about the stuff that don't wear off, it don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days, these crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
A motherfucker still love you, still feel you
Still there for you, no matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart with unconditional love

Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doin' years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live this life without God?
So we must ask forgiveness
Ask Mama why I got this urge to die
Witness the tears fallin' free from 
my
 eyes before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it, a player in this game
Mama, don't cry, long as we try maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don’t need no welfare and share with our 
whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it, the fightin' and the hurtin'
In my room cryin' because I didn't wanna be a burden
Watch Mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried 'bout a damn thing, with unconditional love

In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

Just got the message, you've been callin' all week
Been out here hustlin' on these streets
Ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's all G
We could never be enemies
'Cause you've been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs?
No wonder why when times get hard
'Cause it ain't easy bein' who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make G's eternally
And my mission is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation, if I could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to plan, strategize, my family's gotta eat
We work somethin' out of nothin'
No pleasure in the sufferin'
Neighborhood would be good if they could cut out all the bustin'
The liquor and the weed, the cussin'
Sendin' love out to my block
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)

In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love

I'll probably never understand your ways
With everyday I swear I hear you tryin' to change your ways
While gettin' paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Somethin' inside, please let me die, these are strange times
How come I never made it?
Maybe it's the way I played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes, so many vivid pictures
And all the currency I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters, 'cause after all the lights and screams nothin' but my dreams matter
Hopin' for better days, maybe a peaceful night
Baby, don't cry, 'cause everything gon' be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry 'bout a thing, baby girl, I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that unconditional love
 (repeat to fade)
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
In this game, the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love",https://genius.com/2pac-unconditional-love-lyrics

Let's bring it to these niggas with some love
Let's show niggas we understand what they goin' through
We know that it's hell 4 a hustla out here
With 3 strikes and jail and penitentiaries and police
And task force, and snitches and bitches and niggas
And playa haters, sit the fuck down
Naw mean
We got to build on this shit
I got some real shit
To hit your ass
Let's spread love nigga
Death Row done made a few fuckin' changes
This is how we do this shit
It's hell 4 a hustla
Makaveli the Don with the Outlawz
Throw your muthafuckin' guns in the air
If you're truly livin' this criminal lifestyle
All my Outlawz, to all you bitch made niggas
Get on your knees nigga, aiite, get on your knees and pray

Oh Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta
Makin' hell for a hustler

I'm makin' money moves mandatory
End of discussion my past records tell a story (check my shit)
Picture niggas we rushin' and still bustin'
'Til the cops come runnin', duck in abandoned buildings (five O)
Ditchin' my gun, oh what a muthafuckin' feelin' (I notice you notice)
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, (thug life baby)
But now legitly
So I laugh 'til I'm cryin', when the law come get me (hahaha)
No baby momma drama, nigga miss me, (biatch)
Why plant seeds in a dirty bitch, waitin' to trick me
Not the life for me
Livin' carefree, 'til I'm buried - and if they dare me
I'm bustin' on the niggas and will they scurry?, (buck buck buck)
I'm clearly a man of military means to my artillery
(Outlaw)
Watchin' over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin' dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin' if this game'll last, feelin' the shame
Cocaine the product of the devil, (fuck that) am I sellin' my soul?
Got tired of small time livin', niggas tellin' me no
I got mine!, fuck them other sucker!, that's the mentality
Jealous-ass bustaz, make it hell for a hustler

While so many real G's they die secret
But Outlawz, we ride so righteously
Control the destiny, we mobbin' with a sight
To see, all together, never separately

It's it a criminal hobby
That got me here thinkin' robbery
Call Oz up the ave uptown back in Cabust
And not a lot of poverty, whether you white like dark
Or brown like Bobby, while dime bitches give me body 'til
They open

Now that's the good of all evil, so tell me what's the worse
Me deep in my hearse, stuck in crime like time fly over here
First, waitin' for credit, contemplatin' my fate
And is the Lord comin', to take me on Judgement Day

They got the fiends usin' up beans with dirty blood on a needle
Stranded, blunted in his van, don't give a damn if you see 'em
Get him branded
Most likely I'm a real nigga, so while the 2 Loc
Five shots will leave y'all to live or die

Well I been hustlin' off the same block since a little shorty wap
Taped up notts so my sock, duckin' the muthafuckin' cops
Watch me shop up, and locked up, come back and blow the block up

Preoccupied with gettin' my cheese and fuck the process

Oh Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day

No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef 'til I burn (hahahahahahahahahahahaha)
Censor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you can recall me anti-social
Niggas shakin' like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em'
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Tzu
Niggas do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evenin'
Best believe they runnin' for my dogs in the mornin'
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my niggas mourn me? (how long will they mourn me?) Gettin' blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin' close to my third, I live a troubled life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, nigga watch for bustaz'
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler

Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta
Makin' hell for a hustler
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgement day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let 'em play me for a busta
Makin' hell for a hustler

If it's on then it's on
We break beat breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To the shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on
We break beat breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
To the shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild
Do we all die
This is how we ride
Not knowin' if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin' with my motherfuckin' guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild
Until they all die, Outlaw, baby

Yes, yes yes
The Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary, aiite
Only God can save us
Nuttin but boss players
Outlawz and thugs
No time for the drugs
Now the rap game, similar to the crack game

Let Me Blow Ya Love,UnKnown,1998,"Turn it up loud
(Laughs)
Hey, man
You lil' sucker for love
I can't lie, word up, you sucker for love
(Laughs)

I should seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin' at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out, just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucker for love

If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
(Sucker for love)
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
(Sucker for love)
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
(Sucker for love)
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin' promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin' on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin' low, losin' control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin' calls at the house, guess you cheatin'
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin', I'm a sucker for love

If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
(Sucker for love)
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
(Sucker for love)
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
(Sucker for love)
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucker for love

If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
(Sucker for love)
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
(Sucker for love)
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time

Val Young

Searchin' for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin' jewels and shit, yaknahmean?
(You can be Christian)
Straight tatted up
(Baptist, Jehovah Witness) No doubt
(Islamic) No doubt (Doesn't matter to me, I'm a thug)
(Thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bitch, set it off, nigga...
We believed in you
For everything you do
Just wanna let you know how we feel
Black Jesus

I do my shootings on a knob, prayin' to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin' he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards
Like I'm jailin', shots hittin' up my spot like midnight rains hailin'
Got me bailin' to stash more green guys
Ain't tryin' to be trapped on no block
Slangin' them rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin'
Wonder how shit like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
God's words or a curse like crack?
Shai-tan's way of gettin' us back
Or just another one of my Black Jesus' traps

Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin' up in silence
Dark prayers, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
Give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
'Cause I swear, they tryin' to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin' down at this bottomless pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus

All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahaha
He's like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

Stick-ups, rob past niggas with trigger hiccups
Bodybag you punk pickups when these niggas go put they shit up
Nine-and-a-half out of ten, shorty be twistin' they wrists in cuffs
And for hustlin', go ride on the block with cop Glocks bustin'
They thinkin' that it's funny to kill for real
Plus gettin' twenty 20 bills, twenty minutes makin' money still
Patrollers be rollin' tryna hold us and haunt us
All swooped up and on us, 'cause we groupin' up on corners
My Black easy Jesus, please somebody feed us
I'm shootin', startin' a revolution with my kids
My cell block, whatever, held rock but never
Too close to the sword, he got jail dropped forever, Black Jesus

To this clique I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league niggas pray together
Bitches in they grave while my real niggas play together
We die clutchin' glasses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Cremated, last wish is niggas smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin', hopin' for possibilities
I'll mob on, while they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hate the people livin' in them
I was born an inmate, waitin' to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast 'til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine, trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
Bitches freeze facin' Black Jesus

All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Submissive souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
Like a saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus

Some say, one day
Some day, some how
Some way we gon' fail
Either six ditches or twelve
Just stick us and leave us in jail
Oh well, I bail, blazed out drunk as hell
Waitin' to fade, 'cause Black Jesus see
Just how this world treat His seeds, His young
Beat us 'til we dumb for fun, why run
When the outcome don’t do me justice in the long run
So I say, ""Fuck this whole world, bitch,"" breathless
Time is tickin', our minds clickin', 'til we blackout
Goin' all out, overboard route for clout
And Black Jesus come and save our seeds 'cause we need you
All play by the same to see us, Black Jesus

Killuminati (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,1999,"Makaveli the Don, break on 'em!
Ah put ya, ah put ya hands on ya, hands on ya heater
Hands on ya, hands on ya heater, hands on ya, hand…

Let it be prophesized; niggas'll die because your crew's doom
Around the way niggas get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones, niggas is bold and they choose to roll
I kill 'em all, watch now, nigga, truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
Niggas dyin' by my 30 odd, brains is splattered
Wonder why these niggas cross me, I'm certified crazy
So sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, every time I ride is for reasons
Hard to kill a nigga 'cause I'm comin' back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation, runnin' from drug cases
Lookin' at my congregation so full of thug faces
Mama gave a nigga breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin' niggas watch they every step
Label me a threat and I ain't even got started with this shit yet
Thug style, baby, hands on my pistol, listen
I'm a rider, every nigga breathin' pay attention
'Bout to show you motherfuckers how it feel to drop a body
A simple glimpse of my lifestyle, Killuminati…

(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!

Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)

After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
'Til I make it, yo, my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to bitches too scary, get too near me, we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Psssh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It’s like I’m - dreamin', seein' scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked 4-5, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
Goddamn, now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
Nigga got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati

(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
Killuminati
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!

Hold it down!

Hold it down!

Check it, I spend most of my time hatin' niggas
Wantin' to bank niggas, because they come across as fake niggas
But we made niggas, old school in our thinkin'
While you sinkin', I comes out, fucked up, high as hell, drinkin'
Outlawz could never be bullshitters, what
We keeps it too assassin, none of y'all can deal with us
Got me thinkin' who's still with us or who haters
It don't matter 'cause put together none of y'all could take us
Y'all don't understand, I'll kill for this nigga, peel for this nigga
And when y'all dump out, be the shield for this nigga
E.D.I. Amin, ooh, Lordy Lordy
Kill 'em all for shorty, '96, it's Killuminati

They got me thinkin' strugglin' and hustlin's my only fate
Toppin' grams on the kitchen plate
Tryin' to keep that money straight
Times is where I be up on these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back, wrapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed
Thirteen, got a package from the devil, payin' my deeds
Preoccupied by the greed in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's, sippin' naughty thangs
Real as these tats on my body, and it's Killuminati

(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)
Hold it down!
(Killuminati and we got you, got you)
(Yo, Makaveli, they can't stop you)

Makaveli up in this bitch, worldwide mash, Westside
The question when asked, nigga, you know what time it is
You know what type of shit we giving you
You want that hip-hop, nigga, this that hip-hop for real
Hip-hop that sell five mill'
Fuck with me, nigga, you get killed

What's my motherfuckin' name, nigga? Like my nigga Dogg asked

Letter to the President (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,1999,"My letter to the President
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up
In the hood Send mo' troops
Dear President
Tell me what to do, these niggas actin' up
In the hood Send mo' troops

Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
Niggas fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin' I’ve been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
'Cause I’m seldom in the company of bitches
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
Each and every trick or bitch, inside the shit I kick
My heaviest verse’ll move a mountain
Casualties in mass amounts, brothers keep countin'
Fuck the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
Yours I’m a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody’s doped up, nigga what you smokin' on?
Figure if we high they can train us
But then America fucked up and blamed us
I guess it’s 'cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard shit
In case you don’t know, I let my pump go
Get ride for Mutulu like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo’ troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo’ troops
[Verse 2: E.D.I. Amin & 
Kastro
]
Oh you's a baller in the White House
I hope you comfortable 'cause yo' I spend my nights out, with the lights out
Under the safety of darkness
Amongst the crazed and the heartless
And young soul bros
And a Mr. cobra contest
With all these problems my world
Spendin' this drama on earl
My President never seen senate with pleasure like
Whatever momma tell me she hit it
No not the lottery shit
Meanin' she do what I ain't do
Break her off before I did
Slip deep into the mind of a loner
My foes say fuck him, he’s a goner
But it ain't no shorts up on these corners
On a mission
Listen, let’s ease my guard with precision
Personally my decision
When I realized this ain't livin'
How you really ain't know
How this ghetto life go
For me and all my homies, when our enemies bone
You got the C.I.A
And we got our A.K
For protection, in our section
In the felony days
To the President, (Ha ha)

( Check it )
Mr. President I represent the ghetto
Tell your wife hello, I got to go
I be brief with this pedigree
Niggas is locked and said blocks on Penitentiary life
More niggas in jail than baptized
For centuries minority families how you stay lackin'
Homeless shelters over-crowded and you still taxin'
Homies dyin' out who got the clout, not me
You get more time for five grams, than a half a key
Black poppin' rocks, and whites on the potty rhyme
And why don’t test mine, rather die than let you see me cry
Across the border ask the lord to put somebody in your seat that cares
How can we stay in this world we supposed to share
Democrats, Republicans scum me to the concrete
No education inflation's covered by white sheets
Try to ball legally conspiracy surrounds me
So I’m a outlaw from now until eternity
Forever Mussolini

Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas actin' up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These niggas, actin' up

Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He’s scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug Nigga
We tired of bein' scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin'
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bitch ain’t never did shit for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin' hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
Is a nigga on the tightrope, screamin' let him die
Can’t lie I’m a thug, drownin' in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma’s strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President

Blacks is broke, think it’s a joke that we livin' low?
Y’all sniffin' blow and postin' what they hittin' fo’?
Tell the secretary it’s necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin' sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin'
'Til then we gonna keep it comin', Mr. President
And I meant every word in my letter to the President

Hehe
Word motherfuckin' life
Fuck this nigga think?
Cuttin' taxes, takin' off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin'?
Motherfuckers crazier than a motherfuckin' scout
Nigga this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz nigga
We fin' to hustle 'til we come up

I mean shit, I hear you screamin' peace
But we can't find peace
'Til my little niggas on these streets get a piece
I know you fear me 'cause you too near me not to hear me

Sayin' you cuttin' welfare
That got us niggas on the street, thinkin' who in the hell care?
Shit, y'all want us to put down our Glocks and our rocks
But y'all ain't ready to give us no motherfuckin' dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid, think you got us lookin' to lose
Tryin' to turn all us young niggas into troops
You want us to fight your war, what the fuck I'm fightin' for?
Shit, I ain't got no love here

Put your hands on ya, hands on ya
(bust if we must and plus)
Outlawz in this muthafucka
(bust if we must and plus)
Fatal

There go my enemies, my heart beat, pump with ease
So I bust instead of waiting for you punks to squeeze
Give you all of my 3 pound rounds, so you can fall
Bit the fact that Outlawz just kicked down your door
Bitch niggas be fouling out, hacking me with them wack rhymes
Grabbing ya .9, shooting scared, tryin' to take mine
I'm putting pressure on you niggas when I mobb
Deep bringing the heat to your dirty ass squad
You can ride, point blank range, peep game
From the , contaminated criminal Hussein
Bitch nigga I'm caught at project steps with the Tec
Murder next, and rob any nigga any set
Hussein, the type of muthafucka dying with trey pounds
Ghetto types we drown, hollow points from the waist down

We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us

Now, as I approach the scene, from smoking green, got my eyes closed
Niggas I call 'em my foes, I make 'em die froze
Watch me make 'em bleed, makin' G's, Lord help me with it
Got me painting pictures of a meal ticket, help me get it
See me and pray for options, but the pressure's non stop
Niggas get to pistol poppin', then watch the body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit yo set, flash on
Blast on them bitch made niggas with my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin' for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seeing demons hittin' weed, got me hearing screams
Scared to go to sleep, I watch the scene like a dope fiend
Probably be punished for it, although you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggas past the clip and watch me bring 'em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for, I got the secrets of war

We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us

Kadafi, we do this thug life shit like 4 5 6 dick 'em
Down with no rounds left up in the pound when it sounds
Squeeze the lead off!, I blow his motherfuckin' head off!
Signal all the other Outlawz, as soon as shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain’t a cop here to stop me
These streets is black Hockey, your MOB? weak and sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass pre-style grammar
Locked in the slammer while I’m layed cocked cocked back like a hammer
Y'all newly wed’s throwing honeymoons, well times about up
Dummys I Leave no trace found with you face down stuck
Your biggest cannons couldn’t come close to touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt puttin' in work on your block tipsy

We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business if them jealous niggas fuck with us
We go to war bust if we must, plus
Handle our business when them jealous niggas fuck with us

Check the murder rate percentage, niggas is finished
Getting blood checks from clinics, this thug shit is in us
Flowing through my system, you a victim, blunts.. I twist them
Fuck the whole world it’s us against them

This shit is Flakey, making fags shaky, Niggas hate me
Scared to face me, knowing that the Outlawz raised me!
Put me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I flex my money muscle, all the cheese got doubled
Moving shit like a dolly, beating niggas like Rodney
Turn a killa like Gaddafi if the new street is

That's right
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
'96 big body sittin' on chrome
'96 big body sittin' on chrome

Somebody wake me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed, the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
On the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' ""stop""
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to fuck her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, the product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive?
Got me askin' white Jesus ""will a nigga live or die?""
'Cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep, dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I open my window, jump to the streets and get to creepin'
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, out tryin' to hustle on my own
On this block where everybody and they pops tryin' to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong 'cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man, he's a mind reader
Keep my nine heater all the time, this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetery then get smoked out, pass the weed, nigga
That Hennessy'll keep me keyed nigga
Everywhere I go niggas holla at me, ""Keep it real, G""
And my reply: ""'til they kill me,"" act up if you feel me
I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise

'96 big body sittin' on chrome
And still I rise
'96 big body sittin' on chrome

I stay sharp as always
Runnin' ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin' crews like two's, nigga, all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seems though
Be placin' triple beams and things, bro
Diamond pinky ring got the loot poppin' out my jeans slow

Dynamically this dude will twist your shit ceramically
Able to write a Fatal verse with no profanity
It's on for Al G., Nikko Storm and Nasty New
I put a hole in your crew, tryin' to pass me
With no remorse
You get blasted full force
A Nike endorsement doin' shootings on a horse
World wide supremacy
All y'all remember me
Hung over from Hennessy
With a menace intendency
Police be clockin' me
So I be dippin', slippin' sloppily
Sippin' Vodka, B
And ditchin' clips on private property
When five-O be comin'
Niggas be runnin' for they life and freedom
The type to beat 'em
Hittin' gates and break and try to lead 'em
To pit terriers, Monclair gettin' scarier
They nine's, they shoot 'em in secluded areas
The barrier, not me
I'm burned 'em off the dick, stayin' scot-free
'Til Task harass my ass and try to have the ave locked D
My nigga fell
Givin' a whole essence county trigger hell
Runnin' the fuckin' block and duckin' cops tryin' to get a bail

In '96 my Glock's my plastic passion for blastin' bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin' holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin', more greens the topic
And loot to keep the seams in my motherfuckin' jeans poppin'
Leavin' ya spleen to pick up
Half of you niggas is softer than a Snicker

Some competition, so they say, these niggas is gay if you ask me

Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul nigga, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead and buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll

Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
Niggas get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life in fuck 'em mode, exposin' tragically
How can we find some peace and niggas still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hell bound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satan infiltratin', my military mind

Explode on these bitch made niggas

Criminal ways of thinkin', I'm gettin' paid wit' Lincolns
Niggas turn made victims, get my rage from a gauge hittin'
Hittin' ya back, you ain't kickin' no facts
Fakin' jacks, you and ya bitch clique could get this AK
Hold a pound four, you catch a flame from my torch
The game was taught, I want my name in the source
Little nigga, from jumpin' GZA, Now thanks to Pizzah
I'ma tote the pistol, And slang the white coke crystal
The papers stack up, young niggas back up
Give me the beat and ill rip the track up
Just in case you wanna act up

Nigga it's like this
I been thuggin' just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and shit
And it's all for the pressure
That'll make me cock my shit up off the dresser
Made nigga mafia of course my niggas gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a fuck session, Jersey where the niggas flexin'
Po-po's guessin' if the stolen car about to do a drive-by
Wet 'em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry (cry-cry), but it ain't my time to even die-die (die-die)
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life (my life, my life in the sunshine)
For the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin

Seein' my opportunities through these bars of hell while gettin' high
As life replays like time; underhanded schemes
To get that cream and thangs while livin' this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 ways to hit they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals to every last mineral we institutionalized
Locked down, got me shell shocked, now
Holdin' down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style

Yo I been losin' sleep, stayin' up way past late
With no hesitation K will lace 'em, now how the game tastin'
Awful good to me, let me see who would thought that
This shorty'll be a thug nigga, unsupported, never shorted
Winner, pleasurable sinner plus a rebel and, thuggin' and lovin' it enough to hug it like my next to kin
Bust it like a gang of Mexicans
They won't rush him on a solo
Watch me flexin' on 'em and stolen guns, bustin'
You should fuck the world before you fuck wit' me
Young nigga sheddin' TEC tears through these next years
Homie, tatted down and I think I'm addict now
For holding it down all around these immortal grounds

So Much Pain,Don’t Go 2 Sleep (Bootleg),2001,"As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back,  it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Now everythings good in my hood
And its on and pop and Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E
From East Side South Compton
Str8 givin' up the real
On how a nigga feel talk that shit
Muthaphukkaz caps get peeled
Layin' low in the cut
Gettin how than a muthaphuka niggas knows whats up
I'm that gangsta, gangsta is that what there still yellin'
Nigga G to a T saggin' and bailin'
Live by the gun you know what I'm sayin' Ren
""Yea""
So I guess I'll die by that muthaphukka then
So when I die niggas bury me
Make sure my shit reads Eazy-Muthaphukkin-E

To a nigga nature
Hehe

No need to cry now, go wipe your tears
Be a woman, why you actin' surprised?
You showed the bullshit; commin' fake hair
Fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it
Why you lookin' sad, should'a though about it
Say you learn, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla ""Dom Pérignon""
Knowin' I'm a cash dealer, still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me
Plus you was smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for trynna dick me
Missed me with that ""buy me this, buy me that""- syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad 'cuz I cursed and I screamed I hate ya
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me

Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way

Probably too nice at first
I lettin' you kiss where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slangin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, toungkissin', you was truly with it
Little Ecstasy, Hennessey, mix with me
Picture me pray for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' at the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the room, call the cops
Nigga, hit them walls til the bastard drop
Label me: Makaveli - Thug Nigga with pipe
Livin' life as a Rock Star friday nights
Make money, get pussy
Always keep a pager, cell-phone in the ride
To complete my Nature now!

Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way

Started as a seed from the semen
Straight outta Papa's nuts, lustin' for creamin'
Bitches wit big butts, curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in, helped a nigga passed the time
With my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood
Follow me, I got a gun on me
Goin' for nun on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' til I die
Picture of nigga in heaven high, of weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies with the phonies that died
Hit the weed and hope it get me high
Dear God, understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart
In a realla nigga nature!

Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way
Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature

Niggas talkin' bout we can't rap? Niggas must nota' never heard no motherfuckin'
Track off a death row nigga
DEATH ROW, WESTSIDE
Let's get it on, daylight or fuckin' nightbreak
MOB
Go into these niggas, to the motherfuckin' death

Come hell or high water
, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk ‘cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, Your Honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me, another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay Z and still avoid capture
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin' then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas player-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin' ""Death Row!"", throw my Westside, ain't no thing
We was raised off driveby's. brought up to bang
We claim mob. MOB. if you be specific
We control. ALL cash from the Atlantic, Pacific
And get this. I'm hard to kill
While I build with this live spot
Father. how the hell did I SURVIVE. these five shots?!
Live it up or give it up
And like DEMONS. late night. hear 'em screamin'
WE GOIN' ALL OUT!

With money clutchin', bail, come murder man, po's rushin'
Cap tilted to the side, on the lean out the ride bustin'
Outlaws enforce the secrets of war, but won't abuse it
Burnt, bury my burners with my dead buddies when I use it
Give a fuck about later. shots warm through the equator
Death to you traitors, shots bitin' through your bones like alligator
Payin' my dues. lookin' for miscellaneous infamous crews
Old ladies sing the blues. leave them smokin' from they shoes

Now with my every wakin' moment
I'm on a quest to be better, yeah
Position myself to prosper state, prepared for whatever
But at times, I slip slightly, shit I ain't afraid to admit it
To gone, off that Novocaine, like in too hard to live it
And I'm just a smidgen past my teenage years. into adulthood
Now I ride with G's finally, knowin' myself good
And it felt good, when I was young but playtime's over
EDI here take this gun nigga it's over

I piss cold blood, shit hot liquor out my liver
Smoke like a tail pipe, and write when I'm bitter
All my life I been considered a downright, dirty nigga
From when daddy knocked mama' s twat popped the last drop from the litter
Tell me give the world hell
But in hell I give 'em mo'
And I bail outta jail
Screamin' fuck the Po' Po'
When I run to take that enough, from a simple fuck
To multimillion dollar luck

Plus I think it's time to grab all pistols, wave them shits in the air
Celebrate Outlaw livin' nigga, I wouldn't be here
To you death is losin', and to me this shit's a family reunion
And to hell wit a peace treaty, never call it, cause it wouldn't feed me
My wallet. be as empty as the day I got started
Twelve shots in my pocket, left my niggas departed
It's a shame that these snake vultures niggas coldhearted
In a dirty world where only God know yo death and can call it

We thugged out, low cut, Outlawz rush and royal flush
Bomb first kickin' dust. out in Cali, but I ain't in it so much
Make 'em pay state to state, NJ to CA
Them cowards felt the weight, and turned feminine like Michel'le
Niggas change they whole style when the outlawz comin'
A million miles and thuggin'

While the rapture. capture this fuckin' style that I master

Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep (Don't go to sleep)
But don't fall asleep

Sleep baby
Not sleep in the physical form but I mean sleepin' mentally
I mean when niggas close they eyes to the way the game go
You can't fall asleep my nigga
Not on Death Row

Mic check, one two, one two, one two
I flip a double deck and stress ya
Snap on this rap
And cut him from his neck to his rectum
Jersey Jigga another nigga from a drug stomach
Fiend for hundreds so if I want it, I'm a thug run it
Robbin' cradles and robbin' niggas for bitches
Robbin' bitches for their riches 'cause I'm straight pullin' switches
Fuck phonics, I cool by the school pumpin' 'notic's
At lunch sharin' a stunt, with a blunt fulla chronic
The Madman, I'm tryna let you know 'bout the badland
So now I'm in your town takin' 'em down to the caravan
Deep like them Jeep as niggas at the greet
So when I creep don't sleep
Or watch your floo' catch a slow leak

Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall asleep
You can get your cash on nigga if you peep
Other niggas close their eyes seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

Hahaha!!
Don't go to sleep nigga
Don't go to sleep
Outlawz nigga!
Outlawz!
Mutherfuckin' M.O.B
Money over bitches
Bullets to the tricks
You know what time it is nigga
Don't go to sleep
Bad Boy Killa
There's no one realer
Mobb Deep killa
Chino-X kill..
Hahahahaha
All you niggas die
In your motherfuckin' sleep
Go ahead close your eyes motherfucker
You sleepin' on us
Close your eyes nigga
You sleepin' on the Westside
Go head
Go Fall asleep
Close your eyes
Rock-a-bye-baby
On the tree top
When my Glocks loaded them nigga will drop

Everybody dies...",https://genius.com/2pac-dont-go-2-sleep-original-version-lyrics
All Out,Until the End of Time,2001,"We goin' all out, we goin' all out
We goin' all out
Watch your motherfuckin' mouth, niggas!
(That's right, fuck these fag niggas!)
Do it, do it, do it!

Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap, back like a cobra
I stay drunk ‘cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
And still down to die for all my soldiers like hillbillies
They don't fear me, so we feud, bringin' war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, Your Honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit, heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me, another gay rapper
Bustin' caps at Jay Z and still avoid capture (Buck buck buck buck)
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin' then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
Niggas player-hatin', got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin' ""Death Row!"", throw my Westside, ain't no thing
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this: I'm hard to kill when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the Hell did I survive these five shots?
Live it up or give it up and like demons
Late night, hear them screamin', ""We goin' all out!""

We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out

I'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
Feelin' like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mob niggas hidin' in bushes
Claimin' that they ride rough, but they softer than cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin' in blood
Outlawz, my blood brothers, I'd die for these thugs
Say hi to this slug
It's a shame how some niggas on the West Coast
Was ridin' with 'Pac, but when he died they went pop
I'm out in Jers, to the fullest, like some West Coast love
But after 'Pac stopped rappin', it ain't no West Coast thug
Just West Coast, slut, to my real niggas stuck in the street game
‘Cause rappers like Jay Z be pumpin' Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin'? Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo'-fo' put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggas be bitin' this
It's all from my heart when I was writin' this; all out!

We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out

Now, we all ride, and down to die — who with us?
Speak up or get treated like you comin' to kill us
They ain’t nothin' but squealers
In this rap game, swearin' they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'Pac
Stop that, and watch your back, we ain't forgot 'bout ya
These Glocks hot, and when shot it'll bring the bitch up out ya
It's me, Kastro with the goattee, walkin' like a OG
‘Cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to thug lords like them motherfuckers holy
Frontline soldier, 'til the Heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' 'bout, ‘cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'til they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggas they can't deal with
Holla back, right back, and watch your mouth
Or get blood in it, what! We goin' all out, nigga!

We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out

Fool, you better go all out
Keep goin' all out
All my niggas goin' all out
Without a muthafuckin' doubt
Aye, you niggas just gon' think you gon' be uhh
Talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
And we ain't gon say shit
Now it's 1999, it's a different grind
Don't disrespect the Don
It's still war, motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know",https://genius.com/2pac-all-out-lyrics
Ballad of a Dead Soulja,Until the End of Time,2001,"Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier

The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dogs, official mob figures
Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas
I can be lost in my own mind
To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Talkin' to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin' ""Fuck the police!"" as I ride through the night streets
Little child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman
Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes…

Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin', ""Bloody murder, murder!""
Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homie had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back
Upon my secret arrival
Two Glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals – tell me, what you want, Lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord
The situation's critical, nothin' is colder
Than hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my Glocks rang out, the niggas came out, BOOM!
Who wanna see me in a challenge?
So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads
Do you feel me? Capo or Capi-tan
One day I'll be the Don; until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' 60 years
Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All they promise us is death, nigga
Take a breath, come be the last one left, nigga
It's real now, feel it or fantasize it, ain't nothin' colder
Listen, you can hear it – the ballad of a dead soldier

Thug for Life, I will be
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
A life of crime I will lead
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
It's a crazy world full of sin
Close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier

This go out to Kato, Mental, all the niggas that passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku – all the down-ass riders
All the niggas that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggas that go through that day-to-day struggle
(This is the ballad of a dead soldier!)
All the niggas that passed on
All the niggas with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggas that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha (It's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, (Ballad of a dead soldier!)
Tryin' to see me in chains, shit
Them niggas'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in Hell
(‘Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!)
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin' block; fuck the cops!
The police? We run these streets, nigga
(Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!)
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire, shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know – it's the ballad of a dead soldier!",https://genius.com/2pac-ballad-of-a-dead-soulja-lyrics

Ever to touch this microphone
Got you bitch niggas trailin' his tail

Breathin’,Until the End of Time,2001,"Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me, nigga, tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?

Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

Woke up with 50 enemies plottin' my death
All 50 seein' visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga, I was stressed
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie, sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block
Call the cops, a thug nigga screamin' Westside
Bustin' double Glocks
, hittin' corners in my Chevy Suburban
Liquor got me drivin' up on the curb
Hand on the steerin' wheel, swervin'
Bless me, Father, I'm a sinner, I'm livin' in hell
Just let me live on the streets ‘cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin' world-wide exposure
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a fuck, ridin' as my soldiers
I just release 'em on a war path, not your average dealer
Westside, Outlaw, 
Bad Boy killa
Complete my mission, my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas, now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt
For all my soldiers gone we burnin' the Earth
Outlawz worldwide, we pack the block
Shootin' rocks at the kid, 
I'll bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble,
 Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin'

Now, we was raised ""fuck this life,"" my wrongs, my rights
Holdin' on a tight grip, with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleep walkin' as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of bitter food
Came a long way from my born day
Dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends! I'll say, rather die for my A-K
With these fag ass niggas, see-through-glass ass niggas
Only-ride-my-dick-and-the-skin-of-my-mash ass niggas

Stressed but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds
Catch 'em while they sleepin'
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'

I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin' 'bout a bad day—I live a life like that
It's severe, and I'm losin' my hair, bless a hooligan
Catch me, I'm fallin' out flat yo, I'm ruined and
Breathin' in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I learned to like it like that when I was still in Mommy
The side of the city that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin'!

And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r, one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one, motherfucker, 'bout to do it again
Shit, Pac still doin' it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million every time he drop, I know you fuckers losin' it
We movin' in for the kill, for a meal, holdin' steel
Hold the wheel
I'm 'bout to give these niggas somethin' they can feel
Fakin' real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin', thug-lyin' niggas, give it up! 
We hit 'em up!

And we still breathin' and we still breathin'…
(Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?)

Tell 'em! Nigga, tell 'em! (And we still breathin'…)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?

Stressed but busta free

To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Bustin' my automatic rounds

Everything They Owe,Until the End of Time,2001,"Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)

We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
'Cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin' what you thinkin' but you must abandon ship
'Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin' the reverend from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't 'bout talkin' 'bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin' back, for everything you owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'

How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!!
Psssh

Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, ""Where is the quaaludes?"" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed ""Nigga motherfucker""
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option
God damn!
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
Move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, repossessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe

I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit' a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me

I wanna be… yo let me fuck that nigga down
What’s that? Ayo, what you doin' with that big ass?
My ghetto love song (hahaha)
Set it off, set it off! Let’s be friends! Where my niggas at?
Where my niggas, where my niggas, where my niggas at?

As you pass bye, winkin' my eye, freshly scented

You can help me multiply my stacks, baby
Currency seems small, I need companionship
Through with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit

Check out my diamonds, bitch, everyone gonna blink
This be a thug thing, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my résumé, sippin' on Cristal and Alizé
Smokin' on big weed keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree read briefly, they're so cheap
Puttin' bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?

Understand this: ain't no nigga like me,
 
fuck Jay-Z!

Where the niggas with money? Where you at, baby?)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends (Cash makin' hoes)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin' for you
Hardcore, starin' and watchin'
Me and you, one on one, picture countless options
Was it prophecy? Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess bubonics
Far from a crush, I wanna bust your guts and touch
Everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin' like a fat girl goin' for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin' like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6? Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!
Back to you, my pretty-ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs, now let me in between as friends

Let's be friends (Westside, motherfucker, right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends

Why you trickin' on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (Westside in this motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all
Long as you just bring me your friends
(In this motherfucker right here)
Why you trickin' on them other hoes? Let's be friends

Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks?
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame, my dick or the game?
Bet I screamed Westside when I came (Westside!)
Scream my name ‘cause, baby, it's delicious
Ghetto weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back get into it (into it)
Make it fluid (fluid), in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high, let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby, let me ride!
Who wanna stop me? Am I top notch?
Fuck player-hatin' niggas, ‘cause they cockblock
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a livin' out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizin' seein' you naked
It's the fuck song so check my record and let's be friends
Where my niggas at? Show me where my niggas at?
Where my bitches at? Thug style!

Fuckin Wit the Wrong Nigga,Until the End of Time,2001,"Niggas.. fuckin' with the wrong nigga

My seductive introduction be specific
Still elusive, but exclusive's what I give you when I kick it
And I'm still lifted; niggas can't get with Mr. Wicked
Picture me flippin' my adversaries, gettin' the dick swiftly
Niggas is swingin' wild, but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch, but your whole click will still get treated shitty
Business never personal
I'm up before the sun come up, I'm tired
Just a ghetto star, a drop top double-R is what I'm ridin'
Nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring yo' artillery when you come for me, ‘cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast, ‘cause Syke was bustin'
Plus, Bo had 'em duckin', screamin', ""Get they cash!""
So now I got the law on me
My phone's tapped, so I had to send word through my lil' homies
Tell them niggas this the year when they pull the trigger
Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin' with the wrong nigga

This is what you get
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Hehehehe, yeah, nigga, peep it

Before I lay me down to sleep, I pray and thank the Lord
For givin' me another fruitful day
I wanna be a peaceful, man, but still when niggas come for me
All I can see is gettin' 'em killed
For real, it's how I feel
Reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel; they caps peeled
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give him the MAC and make him spray hisself, heyyy
Fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
Puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in Heaven
Why call in shots? Nobody really as clear as me
Ain't tryin' to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder, my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death, so my true niggas show me love
God, forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
You know?

It's like.., why you fuckin' with the wrong nigga?

I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise, but they tried me
I guess they all had to die, ‘cause we tried peace
I die in these streets
Blast 'til they recognize
Still do or die, all my niggas gettin' high, watchin' time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride, so they can't stop it
Then keep it poppin', lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked your bitch, and now this new shit, gon', fade 'em all
My niggas ball, made a call for some back-up
The lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
""Buck buck"" was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
Should've never fucked around, buster
How you figure makin' moves on the wrong nigga

It's what it sounds like, ding ding ding..
When you fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Niggas gettin' hit, when they fuckin' with the wrong nigga
Fuckin' with the wrong nigga",https://genius.com/2pac-fuckin-wit-the-wrong-nigga-lyrics
Good Life,Until the End of Time,2001,"I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin' for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin' insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' ""Fuck the world"" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin' 'til I earl, spendin' money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggas got it goin' on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day, bumpin' this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life

This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust the hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
See, we live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

No one knows what the, future holds, for you
Haha, listen closely
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
Who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin' and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin' tryin' to survive
Some wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin' season, give me the reason
Why I should change, into a softie
.. after livin' so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggas, and my girl - livin' the good life!

We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die
Uh ha, We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die

I spend my days and nights not knowin' if, strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin' way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin' big ceilin'
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
But we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin'
Bitch nigga get to runnin' 'fore my click get to gunnin'
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
We still tryin' to get a hold of the game
Livin' that good life

We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uhh
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't, uhh
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggas that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die, uhh
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb bitches that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
And live the good life, 'cause thug niggas don't die",https://genius.com/2pac-good-life-lyrics
Happy Home,Until the End of Time,2001,"Home man.. hey.. (what's up) let's turn this house into a happy home
This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
Let's turn this house into a happy home
Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Let's turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for mine
Outlaw.. look

Now we've been kickin' it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We done fought so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change in time
It's only 'cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police,
 
I never call you bitch or ho'
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home

Ha..ppy.. home..
(let's turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..

Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin' hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home

Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(finally got to live the good life inside a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(Happy home)

All these problems got me goin
We got a family, of our own
I just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(finally got to live the good life inside a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin'
Packed in a Suburban, screaming, ""Outlaw!"", runnin' on the curb
They never try me, 'cause right behind me yo' killer team
I get the word, cut the head off a nigga, like a guillotine
This Hennessy will keep me calm though
Sittin' in the back of the club, tradin' convo
Livin' like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga, watch me with the chrome 9
All the time drinkin' champagne
Walk through the crowd, let the tramps hang
Niggas player hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin' 80, down a one-way
Stuck in the trunk, caught in gunplay
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin' high, wonder why we gotta die smokin'
My alibi; a victory
Victim of a rhyme in a mark for death
Spendin' my nights like it's the last one left
I'm an outlaw

Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, I'm the last one left
Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
I'm at the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor

I got my back against the wall, gat chillin' by my balls
Prior to war is a rider nigga that's only 5'6"" tall
Napoleon only knows on we Outlaws, fuck fear
Better strap down to the fullest, ‘cause we outchea
Thug passion all up in me, feelin' like I took some Henny
It ain't easy, I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of two pennies
What we got is rep, nigga, wanna pull their gat, nigga
He’s only got my side 'cause they think 'Pac died, nigga
Blast niggas with our TEC's, takin' showers in our vest
'Pac, come and catch weight, nigga, we the last ones left

Indeed I'm knowin' it's own inside my own dome
Fresh outta jail, it was hell, but I'm finally home
Lookin' for niggas that was woofin' that shit, when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, make 'em jump when it cocked back
Fuck 'em all, they bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak, we the last ones left

Tell me, am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, last one left
Am I wrong? I wanna get it goin' on, last to leave
'Til I see everybody's gone
At the bar, you can catch me, hands full of liquor
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher, I'm last one left

I eat and sleep the worst shit, cursed from birth
Me and my team super supreme, puttin' in work
I'm passed out, drunk as a fuck, 'til it hurt
And I call Earl screaming, ""Fuck the world!""
I got a bitch on the side wanna be my wife
And wifey beefin', wanna know if she gon' see me tonight
And I know it ain't right, but it's the life I got
And that's until I see Yak, and that's until I see 'Pac
Young know I lost a troll, somebody owed me down
And if the world was a girl, I'd stick my dick in the ground

Letter 2 My Unborn,Until the End of Time,2001,"To my unborn child…
To my unborn child
In case I don’t make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you

Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
‘Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate?
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way?
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
‘Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say

Dear Lord, can you hear me?
Tell me what to say
To my unborn seed in case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love?
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
‘Cause bein' black hurts, and even worse if you speak first
Livin' my life as an Outlaw – what could be worse?
‘
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who'm I kiddin'? I'm a thug 'til I die
; I'm a rider, mane
Touch bases, eat lunch in plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein' there
Just know your daddy was a soldier: Me Against the World
Bless the boys and all my little girls
To the Lord: I'm eternal, restin' in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child

Please take care of all my kids and my unborn child
To my unborn child…
This letter goes out to my seeds
That I might not get to see ‘cause of this lifestyle
Just know your daddy loved you
Got nothin' but love for you
And all I wanted was for you to have a better life than I had
‘Cause I was out there on a 24 hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age, you’ll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I’ll see you if there’s a ghetto in Heaven
If there’s a Ghetto Heaven, I’ll be there waitin' for you
Heh heh, take care, run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know sometimes there’s confusion
Rules of the game is gonna get you through it all day every day
Watch out for these snakes and fakes
Friends come a dime-a-dozen
Be an individual, work hard
Study, get your mind sharp, trust nobody",https://genius.com/2pac-letter-2-my-unborn-lyrics

Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Lil' homies
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies

Just pay attention, here's a story 'bout my lil' homies
Straight thuggin', lil' bad young mothafuckas, gotta love 'em
You could catch him in his G ride clutchin' his Glock
Screamin', Outlaw! (Westside mothafuckas) bustin' on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin' money, makin' dummies out the police
Ain't no peace for an adolescent nigga too wild to be a thinker
Bud smokin' 24/7, everyday drinker
Got my diploma, but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder, fool!
Always the young niggas gettin' in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate, so you called her a bitch
Bustin' on paper thin mothafuckas
Drinkin' gin before you get to sinnin' on them busters
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets

I remember when you was just a lil' G
Flirtin' with death, playin' Russian Roulette, screamin', ""Kill me!""
Hey there, young nigga, what you smokin' on?
Mad at the world ‘cause you came from a broken home?
Love the squad plus your mob is sick
A bunch of adolescent niggas spittin' major shit
Tell me, young nigga, if you die, let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watchin' as your mother cries?
Will all your homies ride?
Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggas on a mission to compete
Gettin' G's, packin' heat, bringin' havoc to the fuckin' streets
Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
And unloaded on the whole front row
Try to tell him, but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and he show me; my lil' homie

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets

""First 2 Bomb,"" ""16 On Death Row""
Bustin' on them phony mothafuckas ‘cause the big homie said so
Niggas knew I was a nutcase, quick to blast
Livin' underage, but he'll blaze on your bitch-ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace, shell-shocked souls
Makin' money off of crack sales
Young black male unable to change ‘cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows the evil that they might do
Lil' Mu', Big Yak, K. Kastro
Big Malc, Hussein, call 'em Outlawz
Tellin' the world to be equipped
When these young mothafuckas rip shit, they don't quit
Drew down on me, pulled a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me; my lil' homies

Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets

What's up, nigga, let's do this shit! My lil' homies!
Lil' bad-ass mothafuckin' adolescent niggas! My lil' homies!
What the fuck you niggas wanna do?
WHAT, NIGGA? My fuckin' lil' homies
Sixteen, fifteen, thirteen, my fuckin' lil' homies
Juvenile delinquents ready to BUST on you mothafuckas
What the fuck you niggas wanna do, nigga?!
Nigga, take yo’ shit on, lil' homies!
We robbin' mothafuckas, nigga

 homie livin' that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggas in Penitentiary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin' with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggas with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches (keep it money over bitches)
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

I blow you up on the spot, these Glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police, peep what these streets do to me
Actin' all new to me, I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin' Cristal, start thinkin' 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin' my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

My shit's phenomenal, droppin' like domino
Comin' with the real yo, and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggas nationwide doin' work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra, with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em
Stackin' G's, my niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies
Money over bitches
(Nigga!)

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

I'm hittin' sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contrited to strive never laggin'
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin'
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin' up but I don't give a, fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin'
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin' my mind why you sweatin' me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin', I hope he awoken
Payin' my own that's tokin' chokin' off-a Glocks smokin'
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
Gettin' niggas fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin' ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin' in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin' a watch out for cops
Gettin' kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin' my money over all my bitches

M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches
M.O.B., nigga cause we mob on you tricks
And you know we keep it money over bitches

That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin' bitches
M.O.B. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin' mind on your money, fuck these hoes
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin' bitches
You need some motherfuckin' money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here..

My Closest Roaddogz,Until the End of Time,2001,"Here me and my closest road dogs
To my dog named Mussolini (you know it dog)
Big Syke (Westside)
Thug Life, baby (outlaw)
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Hahaha!

Shit half the times we fought and caused trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin' bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin' wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin' cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin' me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin' deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin' from the future, escapin' in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz

Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
(me and my closest road dog)
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine

Haha.. bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M.O.B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy you's a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer
Ain't tryin' to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M.O.B., 'til I die
, when we ride niggas disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
For leakin' information to the feds
The burnin' bed
 was the tellin' sign
Two hired guns bustin' everyone, yellin' everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz

Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
(Bleedin' like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz)
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz

Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin' through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin' out for all mine

Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin'
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin'
See me in physical form, my niggas swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin' jealous niggas 'til they purple
Simon Says
 take they heads homies
And send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin' for fake niggas, observe and shake niggas
The only way to see six figures, is break niggas
Me and Mussolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi,homicide ask us why
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..
Set to explode, my M.O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz

Every ghetto street got a crosswalk

Runnin’ on E,Until the End of Time,2001,"[Intro: 
2Pac
 & Hussein Fatal]
Is that if you a bad boy
Yo, what's up man
(The police comin'!)
Oh shit! (Get out of there)
(Yo, get the fuck out the way)
Fatal, Outlawz runnin' up out this motherfucker
I'm going past niggas
Ain't gettin' me out the game like this, fuck that!
It's Outlaw, nigga

If you a bad boy then you die
Westside Outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when they robbed me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside Outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when they robbed me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep

I focus my locus thought on the enemy
Sick of the Hennessy, it's necessary to finish me
I'm antisocial, immortal when it come to the vocal
Jersey them niggas down, and won't approach 'em 'til it's time to smoke 'em
Hussein the terrorist
Nigga they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they try to find me a therapist
Rapid fire, I clap an eye 'til you die a liar
Strapped and next hittin' corners dropped 'em didn't want to spin the tires
My man will find ya
This 357 anaconda is enough to brand ya mama then turn around and hand you drama
Military comradery, Oulaw 'til they body me
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin' at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep, you try to bust me 'til death?
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who, what, when and why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted

Now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin' damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash when flaunted
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me? Fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police
Who run the streets really?
In every hood legends grow
From the hustlas up in Harlem to shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress, we stressed
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
(Hey where that nigga...)

Halfway thugs don't budge when we stalk the streets
Sort of like chalk and narcotics when they walk the beat
You speak the beef pussy, draw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Gettin' mines with nine cocked extortin'
Blocks pop with 22's in my socks with the butt hangin' out the chocolate
You never seen time I travel across dream crime
My rolls like a million dollar bill, folded with green lines
Wit' my pulse racin'; drink my Henny straight no chasin'
Catch my body like cases; 5 minutes from the station

Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
No finger prints that mean there was no evidence or proof that I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk, fag motherfucka bleed
Money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bowin' off to one knee shit
The Glock to your head nigga, don't make no sudden action
Hit innocent bystanders when he blastin', dumped fuckin' backwards
Little homies puttin' work for stripes
But is it worth your life and G-rides runnin' red lights
I wish somebody would have told me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napoleon ain't no cell they can hold me in
Or cage me in, crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like them niggas gon' fade me in
Havin' a fiend page me (page me)
When they want the product, nigga I got the smoke
Got this weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you workin' with?, I'm on some ol' immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin' shit, use artillery to murder with
Put on the block, gangsta party and like 'Pac
Life's hard from the ox, me and my niggas on top (party)

I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E
I know the law hate me dearly, they comin' for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin' on E

Runnin' my Glock, put the lead in pop, fuck the law
Carry steel 'cause I live on the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes 'cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin'
Quick to blow and dispose if you plot on hittin'
Ridin' high, blazin', kryptonite got a nigga dazin'
Burpin' and smirkin' at enemies before I grave 'em
Ride up with the iron up, I see him, he slippin'
At a stop light on this lonely night
(This motherfucka trippin')
Slide on him, so I can dump and put it in him
(Damn, I guess this motherfucker know the vicinity)
Hit the pedal now we high speedin'
With my metal tryna make these motherfuckers die speedin'
Up the way I seen him slow down
(Shit! I think I done bucked these hoes down)
Caught 'em runnin' on E, that's kinda funny to me
They knew they was funkin' with me but they dumb to see

Open up fire watch 'em expire when my shells split 'em
Plus all them trick-niggas bitchin' can go to hell with 'em
Fuck 'em they phony claimin' they homies but they foes
Speakin' on thug niggas daily, while we nailin' they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words are known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
A crooked thought, cops get bought, no longer caught
Out on bail, raisin' hell, nigga fuck what you thought
Did you cry when my girl died?
Put out the hit, politic niggas worldwide, grabbin' my dick
I’ll never learn, take away the pain with sherm
Throwin' gas on my enemies watchin' 'em burn
Kamikaze, I’m shootin' up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piñata and party
His last breath, a straight lesson I possess like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E..

Stay thugged out keep it movin'
Runnin' on E
One time, one time for the niggas that stayed down for us
Runnin' on E
Smif-n-Wessun the Cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot, BDI, runnin' on E
The Bootcamp Click

This Ain’t Livin,Until the End of Time,2001,"This ain't livin'.. nigga!

I hear even the smaller G's be dippin' Chevy Impalas
While flossin' their gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We swallow tomorrow's seed, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em lead tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin' wine, they rap
Still I be starin', watch the parents sacrifice their child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin' so strong, make young boys into drug dealers
Now one for adolescents, now dos for those
Keep your friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin' to take my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw your hands in the air, it's a robbery
(censored) 'Pac, would you ride with me?
Let's go see what our enemies talkin' 'bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin' out
This ain't livin', it's similar to prison, we're trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
And never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know
This is how it goes when we floss with flows
Before I toss your ho, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows, make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin'

Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)
This ain't livin'

This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do

Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin' in the world of crime and I (takes a life)
Can’t find a better way to break through
This ain't livin', I gotta do what I gotta do

Peep it - gunfire is produced at alarmin' rates
Today's youth, quick to shoot, get in the car and break
""It Takes a Nation of Millions"" if we intend to stop the killin'
Just search your feelings, participatin' should be appealin'
They're our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue
My young nation, rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
That oppose when I froze them fools
And who are you, to watch me fall farther?
I disappeared, reappeared as the (censored)
Follow me now
Skippin' class, and livin' fast, will get your ass
Stuck in the Pen', doin' life plus ten
Young brother pump your brakes for me
Before you choke, won't you soak up some game from your big homie
This ain't livin', we givin' you jewels, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, hey
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin' hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me

Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)

By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
And if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
But do it lightly
Cause that excites me to lay the pipe
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin' me
I'm goin' deep, it's the thug in me
So whatchu sayin' girl?

A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, give it to me

That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)

Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggas in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin'
Tongue kissin', as I hit it from the back with the bed ringin' (haha)
Give me space, as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass
Love fuckin' in tha mo'nin'
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like
Blindfolded, I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin' in the chair, when ya lovin' me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, to get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin' you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you

A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, give it to me
I got a lot of thug in me (Maybe it's the thug in me).. lot of thug
That I wanna put in you
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you, can you check it
I got a lot of thug in me, do you want it
That I wanna give to you girl (Maybe it's the thug in you)

Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder
I make the room rumble, in and out long stroke
Hold ya breath now, close your eyes deep throat
Did you like it?.. Oooh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited
C'mon now, let me see ya shake your rump
Tell me, how long will it take to cum
Havin' fun, do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
To get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay
Only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came
I gotcha goin' wild, 'cause I'm lovin' you

C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin' car, man
Yo why you trippin' man? Get in the fuckin' car, man
Get in the fuckin' car.. get in the car
(Heh, say you, you scared to ride in my car
'Cause you, you think niggas gon' be blastin' at it
It ain't even that deep baby)

You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one clique, 
they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes

Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my comp
Gettin' wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump
While niggas run I'm the last one standin', the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life
, throats were slit
Niggas die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at 
Latin Quarters
Niggas tried to kill me, and I fed their wife and their daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin' past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggas never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck
Quit bullshit nigga 'cause I'm still fuckin' yo' bitch
Niggas got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame

Y'all remember ""Hit 'Em Up,"" don't make us do it once more
Yo' niggas know, you ain't fuckin' with them Out-lawz
We keep souljas, souljas from Compton to Brooklyn
Your the type to get sniped, when the cops is lookin'
Don't nobody give a fuck 'cause you done crossed the game
Lost in fame, and you should take, all the blame
You made yo' bed nigga lay in it
You scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it
It's not a game only got one click we Outlawz from the do'
Dirt stains when I buck on the fo', you kissin' the flo'
We dirty as the motherfuckin' streetz of Jerz
We sweep niggas with the words though the heat's preferred
Holla

You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes, let the punks know

'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin' car wit'cha
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God, nigga
I only got one click, Outlawz 'til I'm gone
Heavy in the game and we comin' for they fuckin' throne
The love is gone well it is what it is
And plottin' on us, they best be prayin' for they kids, mayne
You don't have to worry 'cause I ride for ya
Like K said over loyal we even tell 'bout a lie for ya
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya
And when it get to poppin' I'ma fuckin' ball for ya
And everything I do gon' have your names on it
I'll never let them forget I put my seeds on it

You gon' die before yo' time, come face the truth
In the middle of the desert nigga lace your boots
As a youth, hundred proof, tap my chest is a dead rest
You studio niggas still remind your vest
Why the fuck you ain't done yet, swallow yo' teeth
In the field you woulda been need a straw when you eat
Fuck a Glock nine that shit is weak on the streets
And if you can't strategize then you just can't eat
If your life in another nigga hand, you dead
And if it's beef and your man disappear then don't sweat it
Another fake nigga usin' my strengths to get credit
I mean you might face sound scared but your heartbeat said it

You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know

I was born ugly, unlucky and dusty
But now I'm a rider, connivin' gutsy
And I don't trust nobody, so don't nobody trust me
And that's how I'ma go about it 'til somebody bust me
I play for keeps like the OG's raised me
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?
And I think I'm goin' crazy 'cause my hair is gettin' thinner
I've been drinkin' on the daily, I can hardly remember
I got - bad nerves, paranoia destroyed me
I love the Lord but the church can't cure me
I sleep light, I wake peekin' out my window
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
And that's the way it's gonna be 'til they bury me
But don't twist it 'cause none of y'all niggas worry me
[Verse 6: Young Noble & 
Kastro
]
What the fuck you didn't know?
Kizza-Kastro
, Young Noble with the criminal flow
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, 
no dizoubt
My niggas couldn't fade me with some clippers
You put it down, look all around, 'til we find you we hound
Penitentiary bound, to remind you

Kadafi I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin' through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit, get me fee to let my ice click Ka-pling, ka-plow I been a thug shootin' slugs since a child

You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggas are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know",https://genius.com/2pac-u-dont-have-2-worry-lyrics
Until the End of Time,Until the End of Time,2001,"Perhaps I was addicted to the dark side
Somewhere inside my childhood witnessed my heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be? Through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask
For currency, 
but you could run to me when you need
And I'll never leave, honestly
Someone to believe in, as you can see
It's a small thing to a true, what could I do?
Real homies help you get through
And come to knew he'd do the same thing if he could
‘Cause in the hood, true homies make you feel good
And half the times we be actin' up, call the cops
Bringin' a cease to the peace that was on my block
It never stops, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be the same
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Please, Lord, forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know, I don't hang around the house much
This all-night money makin' got me outta touch
Shit, ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walkin' solo
Ride out alone in my lo-lo
Watchin' the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times, disappear, listen to the ocean
Smokin' Ports, think my thoughts, then it's back to coastin'
Who can I trust in this cold world?
My phony homie had a baby by my old girl
But I ain't trippin', I'm a player, I ain't sweatin' him
I sexed his sister, had her mumble like a Mexican
His next of kin, no remorse, it was meant to happen
Besides rappin', the only thing I did good was scrappin'
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time

Now who's to say if I was right or wrong
To live my life as an outlaw all along?
Remain strong in this planet full of player haters
They conversate, but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in the end, drinkin' Hennessy
Made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow, eliminatin' easily
Falls to they knees, they plead for they right to breathe
While beggin' me to keep the peace (haha)
When I conceive closer to achieve
In times of danger, don't freeze, time to be a G
Follow my lead, I'll supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the training to make a G
Remember me as an outcast Outlaw
Another album out, that's what I'm about: more
Gettin' raw 'til the day I see my casket
Buried as a G while the whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

So take these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time, until the end of time",https://genius.com/2pac-until-the-end-of-time-lyrics
When Thugz Cry,Until the End of Time,2001,"When thugs cry
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Got us dyin'
When thugs cry, times is hard

Born thuggin', and lovin' the way I came up
Big money clutchin', bustin' while evadin' cocaine busts
My pulse rushin', semi clutchin' into insanity
They shot at my cousin, now we bustin' at they whole family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. ‘cause I'm fuckin' his secretary
I black out and start cussin', bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic, and bitches duckin', I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
Why I have to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homie's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped her, so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin' hits out on politicians, even cops
I ain't lyin', they got me sleepin' with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin'
What is the meanin' when thugs cry?

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God (when thugs cry)
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

Maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin'
Where is the love?, never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggas I used to love, enclosed in Penitentiaries
But still, homie, keep it real, how does it feel
To lose your life, over something that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with your pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong? I put my soul in the song
To help us grow in time, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters to niggas and bitches
We went from welfare livin' to worldwide riches
But somethin' changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine, mayne
See, they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See, you gotta get high or die, ‘cause even thugs cry

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin' motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
‘Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name wit' a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless in my attack I take command of your dreams
Leavin' motherfuckers drownin' in they own blood
Clownin', takin' pictures later
Laugh 'bout them punk bitches that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin' your people disappear, you wonderin' where they went
Am I cold, or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body, God, don't let me suffer any longer!
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes; when thugs cry

Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?
Oh, why should you send your child off to die?
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry, dear God
Oh my, does it have to be this way?
Our children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry, dear God, oh why?

I shed tattooed tears for years
For my dead homeboys and my prison peers
Y'all ain't never heard my cries
Now you wonder why would you die?

Ayy Nas, remember that shit you said? I don't know what magazine you said it on... Some shit about we're sending thugs to whoever & whenever. You need to go to the record store and check out some of the albums you've been putting out, because you been spitting this thug shit for a while now. I know you've been listening cuz you've been biting this shit so, uh recognize and realize before your ass get rolled on!...",https://genius.com/2pac-when-thugz-cry-lyrics
Why U Turn On Me,Until the End of Time,2001,"(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers, just be friends)
Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turnin' on me?
Why me? Westside, how you do it boy?

I went from, nothin' to somethin' now they all wanna see me fallin'
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ballin'
They say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any nigga gettin' money
I made a song about my enemies and niggas tripped
It was hip-hop until 2Pac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggas hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggas get paid
Have me catchin' cases all across the nation
I went from jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin' three strikes
And we might, just blast God bless the child, that can get cash
But all these niggas turnin' and never learn
Got a long line of niggas player hatin' me but gettin' burned
Talk a lot of shit but you's a trick in drag
Like the MAC make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back stab

Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee (yeah nigga)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G

It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct
Although two juvenile delinquents, we still decent
Playin' catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin' drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin' brew
What you need nigga? Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? {​*laughter*}​
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat
Fuck {​Wendy Williams}​ and I pray you choke
On the next dick down your throat
For turnin' on me

Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin' on me?)
When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggas see me you flee
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G

I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll
Anybody ever seen {​Wendy Williams}​ fat ass?
Why you always wearin' Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat ho
I'm puttin' Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
Through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
And put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's 2Pac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
And Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
He shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin' ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
He don't step in the fuckin' ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what 2Pac gon' do
When niggas come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin' other
This old motherfuckin' nigga in the South told me nigga
It's more than one way to skin a cat
It's more than one way to shoot a gat
It's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it

Why you wanna turn on me?

When you niggas see me you flee (Why me?)

Words 2 My First Born,Until the End of Time,2001,"Hehehe, yeah
These are my words to my firstborn

Can you picture young niggas in a rush to grow?
'Til hard-timers in the pen' had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin'
Too busy bullshittin', caught him with his mouth runnin'
Ain't this a bitch? They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk police pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong 'cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style, runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit
Now shit is flipped,'cause niggas died over bullshit
It's not my dream, I'm seein' pictures of a broken man
No witnesses only the questions of who smoked the man
Young adolescents in our prime live a life of crime
Though it ain't logical, we hobble through these tryin' times
Livin' blind—Lord, help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer
One love to the thugs in Heaven, I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my firstborn—feel me!

My words to my firstborn
My words to my firstborn

Since my very first day on this Earth, I was cursed
So, I knew that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me, there was no distortion
'Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul, 'cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin'
Sometimes cats be sleepin' on the dead end, drivin' with the car runnin'
Blinded, ain't no love in the hood, only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, 'cause the family wasn't able
Can't blame her, I would do the same
All I could give her was my debt and my last name
'Cause in the game things change, livin' up and down
This hard life got me walkin' with my head down
Flashin' frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
My words to my firstborn—feel me!

My words to my firstborn
Mmm! (Yeah)
These are the words to my firstborn
Hey, nigga, talk to your born!
Talk to your seed, nigga!

Two thousand somethin' somethin' mention a new era
A nigga's too real, now see shit too clear
See, there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt
(What else is it, dawg?) – the velvet and the silk
And makin' sure my kittens got they milk
(Hoo!) Gotta fill this mattress
Let my kids know I'm at this
Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll
Ain't no question, is it? Above the Law hustlers
If it's related to chips, homie, we'll handle ya
Yo, although we never take advantage
Though we always into ery'thang
By all means, stack green, gangsta lean
They say money make the world go 'round
So, only associate yourself
With paper chasers and niggas that's truly down
And keep God first
And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
It's player haters every corner you hit
Touchin' their tits, hella thick, tryin' to get you for yo' grip
I know you stressed-out and fed-up
But come out, gun-blazin', and keep yo' head up
You can call it what you want to, but it ain't gon' change
Above the Law, 2Pac, O.G.'s in this rap game
And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Y'all, although we grew up corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom to give to our firstborn

What you gon' tell your kids, nigga?
Who was you? What was you doin'?
How did you put it down?
These my words to my motherfuckin' firstborn
So, they can know, y'knahmean? Hehehe
Ain't nothin' but a motherfuckin' rider
Westside 'til I die, that's all it was
It's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker
I just played to win, just played to win

To a nigga nature, haha..
(Oohhh)

No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman
Why you actin' surprised? You saw the bullshit comin'
Fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Ain't nothin' hard about it why you lookin' sad? Shoulda thought about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Pérignon
Knowin' I'm a cash getter still I remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you be smilin' 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin' to dick me
Missed me with that ""buy me this, buy me that"" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin' mad cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?

Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
Why cry, when he do you that way

I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin' busy, slingin' dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin', you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggas at? Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin' there sweaty and wet
Pointin' to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin' walls 'til them bastards drop
Label me Makaveli, thug nigga with pipe
Livin' life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!

Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's  nature
(That's a nigga nature)
Why cry, when he do you that way

Haha.. started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin' for creamin' bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin' for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin' 'til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin' dead homies wishin' phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin' major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature

Why cry, when he do you that way

Why cry, knowin' that's the nigga's nature

Smokin' weed like it ain't no thing, so even kids
Wanna try now, then lie down and get ran through
Nobody watches 'em, clockin' the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin' victims screamin'
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
‘Cause even our birthdays is cursed days

With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same, too many murders
Too many funerals, and too many tears

Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith

Thinkin' back as an adolescent, who woulda guessed
That in my future years I'd be stressin'?
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryna keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin' yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Savin' up for some Jordan's, ‘cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her, but she broke too
And so am I — I can't take her to the places she wanna go to
So, we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin' passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is your friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin', lookin' for them better days (for better days)

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

Now, me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or separated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gang-bangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin' like grown men when rollin'
Out in the dark, smokin' Newports, gamin' marks
Got a place in my heart, homie, stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin' you well, I know it's hell
Doin' time in the cells, you need mail when you in jail
And me, I'm doin' cool
I settled down, had a family, workin' a night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And I wonder how we ever came to this; I miss the better days

Better days, better days
Hey, better days
Thinkin' 'bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Hey
Better days
Got me thinkin' 'bout better days

I send this one out to all the homeboys down in, uh
Clinton lockdown, Rikers Island
All them dudes I was, uh, locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin', homeboy, keep your head up!",https://genius.com/2pac-better-dayz-lyrics

Part two of the war

Cross this nigga here, now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
My last foe flashed and I mashed his ass
Bastard, fuck with me, bet I blast your ass
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
Catch 'em, mimickin' my style tryin' to talk this way
Impossible my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watchin' niggas catch stray, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the street, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'
Bitch made catchin' feelins

Outlaw niggas, are you ready to clown?
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down

Picture me sippin' on 1-5-1
Drunk than a motherfucker droppin' my gun
Or high as a kite hittin' hoes for fun
But that ain't me, dog, my mind's now clear
And that ain't fair, dog, your heart pump fear
In the state I, shoot you better hide nigga, chute is near
And you know just as well I do
You ain't no killer, so kill that, you wouldn't kill if you had to
We might wobble, but we don't fall down
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around
Holla ""let's hit"", we gon' taste the power
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Now we coast together, put our thoughts together
Won't question when we die together
Cause the hour soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun
Bring it

Screamin' 
""Bye bye bitches, untouchable sound""
Ride or die niggas, and we huntin' you down
Representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
Bangin' out with the po-po, tryin' to get to some more
Street life, young strugglers racin' the clock
Ain't no tellin' when it all can end, roll a rock
That's the world with feelings, this a man's world youngin
The bitches in business, so learn a little something

Everybody's a gangsta, but don't put in work
Instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
And the streets ain’t got nothing for me but a hearse
I can't trust the church or the mobs, I can only trust God
And to tell you the truth I gotta ride
I only roll with the real
Cause rollin' with the fake got my loved ones killed

F*** ’Em All,Better Dayz,2002,"You a what? Bad Boy Killaz
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Hahaha, yeah, nigga, fuck 'em all!
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Fuck all you muthafuckers!
Ayo, Biggie, put your hands up!

Now, I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to mothafuckers when they scrappin'
Blast and watch 'em back up
Notorious Biggie killer, affiliation with Death Row
Niggas get their caps peeled back, fool, this the West Coast
Bitch, you misdemeanor, I'm raisin' hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, 
I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip ‘cause, bitch, I love to scrap
Mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines, writin' raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks
Now they all want to sue me, so fuck 'em all!

(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)

Now, could you picture my criminal status at its fuckin' peak?
Even the baddest be gettin' murdered in they seats
I'm addicted to these streets, like crack is to these creeps
Seein' visions of a prison, wake up screamin' in my sleep
Is there a heaven in this hell? A possibility of livin' well?
But if they killin' me, I get my stripes and whose to tell
Choosin' to sell, I'd rather die and be deceased
World mob figure addicted to these fuckin' streets

Now, put your muthafuckin' hands up if you's a rider (Ride)
Niggas ain't killers so they hidin' (Why?)
Fuck 'em all, touch 'em all; that's the way that we do it
Ride up, hop the fuck out, watch that bitch nigga lose it
Man, I'm as strong as this game, ya'll be knowin' my name
A young high strung thug nigga created by pain
Livin' my life in the fast lane, gettin' fucked by the past
Got my mind on my cash
And my next piece of ass, so fuck 'em all!

(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Nigga, we Outlaw riders
Don't give a fuck if you love us, we thuggin'

I got glad bags with enemies, cut up so they remember me
Soaked up in Hennessy, so they relatives know it's me
You can bet your last dollar, I'll dick 'em and holla
Ridin' these hoochies like they some heavy ass Chevy impalas
Jump up and get your ass shot up
For my profit pick my Glock up
I'm bustin' with self-defense, you see
Poppin' nobody got 'em, holla
Outlaw riders, mash up on the gas pedal
Vacate the scene, count the cash and stash the precious metal
Here come the coppers, the S.W.A.T. team and the helicopters
Them crackers is crazy, why? ‘Cause they'll never stop us
I watched Arnold Schwarzenegger bust somebody in a movie
Now I want to do it too, ooh, ooh
Niggas is too through, true to the game
I claim Outlaw riders, we give a fuck what they try, I'm…

‘Cause Young Noble behind it
Can you picture me stickin' niggas for they watch and chain?
Kick back, lil' nigga, and watch the game
Get your mob rocked and what-not
We keep it poppin', like a drug spot
The streets know what's hot, trust me

Even my hood call me ""baby Malcolm X""
With the TEC's, shower some slugs on 'em
I've got a brother, don't rest and he keeps some drugs on him
Always in grind mood, hustle to find food
Ever seen 
Faces of Death
? That's what my 9 do

I keep my mind on my money, and my money on my mind
With my back against the wall, like I'm runnin' outta time
Even rap with a gat, I must be goin' out my mind
Like I'm up against the world, this guerilla team of mine
Screamin', ""Thug Life, bitch, fuck 'em all!"" and die for 'em
Even if the last nigga left I'ma ride for 'em
Feel me? Until they kill me, that's how I'm rollin'
""Fuck 'em all, let them die!"" – that's my slogan; fuck 'em all!

(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Come put your hands up in the air!
It's a middle finger affair, yeah
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
I do my dirt all by my lonely
Don't need no phony homie to call me
(That's right, bitch, fuck 'em all!)
Back off, I hit at everyone of you homies
So don't get comfortable, I'm runnin' you

Fame,Better Dayz,2002,"And my niggas say
We want the fame!
Come on! Come on!

One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
The one thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
It's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame

Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame

Block run and shoot slugs
We throw them back like hardballs
Without the gloves, no love for these fake desperadoes
And thugs I bleed to envy
Smoke and blow out they blunts, sippin' Henny
Drunk nights, and hot days
Cockin' my heat, shootin' it sideways
A life on the run, full of common blunts
Unconditionally married to my gun
Fulfillin' my destiny on knees and one's desires
Be pullin' all my cabbage like priors, stuck in the trance
Searchin' for something higher, the fortune and fame

One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
Something we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
It's been nothin' but pain, stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame

Searchin' for fortune and fame, lost in the rain
A lost of the game, with life is the cost of the game
We forcin' the change, motherfuck flossin' a chain
All the blame belongs to the part of the brain
That we never use, nigga, plus my heart is in pain
And if I ever lose, homie, bet I'm at it again
Outlaws don't die, so united we stand
And if family come before, all the fortune and fame

As I walk up in the crib, laid to rest my head
Say salaam to the angels, hope they bless my bed
Hope they bless me the righteous way
Got a homie locked down outta town, I sent him a kite today
Man, that hate in your heart you gotta cleanse it, dawg
Prayin' for my downfall, and I can sense it, dawg
I was passed down the street fame
Like Glocks clocked and keep aim
Was raised up with a clock box
And I ran with the local street gang
They say the light is faded but still shine in the dark
You can easy been a man, but you's a boy in your heart
And that's some game that I got from generation of game
In the road of life, dog
We need to switch up lanes – think about it!

One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Been nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame

I can't complain, I've seen my fair share of the fame
It won't change me, now I've got this piece of change
I feel strange, I got so used to the hood
That when I finally got out at first it ain't feel good
I was just a baby, still retarded from slavery
When we struggle to shovel shit ain't nobody saved me
Ghetto ain't made me, I made myself
Poverty raised me, thinking ain't no help
I pray for my health, my mind, and my family too
State of myself, my grind, and my family crew
Where one hand washes the other
No, we ain't blood, but we still real brothers
The struggle is real, nothin' can steal what we build
And that remains the same 'til the day that we killed
And that's real, life that I was aimed to be
Love by my family tree, that's fame to me – how about it?

One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dyin' for
Nothin' but pain
Stuck in this game
Searchin' for fortune and fame",https://genius.com/2pac-fame-lyrics
Ghetto Star,Better Dayz,2002,"Haha
For all my niggas in the hood (yeah!)
Livin' the life of a ghetto star
(you know) You know how we do it hahaha
Makaveli

Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by
They shouldn't have tried me
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
Eat a dick, biyotch mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life (of a ghetto star)

I live the life of a thug nigga, drug dealer livin' game tight
Mug niggas, slug niggas for the fame life
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Street smart, proficient, intelligent
And keep suckers hittin' 'til snitches start smellin' it
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
Keepin' Channel 7 at work, filmin' different features
Leadin' niggas to an early death with they head blown
And to those who didn't make it to the morgue was just dead and gone
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck, rappers waitin' to get done in
Back tat at him we tossed his ass out
M.O.B. related, one mo' nigga found shot up with his dick in his mouth
Printed my name in these streets as a motherfuckin' G
Now the next generation's lookin' up to me like Cedric told em 

Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried, forgive me
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed, with acid
Two shots rang from the plastic Glock, wrapped in plastic
Buried the bastard, time to notify
His family, shit!, ain't nothing left to be identified
Evacuate the crime scene fast
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Fly, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Set up a shop selling them crooked cops marijuana
Label me a success, I made the switch
Retired from the life that never gave me shit
But cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star

Got the word that some nerds wanna plot on this
Hit the curve, let it swerve, had to stop they grip
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Straight to the morgue cause I plan on, shuttin' shit down
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
Death, apparently they wasn't sucka free
Cause I had all them wannabe thug niggas in protective custody
I guess they heard that I got them birds
Thought I was a nerd 'til I bucked one of them to the curb
Luxury livin' lavish, with dreams of dyin' rich
With a team and clientele on my mothafuckin' dick
And gettin' down on these snitch bitches, protectin' riches
By givin' stitches, the life as a ghetto star

When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star

This goes out to all you motherfuckers (to all you motherfuckers)
That STILL, have to kill to make that money (still, I'll be puttin' down)
All you niggas on the block, sellin' rocks
Hand to hand, runnin' from the police (sellin' motherfuckin' dopes)
(smokin' weed)
I see you
Live your life as a ghetto star
(look at these tramp ass hoes) Talk to the hood
Claimin' gettin' riches
(spank bitches ain't new)
Runnin' from new playa haters. (any fake ass niggas)
Live my life as a ghetto star

Niggas with two strikes that don't wanna see the third (nah), I feel you

Awaiting the much-anticipated release, of 2Pac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz
This is yet another posthumous release by 2Pac

So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how

I'm barely standin' and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin' through the street lights 'cause we like
Yo' nigga get your mob on show 'em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas or better yet like Reno
Niggas poppin', welcome to our casino 'cause you and me know
Hundred percent like a C-note
Lookin' for a bitch that's half-black and Filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some Indo
Tongue-kissin' out the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger while I'm diggin' I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type, love fuckin' bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say 'em right
The club be poppin' so I'm stoppin' at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try in the late night

Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain 'til my socks is damp
Ain't nuttin like bein' a thug when I can just
Sit on the Row of Death straight knowin' that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin' on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town
Last night was poppin' like like cocked Glocks with hollow-tip rounds

From booty-calls to bail sheets
It ain't no tellin' if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night
Probably involves me comin' up with just to see another day might be me who bites the bullet in these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryna burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin' my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggas gettin' crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin' my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin' Monday through Sunday
Bringin' the gun play for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'ma ride on that hide like cattle, cowards best to skedaddle
In the late night

""Last night.. last night changed it all""
""Last night..""
""I don't give a fuck, where you gon' be. Be home by eleven!""

Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggas in low-lows, pursuin' mo' hoes then go home
The life of a California star and when you see me
In the drop-top Jag', how many niggas wanna be me?
Game is automatic, mandatory I sell
To live or die, I survive, but with a story to tell
'Cause when you gettin' some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin'
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, must be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
'Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I disappear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
For my niggas up in Clinton gettin' weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin'

Where my real thugs, where ya at?!
Hehehe, send cases to the drug dealer
Real thugs, where ya at? You motherfuckin' home
Do it to 'em, do it to 'em
They love the way we do it to 'em, we do it to 'em

Suppress the revolution a premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
Got a law for raw niggas, now, playa what it be like?
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes?
Can't seem to focus hopeless, with violent thoughts I wrote this
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
And so I learned to earn my currency and over time
Affiliated, clearly click of military minds
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when my Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, wrath of the 2Pacalypse
Forever ghetto necessary picture food stamps
Outlaw Thug Niggas never left the Boot Camp


They called us for assignment, one of the squad's finest
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Says I'm responsible for black Smif-N-Wessun
Puttin likkle yout's in a military state of mind
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Cocoa Brovaz 'pon de borderline
Test de sound and ye dead same ti-ime

Man to man, I'm facin' the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin' my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Masked men, ninjas that surround me, ready to attack
I react swiftly, what father taught me sticks with me
Never forget the method, stick and move strictly
Shit be seemin' like it's closin' in
With no regrets I hold position
Cause I suppose I'm one of the chosen men

Picture being put in a position to move
And you can't move cause your move is blocked by the knight
At twelve o'clock, that's when the madness begins
So I start to focus in, my thoughts on the war
Cause the rule is the law, and the law that we live by
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Why try if ya body lie
By the block true soldier mentality, this is how we rock and roll
(This is how we ride)

Stick and move, time to show 'em how to make a move
Or get moved on, let's see who strong


In the gaze of the strange, where nothin stays the same
Where new faces come through with similar game
Now who you thought was them, really ain't
They catchin' deja vu's of the game people play
It's a call for readjustment, fine tune yo' position
You slippin' and trippin' 'stead of bobbin and dippin'
But never let this world of stress get the best of me
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi

What does it take, to get a break in the world of snakes
And dose who fake
Elimination I'm facin' destruction
Outlawed, so I duck and down, fo'-fo' is bustin', no one to trust in
Rushin' to the goal line
Catch a nigga beat him treat him like he stole mine
No swine I'm a soldier, soldier I control mine
Time to, take you, back into time - follow dis here

One way out, this black hole
For this black soul, shit is outta control
I'm fightin' for my position to be a fetus in this world I'm enterin'
And my face is sentencin' for repentance
Before my body was fully formed into a human
I was already consumin' weed
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
Maybe that's why in the 90's I drop G's when I drop degrees
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked
You didn't think Boot Camp Clik would link, with a Outlaw mind?
If you do you press rewind
And you can peep guerilla tactics in every line

Yeah, and this is how we do it!
Where my real thugs, where they at?
Let me, see my real thugs, now where ya at?
Won'tcha, see my real thugs, where ya at?
Let me, see my real thugs, where ya at now?
Where my real thugs, let me see, where ya at?
Tell me where my real thugs gots to see, where ya at?
Where's my soldiers - where ya at?
Where my, real soldiers - where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, where ya at?
Get yo' strap my nigga; where ya at, where ya at?
Where my soldiers at; where ya at, what ya at?
Getcha, thug niggas where ya at, witcha strap?
Where my soldiers at, where my true thug niggas
No longer drug dealers cause we now, thug niggas
Where my soldiers at, no longer drug dealers
Cause we now, thug niggas, let me, where my
Where my soldiers at?, put your pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at?, put yo' guns up
Tell me where my soldiers at?, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my, SOLDIERS, my true thug ROLLERS
Yes, it just doesn't quit, YES!
This is that real hip-hop shit YES!
Fuck what you heard
From the ghetto to the 'burbs, know we meant, every word
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Put yo' hand on the pistol, put yo' pistols in the air
Where my soldiers at?, where my soldiers at?
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
Where my SOLDIERS?, where my soldiers at
When Bob Dole and Delores Tucker wanna know
Where my soldiers at,

Never Call U B**** Again,Better Dayz,2002,"Whassup, boo?
Swear I'll never call you bitch again
You ain't fuck with me
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin' apologized)
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)
I'll never call you bitch again

Damn – gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
This life of sin done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin' needin' tissues, fightin' over childish issues
Swear I can't live with you; but without you, every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-itch, you
Always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin' with you
Though not the man of your dreams
My plan and scheme's to be rich like a king
And live my life trouble free, I see
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl, just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)

We came too far to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far, pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, hey)

I wake up early in the mornin', at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin', and now I'm gone
Tryin' to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out before them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin'
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin'
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, ‘cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

We came too far to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far, pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)

I know, I know, all that is dead though
I'm changed, I'm tellin' you
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up, ya know what I'm sayin'?
That was way back then

You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you a bitch again
Yea yea yea, ohhhhhhhhhh

Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you — can we make this work, boo?
I know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same
Waitin' to exhale while I'm sittin' in the county jail
Keep your head up, ‘cause things are gettin' better
My cellmate shed tears off your last love letter
Told him you would find a friend, so keep your eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss, but it's the sufferin' that I feel
Who can I trust? And if I bust, will she snitch?
Even though you ain't the type to trip, sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
Huh, I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude
Thanks for bein' there much more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again — believe me!

We came too far, to throw it all away
We came way too far, pretty baby
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came too far to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came way too far, pretty baby
To throw it all away, throw it all away baby

Through all my ups and downs
You always stayed around stayed around",https://genius.com/2pac-never-call-u-b-again-lyrics
There U Go,Better Dayz,2002,"I don't know why I be fuckin wit' you

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind? Times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal with
Tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
'Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil' trick on a mission tryin' to get in my p's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known ""drug dealers""
We don't love bitches and believe they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

There you, there you go, actin' like a ho
There you, there you go, actin' like a ho
There you, there you go, actin' like a ho
Actin' like a ho, actin' like a ho
Ho! See the word on the streets you're a
Ho! Just a groupie on a world tour
Ho! Now I found out for myself you're a
Ho! Girl you need to check yourself

These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a playa, so playa, I play her
Mine got hoes that got more hoes than me
So how I look, gettin' hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And a head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, bitch be lyin' too much
She be dyin' to fuck me, you be buyin' her stuff, ho

See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast, see
I been tryin' to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim
Straight through them spandex, don't front just name
Spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin' like H20, it ain't nothin' for me to say
Why you keep actin' like a ho? But there you go

There you, there you go, actin' like a ho
There you, there you go, actin' like a ho

Ho! Now I found out for myself you're a
Ho! Girl you need to check yourself

Uhh, when I first met her I told her I was busy all the time
Now she callin' me flippin' like she miss me all the time
How she don't even trip? She got a man at home
You need to stop chasin' dick bitch and raise your son
I'm like ""Damn!"" We can creep sometime
And you know I'm on the road for like weeks at a time
Girl you're thirsty, and stop callin'
While I'm workin' you hurtin' me, All this bullshit is irkin' me girl
But there you go

I blame it on yo' momma, she need to holla at you
Or should I blame it on yo' daddy for all the things that you do?
(Things that you do)
'Cause there you go, just like a ho, caught in the streets
Like givin' yo' number out to every nigga you meet
I'm tired of the games you playin', so stop playin' (ho)
You hear what I'm saying, you only good for parlayin'
I'm layin' down the rules, this a game that you lose
So the streets can have you baby, 'cause I stay on the move

There you, there you go, actin' like a ho (There you go!!)
There you, there you go, actin' like a ho (Actin' like a real ho)
There you, there you go, actin' like a ho
Actin' like a ho, actin' like a ho

And you don't wanna go to clubs no more and

That wasn't you that went out
You was just goin' out 'cause yo' friend was
Okay, so you was pissy drunk up in that nigga car
'Cause yo' friend wanted to get drunk huh?

They Don’t Give A F*** About Us,Better Dayz,2002,"Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured
And just looked at the whole situation
‘Cause once you look at it
You know, (really do)

They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
They don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody give a fuck about us
And when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

Some say niggas is hard-headed ‘cause we love to trip
Equipped with game so we bang with this thuggish shit
I see you tryin' to hide, hopin' that nobody don't notice
You must always remember: you're still a member of the hopeless
See, you're black like me, so you snap like me
When these devils try to plot, trap our young black seeds
Look it, cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin'
Lookin' for role models, our father figures is basers
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep
Niggas at the party with they shotties just as rowdy as me
Before I fear computer chips, I gotta deal with brothers flippin'
I don't see no devils bleedin', only black blood drippin'
We can change — what your mouth say?
I'm watchin' niggas work their lives out without pay
Whatever it takes to switch places with the busters on top
I'm bustin' shots, make the world stop
They don't give a fuck about us

Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone
Time to reflect on what you did, ‘cause they sayin' you wrong
I'm sure you had your reasons, dawg, I don't doubt ya
See, the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about ya
Or them five mouths you forced to feed, not includin' yourself
All you want is wealth, they perceive it as greed
So as you loaded up that MAC and continue to buck 'em
I was on paper, thinkin' they don't give a fuck about us

I'm seein' it clearer, hatin' the picture in the mirror
They claim we inferior, so why the fuck these devils fear ya?
I'm watchin' my nation die, genocide the cause
Expect a blood bath, the aftermath is y'alls
I told you, last album, we need help 'cause we dyin'
Give us a chance, help us advance, ‘cause we tryin'
Ignore my whole plea, watchin' us in disgust
And then they beg when my guns bust
They don't give a fuck about us

Now If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
Nobody gives a fuck about us
But when I start to rise
A hero in their children's eyes
Now they give a fuck about us

Now, all my homies got love for me
Down to catch a slug for me
Guaranteed to bleed deeply, now that's love
Shit, nobody else could give a fuck
If I'm tore down, from the floor down, six-feet deep in the cut
What the fuck done went wrong?
How long will I be mourned?
When I'm gone, same song, ain't gave a fuck all along
And who am I to blame 'em?
Just do or die through the rainin'
Since they don't give a fuck, I don't; feel what I'm sayin'?

Now, thug niggas die but multiply in doubles
Wrapped in plastic or closed casket for our troubles
Pressed in times, we busted, like bubbles
With the police, this nation's peace sent here to run you
Now look at what this crooked world has come to
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin'
Man, I still hustle, so I'm dyin' certain
So I spent your time in poor and workin', I see no reason
So I stay ballin' season to season
Why you stuck thinkin' that they give a fuck?

You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga, you're lyin'
‘Cause half of my niggas long gone
Buried in the dirt just for tryin'
Sometimes I think my block is dyin' and that is awful
To wake up to another day, shit ain't changed that's all fool
I wake up sweatin', dreamin', coughin'
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted
While I'm layin' in the coffin
The shit comes around so often; so tell me somethin'
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin'
Nigga, I been so through pain, go through the struggle
Doin' the same thing you did at my age, and that's hustlin'
On the edge of straight bustin'
Well, since you don't give a fuck, I be frontin'
And I'ma drink my Hennessy like it ain't nothin'

If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
If I choose to ride, thuggin' 'til the day I die
They don't gives a fuck about us
But while I'm kickin' rhymes
Kick it to their children's minds
Now they give a fuck about us
They wanna see us die
They kick us every time we try
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us
So while I'm gettin' high
I'm watchin' as the world goes by
‘Cause they don't give a fuck about us

This Life I Lead,Better Dayz,2002,"In this motherfucking life I lead, shit
A hell of motherfucking road blocks
And crooked cops
We still ride though
What side? Westside

I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways, ‘cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy Badass? Nigga, you scary
I've been knowin' you for years
We was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Them bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd, and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is
Homie got into a fight last night that killed his kids

In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

I ain't a killer but don't push me, dawg
For the family I'll send that ass straight to God
In this life I lead, I seen the most of my 23 years
When vision is blurry, the money is clear
Some of my peers eternally will sleep in a coffin
And when Nob' on the road, I'm extremely cautious
It happen that fast, split second you gone
At the top of my tombstone put ""Nob' was raw""
Outlaw 'til I'm under the floor, for Kadafi the Prince
I stack dough like I clocked all the bricks
With a watch on my wrist, dawg, I know the time these days
We Outlawz, we gon' die this way nigga (nigga)
We already in the history books, 'Pac made sure of that
Whatever you took, we takin' it back
You know it's all for the foundation
Outlawz, we still buildin' the Thug Nation; holla at ya homie!

In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die

When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

It ain't nothin' but in-between nuts, oxygen is gettin' hot
Got a problem, old fag-ass nigga, kick rocks
*Bin Laden* on the phone and that nigga talkin' crazy
I don't know who to blame, him or *Bush* for killin' babies
I'm a New Jerz' Devil, the street, creative rebel
Only got one shot to produce on every level
This is bags I must, go the max I must
Nigga, I came from not much, so money I clutch
Uh-uh, Napoleon the strength of the strong-arm
When they think they was in the right
I prove they movin' wrong
I'm a hardcore product of the ghetto
Been blessed fo' sho' to eat from out the ghetto
I maneuver, in the right lane, quick to push back brains
Switchin' to the left lane, I'm playin' my hands
And I'm plottin' on the fortune, it's gettin' hot and scorchin'
I'm diggin' like a scorpion that torture they enemies

In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

Now with this Outlaw lifestyle that I been introduced to
Money and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer
Steady seducin' us and now I'm all for it
This the life for me and the law can't spoil it
So you can call it what the fuck you want
But I'm a ballin' alcholic with a sawed-off pump
My momma ain't raised no punk; and neither did 'Pac
So when it jump off, I breathe for Yak'
Been puttin' in work, so I walk with a bop
And it ain't safe at home, so I sleep with a Glock (no mistakes)
Thug livin', uhh, what the fuck'd be better?
I do my dirt with the family so we dyin' together

We on a mission for mo', gangsta shit on you hoes
We ain't fuckin' with you most
Just crooks and niggas about they flow
Tryin' to live Godzilla
E.D.I. went from a Bad Boy to an anybody killer
Look out, wanted man, guns in hand, stand firm
Nuts and my pride, now let's burn
Bound to the fam going down swingin'
Holding my ground, now we the last ones breathin'
Won't stop until we even deep in the trenches
So many killings it's senseless
So in this life I lead, I stay protected
By God, my squad, and this thing in my palm
Now all my hustlin' motherfuckers, get your money, sing along

In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers 'til we die
In this life I lead, fiend for currency, get high off weed
Collect G's, make my enemies bleed
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
And watch 'em ride, Outlaw motherfuckers
'Til we die, in this life I lead

This motherfuckin' life I lead, nigga
You know what time it is

Whatcha Gonna Do,Better Dayz,2002,"Hell yeah (2Pac yawning)
Hahaha

And uh, I started out dumb, sprung off a hood-rats
Listenin' to the radio, wishin' that I could rap
But nothing changed, I was stuck in the game
'Cause everybody in the industry was fuckin' me, mayne
Listen, I got a scheme, break away, do my own thang
Drop some conversation, sit back and let the phone ring
Niggas ain't wanna see me rise
97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size
And if I catch another case, Lord knows how they hate me
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards livin' as a thug
Count my blessings and throw my stressings in this land with no love
Maybe they seen me rollin', look at all this green I'm holdin'
I get this why they envious and get they eyes swollen
Hopin' the heavenly father love a hustler
Meet the hardest nigga on the Earth to ever bust a nut
My homies tell me, ""Have a heart"" — fuck they feelings
I've been tryin' to make a million since we started, we cold hearted
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force
Empty out my clip, time to mash, they asked for it
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers, haha
Niggas talk a lot of non-shit I choose to ignore it
A war? They ain't ready for it haha

Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?
Tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?

My nine is Thug lord, my mind on my grind
Outlawz is my heart, they shine when I shine
My rhyme is my grind, my team be on role
Proceed with the onslaught, indeed they all talk
They all marks and it's an Outlaw holocaust
When I got the sawed-off, niggas gettin' hauled off
Yeah, nigga beware, stand clear
This nigga's scared, man, I don't really care
I've been lost love, my heart need a hug
My bite need blood, I fight with a grudge
The life of a thug nigga might need gloves
But you'll never know with a price on your mug
Them fight strips snug right around your hands
Makin' sure you can never grab the mic again
Dog, you fuckin' with a grown man
Can't I can't afford to lose
Where we from niggas torture dudes
So whatcha wan' do?

Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?
Tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?
Tell me now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you
What y'all gonna do?
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you

Haha, watch me clown, give me lovin' when I'm high
I'm a outlaw baby, I'll be thuggin' 'til I die
In my drop-top, double-R, life as a rap star
Hustle like a crack fiend 'til they catch me
Go ask somebody to your show
Watchin niggas out of sight, in my night scope
Cookin' white dope, got my nigga 25-to-life stressed out
Tryin' to have all the better things in life
While Makaveli — a born leader, 10 millimeter
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
Heed, from out the Bible I read
See the meek shall inherit the Earth and the strong will lead
Hittin' weed like it's alright
I'm in the studio makin' music all night
My enemies cry whenever I rise, they hated 'til the death
Tryin' to beat me out my last breath
Whatcha gonna do?

Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you (now nigga now)
What y'all gonna do?
Now whatcha gonna do, when my niggas come for you (throw you hands up)
What y'all gonna do?

Who Do You Believe In,Better Dayz,2002,"Let us pray, Heavenly Father
Hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me, who do you believe in?..
Who do you believe in?..

I see mothers in black, cryin', brothers in packs dyin'
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watchin' our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God ‘cause we livin' in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped
He laughed, pointed his pistol as the cop car passed, and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin' bigger
But can't figure what I'm cryin' for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies?
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy?
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin' fact, stay high, explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear? Reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin' nearer

Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?

Can't close my eyes, ‘cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
‘Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin' the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle, became a sinner
I make my money, and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to an outcast, unforgivin'
And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin' just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy
Not knowin' if I'm worthy
Livin' life thinkin' no man can hurt me
So I'm askin', before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me
Look at all the shit you did to me; my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame, will I change?
I'm askin'…

Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?

Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
‘Cause so far I done witnessed too many dead niggas in caskets
With they chest plates stretched, like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line
Holdin' down camp, still mashin'
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95, back in Yardsville stuck
With a three to five, if he don't act up
Now he realize, if you don't stay wise
Then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimies is snitchin', dimin', a stool pigeon
I talked to him; he said he didn't, my man said he did
In fact he's sure, ‘cause he just came home off of bid

Now tell me, who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God
Blessed and still breathin'
And even though it's hard
That's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin', I'm askin' the grievin'
Who do you believe in?

Who do you believe in?

Who do you believe in?
Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah? Or Allah?
Is it Jesus? Is it God? Or is it just yourself?
Definitely not to be imposed, being a demon
Because this is the joy of believin'
Man, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry, or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand that every man is his own man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you give the man
You know the man
And you gotta call yourself, because you are that man

Who do you believe in?

So many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
Catch them, mimickin' my style tryin' to talk this way
Impossible my posse droppin' you, we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the streets, check my pedigree
Bustin' motherfuckers it's the thug in me
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'

Changed Man (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"Shit, I'm a changed man
Ay, turn the lights out
Me and Big motherfucking Syke
Big baller 2Pac up in this bitch
Y'know how we swing this shit, look
(Niggas fucking with a changed man)

By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to 
Simon
, niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a balling cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The game plan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin' is

Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)

Million dollar plots
Birds and flocks is how I wanna live
It's hard to change after living so negative
What I give back is Mac's and packs and facts
And ever lasting game watch your back and stacks
Young macks stay the loc'est and keep the focus
Don't get ground to bow down nigga soak this, game
From a criminal element stay wide open
Bud smoking nigga trip, get to gat smoking
But keep hoping and praying, laying the foundation
Watch thieves, fake G's and perpetration
Imitation is lethal, stay true to the one's you love
Put slug's in these wanna be thugs
In these drugs, bud and alcohol
You make emergency call, to a down fall
After all they got Pen's for us, and our future kids
All the things I did, where's my cig's?

Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)

A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin' out
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin' to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin' on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin' until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggas
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggas
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the mass of smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin' with a changed man

Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)
Now you can ride with me, live and die with me (fuckin' wit changed man)
But no one understands, the ways of a changed man (nigga you fuckin' Changed man)

Everybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggas don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin' with a changed man
This fuckin' shit on Deathrow
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
Nigga you fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha..Nate Dogg up in this biatch you know that nigga ain't no muthafuckin joke

Fair Xchange (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"You want me to do what?
What is it?

Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery (I do you, you do me hahaha)
Fair exchange, fair exchange ain't no robbery (Everything's legal, baby, everything's legal)

A picture of perfection
The object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin', pullin' and twistin' I’m on a mission, got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin' when I did
Steady, yellin' out spots for me to hit, and ""aw shit""
Soon as I seen her, saw us playin' hide the weiner
Want a ""Freak Like Me"", fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holler out my name when a thug nigga ride, ""Can I cum inside?""
Say you don't feel it, that's a lie
You just scared to get this penitentiary dick
The trot caught your eye when I walked by, I said ""Hi""
But you were so shy, I can't lie, damn-near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it, and even worse
Got your heart set on me going first, and that ain't no fair exchange!

Fair exchange
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery (hahhaah, yeah nigga)
Fair exchange
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery (it's all legal nigga)

Open your legs
Got me marchin' like it's a million
, you tremble from the feelin'
Look up, 'cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
And if you willin', then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum 61 times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
'Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw your legs out the window
Remember on the balcony? Bend over baby, bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me? ""I Get Around,"" and I'm haunted by my ""Temptations""
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it 'cause you walk around actin' like you're perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin' me no favors, fair exchange!

Fair exchange
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery
Fair exchange
Fair exchange
Ain't no robbery

Now your attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true, I'm gettin' pussy, but baby you're gettin' dick
And since you're bein' laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
In bed naked you're so twisted think your legs breakin'
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last
Doggy style steady pumpin' on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait until you asleep and that's the payback
'Cause you're actin' like you did somethin', givin' me a piece
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin' bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange

Mama’s Just A Little Girl (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"To the young mothers
I feel ya, I know how it is
(Mama's just a little girl)
Don't nobody understand
I feel ya

She was born a heavy set girl with pigtails and curls
A heart full of gold, still it won't change the world
Though she could never understand why
Some underhanded plans witnessed a man die
Was only fifteen, should have been a beauty queen, still
See her cryin' by the caskets when her parents got killed
Little girl don't cry, 'cause even though they died
You can best believe they're watchin' over thee from the sky
Never asked for this misery, but look at what you're gettin'
It's a blessin' in disguise when you find out you're pregnant
No money, no home, and even though you're all alone
You gots to do this on your own, so baby gone
I wish you luck and if you need me, call
Just come to me and let me feed you all
I can understand the way it feels when you're fightin' the world
Facin' all this drama when Mama's just a little girl

And mama's just a little girl
(How old are you?)

At sixteen
What a beautiful thing, the very essence of a jet-black ebony queen
And who could tell she'd get pregnant at an early age?
She didn't listen, had sex, watch her belly raise
Hey, got violated by someone she dated
If this is fate, I'd hate to see the seeds she created, and so we waited
Though it takes time to build a body and a mind
She reclines nine months then finally it's time
What do we find? Little growin' boy of mine
With a tortured soul, addicted to a life of crime
Had no time for the growin' stage
He learned his values on the streets at an early age
Watch for police, don't come home, why?
'Cause Mama's actin' crazy at the hospital
'Bout to have another baby
Like a rose from the concrete, growin' within
Blessed with twins how the hell can Mama raise three men?
So we began, closest family, such insanity
A happy home, from one act of inhumanity
Plus Mama said the seed was corrupted
Used to rub her belly, beggin' us to breathe and she'd loved us
Now, Mama, sits quiet, sippin' peppermint Schnapps
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey)
How could Mama bring a thug like me in this world?
She ain't the cause of all the drama
Cause Mama's just a little girl

(Stupid motherfuckers don't know)
Mama's just a little girl
(How can she raise us?)

Now, will she remain in the same spot?
The gunshots rang, they came from the 'caine spot
Now, look here, I see her clutchin' her son in her arms, she's hurt
Her heart bleeds, now she watched her seed die in the dirt
Fulfilled prophecy
But who could stop the grief I walk around, tryin' to hold the world, up on top of me
I'd probably be an innocent man, still I'm the victim of a curse
What could be worse? Nothing but pain, since my birth
Only functions at the pen', 'cause everybody's in
Payin' back society, I'm guilty of a life of sin
I watch the drama occur, my eyes blur before I jetted
I wonder why we all have to die 'fore we get it
Though we shed tears, so many peers I've done buried
Worried and scared, knowin' I'ma see the cemetery
Must be prepared, in this cold world, no one cares
No! It ain't fair, but we all bear and do our share
In this land of the underhanded schemes and plans
Vivid dreams of a nigga havin' G's in hand
Mama told me not to be a punk
Fuck what you talkin' about, coward, what you niggas want? (hey)
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my Mama in this world
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha, you're just a little girl
(Hell nah, that's right)

See mammas just a little girl
(Mama's just a little girl)
Mama's just a little girl
Facing all this drama, 'cause mama's just a little girl

They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do
(Mama's just a little girl)
They wonder why we hold such little worth for human life
(Facin' all this drama, when mama's just a little girl)
To ask us why we turn from bad to worse
Is to ignore from which we came
(Mama's just a little girl)
You see, you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals
(Mama's just a little girl)
On the contrary, we would all celebrate its tenacity
We would all love its will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses
(We are the roses)
This is the concrete
(This is the concrete)
And these are my damaged petals
(These are my damaged petals)
Don't ask me why
(Don't ask why)
Thank God, nigga
(Thank god)
Ask me how

Never Be Peace (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked
, 
my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty, we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop
, 
I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
The promise of a better tomorrow ain't never reached me
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid, callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more
, ‘cause we all die for fun
So why you ask me if I want peace if you can't grant it?
Niggas fightin' across the whole planet
So it could never be peace

Will there ever be peace, or are we all, just headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
‘Cause there could never be peace

No time to rest, they stressed out
I can't remember the days my homie was here
Now a days we live in fear, the struggle still here
So now who's grabbin there strap, Who's gettin' burnt wild
Representin' the generation of killers when I was a child
Had many dreams, the reality kept me and my homie stressin'
Tryna' raise my baby girl to be the strongest
Knowin' I'm doin' wrongest
I never had a bright day
Just drunkless and smokin' blunts and gettin' pay day
Wishin' my partner made it
It was peace  was deceased I know there'll never be
All my tears were shed when i lost my homie number three
It's gettin' harder to see impossiblity should we just face it
Can't get through the pain but still I can't erase it
So many trials and tribulations, the things we facin'
Wicked days, can't see no brighter days, it's time to chase it
Cross dreams 'cause the scene is when you never get by
That's why I gotta stay high, you never know when you die
My heart'll never leave the ghetto I know to rise only in peace
That's why I say, there ain't never goin' to be no peace
End

So will there ever be peace
Or are we all just headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool there'll never be peace

Livin' like lonely, but I can't even cry
'Cause visions of deceptions all around, got my eyes full of despise Who can I trust, why even try
They say the world is mines, but I know it's a lie
Livin' to die, set up from birth, steady dreamin'
Wishin' for better days, but all I see is daemons
Close my eyes and remenise of my childhood
But all I felt was pain for my arrival
No memories of nothin' nice
Nothin' but blinder reminders of my future life
I'm freakin' out, I'm gettin' closer to that other level
Will I be strong with game or just a heartless devil
I hope I'm able to find peace in me
'Cause there is Storm 64 inches deep in me
And I try to do the right, but it's the wrong things
That seem to bring me right back to this dirty game
There'll never be peace

Fuck peace!
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Fool, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace, or are we all just, headed for doom?
Still consumed by the beast?
And I know there'll never be peace
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
Nigga, there'll never be peace
Will there ever be peace?

Shit, fuck peace!
On the strength 'til my niggas get a piece, we can't have peace
How the fuck we gon' live happy when we ain't got nothing?
You motherfuckers are smilin', but I'm mean muggin'
Why? ‘Cause I gotta be thuggin'
It seems drugs done turned this whole mothafuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass motherfuckin' adolescents
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more
How the fuck can you have a childhood
And you at the funeral every motherfuckin' weekend?
Pssh, and you motherfuckers talkin' about peace?
Nigga, it ain't no motherfuckin' peace
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? You ain't heard?
Lil' babies gettin' smoked, motherfuckers killin' they whole family
Lil' kids gettin' thrown off buildings
Motherfuckers gettin' abused
Peace? Nigga, is you out your fuckin' mind?
Fuck peace! We can't never have peace
'Til you motherfuckers clean up this mess you made
'Til you fuckin' clean up the dirt you dropped
'Til we get a piece, fuck peace!

Still Ballin’ (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"Straight motherfuckin' ballin'
Part two, still ballin'
Kurupt up in this motherfucker
Westside!

Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin
Ridin' on these niggas 'cause they lame
In a 6-1 Chevy, still heavy in this game—can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug nigga
Up before the sunrise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggas, hit 'em up, WESTSIDE
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger, Lord forgive me if I smoke niggas
I love my females strapped, then fuck her from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggas wonder why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry? Hell nah, nigga tears shed
For all my homies in the pen', many peers dead, nigga

Still ballin, 'til the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin'

This for all y'all motherfuckers
They done did it, let the dogg out the cage
I'm pumped dump with the gauge
I done did it all, everywhere I go, I ball
Precise, keep my game tight, or for sure I fall
I'm the invincible, and since the top principal's loot
Like the Heat to them all, who got the heart to shoot?
I get stitches, play the game of BB Britches
When I was young, dreamin' 'bout money, fame, and bitches
I like fat asses, fat money bags of cash in masses
Slowly as time passes, I found nothing but money rules time and space
And in this realm of thoughts
Where all the fucking murders take place
And I'm in it to win it; I'm out to get paid
Got all these bitches on my dick from all the money I made
It's a trade I've acquired, growing up inspired
Naturally, I don't give a fuck, a murderer for hire
Still ballin'!

Still ballin, 'til the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin', niggas wonder why
You can bring your crew but we remain true, motherfucker
Still ballin'

Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page, shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggas holla out my name and it's similar to Raid
Motherfuckers know I'm comin', so they runnin' to their graves, watch
Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
'Cause Kurupt don't give a fuck, where you coward niggas now, blast
Keep pumpin', ain't worried 'bout nuttin'
Busters thought we was frontin', so reload and keep dumpin'

I feel heat, everywhere niggas see me up in the streets
I don't tweak, keep a straight .38 under the seat
Mash, mission mode, my thoughts are cold
Plots and plans for scams, money bags of gold
Roll and collide, homicide vibes inside
Thug Life and Dogg Pound on this midnight ride
Ever since we hit the Row
We got stationed, with no hesitation
Make moves, nigga, Mr. Too Smooth, the elaborate
You're slow like motion, focus on the money that's made
And sip on this poisonous potion
Glamour get you got, too much heat, too hot
Get shanked, get shot indulging in this poisonous plot
Fame and fortune, fortune from game
Weed and zags, illicit amounts of cash
Jags, it's all the same, ain't shit ever gon' change
As long as there's money to exchange, NIGGA!",https://genius.com/2pac-still-ballin-original-version-lyrics
U Can Call (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"Who should I call?
No I ain't callin' her
No I ain't callin' her
Oh yeah, her

Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile
To my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed; you got me
Inhalin' the aroma of your perfume, and feelin' heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin'
My lyrics are poetry, so baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you know it's me
It's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
Layin' butt-naked on the beach kickin back relaxin'
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I wanna make you mine
I'm kissin' on you tryin' to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin' at the walls
Withcha number in my hand, wonderin' should I even call her tonight

When the road get's rough
You can call me up
(You can call me up)
When it's all too much
You can call me up
(You can call me up)
When the road get's rough
You can call me up
(You can call me up)
When it's all too much
You can call me up

Been gettin' nuttin' but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us havin' breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin' love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin'
Come get a shot of this playa dealin' and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to rush up
Beware of the fireworks, cause every time we touch..
.. it's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin' my fingers through your hair
If you call me

When the road get's rough
You can call me up
(You can call me up)
When it's all too much
You can call me up
(You can call me up)
When the road get's rough
You can call me up
(You can call me up)
When it's all too much
You can call me up

Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the Hyatt , if it feel right
My only wish is to be witcha
You got me steady strivin' to getcha
Fantasizin' of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin' major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin' wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places
What will it take? cause the heartache be heatbreak
Is my prediction when you falsify and start fake?
In my position I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?

When the road get's rough
You can call me up
When it's all too much
You can call me up
When the road get's rough
You can call me up
When it's all too much

Ghost,Tupac: Resurrection,2003,"The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine

You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?

Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so goddamn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, kill a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
And then we'll be ghost

Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby

One Day At A Time (Em’s Version),Tupac: Resurrection,2003,"Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screaming
‘Cause they seeing destruction before they see a human being
So they start smokin' weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
‘Cause they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly? Somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hoping, please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies

We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
‘Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays
And the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
And I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search, but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
 And we continue growin', one day at a time

Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Kadaf' while Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun, ain't no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died and came back, would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains the same

I spend my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And hey, now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin' for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive
I'ma die a man, still standin' and in love with my pride

Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ASCAP
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes, I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
 And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn",https://genius.com/2pac-one-day-at-a-time-ems-version-lyrics

{Gun cocking} Let me know, holla {Gunshot}

There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see
That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future

Yeah nigga! Haha
Let's go nigga, this is what it is
2Pac cut his head bald
Then you wanna cut yo' head bald (You pussy nigga!)
2Pac wear a bandanna
You wan' wear a bandanna
(What do we have here now?)
2Pac put a cross on his back
You wanna put crosses on yo' back
Nigga you ain't 2Pac
 - This 2Pac!

Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell-bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained
Military mind of a thug lord, sittin' in the cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence, calling to Jesus
Balling as a youngster, Wondering if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listening?
Got my, hands on my semi-shotty, everybody's listenin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

'Till Makaveli returns, it's ""All Eyez On Me""
(What do we have here NOW?)
And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be
You should've listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see


Now since you're crying for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nothin' left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (now) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
God made men the same boy, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playing with guns
While your momma had your punk-ass playing tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly-hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck The Source, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone

Black Cotton – a symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tale
Ghetto gospel, that is, listen!
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak!

Black cotton, steady stressin', Smith & Wessons, count my blessings
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave?
Never got paid but still we slave (in the nine tre')
Answer that, then answer this too
Love's gonna get ya, you know it's true – life's a bitch, true?
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter, G? Black cat got your tongue?
Fat track got you sprung, now you're hung?
Do ya feel me? Dum dum diddy, is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace, then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seein' bodies on the streets deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies – POOF!
We used to have troops, but now there's no more youth to shoot
God, come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (in God's eyes)

Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my dreams
Drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care (Feels like I'm pressed
Why do I stress? It's like I'm bein' tested)
Nobody don't care (Seems like my prayers
Vanished in thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care

In the belly of the beast I'm bubblin' up
Runnin' out of luck, about to self-destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her with your one-day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool, but it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know, I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did to us baby kids
And now we grown up, nobody ain't own us yet

Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit, they shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin', but keep in mind, it ain't irkin'
And we ain't stop, it's curtains
You try to rise and certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridaz
What's the reward for a struggler?
If the law lovin' us, then why they hate to see us comin' up?
Runnin' up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove, no love
Waitin' for my 40 acres and a blunt to blaze
Biblical times, good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton – I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton – I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine

Nobody don't care (No matter how hard I try
Look to the sky, and I ask God why)

Niggas just wanna know
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass nigga shit

Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47 layin' on my hips so I don't trip
One mothafucka from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch, the mothafuckas got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin' the finger at police
Instead of them mothafuckas blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk mothafuckas get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do

I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at each other (fuck no!)

And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine draft, guns and ganja and my fucking TEC-9
They know their scared to see us sober (awwwww)
Stop drinking King Cobra, and niggas will take the world over
It’s all up to you (up to you)
Blame the Korean blame the Jew (fuck that)
Or be a crooked nigga too

It's all up to you, but until then I gotta do what I do

Why me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin' to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So mothafucka make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop; 
see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy

You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm goin' crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous, give me space, it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get third degree
Where you been and who you wit', I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
You're suspicious I deceive, gimme grief without belief
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me, and support that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?

Callin' at my house then hangin' up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're sayin' I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead, you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me?
Instead, I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin'
Fightin' back the urge to just start cryin'
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?

You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?
(not that I don't trust you)

I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional, you know me
Comin over cryin' just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie
This time I'm breakin' out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
And I can give you more when you mature
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya!
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin'
Not because we rushed it
Don't you trust me?

You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me?

Threw the sack to his lil' niggas workin the set

Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line, my two nines
Go baya baya when I shoot 'em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My Niggas! Straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cuz we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man
But nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas

As long as you usin' them thouroughly
Muah til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably will ever be
And i'm a product of the '70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin' with you, i'm probably beefin' with you
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin' with you
I know you got a gun but i'm hopin' you keep it with you
Cuz unfortunately, i'm one of them rappers that keep a pistol and
You know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath
Ruff Ryders, D-Block, and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you
Probably cuz of the way you used to bring the drama to
Whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway, life goes on
So i'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do

Cause I'm out on motherfuckin' bail
Y'all ain't never gon' see me in this motherfucker again!
Drop that shit L G
Let these ol' punk-ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit for the '94
Niggas ain't goin' back to court, you stank ass bitches

I'm stuck in jail, the D.A.'s tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail, if I had a good attorney
Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up - I ain't trippin'
In the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin', they askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep! they takin' Polaroids
And I'm tryin' to use the phone, but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my Glock, cause it's major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastic in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone, that's my word
'Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' co-llect calls to my ol' bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshit bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutter, I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug, I was raised in jail, now I'm out on bail

Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential

I'm stuck in jail, and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail, if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark when I start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it, hey
And sellin' product to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I got a lot of love
Hangin' out with the O.G.'s, shootin' up the clubs
And momma told me, don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me, then it's on g
Got me sittin' in a cell, a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven?
Got my bitches on the outside, writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me, and the shit'll get better
I don't believe 'em cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your picture's on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets, I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous, I'm on bail

Dealin' with you scandalous bitches
Y'all need to pop some of these crooked ass motherfuckin' judges
But here go the motherfuckin' fetti, I'm out on bail

Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And OPD can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me
I ain't bust, but now I'm touchy, trust me
Ain't nothin' jumpin' but these buckshots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem
Now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold a
Motherfuckin' soldier, ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' ‘cause there's no stoppin' till they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunition's and them bitches will be dead soon
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryna keep a nigga down, but shit fails
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped — I'm a soulja!

I bet you that I got something you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon

Hurry up 'fore she spank shit

Make 'em pray for the Judgement Day

My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why? I stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Who's runnin' these streets? I said that cocaine

This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, releasing up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rearview, thinkin' 'bout the payback
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if I'ma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle fingers up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let 'em
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget 'em
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret 'em
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends and the felons

Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?

I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in your head that I'm making love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax ‘cause, baby, right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me

First 2 Bomb (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2004,"One love to my homeboys, death to my enemies
Bad boy killaz, Outlaw muthafuckin' Immortalz
You know what time it is
When we ride (when we ride)
Thug niggas 'til the day we die

Tell me baby, what's your frequency?
You see I'm makin' proposals that's full of verbal indecency when ya meetin' me
Flash light I'm buzzed, wasn't right like drugs
Got three strikes, you got these last nights for thugs
Holdin' my position, my competition is never ready
Ripped like a machete, my alias Makaveli
So what they tell me through the grapevine
Niggas ain't tryin' to see me paid, they rather take mine
Retaliation takes time
Create rhymes that so ferocious that the bass line
Went for my vocals every time a nigga say his rhyme
Spendin' and bustin' you thought it up, but you wasn't prepared
Nigga get scared, I'm eternally thuggin'
Like kamikazes on a suicide mission
I'm spittin' multiple gunshots burnin', turnin' rappers to victims
I kick 'em all day
And my motto, make Biggie Smalls pay
I make it ruff enough, you and Puffy crawl away

First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye
First to bomb, right out the gate nigga fuck your size
Outlaw Immortal my nigga, when I see you eye to eye

First to bomb, quick to unload
Expose my foes for being bitches
Keepin' niggas suspicious
Two Glocks is full of ammo
My army fatigues ready for battle, lyrical commando
Lets get it on
Tell me nigga, how much you can handle
Bangin' on wax, I turn this track into a roman candle (boom)
My intention's specifically, thugged out no sympathy
Pictures of closed caskets, soon as Daz's get wit' me
I'm first to bomb, first there's the calm then the panic
Soon as my niggas break, we earthquake the whole planet
Adversaries can't understand it
The way my niggas strategize
Don't nobody die unless we planned it
Life long committed, I write songs to spit it
No matter how hard muthafuckaz try, they can't get it
It's Death Row
Westside, Outlawz 'til we die, thug life
Muthafuckaz on the ride and we

Ain't nuthin' nice right here
I get the poundin' from the drum, that's how I overcome fear
Give me your soul out ya life, hand it to me like I'm Christ
I look at death to be nice, I wanna try it some nights
And I swear to God, I get medieval on your bastard catch wreck
Mama told you to knock me out, but you ain't knock shit yet
You wanna bet, I make the bitch come straight outta you
Claimin' you mobbin' deep, with your pity ass crew
Don't let me tell you what some real ass niggas would do
If you a soldier, ask ya homie could it be me and you
Head up first, I'll kill your work, I got you lost so you hurt
A flurry combination then I leave your dick in the dirt

Nigga, I leave you shell shocked
From project streets to cell blocks
Glock 45 with the tail cocked
Makin' jacks by no means
Pocket full of crack and money stacks in my jeans
Wildin' on ya street high off codeine's (codeine's)

Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
Busta, you ain't heard?

Slap you cock-eyed like Popeye fucks spinach
Forgotten more shit than most crews ever know, or ever knew
Was born with 7 flows and only heaven knew
For beat the boot sex, the news breaks, the you shakes
Worse, they heard we got more nerve than a 2-fake
Yoo-hoo to you crew and you too so you knew
I'm from Jersey and I'm a teen so your block more than you do
Whose the new crew?
Show me your neck brotha, and here's another
Smack your mother's mamma's mother
In the first mob of all those other crack lovers
Back was bitch-ass, trick ass, cluk-clow-cluk-clow
How ya like me then, how ya like me, hey-ho, how ya like me now?
Ow, pow, hurt, don't it? Bow, bow, don't run up on it
The same thing minus ""P"" hangin possies like an exponent
Oh yes, rock in slums, ya gots to run it

Poppin after poppin the fools be droppin, the hoes be hoppin
On my thing cause it hangs like the nets from Above the Rim
You lookin grim, is it me or him or him
Or be with me, we be together
So what's up? We can do whatever
Cause real niggas stick together
Till they make it up to heaven
Through the stress, through the hell, through the 1-8-7
The shorter the nigga, the bigga the trigga
The deeper they dig the ditch-a
The Naughty the Treach
Then through to the Pac I brings the Glock I wets up
You fuckin body, I'm like, Oh my Gody
Did I really shoot him? Yo I shot him
So I got him, now I puts the crime behind me
And finds me, a place to lays my head low

Thugz Get Lonely Too (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2004,"See, it ain't easy being me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to what you do and keep the game up
'Cause thangs change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin' to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard but I'm strugglin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothing like trying to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shaking at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew

Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(You know)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too

I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I'll whisper thangs in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me from far away, or can you hear me
It seems to me that you're jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and making money with the fellas
In the back streets tryin' to track me, baby, hold up
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
'Cause your attitude has changed and you're actin' a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hanging up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy, baby, call back
Leave, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too, you know

Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(You know)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too

I sit alone in my room drinking, without a care
Talking out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man, it's on
You're the first face I wanna see, when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you, sink and see
It's in your head that I'm makin' love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax, 'cause baby right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear, baby, tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react to let me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm givin' to you is so true
And thugs get lonely too, you know

Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And no matter what I do)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(When I'm hangin' with the crew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(I thought you knew)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(And no matter what I do)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(You know)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Yeah)
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too
(Thug Life, baby, steady thuggin')
Thugs get lonely too, thugs get lonely too

Ay, so you remember that next time you sweatin' me when I'm on the road, baby
Thugs get lonely too, we ain't gotta go through all this bullshittin' ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me

I'm livin' that, thug life baby!
Steady smokin' Indo, goin' crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark, do you love me?
Everybody's talkin' 'bout they know me
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin' homies
Tell me what you need when you see me?
And we can get it on, biatch, take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number, baby, call me when you're lonely
'Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high 'til I die and strapped with my .45
'Cause you can lose it in the gutter
I wonder if I'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in
Thug for life, nigga ballin'
I'm gettin' tired of these hoes tryna play me
You can't fade me and my niggas goin' crazy
All day long I'm straight thuggin', and constantly mean muggin'
Breakin' the bitches that be buggin', tell me who do you love?

Maybe it’s the thug in me
Maybe it’s the thug in me
Maybe it’s the thug in me
Maybe it’s the thug in me

Check the lingo, the mack, straight packin' the gangsta dick
And when they come to help these skins, I'm quick to hit
While I hit it and quit it and let the next man get it
I'm pimpin', ain't no time to be committed
Hoes go catch a fit, 'cause I'm chocolate and loveable
Gangsta funk 'em with a dick that's huggable
Then I slide off without a trace
Unless she's worth, or let me nut on her face
What the fuck just make my dick jump
Wreck when I mack connect up in her rump
Hoes, they love it when I bone 'em but hate when I disown 'em
They buggin' off the skills that I show 'em
With a nigga named Stretch
It's all about lootin' if ya frontin' then ya get the boot, word up
So listen to the rhythm of a Young Gun flow
And tell them who you love when the hoes stroke

Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me

Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin' drugs
And runnin' from the narcs when they pass by
Don't ask why, I'm a hustler, 'til my ass die
Even if I do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all
Fuckin' with them tramp ass sluts who supposed to fall
Said she played you for your money, but the shit was cool
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you all up in the skirt
Now you lookin' like a jerk 'cause she hurts you
Now hands up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game
Keep your mind on your money, watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot, who do you love?

Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me

Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth 'cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts
‘Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined; my ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me

I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last

Without the sound of guns

Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bag but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel His hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thang
But am I less holy
'Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me
(Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold

Let's be friends, no need to front, let's be friends
Because I know you want to fuck

I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass, got me checking for you hardcore
Staring and watching, me and you one on one
Picture countless options, was it prophecy
Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, would possess my body
Far from a crush, I want to bust your guts
And touch everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweating like a fat girl going for mine
Just a skinny nigga's fucking like she stole my mind
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in nine-six, fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch, 'He can kiss my ass'
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs, now let me in-between as friends


Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Was it me or the fame, my dick or the game
Bet I scream 'Westside' when I came, Westside
Scream my name because, baby, it's delicious
Got a weak spot for pretty bitches
Up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby, let your back dip into it, make it fluent
In and out, all around when a nigga do it
You've got me high, let me come inside
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride
Who wants to stop me, am I top notch
Fuck player-hating niggas' because they cock block
You'd probably hate to see a real thug with vision
What's the game, rather see a nigga up in prison
Why have you changed
Made a living out of cuss words, liquor and weed
A bad seed turned good in this world of G's
Baby's got me fantasizing, seeing you naked
It's a fuck song, check the record, so check my record

When they think I'm wearin' Red I'ma rock the green

Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sittin' clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

No way no how we got to keep movin'
And puttin' it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not

I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggas don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep goin'

Dumpin’,Pac’s Life,2006,"Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

Murderous mind state, can't keep my 9 straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw ridaz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons, labelled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed, roll with thugs and dogs
Commence to lettin' off rounds then escape in the fog
Who wanna see me solo? Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My 
Mini-14
 murderin' niggas while they creepin'
Uh, duck or you ass out, drink 'til you pass out
Ain't scared to die,
 
drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories, nigga, now they wanna really see
""Bomb first"" my motto,
 it's fully guaranteed
Niggas is playa haters, label them my enemies—I'm dumpin'

Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some ""Uptown Anthem"" shit
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure here, I been here before
Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there
.40 cal's, extended clips, 
still I ain't scared
Outlaw and best believe they won't take me alive
I'm different and I'ma prove it if it take me to die
Knew that God had a plan for me
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me
Maybe I'm breezy or paranoid than a bitch
Me dyin'—you think I'd let them see the joy from that shit?
Walkin' dead, angels spend they last days by me
New Jersey giant like Dave Tyree
Young George and Jonathan Jatt
Your guns clap, mine'll go brraaatt, 
soldier like Geronimo Pratt
And come through cockin' the black pound
When they put the Twin Towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' them back down
Poster child—cheque!
Air Force Ones with the crocodile checks, I'm supposed to wild sex
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil
G ridin' with extra boxes of bullets to the 9 and the shovel

Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this

I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box ‘cause them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatch you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
The flesh to the bones, the bones to the ashes
But I'm not dead, I'm actually in a session
With the Pac keepin' the shot money, progressive
They don't really want no drama, I know your goons
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound
This God-given, he keep givin' me better music
So every time you hear me my songs present improvement
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', songs are evolution
If I load your gun for you when we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'—I'm clever, stupid!
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
You got the same bullets that you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
Papoose, Fatal and Pac—the revolution

Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this",https://genius.com/2pac-dumpin-lyrics

In and out the mouthpiece, until I cum, no one can stop me
My bump 'n' grind'll do ya every time
Come get a blast of this thug passion, it'll blow your mind
Hey! Throw up your legs, wrap them shits around my back
It's a Westside thing, fuckin' hoes around the map
Walkin' down 125 while I'm peepin' out hotties
And they, seduce my Jimmy, I'll be screamin', ""Give me body""
Make 'em all scream my name out, give me my props
And don't ya, love how this thug nigga beat up the cop
I'm at the Rican parade, I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas, bullshit ll never get you paid
This is the dream of a young black teen
I fiend for hoes cross country like a greedy crack fiend

Bang, bang, I'm getting bread on the proper
Private jet, anywhere I tell him he gon' fly to
My respect had these girls saying, ""Daddy I do
Anything you ask,"" get it crackin' when I slide through
As God as my witness, right hand on the bible
In Tokyo, honey turned it up, arigatou
Got stroked fa sho, now up in Atlanta in the strip club
She thick, cuz, took me to the SWATS, where the crib was
Went full throttle, got it crackin', I ain't bashful
From the kitchen to the countertop, in the bathroom
Flips mo', trips mo' stamps on my passport
Told her drop me off at Hartsville, I'm international

So of course I'm ready to get it, feel it going down right now
Hopped in the whip, popped the bottle, lit a blunt right now
Did about a buck-fifty, seconds later, the party right now
We celebrating Makaveli - 2Pacalypse Now
Escape through the front door, they shootin' up on tippy toes
Cruisin' up to get the dough
If you lose a chick then let her go
She done chose, it's over, bro
Look around, it's Harleyville
Dimes in high heels came from Japan to go to Cali to chill
They choosin' for real with no grill in my dental
Peep, my swagger tremendous, make moves monumental

Started with five shots, niggas plottin' to kill him
Never figured that that same nigga sell five million
Hit the charts like a madman, nothin' but hits
Court cases got a nigga facin' multiple digits
Dodgin' cop cars, look at how we come so far
Picture a high school drop-out roll in a double R
House full of happiness, weed and drank
Way out, so when trouble tried to find me – can't
Never visioned livin' longer than my twenty first
Thought I'd be locked down, cracked out, or in the dirt
And though it hurts to see the change, it comes with the fame
Watch them gossip in this silly game
To all the motherfuckers speakin' down on me, this is the night
Why's everybody caught up in Pac's life?
To all y'all niggas conversatin' on my life
Mind your motherfuckin' business!

What's happenin', Pac? Yeah, I know we never got to meet
But we know all the same people so we got to speak
You taught me first: fake niggas can't stop a G
And all the shit you went through meant a lot to me
But when they locked you up for nothin', it was a shame to see
You know the crackers came, they did the same thang to me
I get along with real niggas, it's the lane to be
Talkin' loud out of pocket tryna bang with me
And so I pull it out my pocket, let it rain, you see
Now they all in the courtroom, blamin' me
See, we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle
Power to the real niggas, death to the suckers
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em
Death before dishonour, never talk to undercovers
Live by the same rules, so minus the tattoos
We the same sort of dude with the same short fuse

My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major weight 'cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em weary
While you frontin' like you Billy Badass, nigga, you scary
I been knowin' you for years, we was high school peers
In Junior High I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin' niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
Bitches die in a hurry, still I ride, I'm never worried
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride, and I'ma ride
Pick my enemies out the crowd,
 
and motherfuckers die
It's not the way I wanna live, my nigga, it's how it is

Playa Cardz Right (Male),Pac’s Life,2006,"This going out to all the females that be having
To beat them motherfuckers in they head to get them
Off of them, Haha

Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin' pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin', take you any place you wish
Today we're satisfied, yesterday we've stolen kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding the destiny, had they planned for me?
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin'
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven cause bein' here ain't livin'
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin' for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you play your cards right

Play your cards right baby, haha, play your cards right
Play your cards right girl, take ya time
Take your time baby, be patient
Just be patient baby, don't rush
Don't you rush it girl

Uh huh, Luda
You ain't gotta do that baby
It's not the hand that you're dealt but how you playin' your cards
You got a brother feelin' mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin' like a playa, stop chasin' the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin', no rushin', just takin' it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, baby girl
You made me hurry up and wait and I know patience is a virtue
Haha, play your cards right baby

Play your cards right baby, haha, play your cards right
Play your cards right girl, take ya time
Take your time baby, be patient
Just be patient baby, don't rush
Don't you rush it girl

You're the one, the only one heaven sent for me
Baby, I'm hopin' that you understand, that you still believe
That I got the special times, on my mind, just hopin' that you see
Baby that the thug in me is lovin' you, that this is meant to be
Girl I'll never leave you alone
You're the one, the only one heaven sent for me
Baby, I'm hopin' that you understand, that you still believe
That I got the special times, on my mind, just hopin' that you see
Baby that the thug in me is lovin' you, that this is meant to be
Girl I'll never leave you alone

Play your cards right baby

Scared Straight,Pac’s Life,2006,"Fuck all these motherfucker's talking all this old bullshit
Like niggas just gonna accept that old trash ass shit
We ain't having none of this old shit
These niggas about to come up straight short
'Cause we about to get buck wild on you motherfucker's

Prepare for the wrath, a psychopath when this song play
Get iller than Johnny Gill, then rub you the wrong way
Fuck sensitivity I get cruel when you're doing me
'Cause none of the rough stuff bitch stop pursuing me
So true to the game, it's a name you don't dare say
A lyrical lunatic when I kick it you're scared straight
Motherfucker's fall pray to the roster
You step any closer and get hit with a dose of
The iller-fied pimping-ass gang to bang to
And I ain't ashamed to, get wicked with slang too
Niggas know, when I flow, I can give you mo'
Get sicker than psycho, and won't let the Mic, go
'Til I hear the whole crowd on they two feet
As I go through new beats, I'm running through MC's
Nigga please you dizzy, you can't take me
You stumble through break beats but you'll never fade me
Scared straight 'cause you hate, when I motivate
You suffer a different fate, with music I mutilate
But some of the super suckers try to stop me
I'm gunning and running the stupid motherfuckers now they jock me
What if I should trip? Or chill and a give fair break
Fuck it they feel the wrath of a motherfucker scared straight

You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (Ah, yeah, scared straight)
'Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (When your heart's beating)
'Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head

Feel the 'Fever In The Funk House' buster you'll get rolled on
No matter how much they bring, I duck and dodge and hold on
Best a watch the swing
Nigga the game is so strong, catch me by surprise
You won't realize your ho's gone
Nigga I'm on the creep
And if I know your address, girls as good as stuck
She eating my Mr. Badness
Pac don't give a fuck, I got too many enemies
Fucking with the ginger juice the booze of fucking Hennessy
The closer they can get
But still don't let them see me sweat, suckers ain't trying to step
They know they'll be breathing they last breath
Niggas ain't got no heart, but swear that they be rocking shit
'Til they get a load of the bold ass 2Pacalypse
Tell them to bring the noise, and look like they wanna rift
Brother this is ain't a game, a crook's what's you're fucking with
Hitting him with the flurry, I'll bury him if he steps to me
Suckers can't get next to me, tripping off some Ecstasy
Literal life insanity, even a form of suicide
This ain't BBD, try doing me you're do or die
Dropping them like a Mack, and smacking them like a weak bitch
Nigga don't even twitch
'Cause them I'ma have to pull the switch
Victory to the switch, so fuck 'em if they, try to break
Freaking 'em with the funk left them drunk
Hella scared straight
Hell yeah
Scared straight

Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep

Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on

Pictures of penny, sippin' my glass full of Henny
Hands on my semi—automatic kill for pennies
Approach for contact, 'cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire, niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say, we murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the crack out, my lyrics never fail me
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Niggas pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy me, it’s fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war, livin' sucka free, get wit' me

Seein' dreams in they sleep

I'm starin' through my rear view, doin' 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal, so I can't see what's behind me
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go
They close down the projects the clubs been closed
And then they wonder why niggas breakin' down o's
I'm a run away slave
Ya get it nigga off the chain
I got that thug life shit runnin' through my veins
And now they scare, they know that I been heaven sent
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president
But look at us, we ain't got shit to lose
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home
This is the land of the free, but to me that's wrong
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat
So don't fall asleep
Come on niggas

Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

They say that the mo' they hate ya the mo' that it motivate ya
My mind set on grind, my mental set on the paper
62 hours and countin', and I'm still awake
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills, wit' the will I break
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up
Red dotted the media 'cause they always mad at us
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate, when we get gats and bust
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff
I'm takin' back my money counter 'cause it wasn't fast enough, yep
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the Ruger
To live like Freddy Krueger these nightmares just ain't as bloody
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep)
I can't relax 'cause it's like I'm a fetti activist
Might see me on TV never a mat-tress

Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep (Don't go to sleep nigga)
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep (Sleep baby)
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep

Tryna pay my debt for all my sins
See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm livin' just to die
I'm livin' in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waitin' for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
I blast and wonder ""How long will I last?""
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Bustas are shady so I'm dumpin' on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me, 
you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of makin' these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood – soon as I get home

Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home

Sittin' here lookin' at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and nude pictures, beggin' for some sexin'
Stay wide open, keep your eyes peeled
And my advice is ""Keep it real or you can die squeelin'.""
Plus, I never had to worry 'bout a visit, ‘cause you're there daily
Guards tryna get your number, you don't dare tell me
Tongue-kissin', steady humpin', tryna touch up somethin'
Before the C-O in the corner jump in, frontin'
Late night reminiscin', everybody's quiet
I think something's in the air, prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love and then let they heads ring
I started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the mornin', it's on soon as I get home

Grab my gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Let's get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home

Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Thinkin' big, like the kid from 
Casino
Fulfillin' my dreams like Nino
Brown
, the whole town be shook up
And me and Mama survivin'
Depends on how many rocks a young nigga cook up
Narcotics got traffic, 
seen those niggas you blasted
Wantin' me in a casket
, on a ground, kind of plastic
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love with these herbs
We out here frontin', still here but all about nothin'
But double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results livin' bad
Tricks of the trade, shit that shoulda been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Lessons between me and you
And once we lock this shit down it ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I stay waitin' by the phone
Hopin' I'll get a call tellin' a nigga that you home

Grab the gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowin' I'm comin' back
Go get my money out the safe

After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Time to make y'all, my military be prepared for the busters similar to
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em
Visions of over packed prisons, millions of niggas thug living
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crates (shh)
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensing niggas is defenseless I'm hitting fences then getting ghost
Who can prevent me shooting senseless at these nigga's throats?
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Take 'em to places face to face then erase 'em, and break 'em
Murder motherfuckers that are waitin' to quicken the pace

Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlaws busting while we rushing
We untouchable
Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
(Repeat 2x)

Aiyyo we won't stop, I let the '44 pop
Tanqueray and Alize' make niggas get shot
I'm smokin on some kush baby, you know it's all Gravy
Calicos, AK's, nigga's yellin' mayday
Payday, soon as the red dots connect
Off that haze and that 'dro, that Cali sticky icky
Strictly 2-1-3, 8-1-8, 3-2-3
3-1-0, we Outlawz, baby

I'm surrounded by thugs, slugs with crystals and pistols, callin'
Copy murderers that be softer than tissues
Got my persona soldier dedicated to the fuckin drama
My foes retreat like pros when they post my pros
Mashin' like piranahs or a pack of pitts
Bodies get wasted, paper chasin', tryna stack a brick
Dear mama, I'm touched for lots of lethal clutch, clingin' for a life which ain't much
And a lust for these guns to bust
Ain't no trust for these herbs tryna wet ya, keep my burner on the dresser
Wake up bustin' in the mornin' from the pressure


I never had a chance to be a buster, I was raised hard
With the only shed of tattooed tears out near the graveyard
I rep my Outlaws deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let the industry cheat me
Only behind the scenes do they see me as 2Pac the don
And this bitch with 2 Glocks, I'm wrong
The homie still gon' roll and standin' with your biggest G
You still gon' fold, I can guarantee you a lost
The homie 'Pac told me ""I can guarantee you a boss""
And it was in for a brief minute, far as my life
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
But still strugglin like Mumia Abu, it was 'bout to end truly I knew
Named my daughter Assadah, for that alone, make 'em more than a rider
Got every homie trigger finger under the set
Dope but guaranteed now my 1 on 1 will connect


Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through
Outlawz! We untouchable!",https://genius.com/2pac-untouchable-lyrics
Whatz Next,Pac’s Life,2006,"Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next?
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do
Now what's next?

Caught up in the middle
My life's a riddle
Don't let it get ya
I wanna be legal
But it's this hustle that get me richer
One love to my peoples makin' money
I can see you bubblin'
Avoid all trouble
Beware of devils, continue strugglin'
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way
So get your mind on official business
You can be great
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave
So get paid
My niggas do this every fuckin' day
We parlay through politics and conversation
This information to my thug niggas in the congregation
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation
Separation is self destruction
What's needed is unification
'Cause the world ain't hardly scared
If not prepared
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there
But no one cares it's there to share
All we get is stares
Because of fear, we'll evaporate
Say your prayers
And what's next?

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?
What's next?
Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game

Makaveli tried to warn us
But niggas ain't listen to Pac
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac
Shit yean got it yet (no)
Then you won't get it
Might as well measure 'em up
And have his ass fitted
Why
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane
Never will change niggas wit' no name no shame
Might open ya head foe mess broke change
I stay posted like a flag (flag)
Starin' thru my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag)
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now
Time foe a change
Real niggas rollin' wit' me
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets
Side track by the broads and the frauds
Ain't it strange
It's the reason so many niggas get scarred in the game
What's next?

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game
What's next?
I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

I'm goin' crazy
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do?

That money gotta make it
What I gotta do to make it?
Do I really gotta take it?
Put this mack up to you, face it
Doin' what we gotta do to survive
Just ask Kweli, doin' what we do to get by
Some niggas stick to the crime
Pitchin' nickel and dimes
What the fuck we s'pose to do, who gon' give us a job?
So I tried and tried
Tried to get out the grind
But the block kept on callin' me back
Fiends kept on callin' for crack
So I supply 'em wit' that
Gave 'em a reasonable fee
Nigga don't blame it on me
Shit just look where I'm at
Niggas in gardens, LAPD is the target
Niggas is heartless, hustle regardless
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin
What's next?

Hard livin' got me goin' insane
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game

Don’t Sleep (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2006,"Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep

Don’t sleep 'cause the boogeyman’s coming, grievin'
Lurkin' in the shadows, can you hear me, breathin'?
 sittin on your set like I’m a demon, schemin'
Lookin' for a victim, I can see these two, two, three easy (haha)
Cold-blooded my heart is freezing, declare war on me
And I’ma bring my mob and leave 
Swarmin' like locusts, targets and focus
Hocus pocus, murder's the case
Dumpin' on 'em like Calvin Broadus
Murdered in the worst degree
Smokin purposely, fucked off this old circuitry
Check the hearse and see how
You will unleash me, B.I.G
Muthafuckas pissed to make the list
Other endangered species
Sleep these niggas like sound the next rock-a-bye
Close your eyes, go to sleep
Now muthafucka die
Drinkin' squeeze, two, two, threes
Rid all of them like the snakes (these fakes)
Murder scene for deceased
Another miss and make

It don’t quit it, don’t stop
You pay a bitch, I’ll pay a crooked cop
Then hustle on the block, and stack my money that I future plot
Young Napoleon, Napole-on, it’s on, it’s on again
When liquor sip touched my liver, tell me will it ever end
I’m tired of mournin'
Wake up to another dead in the mornin'
Pray ‘fore I went to bed, still woke up dreamin' lead
These bitches and them vultures that surround my group
They wanna talk and drink a brew and claim they Thug Life too

Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of
Nigga lay ya down when I creep, on a mission to send ya six feet
Nigga don’t sleep

I blast first to they body, like my guns in varieties
Runnin' wit' the real big willies, that you silly punks try to be
But front, doin' my walk-bys rollin' blunts
Hands on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine, movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples, nigga nuttin' simple 'bout mine
Etch a sketch it, dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out, ain't no easy way out on easy exits
Don’t sleep

Walkin' dead in the back, passed out
My head talkin' to my damn self-stretched vexed
In my bed, and if I rest
How much I wanna bet how fast I fall over?
The edge on my face flat, but fuck that I’m a soldier
Wide-open, tired of livin' lies got me locin'
On mama’s eyes, the drama side won’t stop 'til I smoke ’em, potent
So I’m chokin', floatin', on my feet
Since these bitch niggas creep, why the fuck should I sleep?

Dumpin' on mothafuckas at random, rapidly
Wit' accuracy, they shouldn't'a talked bad to me
It had to be, a mothafuckin' murder I’m glad to be
The nigga that did the murder so sad to see
Another mothafucka dead, layin' in red
Wit' a big ass hole in his head, received by a thug (Nigga), no love
As I bloodied up his mothafuckin' mug picture
Snatched him up off the asphalt, then drove off to the hills positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Twisted his cap off, wrapped him up in plastic
Slid to the edge, and dumped his ass off
Then notified his whole family, of this tragedy
Murdered 'em without askin' me, who did it
Catastrophe is how I left it and you won’t see the last of me nigga
And I betcha, he got wet up, don't sleep
'Cause you fuckin' wit' realest nigga
You jeopardizin' lives when you fuckin' wit' soldiers (I told ya)
Fucked him up with extendo know (Ahh shit, haha)
Not with the sticks mothafucka, it’s game over

When I enter the first zone, worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up, evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy, manifestin' military styles
Casual tragedy when niggas battle me
My prophecized prediction, switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch, and watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin', still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'; Hell or prison
My ammunition varies, my voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world me and the mob gettin' married
It seems horrifying screams pierce the dark
Just as suspected, a trick bitch where is your heart
You mark, watch niggas fall when I call they name
We Outlawz hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til it's no one left
Don't sleep

Murder and pain come wit' the game if you choose to roll
Kickin' doughs, puttin' holes in mothafuckas leavin' hoes disposed of

Resist the Temptation,Best of 2Pac Part 1: Thug,2007,"Resist the temptation
This song go out to the Underground Railroad..
Digital Underground..

Resist the temptation of the beast
You slip and loose your grip, and forever fall asleep
The venom is contagious, be wary of its spell
What you thought would be heaven, turns out to be hell
I wonder if she knows, the devil's taking off her clothes
Deep into her soul, slow, now he's in control
Poppa's doing worse, a victim of his deadly curse
Wouldn't be the first, to leave the ghetto in a hearse
Oh and how it hurts, the children pay the biggest price
Never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
Blame it on the rock, but we know that's a bunch of crap
Someone from the top, supplying us with plenty crack
Keep 'em in a daze, don't let them see the other way
Let 'em all get paid, won't live to see another day
See, they never got a breath of the sunshine
Now the kid's addicted and only hit it one time
We're destined to be dead as a nation
Don't let it come to this, resist the temptation

From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Gamble for your soul with the devil
You wonder how low, can you go, before you finally reach the lowest level
As everybody sit and stares
There's no use looking in your eyes cause there isn't anybody there
And though it may make you wanna cry
Got you stealing from your family and you don't even know why
I guess you think they'll understand
You feel cold, cause you sold your soul to the dopeman
Oh now there's no turning back, in fact
It's decided, that would live and die for the crack
You got no friends cause you cheated 'em all
Feel lonely, low, defeated and small
No one was there when I took the wrong path
And nobody'd care if I died in a blood bath
But is this my destiny?
Tell the lord they got my mind, but he can have the rest of me
Cause I'm ready to end it all
One bullet to the brain, forgive my sins and all
I didn't mean to be a bother
A failure as a son, a husband and a father
I wish I could turn back the time
Go back and find, why I let it crack my mind
And my only explanation, it came to this
Resist the temptation

From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Your death left family behind
Your wife and your son find a gun, and pieces of daddy's mind
On the door and on the floor
Now her husband is dead, what else is she living for?
So now she picks up the gun
Now son is the only one
Grows up in adoption homes
Gets older, bolder, and cold cause he's left alone
To him, nothing is funny
Mind set on one thing, making his money
Since I was left with no hope
I want money and gold ropes and so I slang dope
Now I'm the neighborhood dopeman
And as long cause they smoking I'll never be broke man
I live the life of a trifle
Following a cycle, so I'm just a psycho
But if I had a better life
I would have lived a good life and did more things right
Hard to resist temptation
With all the aggravation and the frustration
Of living in the ghetto
Your mind gets twisted, just like a pretzel
So it's time that I check out
But one nosy cop, just won't let me get out
They got me trapped once again
With a choice: shoot the cop, or live life in the pen
I can't stand the frustration
Resist the temptation

From pyramid top to bottom of bowl
From whips and locks to fist and afro
We dug too deep to give up this gold
Don't be bought, and you won't be sold
Running on empty, you ain't gon' go
Running on empty, lead you to nowhere
We fact, nobody can lie
So resist the temptation

Thugz Mansion (Acoustic/Original),Best of 2Pac Part 2: Life,2007,"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to roll?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion
Every ghetto needs a thug mansion

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy (Thugz mansion)
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, ‘cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright
Nothing but peace, love
And street passion

Dopefiend’s Diner (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2007,"Late night coolin' with my homies
Drinkin' Hennessey and cold brew
After smokin', stopped in Oakland
Got the munchies for some soul food
So we stopped to get a bite to eat
At the local barbecue
It's just another boring Monday
And there's nothing else to do
Now as we stepped out of the car
I heard someone behind me fighting
So I turn to look and find out
What's the cause of this excitement
One brother was a dopefiend
And the other was a dope-man
And the dope-man had an AK
Said he'll spray and he's not jokin'
Well it seems to be the dopefiend
Owed the dope man for his product
And he swore if he did not pay
He would end up getting shot up
Now I could not walk away
'Cause I got caught up in the scene
Wondering what would happen to this
Poor and helpless fiend
Well my homie, Michael Cooley
Said let's go and make our order
What's the use in watchin' two men
Stand out here fight over quarters
While I walked inside the diner
And all the dope-fiends waved to me
Heard the sound of several gunshots
And I ran outside to see
All the people in the diner
Ran outside to see the big show
It was just another party
For them to see just who they would know
But for me I held concern
I wanted to go see the outcome
Would the mother have her son tonight
Or would she live her life without one?
I made it to the streets I
Almost cried right on the spot
Not only had the fiend died
But a small girl had been shot
And my heart could take no more
I felt a tear roll down my face
That was daddy's bullet
But she took it in his place
I tried to make my way through the crowd
So I could go help the baby
She could barely speak
But she whispered
Mister can you please save me
So I screamed out, someone help me
But I dont think they could hear
And if they did, they didn't care
Oh how I hated everyone there
The baby lie here dying
And I wondered what could I do
The cameramen and newspapers had come
To get their interviews
To them it's just a story
And they can't see the tragedy
To them it doesn't matter
'Cause it ain't, it wasn't their family
I don't think I'll be back
'Cause it'll never be the same here
So I wipe away the tears
And leave the scene the way I came here
Though some people say it's crazy
And the food could have been finer
I'll never forget, never forget the night

Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'

Indicting niggas like the grand jury
Make 'em regret the day they met me, the playa hatin' niggas resent me
'Cause all they tricks is in a rush to sex me
But I've been heavy in this game since seventy one
The world ain't ready for my mom duke celebrity son
But now they ass out, my shits so lethal making jealous niggas pass out
To all my people who love the music on my last album

Murderous game, I contain, I can off cold and fill him

Fatal and Felony will shine
Like diamonds and nickel nines
Corrupted cripplin' spines
When I creep up from behind
You silly barrel or get trampled nigga what
While these young thugs be leavin' shambles, in muthafuckas guts

Niggas know the cut he must of been peelin', crazy or just dest
To get on or hit up, In his muthafuckin' chest
When I come around creepin', through your itty bitty checks
In his eyes, and peep out the suspect
Outlaw Immortal

Check it, uh listen, come on
Outlaw Immortal, when this tussle, is on my  muscle
Off in this hustle, bustle, niggas be actin' tryin' to dust you
But fuck you, I ain't feelin' to be, laid, sprayed, and dead for days
Body partly decayed, a fuckin' dumpster as my grave
Can't find my body, so my casket had to be left empty
Don't even tempt me, had these niggas halved off in a fuckin' hefty
Still I done change, since I first to came
A lil' ridah,  you never knew, you never knew about this fuckin' game
But now my folks say I'm corrupted
So fuck it, I rather get lost, in this fuck shit, and  for my fuckin' dodgin'
Youngin' and thuggin' and that don't change even as I get older
I just get a little bit colder, stay a soldier while these niggas fold 'em
Throw up on stage never, still ready for whatever
Enjoyin' these sins of pleasure, Outlaw for fuckin' ever
Nigga

Outlaw
It's confirmed from the  concrete
No scapegoat, thug savage when my sweepers sweep
So rugged relentless, street royal relic
Crackin' hammers on domes, on bustas and rejects
Victors and violence, violations so vigorous
I know you real thugs feel this
An Ingle-Watts ledger, they ain't a legacy lost
You screamin' nation in my hood, got a Glock in my draws
This differ me from incarceration, in-fested with impurities
And at it with times, with police and activities
Cowards constantly cross a killers course
Corrupt to the core, confounded, no remorse
My territories in turmoil, my source full of terrorism
The terrain is insane, so for all my criticism
Engaged in the illest episode of evolution
Locked in a criminal institution
I'm a Outlaw Immortal",https://genius.com/2pac-immortal-lyrics

Yo' we 'bout to... check it out

What does it take to shake and bake nowadays?
Niggas in crime, get made 'cause it pays
Bodies get sprayed with motherfuckin' ultra-rays
When shit gets too smooth I get's, rude with the lipper
Any kind of liquor's company like Jack Tripper
There's been times when I flip like acrobats
Fuckin' coast to coast, chickenheads to hoodrats
Tools to Gats, Lowriders to Ac's
Two years ago my shit was underrated (Was underrated)
I wish you rap niggas frustrated
The rhyme stated updated; as I migrated
I'm direct from Strong Island, New York
Where I be smilin', profilin', wildin'
With my niggas in the Acura Coupe
In the Ja's and bitches like the Ginseng group (Ginseng baby)
Playin' that ""One Love"" loop Ha ha ha (Loop)
The sun shines through my sunroof (Sunroof)
Some days I can amaze the youth with proof that
The force of my rhyme can cause a cardiac (Cardiac)
Arrestin' motherfuckers that don't like investin'
So I eat them up like salad dressin' (Salad dressin')
And it don't stop

Hahaha, yeah nigga, that's how we do that shit
LS in this bitch, nigga that's how we do that shit
Die ,die on the Westside-Eastside right, niggas can't understand it, no doubt, no doubt

You bitch made niggas can't believe that shit
LS and niggas so crazy
You only have to pay, to pull up on that bitch
You've been clowned, to make it to that ground
These niggas snatchin' your business kid

They fucked around and let the 3rd bred about the stable (What's up?)
Me and my Cali niggas is jumpin' fools without the cables (Without the AK)
Everything I got is double 2's 4's and barrels
Once that ass slipped we gots to burn it like Carrol
Somehow someway real niggas know real niggas yeah yo why is that?
When you roll Asu, you end up with them tires flat
The names Asu, it starts with A and ends with you
Whatever you want to do, I got my whole fuckin' crew
Up over the mountain, there's fountain of phrases
I'm countin' pages, ages is givin' up wages to heal the rages
I don't riff, I stay cool let the sanity build
All I need is a starter and the horror that's worse than Amityville
No disrespect, all we want is bacon G
Pack them bags; they have them hotel got vacancy

That's right nigga set that shit 'til they motherfuckin' chincheckin' we wreck it, Look here

My niggas crooked, though it seems
My every single, thought is caught up, in collectin' cream
A made nigga, Picture me dyin' in the blaze, or gunfire
Will not retire 'til I'm paid, turn the bass up high
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 1-2-5 and do or die
Rollin' with niggas from Long Beach, to Long Isl'
I hardly smile, 'cause my heart froze
Once I, commence my show, I rip apart foes
Now I, got one nation, it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit let's get back to money makin'
Tell 'em bustas that I rolled on, controllin' our house
My shit's so wicked when I flip, niggas  closin' they mouth

Carpel tunnel, Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling

It's alright
It's It's
It's alright

They'll never take me alive
, I'm getting high with my four-five
Cocked on these suckers, time to die
Even as a youngster causing ruckus on the back of the bus
I was a fool all through high school kicking up dust
But now I'm labelled as a trouble maker who can you blame?
Smoking weed helped me take away the pain
So I'm hopeless rolling down the freeway swerving, don't worry
I'm about to crash up on the curb cause my visions blurry
Maybe if they tried to understand me, what should I do?
I had to feed my fucking family, what else could I do
But be a thug, out slanging with the homies
Fuck hanging with them phonies in the club
Got my mind on danger, never been a stranger to homicide
My city's full of gang bangers and drive bys
Why do we die at an early age
He was so young but still a victim of the 12 gauge
My memories of a corpse, mind full of sick thoughts
And I ain't going back to court
So fuck what you thought, I'm drinking Hennessey
Running from my enemies will I live to be 23
There's so much pain

It's alright, it feels like years since it's been here
It's alright, it's been a long cold lonely winter
It's alright, it feels like years since it's been here
It's alright, it's been a long cold lonely winter
It's alright

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell
It don't make sense, going to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies
God'll prolly have me on some real strict shit
No sleeping all day, no getting my dick licked
Hanging with the goodie-goodies lounging in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lying to my mother, even stealing out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fucking abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Sucking on her chest just to stop my fucking hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies


They got me mobbin like I'm
Loc'ed and ready to get my slug on
I load my clip and slip my motherfuckin' gloves on
I ain't scared to blast on these suckas if they test me
Trust, I got my Glock cocked playa if they press me
Bust on motherfuckers with a - paaassion
Better duck cause I ain't lookin when I'm - b-b-blaaastin
I'm a nut an' drinkin Hennessey and gettin' high
On the lookout for my enemies, don't wanna die
Tell me why cause this stress is gettin' major
A buck-fifty across the face with my razor
What can I do but be a thug until I'm dead and gone
Keep my brain on the game and stay head strong
These sorry bastards
Want to kill me in my sleep, I'm real they cannot see
And everyday is just a struggle
Steady thuggin' on the streets
And I'll be ballin' loc
Don't let 'em make you worry
Keep swingin' at these suckas till you buried
I was born to raise hell, a nigga from the gutta
Word to mother I'm trapped
I'm kickin dust up
Ready to bust
I'm on the scene steady muggin' mean
Until they kill me
I'll be livin this life

I'm gettin' high off buddha cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat
You can holler if you want to, please!!
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew  bleed!!
Enemies and my range is on, you're in the danger zone

It's like they stuck from makin' niggas duck from Glocks
And all the time, my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
Will 'em away in the mornin', only the strong survive
I cry, but in my own way swallow my pride
Pick a reason to hide from all the niggas that die
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild
I came up out this dust with my heartless style

Don't need no punk fools payin' me
And broke groupies and hootchies don't faze me
I take two steps back and release myself
To put platinum and gold on the record shelf
I don't brag, but I do it like a straight up is
Before you do a record, partna, handle your business And don't get caught slippin' on the under

God Emcees,UnKnown,2017,"Interlude :
You gotta understand that when it was in to have a gun and be in the street, my mother gave that up to be in the house and wash the dishes and feed us and put the thoughts in our brains. Because we didn’t get any of that history from any of those soldiers that we lost--we got none of that. They all went to jail, if you can remember. They all went to penitentiaries
Verse 01 2Pac :
Callin' all dogs and phony rap stars
Who think they got me
I'm on some Superman shit now
They shouldn't have shot me
Uh
Cause I'm convinced that my squad is real
And God has blessed me with the power to be hard 2 kill
I got a mind that's full of murderous thoughts
When unleashed
I make them niggas bow
Feel me now or be deceased
I ain't choosing sides
Hell no
Fuck everybody
It's Westside when I ride watch 4 dead bodies
Lyrics are colorful words and anesthetics
Problems are getting worked out faster than calisthenics
I'm bullet proof
Blazed up on top of my man's roof
Hands on a fully AK so what'chu plan to do
Moon motherfuckaz 'til they feel me
It's West Coast nigga fuck New York
Now did everybody hear me?
You shot at my homies now Imma blast
Screamin' Thug Life muthafucka when I pass

Verse 02 Rakim :
Dance floor's dangerous
Packed in like a briefcase
Rhyth with ral rough rhyme
Beats with deep bass
Girls with tight pants
Maybe they might dance
Tonight if the Rs on the mike
There's a slight chance
The crowd is crucial
M.C.'s grounds are neutral
Now that you're here let me introduce you
Get ready
I'm hard read like graffiti but steady
Science I drop is real heavy
Radiant energy, that'll be the penalty
Touch the third rail on the pain of remedy
The prescription's one every hour
Now it's a HABIT
Ya need another hit from the freestyle fanatic
Attention: follow directions real close
Keep out of reach of children
Beware of overdose
Too many milligram
NO ONE made a iller jam
My rhyme is the rhythm of thoughts
That kill a man
Ideas for the ear to fear
Might split 'im
He'll never forget 'im
He'll rest in peace wit' 'em
At least when he left he'll know what hit 'im
The last breath of the words of death
Was the rhythm

I'm gettin' suspicious of this bitch
The line's busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway -- see ya later!
To all the players, watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other
Now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure, gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies, they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the 5-0's roll, the motherfuckers pass
By me like they know me, smilin' as they laugh
I put up my middle finger, then I dash
Niggas don't like me, ‘cause I'm thuggin'
And every day I'm a hustler lookin' to get paid
Chorus :
Niggas don't like me, ‘cause I'm thuggin'

Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous, because I'm high
Don't mention funerals, I'm stressin' and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' 'bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder: When will I be happy? Ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin' caps, anything for money
Where am I goin'? I discovered, can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday, bitch, you know you shouldn't have did it

And its a bitch cause the judge gave you 8 years
You doin 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over turned snitch like a bitch

Like Betty Crocker baking that first pie
The beef we serving is stir fried, swerving all through your urban
Hurting, every gate and corner, you working, I'm

And my set is throwing up dollar signs

We can have peace someday, G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got a nigga smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed

See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back

Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya

I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'mma throw a change up
Quayle ain't do nothing but blow my name up!
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They feel me when they rollin in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble -

Holler if ya hear me!
Holler if ya hear me!
You're too near me, to see it clearly
Holler if ya hear me

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I kick
Representin, never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -

Baby Don’t Cry/Keep Ya Head Up II (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"I feel ya.. baby don’t…
But you can’t, you can’t give up

Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Uh

Now here’s a story ’bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin’ quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me
“What would you do if it was you?”
Couldn’t answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn’t picture three crazed niggas grabbin’ me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain
Lord come and take me
Four niggas violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn’t me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin’ with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
'Cause they win when your soul dies

Baby please don’t cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don’t cry",https://genius.com/2pac-baby-dont-cry-keep-ya-head-up-ii-original-version-lyrics

Watch me
Wipe 'em scared
Oh
Why is it that we gotta be
(Watch your back)
Contacting niggas in the cemetery
Funeral homes
Buried
Seein' all my homies buried
Moms all worried and shit
Why is so many black brothaz dyin
One day we can all be together smokin' weed gettin' high
Maybe in our dreams over sheds is reality
Wheres your family at?
Niggas say one love
Fuck one Love nigga
One Nation

Now it's time for
Retaliation, perpetrating get you punished, how could you
Cross the nigga that put food inside your stomach?
Watch me
Point the pussy out the crowd time to pay for
Past discretions, never learned your lessons in this deadly war
Let's explore the possibilities, them niggas killing me
Head all busted
Over this trick nigga I trusted,
 now it's
Hard to figure knew this nigga for eternity
And, never in my deepest thoughts figured he could turn on me

So many to choose from
Niggas close to me I wonder how I lose them (How I lose one)
Maybe because I put them on the podium before me (Oh yes)
I use to think that's how it should be
Until them niggas cross me, it's different now (Different now)
Bitches wait until I got cold (Turn it up)
And told a boldfaced lie (Lie)
But still I never asked why (Turn it up) (Why?)
I keep stepping with my weapon on queue
Cause now I got my eye on you (Got my eyes on you)
Before my crew, remember how you do
Now you want to pursue
The B.D Buck just because your jealous as a motherfucker (Jealous as a
Motherfucker)

Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
In the end it's
And in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
Overcome all the troubles
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
Your fight (Your fight) (Your fight is my fight)
Your fight (Your Life)
What you gonna do?

Now if my memory serves me justly
I showed you love but you the same one that tried to fuck me
And now I got this pistol pointed at your mouth, ready to squeeze
You see, snitching is an epidemic killing disease
Exit
Throw your gun away, take your time, free your mind
Forget about the crime, and it will all go away in time
My information strictly based on niggas faces
Past cases with the law, plus a life of living raw
Brothaz at arms

Every man has a right to decide his, own destiny
In the end it's
And in this judgment there is, no partiality
So arm in arms (Arm in arms)
We fight to live and struggle (Fight to live and struggle)
And that's the only way to
Overcome all the troubles
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Let's get it on now
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Let's get it on now
Your fight is my fight (Your fight)
Let's get it on now
(What? Say what?)
Let's get it on now
Uh

My fight is your fight, we could do this all day and all night
So I tell you what, One Nation, we gon' set up this plantation
This foundation, and we gon' take it to the real enemy

The one, the war continues, the struggle continues

Dayz Of A Criminal (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"We're live in Marin City, joining the manhunt for the four suspects in the Marin City massacre, where six police officers and three informants have been brutally murdered by the Jungle Posse. Police seem to be baffled to the whereabouts of these four suspects. D-Money easily spotted in candy burgundy Mercedes-Benz. Playa-Playa last seen in the 79 tall buildings. Whizz last spotted in high-speed pursuit with the CHP. 2Pacalypse, alleged rhyme boss set to have plotted and engineered the entire attack. These four men are armed, dangerous and should be considered a threat to all law enforcement agencies. Shoot to kill

Born in the days of a criminal
Runnin' from the cops and can't let 'em see me
So I'm hopin' out the Benz
It's time to let the valet step, gotta make my ends
So business on the undertip, all coppers will be dropped
So tell them not to fuck with me, 
if Oaktown gets too hot
I'm headin' for Marin City
Though hunted like a fugitive, them punks will never capture me
TEC-9 on my side, ooh, sting in back of me
And black from head to toe, I move and there's a silence
The smoothest criminal, a lunatic for violence
So I be takin' no shorts when the shit get scandalous
Perkin' off the zesty, so nigga, we can handle this
Run up and get smacked up, backed up and smacked down
I'm a playa, there's more in the J-town
Bitches wanna jock, and run they hands all in my hair
Ho give up the cock, or you can get up outta here
I'm livin' like a mack, the narcist will be minimal
Niggas gettin' jacked with they caps peeled back

I'm kickin' kilos, but I started with a quarter ounce
Servin' with eight, 'cause every little dollar counts
Makin' my grits, and tryin' to get my mail on
So fuck a cop, he'll get dropped if he steps wrong
I'm the bad guy, everybody points at me
But fuck 'em all, as long as the tweakers happy
Makin' my cash flow, how long will it last though?
Pimpin' ain't easy, but I'm still leavin' your ass broke
Pass the vapors as the papers will be comin' in
I'll get the guts, and give a fuck about being a friend
Bitch, I'm a playa, I got no time to be bothered with
Havin' no babies in no long-term relationships
Because a bitch'll be a bitch no matter what you'll say
That's why I fuck 'em, bust a nut, then I'm on my way
Soon as I finish I'll regret I even fucked a whore
'Cause she'll be blowin' up my beeper before I shut the door
But fuck a bitch, I keep my mind on my green 'cause yo

It's the menace of Marin,
 I've killed, I'll kill again
Ain't nothing funny 'bout the game I'm rollin' in
You got a problem with it, mister, handle yours
I ain't no joke, I'll have you broke down to your draws
I'm trigger happy, and I give less than a fuck
Love me or hate me, I'ma sho' 'nough rip shit up
It's Mr. Nothin', nice on the mic stand
Mic in the left and the zest in my right hand
I took a puff, had enough now, hold up
If that was indo, niggas gettin' rolled up
You think not gettin' dropped, we can handle this
'Cause 2Pac brain locked on a cannabis
Days are dangerous, shoot 'em, but you can't miss
I never tripped off your bitch 'cause she scandalous
Now come and get a good look at the crook
Who lives his life on the streets of the Jungle
Some call me animal, tell me how you figure though?
Put 'em in a nip, in the days of a criminal

Straight jackin', nigga I'm lethal when I'm loc'd out
Like crack, take the breath out your body, leave you smoked out
Talk shit if you wanna, but you'll get fucked, the game is thick
Rollin' in Dayton's pimpin' and playin' a sucka, bitch
Ask who's the mack? In fact let's check out the men in black
'Cause Whizz'll be gettin' his strictly biz, I'll be makin' stacks
5.0, rollin' low in the J-town
Eyes on this as I dip with the top-down
Draped in silk, more gold than a Aztec
I'm pimpin', it ain't many hoes I ain't had yet
""But what's the whizz stand for?"" Bitch, ask me
Well, that's the sound as I pass the Lassie
You toe-up, toe-down, ran though, beat down
Hoes then stroll through the streets of the J-town
Whizz'll be gettin' his grit and gettin' his dick licked
And don't have to trick, bitch
Stand back and check yo' self 'cause you're livin' low

Blastin', dumpin'
Bitch

I got my pistol cocked and my knife
'Bout to slice this nigga windpipe
Throwin' tops, swervin' me on the dice
Nigga thought he was nice with the slickness
But the nigga I am, sham, just swift with the quickness (Mark ass bitch)
Respect the game, the lame niggas die slow
Hustlers fly straight like Frank feared Scarface
From the Glock, the lead waste
Diggin' out your chest plate up straight
Trimmin' you from your winge and hit the gate, I'm not waitin'
Thinking between and runnin' on my escape
Hop on the 2-10 and wait for you to retaliate
The terrorist doin' on niggas who we {​Glock cocked}​
Glock never miss, through your grill here goes my fist
When I slit yo' wrist
With the the styles of ruckus south central
Los scandalous anybody get buckets uh (West side)
I'm doin' niggas in the rap tussle
Rip out your backbone slow, you go to pieces like a puzzle
I'm hand on muzzles to you whack MC's
Black fitted cap to the back with the Gap jeans to my knees
Niggas under siege, like Seagal they fall
To my tactics chin checkin' in charge like chart, I want it all
The loot, the chronic, plus the dips
First nigga that flinches catch a bullet from my hip
In a rage, serving gauge with my Glock to your grill
Let the dump-dumps loose, now your brains is on the ceiling nigga

Murderous mindstate
Can't keep my nine straight
Sippin' on this hennessey
Waitin' for the time to break
Show up and mothafuckas bow down, recognize
West Side, Death Row, outlaw riders
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well known felons labeled for drug sellin' merciless jackers
Forever buzzed
Roll with thugs and dawgs
Commence to lettin' off rounds
Then escape in the fog
Who wanna see me solo?
Catch Makaveli while he's sleepin'
My mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin', Uhhh!
Duck or you ass out!
Drink 'til you pass out! (what)
Ain't scared to die
Drunk drivin' in my Glasshouse
Niggas is under me
They bitches come to me
They heard the stories nigga
Now they wanna really see
Bomb first, my motto, is fully guaranteed
Niggas is playahatas
Label them my enemies then dumpin'

Look out young nigga!
'Cause it's time to dump
I'm versatile ,mothafuckas
What type of rhyme you want?
Niggas got me in they sight
Now I'm runnin' for my life
Tell me!
What's that, West Side like?
West side!

I'm all about the paper chase 'cause the paper makes life so great
Plus, haste makes waste
And I gots the whole spot lock down, concoct styles
Catch me rollin' all the fuck around with the top down (Nigga, what?)
Realest with the microphone
Most murder masher verbal disaster
Creator, 38 stasher
In the inner zone where the hellraiser roam
There is not place like home, TEC-9s and chromes
Got the heater sequence for the heat to the disperse
Just in case worse come worst, I dumps first
So pump curt curse, it's the curse of the pump pump
The one to dump last is the first to get slumped
It's the mental temptation, mental assassination
My heart skips a beat for the heat sensation
I'm death-defying, bitches lyin' sayin' I ain't cute
Now she wants an autograph (Hey, give me an autograph) Bitch, I ain't Snoop (What?)

One bone bitch ready to go for broke
Hittin' up your marks with my motherfuckin' 4
I'm comin' up about the Hills so feel I'm ready for the static
And niggas on my team is the full flesh automatic
Planting all you hoes in your motherfuckin' place
A bitch named Scarlo is steppin' up in your face
I'm dustin' off you chumps with the .44 slugs
And livin' from the lichter bro I'm ready to pull your plug
So, nigga, you wanna jump? You gotta jump little higher
Scarlo, nigga, the miss messiah
So bitch you better get a grip on gangs
You fuckin' with the hillside, mentally insane
Point of no return and  now my life is on the edge
Believin' in my misery I fucked her in the yeah
Giuseppe called me up and told me so
I gotta do a mission on my ass I gotta go
'Cause you can run, hide (Hide)
But I'm gonna getcha when tryna escape
You know my gat won't letcha run, hide
But I'm gonna getcha when tryna escape
You know my gat won't letcha
West side for life
Biaaaaaatch!

I'm dumpin'
Empty my gun
It's time to run
'Cause here come the cops
I'll be duckin' 'em for blocks
Nigga I'm dumpin'
Empty my clip
Forever bustin'
East Coast nigga rushin'
Mothafucka, I'll be dumpin'

Killer!
Loaded them things, nigga, it's time to dump
Sneakin' on niggas that be sleepin' when they ass in the trunk
You slipped, then got crept on, now it's ride time
To the hills where niggas kill and peel your shit on skyline
It's die time, and can't any niggas save g
So kneel to your fuckin' knees and feel this 45 fade you
Aimin' for heads, pumpin' lead 'til I bury you
Niggas be duckin' but I swingin' low like chariot
No love, pumpin' slugs like I'm servin' dogs
Buck buck, now tell your dead homies I said, ""What's up?""
Lullaby, rock-a-bye, nigga die
And rest in piece, eternal pain from this fire
My 45 smoked and broke ya
And nothin' hurt like a dick with his liquid, in his eyes wide open
Gats smokin' no jokin', Bullets to me
Deleted soul from his core, as he lay, as I was dumpin'",https://genius.com/2pac-die-dumpin-original-version-lyrics

Okay, now let's take a look, what do we got now?
To the second looks, the crooks gon' prop now
All these mean muggin' brothers from the streets
Have turned into tender lovin' rubbin' club beats
I just don't understand it and frankly I don't get it
And even if it is, better fakin' I ain't wit' it
So if you lookin' for a fool, you can pass me
No funky footsteps here, so don't even ask me
That's why dancers on the payroll gettin' paid
But ain't no dancers in the studio when the record's made
It's just me and Big D goin' buckwild, on top of the pile
I'm giving emcees nuff styles
So come come make you done if you feel it wrong
Lay low and lean but sleep and I'ma pull ya cards
2Pacalypse is rockin' it for the public
Bumping it and they love it and I'm hit like Razor Ruddock
So what you wanna do now? You and your crew are through now
Think the ice is meltin', 'cause brothers are comin' true now
Hitting it with the furious styles, and I'm paid to say
Hip-hop's here to stay, they fade away

To Mister Sambo, stop and fetch your look alike
Hook in like a crook, I stepped up and took your mic
And when there's not a single instrument playin'
And ain't nobody prayin', I can't hear a word that you sayin'
Heard you sold a million records in a million states
But there's a million fake, a million snakes sellin' a million tapes
And the Tipper Gore don't impress me
She's a threat on a quest to undress me
Sometimes I jest, I don't vest, so don't test me
This ain't no bus, so don't rush or arrest me
Don't disrespect me, punk, I'm a citizen
Making money and rippin' angels is beautiful world we're living in
Looking at the Grammy nominations, smilin' in my face and
Waitin' to take my place at the pace of a corporation
This is just a taste of the aggravation, frustration
Having a faith in your occupation
Cops think I'm selling a basin, I'm selling tapes and
Tryna take my race to the better place and
Peace to the brothers that paved the way
Rollin' over in they grave today while they fade away

You know I ain't tryin' to act a fool
And be rude, they call me Kastro
And you; Oh! Storm sound like a cutie too
What's poppin'? with me and you
Just hit me with the seven
It'll be my pleasure to see what we can do
Oh! you ain't alone, got a man at home, answerin' the phone
But he ain't the one, 'cause if he is, than why you gone?
What you drinkin' on? - Hennessy with me
A glass of Thug Passion or just a plain Pepsi
Oh! you're cool? - sure that I assume
You ain't too much of a drinker today
You was alright, I think I want you right away
See, I'm only eighteen, these groupies they just want to sue me
Push my whoopty, act like they don't spend my dooky
And I could see it'd be
Twenty-two or so, older soldier on my team
I put you in my video, and give you plenty of dough
By my hotel room, Four fifty four, hope that you go
Baby, can you fade me?

You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me

See girl, I'm laced with game but it ain't similar
The shit that I'm talkin' get more deeper
Than callin' and comin' to visit ya, it's hard to feel ya
But I been playin' since I been born
And I moved up in a age strolled the page, turned it, now it's on
Can't ignore, the way you hit the club and play the floor
Hittin' up every position and that's for sure
But I think it's more, than situation that I'm facin'
Your Shorty was hesitation so I'ma replace her
Plus to get specific; it ain't no hoochie that's unlisted
That the homies that I roll with ain't twisted
And that what makes me diss it
I ran through cousins, through aunties on down to triplets
For droppin' the highest level of game and got no digits
Now can you dig it? - but you ain't in no competition
'Cause most conversations you be kickin' you sure to get it
Now, baby can you fade me?

You can't fade me, you can't fade me
You can't fade me, you can't fade me

This is how you get her up
You don't know how to rule no bitch nigga

Look how you stutter and shit nigga, watch out
Get to the side, which one?
Pick all out, pick out nigga, which one?
That one? - peep this shit

Hold up baby, would you get off, thinkin' you can fade me?
Evadin' my niggas like radius and then attempt to play me
Oh! yeah, you're crazy thinkin' you can just be Swazy
'Cause my conversation; gettin' you hot enough for love makin'
Participation is needed, yeah, I'm drunk and gettin' weeded
In the back of my Jaguar, the life of a rap star
Completely freak-able
I get weak, when I sit and think of shit that we can do
Let me introduce Mr. Makaveli is who you're speakin' to
What's up with you? - as you can see I love freakin' you (Boo)
Who, Black, Mexican, Puerto Rican too
Long as it's ghetto you can bet I'm gettin' deep in you
Believe it boo, I got my eyes concentrated on the size of your thighs
No I ain't Dre baby, but won't you let me ride?
'Cause a nigga want the putty cat
This Thug Passion so your man can't have it back
And that's a fact, so, how you want to act?
Baby, can you feel me? - like Run D.M.C. ""It's Like That""
Tell me, can you fade me?

She was fine some of us scream for magazine (just shit up)

Check this out man (what's up)

Trapped like a prisoner, fantasize of kissin' her
Treat you like a queen but other guys is dissin' ya
Thinkin' of ya nightly thigh so hold you tightly
Visualizin' figure, damn that excites me
I wonder if you know how much I think of you
If I can throw you water, then I sink in you
It's for eternity, this feelings are burnin' me
It's like a fire, this desire yearns to be pullin' me
Closer, until your chest is close to mine
Feelin' you heart beat, our arms are intertwined
Wantin' to kiss you, the passion raisin'
But don't wanna rush you, so I'm still waitin'
What if we were lovers, what a night that be
Cause we be raidin' undercover like the savage beast
Close my eyes and visualize, it's you I feel
Then wake up and realize, it was not real
It was just my heart, playin' tricks on me
Its tryna to make my fantasy a reality
Cause just thinkin' about ya baby, makes you want ya more
These feelings make me crazy but I can't ignore
What you mean to me, you're a dream to me
No matter how realistic it seems to be
Gotta get a grip on myself, because I'm dissin' myself
I wake up, I realize that I be kissin' myself
I just have to find this girl in my fantasy
And hope that someone in this world is who meant for me
But if I find her, will I have the nerve to speak?
Or will me ego overrob makin' my heart to greed?
I gotta do it, I gotta tell her how I feel
It's the only chance to make my fantasy turn real
Now my heart beats fast, I sweat feat on my thumb
Gotta get myself together cause here she come
I said: 
hi
, she was fly, get lost in her eyes
Tried to speak another word but my tongue was tied
Damn, I can't explain it, the state I'm in
Every time I try to speak, I stutter again
Feel like I'm ready to cry, embarrassed outof  my mind
She smiles and gives me her number and says call her sometime
But she walks away, almost as quick as she came
And it hit me, I never even knew her name
So when I turned around, I felt my heart broke
She was gone, so was the number she wrote

It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
I fell in love with a fantasy

Straight man (word man I feel you)
Oh cuh (well do it your way man)
But check this out man I just coming from the crib man, oh man
She's  I can't believe this man (what's up what)
Let me tell you  is sayin'
(break it down to be do, what's up)
Check this out

I woke up this Thursday mornin' in a terriful mood
Went straight to the kitchen cause I needed some food
Step inside, the kitchen door had tell me what I would see
A giant stackin' dirty dishes are waitin' for me
I didn't really wanna do it so I accepted the facts
Spill out all my funky tequila swisher and my feline hat
Sat in my yard, then I noticed it was nice outside
Tell my [partner, ""Hmm, I think I'll go for a ride""
Rollin' down the avenue chillin' my way
With the incredible sound (of who?) Marvin Gaye
I see my homie on the corner, ""What's up, Terry T?""
""Yo check this out,"" is what he said to me
Told me that he knew a lady that I needed to meet
Super fine like wine and she couldn't be beat
I said, ""Okay,"" he said: ""Come on in,"" then we went to her house
But when she opened the door, I couldn't open my mouth
I mean damn there she was, right in front of my face
And here I am cold fuzzin' like I'm in disgrace
She had a beautiful smile, eyes greener than grass
And god damn, homeboy you shoulda see that well
I don't wanna get explicit, but you know what I mean
The type of girl that don't recover of a magazine
She said her name is Limay, I didn't know what to say
Except my name is Ryan D. and it's beautiful day
We went outside and had a drink, conversated a bit
Terry said we had to leave, but then she told me to sit
She said: ""Terry, you can go, but Ryan's stayin' awhile""
When she said this to my homie I just started to smile
She says she wanted to talk, so she can know me some more
I said, ""Cool""
Terry left and then she locked door
Now I'm a cool type of fellow, really mellow with her
And when she came and step beside me I had sweat in my palms
I mean she was so fine, I can't explain to my brothers
Finer than the dilla Ice T's album cover
I said, ""Well, here we are. What we can do now?""
She looked me deep in my eyes and broke it all down
She said, ""Ryan D., as hard as this may seem, I wanna make love to you, you're the man of my dreams""
She said she saw me before, and then she knew that day
She had to get me, had to have me somehow, some way
I said, ""Baby, don't you worry, cause I think I'm in love. You're the angel of my life, sent from heaven above""
Without a moment's hesitation, we were deep in the groove
Bodies tight and touched together as we started to move
Only with persistent movements, I removed her clothes
She was heavy as the kiss she began to moan
First she start, twist me back I really don't know how
She put her arms around my neck and said, ""I want you now""
She was already hot, I had began to sweat
I knew that this would be a moment I would never forget
She told me lay on my back so she can get on the top
She said, ""Make it last, please, and just don't stop""
I had my eyes closed now that she felt so soft
But when I open my eyes, my alarm went off
I got up, rubbed my eyes
""What's goin' on?"" I said
It was then I realized that I was home in my bed
I said, ""Damn,"" to myself, as hard as it may seem
Imagination had to go but it was only a dream

It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
I fell in love with a fantasy
[Outro/Interlude: 2Pac & 
Ryan D.
]
Damn, man. That's hard, man
Man, it was bugged out
Ain't that weird, though? We both felt like that?
Man, it was sort of a trip, man
I can never tell a homeboy this, man. Yo, keep this between me and you, man. Nobody ever gonna believe nothin' like this. Alright man, I'm straight goin' to school man
Just remember that shit, man
Word
I don't know what to tell you, man
Yo, see you later on, dude
Alright. Know what it was, though?
Peace man. Yo, what?

It was a fantasy
Nothin' but a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy
We fell in love with a fantasy

It might be intimidating to a certain point
Don't worry it's cool
Gaffling your wits, wilding you tricks
'Cause I'ma make suckas do the splits
That's why they cross the floor like a chorus line
As I prepare to drop a gorgeous rhyme
With a pretty presentation, placed with a purpose
A shade of green and crazy Del's on the scene
To lean the strike of perpetrators
Fakes and frauds, while the audience applauds
They get enthusiastic when I use the drastic measures
To keep the thieves out the treasures
I can kick a freestyle and recollect the segment
Like a movie, and I still sound groovy

Nobody thought I'd make it, the world called me loser
Just a high school dropout, young drug abuser
Mama told me there'd be days like this, I never listened
Spent my childhood years in my neighborhood prison
The world don't give a fuck about the kids
I can see from the poverty and the evil shit they did
To my young nation
Participation, more hesitation could turn lethal
When ain't no love for a young nigga, he turn evil
And burn people with no hope, there's no peace
So all my niggas start regulatin' on your streets
Bustin' the neighborhood scatters, another drug war
There ain't no truce or negotiatin' with thug lords
Tried conversatin' but he won't listen
He said the world is a livin' hell for God's children
Picture him still in the pen', doin' life plus two

It's clearer now, 'cause I'm a noted individual
Plus I'm a Don, not just a small time criminal
Times have changed, homies died, only lives remain
Massive amounts of narcotics help me hide the pain
Wishin' on Benz, came up on a Jag
Then got it out for the quiet times, reflect on the past
All my homeboys that didn't make it, for you I'll do it
'member back in the days as young truants
HUH! tellin' me to beware
Because you cared and helped me to be prepared
Cemetery full of homies no longer here
But what about the babies, lost in watchin' burglars
Too dumb to be a dealer, too young to be a murderer
I'm beggin' you God, don't make their lives too hard
They're already scarred, too doped up to see the stars
We're livin' to die, everybody is high, plus I'm high too

Pictures are plenty, handlin' semi, sippin' Henny
I hustle for pennies, know my own feared by many
I watched and took notes as a child I strategized
Witnessin' crack dealings and drug killings have scattered lives
Niggas don't know me but they think
That we could be closer than homies
Nigga you're phoney so quit buyin' drinks
Mind on my money, you're funny, you're about my currency
Niggas don't wanna see me
Shootin', but they ain't worry me, livin' to tell
Prison is hell for a nigga, they're usin' my bail
Built bigger jails for a nigga
Father I'm feelin' tired, forgive me, 'cause I'm a sinner
Livin' life as a thug, while duckin' cops and the criminals
Homies is dead and buried, past times are gone
You ask why I drink liquor? 'Cause my mind is gone
And if I die, then let me watch what we been through

MAC-11 is heavy, yet I'm ready to pull quick
Niggas ain't ready for a brother that's livin' major
Bear witness to a sick motherfucker that's spittin' razors
When I cut 'em they cut, when I stick 'em they stuck
And my ambitions to bust, 'cause I ain't givin' a fuck
We tore the neighborhood up, look at all the shit that we did
Murder's a life long bids, if my enemies love they kids

You don't wanna die
And I don't wanna kill ya
Keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
All my enemies buried for the shit that they did
Don't make me murder you nigga
If my enemies love their kids

Bodies is wrapped in plastic, nigga, this is drastic
Just takes a nigga with the right automatic to cause static
Like a Mossberg dumpin', and muthafucker'll do jumpin'
Make 'em role of a bitch, like Michael Jackson, "" Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' ""
Holla at my crew and they perish, who do you cherish?
Got that ass in my sight
Tonight I'm bussin' off the terrace with multiple gun shots
Niggas is droppin' rapidly, bussin' at crooked cops
Them bitches is runnin' after me, tell 'em I'm high
When they ask ""why I'm trippin' out the top of my drop?""
'Cause you know why?
Keep dippin' on my block they sell rocks and box with frail cops
If not we buss shots from Glocks, fuck cops
My only fear of death, can you hear me, it's ""comin' back""
Had enough of this bullshit world so none of that
I felt no remorse for all the shit that we did
Niggas dyin', hear the sirens, if my enemies love their kids

You don't wanna die
And I don't wanna kill ya
Keep my name out ya mouth
'fore a nigga have to drill ya
All my enemies buried for the shit that they did
Don't make me murder you nigga

Ride on these bitch ass mothafuckers
Ride on 'em!

I don't even wanna talk no more
Losin' your life, what for?
Facin' a young muthafucker who puts it down for the dough
Get killed in front of your kids, God forbid if it happen
'Cause the shit I'm on now I'm taking pass on us rappin'
Gotta survive by myself, but at the same time get wealth
Won't put my gun on the shelf, it keeps me livin' like heaven
But when the shit jumps I'm ready 'cause I already knew
You better get us muthafucker 'fore we come get you
Deep in my heart I think this shit's about to pop any moment
Tryna do me like my parents but I'm a tougher opponent

This nigga scared, must be rusty and all I'm prepared
For all the drama, you stayed with all them niggas you feared
You fuckin' busta, musta let the evil or the money trap you and slap
Every second we comin' at you and you the last one
When no rocksis tryna cast one
Guess a young rider who would die for fuckin' blast of that thug passion
Clashin' on enemies passin'
Gigglin' when they should've been figurin' who would be the last one, laughin'

Quit acting mean to me, you're teasing me the way you flaunt
But you ain't hearing me, sincerely, I'm so attracted
Pictures of target practice making love on my mattress
Visions getting graphic
So realistic you could grab it, it's a proven fact
Baby gotta have it, my love making quite magic
Tricks is for kids bunny rabbit, let a man have it
Bet you'd be satisfied if you tried my habit
High performance is hard to handle
Naked in the bubble bath while I'm burning candles
Sex me like a slow song
If fucking you was bad baby then I'm so wrong
My feeling's so strong
I keep staring like you can't see me
I never planned to scam, my thoughts ran freely

We're out on the road, we're sporting Diamonds and Gold
We're pushing Yachts and Jet Skis, smoking on hell of weed
We're trying to have millions man, y'all can have them Gs
Bitches flocking up eying nothing, all about them papers
We're standing away from the player-haters and the impersonators
But we're sporting Gators and we don't cater to no hoe
From San Diego to Vallejo and all the way down to Idaho
You know, you wonder why this game don't change
They say you gotta have a way from the very start
So when I step into a club like Magic Cities
They be greedy with passion and the whole Atlantic city
And pull up to a seed that had never sparked
And post up, just like the Double R
Don't get mad; 'cause a nigga ain't spent shit
I'm just watching it and besides I'm a pimp, bitch!

Homie having fun with no gun (Haha What's up baby?)
Death Row got the party off the hook
I take the Chronic, I take a book (What up Kurupt?)

As soon as my eyes open, the first thing hits
Me and the homies on the strip, fuck around with some Swiss
As soon as I hit the corner I'm on ya, eyes on scope
I'm about to soothe on my way to see Daz, 'Pac and Snoop
There's something cute about five foot six
And no sweat, I'm on set for the triple-double twist
That's why I trip, I got to clear my mind
Take a couple hits of this bomb
Nate Dogg hit the switch to say fuck you bitch
'Cause if I spent I'm taking two pussy, I just wanna fuck
Even though deep down I know she got some bomb ass pussy
So what would you do? roll, pass and just stop

Komradz (So So Crazy),Unreleased Songs,2002,"Well, I just heard some shit on this record
(Fuckin' in the midst of my comrades)
I send this out to that biatch; you too, nigga!
(Standin' in the midst of my comrades)
You fuckin' with some thug niggas (That's right)
Believe that like you believe crack kills, you stupid mothafucka!
(Fuck you! Standin' in the midst of my comrades)

You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades (comrades)

Have you really thought about your part in this participation?
My prediction bloody murder similar to menstruation
Now in fairness to conversation
‘Cause it's your fate so take the time
To contemplate what you'll be facin'
Talkin' that Hip-Hop shit, don't get shot, bitch
‘Cause you can tell all in your clique to eat Pac's dick
The clip's in, prepare for the mothafuckin' death blow
‘Cause every rapper in the industry is history, it's Death Row
Not Bad Boy or *So So Def*
I make you bow before Tha Row like them other hoes
The intricate design of my lethal lines, criminal rhymes
From the mind of a thug shaking state time
Take it to the next phase; you had your time to talk shit
Now bitches bustas getting checkmated
These days mothafuckas talk shit and turn snitch
When you see 'em they ain't talking about shit
(Westside!)

So so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (Comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades (Comrades)

See by now the way this shit is situated
Niggas is getting eliminated simply for being affiliated
Clearly stated and, man, I know you hate it
We got a whole list to play with
And y'all niggas is at the top, now let's make this
Happen, fuck the rappin', let's get to scrappin'
So niggas can see what happens
When you get caught up in dirty-mackin'
EDI'll send you packin', you know we love action
Sneak up on attack, pull back, let's the slugs snap-in
Your chest section, Death has now stepped in
Bitch should've learned your lesson
While your chance was still present
But now it's past tense, no question askin'
Out west it's called mashin', bailing the corner blastin'

Must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (Comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades (Comrades)

You must be so so crazy; bitch, I'll beat yo' boy bad
Driving in the truck with my black MAC
Thinkin' about the shit I never had, so I'm loading up one
And the two things that I cherish is money and guns
I love my ones, and I'll put blood on you
Snatch money from you, leave slugs in you
Ain't no nigga breathing fucking with Pac
Every album that he drop, nigga, number one spot, nigga
Locked, nigga, let me represent for my dead ones
Eat with my loved ones, squeeze when the beef come
Chill when the freeze comes, I do that shit
You think you heavy in the game? Watch me move you, bitch!
This Napoleon, why did I say I again?
You punk niggas already know I ain't for show
And I'll die for the dough, nigga, that's fo' sho'
Never die for a ho, nigga, that's a no-no

Must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (Comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed
Fuckin' with the midst of my comrades (Comrades)

Who I'm gonna call when a mothafucka feeling sad?
My mothafuckin' comrades
Who I'm gonna call when a mothafucka doing bad?
My mothafuckin' comrades
And fuck yo' bitch, ‘cause you a trick anyway
‘Cause my comrades was raised on pistol play
And boss playerism mixed with this thugism
So ain't no love in 'em, nothin' but the fuckism

Last verse is for them trick people, this is the sequel
I'ma treat you with evil, living forever illegal
Now homicide got me preoccupied
Be a lie if I told you that I never wonder when will I die
Be assured, nigga, word bond
‘Cause now it's on, you can only survive if you be strong
Until I'm gone I'll bust on Bad Boy
Middle finger to *Da Brat*, don't get your young ass smacked

You must be so so crazy
Bitch, I'll beat your boy bad
Standin' in the midst of my comrades (Comrades)
Bitches can't fade me
Plottin' but they ploys crashed

Turn up that motherfucking base
Aight

Yo One Nation nigga
Thought you heard nigga
One Nation

Fucking bullshit nigga
We got to get this motherfucking paper
Boot Camp Clik
Aight you know what I'm saying
Mad niggas want to talk about that East - West bullshit
But you know it's all bullshit

Smith and Wesson in this motherfucker, right now
Greg Nice in this motherfucker, right now
L.S. In this motherfucking, right now
Baby Jesus And The All Star's, right now
2Pac and The Outlawz
Got The Luniz in this Bitch

We got to put a lock on niggas jaws, so we gonna do it like this, check it out

Like lamp shades
Now they rant and rave
I'm raw
Plus I got more plants to blaze
Fiends came back with thieves
With files Long as Stant. Isle and back to Queens
We strap black Mac's with beam's
I'm tight fear
I'm that nightmare that killed that dream
My gat steam crazy buzz
I slit wit' wigs, plus some bid for your baby love
I'll play the role till I'm grey and old
Haha
With your pop's on the bed roll
No doubt
I'm caught out with your daughter
South of the border
Colt made them Outlawz

Check it out
Is it, money and women?
The funny beginnings tragic ending's
I can make a million and still not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinning, I'm hell bound
Rather be buried than be worried, living held down
My game plan to be trained in
Military mind of a thug lord sitting in a cemetery cryin'
I've been lost since my adolescence calling for Jesus
Balling as a youngster wondering if he see's us
Young black males
Crack sales got me three strikes
Living in jail this is hell enemies die
Wonder when we all pass, is anybody listening
Got my hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitching
Please god can you understand me
Bless my family
Guide us all before we fall into insanity
I'm making a point to make my beat bumping raw life
Drop some shit to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight
Now
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight

Chi-Chi bong water bong
'Nough weed for everyone
Enter the class now we kill you with sound
See bad boy with gun, who buss jus' fi' fun
Or black youth them move about a three ton
Soldier from jungle never take back free shot's
But that ended up at when man  fly

The impulse makes your body pulse beat off a beat per minute (Ohhhh)
As I get up in it
Construction no limit
Pin it like a cat in a dog fight
We gone get it on tonight
For all y'all who put up the wall to stall
But didn't realize that the weak would fall
The best pick out of the crop of MCs got rocked by the fact of realness
Stop, the shit, block parties was a thing of the past (Thing of the past)
Motherfucking club hopping was suppose to last (Suppose to last)
But all I see
Is niggas by the mass (By the mass)
Fuck even bitches came to kick some ass (Kick some ass)
But don't keep the club close that ain't my fault (What?)
Take them back to a grain of salt (To a grain of salt)
Take the indigence ever since BDI went solo (Oh)
I hold my cash  for a dollar

Let's, go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight
Go, Niggas want to get it on let's fight
I got some niggas in my click
That make them motherfuckers jaws tight

Up to bring them dukes up
Fuck niggas up 'till they puke up
Shoot up the party if they don't let me in
Get my whole click to let me in

I told 'em
I told 'em

Shut the fuck up
Your voice is hurting working my last nerve
Yo that's my word I'm about to take off
Break off a chunk of this trick ass chump
Who's knowing deep in his heart
He ain't wanting to see no funk
When he drunk
Yeah that nigga done go to him
Ran through him got him thinking he can ruin
Now he thinking I'm pursuing
Who's in, the motherfucking house
(Outlawz)
'97 we put some paw's on these motherfuckers jaws

I see the same old shit blame it on the jabber jaw's who blabber all nigga's business
Shut your mouth before I shit in it
I got the strength to make their jaw's tight don't forget ho's I got the game to make their draw's right
Don't go Hollywood
That's what they tell me
They bought my fucking tape but I can see that they ain't felt me
Heard what I said they started churpin' like birdies
Drunk off rum bumpin' gum's like girlies
Puttin' they lip's all on my Henn' bottle
Nigga slow down put on the brakes on all that chin gobble
Squabble squabble nigga this is Oakland Beirut
Stop opening up your jaw's thinking that this whole shit it's cute

But it's this I'm hearing
That young Napoleon is disappearin'
But I cancel that shit for I reverse on this clip
And leave you fucked left right something evil
All my life I've been trapped down by my own people

I'm on some shit to make your tummy's turn
Full clip's ready to pull quick
Fuck all that bullshit I ain't concerned
It's evident
I need dead president's the city slicker
Jersey jigger
Feel my residence from we turn

Talk about times is hard
Come take a trip down my boulevard
At your own risk
Got niggas that's homeless
But'll leave you scared

Trapped in these bar's of crime
Droppin' picture my nine hittin' cowards up from there feet to there spine
In this game all rules apply
With no exception's all niggas die living high
With no easy exits

Leave your body over chocking when this gat get to smoking
All you pussies from here to Hoboken
Leave niggas jaws tight",https://genius.com/2pac-lets-fight-jawz-tight-lyrics

Greg Nice

Old jealous ass motherfuckers
Yo 'Pac, baby what's up?
(They'd love to see me in my motherfuckin' casket)
What's up my nigga? Greg motherfuckin' Nice
(It ain't happenin')
That new?
, yeah
(That's one of them new Ben Franklin's
You're countin' there baby 'Pac?)
We gotta get our cash man, to do it
(We gotta get that money, homeboy)
We got the West side and the East side
Oh man, this is how we do it
East West, west east to south, that's how do it
They can feel it, We're the fuckin' realest, let's do it
(Ahhhh)

How we; Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
How we; Our own styles
Our own styles

Don't you love it? 2Pac free shit, that reach the public
Still I, believe my speech so deep that all my real niggas dub it
Ass naked rhymes in these cash makin' times
Got me losin' my mind inside the lines of these wicked rhymes
Label me a ghetto star, comin' up quick
Shit!, fuck what you heard, we be runnin' this shit
It's plain to see, my whole damn clique shine bright
Always knew the real niggas would end the shit when the time is right
Now East to West is irrelevant, we're doin' it worldwide
Ha ha, similar to bitches, like girls they hide
They die slow, when I ride low, bumpin' this beat
I bury, all bitch made niggas, comin' for me
I rock them to sleep, then evade the cops
I'll never go alive, 45 Blazin' shots
Still gettin' mine, livin' blind, search for salvation
Still got my guns, but I visualize 
One Nation
My work is done when my niggas get their cash in stacks
Get your ass on the cash checks, mash in packs
Forever ballin', the alcohol callin' me
And I still, bust on them all till they crawl to me
To all my Hip Hop junkies and my niggas in jail
When this song (HUH!) play give them Hell, my thug nation

HUH! HUH!
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we (HUH!) freak our own styles (HUH!)
Peep out how we freak our own styles
Peep out how we (Yeah) freak our own styles
Peep out how we freak our own styles

Enter; make yourself welcome! 'Cause E.D.I. is hostin'
Rollin' with niggas on the mash, coast to coastin'
We don't be boastin', no high postin' is allowed
Makaveli hit us a lick and we set to make 20 thou'
But it's all gravy, baby who does this daily?
It ain't amazin', real niggas trail blazin'
Man, stays in constant flow 'cause we gots to get it y'all
Always had a passion for cash so now it's gettin' critical
Digital, display relays that on this day
The East Coast/West Coast war is now history
Feel me? then picture me rollin' with niggas from Hoboken to Oakland
Puttin' it down more potent than that shit you're smokin'
One Nation!

Young Noble, I'm calm and casual
Bomb like the Arabs do, the end be tragical
Televised, I'm nasty new, the revolution comin'
What you gonna be shootin' or runnin'?
My crew was trained for gunnin', soldier state your name and number
We're racin' Hummers, tryin' to catch the sunset
We lace state runners, a handful of death threats
So what's next? A war plan and a strategy
Battle me to the death, there's none left to hell with casualties
We made niggas under trainin', trained triggers for the aimin'
Jersey claimin'; ain't a damn thing changin', One Nation!

Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)

Said what? - said what?

I been rockin' mics since Sergio Valenti
Down for my people just like Kunta Kinte
Got more Boricua mommies than Tito Puente
My man 2Pac picked me up in the Bentley
You come from the East, come to speak peace
Come from the West, bring the Buddha bless
Come from the East, come to speak peace
Come from the West, bring the Buddha bless
It ain't no motherfuckin' hair off my chest
Time is hard, I rock a bullet proof vest
Met so many yes men, so many yes
They try to gas my head like Hess
The heavenly father put me to the test
Divide and conquer what I do best
Ain't nothin' to it but alleviate stress

Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)
Peep out how we freak our own styles (styles)

Only in your minds (Yeah nigga)
Today we sign the treaty EAST SIDE / WEST SIDE

Nobody tryin' to be clashin' and shit
Motherfuckers tryin' to get their cash
That's why we mash in this bitch (Greg Nice, 2Pac and Tha Outlawz)

Equipped with the dick that's so thick, it fits sockets
Please don't misinterpret what I say to be dirty
Mothafuckas wanna jerk me, so they ugly how they work me, huh
A fuckin' freestyle frenzy for the funky, pop a token
Let me pomp it, kickin' the shit just like a donkey
So stay off of me, you killin' me softly
Mister Softee sweatin' that you lost me or toss me
I wish these niggas were smellin' coffee

Is reincarnation
Are you - are you afraid to die?

Reach the whole nation

Me? (
murderer

My only fear of death is reincarnation

My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard

Hard words is spoken, many promises broken
As if it's, useless to hope, they got me constantly smoking
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
I pray to God it ain't easy
Half the cops in California got a hard on to squeeze me
Running through the backstreets, hopping over fences
Tryna shake the fucking K-9s, running around senseless
I'll prolly be a mystery to many, but a legend to some
I've been a man for many women, but husband for none
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
My hands, holding my pistols will they serve us or die?
May God forgive me for my crooked ways, I didn't mean it
Knew I'd fall in love with money the first day that I seen it
Maybe now they can understand it's my occupation
It's clear that my only fear of death is reincarnation

My only fear of death, is reincarnation

I keep my shit off safety, I've been shooting rocks lately
Everybody gots they nickel-plates to penetrate me
I was supposed to be the murder first to go
Them niggas missing, grazed my wrist, I took it personal
Kato told me that I was slipping, got his strap and started tripping
Slipped two clips on the table, twist the L and said ""Fatal listen""
Everybody don't be missing keep your vest on, baby
And you know that shit that happens to the Teflon, crazy
You ain't gotta pack a gat, I got your backs keep your front line
Or we can stall that, from the Cadillac we about to bum shot
But Reeg locked down, (so) it's still begging casket
All we thought about was plastic and murdering bastards

My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard
My only fear of death, is reincarnation
I use my last breath, to reach the whole nation
How can they call me murderer for my spoken words?
This composition is my prophecy, I hope it's heard

I spend my days and nights, not knowing if it strays in flight
Gon' finally catch me, leaving my foes hella happy
'Cause look, at any moment, the game could be my main opponent
Niggas be swimming where the sharks in, and don't even know it
But I stay focused, concentrate on my surroundings
'Cause if I'm slipping, well that's when niggas will get to clowning
And I can't have it, I got a mission to complete
Raise my kids upright, make sure they got something to eat
And my daily ritual is, protect my physical biz
I just can't see now, I choose death before the penal
'Cause what good am I to that little nigga with them big eyes?
If I'm incarcerated, you feel me now I gots to make it
And If I don't, Re-Reincarnation ain't an option
Leave my ass dead until it's really poppin'

How can y'all call us murderers and shit and
Blame all the problems of the world on us young dumb
Thug Niggas from the streets, ain't that a bitch
How come y'all ain't giving a fuck about us when we was broke and poor?
How come when we get a little money, motherfuckers wanna stop us and block us?
What part of the game is that?
Who should we love, who should we believe in when the motherfuckers that's supposed to be our role models, supposed to be the people we look up to is tryna snatch us out of the game
What type of shit is that?
Fuck 'em all

I steal list for the top dollar
Just a true thug, Bagheera karma
High power, small timer, made nigga top grade
With a mean ways to play 'em these days, homie I'm saying though they tryna play me, so I gots to get them, hit 'em and lay low
I told you before, my only fear of death
Is momma crying for help, and papa tryin' to help
When I know we ain't got it, but shit I gots to handle this card
They handin' me, snitches, trick bitches, niggas who ain't us enemy
Never worry, apparently, I think I never buried
But if so, I gotta go my nigga's will always love me
Thug family ties, I know they want me to die
But I'ma survive, see the look in my eyes

And this Lemika and I'd like to give a shout out to all the tre whizz kids out there, Aunt Micky in the house, and I'm chilling up in the studio with 2Pac and Cocoa G and uh -laughs- okay I'm out..

How many niggas put a gun in your hand
Tell you to take what you can, while you runnin' with your man
On my order, you shoot, straight countin' the loot
You disguised in my boots, slip, and slide in the Coupe
Unorthodox trippin', catch him on missions
Styles twisted daily, weak MC's trail me
Show me how tellin' me, smoke me instead of jailin' me
You know it ain't no Fatal dog and ""J"" without felony
At the telly, they yell at me
Play me I give you one try
And I'll let you live long enough to let you see your son die
This evilness and wizardry Thug Life specifically it can be
Found as deadly as them bullets that keep missin' me
So what I'm 'posed to do
Just to open up your eyes and see (That's right)
You got it good all you have to do is ride for me

So tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me?, Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me?, Tell me baby would you ride for me?

It was a nice sunny day I was dippin' through the hood
Seen all my homies and it was all to the good
I'm Kurupt, the half-inch Villian cold chillin'
From the floor to the ceilin', and illegal livin' civilians
So much cash is in the bundles
Been there and done it everything you've done seen and ever wanted
I'm Kurupt, piece me up a piece of the pie
Many try but many die in attempts to ride
Who's the man with ten thousand plans got the grants
With my squad, we worldwide homicidal clan
So many stretch their arms out to touch my loot
But fuck 'em dog beware of the owner 'cause the owner'll shoot
Meet the dog in the worst way
And a nigga like me is tight on my worst day
I been boxin' the fuckin' mics since the first day
My eyes opened wide, and finally realized
Tell me baby would you ride for me?

So tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me?, Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me?, Tell me baby would you ride for me?

Open up my eyes, can't get up I'm feelin' weak
One too many nickies, take a quickie hit them streets
Pass the coke to me no weed, I'm already high
Don't need no Indo, crack the window
Bump the deck and let me ride
Niggas always fuckin' with me, 'cause they don't know
Named me crazy when I was a baby, I'm not that ho
Heard I was a Brood Lord, struck a nerve
I'm swervin' off of Alizé, so eat a word
This one in '96 for cruisin' off 
Hard dick thriller, still bitch killer
Fuckin' kibbles and bits, niggas won't admit
Got this industry on lockdown, ego trippin' I got tits
I got my crazed bitches, and get my shouts out
Catch you with your pants down, blow your fuckin' brains out
Steelo kind of sick, you know I be that bitch
And fuck Judge Ido, 'cause he can eat a dick
It didn't have to be like this to see you made me trip
So pull a bullet out your ass fool, ego trip

So Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me?, Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Tell me baby would you ride for me?
Would you bomb on niggas when they lie to me?
Now don't you ever tell a lie, just confide in me
Would you die for me?, Tell me baby would you ride for me?",https://genius.com/2pac-ride-4-me-lyrics

Another story of the territorial
Only difference from that one is this one is a-blazin' more of you
Have it and be ready, 
'fore the confrontation
I stand in attack formation
Find the borderline and bring together One Nation

It's time to flashback to tre bags, buddha smoking Lambs bread
Need another case, like I need bullets in my damn head
What's that you speakin' on, fly-rican get your freakin' on
Brothers get to blastin' when they realize that the weekends gone
Your speakers blown 'cause my base blows
Those lyrics how I lace them when I break foes
Now, we maintainin' players go through basic trainin'
Outlawz, bow down best the records out the game, set it off

Set it off on the West y'all
The party's guaranteed to be like habitable
Most of all last call for alcohol that last all night
We got beats so it's all right, we all tight
(That's how we do it from the West to the East)
(You wanna hit that)

Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all

Gettin' down just for the smoke of it
One Nation under a group
Nothing can stop us now

(Yo L what you dealin' with?)
I'm dealin' with that bullshhh
That off the wall shhh
That make that transmission start shhh
Well I was thinkin' along the lines
Ghetto rhymes, frontin' asses of all kinds
I ain't got the time for the Versace designs
Fakes ass crews claiming they controllin' crime
I think I'm finna show 'em what time it is
Greg Nice lets show 'em what time it is
Come on boy

I collect the dough like Reuben Kincaid
Been a Hip-Hop junkie ever since fifth grade
Early to rise, we gotta get paid
Sometimes I rock afro sometimes I rock a fade
Send them hugs and kisses to the girls across the map
Don't be shy, baby lay on my lap
Keep my eye open just in case of booby-trap
Slap me, baby, I slap you back, back

Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off
Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set if off, s-set it off, set if off, s-set it off

One Nation under a group
Getting down just for the smoke of it
One Nation under a group
Nothing can stop us now
Ha, ha, ha, ha

Set it off from the sunrise
'Til the skies turn red like the Beady Eyes
And the bees realize the allies
Reflect bullets like alloys
P-p-p-port-port
Yo G, D-O-G raisin' the flag for pen's who brag
But keep the heat up in the back
But they quick to get jet-lagged
They lag when they jet, when the G in the formation of a formed set
I bet, (I bet) thought the flame was lost
But the flame was tossed
To the boss dedicated to givin' the boys horse
Of course, take it out of proportion
If you with the course dedicated to floss the invincible force
Set it off

Set it off on the West y'all
Set it off on the East y'all
Set it off, come on now, set it off come on

Still Don’t Give A Fuck,Unreleased Songs,2002,"Young black male, I barely made my way out
I couldn't hack the jail, that's why I plan to stay out
I'm getting fat mail, 'cause that would never play out
And making rap sales, I gotta another way out
Jacking motherfuckers for a livin'
I know too many famous people, to be hungry on Thanksgiving
Hear me, nervous and ya fear me
See me at my shows, don't pose, nigga cheer me
Ain't the type to sweat cha, doubt if I'll forget cha
If you diss me wear a vest 'cause sucker I'll get ya
In a hurry, throw a flurry and you're buried
Punk tried to jack, I peeled his cap, now I be happy don't worry
I ain't that average motherfucka on the mic
Say what I feel, stayin' real, give a fuck what you like
I write the type of shit that get the crowd hype
And if you diss me, don't whisper, I'm the loud type
Bump your fist for a nigga named 2Pacalypse
Straight from the underground, nigga, we be droppin' shit
You can't fade me, you craziness smoked out
I get some drank and hit the naked then I'm loc'd out
Hey, provoke me if you wanna, I'm a nut
You wanna know what's up?
Ain't nothin' changed, still don't give a fuck

Still dropping more shit than a bitch (it's on)
Man I don't seen 'em motherfucker
Still dropping more shit than a bitch (it's on)
Man I don't seen 'em motherfucker

I give a shout out to my East Coast street folks
All you other motherfuckers get ya teeth broke
Tryna talk about the town like we country
But you jealous 'cause the next nigga's phoney
If the bullshit you speakin' never reach me
You best to reachin' for your pistol when you see me
Why? I'm from the Bronx, motherfucka, I was born to box
We can shoot it from here or we can pop the Glocks
It's on you, so nigga, what you wanna do?
We go 1 on 1 and call on your crew
Gotta crew so true that they lie for a nigga
That they keep their eye on a nigga 'cause they die for a nigga
It's so real, motherfucka, can you feel it?
And it's cool to hit the drink, but don't kill it
And my Poppa told me killers never brag a lot
I slip my Glock in my pants and let it sag a lot
I ain't a gangbanging killer or crack slinger
Just a Oaktown nigga turned rap singer
'Cause it ain't where you from, it's how you come
And a real nigga know another one when he see one
Here's a word for hoes at the shows
Keep on your clothes and niggas wouldn't call you hoes
'Cause how you gon' fuck the crew
Then get mad when them niggas get pissed to diss ya
Game ain't free, but I'ma warn ya, ya gotta be stronger
And make 'em wait a little longer
But I can't wait, so let me hit 'em
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em, quit 'em
'Cause baby gotta pay for the nuts
These hoes wanna know what's up
I still don't give a fuck

Still dropping more shit than a bitch (haha yeah nigga quite here)
Man I don't seen 'em motherfucker
(dont like you music, shut the fuck up)
Still dropping more shit than a bitch

I heard nigga say ""he hate the way I curse""
Now that hurts so um.. so this verse I'ma curse worse
Jump like a toe when you want some
Stick ya like bubblegum with the code name troublesome
They tried to ban my music 'cause the niggas is locin' up
Locin' up 'cause the niggas is broke as fuck
There's no love for the inner city streets
So you never find peace 'til we get a piece
Now that's deep, don't sleep, from ya dog's cheatin'
But how the hell you gon' help me from across the street
They forget about the brothers once they make it
Then get a mad at a nigga when we take it
Well you lookin' kinda cute in your three piece suit
But to people like Duke, you a nigga too
Get smart, how the hell we gon' be livin' cool
When the other niggas didn't get a part
Shit, look inside yo heart

Still don't give a fuck
Uh huh still don't give a fuck, still don't give a fuck
This for them punk ass niggas that don't know
Oaktown is on a motherfuckin'  and we ain't takin' little seats
Tryna and come out here talking that shit mad
Your ass gon' get caps hehuhu
It's like that nigga (tell 'em) yeah
Can't beat this shit it's a motherfucking phase representing nigga
All presenting
RPB is around don't fuck with them motherfucking niggas in this town

Sucka 4 Love (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"[Intro: 2Pac & 
Girl
]
Who’s that?
That’s  my cousin
If  it’s your cousin what’s doing all up in your bedroom?
He had to use the phone
Yeah right
I  love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

I  shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start taught me so many lessons
How  not to mess with broken hearts so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin’ at it, and now
The arguments are gettin’ loud I wanna stay
But  I can’t help from walkin’ out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you’re killin’ me with your jealousy
Now my ambition’s to be free
I can’t breathe, 'cause soon as I leave, it’s like a trap
I hear you callin’ me to come back, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Do for love
(Just to keep us getting through)
Sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Give up
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Do for love
(Just to keep us getting through)
Sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Give up

Just when I thought I broke away and I’m fellin’ happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who’s the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin' promises to you, tryin’ to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin’ on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin’
I’m bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin' up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin’ low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the do’
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin’, I’m a sucka for love

(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Do for love
(Just to keep us getting through)
Sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Give up
I’m a sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Do for love
(Just to keep us getting through)
Sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn’t always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry bout it we can do it now I’m under pressure (Don’t worry about it, baby)
Make a decision 'cause I’m waitin', when I’m alone
I’m on the phone (Yea) havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery (Yea), replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love

What you won’t do
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Do for love
(Just to keep us getting through)
Haha, I’m a Sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Give up (You know you ain’t right you know)
I’m a sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)
Do for love
(Just to keep us getting through)
Sucka for love
(There ain’t nothing you won’t do)

Tearz Of A Clown,Unreleased Songs,2002,"""
Start from the intro?
""
I can't though, it's gonna be too painful
To speak of all the evil obstacles my people came through
""
Equality?
""
Is not true, I rush to beat the curfew
I guess nobody told us that the people gotta eat too
""
The system?
""
I laugh, 'cause I don't see no truth left
Addicted to that crack or raised too high to fight for Yusef
Can't blame 'em, they slumber, come here ya Casanova
Just because Mandela is free don't mean the freedom fight is over
The beaches, Howard, Virginia and the others
Ya let 'em lynch the brothers and no one will love the mothers
""
Confused?
""
You shouldn't be, my facts are stated clearly
But my raps contain no ""wild thing"" so I guess no one will hear me
""
They're killin' us?
""
But what's new, 'cause nobody will yell out
They're all too busy livin' lavish lives of a sellout
""
The police?
""
A big joke, the only time their gun smokes
Is when they murder brothers after every bone has been broke
""
Huey?
""
A hero, although he never tried to be
Died and since his death he's still a victim of society
""
Well, what's next?
""
Unity, respect and love your sisters
We joke and call 'em bitches so the crackers try to diss her
""
We'll kill them?
""
That's not the way, it's time to use intelligence
""
Turn the other cheek?
""
Never again, it's time for self-defense
""
How come you're so angry?
""
'Cause I'm tired of bein' kept down
Now it's time to wipe away the tears of a clown


""
Why ya cryin'?
""
I told ya, I'm tired of livin' life low
The rich can beat the lotto, while the poor stay in the ghetto
""
The president?
""
Elected, but I don't know how it happened
Better qualified for rappin', with his gift for senseless yakkin'
A day for Martin Luther King, now his soul is put to rest
Turnin' over in the grave next to him is Malcolm X
Forgotten too quickly, it makes me want to hate them
Forgot about his wisdom, he's the latest fashion statement
""
Red or Blue, what set ya claim?
""
Does it make a difference?
One day we're gonna work it out and overcome this ignorance
""
Education?
""
Propaganda, taught to me in class
How can we control our future if we're kept from our past?
We better live a better way or we won't see another day
You can heed the words I say or don't and kiss your life away
Not tryin' to preach or teach, it is my wish to only explain
So many died before me, can I let their lives be in vain?
So now we've come to this point, it's time to make decision
Do we live in self-destruction or escape the realism?
They ask me why I'm angry, 'cause I'm tired of bein' kept down
My people, let's unite and wipe away the tears of a clown


""
What ills the children?
""
The future, for them, I see such sorrow
The least that we can do is let them live to see tomorrow
Too many have been killed, it's time to stand up for our rights
How can the people ""Fight The Power"", if they can't fight for their life?
Instead, they fight their wife, beat up if she's not silent
Time to fight for principles, the brothers get nonviolent
The government is so crooked and liberties a hypocrite
""
The Star Spangled Banner?
""
Just some patriotic bullshit
Destruction of the Panthers another sneak attack plan
Couldn't stand to see the strength and peace within the Blackman
""
Where are all the heroes who we thought were so untouchable?
""
I see 'em pushin' dope and rollin' 'round in BMW
How can it not trouble you to see a dyin' species?
The world must find peace or find itself ripped up in pieces
Afflicted with the teaching's, that make ya feel inferior
Some say the government invents it all, that they just scarier
Polly want a cracker, but cracker want a sister
How come they could see her beauty, but brothers persist to diss her?
Revolutionary generation on an uprise
Never will they see another tear from this clown's eye


Livin' the life I live, I have to be positive
Hell's my reality, I chose not to ride in it
I did want to live fast, I just wanted much cash
But punks were persistent, they hunted with gauge blast
So I wasn't the violent type, I had to protect my life
Lovin' my brother, but if he steps, I'mma shoot him twice
(song cut)
Psychotic society
It's hard to find love with those who treat us like enemy
They call me a lunatic, I say realistic
Beware of their politics, it's sick as the sick get
The son of a Panther, see pain in my mama's eyes
'Cause nobody thanked her for givin' them better lives
""
Assata Shakur?
""
Another auntie, I miss her though
Please thank Mr. Castro for keepin' her safe bro
How many more of us die before we can see the light
It's time brothers work it out, unite for a bigger fight
We're still in the same hole and now it's the 90's
Seems everyone's livin' large, but I ain't got mine G
But I got a bill for all the ill ya gave me
Society slavery, who's gonna pay me?

Boy!

That's my man throwing down
With rhymes that are so dope
Sucka MC shiver (Punks!)
They can't cope with these two MCs
That proceed to rock you
Ace, they wanna battle, man they can't stop you
Word, that's what I said, and it's a proven fact
That these suckas couldn't stop me with a baseball bat
And if I give them a bomb, that was nuclear-armed
They could shoot it at my posse, and we wouldn't get harmed
When I first wrote it down, ask ""Ace how it sounds?""
Just shook and said slowly and said

That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down

Who rocks from my side  streets
So we feed dope rhymes they'd buy
No one ever—
(Times gettin' crazy)
Joined the Born Busy posse (Suckas)
Taken us, and you'll get token out
On a stretcher with your microphone shoved in your mouth
Thinking back MC New York, do you remember that clown?
Who try to dissin' you, you got pissed and said—

That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down

Don't mean to brag, but it's like that
If there's a problem, we fight the battles back to back
If there's a challenge from a crew or a posse
No need to worry, I know Ace has got me
And that's my man, I repeat it 'cause I mean it
He holds it inside sometimes
I wanna scream it out loud to every crowd
I say it proud everywhere
Don't need a gun, my knowledge is right here
And that's my man
If things get out of a hand, we stick together
Through thick and thin, that's the plan
Yo Ace, let's shake the bass
So we place in this town
If you don't know, here we go

That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down
That's my man throwing down

 when I say, you know I'm a playa
So those suckas won't doubt it
That that's my man
Take that to the bank
'Cause I put money down the jeweller
Admit that he holds rank with
Whenever static get raw, I don't freeze but getting thawed
'Cause since New York is around
I don't have to look far, I keep the odds even
And just in case it gets out of hand
He say ""What's up"", I say ""What's up""
And that's my man
He like a barricade, no renegade can get through him
And for me, I guarantee that he'll go out on a limb
And since our posse was found today
I can say now we stand tall, never fall
'Cause—

That's my man throwing down
Yeah!
That's my man throwing down
Better believe it, boy
That's my man throwing down

The Hell Raiser (Original Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"When I was comin' up rough, wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now, and run with alcoholics
That don't explain the way I came, here we go
Just give me my dough and do the show then I'm outtie yo!
Runnin' in the back seat, sippin' on the Guinness
Fuckin' with a MAC-10 ready to be a menace
Time to hit the projects that's where the ballers dwell
Fifty niggas mad deep, 
I got my pager, my razor and a 'nuff jewels, a ruff crew
In case a motherfucka wanna bust through
I'm rollin' through the projects smooth, where they at? Where they at? There they go
Them bitch ass niggas hold down the block
The one that told  the cops I gotta Glock
Ay yo it don't stop - pop pop pop
Then hit the pedal, one less motherfucker in the ghetto
That's how we do it in the Oaktown, G
Fuck around and get smoked down, see
Niggas on my tail so I'm ghost
One way ticket to the East Coast
This kid was loose gettin' major
Wouldn't hesitate to blaze ya

The hell raiser
Hahaha
The hell raiser

Strapped with gats at a young age
Got a hold of a gauge, and made the motherfucking front page
High attack to the block like a cop
Open up an operation slangin' rocks
First I gotta get a crew full of hustlers
And fuck motherfuckers, them niggas can't touch us
And now we gotta problem come, you know my M.O
Dead bodies found in the Bronx
The other dealers wanna do me, I'm popular
Got the Glock cocked, sucker don't jock me up
Fuck a drive by, nigga take dead aim
Load him up in a frame and knock his ass out the game
Boom boom was the headlines
Young nigga turn killa in the deadline
Teamed up with some niggas from Queens
Now we're the loudest motherfuckers on the scene
Gettin' papes at a mad rate
Runnin' up on the fakes
And hit the snakes in a bad way
Them niggas don't want none, step
Fuck around and breathe your last breath
Run on me or get your ass capped
With a 12 gauge blast to your back
I'm not your average nigga, I'm untouchable
Shootin' motherfuckers full of rocks

The hell raiser
The hell raiser

Everybody freeze, niggas on they knees, hush
First nigga talk and I bust, trust
Run up on your stupid ass, gimme that
Peelin' caps back quicker than a snap from a jimmy hat
Picture that now, picture this I'm on foot now
Runnin' through the streets with my hit list
Pistol packin' and jackin' them bustas
Niggas want funk but the punks can't touch us
And now they got me trapped better kill me
Payback's a motherfucker, nigga feel me?
We runnin' on non niggas in the dark
Puttin' fully automatics to they heart (pull the shit motherfucker)
This is where the fun starts, niggas wasn't checkin'
Quick to hear me steppin', until I started lettin' off my weapon (buck-buck-buck-buck-buck-buck)
The shit I heard 'em niggas screamin' no, but they wasn't screamin' no before (no, no!)
Now them niggas, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go go
Hit the floor or feel the fury of my 44
Them niggas I don't trust tried to rush me
Buck buck double line in your guts G
And when I die there'll be another hell raiser crazy motherfucker
I came up with my criminal behavior, wouldn't hesitate to blaze ya

Makin' money is a must for me, I gots to have it
Cause you know my lifestyle is like 2Pac's, it's just so lavish
Just movin' on paper; movin', makin' and shakin'
Leavin' fools in a daze, as if, I was a Laker
Break 'em down and shake 'em, pass it off to 2Pac
And let him take a jump shot
Because he gon' give it all he got

Back in the old days, niggas was suckers, tried to belittle me
But that was when I was much smaller, just a little G
But now I'm a just a bigger baller
Niggas don't wanna see me, because I'm larger and taller
Made my money get bigger, bank account is larger
Niggas don't wanna see me
They label Dogg the father
When they see us on the streets, niggas scream peace
They don't want it
Cause they screamin' they ""Can't C Me""

Leavin' niggas on daze
Cause yes, money pays
Cause, if you ain't got it
Then it seems you out plottin'
Tryin' to do you a robbery, or some type of assault
But you just might get caught
But you know it ain't my fault
I'm gon' dip away and slip away
And find me a hideaway (hey!!)
And look for my nigga 'Pac
Gon' and take the ride away

Well I'll be right there homie, uh

Things R Changing/Words 2 My Firstborn (Demo Version),Unreleased Songs,2002,"Dedicated to those people that uhh
For some reason look at us like role models
You do know that things change
It might not look like its a cool world right now
It's cool though, things get better
Believe me things change
Tell 'em about it

Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind

Now, can you picture, young niggas in a rush to grow
'Til hard timers in the pen', had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw him comin' - too busy bullshittin'
Caught him with his mouth runnin'; ain't this a bitch
They got me twisted in this game
The Feds and the punk police pointin' pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong 'cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution-style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped
'Cause niggas died over bullshit - it's not my dream
I'm seein' pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
In our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin' times, livin' blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die before they got to grow
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
To my thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my firstborn, feel me
While trying to maintain through the pressure
Hustlers trying to make life better, for you and me
Nobody loves you when you're stuck in the game
But maintain, because all things change, feel me

Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind

Ever since my very first day on this earth, I been cursed
So I knew the birth of a child would make my life worst
And though it hurt me, there was no distortion
'Cause wild seeds can’t grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul
'Cause you know what you had to do
And so they victims of the world that never came to
I understand there's a better day coming
Sometimes catch me slipping with the car runnin'
Driving at a dead-end blinded
Ain’t no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died upon the table
Wasn’t able to breathe 'cause the family wasn’t able
Can’t blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
'Cause in the game things change living up and down
Hard life got me walking with my head down
Wearing frowns was it meant to be, was I wrong?
But I’ll never get to know so I carry on
It’s written for the young and dumb that wasn’t born
My words to my firstborn, feel me (feel me)
This for all the babies that died on the abortion tables
You know, all the mothers that didn’t have a choice
Things change

Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind
Things are changing, all the time
Some things you must leave behind

Thug Life (Original Version 2),Unreleased Songs,2002,"The question: ""Is it real?""
The answer: ""The Young Mothafuckin' Thugz!"" (Nigga!)
K-Dogs (That's right), Young Hollywood (Come on), Big mothafuckin' Malcolm (Yeah)
Representing on a mothafuckin' high level
These mothafuckas just don't understand me
They all family
Won't y'all niggas hit these bustas ass (What's up?)

What's up for '95? Yeah, '95 sound live!
I'm through with crimes, no more runnin' from one-time
Although I know I role I gets for my title
When I was young, that nickel-plated Four-Fifth was my idol
Chrome and stones, bones, and portable phones
Gettin' big hoes while I'm sittin' at home
Is what I scheme of, so now what I dream of
Is a life full of trouble, in fact
Countin' double digit stacks
Lay back for a minute, 500 SEL, yeah, I could see myself in it!
Murder for money, you ever heard of a dummy
With Glocks between his tummy, low down dirty and crummy
Talking 'bout that Thug Life be the only life I know
Talking 'bout that drug life without this rap shit
Probably be the only route I go
And matter of fact I know I'll strive through this fo' sho'
Live that Thug Life
[Chorus: Female singing &

Thug Life, it's the only life for me  (
A nigga live a

Thug Life, forever hustling in the streets (
I forever live a

Thug Life, when no one else was there for me (
I gotta live a
)
Thug Life, the G's became my family

Thug Life, ever since we was from day one
Licking shot, gettin' back and duck frustration
Live on rap is never my thought, I guess it's my fault
I told the support that nigga with his fuckin' coat of OLE
Drinkin' slowly, breath stinking tripped the police
So nothing that I'ma make snaps with the homies
And all y'all know where they whack
Throw a young nigga sho' don't like
Tryna survive through the strife with a fuckin' butter knife, you fuckin' right
I go loonies for my luchi whenever
I was raised in the craze, so forever thuggin' is how I stay
Collectin' pay and duckin' strays
I'm just a young thug rather see twenty and plenty more
the chip that I ain't ready for
So it's only right for me to earn my fuckin' stripe
Every day I fight, I fight
Livin' that
[Chorus: Female singing & 
2Pac

Thug Life, it's the only life for me  (
Nigga gotta live a

Well, some wonder with a real niggas
Run a few cents make me represent harder
No dough I can't bother Cuz
Don't nothing move but the papers
Where niggas catch vapors
More, more niggas doing capers for them
Stacks of Benz, me and my menz, it all means
That black Benz on rims and diamond rings
Make me think thoughts of all sorts in no lesser
Puffin' on 'port for the pressure while the
Sales fall, I starts ball to the floor
Get on the trick pool, punks are livin' wonderful
 'Bonic, makin' play a day
Blast away and I pray that a nigga lay in peace
'Cause I'ma leaves in the breeze with the reals
Get the slaps  I guess I gotta peel thriller
And my niggas never show me nothin' right
Now I'm hyped on this motherfuckin' Thug Life

Ain't nothing gon' change 'bout this game
Fuck the fame, all I want is the riches
Side-steppin' the bitches
And snitches they lay in ditches, dead, two to the head

On thug block, nigga we throw it from the shoulders? (All day!)
And we always drop boulders 'cause we soldiers, that's how we do it (That's right, that's right nigga)

So Aunt Glo
Why don't you tell them how we do it

I'm tired of these bitches calling my house
Asking for the Young Thugz

Stop calling

Now it's been a long, day
I'm straight hustling to getting pay
But now it's evening, and I'm scheming of play
I got a call, from that Dogg nigga K

And I was bored, so nigga I'll be on my way
Who got the hoes for Hollywood? I think he might
And I suppose, nigga we up in the night

That's right them  be staring
With Lil Moo in the cut and that nigga all in

So what the fucking drink had me tripping
But I'll be damned if I let another motherfucker catch me slipping
We've been in the car nigga

We in the drive way
Because the night is young and I'm ready to hit the highway
And now it's all for that
These night call's we strapped
You know how niggas be black

Now we smoking weed that we need
So let's get the game right
And baked tight in the late night

Preoccupied with
Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling
Don't sweat these hoes, nigga fuck 'em all
Everyday is a bit of play
Getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day

Now it's 206 tell me
Who the fuck I'm having sex with?
Gaming these cousin's in the Lexus from Texas

Expect to last past 6 'cause I'm restless
My head blasted off this Sess that I mess with

The best, click is who we choose so we making moves
Ain't in no mood for no faking moves
So is it true?
I'm asking now
'Cause if not, you and your crew could be stashed and out

Without a doubt
These bitches know we do it right
Fuck it and they suck us
That's how we do it on the late night

Bitches don't even have a clue
I creep up with my scandalous crew
Boxes of blunts and brew, well can you handle this too?
Step up and let me put this pimping in your ear
The game is clear, this place is packed, let's disappear
Now we can hit the highway and go to my place
But be cautious
Once we arrive can I toss it?
No hesitation, this fornication and situation
Fucking these hoes up to the attic, back down to the basement
No replacement, I hit you with a piece then I flee
Back to the streets is how I do it, ain't no peace for a G
And my motto, a blunt some coochie and a cold bottle
I'm fucking them hoochies and the supermodels
The game is deep, I can't sleep 'cause there's cum on my sheets
Sampling bitches like a break beat, the liquor makes me
And when it's late I'm like a convict that just escaped
Hitting these hoochies 'til they break, in the late night

Straight balling, can you hear the liquor calling?
Don't sweat these hoes, nigga fuck 'em all (In the late night)
Everyday is a bit of play, getting paid, thug nigga 'til I see my dying day (this is how we do it)

Would you do what I ask you to?
See I love to make you moan your erogenous zone
Any a brother in his right mind love to spend some time at home
Though your hurtin' I can feel your pain
Try to understand, we ain't all the same
Let me take you away, can you leave
Some place, to find true peace?
Let me be your lover, a positive figure
Take your mind off the times of fucking with the wrong nigga

I can't breathe, believe when times are low
It's like agony when I'm at home
Heart beatin' at a fast rate
Makin' moves in the nude
I imagine it's the moves that your ass make
Don't be shy, I can't lie
Pictures of me, inside you, want it so bad I could die
I've been possessed, so obsessed to undress you
No disrespect, but my aim is to sex you
After that live your life as my wife at times
You'll understand how I had to live my life of crimes
Come let me put my hands on your hips and move
With your hairdo bobbin' as we flip the mood
Give me good lovin', time to please
In and out, up and down as we grind and freeze
Put your back in the the motion and caress a figure
Make her ashamed for fucking with the wrong nigga

Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste
Of the thang's you've been missin'
Uh
Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' me a good taste
Of the thang's I've been missin'

Tongue kissin' in the strangest positions
Givin' you a good taste

U Don’t Wanna Battle,Unreleased Songs,2002,"You don't wanna battle (Battle, battle)
With me, whoa
You don't wanna battle (Battle)

Yo I can rock it on a slow tip
Don't flip, 'cause I can do this
No shit, won't trip, ain't nothin' to this
2Pacalpyse, now jack you better brace
'Cause I'm thumpin' it up and pumpin' it up with hellafied bass
If the comp rolls, throw blows until they back down
They sweat, no threat, suckers I smack down
No joke, I smoke any and all punks
They step, mic check and then they get done
What's next? I flex and rock the dope TECs
Get drunk, then run through crews like group sex
Get sprung, it's fun, I love to hear the hoes homeboys
Make noise from back to front rows
'Cause yo, I flow and go continually
2Pac, non-stop rippin' up scenery
So now, you know how I be rockin' shit
When I flow, same ho with the 2Pacalypse

You don't wanna battle, down with me
Nobody

Time to crunch and munch, your pussy ass see I had a hunch
You couldn't punch, I eat you for lunch
And go through, your sorry crew, I thought you knew?
You punk motherfuckers couldn't ever do
The things I, The R the Y—
The A the N Daz D did bitch, you couldn't ever fade me
I'm not a sucker, I treat you like a serious trick
You little dummy, you need to stop talkin' shit
You got nerve, I give you credit, to think you hang
But brother we're not all in the same gang
The punks, the suckers, the phonies, the perpetrators like you
Would never even fit in a crew
Without suckin' a dick, or maybe robbin' a bank
You see you don't got talent and your breathe straight stank ho Now step in line before I'm mad at you
You silly sucker ha, I thought you knew

Who would wanna battle, down with me?
Nobo-dy

Hit dropper, shit stopper with the strength to motivate
Give me a break, and then it's time to illustrate
2Pac will terminate, 'cause niggas like to perpetrate
Rhymes I create, yo you best believe they're worth the wait
So here I go, I'm about to throw a dope flow
And let them know 2Pac will hit you with a death blow
But you say no because you wanna battle blow for blow
I'm nothin' nice and my advise is just to let it go
I would just battle you but somehow I don't think it's fair
I'm not an amateur, I'll damage ya and leave you there
Anyway nigga I'm the one they want to hear from
Fuck that pussy shit that you be boppin' in they eardrum
'Cause in the 90's boy, 2Pac is comin' through
I'm in effect, snappin' necks, I thought you knew

Who would wanna battle, down with me?
Nobo-dy

You wanna talk about a battle?
Well I'ma talk about a massacre
You soft sucker, I'm tryin' not to laugh at ya
You and your posse, just stepped into the circle of death
You thought I wouldn't but the gauge, was in effect
I'm not a killer but I'm not exactly pro-life
Keep actin' stupid I'ma stab you with my girl's knife
I'm not a coward, punk I'll walk into your livin' room
Change the channel, and make you watch a cartoon
And if you step, I hope you pack a serious nine
'Cause if you don't, your sorry ass will be all mine
'Cause I'm a warrior, I'll make a fire out of a stick
Life in the jungle, but never comin' less than thick
You sorry maggot, you need to learn a lesson from me
The funky brother causin' trouble chief R Y D
'Cause I'm no sucker, I'm laughin' at you and your crew
You'll never hang 2Pac, I thought you knew

Who would wanna battle, down with me?
Nobo-dy
Who would wanna battle, down with me?

War Games,Unreleased Songs,2002,"Niggas playing deadly motherfuckin' war games (deadly war games)
That nigga rappin' about my motherfuckin' life!
I'm talking to you, nigga (fake-ass motherfucker)
The fuck you talkin' about
Let's get it on now
He got shot and left the hospital the same day
Bring the noise
When? What month, motherfucker? (Y'all motherfuckers soft as jelly) What motherfuckin' month?
Bring the noise
How the fuck talkin' about gattin' and shootin'
You ain't firm nigga, you soft
Where the fuck do these niggas live where all this shit be goin' down?
Soft ass nigga
Fuck your clique nigga
You want to know how I did this shit?
Bunch of skinny motherfuckers
You want to know how real my shit is?
Nigga, go read the motherfuckin' newspaper, you trick-ass nigga

Heyyyyyyy, huh
How many broke-down rappers got some shit to say?
I sit and strategize, in due time, them bitches pay
Plus all day, I puff weed 'til my eyes bleed red
Undercover tactics, leave my enemies dead
Check this, I know you niggas got no love for me
But how the fuck your whole clique turn to thugs, homie?
Like misdemeanors, it's a small thang
You niggas ain't ready for war, let my balls hang
Bust it, I took apart your whole crew, lack heart, I ain't concerned
I bust at Bad Boy, Mobb Deep and murder The Firm
When you scream ""Fake thugs,"" who the fuck you mean?
Get more cream than all of y'all, nigga, fuck yo' team
Now Dre want to switch sides, tricks hide in war
Last year, I'd shed tears, but I don't cry no more
Plus Jay-Z tried to play me, won't last long
Go ask King Sun how it feel to have your ass gone
Listen Doo-Wop, don't get your shit knocked, you can't win
Tell 'em all to let the games begin, we havin' war games
Yeah nigga, y'all niggas can't fade this shit
Got shot 5 times, got out of jail on bail
And sold 5 million
Sold more records then all you trick motherfuckers put together
More than the Firm, more than Bad Boy, more than Mobb Deep
More than all you bitch made niggas

Now won't you just, signal me
Before you try to take another one of my folks
Took they breath so they choke
And I know I did a lot of dirt
But grand said it wouldn't hurt
My death is comin', 'cause I feel it, smell it
When I work, did you see me
Comin' up I tried to take it easy
Plan at the wrong place, at the wrong time
I leave you with a broken mind
Ya whole block is fucked
Whole family is cryin', when the guns go bust
I went from Jersey to Cali, nigga
I seen it all, when niggas get they head busted
And didn't fall

Huh, yeah
I be that young nigga, EDI, Amin, huh
Rappers is fixin' to come up short
If y'all don't come clean
Check it, I'm at home watchin', shittin', sittin'
And I see some niggas on a T.V. line, what a pity
Ain't nothin' but a copy, of a copy
Reincarnation of an imitation, sloppy
Don't even know you got these white folks laughin' at cha
How the hell, you gonna base your lifestyle after a movie character
I'm dumpin' back at cha
Huh, fully loaded and you can quote it
Thug niggas casket is ridin' roll it

I'm hell-bound, One Nation
My destination is jail bound
Penetration to get ya niggas shot down, it's my town
Put your B'9s and Glocks down
Outlawz drop down
Shuttin' your whole spot down
We rock towns daily
Sippin' on the Baileys with thug passion
Mashin' with Mr. Makaveli, so tell me
Which one of y'all niggas want the war to be civilized?
Ill as Killa Keise and I be cockin' in your enterprise
Criminalize thoughts
When I be thinkin' draw fast, haul ass
When you see a nigga reachin' for what, the heater
Back streets I know, critically in Italy
Like Bellissimo
But down in Mexico, policio try to track me
Transform my Jersey army to some Killa' Cali
Khaki so Kadafi back me

Ehhhhhhhh yoooooo
They wanna strangle me and trap me
Angle to angle, blast me (ride on these bitches)
So you niggas can't match me (hehe)
When it comes to the chips (that's right)
We flip and cock back like a fifth
(Eh yo, Kadafi keep a gat on these, while I do it)

After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin' again
Time to make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, niggas that scary, get too near me we rushin'
Visions of over-packed prisons, visions and niggas thug livin'
Pressures, three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition in crates, shhh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin' for currency, the money be callin'
It's like I'm - dreamin', seeing scenes of me ballin'
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin' niggas pagers
Labelled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin' 40's, moved to harder shit
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no one
Nigga got my own plan, WATCH ME, uh

Ehhhhhhhhhhhh yooooooooo

Niggas watching for my pockets, planning plots on mine

Let my rhymes speak for me in history
A legend you define me
Don Makaveli bitch bow down to Death Row
Fuck what you say we untouchable
Now that we done shook Doc Dre

Yo, check this out
I need a verse from each of y'all and I'mma do a verse

So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

Mama raised me crazy
Critics should've killed me as a baby
Cause now I'm 21, you can't fade me
Yeah, I'm gettin' major paid, check my pager
Poppin' mo' game than a Sega
Sharp as a razor
Rollin' Cherokee and not a Blazer
Fuck the 5-0, watch for lasers
Infrared beam boomin' at ya dome cause it's on
One shot from the Glock and he's gone
Tell me: what goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty
Testin' 1, 2 , testin' 1, 2
Get a grip, bitch, come and get a whiff of this ol' slick shit
You think ya movin', but ya dreamin'
Nigga, ""Oaktown, Oaktown"" is what they screamin'
Uh, I'm doin' flicks
, gettin' rich, 
fuck the Grammys
Hand on my jammy, word to granny
What goes on

So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

I gotta ask y'all a question:
What's the point of a nigga steppin' to the front
If ya plan is on 'fessing?
And I guess that some niggas don't know
Frontin' like a bitch have ya size double-cut low
I know a bro who stuck like Chuck in the middle of some shit
Always over grip
Scratchin' and make a nigga kill his momma
Pimp his son, step to his boy with a gun and a stun
Need to think that I could be a goner
Victim of an old school OC from the corner
I remember the days you used to meet me by the school
Playin' flies up
But, now, my niggas beggin' wit' a cup
So, when I got paid, I hit 'em off well
My old school G will lie for me or go to jail
But when it came time to show a true color
He was ghost and I was lyin' in the gutter
Ayo, now what's goin' on

So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on

The funk is on, all day and all night long, poppin' cops
'Til they drop, sideways to the next spot
Got my UZ hang, extra clip
In case some punk bitch wanna rip, he can get some of this
I duck and dodge longer than fifty niggas deeps in Jeeps
Smokin' marijuana, rather die than be dishonored
Bustin' left at the precinct and leach down low
Peelin' caps, so they know who's in control
I'm gonna see 'em on the door
Ra-ta-tat-ta-tat goes my TEC-9
Can't barely miss with dip, it's payin' back time
Harder for every jail than some police and these hypocrites
Equipped to kick a nigga's ass, hit the drop, move a hat quick
Shoot a cop for every blow, wish Rodney had a fo-fo
Smokin' cops like indo
So, then, maybe their friends know
Straight outta Oakland
, pruck 'em, smoke 'em, make no tuck wit' 'em
Jackin' 'til the break of dawn
That's what really goes on

So what really goes on

Went to mutter I stuttered cause I want you that much
The situation is a no win
Cause he's my best friend
But now I'm guilty, I'm fallin' for his girlfriend
It's like a trap that I'm sinkin' in to
I wake up sweaty when I'm sleepin' cause I'm thinkin' of you
Then we make eye contact and I can't hold back
Tryin' to shake it but the feelin' comes right back
Now I'm confused, cause I'm no Casanova

Scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit, and pray hopin' the beatings will go away
It wasn't always a hit, and run relationship
It used to be Love happiness, and companionship
Way back when he treated you good
Moved you up to the hills out the ill's of the ghetto hood
You felt as though you owed him your life
It felt right so you said yes now your really his wife
He got you pregnant but the baby just wouldn't live
Something she couldn't give so things got negative
But that's when a stranger came through
And he's pesterin' you about the things you couldn't do
You say your happy at home, right?
But that's just a lie, as you cry through a long night
Until I came to rescue you, makin' you chose
What you won't do for Love

And you don't stop, and you don't stop, in the house, what you won't do for Love

Where U Been,Unreleased Songs,2002,"This goes out to all the young killers on the frontline
We ain't forgot about you, homie

A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone

I done been locked and jocked for the shit I've been claimin'
All that killin' and the drug dealin', shit them niggas gamin'
I dumped for real, Hoop Town gettin' ill
Force me to chill, 'cause they got shot and squeal
Punk ass niggas know the half on the ave
Through your town, and Downtown Newark, I mash

We call it thuggin', I ain't never go all of a sudden
L like I ain't wantin' nothing, then I just be frontin', buggin'
All my homies and my family, I put that on mother vein
Play by the summers it's goin' to be insanity
It ain't easy, to hold it in
When everybody around me is gettin' rich
Wonderin' where I been

Burned out and broke
Got me dead runnin' for two packs of boges
My whole life I've been choked
Since we graduated, bet you thought your boy hadn't made it
But it seem the dream that I was chasin'
Damn here is the thing that left me faded
Can't complain, shit, at least I'm still livin'
Although trippin' of all the fun that I was missin'
While I was boy is in prison—that's where I been

The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are
The homies wanna know where you are

I reminisce on dangerous summers
We're just a thug nigga workin' for drug dealers of neighborhoods
Run up by the age of 13
We was gunnin' and it was fun to see the police runnin'
Niggas disappear when we comin' little
Nappy head shorty addicted to drinkin' 40's
My niggas is naughty, and y'all niggas is fuckin' corny
But you left me in the summer of '89, a very good year
Crack cocaine sales rose in every hood here
'Til you got knocked
Then locked down, bag of rocks & fat knot
You shot down, what they tell me is you livin' well
Stuck in your cell
Don't get another slip, ticket, drinkin' liquor in jail
Just as well, hell nigga, I bail, whenever needed
There's weed inside of the cereal box so don't eat it
Where you been nigga? My homies wanna know
Where you been nigga? (Alone) Where the fuck you been?

A lot of things have changed since you've been gone
(Where you been nigga)
Damn, you been away from the hood too long

Hey.., to them niggas in jail cell
To my homies in the livin' hell
To the niggas haven't stayed down
To all the bustas that are comin' around
To all the love ones that's gone
To my niggas better stay strong
To all the hogs that's puttin' in work
To all the young riders doin' dirt haha

Damn, you been away from the hood too long
A lot of things have changed since you've been gone

Can't act dumb don't ask questions
To all the other motherfuckers who runnin' blocks with they Glocks
And runnin' from the cops and blowin' up the very spot

I'm sufferin' a bad case of lyrical congestion, not the one for testin'
Come mess with and end up with your chest split
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act, ha
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds up in the state of paranoia
I told him if you're scared, go get a dog
So by tomorrow, you'll pro'ly see 20 rappers walkin' with Rottweilers
Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent, you won't win wit' it, so limit it
Before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burnin' me
You found yourself bleedin' internally, now all you heads is learnin', see
I stayin' there sincere, you commence prayer
Your heart begets fear, 'cause there ain't no wins here, huh
Never kid, 'cause even with leverage
I can rock your domepiece worse than the wop ever did
What?

Are you out your fuckin' mind?

Ask me to blast, no need to ask 'cause I'm mashin'
Peepin' the latest fashion
Copy-cats and plastics get me to flashin'
My adversaries shipped in caskets
Murdered them bastards, witness the past, got boombastic
Now that they freed me, no one can see me
I completely eradicated my competition, Father forgive me
Assemble the troops, prepare my loots for combustion
Rushin' them muthafuckas, the deadliest nigga bustin'
How can they touch me when they lost in thought?
On Death Row we lock shit down across the board
Now flash and watch me get in that ass like a bikini
Lyrical legendary so niggas'll never see me
Completely defeat me, can never happen, whether rappin' or scrappin'
Niggas get smashed on they muthafuckin' back
Hard to kill, and even harder to stop
Watch Kane and 'Pac drop the sho' shot! Tell 'em motherfuckers

Here's how we'll do it

Let me  the plan to put the cash in the hand
So that I can spend a grand of Benja-mins up in Japan or  the Man
And therefore my Luchi, eatin' sushi
Checkin' out a subtitled movie featurin' Sho Kosugi
Tell me, Kane, when will niggas learn?
In this game, fuck with us, niggas gettin' burned
We takin' turns on you bitch-made nigg-ar-os
I hope it hurts, 'cause you're worse than these groupie hoes
Oh one more time baby
I'll be forever, the go-getter of the cheddar
Thinkin' ahead of my competitor, just too clever to sever
I got it together to represent with my true nigg

Am I Next,UnKnown,UnKnown,"They wanna bury me I'm worried
I'm losin' my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine
And my vision's blurry
Fallin' to pieces, am I guilty?
I pray to the Lord
But he ignores me unfortunately 'cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin' off Marijuana smoke
With every toke it's like I'm losin' focus
Fallin' to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin', and goin' nutty
And reminiscin' bout them niggas that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin' funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin' I discovered can't nothin' save me
My next door neighbor's havin' convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it

Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)

Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast

Everybody's dyin' am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin', two to the head
While I'm in bed, leakin' blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller?
Gettin' suspicious of this bitch the line's busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin' me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin' all her homies
That I can fuck her like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin' drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennessy, I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass

Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)

Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)
I see my enemies they creepin', don't make me blast

They wanna bury me, I'm worried, no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin' homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost 'cause I'm lonely?
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer? I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay thuggin' with a passion, forever blastin'
I'm bustin' on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound
Well Hell can't be worse than this, 'cause I'm in Hell now

Everybody's dyin' am I next (am I next)

Better In Time,UnKnown,UnKnown," I don't know why I be fucking witchu

Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit
Tryin to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin, what am I tryin for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin to get in my P's
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby, and there you go

Baby there you go, actin like a ho
There you there you go, actin like a ho
Baby there you go, actin like a ho
Actin like a ho, actin like a ho
HOE! See the word on the streets you're a
HOE! Just a groupie on a world tour
HOE! Now I found out for myself you're a
HOE! Girl you need to check yourself

These silly bitches got this game twisted
So I don't claim 'em, just bang 'em
Papa raised a player, so player, I play 'em
I got hoes that got more, hoes than me
So how I look, gettin hooked, like I ain't got G?
Truly cutie booty big, but that ain't enough
And the head make me beg, still that just ain't enough
When I don't trust her, the bitch be lyin too much
When she be dyin to fuck me you be buyin her stuff, ho

See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game

Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha

I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the starrrrt, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin loud, I wanna say
But I can't help from walkin out just a little way
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

I'm never gonna dance again, hahahaha thats right
Guilty feet have got no rhythm sucka for love
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a sucka for love
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given, a sucka for love
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm fellin happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back
To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on
Tryin to be strong and in the process, keep you goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin close
To packin up and leavin notes, and gettin ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin calls at the house, guess you cheatin
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin, I'm out the do'
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
Cause now I know you've been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
I'm never gonna dance again, hahahaha thats right
Guilty feet have got no rhythm, sucka for love
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a sucka for love
Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given, a sucka for love
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happieness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin, when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I'm a sucka for love

We wanna do shit like this...

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die
Baby please don't cry

Until I come to wake no one can stop me

It'll blow your mind
Hey throw up your legs
Wrap your shit around my back

While they seduce my jimmy I'll
Be screaming give me body

Give me my prides and don't cha
Love out these thugs nigga ?

I'm watching caramel bitches play
Get with real niggas bullshitting never get your pay
This is the dream of a young black teen
I think hoes cross-country like a greedy crack fiend
Now come on!
Verse-3
Though half our problems can be based on economical greed
And dying breed, addicted to weed
They're getting Gs
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)

Am I wrong? Niggas makin songs, tryin to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST! Then we ride 'til the sun come
Shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!

Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
BAM! Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin trick shot

I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep! Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell
How many niggas wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz

Do you think you'll ever get to the point where you can live
A normal, happy life?""
No, but.. I.. I'm goin' for it.. I'm tryin' for it
And until then..I have to make the life that I do live
As happy as I can and try to do the best with what I have
Do.. you know, live the best life I can live
Be as happy as I can be.. nothing is perfect for anybody
I don't think
Thug for life, feel me? (that's right)
I know it seems hard sometimes, but..
Remember one thing..
To every dark night, there's a bright day after that
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
So no matter how hard it get, stick you chest out, keep your head up..
And handle it!
Hold on..
I'll catch y'all up in the next life
We're in traffic
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to 'em bet
It's all good, uhh

I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And driveby's robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
Pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start
They couldn't tell me nothin', they all tried to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin' me down
And facing me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on

I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on

There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
Let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin' 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin' getting high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin' with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin' to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on

I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, you gotta roll on

I know them ain't tears coming down your face
When it's on it's on but wipe your eyes
In this world only the strong survive y'know
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
Welfare, AIDS, earthquakes, muggings, carjackings
Yeah we got problems but believe me when I tell you
Things always get better God don't like ugly
And God don't like no quitters
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
God bless the child that can hold his own
Y'know? You got to stand strong
And when these busters try to knock you out your place
You stand there to they face tell em hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop, Hmmm

Cryin', I've been lost since my adolescence, callin' to Jesus
Ballin' as a youngster, wonderin' if he sees us
Young black males, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin' in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin'?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's snitchin'
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my beat bumpin' warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight

Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight!
I got some niggas in my click that make they motherfucking jaws tight now
Go, niggas wanna get it on, let's fight

Mr. X to the you know me (Yeah, C'mon!)

The love's been lost, the gloves is off, so figure
What side you tryin' be on, the barrel or the trigger?
A gang of niggas talkin' the talk, but ain't walkin' the straight line
They tryin' to hide behind the one time
Fuck being scary and constantly with security
I ain't afraid of whatever you faggots try to do to me
Shoot at me, try to corner me, orderlies try to get at me
Flip it like fake identities, stickin' it to my enemies (Enemies!)
And have you runnin' for your motherfuckin' lives
Till they put me in a courtroom fightin' for mines
The only reason I got foes that used to be friends
When niggas mumble under they breath, I'm under their skin, so then
I pray for the strength to handle what my city bring
Better stand for something, or your bound to fall for anything
The pitfalls, the potholes, I spit flows that generate straight crack sales, we got those
One hitter quitter split a nigga like a embryo
Bring it to your crib, to your kids, to your video shoot
Give me the loot, my dues all paid up
The half-assed gettin' rat packed and sprayed up
You say what? Speak up punk, I can't hear you
You're transparent, Reynold's wrap, I'm seein' clear through
Pray for my downfall, talk like hoes
Mister rack rack the gauge and kick in the do'
And motherfuckers tryna say I couldn't rap no mo'
Like one monkey gon' stop the show
Lets go!

Fortune & Fame,UnKnown,UnKnown,"And my niggas say, we want the fame!
C'mon

One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame
One thing we all adore
Something worth dying for
Nothing but pain, stuck in this game
Searching for fortune and fame

Though we exist to breed, some believe currency comes to G's
Stress is half the battle, with success comes greed
They got me hot when they shot me, plotted my revenge
To increase my ends, enemies gettin' dropped
Win or lose, red or blue, we must all stay true
Play the game, nigga, never let the game play you
And for the fame, niggas change fast, that's a shame
What's to gain, lost souls? Who controls our brain?
Who can I blame? The world seems strange at times
Somewhat insane, I'm hopin' we can change with time
I'm livin' blinded, searchin' for refinement curse
I know, death follows me, but I'll murder him first
And worse yet, with each breathe, steps I take, breathless
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish?
Cigar ashes, toast with crystal, glasses
We mash on them jealous bastards, with my ski mask
I'm the first one to want him blasted
Wrapped in plastic, bullshittin' got his ass hit (Outlawz)
Ain't nothing left now, treated like a stepchild was not for me
Nothing but busters and bitches be rockin' beats, fake in fame

Some niggas be laying up in them streets, broke 'em off somethin' proper
Haters may try to take your soul cold-hearted ass niggas

Hatred,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I'll be on North side
Keepin' my peace back in my piece
Smokin' sense
To deal with this inner city stress
I know I'm blessed
But these demons are out to curse me
Do anything that they can
To try and hurt me
Good Lord whatever happened
To compassion and brotherly love
Cause now there's hate in every action
I try to maintain
Be a player in this game
But I seem to keep losin'
Maybe it's the strategy I'm usin'
Or maybe it's the friends that I'm choosin'
Jealous associates
Guarantee to cause confusion
Is it your goal to hide truth?
It's an illusion, develop my trust
Then leave me stranded in the bust
I feel like pullin' out my gun
And bustin' on these fakers
Two bit punks, perpetrators
And player haters
But I gots to keep my eyes
On the prize
Watch me bubble like champagne niggas
Watch me Rise
Beyond haters

I try to escape but everywhere I go to try and keep my focus
But a world without hatred, is like the projects without roses
No matter how high I get I can't escape the sense of it
And all you hatred ass haters always making me sick
I'm trying to find a place where I can go where hatred ain't allowed
To show everybody about money, and they all try and blow
I'm trying to find a place, where ain't no hating allowed
But I'mm always seeing them faces and hearing them haters screaming out loud
It's an average night and I got my windows rolled up tight
Blowing Mo out the sunroof and not a hater in sight
But I'mma keep my third eye open cause I know them haters gonna be waiting
To catch me at the light with hopes that they can leave me open
Preposition be the past but I know caskets still blast
So I'mma lean back in my seat so I can't be seen through the glass
It ain't nuttin' to hold me dawg but I got to watch out for
9 times out of 10 if it's 
And I know so I'm careful on who I run with
I ain't got no time to be combined in no scandalous ass shit
But everywhere I go I'm hearing what sounds like shot from a 44
Blasting on drivers side door
My niggas who sniff too much snow
And me I'm just trying to flow
Separate my friends with my foes
And only fuck with niggas who understand the mind 
So everywhere I go I try to stay completely separated from those with Hearts full of hatred for anybody that makes it",https://genius.com/2pac-hatred-lyrics
I Tried,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Got me thinking about better days...

Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smoking weed like it ain't no thang
So even kids wanna try now
They lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons
Addicted to hearin victims screaming
Guess we was evil since birth
Product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops
The only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets
It ain't the same
Too many murders
Too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried
Plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith

Who would've guessed that in my future years
I'd be stressing, some say the ghetto's a sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Try to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin yayo all day long
But they wrong, so I'm solo and so broke
Saving up for some Jordan's cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too
And so am I. I can't take her to places she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
But what can I say, keep yo' head up and
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith
Try to keep the faith

Square fools, since back in high school
We was true, me and you hardly parted or separeted
We stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbanger and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressing like grown men when rolling
I went to dark, smoking Newports, gaming marks
Got a place in my heart, homie stay smart
Locked you up in the penn'
And gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hoping you well, I know it's hell doing time in the cells
You need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doing cool
I settled down, had a family
Working in night school
Every once in a while
I reminisce and wonder how we ever came to this",https://genius.com/2pac-i-tried-lyrics
Last Kings,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Death Row, that's where motherfuckers is endin' up

Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Niggas gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now imma dime off yo' ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow. turn em into forty-niners

Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me? 16 on Death Row

Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggas countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row

They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this doc
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers

Silenced shares we moving, The evil go ahead a movement
Or share me the spiritual form, hear us form rebellion

That's right.. Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that past away
Makaveli in this.. Thats how you do that shit..

They got a nigga
Shedding tears, reminiscing on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutching on a 4.5

They tell us that we hopeless and hell bound
This for the brothers in penetentiaries jailed down
Homies in every city definition of power
Its a thugs wrath. Can you feel me now?

Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black males living Hell when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went

They tell us that we hopeless and hell bound
This fo the brothers in penetentiaries jailed down
Homies in every city definition of power
Its a thugs wrath. Can you feel me now?

And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hanging out picking up game, sipping cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hoping I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, staying strapped
Fantasies of a nigga living phat, but held back

They tell us that we hopeless and hell bound

Tell the homies I'm in heaven and it ain't got hoods

It had me shook
Drinking peppermint schnapps with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cook
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin there kickin it with Malcolm till the day came
Lil' Latasha sure grown, tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven
So come home
Maybe in time you'll understand, only God can save us
Where Miles Davis cutting lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past that passed on
They in heaven found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep dear God what I'm asking
Remember this face, save me a place

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide

A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's for me
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac .11's swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain


My niggas crooked though it seems
My every single thought is caught up in collecting cream
A made nigga; picture me dying in a blaze of gun fire
Will not retire til I'm paid, turn the base up higher
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 125, and Do or Die
Rolling with niggas from Long Beach to Long Isl'
I hardly smile cause my heart froze
Once I; commence my show rip apart foes
And now I, got One Nation it's a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit, let's get back to money making
Tell them busters that I rolled on controlling the house
My shit is so wicked when I flip, niggas closing their mouth
The Cocoa Brovaz, Buckshot the BDI Thug
Greg Nice, L.S., Asu, so show a nigga love, Outlaw!",https://genius.com/2pac-war-zone-lyrics
Who Murdered Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"You may remember hearing about a murder
In Las Vegas 2 months ago
In which a popular and controversal performer
Was shot
Gang land style and killed
It's a murder that hasn't yet been solved
But the investigation has invited closer scrutiny
Of the music industry
(Fades away)

Them same mother fuckers wanta murder me
Them same mother fuckers
Them same mother fuckers wanta murder me
(Y'all mother fucking crazy)

Crazy
I got a work with what you gave me
Claiming I'm a criminal
When you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this holocaust
Heading for my grave G
I told Sam he can fuck the war
& got a busted jaw
For saying fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm Mad check the records
What's a nigga got a do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm Getting tested
& if I dont say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zested
I keep a vest on my chest
Incase the cops are getting restless
Walk around ready to light shit up
& since my life is fucked
Some say I'm slighty nuts
Buck buck is the sound as i mooova
Other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer
I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see whooo's realer
Now them same motherfuckers want a murder me
& i wonder if the lord ever heard of me
Chorus
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me
(they know everyday when I'm breathing it's it's...)
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me
(Everytime i speak i want the truth to come out)
Them same mother fuckers want a murder me(You know what I'm saying everytime i speak i dont want shit)
& i wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot so I'm doing what i do
& don't say shit
Until you've walked in my shoes

Wish The Best For My Enemies,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yeah, BK Brooklyn went massive on the track ya'll
Uh, Makavelli rest in peace, huh Oulawz whaddup
Fatal Hussein, EDI Mean,(Yeah) gorilla gang, bangin' smurf domination
(You KNOW!) Heh, you know how we do it

Just holla my name and witness game official
Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn'ta tried me
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls better, eat a dick BEYOTCH!
Mercy, never that, you say you comin' back?
Bring it on, forever strapped
Introduce you to the pleasure and the pain, you can go so far
Just sell me your soul, and live the life.. (of a ghetto star)

I wish nothing but the best for my enemies
I know they wanna see me descended n even when im dead
They don't wanna see me in peace
They'd rather see me suffer a lifetime of trice
When I'm gone jealousy is the same old song
I wish nothing but the best for my enemies
I'mma warrior born to survive the struggle
Its a game of tug of war you gotta hustle

You see the road that I quarrel is long and hard
Physical and mental scars
Wishin' for paradise in a place where I'm against the odds
Rough nights then gun fights had me on the edge of death
But some how some way god chose to spare my breath
When my enemies succeed in my assassination
Thoughts of death is it the future of my imagination
Before they put me in the dirt I'm squeezin' first
Hate to see my mama cry following behind my hearse
Nothin' worse I can't picture myself sayin they shot me
Cause even when I think I'm alone, god got me
Throughout life I learned a lot of valuable lessons
Invest in the future you can't take a fortune in heaven
Friends changed so I walk on my weapons
So let me come for ME
I'm patiently waitin' to put em under me
A ghetto star just trynna live my life comfortably
Bein' harassed and attacked so whatchu want from me


Check yourself you gotta snatch some collars
And let them motherfuckers know you gonna take them OUT
Anytime YOU feel like it
You gotta get the ground beneath your feet partner
And get the wind behind your back and go out and blaze if you got to
You gotta be ready to throw down, stand up and die for that
Otherwise you ain't shit, you might as well be dead your damn self

Talkin' to my homies that was worried
See my enemies wanna see me dead I ain't worried forgive me
Please give me shelter, guard my friends
Lift up my head from my hands that are warm with tears
I see bodies gettin' splashed with acid
2 shots ring from the plastic Glock wrapped in plastic
Buried n basted time to notify
His fam wishin', ain't nothin' left to be identified
Evacuate the crime seen fast, Why
Heard the feds that are wanted for my ass, Why
I won't touch down till I see do you wanna
Sell out shops, sellin' em crooked counts marijuana
Label me a success
I made a switch, retired from the life that never gave me shit
Went from cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, live my life as a ghetto star

Yeah man, GF Records man, fire whaddup
Haha my nigga empho lookin for this one ya'll
Gorilla gang man, 2Pac rest in peace man
We got this man, 2004 shit man
This shit from the heart ya'll
Huh, I wish the best for my enemies
Brrrrrraaaaaaaahhhhh",https://genius.com/2pac-wish-the-best-for-my-enemies-lyrics
