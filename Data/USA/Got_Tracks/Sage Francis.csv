The Best of Times,LI(F)E,2010.0,"It's been a long and lonely trip
But I'm glad I took it because it was well worth it
I got to read a couple books and do some research before I reached my verdict
Never thought that I was perfect
Always thought that I had a purpose
And I used to wonder if I'd live to see my first kiss
The most difficult thing that I did was recite my own words at a service
Realizing the person I was addressing
Probably wasn't looking down from heaven
Or cooking up something in hell's kitchen
Trying to listen in or eavesdrop from some another dimension
It was self-serving just like this is
Conveniently religious on Easter Sunday and on Christmas
The television went from being a babysitter to a mistress
Technology made it easy for us to stay in touch while keeping a distance
'til we just stayed distant and never touched
Now all we do is text too much
I don't remember much from my youth
Maybe my memory is repressed
Or I just spent too much time wondering if I'd live to have sex
Fell in love for the first time in 4th grade
But I didn't have the courage to talk to her
In 8th grade I wrote her the note but I slipped it in someone else's locker
Considered killing myself because of that
It was a big deal
It was a blown cover
It was over for me
My goose was cooked
Stick a fork in me
The jig is up
I blew my chances, the rest is history, our future was torn asunder
It became abundantly clear that I was only brought here to suffer
At least I didn't include my name
Thankfully I wrote the whole note in code and it had 10 layers
Of scotch tape safety seal making it impossible to open
Plus, it was set to self destruct
Whoever read it probably died... laughing
I wonder if they lived long enough to realize what happened
A year later, I came to understand that wasn't love that I was feeling for her
I had someone else to obsess over
I was older
And I was very mature
I forged my time signature while practicing my parents autograph
Cause I was failing math
Disconnected the phone when I thought the teacher would call my home
I checked the mailbox twice a day at the end of a long dirt road
Steamed open a couple envelopes like I was in private detective mode
If you snoop around long enough for something in particular
You're guaranteed to find it
For better or worse that's how I learned
That it's best to just keep some things private
It was the best of times
It was the end of times
It was the best of times
It was the end of times
I was always on deck, I was next in line
An only child with a pen and pad
Writing a list of things that I could never have
The walls in my house were paper-thin
Every squabble seemed to get deafening
If my memory serves me correctly I made it a point to void and forget some things
Probably to keep from being embarrassed
Never meant to upset or give grief to my parents
Kept my secrets... hid my talents...
In my head, never under the mattress
Therapy couldn't break me
Never learned a word that would ensure safety
So I spoke softly and I tiptoed often
The door to my room was like a big old coffin
The way that it creaked when I closed it shut
Anxieties peaked when it opened up
As if everything that I was thinking would be exposed
I still sleep fully clothed
It was the best of times
It was beautiful
It was brutal
It was cruel
It was business as usual
Heaven
It was hell
Used to wonder if I'd live to see 12
When I did I figured that I was immortal
Loved to dance but couldn't make it to the formal
Couldn't bear watching my imaginary girlfriend bust a move with any other dudes
Tone Loc was talking bout a ""Wild Thang"" but I was still caught up in some child thangs
Scared of a God who couldn't spare the rod
It was clearly a brimstone and fire thang
Pyromaniac
Kleptomaniac
Couldn't explain my desire to steal that fire
Now I add it to my rider
Like ""Please oh please don't throw me in that patch of brier!"" It was the best of times
It was the end of times
The school counselor was clueless cause I never skipped classes
Perfect attendance
Imperfect accent
Speech impediment they could never really fix and I faked bad eyesight so I could wear glasses
Considered doing something that would cripple me
I wanted a wheelchair
I wanted the sympathy
I wanted straight teeth so then came braces
4 years of headgear helped me change faces
It was the best of times
It was the end of times
Now I wonder if I'll live to see marriage
Wonder if I'll live long enough to have kids
Wonder if I'll live to see my kids have kids
If I do I'm gonna tell 'em how it is
""Don't listen when they tell you that these are your best years
Don't let anybody protect your ears
It's best that you hear what they don't want you to hear
It's better to have pressure from peers than not have peers
Beer won't give you chest hair
Spicy food won't make it curl
When you think you've got it all figured out and then everything collapses
Trust me, kid
It's not the end of the world.""",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-the-best-of-times-lyrics
Sea Lion,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song
Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song

Ma, Ma, look what I did, Ma
Look what I did to my hands, I broke em
You gave me the stone, gave me the chisel
Didn't say how to hold em
Didn't say give away every piece of the puzzle
Till I was left with nothing
But I took it upon myself to crush it up and distribute the dust
Get in the bus, hop in the van
Jump in the water, crawl to the land
Build another castle out of the sand
Break it down and then I get into the saddle again
Going city to city I'm already lost, tell the boss
Who is new in town
I'm-a ride this horse till it bucks me off
And I'm forced to shoot it down
I'm-a take him out for some gasoline
I'm-a trade this cow for some magic beans
Make Mom proud of the deals that I've made
Cause I'm just a modern day Johnny Appleseed
But I'm glad that I never passed the genes
And I never put down the axe
Piano Man got a checkered dance floor
To grace and the painful look on his face
Cause the crowd is packed and the louder they clap
The less he is able to make the connection
Between what he sees when he hears certain notes
And the hurt that is shown in his facial expression
I don't need your go-ahead to go ahead
No, I know no one said it was gonna be easy
But sweet Jesus, who wants to sleep with me?
Way too many moves to learn
But not enough people to put em on
Lookit, Mom, no hands
I built this suit of armor with wooden arms

Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song
Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song

Oh God I think I'm dead
I can't see outside my head
Brains and bloods and cryptic gang men
Czars and warlords breaking bread
Thoughts are thought
What's said is said
I thought that 'fore you said it
I didn't mean to think out loud
My tongue slipped but who let it?
Let it be, let me be, let me go, nah let me out
My manhood nods and whispers when my father screams and shouts
Dear dad I'm sad you're dead
A new man standing in the pulpit
He bows before a wooden cross and forces praise the culprit
I'm a tenor in the choir but I sing a different song
Of how the where's and why's of now all prove I don't belong
But I'm staying I've planted seeds and plan to watch them grow
I've watered all my wishes dreams fulfilled more seeds to sow
And I promise to learn to love the way I've learned to fear
To unknot all the inhibitions tangled in my hair
To let my ego mound in piles around the barber chair
And make a graceful exit from my vexed and troubled years
I've decided I've been invited to my own resort
Where knights can leave their armor neatly piled by the door
And every woman, child, and man will gather by the shore
And study how sea lions swim in cursive

Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song
Force of my love was strong
The sea lion laying down long
A song in the air
Why should singer care
When singer can be among song",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-sea-lion-lyrics
Slow Down Gandhi,A Healthy Distrust,2004.0,"There once was a song called ""Arrest the President.""
Contemporary music, a hit with the kids, it was a top ten
I wasn't pop then, so I missed the bus a bit
But politics, it was on everybody's ""hot this summer"" list
The cool kids were all rocking votes
I shit you not, I was pistol whippin' cops for hip hop (Booyea!)

On my soapbox yelling into megaphones
Killing hard rocks, using carcasses as stepping stones
Had to promise that I'd stop holding my marches
The day that Chris Columbus got crucified on golden arches
My pedestal was too tall to climb off
In fact that's the reason for the high horse
And from up here I see marines in hummers on a conquest;
Underdogs with wonderbras in a push-up contest
All for the sake of military recruitment
It felt like Kent State the way they targeted the students
I galloped off whistling ""Ohio""
The rest of them, stuck doing stand-up at a cricket convention
Who would they die for?
Is it the same machine that leaves the quality of life poor?
An abominable colony of cyborgs?
Clogging up the property that I bought with eyesores?
That clever ad campaign ain't worth
The time taken from minimum wage labor
I don't care how half-naked or fake she looks
She smells like dirty cash and aged paper books
Who would she die for?
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
Slow down, Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
Now it's whistle blower versus the pistol holder
Case dismissed, they'll lock you up and throw away the key witness
Justice is the whim of a judge, check his chest density
It leaves much room for error, and the rest left to destiny
The West Memphis Three lost paradise
It's death penalty versus suicidal tendencies
All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi
Institution
Making you think you're crazy is a billion-dollar industry
If they could sell sanity in a bottle
They'd be charging for compressed air
And marketing healthcare
They demonize welfare
Middle class eliminated
Rich get richer 'til the poor get educated
But some of y'all still haven’t grown into your face
And your face doesn't quite match your head
And I'm waiting for a brain to fill the dead space that's left
You're all, 
""Give me ethnicity or give me dreads""
Trustafundian
 
rebel without a cause
 
for alarm
Cause when push turns to shove
You jump into your forefathers' arms
He's a banker, you're part of the system
Off go the dreadlocks, in comes the income
The briefcase (The freebase)
The sickness (The symptom)
When the cameras start rollin' stay the fuck outta the picture, pilgrim!
The briefcase (The freebase)
The sickness (The symptoms)
When the cameras start rollin'...
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
Mr. Save-the-World, spare us the details
Save the females from losing interest
And Miss Save-the-Universe
You're a damsel in distress
Tied down to a track of isolated incidents
Generalize my disease
I 
need a taste of what it's like
Living off the fat of kings
I play the scab at your hunger strike
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
One love, one life, one too many victims
Republicrat, Democran: one-party system
Media goes in a frenzy
They're stripped of their credentials
Presidential candidates can't debate over this instrumental
Let 'em freestyle, winner takes all
When the music’s dead, I'll have Ted Nugent's head hangin' on my wall
Kill one of ours, we'll kill one of yours
With some friendly fire, that’s a funny term, like civil war
Six in the morning, police at my crib
Now my nights consist of two toothpicks and eyelids
The crucifix and vitamins, music that is pirated
New-flavored food made of mutated hybrids
Uh, they tell me that it's not that bad
It fucks you up good, but it's not that bad
They hold on to these tales 'til it's the dog that wags
God save us all if he lets the cat out the bag
 (cCat out the bag)
Who's the one to blame for this strain in my vocal chords?
Who can pen a hateful threat but can't hold a sword?
It's the same who complain about the global war
But can't overthrow the local joker that they voted for
They call the shots
But they're not in the line of fire
I call the cops
But they're breakin' the line of duty
Let's call a stop to the abuse of authority
The truth keeps callin' me, and I'm a live to tell the story
So look for truth, quit seeking forgiveness
You need to cut the noose, but you don't believe in scissors
You support the troops by wearing yellow ribbons?
Just bring home my motherfuckin' brothers and sisters
Cause they don't call the shots
But they're in the line of fire
I'd like to call the cops
But they're breakin' the line of duty
It's time to call a stop
To the abuse of authority
The truth keeps calling me
And I'm a live to tell the story

Meadow Superstar, that is what you are
Coming from a farm, reaching with your arm
Come away with me to another ranch
We can rely on a tree branch

Makeshift Patriot,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001.0,"I’ve heard enough of you young fellas, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you’re waving the damn flag
Frank, what’s up man?
Watchin' some bullshit, on the news
Fuckin' bullshit. Reporters, tryin' to win a fuckin' Emmy

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself via live telecast
Coming live from my own funeral
Beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever-altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalistic ethics slip when I pass them off as objective:
""Don't gimme that ethical shit.""
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable American kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is
That's exactly what they attacked when a typically dark-skinned Disney villain
Used civilians against civilians and charged the Trojan horses into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
Now I have to backpedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering how after it settles we'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The Melting Pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil
 
so the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home. We won't wait till he's older
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
""Now get a close up of his head""

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash
The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some other pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making decisions to jump!
While holding hands, to escape the brutal heat
Sometimes in groups of the three
The fallout goes far beyond the toxic cloud where people look like debris
But all they saw after all was said, beyond the 
talking heads
Was bloody dust with legs looking like the walking dead calling for meds
Hospitals are overwhelmed. Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for fire fighters were interupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call to increase an unknown death toll?
It's the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone
, and he's promising to make heads roll
So we cheer him on
, but 
asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate. The easier it is to sell souls
Talking Interlude:
""There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made: No more curbside baggage
7PM curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We’ve unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote, remember; our God is bigger, stronger, smarter and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part""
We sell addictive 24-hour candlelight vigil in TVs
Freedom 
will
 be defended at the cost of civil liberties
Viewers are glued to television screens
Stuck, cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heart strings for theme music
I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at
, 
and what foot is right to kiss
We don't know who the culprit is yet, but he looks like this
We know who the heros are. Not the xenophobes who act hard
""We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard!""
They happened to scar our financial state and char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back this same damn tape?
While a cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats on the West Bank
With a ten-second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst
So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
Because even if we win this tug of war and even the score, humanity struggles
There's a desperate need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble
Some of them dug for answers in the mess, but the rest were looking for trouble

Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half-mast
It's the makeshift, the patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself, don't waive your rights with your flags",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-makeshift-patriot-lyrics
Grace,Copper Gone,2014,"Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace
Grace is a little girl who wouldn’t wash her face
Grace is a virtue, virtue is a mean
Between two extremes, one of excess, one of deficiencies
Patience is a virtue, virtue is a dirty stain
Cleanliness is next to godliness and isn’t worth the pain
Grace is a virtue, 
virtue of the pageant
And this is not a love ballad

You suggested Lithium to get me better again
That is unless if we, uhm, get together again
But that ain’t gonna happen, never again
Send my well wishes to your nutritionist
Your dietician, your pharmacist
Your personal trainer and your accomplices
Your partners in thought crime
Your criminal groupthink and doctors online
There is a difference between what is and isn’t
Business and friendship
Parental assistance and an assistant
A permanent solution and a quick-fix
A fit body and sound mind
A hundred hour weeks and dangerous amounts of downtime
You got a lot to offer, but you’re not an author
If I kill your persecution complex that don’t make you a martyr
Drop the styrofoam cross, you can’t walk on water
You could use it for floatation, not a flying saucer
You suggested professional help like I wasn’t mentally well
What I was feeling wasn’t meant to be felt
Duly noted, you’ll be quoted in the eulogy
It’ll be passed off as poetry, between you and me
I know you know the difference between confession and conjecture
Prosody and needing to be lectured to a meter
The student becomes the teacher, the son becomes a parent
From a scab to teamster, the sun becomes apparent
From a chemical imbalance to a litany of habits
And this is not a love ballad

You should drown me in that womanhood or teach me how to swim
Beat me with my own hands or tie down my limbs
Suffer for my sins or let me suffer from within
But in the end 
this is not a love ballad
We can battle with tattoos to cover up the bruises
The first to show any sign of discomfort loses
For the first time in a long time you’re not who my muse is
And this is not a love ballad
I’m not thirsty, I just got hungry eyes and you look appetizing
From a distant stare, broken eye contact in disrepair
Sometimes I disappear. Oh, now you see me?
I'm part Irish Goodbye, other part Harry Houdini
Put my feet to the fire, I've got Satan on my heels
If it’s all about prestige, just wait for the reveal
I've got a new bag of tricks to turn, a new black magic woman witch to burn
So much for live and learn

Patience is a virtue, virtue is a grace
Grace is a little girl who wouldn’t wash her face
Grace is a virtue, virtue is a mean
Between two extremes, one of excess, one of deficiencies
Patience is a virtue, virtue is a dirty stain
Cleanliness is next to godliness and isn’t worth the pain
Grace is a virtue, virtue of the pageant
And this is not a love ballad

It's a music box that haunts me from the top-shelf of the bedroom closet
I don’t touch it, it just cuddles with my conscience
I’m on constant guard, jittery the whole night
Clinging to sheets because it sings to me slow-like
And that’s her song running through an hourglass
Built with two wine bottles that I found in a flower patch
Planted in quicksand, refusing to sink fast
Abusing me slow, I hear the music and I think back
Before the fall, before the set up
Before the interest in sex even developed
I fell in love with distance, it's an ex’s best friend
There used to be revenge, but I couldn’t see no end
So I had to switch the lens and then focus on some flesh
No more clinging to old threads",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-grace-lyrics
Make ’Em Purr,Copper Gone,2014.0,"I was a lot more comfortable being vulnerable and open
When I was younger and it wasn’t clear if I was or wasn’t joking
But so much has broken, I'm just like ""fuck it, the fix is in.""
If I can’t hide in plain sight anymore I’ll just stay hidden
It’s been a minute since I left this domicile
No need to change my outfit, I rock it like it’s going out of style
It’s out of style? Ain’t no one here to tell me otherwise
It gets more difficult to stay inside during the summertime
But most of the time it’s just like any other time
Avoid personal interaction and human touch, shut the blinds
It’s been a while since I left this bachelor pad
I need to go to the market soon cause the food is going bad
The food is bad. I found it’s difficult to just cook for one
With healthy recipes, well, depending on what book they’re from
If you want to eat healthy you gotta dirty some dishes
The frozen dinners quickly ready to serve and it’s so delicious
It’s not delicious, it’s disgusting, but it satiates the hunger with a quickness
And hey, at least it’s something, at least it’s something
At most it’s nothing, fuck’s wrong with me? I don’t know, I’m just adjusting
It’s been a month since I left this cabin
The doctor was worried about a fever and other difficulties I’ve been having
She called me on Christmas, that was my gift
She was worried I might die, I said “I might die? No shit”

It’s been forever since I said something that I can’t wiggle free from
If there’s anything I cherish in this self-inflicted prison, it’s freedom
Comes at a cost so I’m private to a fault til I default
On the loan for home, it’s actually more like a vault
No one knows the combo but little old me
The head honcho, the holder of the key
Alone, but never lonely
It’s been a millennia since I left this dominion
Been in the company of any women
At least I got my kittens
Spent more cash on my cat than I did myself
When he stopped eating, I took him to the vet so they could check his health
They put a feeding tube into his neck
I said “Please let this work cause if it doesn't I got nothing left”
I didn’t say that, but they saw that. Cat had my tongue
I didn’t speak at all, they told me to call back
What, it wasn't weird I did nothing but stand right there?
With a ""fix this, money’s no object"" type stare
It’s been a year since I stepped into anyone else’s private quarters
I’ve been busy self-diagnosing disorders
First world problems, yeah, USA, number one
Top of the world, I’m in a tux and cummerbund
Welcome everyone to the party of the century
It’s sure to be one for the books, no doubt, medical ones especially

My 20’s were a roar, my 30’s were a blur
My 40’s, I’m not so sure, but I’mma make ‘em purr
My 20’s were a roar, my 30’s were a blur
My 40’s, I’m not so sure, but I’mma make ‘em purr
My 20’s were a roar, my 30’s were a blur
My 40’s I’m not so sure, but I’mma make ‘em purr

Escape Artist,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"When I first got into magic, yeah
When I first got into magic it was an underground phenomenon
Now everybody's like, ""Pick a card, any card""
If I shot my full load with the first hand I played
I'd be a monkey in a box
Hangin' with the David Blaines
I'd be swimming with the sharks
Mouths full of razorblades
But I'm not
I got outta that game
Escape artist
I talked till I'm red in my face
With strained polyps
I rock till I'm outta my range
Then raise octaves
I play through the pain
And remain conscious
Refraining from commenting on the lame compliments
And the petty criticisms from those who ain't accomplished
Even one-fifths of some of the shit
I've made progress with
I'm leavin' naysayers stumped like rain forests
After years of pullin' rabbit ears out my pants pockets
I'm not revealing any tricks of the trade
It's just there ain't no magic in the breakdown, baby

In an effort to make ‘em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look
None of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I’m sitting in the middle of an unread book
Letters are falling apart but the sentences stand on their own and the wording is permanent
Never been missed, I've just been misworded and misinterpreted, it’s
Funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
Results in the death sentences filling my writing assignment
I'm just wondering where my time went
It pulled a disappearing act
And every single assistant I ever had got sawed in half

Cause see I never paid attention but I can't afford to laugh (word?)
Cause I'm lookin' through my break
And an autograph for my cast (Ok)
And I'm short on staff
So all I ask is volunteers from the crowd
Show a little bit of audience participation now!
When I say ""hip"" (What do I say?)
You? You say, ""Shut the fuck up; we ain't sayin' shit!""
And I respect it (yes!)
Check it
In a flair for the dramatic exit
A fashionable entrance late to my own arraignment
(Oh) The self-destructive things that I do for entertainment
My folks gave me this heart you broke and heart is my pallet
While I was out honin' my craft
You were disownin' your talent
That's why you still live at home
And I bought this house off my parents (uhh)
I'm gettin' ahead of myself (I'm gettin' ahead of myself)
I see the hair on my back (I see the hair on my back)
I'm on the road reading Kerouac
His poems versus better raps
I think to myself (I think to myself)
What's worth remembering
Versus defending
The size of my manhood
Or confessional canned goods

In an effort to make ‘em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look
None of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I’m sitting in the middle of an unread book
Letters are falling apart but the sentences stand on their own and the wording is permanent
Never been missed, I’ve just been misworded and misinterpreted, it’s…
Funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
Results in the death sentences filling my writing assignment
But none of this is gettin' told in confidence I reckon
I spin confidential records just to hold the listeners attention

I'm a veteran of spacial relationships
I clip your wings to fit you in
Headshrinking magician
Shapeshifting reptilian
Turned body contortionist
Orphanages started offering torches to abortion clinics (abortion clinics)
I lost acquaintances
And a morgue of lady friends
I gender bent the heaven sent angelic devil boy
Good Gods androgynous
I'm lookin' marvelous
But looks can kill
And they're unsure about my sexual orientation still
Put me in a special kind of case that only breaks if
You hit it with a bouquet of flowers and baby breath arrangements
The vault is vacant
And they're all looking for fault for blame
I called my agent
The moment that I caught the train
I let him know that I'm goin' nowhere
He's invited
If he leaves tonight then he might just help me find it
But this is my burden to bear
Not his
And I'm a psychic without a sidekick
Holding the future hostage
A loose cannon standing on the rooftop with
A new respect and understanding of bartenders and locksmiths
They call me daredevil
But I'm not precise enough
Unprofessional
On an amateur level
I love my life too much
Escape Artist (x4)
(Escape, escape)
Escape Artist
I'm in two places at once
Escape Artist
But I ain't slept in months
Escape Artist
Just tryin' to get away

You're scared to shoot me in the heart
You know it's too big!

Vonnegut Busy,Copper Gone,2014.0,"Of all the words of mice and men
The saddest are, ''it might have been''
Of all the words of mice and men
The saddest are

I like for my shoes to look like they've been walked in
My house to look like it's been lived in
My car to look like a coffin that's been driven off a cliff
My career like a non-stop graveyard shift

Don't clean the crime scene cause time means money
Don't need visine when my eyes seem bloody
I see dead people, but who doesn't?
We walk undercover, deadpan, blending in with other human puppets
Discussing nothing but the sports and weather
If I stare long enough they all morph together
Then I freak out, it'll blow my cover
So I just keep out, no, we don't know each other
I'm on the road to recovery, no GPS
Hoisting my sails ‘till the sea breeze rests
Suck wind if you wanna player hate
Day to day I use my fear of falling asleep to stay awake
I appear psychic-like, but I'm not a psychic
You're just predictable with no fight left to fight it
If you write it they will come
 
with a red pen and a taser-gun
Do something


I sift through the ashes in search of surviviors
Digging up the Earth filling urns with dirt
For what it's worth I'm richer than the cemetery soil
I use slant drilling to get my midnight oil
I've been moonlighting as a daydreamer
I'm at the wheel of an eight-seater, (hey) 
hey mister gatekeeper
Call me key master
, no, home owner
One, two and to the three and to the foreclosure
They said the war was over, but we know it wasn't
They wanted more soldiers so we said ''sure, fuck it''
Here's a fresh batch of people with setbacks
The poor folk, in fact they’re all broke cause of your debt traps
Picking the pockets of people who probably needed assistance most
Selling them lies, selling them out, sending them off to a distant coast
Telling them anything anyone left with impossible debt is receptive to
Breaking a promise of negative worth like ''buddy there's nothing left for you''
Gotta buy buy buy to stay alive, they punish the payment delays
Then they charge you for the low balance then they ask ''why didn't you save?''
Too long we took it on the chin, too long we took it to our grave
Now we take what we can get, fuck an unlivable minimum wage
Do something

It might have been
(Do something)
It might have been
Of all the words of mice and men
The saddest are Vonnegut busy
Do it, do it - mess up my mind (Vonnegut busy)
Do it, do it - mess up my mind

Sometimes I shoot myself in the foot, I put my foot in my mouth
Clean it while it’s there, and then I suck the bullet out
Reload the weapon, now that's conservation
Stay locked and loaded in a bad conversation
He making blank statements like the surplus of your ammunition's finite
Visionary nothing, you're a man who lives with hindsight
Return to the hive mind and call me back
I’m predicting early that you’ll be the Monday morning quarterback
So cocksure in a culture that gangs up on bully-types
Mob mentality, as if that isn't what a bully's like
Inspiration strikes like an union
I write these lines just to cross 'em, I'm concluding
If my mama don't wanna she never has to work again
Don't ever ask me why I spread myself so thin
I'm finna flirt dirty with the pen and flick my tongue on its bottom
I promise writer's block ain't never been a problem
I'll probably make the columns wanna pop bottles of pain relief
Sometimes it's what you don't say that says the most to say the least
Idle feet are the Devil’s fetish club
A highly exclusive spot none of us are members of
Dante is a scrub - we kicked him out the van and steamrolled him
In 2010 we had a couple dreams stolen
Me and B. Dolan relocked and reloaded
When it feels like you're going through hell, keep going
And as they say may the bridges that we burn light the way


Do it, do it - mess up my mind
Do it, do it - mess up my mind

Dead Man’s Float,Copper Gone,2014.0,"Go away, be extinct, disappear, float on
Go away, be extinct, disappear, float on
Go away, be extinct, disappear, float on
Go away, be extinct, disappear, float on

Yea as we walk through the valley of the shadow of death
We shall fear no evil
For we are the most evil motherfuckers in whatever valley we choose to occupy
Gentrify, overtake or drunkenly speed through
And it's we, the hitchhikers with tired thumbs
Often greeted by middle fingers, imagery lingered as the tires spun (it's tiresome)
Now conserve your energy and lay face-down in the waterways
Seek guidance from the sirens calling out to you from those watery graves
Bodies are on display, bloated and holding their crown jewels
Instead of flotation devices, they decided the house rules didn't apply to them
Got baptised in the name of Neptune and then died for him
When the ice was thin, dead man's float for those who don't like to swim
Don't fret cause help is on its way, it'll be here any day
Just stay still and do nothing buddy, remain faithful, you're gonna be saved
And when you meet your maker you can explain
How there was a cemetery of support behind every wager that you placed
All the chorus of every deceased beast that came before is sweetly saying
""We all float down here and wait for riptide to sweep us away""
To the valley of the shadow where we shall fear no evil
For we are so cerebral, we, the ghost people
With the poke of a needle, pop of a pill, we, the post-survivalists
Holding onto the steeple like a lightning rod to show that we'd die for this
It's been said ""faith could move a mountain""
Faith couldn't even move low-income families away from Biblical floods when they were all drowning
There's not a doubt in my mind and there's not a cloud in the sky
There’s just contaminated rivers filled with waterlogged subordinates floating on by
Float on
Swimming through iron limbs of the knighted stiffs
The skeletal remains of false praise, the slow decay of yesterday's recycled gifts
They're drowning in sorrow 'cause they pray with clenched fists
Shamed by the broken promise of tomorrow, the guilt sticks to the ribs
And it's ageless, and it's ancient, and it ain't shit
When compared to the present, so all hail the king
While the paupers and peasants return to the so-called essence
The war, the famine, the death, the pestilence
Float on

Float on, float on
Float on, float on

As I proceed to finger the prints
The worst of luck ain't always bestowed upon the old and weak
We stick em, hahaha, stick em where the ocean's deep
Go to sleep young one, have sweet dreams of someone
That you'll never meet, but you'll speak of often whenever you talk in tongues
The coffin comes in the form of a canoe, no paddle
No info, no manual, live slow,
 
don't be so quick to storm the castle
Pack survival kits, 
put an oxygen mask inside the tackle box
Your limbs and abdomen will sense when the pressure of the cabin drops
Shut up when the captain talks,
 
the secret of the enlightened
Is to preach against whatever it is they practice in the dark
We're all born free, we die by the shackles we adopt
Enjoy your buoyancy, right up until the very last drop
The dead man's float, the deadpan joke
The cold touch of a stranger, the left hand stroke
There's no right hand man, the bedpans spill, the dead man's still
Face-down in his own waste, while we chase
A shadow in the gallows of the valley of death
Where we shall fear no evil for as long as we can hold our breath

Crackpipes,Personal Journals,2002.0,"Too often people said I wouldn't last
Don't make me laugh, don't make me laugh

I'd give a twenty one gunshot salute
With a toy rifle you bought me but it won't shoot
And all is well because there's been one too many shots
The sterile robots want to talk to me about Detox
Stop the presses, there's been an update
Delivered via 1:30 AM phone call
When an only half-informative source talks discretely
Meet me-- at the family room at the side of the Intensive Care Unit
Immediately, I'll carry a tune
The sirens so loud, can't hear my music
Keep free-- of negative thoughts, everything'll be fine
We all assume... That it would go back to the way things were
That it would go back to normal soon
Saw the moon in a way that I never seen it before
When I looked up that night into the sky wondering why
Lookin' for answers, guess I ain't ask right
I'm guessin most of yall out there know exactly what that's like
What that's like, now tell me 
what's that like?
It's like a whirlwind of emotions occurs when moms and dads fight
It's like when a girl grins, an emotion of hers
That holds your arm, and grabs tight
Hurl him into the ocean, one of them cold sweat heat flash types
With extreme fluctuations and temperature changes
Have been known to
 
crack pipes...
...crack pipes...crack pipes...
Meet me-- half way and I'll go that extra length just to help your strength
Meet me-- 
at the AA meeting, needing to take more then 12 steps
Bring me to your hiding place, so I can face your vice grip
I'll chisel every single monkey off your back with this ice pick
Come meet up with me on the sidelines when the game is over
Just to say hello, then afterwards, backstage
To let me know that you enjoyed the show
And go to grandma's house for Sunday dinner
Sit at the head of table take away the fatal flaw
You made the day before, I seen you bleed
Meet me-- on Christmas Eve, we can fight but make up before you leave
Make visits with the rest of those that rest in pieces on my dreams
Meet me at the fork in the road where the lost souls get indecisive
Meet me at the crossroads so I can have someone to walk into the light with",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-crackpipes-lyrics
Inherited Scars,Personal Journals,2002.0,"""I wanna show you something"" She said
As if I had built up enough trust in her
To the point where she could show me
The type of thing that she had to first
Introduce by saying she wanted to show it
Instead of just showing it like, ""Look""
And I'm like ""I don't feel like lookin'""
Like the uninterested type
So I say ""A'ight, show that shit.""
But a little more respect and reservation
It was my sister for Christ's sake
So I'm waiting for a follow-up line
There usually always is to statements like ""I want to show you something.""
It kind of runs in the same vein as statements like ""You can't tell anyone""
And then promises are made;
Secrets are kept

I didn't tell anyone about what I seen or heard that day, mums the word still
I'm scared to plant ideas into your head while your rebellious side is fertile
Hurdles are getting knocked down
I'm running a losing race
Your legs aren't the only ones marked up, how many dreams have you chased?
If I could have said this to your face maybe you wouldn't have to write like I do
Except I use paper instead of my body now; it's something you might want to try too
From haikus to horror stories, 
it's something in our blood that we share
Something in our blood that appears on the surface of our skin when we bring it there
My facial expression said I didn't care
Hate and aggression must've made an impression on the little kid who stared
Sitting on stairs when I would bother to bring my skates
My feeble attempt at being a strong, big brother doing father figure 8's
Ripping my cape on the ground that it dragged on
Tripping on fate and hearing the sounds of a sad song
Listen, it's great sharing time now that dad's gone
But what's with the choice of words?
Or the body parts that you decided to tag them on?
I'm a vagabond who moved to modern day Babylon and then back again
With minimal contact and you know I can't ask your mom what's happening
You've got such beautiful gifts, what are you doing ruining the packaging?
How ironic come to think I probably put this ink on my back for him
I want you to laugh and sing more
But you dropped anchor in a place
Where dreams go to die and you're keeping your ass indoors
I'm asking for you to stick it out and see things through
You're asking for me to zip my mouth and keep it just between me and you

If I could have been there from the beginning if I could be there right now
If I could promise to be there when you need me, would it raise an eyebrow?
How would your body be different if I still dropped by for visits?
Is it my place to put a smile on your face?
Could I erase your 
body language
 telling you its all been said before?
Or change the words you wrote, exchanging your scars for my metaphors?
I'd add them to my collection while smiling
Next time you want to paint with razor blades and need a canvas use my skin

You're hiding your sins well, but I see the hell that your limbs speak
Tongue in cheek Lying awake in bed while other kids sleep
The strength of evil begins to keep your grins weak
No matter the length of the needle
Marking up one's body is so much more than skin deep
Feel the pin prick The grim reap what they sew and you're trained to say that you're fine
Your thresh hold for pain is greater than mine
So I'm waiting in the lines that you give me patiently
While you get cut in the lines that THEY make YOU wait in, in ways that they can't see
If there's a vacancy as far as room in your life goes
Say it to me Don't do it with a knife under your clothes
Because the anguish of hidden skin is letting my ghosts be shown
Plus the language its written in hits especially close to home
I'm most alone when I'm out of touch with the people who feel this type of pain
You might just aim for a day that its raining to 
strike a vein to take my name in
Changing your uniform and altering your mind set
Has your pointer finger decided if it was a fault of his or mine yet?I
 bet
I know the dialect It's nowhere I haven't been before
With skin that's sore Battle scars that rise from our inner war
Are decorative medals of honor that our father decided to pass through inheritance
And it is repetitive when the kids head in the direction of evidence
Proving the pain and hurt is relative
All this pain and hurt is relative
(repeat chorus)

(Young Sage Francis?) Stop that, or I'll cut your head off
(Francis's little sister?) Awwwwww!

(Francis's little sister?) What!?",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-inherited-scars-lyrics
Climb Trees,Personal Journals,2002.0,"Sun set and sun rise I'm my own personal light show
Flipping switches...moving from basin bottoms to plateaus
The Earth...manipulates itself beneath me
I stand still...stagnate. Can't kill...this lagged state
Life...manipulates itself around me, but I'm dead still
Upright...but dead still
Word is still born...I will not stoop to the level of the stoop that y'all chill on
If the building's boarded up and the children of the corn
-er Liquor Store don't want to kick it no more...
Because holes have filled the wall, sneakers are scuffed & toes have become sore
I saw y'all walk from the hood of tough luck
Yeah, if these walls could talk they wouldn't shut the fuck up
Jump in your pick up truck. Drive from the mountain range
Cash the chips in on your shoulder, cut your losses, die young, count the change
How strange...you think these clouds look lovely?
Smoke signals...manipulate themselves above me
No symbols...are below me enough to overlook
I know you read my every move, I wrote the book
Mind not the blemishes that are on my premise. Endlessness is my ""to be continued...""
Notice the nervousness in my footnotes when being interviewed
Shaking uncontrollably. ""How you doing?"" ""Not bad...how about you?""
Brought it right back to me like ""What've you been up to?""
I don't talk to freaks. I even ignore my neighbors who live down the stairs
I walk the streets. And they don't know that I'm famous in 2000 years
So I say shit loud in their ears and I spit a wretched verse in their face...
Disrespecting their personal space
In a split second, curtains and drapes get closed
They think they've shut me out, but I can see their ugly mouth in the shape of ""O""s
I'd break their windows with a stone that has a note attatched
That says ""I hate Jim Crow, and here's a poem to let you know the haps:""
""I've got a golden axe and I chop cherry trees down
Dead to this world. Bury me now.""
I am from a distant place that sits and waits for my belated time to come
But its too late I've missed my fate. I ""F"" with the deaf, blind and dumb
My father taught me one thing...how to fire a gun
I don't bother...this is survival for fun
I have become the most sinister sin city clicker
Cynical dim witted trixter
Critical shit grinning hipster
Whisper...to my earhole...tell me not to be fearful
Be careful
Not to make any...sudden...movements
Show me your sole...I like to study shoe prints
You've stepped to me before! I can recognize them stubby toes!
I left them guys with bloody clothes. For a second time...nobody knows
The pain I've seen. Nobody knows the pain I've seen
Nobody knows why I've got a bloody nose or how they made it bleed
Chorus:
Climb trees...go out on a limb
To find me...forget about him
Forget about hymns...what are those psalms that you sing
What are those songs that are in your head echoing...
I am not here to make a change. I break chains
I break dance moves and move Strange--
Strange Famous is infamous for inflammatory mission statements
Living in basements with subterranean secret service agents
With little patience. A pediatrician who hate kids
Women's lib is getting choked to death by their own baby bibs
Baby, did you know I love women who hate mankind?
I talk about it all the damn time....keep it comin' HUH!!!
""IIIIIIIII HHHHAAAAAAAATE MEEEEEEEENNNNN""
This conversation is mine. I own all the stock in boring small talk
And I've trade marked this facial expression called the ""gawk.""
So fuck off. I dis functions souped by ninjas and hockey fights
While discussion groups infringe upon my copyrights
All them bitches want me tonight...I've been so great and respectful
They only get salty when I bend them into the shape of a pretzel
I make them flexible when I break their schedule. It only got hard...
When I asked 'em politely not to fight me and to give up...God
Damn...this is easier than I thought it would be
They'll attend any party and not fight it as long as they're invited cordially
Unfortunately, I've only got so many hundred openings
But talk to me, I want to take you all under my broken wings

Put up your hands y'all because I'm not tall enough to stand up to God
Who's the right woman?! Throw up one hand...and wave it now",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-climb-trees-lyrics
Gunz Yo,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"I'm on fire, I'm on fire
Me too, Me too
Gunz yo
I keep one in my pillowcase
It keeps me safe when I sleep
Still I keep awake
What if my dream girl pays a midnight visit?
I see the world through the scope but I gain no insight with it
When I get introspective I put the safety on
Make these songs with the biscuit sittin' in my shaky palms
I'm a man now (a real man)
Not the one who went to two colleges groveling over meal plans (nah)
I'm staring at the ceiling fan all wide-eyed
Amazed by the ways the blades break the silence
I used to be afraid of firin'
The sound was startlin'
But now I'm startin' to hate the quiet moments
Might remind you of a mic by the way I hold it
To the grill
A homophobic rapper
Unaware of the graphic nature of phallic symbols
Tragically ironic (suckin' off each others gats and pistols)
I got more back issues than 
Guns & Ammo
Cuz my uzi weighs a ton
And I never let go of the handle
Hangin' on to mommy's pantleg
Double-fisted
Knee-deep in shells, kickin ballistics
This dick! is a detachable penis
An extension of my manhood, position like a fetus
An intravenous hookup feeds bullets to my magazine
Never mind the bullets
My pistol is a sex machine

I keep it in my briefcase

Cubicle gangster who's in need of his personal space
Angster of love who's unable to look girls in their face
Cause I know that only stupid people increase the birthrate
I'm just about dumb enough to hold up a sperm bank
Make my demands and then facilitate fur trades
Empty the bird cage and release the mermaids
I got a water gun (what)
I keep it in my mouth
It keeps me safe from the things I like to speak about
But words are leakin' out
And all these smiles that I crack
Are like a dam on the verge of collapse
There ain't no turnin' back
In fact
I can't hold down my fluids
Can't retract statements
Without water displacement
Flooded the basement
Then sought refuge
Removed my waterproof vest then I kicked off my wet shoes
Made it to dry land, pistol in hand
Fistfuls of ammo riding on a camel in the desert sand
Lucid dreams are a lot like computer screens
People have pretentious conversations but I shoot the breeze
Blow a hole straight through their long-winded theories
Hold my own and make songs for them sing with me
It's the same type of heat that Millie used
To break the ice with Santa Claus
When she made him sing the christmas blues
Capitalists strung her up for killin' him
Every manufactured holiday they sacrifice another victim
Before wartime depression sets in
I get to steppin'
And shoeshine my weapon
I'm Hemmorhoid! I'm the leader!
You're dead like De La

Blue,Sick to D(eat)h,2013.0,"He was a southpaw but had a killer right swing
An outlaw inside of the ring
Every now and then he'd be put against the ropes but then he'd bounce back
Catch a second wind and throw blows 'til noses crack
He smashed mouths, he saw red and blacked out
Received a couple pats on the back for the smack downs
Negative reinforcement, never did he endorse it
Had the business sense to wait for press conferences to talk shit
He wasn't a dullard, though he'd never say much
Properly mothered but his father taught him how to take a punch
It was bare knuckle touch of tough love
When he got drunk enough he took his kid down to the gym and fit him up with gloves
Tied together with a shoelace, took em apart put em on
Looked in the mirror, practiced his screw face
Said, ""This is for you, Pops, for all the things we never got to do""
The hottest part of a flame is blue

The hottest part of a flame is blue
 

Now we got children thinking that they're born to fistfight
Cause they've been promised an apocalypse, by prophets without insight
He coulda fooled us, in fact we're dumbstruck
The school bus is looking like a dump truck
Stuffed in class like a landfill until it overflows
Babysitters can't get the students off their mobile phones
A junkyard dog is eating trash in the cafeteria
Feeling mad at America
The school counselor likes to recycle psychobabble
The assistant to the teacher is just an old TV
Now they've all got the urge to battle
Cause they see a sign that says, ""Like to travel? R.O.T.C.""
I don't think he can handle, he goes from flannel to camo
Cold putting all the ammo in his gun
He watched channel one, switched to channel two
Unplug completely, the hottest part of a flame is blue


We're acting like an enemy is the sea, sky, and land now
Came across soldiers who did nothing but yell, ""stand down""
In their spare time inside a shower stall
If not that, they're at the corner store playing PowerBall
And when the towers fall, they get protective of this land
And won't stand for anything to get resurrected
They're waiting for the second coming, the Great Pumpkin
Deep down, they know they really wanna do is break something
That's what they're trained to do
And then they say to you
""Just cause you see the devil in my eyes don't make it true""
And I say, ""true enough""

But the flame ain't blue enough",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-blue-lyrics
ID Thieves,Copper Gone,2014,"While taking deep, slow breaths I try to grow wings
Decided to stay low, the halo was a smoke ring
Fell around my neck, I started choking
My soul got stuck looking for openings
I thought ghosts weren’t supposed to sing like cage birds
If you’re a free broken spirit let the pearly gates burn, baby, burn
The muted trumpets in my chest take turns
When I release the spit valves gag on Gabe’s germs
Some of this is fiction written all across it
But this bathroom lit and I’m too busy spitting in a faucet
Shitting blood thinking of the quickest drug to heal me
But I’m not lovesick, your sick idea of love would kill me
Time to pry open the truth
Apply pliers to my own broken tooth
DIY or die, no health care benefits
You could spare me the ‘'I know, I’ve been there’‘ sentiments
I sense a sentimental song coming along, run along
Before I ask you to dance and all you get is trampled on
I palm faces. Mainly my own though
I’ve lost patience. I’m painting over old photos
I’m new now. Fresh out the box, all bloody
Somebody cut me loose, slap me, call me ugly
Say it how you see it, buddy. I’m a hurting hot mess
A constantly inconsistent work in progress
Fat girl in a prom dress, do more, talk less
They wanna assassinate your character content
When pressed like ab-workouts, super thin
The whitest looking Jew screaming ’‘Jerusalem’'

(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They are the identity thieves
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They speak war and pretend that it’s peace
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They are killers by association
(Got my ID ready)
Who are they?
They’ll hurt your credits with misappropriation

You can’t just get comfy and stand in one spot
Like a king of the mountain whose been planted on top
Surveying the land of your family plot
‘Til it’s all been abandoned, you're the man 'til you’re not
It happens like that when you rest on your laurels
Like a shot to your back, it’ll mess with your morals
As a matter of fact I’ve consulted with oracles
Precaution of a shaman who was dressed so informal
I’m a poor man with cash making points with no fingers
Bringing popular back 'til the smell of sex lingers
Hard bodies will stack more neatly and tidy
But I swallowed her visions, now she sees inside me
She-devil so shiesty, deceptive and sexy
Walk with me, I’ll give your legs epilepsy
My game is so shaky, if you love pain but hate me
That’s a paradox I’m unable to explain, babyyyy
Conspiracy exposed, it’s the way in which we fold the bills
Trying to overdose, instead you just choke on your pills
That’s overkill. If you’re just going for thrills
Seek a mountain you can punch 'til it explodes into molehills
I’ve done this yodel ever since I was a child
I’ve got this other yodel I ain’t done in a while
It goes pure Himalayan intelligence
Braving the elements from a man cave and haven’t shaved ever since
Never forget, you were the sperm that made it
Plus the unexpected pregnancy could have been terminated
So thanks to chance, some romance, and dancing
We’re here to our own damn thing. But damn, kid
Why'd you think I let you get away with doing radio-friendly versions of what I do?
Like I wouldn’t chide you, out perform, out write, and out rhyme you
Outsmart, out heart, and out grind you
Out shine you with the torch that was given to me
Torches are not passed to the bastards of the little league
If rap was a game you’d be M.V.P

Broken Wings,Personal Journals,2002.0,"(Chorus)
She's a fairy with broken wings
I used to watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground we walk
She glides but just seems like she floats
And these folks decide to crush her wings until they're permanently broke
She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke
She cries but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope
On the eastside hustling, discussing things that we quote
In shallow conversation as if we have deep throats
We chokin' on confusion
Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats
Trading in our cheap jokes for her c notes
I see notes being passed
I ask to see what these creeps wrote
Define silly kids and flying privileges revoked
Ski slopes have been blocked off they can't transit
Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely can't skip
Town, shes held down by the transcripts my hands grip
Tried to tie her wings back on before they're once again clipped
Panic stricken, she'll remain stuck
On a Titantic sinkin', shes trying to stay up
Change her plan thinkin' it's OK
See this is strange but
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up
I'd like to see
Her take flight into the stars
Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars
Instead of letting fly free they keep 'em in jars
I put my hand to the glass so hard
It might break the prison bars
It isn't hard to see why they keep her captive
She's naturally attractive
Speaks with adlibs, shes uncommonly talented
Ain't enough adjectives to do her disposition justice
Kids are wishin' for just a kiss and it's a mission to touch her lipstick
Can't trust her with
Freedom of movement that's a chance to loose her quick
If she ups and splits
We might as well call that discussion quits
If we's to keep her down the government's underlings
Enslave people in this town especially if their culture's rich
Exploiting talents making it do a bunch of tricks
With the rest of the wingless imports
Repeatedly told you ain't a fairy just a bitch
Just a bitch, with a butt that's thick
So rub your tits, and thrust your hips
And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit
(Chorus)
Shes a fairy with broken wings
I used to go watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground
(Verse Two)
When I was down in New York she'd send me letters
And I read her passages about how I left her to the savages
No matter how sad it is I didn't cry
Cause it was only a matter of time
Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride
I knew the scoop
Wish you could've seen the blueprints in my eye
When I flew the coop
Utilizing overground railroads in the sky
It was live or die let me let you in on the secret of mine
Me and you are different girl
We don't even need wings to fly
We don't need wings to fly
Me and you... we don't need wings to fly
Keep on singing, give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing, give it a try, give it a try (5x)",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-broken-wings-lyrics
Pressure Cooker,Copper Gone,2014,"(Where have you been?)
(Where have you been?)
(Where have you been!?)

I've been busy, get-get-get off my nuts
I've been busy, busy, doing stuff
Copper Gone, I had to take my time
To get my life together, put everything in line
Sage Francis, no need for me to tell 'em
I’m from the Epic Beard Men, I'm steady representing'
Strange Famous
And slow and steady wins the race, fuckface

This is a letter to the editor sent in an envelope
Sealed shut by some candle wax
Shipped by an olden only show pony, with a carry sack
The only thing that I overnight express is myself through song
But it takes too long to reach the intended listener
When it gets delivered wrong
Never knew the words to the school bus sing along so I stayed off
While I organized my chaos I was like ""Biotch, bring it on""
Pick ‘em up, your stupid self-esteem is low
Put ‘em down if they’re just feeling incredible about themselves
For no good god damn reason though
Never saw the need to boast
They were standing on the shoulders of a giant, so defiant
But his feet are so, Jesus, Mary, Joe
Barely even know if it appears as if I hate your guts
It’s just, both sides of my bed are the wrong one, and I’m always waking up
Plus, I don’t care to defend sides of myself that I don’t like much
I am what I am that’s all that I am, bullshit don’t got that right touch
Let the better half I punch, and push, and scratch it’s way out
Get on all fours put a saddle on your back and let the pain mount
I’m off to the races, gentlemen place your bets
Running in circles, turning their heads, eventually you could break their necks
The bookie collects, don’t play the victim when it happens
Lower the stakes before you try to burn the witches at ‘em
It’s the business of a Madam when the brothel has a profit loss
The best of the best survive the cut and the rest get auctioned off
They serve the Molotov, so Mazel Tov
Forefathers of stability in this industry  have ridiculously fallen off
Chalk it up to blackboard, fingernail, crescendos
That was my jam when I was ten, but I was deaf though
I didn’t understand that I wasn’t landing a deal at all, it was a death blow
Whistling Dixie through a hell hole then I went pro
Active-Retro even though I paid my dues
Losers hate playing a game that they can’t win so they always change the rules
And I  keep up, putting coffee into my tea cup
Try to cut me down when I take a stand? Good luck
‘Cause I got legs like a tree trunk

They say anger is a gift, I’m very gifted
And if ignorance is bliss then I’m a Sado-Masochist
Mastered the passion for the sake of stripping it from all its pleasure
Got a treasure chest collapsing under pressure

Get-get-get off my nuts
I've been busy, busy, doing stuff, Copper Gone
I had to take a minute to get my shit together
Otherwise I was finished, Sage Francis
No need for me to tell 'em, I tried to keep from yellin’
But I'm steady representin' Strange Famous
And slow and steady wins the race, fuckace

I been treating a vacant lot as if it’s a destination spot
Picked a hell of a depression to set up my shop
Master of tragic-comic timing
Mellow drama you understood, a sensei to some
Hyperventilating praying for the end of days to come
By selling survival kits, New Testament bibles to Zionists
And training wheels to professional cyclists, it’s like this
Plucking petals from your frame, She-Loves-Me-Not and goes nowhere
I pump my tires while you pump my brakes, I thought it was no fair
Spent several sessions giving away precious possessions
During an endless recession, turned repentance to oppression
Pressure into a permanent first impression
I’m the last of my kind so I side-step your health inspection
There’s a difference between gambling addiction and making love to Lady Luck
Erectile Dysfunction and being afraid to fuck
The pressure’s always building, I simply can’t wait to erupt
Both sides of my bed are the wrong one and I’m always waking up
(Always waking up, always waking up)

They say anger is a gift, I’m very gifted
And if ignorance is bliss then I’m a Sado-Masochist
Mastered the passion for the sake of stripping it from all its pleasure
Got a treasure chest collapsing under pressure",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-pressure-cooker-lyrics
Over Under,Copper Gone,2014.0,"You get over me
You get over me
You get over me
You, you

Babygirl I've done been over myself (out of myself)
Over the counter and under the shelf
Into the wild while hiding my welts
You think really gonna tell me to do nothing else
Hurl insults to me like that shit helps
Got a malleable muscle in my chest
Yes it breaks (it heals) it freezes (it melts)
It sees itself in the worst of light
And it curses the day that I learned to write
The guys are all “Do you even lift bro?”
Shit no I don’t, girls are like “Ewwww
He drive a Prius, he saving money, he’s hoarding cash
Who does he think he is?
What’s the point of living if you can’t ball and flash?"" (Balderdash!)
Even more than half of them broads don’t have a passport
I’m a citizen of the world, girl, I couldn’t take you there if you asked for it
Oh I know, get over myself, all you see is me holding myself
What you don’t see is an OG oak tree protecting the forest like nobody else
I popped that lumberjack dead in his beard, had to grow a bigger one by the end of the year
I let it get so long I could fuck it, after that I'll let you cut it
Shyeah, I’m over myself so much that I’m just looking down on myself
As I watch everybody try to bad talk pride
And they constantly strive to be proud of themselves
Follow the beat of another conundrum
Get out of the heat, rent a cottage in London
I’m on a retreat and I’m under the assumption
No matter where I go there I am
Middle-earth excursion, head to New Zealand
Shoot for the stars and I’m breaking the ceiling
Center of the Universe, can’t shake the feeling no matter where I go there I am

Honey I been over myself, out of myself
Extra extra large, rocking sexy socks with garter belts
You ain’t really gots to tell me nothing (you already said)
You ain’t really gots to say 
Nathan
 (god damn broken record)

Oh I know, I know I let myself go
I simply slipped through my own pathetic grip
Could never really get a firm grasp of my true inner glow
But tell me the truth, are you more pissed that I let go of you? 'Cause it was overdue
In person your life don’t look nearly as well put together as all your photos do
And that’s ok but eventually, since you pushed me, since you pressed me
Fuck your non-stop, toxic, drama carpetbagging, fuck your selfie
Oh, I’m the pig? You tried to strangle me in a blanket though
You’re a GMO seed of greed in my organic garden
Wanting my resources to make it grow (oh hell no)
It’s a courtesy call-back, let the pilot fly
I’ll be your emergency contact if you’ll be my ride or die
Gotta swallow the pride and then follow the footsteps
Out of my mind I'm not out of the woods yet
I’m trying to find a location that’s good yet
No matter where I go there I am

Over the counter and under the shelf
Into the wild while hiding wealth
You ain't really got to tell me to do nothing else
Cause I've heard it all before from a sharper tongue with a lot more scorn
Performing self flagellation with improper form until the copper’s gone

Different,Personal Journals,2002.0,"""Nothing at last is sacred.
 Oh how the great have fallen
What have I done to myself? It's been way too long!""
We need to reacquaint. Things are different now, I ain't the same man I was
Hi, how are you doing? I'm new and improved with even less to lose
A collector's edition version of a virgin drink ordering cocktail teller
Gone way wrong...to the point of no return
Over the edge and burned out before I even got my shine
Holding my head in pure doubt
Out of insight. Out of mindful things to shout or rhyme about
Yeah, I know I was supposed to change the world and all
Looks like the world got to me first
If you can't beat em, join 'em..
Then hurt the team by beating yourself
I'm different...in a different way
The only thing that stays the same is change
While people claim their states, I state my claims
Sage Francis made a name for himself
For the record my mother calls me Paul
Which was my father's middle name, but Ray
Stepped in and raised me
It's crazy, but this is a game I play
Called ""Shut the fuck uuuuuuup!""
Don't bother calling me at all because I'm not answering
Is that a voice-mail-bomb-threat or her broken promise I'm mishandling?
Gambling away my money issues, somebody owes me big bucks
My career depends on explosive vacuums sucking me in and blowing me up
Poetry struck a nerve in the listenership
Spoken word then got 'em all interested
Now I don't have to serve ice cream to little kids
I get to serve emcees who think they're rippin' it
And poets who think they're somehow significant
Meanwhile both are loud and ignorant
And don't know how to speak to a crowd in an intimate environment
I am different. In a different way
The only thing that stays the same is change
While people claim their states, I state my claims
I'm a quiet natured player who outwardly hates the game
I shake what I got, which is a jingly pocket
Do my mini-market research and make noise for myself when I walk quick
I talk with authority while I question it
When I ask, ""Who am I?"" I'm left guessing
But if you're a poor man's version of ANYTHING
It is your self-perception
Growing up in a microscopic town prepared me well for this petrii dish
Where talk is invisible to the naked eye and I hate the guy they're speaking with
I'm a real vegetarian: No chicken...not even fish
I'm a real underground rapper
My tape quality sucks, my records are warped and my CD skips
Lady Luck is a greedy bitch with itchy palms and a case of the gimmes
But I've got an outtie if she's got an inny
I'll clean her pipes and then sweep her chimney
The beat that's in me is polyrhythmic. You're only 60 heart beats per minute
A human 
second-hand-me-down-to-earth-guy
 who will 
thriftshop-lift
 his hiphop
I may be getting too big for my britches
But I paid my dues when the cost was climbing
And if I burn too many bridges I'll never get off of this awful island
As long as I've been rhyming, they only started listening
Because for a while they didn't like how
I wouldn't smoke the pot that I was pissin' in
Plus I had no dead homies to pour out the liquor I don't drink
You can flash your shiny objects in front of my eyes and I won't blink
I'm motherfucking different. Oooohhhh yyyeeeaaahhhh..
I'm motherfucking different. Oooohhhh yyyeeeaaahhhh..
Different like a platypus

Once Upon A Blood Moon,Copper Gone,2014.0,"He offered her the world, but came up short
The nastiest of storms made him settle on a city with a port
He watched ships sail by in the middle of July
He wrote notes on paper boats, sat and waited for replies
Hope floats, even when it's on fire
Especially when it's on fire, but the smoke makes him tired
Took a blade to the chest like he was opening a body bag
""Sir, he's still alive in there!"" Well Christ then, remove the tag
What's it say? It says ""Fold along the lines
And set me free, not on fire, cause often times
When I set myself free, this empty
Bag of a body tends to get burned in effigy""
I've lost the energy to fight off the flames
Or blow it off like it's all just a game, all the same
Wish he wouldn't write himself out of the picture
It's a beautiful ocean that you got
When there's someone there to share it with ya'
This is why she can't have nice things
He was too caught up in work to sign for the nice deliveries that life brings
Now he can't tell if he's dead or not
He said, ""I bet I am, and I can prove it."" She said, ""You better not""
This is why she can't have nice things
Because talk is cheap and it was poor communication

All he wanted to say, on the dock that day
Was ""I love you, and I'm sorry,"" but instead, he just waved
Good bye, and he cried, love
So much he watched the waters rise up
It must have been a changing of the tides, but I've come to assume
It was the changing of a mind, once upon a blood moon

They skimmed rocks for the whole day
He imagined he was throwin' rotten parts of himself that broke away
So he couldn't stop, fascinated by the way they skip up top
Give up and then drop (he sank with 'em)
They convened on the rock bottom and made a decision
They could never raise children, not like this
Not like people who make babies on purpose
That's when he came to the surface, fully intending
To be so strong in his resolve, 'til all of it dissolved
Slippin' through his pruny fingers like ""this could've been ours""
But this is to the offers that can't be followed through with
The water works, the leaky faucets, the lost fluids
To the current of the stream that'll always push you from me
To the reoccurring dream that makes reality less ugly
In a picturesque setting, where the world looks airbrushed
Needless to say, words failed us

On the dock that day, all I wanted to say
Was ""I love you, and I'm sorry,"" but instead, I just waved
Good bye, and I cried, love
So much I watched the waters rise up
It must have been a changing of the tides, that was breaking up our lives
It was a water-aged wrinkle in time

And, yeah sure, minds are made for the changing, but mine's been deterioratin'
Like the bluffs on the shoreline where I've been waiting to exhale
Since the summer when we watched every last one of our friends set sail
And I was the only living boy left in Providence
Collecting death certificates and the rest of my documents
Just for origami purposes, I gave 'em to the ocean
Like, ""Hey, look at me, I'm great at folding
Guess I'll just do this the rest of my life
It's got to do with lots of lovin', and it ain't nothin' nice""

This is why she can't have nice things
He was too caught up in work to sign for the nice deliveries that life brings
This is why she can't have nice things
Because talk is cheap and it was poor communication
This is why she can't have nice things
He set fire to the paper boat sonatas he's been writing
And this is why I assume the moon was bleeding
And why there wasn't any blood left in the rock he was squeezing",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-once-upon-a-blood-moon-lyrics
Little Houdini,LI(F)E,2010,"Christopher Daniel Gay was arrested on a Friday
In Florida at the Daytona International Speedway
He was a fugitive on the run, Christopher made a quick escape
While being transported in a van that was picking up convicts state to state
He did it during a bathroom break, he hot-wired somebody's pickup
In fact, Christopher had a long history of theft involving trucks
He was on route to Alabama for stealing someone's travel trailer
Grand Theft Auto he was a career criminal, jailbird who also
Had three outstanding warrants in his home state of Tennessee
It was an outstanding performance that set him free
(Little Houdini)
Stole a big rig, then a tour bus that belonged to Crystal Gayle
To evade a five state manhunt that wanted to put that birdy back in jail
But they failed

Cause Christopher wasn't just running from cops
Christopher Gay was now racing a clock
His mother was dying and there was no time to be held inside of a cage with locks
So yall can turn up your nose and suck on your teeth and wag your finger like tsk-tsk
But he had to take the risk
(Little Houdini)
There wasn't a single thing sinister in his decision to break from the prison
His only motive was to go back to his childhood home while his mom was still living
It wasn't a house, more like an old mobile camper
Where she was bedridden diagnosed with colon cancer
Sometimes the only answer we're left with
When the loved one's name is on the death list
Is to head for the exits and go home
Christopher got the hell out of Texas
His abandonment was reckless
It prolonged his sentence
Y'all can forget it
He had numerous convictions and none were as strong as this
Unless you consider the other instance he went the distance
Similar situation, it was a bizarre coincidence
When he escaped from the prison the first time
Not this time, but the one before
He visited his dad cause he was dying inside of a mental ward
Suffering from Alzheimer's
He paid respects, made his peace
When he was done, he didn't run
He returned himself back to the police
That's when his mom made her plea
She said

""He knows what he done was wrong
But he knows his father don't got long
He's not a fugitive on the run
He's not dangerous, he's our son
He ain't never hurt no one
He knows what he's done was wrong
But he knows his father don't got long
He's not a fugitive on the run
He's our son""
This ain't no country western song

Christopher wasn't just running from cops
Christopher Gay was now racing a clock
His mother was dying and there was no time to be held inside of a cage with locks
So Y'all can go on tossing rocks And talk your talk like tsk tsk
Meanwhile Chris is stealing a tractor trailer from Wal-Mart
An 18 wheeler, he's peeling rubber the bird takes flight down turnpikes
Three hundred thousand dollars worth of merchandise, but it ain't worth her life
Ran it off the road, and abandoned it
50 yards from his moms to avoid the cops
Thats half a football field from her feeble arms
After all this stuff
The tour bus, the pick up trucks
The tractor trailer, interstate chases
He put on the brakes and couldn't get close enough
The news reporters told people to lock their doors
Like there was a monster on the loose but there was no truth to those reports
His mom had weeks to live
And Chris had years to serve
They were within shouting distance
But I don't think he heard her final words
I don't think he heard her final words
She made her plea to the TV

""He knows what he's done was wrong
But he knows his mama don't got long
He's not a fugitive on the run
He's not dangerous, he's my son
He ain't never hurt no one
He knows what he's done was wrong
But he knows his mama don't got long
He's not a fugitive on the run
He's not dangerous, he's my son""
This ain't no country western song

The third time he escaped from a state cop at the Georgia pit-stop
He just slipped out of the handcuffs, he jumped ship then he took off
With no father to visit, no mom to go home to
Just a wide open sky where he could fly
With no father to visit, no mom to go home to
Just an open road where he could be free

Cheat Code,Copper Gone,2014,"(I talk a lot of shit, but I can back it all the fuck up)
I don' talk about it really, but I’m still the illest
Still the baddest
Bless the apparatus I got silverback gorilla status
I pull the one red string that runs through your mattress
And make your bed springs sing a song of sadness
Sad sack of shit, pack your things and go
I’m hopping freight trains with nothing but a bindle (no hobo)
Little homie said ‘'YOLO’‘ — no props
I photobomb your photo ops busting out the robocop
Teach me how to dougie, kid, I’d rather do the knowledge
Now go home and get your shine box, you got a couple shoes to polish
Undergrad, this ain’t no humblebrag
I’ve sonned one too many Johnny come latelies, now baby come to dad

Bump a runner up. If I’m not top billing, I’m show stealing
Sistine Chapel vandal type, tag the whole ceiling
Sick of hearing rap with no feeling
Sick of trauma porn addicts thinking they’re poets, that’s not soul bearing
Break yourself, fix your face
My heartbeat breaks the 808’s, now update your database
So many Roc Raida tapes, not enough functional dual cassette decks
Who will you sweat next?
Stupid, I maneuvered through a school full of rednecks
Some people I was cool with despite a few death threats
Sacrificed a social life, food, and some rent checks
So I can grab a mic where the hell ever I like, and catch wreck
Yeah, I got swung on from time to time
Been cornered in some clubs just for speaking my mind
Mental midgets couldn’t come up with the lyrics or rhymes
Now I’m back popping more shit than ever and I’m fine
Find me if you need me, son, I’m easy to locate
You finally gonna feed me? Then I’m eating that whole cake
Got licensing in movies and TV? That’s so great
Don’t break your coke-nail trying to throw weight, okay?
Curb stomp your enthusiasm
Don’t expect resolutions just 'cause every movie has ‘em
Don’t expect revolution from the music
That is solely created for the sake of booty clapping
Fool, keep rapping
Release the kraken, beat back the back beat
Blending instrumentals, running my mouth at the track meet
My victory lap shows no mercy in this dojo
Spinning back-kick the Willie Bobo
Sweep the head. Breaking bread with the best of 'em
Crumbs are left under the table for the rest of 'em
I don’t speak in metaphysics 'cause I’m not a metaphysicist
I’ll diss the living shit out of these so called lyricists
Fuck y'all

Excuse me for having ethics, I don’t eff with little toys
I learned to scratch on phonographs, got my ups with Kilroy
A killjoy? You're crying over spilled soy milk
I'll destroy the shit brick house that your roids built
You walk tall ‘til I kick out your stilts
You look buff 'til I call your bluff and pull up your kilt
You’ve been padding your resume
While I’ve been rhyming about life like I’m rapping my death away
Stay well composed, figuratively, literally
They prefer a hashtag to metaphor, simile
Brag-rap to poetry, backtrack to symphony
Sweet talk the sour puss, press and push bitterly
The days of getting degraded, they ain’t diminish me
Oh uh, but they prefer the skinny me?
I’m an emotional leader of the emcees who sit in sulk
Fuck being complicated, Uncle Sage is difficult
It’s a cult of personality stuck in a false reality
It’s all a bunch of mall punk and dance club rap to me
Swagger jacking, black cracker, battle rap has gone minstrel
Born on third base acting like they hit a triple
With a wiffleball bat walking pretty
Talking gritty with no app, in fact, it’s all theory
I promised your death threats don’t actually kill me
But bite my dog and I'mma scratch your kitty

It’s like that, y'all, it’s like that, y'all
It’s like that-that-that, it’s like that, y'all

Going Back To Rehab,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"I'm going there to give him cash, hear him laugh, bring him back
If I can't tear down these walls, I'll slip him through the crack
If that crack ain't big enough, I'm sick enough to get committed
Where he's been, I ain't been allowed to visit, and I miss him
They put me in a submission hold, got him living in a hole
Give me the rope, pull it back, cut him slack--he's getting old
This cold does nothing for his bones... he's shaking
Always put on hold, that prison phone's always taken
They put me on a speaker but my voice is breaking up
I'd like to think he caught bits and pieces before the gates got shut
Raise it up!
Somebody cover me, I'm going in, with razor cuts, and something ugly that I know within
Can't afford the luxury of exposing everything, but I've been doing the best that I can. (that I can)
I take it day by day, just one step at a time, and I don't need a sobriety test to walk the line
Walking on this tightrope with arms open wide, hoping to find you live and well on the other side
So I could give you this gift as a symbol
When I felt the rope loosen, I knew I missed my window
""He really did love you, you know"", pat, pat
I said ""Get your fucking hand off my back""
This is my passage into adulthood and I need not
Smalltalk fingers fishing from a weak spot
I used to dream a lot
In search of meaning in a sleepwalk
The only time I find myself having a deep talk
And now I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of debt
One can never rest depending on how up the drugs get
Upset? Submit me to a blood test
Find no trace of my words, reverting back to
""Wait, that wasn't what I meant""
My right eye is sunrise, the left is sunset, the moonshine ain't got me drunk yet
My tongue's wet for the lunar eclipse, and when you're flat broke ain't nothing you won't do for a fix
It's a beautiful mix of Jesus-Juice on my lips
And words that are stuck so I stirred 'em up with a crucifix
And this is where I found a friend in Christ
But I also found a few spikes and I decided to use them as pegs on my bike
So you'd have a place to stand when I broke you out of that vice
And now I'm going back to rehab. (going, going, back, back to rehab)
I'm going back to rehab... (going, going, back, back to rehab)
I'm going back to rehab... (going, going, back, back to rehab)
I'm going back to rehab... (going, going, back, back to rehab)
(going, going, back, back to rehab) (going, going, back, back to rehab)
I'm going back as a Dead-Again Christian, with a medicine prescription
Yeah I'm a friend of Bill! Let-let-let me in!
Get me outta this!
Hooked up to plugs and wires 
while the dogs sniff for a powdered substance
In a town of judgments with glass-house developments
Cookie-cutter Republican school-book intelligence
They ain't never considered how just one rock
Could crack the whole facade, now they confiscate slingshots
I will not meditate on the sermon
Heaven's gate is burnin'
, so we self-medicate with bourbon
While their collection plate gets turned into a purse
I've turned into a second-rate person, but I'm not the first
This isn't your typical cry for help
I tried to melt, but someone stopped the trickling with a Bible belt
Reminded me of tourniquets and heroin nods
Now that, that right there, that's one hell of a God
You can't match magic with an addict that's got a mapping compass
In order to find a substance and matchstick that functions
A searching and fearless immoral inventory
'Til every person with a story begins to bore me
I did what I had to do to get
To the place where your face wasn't such a blurry mess
I packed all your favorite promises and words that we kept
You weren't hard to find, all it took was 13 steps
And now I'm going back to rehab...
I'm going back to rehab...
I'm going back to rehab...
I'm going back to rehab... I don't drink though
I'm going there to give him cash, hear him laugh, bring him back
If I can't tear down these walls, I'll slip him through the crack
If that crack ain't big enough, I'm sick enough to get committed
Where he's been, I ain't been allowed to visit, and I miss him
Put me in a submission hold, got him living in a hole
Give me the rope, pull it back, cut him slack--he's getting old
This bitter cold does nothing for his brittle bones--he's shaking
Eternally put on hold, that prison phone's always taken
Put me on a speaker but my voice is breaking up
I'd like to think he caught bits and pieces before the gates got shut
Raise it up!
Somebody cover me, I'm going in, with razor cuts, and something ugly that I know within
Can't afford the luxury of exposing everything, but I've been doing the best that I can
I take it day by day, just one step at a time, and I don't need a sobriety test to walk the line",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-going-back-to-rehab-lyrics
Got Up This Morning,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"It's not that what we're doing is wrong
But let's try to keep this here secret
Between me, you, and the song
Ménage à trois that sings to me
Sinfully
When god plays along

What you want with a woman who won't do what you say?

I was sweet on her
She was sweet on Jesus
We slept with a blanket barrier between us
Master of her craft, I had her laughin' like hyenas
When I asked her if she'd marry an elitist
Staggering genius in lace
With the grace of a drunken monk
The mask isn't seamless cause her face says something's up
But I don't dare ask her I just listen
Switchin' to my good ear and adjusting my position
As she discuss Ginsberg I listened and learned
As she disperses his words I just resisted the urge to do like he would
Whatever he wanted, if she allowed me to
She dangled that carrot then asked me:
""What would Bukowski do?""
Oh don't go there
He'd make you his mom and then completely lie about it in a book later on

Got up this morning
Didn't know right from wrong

Spirits were lifted when she whispered something French in my ear
Tension was there
When I responded in English it sounded less sincere
The sex in the air couldn't be left alone
So welcome to the Terrordome
A bedroom full of pheromones
Where nothing that we say is set in stone
If I thought it was for posterity I'd already be writing better poems
But I'm talking in extremes
Best this and best that
Best not regret anything that ever gets said to this hell cat
Creepin' on all fours
Ready for combat
With secretive wars sneaking her claws in our contract
Bending every which way but loose with no proof that anything that we've suggested to this day is the whole truth


I heard her chemical romance was a medical slow dance
Said my advance was sexual
Held my genitals with cold hands
Set up the Coke cans
Broke out the Red Ryder
Then one by one I tried to knock down everything that's dead inside her
She used to treat street dividers like a balance beam
Arms spread wider than the legs in her dad's magazine
Re-enacting the pages that she got trapped between
I used it for kindling and then spilled the gasoline
Now I'm your water boy
I fetch it from your cheeks just like tennis balls
Smell the stench of your weakness on the bedroom walls
Somebody careless let em vaporize
""Who let these fall to the floor from your poor vacant eyes?""
Disintegrate
This ain't a great first impression
But I work better on pages, they say words are my profession
Let me spell it out in simple language
Plain English
I want your suicide to be a book of mine that I never finish

The Buzz Kill,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"You are listening to the heartbeat of the Sage
Sage posses the newest and most revolutionary advance in split-second presentation
As well as split-second calculation
To protect the future of America
The defense techniques of tomorrow had to be discovered now
But Sage needed more than this
New concepts, new tools, new weapons
By analyzing the past, Sage can project into the future

I used to think that rappers had it figured out
Brass Monkey, St. Ides, Olde English, and Guinness Stout
Once a man, twice a boy with a choice of vice, a voice of spite
Not enough poisons to pick to enjoy this life
Man, I thought suicide was a suburban myth
I couldn't see my own hands being the ones I'm murdered with
That is until I traveled this world a bit
I understand now if I lose my nerve I'll get the girl to do it!
She heard the music but preferred the person--she's worth it
The only one I let behind the curtain to work with
Pushin' buttons and playin' with levers
We'll stay together as long as I'm modest in my songs
Radio - suckers never play this
Scared shitless of dismissing Clear Channel playlists
Poorly developed, yet highly advanced
The black music intertwined with a white man's line dance

Supersonic, super destructive, seemingly unresistable
On the job around the clock, with 24-hour-a-day reliability
Constantly monitoring, pulse-taking, controlling
Into a continuous flow of interpretations, which could be understood at a glance

It's not lonely on top
I'm kept busy with shivers and cold shakes
Sitting on snowbanks
Waving to be delivered some soulmates
So I wait/weight
Lift and test my faith on several levels
Build my body till they send me an empty face with the head of devils
My breath resembles the smell of flowers
Yanked from life and placed in a vase
Sits and wilts and rots and dies in the name of grave mistakes
That we all make
Believe we're getting by treating ourselves wrong
Throw me a reindeer John letter party
And I'll be there with bells on
Hell spawned some iffy calls in City Hall
They still got the gall
To blame the vitriol on Biggie Smalls
From strip malls
To strip clubs
They slip drugs
Into the drinks that kids love
Tell us to drink up and get buzzed
This is the buzz kill, jump into the saddle
Emerge from the dust kicked up in the uphill battle
With my guns drawn and sword out
Pointed towards the courthouse
I sort out words from my war-torn mouth
I disassociate the actions with their meanings
On some ""ends justify the means"" mentality
Plus I'm bleeding
Give me a Band-Aid, a band that can't play
A fanbase with hearing aids and a voice like a hand grenade
I pull the wool over their vision
Pull the pin and push it in 'em
I'm using women as a pin cushion
A supervillain
With some warpaint and jokes done in poor taste
We'll see who laughs last, all the way to foreign banks

Ready to take over in a matter of seconds
To protect the future of America
Sage also has protection too
(Come on, come on, feel it, feel it)
The protection which comes with the possesion of weapons of retaliation
But is this protection enough?

(I was) I was B-boyin' in my former body
Singing all the songs at parties
Now I'm like, ""Don't let nobody
Through the door in the hotel lobby!""
I'd wear Armani if they endorsed me
So people who are poor can rob me
Then forcefully sex me up
Color me confused when they paint issues black and white
Resuscitate their gray matter right back to life
It's my destiny, she wants me, she beckons
She left me for dead but Death didn't want no sloppy seconds
I'm certified fresh
I freedom-kiss the French for their political dissent
Like mwah/moi
I do it with tongue this time
And take that bovine blood out your wine
And take that statue back to the lab it was created at
Your huddled masses yearning to breath free
Take 'em back!
Your homeless, tempest-tost to me
Take 'em back!
The U-S-A has cracked

And as long as we're on guard
As long as we're ready to look ahead
To move ahead
The future of America is secure",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-the-buzz-kill-lyrics
Hell of a Year,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"It's been a hell of a year, but I'm mentally prepared
To do a dance around the next couple medical scares
I'm Fred Astaire with the metal wearing quickly off my tap shoes
So I step quietly, the way that cat's move
But I'm bear-like. My head trapped in dear lights
You can call me John, I'm writing letters to the dark side of the moon tonight
My lovely Jane, you went away but the pain stayed
So I'm sending you a package to the address where we traded names
I made no claims on the identity theft
I'm more concerned about the home with no amenities left
And it's already a mess. The dust piles like your junk mail
So I eat away depression and crush the scale
You find yourself on the opposite side of the spectrum
Emaciated on a strict diet of bed crumbs
Me? I choose to wallow and swim in my fat
You...refuse to swallow so I see ribs from the back
This isn't an attack, it's an admission of guilt
I'm living in the past, kissing your ass, sipping your milk
But it's all bone and curdle. I saw stones in a circle
Stood in the middle. 
Told myself riddles in a robe that's purple
The murder weapon was an icicle
Is that the reason why I'm standing in this puddle with my eyes so full?
I fight feelings like a war on drugs
I'm a chemist with a test tube addiction born through coffee mugs
Our baby now is all growed up
Your car is still dead in my driveway while I wait for the tow truck
And you know what? I know I drove you away
I still don't think it was wrong so I don't know what to say
It's been a tough year. You say that life ain't fair
Well, guess what, baby...life ain't. Thems the breaks
You say that life ain't worth it. But it is. You gotta work it
Nobody's life is perfect
Yeah, you've been dealt a bad hand. Placed against a stacked deck
Been through all the cat scans and bad checks
But I slashed your debt. Not your wrists
And I couldn't help with anything else that became cancerous
Halfway people with a full baby to bury
Took a flame to the papier-mache sanctuary
When the smoke clears...try not to stare into the light
But, also, don't stay in the dark as if that's what life is like
It's just a series of unfortunate events
But the messages we get are more important than death
What's the rush?
I've got a shortness of breath
What's the rush?
Running from you...running from me
It's the rush. The crush. The lust. The love-trust
So what's the trouble? The busted bubble? The unjust?
That's just the way the cookie crumbles. It does suck
But suck it up. We're all looking, but nothing's enough
Use each other as a crutch to clutch the shift-switches
You couldn't just adjust. You combusted and ripped pictures
This is why I'm not considered a saint?
Well, guess what?......I ain't
It's been a hell of a year
You said that I ain't there, I ain't care, and life ain't fair
It's been a hell of a trip
You say my mind's unfit, I've been flip, and I ain't shit
It's been a hell of a life
You say that I ain't like the way I write and that ain't right
It's been a hell of an attempt
You say that I ain't meant for promises unkept
Well, guess what, darlin'
I'm a keep keep callin'
Guess what, darlin'
I'm a keep keep callin'

The answer comes in the form of a handwritten letter from the moon
It says:
""This is beautiful
So are we
This is endless
So are we
We can heal this
It's time to create our fates""

Sun vs Moon,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"The devil only exists because of your belief in him
Same goes for that other guy
I believe the sun is simply reflecting the shine from the moon (word?)
Stealing its spotlight, they'll have a cockfight at noon
To settle their differences
At midnight, rematch
To stir up their similarities on turntables
That chicken scratch proved to be unreadable
The determining factor in who gets the pitch to control the tides
No one decides a victor unless they give a fair listen to both the sides
We're low-lives
We go blind jerking off to the eclipse
The sun was pulling cheap shots doing commercial body tricks
Behind the back, Under the leg
I think he even did a headspin
On a crossfader that sounded whack, But looked excellent
All of the sudden it gets dim
The crater face steps in
Puts Mexican drumbreaks on the Technics
He's like ""Let's begin""
He conducted an orchestra so dope the sun started sweatin' him
I guess he'd expected to win on pure artistic merit
Composing complex plays with nothing but soundbytes
Burned out the lights
Made MCs too self conscious to put their mouths to mics
For a thousand nights
It continued without a single slip up
Except once the record skipped
But it kinda sounded cool
And fit within the rhythm he was juggling
Polyrhythms out of country western albums spinning
It is plain that he had come to win
But as always due to corrupt judging
They drew a tie - Now it's do or die
The sun was like
No no no
But the moon was like
Go go go
(repeat x3)
And when the sun was chosen
I came to the conclusion
His dad doesn't know what he's doin'
God's not a woman
He's a big white guy in the sky
And the deserts are reflections of his eyes
He doesn't cry for us
But when he does
It's cause he's drunk
(Say What?)
God's not a woman
He's a big white guy in the sky
And the deserts are reflections of his eyes
He doesn't cry for us
But when he does
It's cause he's drunk
And he's always fucked up
Bottoms up
God's not a woman
He's a bitch

Praise Jesus Christ
Do everything the Bible tells you to
Love thy neighbor
Do not murder anybody)

This is one hand clapping alone

Keep Moving,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"I keep moving, I keep moving
I keep moving I keep moving
I keep moving, I go from house to house
I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out
I bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place
Divorce papers falling out my briefcase
Miss intuition, the half truth harlot
Got her suspicions, lacks proof but wants it
I've been practicing grabbing the noose when the knot slips
Rewiring my mind to make the firing squad miss
And while they're busy reloading
I'm decoding the messages you sent with this key that I keep holding
But it's a copy and the lock seems broken
Got me choking on discussions I cannot keep open
I'm fully clothed in this cocktease moment
The last cigarette sits between my lips but I will not smoke it
And while it dangled I got strangled by a secondhand
Broke the rope, held my breath, and let my chest expand
Through the stogie, to the lonely hitman for hire
Told him he owed me, showed me that his hand's on fire
We didn't shake on it, he nodded, I nodded back
Lit the cigarette with his fingertip and dropped the gat
I started walkin the tracks you shoulda tied me to
Waited for the train to hop or stop to say goodbye to you
When I turned my head heard what you said
""Murder him dead, tried to do it with the girl in his bed""
So I fled, remembering one should never look back
There's no direction home only blood on the track
Stuck in the past, I jetted, I left the red footprints for them to follow
Headed for tomorrow where I take sips from a flask
You bought me for my sober anniversary
Her dad tracks my scent, she's got her old man in search of me
He knows where I'm headed, he's been there
King of the home, sits on his throne like it's an electric chair
I'm the heir to that domestic death sentence
I see people accepting lethal injections dead in seconds
They confuse prison for a bed and breakfast
Check my voicemail see you left a message
Could it be her, could it be? The desperate
Mad at me because they lack a strategy for exit
Huh, nobody pregnant, nobody get burped
I got lost on this head trip but I won't talk to an expert
My legs hurt cause I've been walking with cement boots
Ever since you lured me to the water bed to get cute
She had a wet suit and dry disposition
But couldn't execute this type of mission
It's no small time thing organizing my ending
My book of life is a choose your own adventure with a circular section
You told your friends I walked all over you
But you know that's not what these boots were made to do
In fact, you had them crafted at the store
You said, ""Baby, put them on"", I don't know what you take me for
Knew something was up when they got nailed to the floor
Since the key didn't work, I kicked my way through the door
I keep moving, I go from house to house
I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out
I bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place
Divorce papers falling out my briefcase
I keep moving, I go from house to house
I stay committed like one foot in, one foot out
I bounce (bounce), yeah I'm leaving this place
Divorce papers falling the fuck out my briefcase

And I found something here I want you to have
It's not much, just a story, but it's all I got so take it
It's called Dylan
Dylan's drug of choice was ""more""
So Dylan took more and more and more
Until the day he woke up babbleling in the pool of his own traffic jam
Realizing he is killing off the best parts of himself
And claiming he could read peoples skin
When he looked down at his heart flap, it said ""boy, go find your spine, and ride it out of here.""",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-keep-moving-lyrics
Agony in her Body,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"Day one I played with her blood
Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love
Day three her blood played with me
Dirty talk caught me off guard
Had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy
Baby you don't know where my mind has been
Fell off the bike more than twice
But it's time to ride again
This time I learned from my past falls
Old wounds may re-open soon
Burn 'em in alcohol
I heard that last call
It was a close one
Road runners
Know which direction to go when snow comes
Now we're coasting
Extra traction on radial tires
Having sex in the back wrapped in radial wires
Self abusive
Stuck in a bad place
Head full of bruises and scratched face
I've bled profusely
Stirred in my juices
So you can taste me
Put my neck in a noose
And swung to safety
Found a land mine planted in the sole of my foot
I can't find santcum in the holes of input
I keep diggin'
Covered in earth
I undress
They run tests
I leave the dirt to the experts
White coats and shiny objects
I jump their lifeboat science project
We got a floater
Guinea pig overboard
Stone sober hillbilly kid with open sores
We rip vocal chords
Tearing them out
A mute manifesto that you'll probably never hear about
Weirded out about my wearabouts
Swears pierce my mouth
A bearded medicine man who wears a pouch
Keeps diggin' me
And I'm swimmin' uphill
I'm fightin' the tide of mudslide and blood spilled
Until I got a shirt off my back
And a girl on attack
On top
With a curled lip
The world matches our bedsheet
We shared geography now
I explore virgin territory
Squeeky seats acting as a mating call
Nothing on me but her
And didn't feel naked at all
Ever feel the need
To keep it so real you feed
Yourself into her hunger and don't care if she bleeds
Askin' all these questions
Ain't highly recommended
They'll eventually get answered
If you put time in the friendship
That is if what you're doin' is helping
And it's not like you'll know until you ah-
Reach the ending
She wanted my
Agony agony agony
In her body
(Repeat x4 then continues throughout hook)
Day one I played with her blood
Day two left her face bruised and we called it making love
Day three her blood played with me
Dirty talk caught me off guard
Had the nerve to ask if I thought she was crazy
She was crazy
I need more holes to breathe from
Went under the knife
I contemplated freedom
Put it all out on the operating table
Clutching onto rubber ducks
I played double dutch with some jumper cables
And I broke like the water
It started rushing
All of a sudden
There she was gone
I'm the fall guy
She's a sight for sore eyes
I'm in labor all night till a new day is born
Her blow brocades like high rolled dice
Her exposing one eighty when I look into her snake eyes
I'm not afraid of dying
Pieces of me die all the time
I keep digging (I keep digging)
I leave the dirt to the experts
Who push the boundaries of pleasure till the sex hurts
I hold today with a death grip
And play hard to get with tomorrow
So as not to look so fucking desperate
Face sweaty
Hands unsteady
Blood pressure off the charts
My heart hangs heavy
Untreated wounds
Through repeated moons
I seem to have developed through your needy womb
Your feeble ill cocoon
I don't breathe for many people
I don't mourn the pieces killed in you
My injection must have been lethal
Pick up the shovel love
You got some diggin' to do
Agony agony agony

Water Line,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"I just sit there, and let the thoughts flood
And I remind myself it's all right, it's all good
It's all love, it's not though
Cause there's a kink in the armor
A pot hole I'm sinkin' in, while I think of the drama
So I stand up, I start to pace in my living room
Set my eye to the highway, knowin' that I'll play chicken soon
There's a vanity plate, with my name on it
There's a Davy Crocket hat with a masonic fat cat under it
A musket rifel spittin' at my feet
They want me to dance in the middle of the street
And I respect my elders, so I do as I'm told
But I've offset the bell curve when I do it with soul, losin' control
Guilty feet do have rhythm
They just dance to the wrong theme music to amuse the villian
Instead of killin', I spare the raccoon
And start fillin' sand bags as I stare at the moon
And let the thoughts flood, blessed are those who are damned
When the levy broke, how many choked on the steps of a slow dance
A staircase to a hug with no hands
Accountability hung out to dry on the line of command
We let the thoughts flood, we remind ourselves it's all right, it's all good
It's all love, it's not though
Cause there's a kink in the armor

Message Sent,Personal Journals,2002.0,"I've got some letters inside of my drawer
That should have been stamped and delivered
One is addressed to my ex
It says ""I'm the type of man who can't be lived with""
One is addressed to my friends
It says ""I'm a mess so y'all can't visit""
One is addressed to myself
But I don't know which personality or hand to give it
I'm a God-damned misfit, mismatched, but never missed much
Mr. right-time-wrong-place with a long face until our lips touch
I don't miss the mistrust, it's what got our messages mixed up
Before I rip up your letters let us see if I can tear you away from his clutch
This stuff's a whole other drawer
From a different dresser I'm not ready to address
I went to the west to get my mind off things, I'm already depressed
I give up, get let down, downplay, play games, put on my game face
Face my pharmaceutical needs, feed on my medicine, I don't like the way that it tastes
I go place to place without enough money to put a bed under me
I share my sleeping space with rodents, insects, and dust bunnies
I laugh at the mess I've created for myself until it gets unfunny
But I'm content in the fact that they don't expect respect, sex, love, or trust from me
When I'm hungry I can taste it
I hide in the basement
Check up on me every now and then
'Cuz my mood swings low, I can feel myself going down again
Falling off is easy, getting put on takes a bit of ass-kissing
I'd rather listen to myself flop on the ground than hear the sound of a mattress spring
I rap and sing and talk and write and often type with 2 fingers
The ""hunt and kill"" method
I edit one third of a word per second
Your emails sit in my unsent box. If you're a girl that I miss
You'll eventually get my virtual good bye kiss
The rest are addressed to my friends and the subject line is ""Just check this fine bitch""
And the one for myself's untitled but...it's the same virus
My wrists get slit on your shoulder blades
When I lose my grip when I hold your face
Let it drip on your golden laced silver slip
Spilling all over the place
I'd lay my jacket over the blood puddle when we go on dates
To prove I'm a gentleman, peddling my bike at a slower pace
""The sum of the parts doesn't equal the whole,"" she states
Before my parents get home I'll take
Time to find the fragments of our relationship
Glue back together this broken vase
Falling in love is easy. Falling out of love takes a bit of practice
I'm good at both without even owning a mattress
I never asked for a kiss without deserving one
If you never saw me cry before
Wait for the next time I wake up on the wrong side of the floor
I've got some letters inside of my drawer
That should have been sent by now
Sealed in an envelope
One is addressed to my ex
And it says that I feel our friendship's a joke
One is addressed to my friend
And it says his ex-girlfriend's on coke
And one is addressed to myself on a personal note
Unopened...filled with endless quotes
Whenever I spoke, they'd close me in and bust my lip
Now I wear parenthesis on my temples, step to the podium and just think
Whenever lonely I shrink, and hold myself, squeezing tight
Before I sprawl out on the hardwood floor and kiss myself to sleep at night
I have dreams of flight, but I'm not floating
The ground is approaching awful quick
So I wake up screaming for you to catch me
That's what I start every day off with
I may talk shit, but ain't much else to do in this prison cell
And lucky for me no one really listens well, especially when I diss myself
I'll fly away on a pig when my living hell freezes over
And since I'm used to the cold I'll be able to rest my head on Jesus' shoulder
Explanations are in order for why these floor boards are always freezing
Guess it'll all make sense once we get older and reach the Age of Reason
'Til then, I'll have no reason to sleep in, Not even on weekends
Unless we're together, 'cuz my willpower will probably weaken
Deepen my appreciation for the current condition
'Cuz I'm sick of always feeling like something is missing
I slumber in one position. Crouched up and fetal-like
The couch sucks cuz my feet are like...given no space to breathe
While I embrace my knees
Its off to the floor 'cuz I can't sleep nowhere else
That's why I write these letters to all of y'all but never send 'em
It's better to just keep to myself",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-message-sent-lyrics

It's complicated and you say, ""Pray tell""
And now we'll try, if I miss any details
Think about it later and send it in an email
Cause my brain is on a loop, but there's a buzz
That I need to troubleshoot, not now
Gotta gotta get the work done
Last item of the day is turnin' to the first one
I, never gonna never gonna
I, never gonna never gonna
I, ain't gonna ever gonna die
Huh, pedal to the medal, gonna get ahead
Gonna run another red light in the dead of the night
Lettin' the light from my cellphone distract my eyes
Sexual text message into my mind
Fingers are busy,
 but now I'm lookin' in the mirror
Cause the people behind me, they're givin' me the middle finger
I'm kill'em if they pull up any closer to my bumper
Short-tempered mother... shut your mouth!
Drinkin' the coffee, now I'm dumpin' it out
He's honkin' the horn like ""You wanna throw down""
He thinks, ""Oh boy, you wanna go now""
I'm ready (I'm ready), for the typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
(di-di-di-difficult isn't it)
I'm a just man, with a company van
And a supervisor who just does a summary scan
And a coworker who's always like ""just cover me, man""
In the morning we all get in the huddle again
Like ""Can we even make more money""
I wonder what the luxury is really taken from me
I don't even have to worry (ha-ha-ha-hiiii)
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedient people
Are gonna die, cause they can't live my life
All eyes on the small guys makin' small noise
In a small town with the small music men
They're just fall guys, in the law's eyes
Your voice is worth more than you know and you're not foolin' anyone
I'm not a con-artist, 
you pencil in your promises, eroding eraser tips
I'm sick of your colleges, expensive taste tester, ""Spit that wine""
Excessive waste, yes, but it's that time
For me to get randomly checked again
Bored until you're marked with a blood-red pen
Water bottle sittin' in my pocket and I'm walkin' with a grin
Cause the liquid isn't permitted, I'm rippin' up the ticket
For the lady at the counter as confetti in her face
Shoulda never let me in this place
Fly, fly boy in the brownest state
I feel I'm never gonna be let out the gate, because I'm the bomb
Yea I said it; cool, collected and calm
Maneuver through the computer to do a little song
My music got the charm, smoother than a cougar
Attack the mic and get on the intercom
Hello passengers, fellow activists, whether you're masochists
Mellow pacifists, tell those faxin' it, it's no accident
By the end of this record, you're gonna know
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedience
Typically cyclical simple civil obedient people
Are you listenin', love? 
We got a 30 for us
Can you hand me enough, can you hand me my stuff
Bout to move out this scary cemetery of trust
Livin' just a little bit of it isn't nearly enough
Livin' just a little bit of it isn't nearly justified
Because ah-ah-ah-I, ah-ah-ah-I am
Never gonna never gonna never gonna never gonna die
(Sage Speaking)
I wanna kee- I wanna keep making things an-and death really is
Is uh not to be part of my eh-eh-everyday activities
It's not to be in my music anymore, I don't want it there
It'll-it'll sneak its way in and out, but that's that's, we're beyond that
I mean de-de-death only as a concept is what matters and-and
God as a concept is-is-is one of those huge things to me
And to you, I know you, I know you much better than you think I do uhh
I hope we meet sometime, I'd love to shake your hand and um maybe get a kiss
Uh right there, on my face
And uh I don't know maybe have sex a little bit",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-civil-disobedience-lyrics
Thank You,Copper Gone,2014.0,"You gave me language as a gift, I turned it against you
I was stupid, I was young, I was hanged by my Judas tongue
You shouldn’t give weapons to kids that don’t know better
They can't possibly understand that there’s no such thing as forever
For every letter in the alphabet
You said connect ‘em to a happy word, no matter how bad things get
I did my best, but the pickings got slim
Once I arrived at “X” and I had to think of synonyms
Weighed ‘em against the antonyms, I was hanging with all the mannequins
Who are on a constant search for a person’s amputated limbs
Almost offered up my own, trading in my arms and legs
You said, ""Learn to express yourself if you’re gonna stand for things.""
I stood up without expression, stood up against everything including you
I was stupid, I was adolescent, but I had your lessons to cling on to
And I want you to know how much it helped
Considering everything that I’d gone through
There was a period without periods, run on sentences were like binges
I was a comma with no pause, a rebel with no clause
Anxiety is no excuse once there’s nothing left to separate
We could have connected, but didn’t
I was ignorant, passed out on the spacebar
The further we drifted apart the closer
I came to realizing just how amazing you are
Now that you’re gone I'mma say it to the stars
‘Til my words knock worlds off their axis and the universe collapses

Thank you for the matches, for the gift of fire
For the wood and the axe, for whooping my ass
For the wheel even if you didn’t invent it
For the impact that you had on me, it’s epic, thank you for the effort
For teaching me the ABC’s even if I never make my way to “Z”
Even if I never do for someone else exactly what you did for me
Thank you

I was a stupid son of a gun with initials carved into me
I was a stray, a runaway, afraid someday you’d shoot me
So I scratched off the letters with a pocket knife
That’s how I loss my way when I was tossed into the fray
This is not my life, who am I kidding, this is a thank you note
Disguised as a written apology for everything you taught to me
So awkwardly I approach the open microphone with everything that I wrote
Clear my throat, adjust the collar on my coat
As I rock crowds, microphones and boats and then I stroke
Whatever little ego I have left, I should have left it at the alter
But I didn’t cause I’m an idiot, self-deprecating author
With a paperback edition that isn’t worth a flip through
If I don’t give you the credit that you deserve
You edited the words from the grave and beyond
From the first sign of sun rays at dawn
'Til the moonbeams set blaze to my lawn
The universe collapses on my front steps
So we get to share in that moment, for just one moment
And nobody’s upset, there’s no more anger, there’s no more sunsets
So I crawl back in the chamber, you can shoot me up
You might as well, we had great communication before the tower fell


I'mma do my best, while you rest in peace",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-thank-you-lyrics
The Place She Feared Most,Copper Gone,2014.0,"Oh you wrong, you gots to get right with yourself
Sinner please, you could never get with the god
Oh you wrong, you gots to get right with yourself
Sinner please, you could never get with the god

Don't wanna fake that smile, don't wanna have that talk
Don't wanna make that child or let the suspect walk
Don't wanna take it to trial or settle out of court
Just wanna shoot down the stork
Don't want a long disclaimer as a preference to your short story
Don't wanna sum up in one sentence why your sort bores me
In fact, one more word out of you and the girl gets it
You're so bossy in a world that has no work ethic
So let's shake to that, don't wanna give you dap
Or figure out whatever hand dance you're bringing back
For I am not a tween, don't wanna talk with memes
Or let the internet infiltrate all my dreams
So what do I want? Want now?
To exercise my right to be hostile and drop trou
Hey, you, get off that cloud
You don't know what that technology allows
I don't wanna wait it out, don't wanna be more patient
Don't want a bank account charging me for paper statements
Don't want no ancient astrology stopping me
From boarding the spaceship once it gets to our colony cause

All I ever wanted was space
Cause all I ever wanted was space
Cause all I ever wanted was space
Cause all I ever wanted was the place she feared most

I could mock a killingbird without dropping a single word
Flip the middle finger 'til they start thinning the herd
My cattle call becomes a death ring, butt-dial a booty call
To a red phone in the west wing. Y'all are soon to fall
For the oldest-known joke in the phone book (what the fuck's the phone book?)
It's like a black book for fat folks who don't cook
Pick-up or delivery? Sick of this chivalry
Just tell me what you're willing to give to me and we go from there
Well hello there, dressed to impress but going nowhere?
""Oh yeah!"" Well, let's go there
Grown man flirting like it hurts him that he has to bother
Is that your baby, baby bubba? Does he have a father?
Don't be insulted, that was off the top freestyle
Still battle rappers for the custody like ""Please, child
These styles are fatherless, motherless, marvelous""
Adopted by every hip hop George Papadopoulos
Freak the violin, fiddle with its contours
Trick 'em with a happy ending, riddle 'em with encores
Looking for a little bit of cinnamon while on tours
Negatively affects what I originally signed on for
Don't wanna fake that smile
Don't wanna have that talk
Don't wanna make that child
Or let the suspect walk
Don't wanna take it to trial or settle out of court
Just wanna shoot down the stork

Carries a paint gun
She's unafraid of waivin' when she's getting her face done
Her favorite radio station's a permanent paid vacation
Burning her face in the sun
She loves repetitive songs that keep playin'
You know, the repetitive songs that keep playin'?
She learned all the words and she works it baby
Dangerously catchy and she feels it in her cervix lately
Cause the rhythm is a cancer
She's on a secret diet
A private viewing disease free TV pilot
She saw the future in a group study
They threw money in her pants


Don't

Live for the constant
Die for what's right or get killed by your conscience
There's a difference between conscience, conscious, and conscientious
Contrary to popular belief
You're none of these

The kept down and apes won't be banging on their chests now
When pacemakers are fragile
They hate the taste of capsules
They feed their face with Paxil
Females hate their dad still
Holy sons got mommy issues on deck at the podium
Holding tongues with the rituals more complex than Napoleon

It isn't his job
To live in a fog
I don't have a god complex, you got a simple god

Take me to your local drug dealer

With your hand on the trigger
And a can of Miller in the other
You can't kill me motherfucker

You best disconnect before I call it
The bumper sticker on your forehead's the wrong fit

Embarrassed,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"Look at me for a second
No, seriously, look at me
Honestly, ask yourself
Lookin' at me, do you really think that there is any way possible for you to embarrass me?
Look at me! Do you 
really
 think I care what you think?
Do you 
really
 think I care what you say?
Look at me!
[Hook: 
Eyedea
, Sage Francis]
I'm embarrassed by my past actions and even more ashamed
By my present thoughts and future endeavors to clear my name
I'm embarrassed by my past actions and even more ashamed
By my present thoughts and future endeavors to clear my name
I'm embarrassed (
why?
)
I'm embarrassing (
what?
)
I'm an embarrassment (
why?
)
And it's all adding up 

I'm so preoccupied with self-indulgency to see
What you provided me, I fully appreciate your offerings
The awful things in life are lessened
By lessons of self-acceptance
I want blessings
I regret keeping a distance
For future reference over ridges are preventable, I know the traps
Humanity as a whole or we'll collapse, now close the gaps
We dwell on what we share, what separates us
We're all different, but what makes us a unit?
Music is a universal language, so is anguish, pain, and torment
Balance of emotions, it shows a happiness have upon us
No more pickin' sides, one without the other is impossible
(Uh, forgot what I was supposed to say)
They call it bipolar, unstable conditions, they got me lookin' over my shoulder
The book that I wrote ya was meant to move the time slower
But it was spent cookin' my mind's motor, now I'm older

I'm embarrassed by my past actions and even more ashamed
By my present thoughts and future endeavors to clear my name
Embarrassed by my past actions and even more ashamed
By my present thoughts and future endeavors to future 
I'm embarrassed
 (why?)
I'm embarrassing
 (what?)
I'm an embarrassment
 (why?)
And it's all addin' up
 

It was in the cards that I’m to be forever haunted
Hip hop is slowly but surely becoming the Big Brother
I never wanted homie to hurt me, purely to mic
Still my head is astonished with sonics, aesthetics
Poetics and knowledge, some polished rhetoric
Everything has its negative
Conscience consciously at it
Constantly get rid of the rigorous repetitive movements
Been better than you since
It's easier to talk to you about it than to do it
Here I am, center of the spotlight
They all drunk and smilin', waiting for their cockfight
""Time to entertain,"" says the clock of life
So I became the freaky kid I'm starin' at
Even though you know it's not right
Embarrassment, it's in between insecurity and arrogance
I'm a machine with a clarity I can barely grip
So if I seem red in the face, it's not 'cause I feel out of place
It's just that

I'm embarrassed by my past actions and even more ashamed
By my present thoughts and future endeavors to clear my name
Embarrassed by my past actions and even more ashamed
By my present thoughts and future endeavors to kill the breakdown

And I can yell all day, all night, all day
I still doubt that you would hear a word I say
And I can drive all night, all day, all night
But if you stay with me, you'll never get it right 

I was never much for the self-driven skepticism
I was that cat that let distraction affect my vision
You were the kitten that was screaming
Cover up the sound of landing or crashing, however it was going down
But it's goin' down, it's goin' fast
And I have no doubts about whether or not it's gonna last
Fill the glass, tilt your head back
Let it trickle through the throat to where you hide your giggles and your laughs
I'll wait (I'm waitin') to find the correct departure time (departure time)
Shine my eyes (shine my eyes) to keep the lies from climbin' up inside the mind (inside the mind)
Some belong to you and some belong to me
But none of them escape the contemplation necessary
You can't scare me (uh-uh) but you can keep it buried
Put your hands on the circle, try to steer me
And now that I sing (sing) all of my songs for singing (singing)
I'm guessing that it's just a test to see how strong I can bring it",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-embarrassed-lyrics
Bridle,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"Sometimes a girl

Will come and go

Sometimes a girl
(You will be like, real happy)
Will come and go

Maze broken, she's running, feet swollen, he's coming, cheese stolen
And before he even knows it she's gone
Tea cups sitting on the hollow tree stumps
He's dumped and can't seem to swallow these lumps; the beat goes on
Same fire, new passion, old flame: trade it in for a summer fling
It's nothing like that sweet old song
Tip over, root the trees, bend the leaves
Blend in with the open wound; the freeze frames keep him warm
The day's frost is scraped off; the weight loss
The new sign that says ""keep off"" as he speeds off into the storm
Out of spite the lighting strikes him twice
He's peeking out on the pike and cheating life, peeling out on the lawn
Now he's idling; his time is dwindling
In his mind he's figuring out life's about the little things
And his labyrinth in all its magnificence can only keep the mice trapped
The princess is innocent; she doesn't belong
I never thought I'd miss you
They had a ceremony where he put her in a bridle, the headstall
She stopped to think for a minute, and in a split second went AWOL
I never thought I'd miss you
He draws in the chin as in a expression of resentment or scorn
He's pulling on 
the reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war
The reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, high tower, clouds are at war
The reins, the bridle, the shower, the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war
Clouds are at war, the clouds are at war

Say Uncle,Copper Gone,2014,"Eternal flame above my headstone
The set that I claim is null
X made of bones, it's revenge for the decaying skull
A raging bull 'til I'm paid in full
They wanna put my face in a penny, then discontinue me. I'm still grateful
If we're not allowed to age gracefully
I'm putting it all out on the table, exactly what will you take from me?
Choose carefully 'cause a magical head
Has no phantom power source and the battery's are dead
Supposed to keep my head up, at the same time drop my shoulder
To plow through the nonsense, since I've gotten older
I've replaced too many parts in this motor
Mama said, ''Knock down the house - start over''
Sometimes it feels like life is too long, but not forever enough
One day you can't give it away, the next you basically beg for the stuff
Medical breakthrough, buy your time, sell it to us
For heaven is an electrical pulse, an adrenaline rush
The metal will rust, rust never sleeps, it’s death and taxes
Get a better conversion rate on cash because the past is a foreign land with futuristic looking doormats
Sitting aside of our present home which really isn't all that
So we started taking pictures with vintage filters
The villagers all starting to shop at Urban Outfitters
I couldn't distinguish any specific difference
Betwixt small town hicks and big city slickers
Homogenous time zone from Westcoast to Eastcoast
Now I’m so post-post that I’m pre-post
Beat most at their own game
I try to eat toast that's wholegrain
And I don't need to bo-bo-bo-bo-bo to blow brains
Make 'em say uncle
I don't give up, I don't give in
What's with this polluted gene pool that we all swim in?
This is 5 foot 10 inches of wishful thinking
I never signed a social contract so in fact there's no rescinding
You can kindly cross my name off
I've been living a double life to work a double shift that never paid off
This is the second sunset I've seen since take-off
If life is a cakewalk I'll serve you in the bake off

Make 'em say uncle, make 'em say uncle
Who? Make 'em say uncle - huh
Make 'em say uncle - who?
Make 'em say uncle, uncle
You know what I am
Say what, say what?
I'm a bad, bad man
Make 'em
Make 'em say uncle, make 'em say uncle
Who? Make 'em say uncle - huh
Make 'em say uncle - who?
Make 'em say uncle, uncle
Drowned by the bloods that's on their hands
Say what, say what?
Got damn

The gravedigger creeps into the crypt then strips the bed
To find agendas that are hidden like pigeon eggs
Instead he finds nothing, only ink dipped feathers
And a sense perhaps the homie's homing instincts been severed
The coops been fled to recoup on these boots of lead
Can't hear the primal screams or see through the red
I represent the late bloomers with great rumors to spread
Our brain is like an inflated tumor in the head
Now build a mountain of bills and debt, climb it with a velvet rope
The creditors can't find you with a telescope, run tell your folks
You love them dearly, but it's time for the birdie to fly
Pack some self-addressed envelopes and kiss the world goodbye
You're on our own with celestial oats to the sow
And extraterrestrial souls to know, you're a homegrown information capsule
With increased value the more you travel
Don't let them plant you in the gravel
Even shackles have shackles, that's a shadow reference
We like to break the chains of darkness, then we ask for seconds
It's the heart of the Oliver Twisted. Calling all mystics
I don't advocate the Diablo, Pablo runs the repo man resistance
This is a four decade's worth of false first impressions, youngin
Death comes in three's, you're soon to see the second coming
My dad told me I was destined for something
Despite the fact that I felt like less than nothing
He said ""Fuck 'em, gotta make 'em say uncle""


I'm not just an uncle, I'm somewhat poet
I'm a dead milk mental
An obscure top ten list essential
Welcome to the incredible shrinking Indian giving tree
Time to return the sap, that shit isn't free
Need to keep my head up, at the same time drop my shoulder
To plow through the nonsense, since I've gotten older
I've replaced too many parts in this motor

I let them take my camera so they can make their rounds
Thandiwe want's some paper. More paper. More paper
She's the boss. She draws Christmas trees with snow
I'm taking 'em home. All home
To the snowmen to show them what I think they need to know
About Zinhle, Sfundo, Zakheni
Snetemba…survivor…a promise made to many
An army of old souls in a battlefield of scattered ashes
Lost ancient wisdom, and ignored AIDS symptoms
UBUNTU. What's good for me is good for you
These brave soldiers combat the enemies of truth
In a broken system with an open wound that will never heal
If we just accept the way it is and never deal
An infection can spread to the head if you let it
Don't let it affect the way you think…like ""this is it.""
Oh, this is it? That's all there is for all these kids?
These warriors? A never ending waiting list at an orphanage?
As water drips in the bucket, I could add another drop
But I've got a feeling…that drop won't fix the leaky ceiling
If the leak gets fixed, what about when the roof collapses?
Six siblings sleeping on a single mattress

I've seen kids risk exposing themselves to a social stigma
In the name of breaking patterns and cycles of ignorance
Hearts full of hope, eyes full of innocence
These are heros. Now I call to the heads of State
Recognize greatness when it's in your face
I traveled half the globe to see boys and girls stuck
Without assistance. You insisted on hosting the World Cup?
That ain't love, brother. What happened to you?
You beautified the parts of the city that tourists travel through
You built a gorgeous stadium that can't sustain itself
Flexing superficial muscles in a false display of wealth
Your most important resources need major help
Think of how the medication and information on AIDS is dealt
Beautify the way you save yourself
For God's sake, for human sake, for the sake of public health
One medicine drop in a bucket eventually evaporates
The socks I bought Zakheni won't fix fractures or breaks
It's not my suffering. It's not my needlessly complex infrastructure
It's not my culture. Nevertheless I see you
Sawubona. Yebo. Unjani. How YOU doin'? I'm fine

Andy Kaufman,Still Sick... Urine Trouble,UnKnown,"Now I know it ain't right, but I decided I had to
Us poets paint life, but don't get recognized till after
So I faked my own death just to see what would happen
As I take shallow breaths and wait for people's reaction
It was funny at first, but I had to hold my laughter...wait
Before long I was on display at an open casket wake
And I'm the main attraction who draws a crowd
A freak show of sorts
Good thing my skin is pale enough to pass as a decomposing corpse
Frozen in my thoughts, laying stiff, playing with
People's emotions and awaiting a kiss from praying
Lips that I hate but miss
She didn't show, although she sent a card with flowers
How considerate, little bitch would make me sit in my car for hours
Heartless powers start to devour my patience, it gets me violent
I'm ready to fly shit and end everything like ""I quit""
Then again I sit deathly quiet, biting my tongue
Just excited that some kids who were invited to come did
I'm the center of attention, the talk of the town
It ain't all that profound
But on this special day of mine I'm the one the universe revolves around
It's like a birthday, kind of
I also found that it's the worst way to find love
White doves battle black crows in one of the back rows
And everybody my ass knows back home is sporting black clothes
Looking glum as usual, it's all too familiar
I put the fun back into funeral
My morbid humor'll kill ya
For all that it's worth, people who I thought were jerks
Were putting on the water works and it sorta hurts
My momma stroked my hair with so much care but hardly spoke
Now my heart is broke, and yeah I should've let her in on the joke
But I'm honestly choked up, and I'm stuck holding back my tears
As I absorb the atmosphere, ""I wanna turn back, I'm scared""
Then a hand touches my shoulder to calm my nerves
And something odd occurs because I heard my father's words
So I got disturbed, as he expressed what he's never said
What bothered me the most is that I remembered, he's dead
I manifested destiny
The best and worst of worlds has come true
As I'm buried alive, in the back of my mind echoes his words
""I love you""

Irony is a funny bastard
I mean you gotta be funny
When your mere existence is totally dependent upon God's twisted sense of humor
And I could cut this kid with a knife he's living so thick
The knife struck
Over privileged kids try to tell me life sucks
Men preoccupy their minds
Thinking about all the guys their wives had sexual relations with
I'd have patience if the innocence weren't lost
But when I scrub my hands the purity rinsed off
And when I scrubbed some more protective gloves tore
The only thing saving me from loving...Her",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-andy-kaufman-lyrics
Runaways,Personal Journals,2007.0,"(Sage Francis)
It's time to rethink every fact that is imaginable
Survival instinct dwells in a past that is inhabitable
I happen to pull fast ones over the slow parole board
Who likes to speak to de-fanged wolves who cry sheep
Time seeps into our skin, age indicates how long we've been lost in space
I keep putting expressionless looks on my face
An awful waste of human skin who waits for Autumn to begin
My fall from grace will do me in too late
(I'm out of season)
No spring chicken, summer romance novel writer could win a prize
It's Nobel , go to hell in a riding vehicle that he winterized
I change my mind more often then my undergarments
Aout abortion and other nonsense
I'm an orphan who comes from Providence
I am a sign from God! ...to the parentally misguided
(And I know...)
This state is not an ocean, not an island, not a road
If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?
It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home
(And I know...)
This state is not an ocean, not an island, not a road
If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?
It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home...
...to where? The land of the lost souls
Feeling a loneliness that really only exists in abandoned foster homes
How many images of missing kids can be fit onto a milk carton?
Framed, they're starting to look the same
Starting to say his name, and claim privileges
As if they found HIM!
The strangest little kids surrounding the circle of false friendship
Rings of fire are connected at the elbow
Cause they're tired moms unexpectedly let go
The Velcro light component that keeps there unit cohesive
It's the music! So we give reasons to get sober
Life experiences to hum to
These kids play Red Rover and look for weaknesses to run through
With reckless abandon they stand and refuse to go down
Pinballs in their machine bounce between abusive homes now
If its fight or flight, they'll just choose to throw down
Ain't nothing like beating a dead horse, riding it through a ghost town
I move with no sound... I used to think I was invisible
Til they stopped me mid-stride and said
""I think I seen a picture of you...""
Picture that, I said ""Nah I just got one of them faces
Placed next to an expiration date that changes""
I kind of look familiar, my name is on the tip of your tongue
The lost look on my face makes you play dumb
""Say something colloquial
I need to get my bearings and a feel for where I'm at""
But you ain't hearin' that
They shout ""freeze!"" I'm a tourist trapped by townies
Who put bounties out on me in all surrounding counties
Before I bounce, I hear them shout
""Can someone help us out, PLEASE!""
We're all alone in the foster home
Killin' ourselves with the house keys...
Not every broken home can come equipped with a fix-it man
And it's a smelly mess once the shit hits the fan
Kids just stand in their circle jerks with their dicks in the sand
Saying ""FUCK THE WORLD"" cause they ain't got no girl
But who do they think I am?
Think again, I'm not that quick to plan ahead of time
I'm two steps behind the schedule, they pretend to have read my mind
I think they just misread the lines in the palm of my hand, 'cause
They're random scars caused by slap boxin' with landlords
I ran with the dogs till I realized they were all mutts
Turned bitch once the dog catcher caught up
Forced into trucks, boarded up, put to sleep in the pound
Being an orphan sucks, but I'm through with sneaking around
I see my frown posted up on street lights
And telephone poles, from what they show it seems like
I never grow old, from what they show it seems like
I never go home, and that doesn't seem right
Cause they won't let me grow...
And this is where some go
To avoid the sunrays and the noise of subways
Emerging introverted, unemployed and unshaved
I feel rewarded offering a finder's fee that I know no one will pay
And this is where some go
To avoid the sunrays and the noise of subways
Emerging introverted, unemployed and unshaved
I've got multiple personalities and my inner children are runaways

If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?

Specialist,Personal Journals,2002.0,"The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
And that's simply adorable
When my time is affordable
Dimes pay the price I get abusive and that's the truth
It's just a fucking shame this is how I choose to communicate
Excuses I produce have their roots in the music I make
She's not a fan nor am I famous
I may just change and adjust when I branch out
Leave, get off my damn couch and achieve
What I dream about leave my house hand out my keys
To the sleepless beauty who failed math class and can't count her Z's
The tree dies
She says that she's mine she's my proprietress
Can't hold on to most of what I owned
Besides she likes to kiss and that's cute
I hug her till I start to hurt her
She wants to dance to my pulse but I've got heart murmurs
A shark circles our lifeboat till its fin folds
The monster we created might choke in clothes
I'm naked walking tight ropes without big toes
Couldn't see this with the night-scope if my skin glowed
Fallen
Calling for a safety net
The great white might drain me of my life
Bite into my veiny neck where dreams are falling asleep
Could dry up once she sees that I bleed off beat
Head over heels cause she's tripping on her own feet
That puzzled look on her face still isn't complete
She gives bits and pieces of herself
While I'm breaking myself open I pour my contents to her shelf
Pardon me but is that me wearing my heart out on my sleeve
With razor sharp teeth gnawing at my wrist how beautiful is this
The most beautifullest thing in this world
Is making up words when I have none else left to say to a girl
Making her curl up in a ball in a corner of my eye
Taking a time out I don't want her to cry
I don't ever want to be considered the sort of guy
Who says, ""I just might break your face tonight""
I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me away blow me away
I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me out
When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals
Over average marriage materialist mister righteous
A savage miscarriage of just us just us
And a dust that never settles
I'm restless spread some metal to make it weep
Cause discussing the ugly nobody wants to fuck with
Don't touch me
Under appreciative with a with a hundred weaknesses
What do I need to live?
The blood I bleed is thicker than the skin I shoot people with
Need a fist to the air
Pretend to make believe she cares
To open up old wounds and usual bruises on my ego appear
I'm a low self-esteem engine in need of a horsepower
Out of sleeping powder
Dark clouds follow me with heat seekers
I need a colder shower
The showboat won’t expose his open-ended quest
Cause it won't float if it turns out these are permanent echoes in his chest
I think its best to turn the reverb down
Kill the delay
Get me the fuck out of this cave
I could paint you pictures all day
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals that way
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals today
The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
She thinks I'm something special
She's my specialist
More beautiful than sex
Cause only something like sex
Makes something so lovely turn ugly and fuck up shit
I'm holding a sleepless beauty pageant
On my shark-infested waterbed until it's punctured
I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until I pull a muscle
I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until its see through
Spread my love like the legs of a crack whore

You dance around me like a fire
Blow me away blow me away blow me away blow me away

Mermaids are Seasluts,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"I am nothing but a shell of the man I once was
So you can put me to your ear and actually hear yesteryear's ocean
I was in shape then
A much better built body of water with infinite waves and fathomless depths
Where you could have gone deep sea fishing for compliments
And caught plentiful schools of reassuring comments
Now all you get is the boot
You fell for the bait and got hooked on what you thought I was
Now we're both struggling to win this tug of war of the worlds
Where we breathe the same air, it's just done differently
And I'm tryin to figure out ways to have comfortably survive outside your element
Compromising intelligence
I dabbled in watered down thoughts that filtered in from the main stream
I'm offering mind altering ideas that make the most quiet natured brain scream
From exposure to the types of things that won't necessarily make you happier
They'll just give you a greater range of emotions
And I can feel myself getting lured into deeper oceans of 'Fantasy Land'
Where people think they're as safe as cartoons simply because they speak in bubbles
A sanitized safe-haven where you could face Satan and have his faith straightened
His new goal would be to dethrone Poseidon and have Neptune's place taken
They'd swashbuckle with their pitchforks
While Lucifer shit talks and rips forts of coral reef
For relief he'd be like ""bitch walk""
From this oversized aquarium that daddy kept cleanly to unhealthy degrees
Writing suicide notes with invisible ink on transparencies
And posting them to the glass boundaries that surround the seas of change
Strangely enough, while bringing back the real(reel)
I could sense intense resistance so I had no other choice but to cut the line
I'm not saying you're overly naive
I just think you should get into the habit of checking to see when strings are attached
Fortunate for you I'm compassionate enough to throw back what I catch
If it's underdeveloped and needs time to grow
Though I'm remorseful of the pain I've caused you
And I want to kiss your lips better
I sympathize with the sorrow by stroking the scar
Of my own traumatic experience with my excommunicated tongue
So I know exactly what you mean when you say it hurts too much to talk
I've been there; I don't plan on returning cause
No matter how much of a distance I kept or how long I waited for my wounds to heal
They'd re-open with the slightest flashback
So I sued time for malpractice
That bastard's a hack with a rusty scalpel and barbed-wire stitch thread
Instead of seeing things clearly, they're pitch red
And there's this glitch in my head that's got me thinking contradictions, it said:
""There are more fish in the sea
Whether you hear me not or you listen to me
Whether you listen to me or hear me not""
There are more microorganisms in my teardrop
But fear not, I'd never sink as low as to make my ears pop
And I imagine now you only want to swim with members of your own league
And you don't need me meddling, sending sonar signals
High pitched notes are symbols, my voice is thrown far
But ripples are only caused when you cast stones
But you shouldn't throw rocks if you live in fragile fairytales
Girl: ""This really means something to me; I'll always treasure it as a token""
Guy: ""No you won't, cause this is for the girl who loves me
The girl who cares about me for who I am, not what I look like
I just wanted you to know you'd be missing
You think I don't appreciate art, you think I don't understand fashion
You think I'm not ""hip"", you think I'm pathetic
A nerd, a lard-ass, fatso, you think I'm shit
Well you're wrong, cause I'm champagne
And you're shit, until the day you die
You, not me, will always be shit""",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-mermaids-are-seasluts-lyrics

Sage Francis...Personal Journalist, 1968 to 2001
(Verse 1)
He left with deep breaths in each chest that needs less innovating
Cause they're still debating over what rhyme skill is
Sick of waiting for time killers to get over there murder raps
And then he sold his own shirt off his back for cheap exposure
Seek for closure but stayed open minded
Always seemed to keep composure, peeking over both his eyelids
Speaking vulgar in misleading cultures of ultra violence
Teaching others how to be more loving with brotherly guidance
A bleeding soldier knows the science
He does the math quick and writes without having to think twice
Without asking for advice, letting the scalps peel
Having brains picked by head lice before the scabs heal
His death mask conceals his face paint
It feels like a safe place, but it ain't
Feels like its safety seals faith, but it don't
He's not a real saint, just another one of those religious political jokes
And that's not even half of the nutshell
Cats are compelled to crack open and extract his blood cells
From, when he comes back from hell again
He'll have a few bones to pick with a fractured skeleton

Devoted son, father to none
(Verse 2)
Husband to something soulless
He didn't spend his life on what we love
The hardest workers in showbiz need no diamond studded glove
His time is up! He's still the type of boy who makes a comeback
Kill the white noise til the sun's black
Moonwalk around New York City and get murdered
By flocks of sheep who square-dance circles inside a box of beats
The California Dream sequences end quick
Got to find middle ground in little towns
That's the Midwest tradista, for something
Fell for every trick in the book
So he stopped believin, in the Avant-Garden of Eden
Get off the cross! Of course we need the wood to burn a godless heathen
Catch him red handed only if his palms are bleeding

Crumble,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"They've said it every year but this times it seems like
The end is near and I'm in line to see the light
How far does this black tunnel go
I got a car but the gas is running low
And as long as I've known the bumps and creeks of this house
It's starting to make the types of sounds that only comes from people's mouths
You can't tell me it's still settling
Built on an indian burial ground killing everything
The childhood scar on my chin is back again
That old jump over my own leg dance move has to end
I've seen better days in my night terrors
I was a bike messenger without a bike and I would write letters
Ask directions to your whereabouts
Before the slow walk the rest of the show-offs were pealing out
To many hares only one tortoise
Thats why I left this city, too fast paced for this HO-HUM Taurus
By the time I developed the pictures
They're as blurry as my memory of constant life fixtures
If distance is a girl's best friend
Tell them bitches in the rough who think that love comes with diamonds
Slave labor, you made me work for what I couldn't have
Diamonds cut, but coal burns and nothing lasts forever
Wonder why I bothered saving any of your letters
They're just aged paper
Crumble
Slave labour, you made me work for what I couldn't have
Diamonds cut, but coal burns and nothing lasts
Wonder why I saved your urn of ashes
I've got an insecurity box for your mail
Tracing the name on the return adress as if it was made of braille
Pretended it was your finger but careful to not break a nail
The one that sealed the coffin shut when it opened caused a paper trail
But since then I buried your dead sea scrolls
And emptied my head of these old trivial memories that I seem to hold
Now you're a foot note with cement shoes
In case you wonder what that sinking feeling has been ever since I left you",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-crumble-lyrics

What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
We're burnin’ at both ends, it's safe to assume
What doesn't consume the flame the flame consumes
MAINT REQD, push through the pain
What the flame does not consume consumes the flame
Burnin’ at both ends, we're hoping and praying for rain

Listen: a lie is just a lie if you believe that they'll believe it
Otherwise it's just some sly legal speak, so we keep our secrets
I wrap mine up in a silk robe
They prance around the home like princesses obsessed with kissing every toad
But ain't no prince here
In fact, I had to slay the dragon I was chasing for the warts to disappear
And dissect the frog, cut through the fog and do my thing
In the land of the pigs, the butcher is king
This is two-hundred and sixty pounds of ground meat in a town sound sleep
Countin' cards while they count sheep
Now I'm on a sacrificial lam, it's collapse of the iron lung
Had to remove the mask and ask what kind of trash am I among?
Caught in the widow's web the black spiders spun
Taking a beating that’s so ancient that it's basically a tribal drum
I'm seeing stars and constellations
Seeing warning signals in the universe's dashboard they're all saying

Knit me a sweater with the intestines of attention whores

Circular logic is foul talk (it’s mental sex for sport!)
Abuse me like customer service (I'll be your tech support!)
I'm sorry to hear you're having problems
It must be difficult.  Let me see if I can help you like… figure 'em out
Have you listened to Biz Mark's ""Just a Friend""?
Have you tried turning me off and back on again?
If you Make-A-Wish on a foundation and there's maintenance required
All I ask is you be careful when you state what you desire
They set satanists on fire without breaking a sweat
All that pagan shit is tired, so I'm taking a rest
I met my date at the pyre.  She was shorter than I like
But wore a dress that's as long as the night. Then I saw the light

Yeah, I’d settle on a bed of rusty nails instead of roses
'Cause a thorn by any other name and so on and so forth

Got a harem full of knife throwers who use my back for target practice
I fucks with them butcher-types
Inherited this cutlery along with the scars, and they all look alike
Used to write confessions in between the lines
And wear long sleeves so no one else could read my mind
Now I exercise my right to bare arms when I write words
The last polar bear taking a final stand on a melting iceberg
Where nothing is exclusive or told confidence
Sex could get abusive but everyone consents
Anything that’s lucrative gets reduced to checks
And now you’re wondering where your fair share of the fucking profit is
Sorry kids, the piggy bank's depleted
Got a million dollar smile, but not the pretty face that’s needed
Procede toward me, doggy. I never tapped the bottle or twisted the cap whenever they passed the forty
I’m fat boy disorderly.  Nothing fun about obesity
But recently, I toyed with it morbidly
Cordially invite you to the incredible, mind that bends metal
No spoon is safe, no fork is too special

How heavily the plot twist depends on a little bit of

The Set Up,Copper Gone,2014,"I set it up, you knocked it down, lay the foundation, I built this house
I feel cracks underneath my feet, I feel cracks underneath my feet
The walls are breathing heavy, sucking up the oxygen with no plans of leaving any
For as long as I’ve been hoarding, it’s taking me forever to gather up all my belongings

I get attached, and they're attached to people who I’ve loved and lost
Even though I've got to admit, there are few who’ve run me off
But I’m under no illusion how relationships get ruined
How I’m ain't shit to this movement when I’m just stuck to a cross
Tossed into the underworld and given specific info
Forced to find another girl sick of living in limbo
But I have my songs to play so I got lost along the way
And now I’ll never see the light of day thanks to the tinted limo
I was hopelessly romantic, emphasis on antic
Now I roam hopeless along the open coast of the Atlantic
Bought an overcoat that says “Francis, Showboat Captain”
Did my best to scrub it off because it’s utterly embarrassing
Every night I’d re-write my will on a sandbar napkin
I’d crash after sticking it to the window of my cabin
Once I awoke I’d notice it, read it, then remove it
Just stunned I left nothing to my loved ones but music
Muses abandon me while choosing family over continued support
For my intuitive thought, who would’ve thought? I couldn't have thunk it
The worst thing I ever did to another person in this world is nothing
Only a few can claim that’s what I did when I could have done otherwise
Every single last one of them something-for-nothing types
Made me pay the price at any cost, I’ve got buyer’s remorse
How many toxins will the doctors find inside this corpse?
Suicidal watch -- it’s diamond studded
It tells me when my time’s up, I try to keep my eyes from it
It’s so swag, I flash it at the fashion shows
It walks with a limp it’s so pimp, and it smacks the hoes
Rappers used to brag about intelligence, it made me want to be smarter and I harbor no regrets. Whether it sells or not is irrelevant
I would have sold coke if making dough was the sole motive
It wasn’t, but fuck being a broke poet
With unpaid debts, begging friends for loose ends
If your so-called talent only results in loan extensions
There’s no defenses, or buyouts, you don’t get a per diem for good intentions
Do you on the side now
I promise that a job doesn't define you as a person
If your words don’t carry weight, it’s not the world's burden
And in no certain terms am I suggesting that you shouldn’t set fire to the stage and let the curtains burn
Just be aware of the exits
Keep in mind that the closest one might be behind you, the entrance
I've been eyeing it myself in the event that I can’t live better as an honest rapper
Without my past self being my benefactor

I set it up, you knocked it down
I set it up, you knocked it down
I set it up, you knocked it down
I set it up, you knocked it down
You laid the foundation, I built this house

Gambled away my better half in hopes of doubling up
The dealer said, ""double or nothing."" I laughed. I was shit out of luck
But what have I got to lose? At least I’m whole now
Half man, half clone, the bad composite sketch of a one-hundred percent asshole
But it wasn’t without help, many people did their part
To make me take the time to Frankenstein was ripped apart
And put it together again, all the king’s horses and all the king’s men
Couldn’t admit that this was a predicament they put me in
You want a piece of this? Welcome to the eggshells
Come barefoot and pregnant to my kitchen, y’all can help yourselves
To the feast and tippy-toe away if you can’t take the heat, or over-used clichés
Back in the days I’d leave you heartbroken
These days I simply reach into your chest and tear those scars open
Evaluate appreciation, write you off for tax purposes
I’d rather be homeless than settle in that worthless nest",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-the-set-up-lyrics
Black Out on White Night,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"""It was too good to last, he thought. Might as well have been a dream, he thought.""
The lights are out, the phones are dead
And I'm the only thing that's running in this city
Except for the clouds and man, they're coming down
If I knew my way around, I wouldn't feel so dizzy
Where's the telly? Nobody can tell me
I don't speak a lick of that language and got a slippery memory
If I spelled it all out on my arm, only if
But I didn't, so I think, ""Get a grip, kid, deal with it""
Baby's waiting for a ring and won't settle for the substitute excuse that's forming
I've got a complicated case of escapism
For her, I tried to rewire my nature
, too tired to wake her up
Out of that artificial calm she was on
A drug-induced future that slipped out of her palms
Seductive rain dancer, she thinks I'm waterproof
Like Superman doesn't need a roof over his head
When I come home to roost I'll need truth to hold in bed
But I'm seeking salvation in a booth, and the phones are dead
And the lights are out
And I'm the only thing that's living in this ghost town
Except for the clouds and man, they're coming down
If I knew my way around by now, I'd be bound for home
Black out on white night in Rome
Black out on white night in Rome

I know that I'm in love, but I know I'm out of touch
And I know that I get dumb when I can sense something's up
And then I bottom out, European tailspin
Scrawling messages out on my pale skin in hopes they get mailed in
Before the ink poisoning takes effect
And it gets smudged 'cause I budge before letting paint set
I get judged by the ones who have shelter and rain checks
While I trudge through the mud 'cause this foreign terrain's wet
Regain consciousness, then lose common sense
The ominous, dark skies that lie between me and Providence are signs
The obvious answer isn't standing on your face with stilettos on
If you pop the question wrong
Every song's a post afterthought, I won't grab the chalk to outline my body of work
Toe tags get caught in my teeth 'cause my foot is in my mouth
And the spurs are in my words, so my tongue can't dismount
Even after our rapport had fully run its course
Couldn't figure out the most heroic time to jump from the horse
And place this old hat for the last time on the coat rack
But I'd donate all of my earnings from the race just to know that
Resisting urges to go back and get it later
Like the milk would unsour itself in the refrigerator
A wet boy in a dry, dry state
On an old country road where tradition has a blind date
I'll make it dance on its own grave tonight
With a change of direction by the pale moonlight
And if it needs theme music, I'll break out the bagpipes
And play a tune you ghostwrote me in a past life that goes like ...

And you just act confused by the way I choose to fuck with a double helix
Cuddle with me quick, get befuddled and sea sick

It's melting and releasing toxic fumes
Covered by lots of perfume, never coming out of my closet of costumes
Cartoon versions of myself get drawn out
After that occurs, time gets consumed
I'm in the dressing room with the caricatures
Until my head is cured I'm heading for pedicures and manicures
Man, if your not damn sure of whether or not

An illusion specialist turning tricks who could never diss
The one the wake up next to 
even if it's not the one they went to bed with
Breakfast at Tiffany's
, skip lunch, make sure the dinner table is candle lit
I squish my feet until they crunch, but I'm unable to make these sandals fit
I can't just sit I need to MOVE and power walk, because Oprah said it
And I won't forget it, she does it during the opening credits
I'm so synthetic
I like the smell of coke, get it? I powder my nose
Power to hoes who pound on a hose while playing in a pound of snow
I'm getting snow plowed, I KNOW
It's time to fuck a guy now
I just applied blush and look surprised
But it's the way I plucked my eyebrows
Time out, I'm in a tanning booth... reading Danielle Steel
And I'm planting banana peels beneath every damn man's heel
Waiting for them to fall for my sad trick I stop, drop and kneel
With a little touch of magic, I'll let David cop a feel
I'm not real, but I've got FEELINGS...
Except in my nipples because of the breast implants
To have my chest enhanced I pant in dresses but never dress in pants
A club hopping strobe light honey...addicted to wrinkle cream
Sipping on Listerine, Mr. Clean don't like the smell of nicotine
Smoke and Mirrors
So sophisticated
So cool
I AM..
Dirtyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-smoke-and-mirrors-lyrics
Clickety Clack,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"Death be not proud, though some have called thee
Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow
Die not, poore death, nor canst thou kill mee

Clickety clack, clickety clack
Gather my things, and I quickly attack
Sword in my sheath, knife in my back
Keep enemies closer than where friends are at
Rose in my mouth, the petals are black
One armored suit, the metal's intact
Come fully strapped with a skull wooly hat
Just picture that, clickety clack
Now I find my location and unfold a map
My index inspects it and follows the path
My horse is on loan, and I borrowed a staff
From some mystical wizard, I will give it back
But I'm off to the races, my face has got cracks
Worn out and weathered like a red leather mask
I've been through the storm, future, present and past
Light as a feather, swift as a cat
Cold as a rock, you know not what you nicked from my sack
Little bastard, you'll get skinned for that
And you'll swim with the fishes once I finish this task
No strings attached, clickety clack

Kicked myself in the ass for not bringing my axe
But I've got the flash paper and one single match
Light won't escape me, a fire will catch
You'll beg and you'll plead, you'll scream and you'll scratch
But nothing can save you, you need to relax
I'll keep you alive for a while, feed you scraps
Love you like you deserve love, with some smacks
A kick and a slap, clickety clack
It's no longer personal, I'm simply detached
From what's hurtful, I need to keep my business exact
Separate beings, I can see our differences are vast
And I can't bridge the gap, clickety clack
Built a rickety raft out of twigs and some grass
And I made it to shore just before it collapsed
Salute to this mission, take swigs from your flask
Tilt your glass, pick your poison, I'm poised to be fast
On your scent, picked it up just by sniffin' the tracks
Kept my ear to the ground and heard snickers and laughs
Adding insult to injury for your criminal acts
Now the cost of your freedom is a liberty tax

You should have known better than to be mingling with rats
Got a lead to your shack from some gypsies in the trash
Cryptic interactions, I asked them to stick to facts
Made a trade and gave them everything that I packed
Now there's a brick through your window, kid, sift through the glass
Notice the note in which the brick was wrapped
Explaining that I know how you're quick to the dash
But it won't be very long before you slip in my trap
Like a moth to the flame with its wings in the wax
It's hard to escape with your limbs in a cast
Your heart will deflate when your wrists both get slashed
And gradually I snap these synapses in half
Magnificent crescendo, the cymbals all crash
You'll pay for your deeds, but we don't accept cash
We will mix and match this for that, tit for tat
Gonna get it, get it back, gonna getcha getcha back",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-clickety-clack-lyrics
I Was Zero,LI(F)E,2010.0,"If it wasn't for the bass, I wouldn't need these hearing aids
If it wasn't for mistakes, I probably wouldn't be here today
10 years ago I was 22
20 years ago I was 12
30 years ago I was 2
But when I came out my momma I was zero
When I came out my momma I was zero. (x3)
I was zero when I came out my momma, and now everybody knows
In the before life, I was undead
I was home schooled, there were no rules
But I gave it all up, just for the chance to go public
A celestial scarecrow dancing with the puppets
A tug in my gut, I'm carrying the world in my stomach
I'm a surrogate mother-fucker the girls love it
Birth the suffix and cut the visible string
Control's much more than a physical thing
I was born into it, and before I knew it
I saw the students of poor gettin' hauled off to war
The law of Judas in the land of the king's tax
Partaking the Eucharist, then demand your kick-backs
Spiritual wrist slap, please pass the sacrament
Ask if big bad black Jesus was African
Selling a click track, call it a soul-clap
It's all in how you package it
The power of a magic trick
Immaculate concepts, lost in the land of the cross
I'm standing off with a man of the cloth
He knows the ins and out's and all I wants the outs
Hes selling real estate for some place in the clouds
But I'm not investing in intellectual property
Inventing gender-bending technology
Because maybe everybody needs to just become a sexual oddity
Leaving birth to the test tubes and death to the lottery
There's no one stopping me, I've gotta be self-regulating
Wealth is escalating, but my poverty was entertaining
I'm debating, the value of a caste system
I'm cash backed for wars and wars funded by my tax income
I find my part of the problem in part of me
There's always been a difference between what I am and what I wanna be
It's either Jihadist freak or Jesus scenester
I heard god is cumming and shes a screamer
I couldn't understand what she was telling me
Why everyone thinks that they're their own worst enemy
I followed the manual and I swallowed the skeleton key
And it unlocked the hell in me
(So this is my gift to god!) Rippin' at my dick like a tourniquet, syphilis!
(This is my gift to god!) I'm jumpin' out the cake, naked with a shank
(This is my gift to god!) Unwrap the package confetti made of maggots
(This is my gift) You call that talent? here's your image back, you can have it
10 years ago I was 22
20 years ago I was 12
30 years ago I was 2
When I came out my momma I was zero. (x4)

Hoofprints in the Sand,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"I've seen a monkey evolve into a man
I've seen a man devolve into a monkey
I've seen a junkie redeem himself with help
I've seen a wealthy man melt into the snow and blow his credit on a decongestant
The dyslexics breathe easy
The people in the top tax bracket just keep looking for freebies
Thumbing their noses at those in need of handouts
I'm talkin' panhandlers with secondhand clothes, living hand to mouth
Camping out on Capitol Hill
The fat cats are still insisting reparations be a jagged little pill
Today there's free vaccinations at the walk-in clinic
If you're lucky, you won't just be a guinea pig
Call me a cynic
I find it interesting how certain epidemics spread
More specifically - where they don't and who isn't affected
Yeah, I'm infected with a curious nature
The welcome mat said, ""God bless this home,"" not ""God damn thy neighbor""
They can repeat history but can't recycle paper
They don't see the forest or the trees, just skyscrapers
Towers of Babel in a town full of cattle
When I question brand loyalty, the crowd is bedazzled
But I'll never be hoodwinked, I'm mindful of the footprints
The shape of the hoof, the way the path in the wood splits
The author of the book, the origin of the crucifix
The waitress looking for tips and the place where the cook spits
This is where I was when the bomb dropped
Hiding from the uninvited onslaught
I've seen people who don't believe in sleep count sheep
With calculators that double as alarm clocks
From Noah's Ark all the way to 
Rosa Parks
To black folk pushing white agendas inside of an office with flow charts
Technology ain't shit, we feed off the fruit
When I stuff leaves of absence in my briefcase, follow suit
Spill the liquid from your double fisted escapade
Kill kids with the drunken misfits in your Escalade
It's gruel for the food fight and foreign aid
Bream 'em down and build 'em back up with what you throw away
Administering band aids on amputated limbs
Kissing 'em with air raids, and your lips gave 'em infections
Too many closed doors led to back drafts
Now the spring edition of fashion catalogues feature gasmasks
How becoming on these lanky models
They can't look truth in the mirror without a pair of safety goggles
Hold the bobble head, insert the feeding tube
Even if they stop breathing, make sure they keep eating food
Do the Schiavo
Mouth opened wide like a perverse psycho circus side show
Forgive me not, my patterns stay impartial to apologies
Despite a polite side of mine that says, ""I'm so sorry""
Adding flame infinitum for your eternal fuel tank
My higher power doesn't need to be thanked
Thanks anyway, that's from him to me to you
I don't mind being the middle man, someday I might need one, too
I'm at the fire
Where are you?
I'm at the fire
Where the hell are you?
I've seen a man devolve into a monkey
I've seen a monkey evolve into a man
I've seen it all, upside down, in-between, inside out
It's neither here nor there, hoofprints in the sand
I've fallen head first into the pit of my stomach
Taught to trust my gut, got no trust in the gutless
Save some hope for the hopeless, but I won't show it
Shoot my load in an opus, now it's an open casket
Going to Hades in a hand basket
Holding onto a dream, but lately we can't grasp it
There's been too much murder and not enough martyr
Why is it no one else wants to impress Jodie Foster?

I'm at the fire
We're at the fire
Where are you? Where are you?
You can't have revolution without evolution, huh?
You can't have evolution without velution, huh?
You can't have velution without elution, huh?
You can't have elution without lution, huh?

You can't have ution without tion, huh?
You can't have tion without ion, huh?
You can't have ion without on, huh?
You can't have on without n, huh?
Seriously I know that you pray when the chips are down
But act different when there are atheists around
Have suspicions that make you think you'll drown
All alone in the middle of a crowd
I'd be a liar if I said I never had to beg
Doubled over with my knees bent touching my head
Stuck in a bed, dealing with all of these evil visions
Running from the dead in a fetal position
Needing assistance from a nurse
She said, ""Tell me where it hurts""
These words are gonna make my belly burst
So I mentally revert to all the enemies I've cursed
Running through my memories in reverse
I said bring that beat back, man, bring that beat back
A flash ain't enough time for me to recap
I'm a bastard sometimes, don't think I don't see that
Laughing at the dumb, blind, the deaf to the knee slaps
Cracking punch lines for the sake of some green stacks
Passion for the rhyme can be cheapened by feedback
I shut my eyes and proceed to go dream catch
But a troubled mind can't seem to fall asleep fast
I cut my ties like the way that a fiend acts
Go into overdrive and get caught in a speed trap",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-hoofprints-in-the-sand-lyrics
Diamonds and Pearls,LI(F)E,2010.0,"Surprising the world
With diamonds and pearls
But a song about a girl
Ain't really about a girl
Got a two-way vanity mirror
I'm an Amity villain
With a Peeping Tom complex
You're just a soul collector
You keep putting 'em in a trash bag
You push 'em in a shopping cart
Go and act sad
When there's none left, to collect
So you go on, and you make more
But wait...what'd you lose them to the state for?
The next time you see me
It'll be through plexiglass
There ain't no bail-outs in this jail house
Ain't no more petty cash
Easy come, easy go
A penny saved, a penny earned
And I've learned life is cliché
One of these days you get what you deserve
Surprising the world!
With diamonds and pearls
But a song about a girl
Ain't really about a girl
Got a 2-way vanity mirror
Firing a blind eye, I turn
From an 800-pound gorilla
In the midst of misdirected anger
False blood, it can run thinner than icy water
Watch the fang-banger
Flirt with the Death-star
I cried by your bedside
Decided right then and there to pretend you were alive
Maybe
Baby lie to me
Invade my privacy
Have the decency to say ""bye"", after taking the pride
Domestic piracy
You ran out of fam to plunder
And launch pads to crash
So when you're done playing dumb, empty the trash
We're looking for our lives back
We wish we could have saved yours
There's nothing we can buy back
'Cause everything was paid off
I found you in a pawn shop
You were stuck behind a glass case
I watched as the cost dropped
Puppy dog, sad face
Put a down payment on my meal plan
Just to see your shit-eating grin
Save the frown for when you need to shed your skin
Sell empty shells of yourself
The layers are coming off
Economic fail
Professional victim on sale, cutting costs
Charity case, don't ask me to donate
You axe-murdered your soul mate
My back's hurting from an tax burden
Pull your own weight
A punching bag for hire
Every minute there's a sucker bet
So what's the over and under you'll rise up from the debt?
With the complexion of a ghost
The resurrection was a hoax
But 2000 years later, it's like
Nobody knows
When you think you're slick enough
To turn a trick and spin the story
Just 'cause Jesus is your fair-weather pimp
And you caught me
Praying with my fingers crossed
So I shuffled up the deck
Is this the card that you picked?
Well if not, how about this?
Missionary ain’t a job, it’s a position
So assume it
The victimless crime watch-dog has a owner
That’s abusive
Now isn’t that ironic?
With one hand in my pocket
And the other choking out your street corner prophet
Uncrossed my fingers and said look at me when I’m talking dear
I ain’t mad at you
And that’s the only miracle here
I ain’t mad at you
I’m surprising the world
With diamonds and pearls

Ain't really about a girl",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-diamonds-and-pearls-lyrics
Underground For Dummies,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"And you'll know it was me by the trail of demos
Spare me the details, e-mails, memos
Dookie-gold chain letter to whom it may concern
Put this around your neck until your hanging on my every word

Stalkin', walkin' in my big black boots
I'm the DIY artist with thick grass roots
Had a couple managers as a youth
I was too young to know better but I was like
""What does a manager do?""
Now one of them he saw dollar signs in my skin color
The other, he said to keep it undercover
Post-VIP Posse, pre-Internet Nazi era
Powers of suggestion suggested I be what I'm not and that's not me ever
From La Cienega to Meadowbrook Drive
Never looked surprised
Cut to the chase with metal hooks and knives
Now it's battle time, I stepped in the arena
Thirteen-year-old gladiator freak
 with a fever for the flavor of a fight on the mic
Follow the leader
Mistachuck was the surrogate father
KRS-One, the teacher
There I was, sneaking into clubs
Beating emcees to the punch over instrumentals dubbed
From tape deck to tape deck
Pause tape mix at breakneck speed
The only whitey in sight
That doesnt make me realer than you, or faker than you
But I'm authentic, forget it
Started breaking rules
Ten years later still hadn't stopped
Won the biggest battle in a Metallica shirt before the album dropped
A week later, smashed the trophy at a show
It was taking up the space that I needed to grow

Pop pop goes the weasel (The weasel)
Drop drop goes the easel (The easel)
This is hip hop for the people
Stop calling it emo (Waah)

I know a kid who thinks he's hip hop cause he buys it
I know a kid who thinks he's hip hop cause he never buys shit
Underground or mainstream
Some are bound to change schemes
Y'all weren't doin this dirt
When Jeru came clean
Before the Freddie Foxxx conflict with DMX
Around the time Jay-Z and Nas's girl had sex
I used to wake up every morning on a hard wooden floor
Living in Brooklyn with a car I couldn't afford
And if I wasn't hanging out in front of Fat Beats records
I was in the factory mailing out my 12 inches
Nowadays the DJs don't even spin wax
So fuck a promo copy, buddy, you can download the track
Seratooo promo
 sexual laptop
A hollow existence in a bottle
Ya' sip sip and swallow
I tripped quick then followed a path that made sense
Started out with a live band then worked with turntablists
Now I strike the match with the back of my front teeth
And light up the stage with just speech
(Aaagghh, doesn't matter, doesn't matter!)
I remember the days Ken and Dave let me crash on their couch
And I saved what I could and put the cash in my mouth
When I played in my hood I had a fraction of outs
'Til Atmosphere put me on
 and now I'm packin' the house
Since the mid-80's this has been a game of cat and mouse
It's funny hearing all the shit these rappers brag about
Knowing all of them are walkin around with massive doubts
Talking 'bout it's only status and platinum plaques that count

Pop pop goes the weasel (The weasel)
Drop drop goes the easel (The easel)
This is hip hop for the people (The people)
Stop calling it emo (Raah!)

Irony is dead, it's so motherfucking dead, I was there by it's deathbed
And the last words that it said
Was ""Whiiiiite booyyyy!""

I'm Still Sick with an independent record label
I built quick just when I got Sick of Waiting Tables
Then in the blink of an eye I waged war
As a known unsoldier with a soul you can't pay for
I ran a business on my own two legs
Known to beg if I needed to with homegrown bootlegs
I cut and pasted images of my face
Photo-copied then sloppily placed 'em in a case 
(Strange Famous!)
I stayed True when School was in Session
Went to college to buy time, that shit was expensive
So I shamelessly self-promoted
The radio station would open doors and opportunities
Eventually made it to Oakland
Where Anticon. accepted me with open hands
Journals got personal on a one-dollar advance
 
(Non-profits!)
Had a hope that a UK label smashed
So I crossed out my eyes
 
and signed to Epitaph
This is the hustle of an emcee
The Distrust is Healthy
In a dirty industry where the promises are empty
I'm more honest than friendly
More handsome than sexy
Let me bring you up to speed, Humans do a Dance that's Deadly

Pop pop goes the weasel (The weasel)
Drop drop goes the easel (The easel)

Love the life that you live if it gives love back
You ain't gotta stay together for the kids
If you want to disappear don't announce it
Vanish in thin air and bounce quick
Fix the cowlick slick your hair back
Ride the rim bareback you stared at
Lady Godiva might have been an exhibitionist
I'm not here to judge voyeuristic fetishes
If nobody looked its a closed book
You could put your hang-ups on a coat hook
I'm from a puritanical land where they burn witches
I'm the result of a welfare running up your sickness
Cure never came Jesus never helped
We were all to blame god beat us with a belt
If I heard your name I'd retreat into myself
I won't hurt your name I'll keep it to myself with


No legacy to claim no enemies to squelch
No chemical imbalance that could remedy yourself
Pedestals for the parent's medicine is on the shelf
Put the trophy in the spotlight watch as it melts
Metal would've survived plastic is cheaper
Ran into the fire she asked me to leave her
I did what I could with the wood and the flammables
Stood with the good little animals ran with the bulls
Soot on my hands that were full put the good book on the mantle
Burn baby burn you could serve as a candle
Last thing I heard was her on the piano
Last thing I saw was her being herself
By beating herself to see if it could help
If I heard your name I'd retreat into myself

Call Me Francois,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"""Today, my mother killed me""
If I'm alive by the time you find this, it's a miracle
What else can be said, a vision quest with infrared
I'm at a dead end, I bled slow
From my chest, held my breath and did my mess and never let go
I lived a good life, I never had half-compromise a thing
And if I couldn't write, I'd think of other ways to optimize my living
No wife, no kids, no anchors
Hand over fist to withhold this info from the bankers
Don't know my neighbors, didn't take a village to raise me
Small-town mentality types thinkin I'm crazy
I ain't as weird as they paint me
Off color, I'm more gutter, punk, and ritzy
More glitz and glamour than others
Motherfuckers left me lonely in this designated corner
Had a couple walls that build upon, they made me a performer
Now shade me from the warmer weather
Save me from the slaughterhouse
That creeps between the pages where I try to hide my awful mouth
Speak discretely to the sheets that seem to be hollow
Punched a ladder full of holes, just for my swollen feet to follow
Support me all you want, don't let me drop a field of land
I'm not going to stop until God is my ceilin fan
Spare the lamb, save me from my former-self
That creeps between the pages as the line across and locks my self
Now this is my box, these are my walls
This is when time stops and I'm all that there ever was
And I'm all there ever is and I'm all that there ever will be
A freeze frame pine box soliloquy... Call me FRANCOIS
(Hook)
Call Me Francois (call call call me francois)
(Call call call me francois)
Take what you can; leave what you must
Because y'all comin with us, (motherfucker you comin with us)
Fill your bags with the rags that you wear and their necessities
Along with the dog-tags and family recipes
Rest in peace, if you arrest the pace, movin haste
God-speed you black empress, get dressed, we're late
She painted my head orange, carved my face with her tongue
Emptied out my insides and lit the candle behind my eyes
Had the strike of twelve to midnight, winter queen
Left with my life rival in a white limousine
When he made her dress twirl, it looked like a mushroom cloud
Everybody ducked down except for me, that's my destiny
He used a broken condom as a corsage
I watched him push the rusty pin through her prom dress into her heart
Kill me already; fill me with confetti
Crush me up and sprinkle me over their wedding and her pregnant belly
I wasn't ready to suppress these memories, undress the mammaries
Forget the family, streamline the enemy, design the penalty
Cruel and unusual, commit the felony, unfit for prison duty
No man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK STAR!
No man's an Island, except for Island man; he's a ROCK!

Threewrite,Sickly Business,UnKnown,"This is to the (uh-uh) intertwined souls
The hands I've been trying to hold
This is to the (uh-uh) love that I lost
And all the troubling thoughts of how I got double-crossed
And this is to the (uh-uh) divorce I was forced to settle with
And the remorse I fought off with metal fists
And this is to the (uh-uh) wet, watery kiss I left you with
On your porch as I watched your trembling lips
This is to the... memory of our early years
The first girl I shared feelings with
And it's the realest thing I'd experienced in my short existence
And I ain't afraid to admit
Cause love is one of the things that doesnt come with an age limit
Now does it? In fact I'mma have to say I'm more keen to feel such things
Hopeless things I'd lost in a smokescreen of meaningless fucking
Touching without touching, candles in the dark
Casting shadows on our parents battles, this is for the romantics at heart
It wasn't too long before I held you more then my pen
When I wasn't writing songs, it was something like
""Forever and always, whenever those songs play...""
I remember empty hallways
Or your image that descended from the top floor became an echo
I paid the price for those hard things, and couldn't afford to let go
From a passive debt, I'm past regret
Did you know I dreamt about you before we met?
Remembering our first kiss, and it hadn’t even happened yet
Recollecting your scent, and I wasn't even given the chance to forget
I guess that's the magic of it
Now every rehashed subject's displaying what I wrote
On cafe napkins to the public
To get it over and done with, closure hath cometh
My shoulders are plummeted from holding these buckets
Hold your laughs till I go back to the tunnels of Paris
Where I wrote half of these paragraphs... but fuck it
This is to my ten year story, in another decade
You better be better prepared for me
In the first four years, you were all ears
Then for the next six, you left me for the next exit
With depth to my message
So that began my affair with the world abroad
Behind the curtain with the other hurtful girls I explored
Until I became the monster, turning to the words that I record
Pardon me, if you heard it all before
""I didn't shake you to hurt you""
When you landed on the floor
In a room of naked virtues
I closed my eyes to cancel what I saw
Your hand made the first move to the handle of the drawer
Where the frail girl couldn't think to live
""I didn't shake you to hurt you""
I never planned it before
I can't shake off your perfume, can't wash my hands no more
And I'm breaking my curfew, but I can't walk
I'm standing at the door, I hear the wailing of a little kid
...and the failure of innocence
His compromise eyeing the side of the kitchen sink
What'you think, I just let you cut you, cut me-- cut the bullshit
Damn, I love the hugs enough to tolerate
The way we made each other crazy, making it so tough to operate
Productively, my self esteem didn't help when I felt ugly
And I figured that's the reason why you wouldn't touch me
My ego does bleed, I shouldn't have let you test it
And let your arms free to follow up with your domestic slip up
Love is a battlefield so lick your shots quick
While I lick my wounds and then resume as an obvious target
Infatuations with the past protect my Purple Heart with
A faded picture I had in my shirt pocket
I'm going out with a bang..
In a blaze of glory holes, the anti-hero
I don't care how many ways the story's told
Be careful when these doolies play like drums
And watch what you foolishly say because my uzi weighs a ton
This is to the sleepless evenings that I spent next to grave stones
Hoping someone from beyond would grab my arm and take me home
I hadn't accepted I'd have to make it alone
After feeding everything I had into a payphone
And this is to the rain..
I felt like it was made of spit
My parade was an unbreakable chain of Gabe's trumpets
Save the buckets even though they weighed down my walking
You don't know the height of the steak you place your fork in
You look old (that's what you said)
I feel old (that's what I said)
I been through a lot since you been gone, dead, born again
Torn to shreads over girls who were porcelain
The cry-baby dolls, when we were allowed to talk again
I stopped accepting break-up calls (that ring true)
I hate the way I fall for everything you do
Our fate is flawed, that's why I make these break-up songs to sing to you
Music is my only psychiatric drug
And you're a pill in human form I'd like to hide under my tongue
Kiss the foot that couldn't fit into the slipper of my mouth
The denizen in your house begging for the benefit of your doubts
When I got kicked out, I played the faithful puppy dog
Loyal to the love alost, sitting at your fucking door in utter disbelief
I sucked all of the skin off of my teeth
You pulled away, you let me choke on your invisible leash
You can find me hiding these screams behind my eyelids
She blinded me (she blinded me) with silence..
So my air-mail lips blew her a fairwell kiss
Slinking over the sink, where all the hair gel drips
Stairwells dip deep into her mouth where I found a cycle
And ever since then, I've been on a downward spiral
This round is final, it's time to recover
Because it's a porch that some dogs choose to die under
The first song was a breakdown, I apologize in round two
This version I'm certain, this shit ain't even about you
It's the threewrite..",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-threewrite-lyrics
Rewrite,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"This is to the woman who I loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe
Got divorced when it wasn't forced
Cause single thoughts of being double-crossed
Till there's no love lost
I can't even start this
She said forever..
This is the rewrite.. this is the rewrite
Yo, check this out!
This to the woman who I used to respect
Now I call her a bitch cause I'm constantly upset
So this is to the +bitch+ who cut communication
Caught in a relation
Selfishness? Best in the nation
All I ever needed was a hug
To wrap my loving arms around you, you blew it
Off with a shrug
So all I ever wanted was a hand to hold
I ain't the man to scold
Your plan is cold but god damn its old
It's about time get inside of my head while I'm out my mind
As I scream cry yell shout and whine
All I ever asked for
Was an ear to hear me
What you really have to wear a
Mask for?
You straight shattered my glass jaw
Now I'm picking up the pieces of my past what you last saw
But see this, needless to say, you went astray
All people ever hear Paul say is
I don't give a damn, for real, I don't care
Let's pull the hair from myself and try to make things clear
Yeah, I don't give a FUCK for real I don't FUCKING CARE
That's all I hear..
The pain stops with the end of raindrops
But this cloudy weather just reminds me of the time we spent together
And how you left forever like that with a snap of fingers
Pain lingers, so this is to the
Woman who I made my family
Now I call her a bitch just to save my sanity
So this is to that +bitch+ who I thought would be right here
She's just a monster in my reoccurring nightmare
Now when my grandfather died, you weren't there for me
When my grandmama died, you weren't there for me
When my natural dad died, you weren't there for me
You saw me and just ignored me like ""Sorry end of the story""
My family's dropping like flies ???
Somehow I got to rise
But nobody's by my side, can't look straight into my eye
Nobody's by my side, can't look straight into my eyes
My fist grabs air, I stare in through the lies
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me this is the things that you showed me
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me, never thought that you'd turn phony
But you did, now I'm going all out kid
And I got mad hate to deal with
Just ask ???
I'm having trouble letting anyone get close to me
And that's a major
Problem because that's not the way it's supposed to be
Supposedly, I should keep my composure
Right now, I'm like ""wow"", it's time for me to seek closure
Mental pictures are destroyed - overexposure
Ever get that feeling that nobody really knows ya?
This is to the woman who I called my best friend
Now I call her bitch, because she made the switch to that +bitch+
Who I shouldn't disrespect
So now I call her woman just to keep myself in check

Polterzeitgeist,LI(F)E,2010,"While you're going around trying to keep people outta hell
I'm going around trying to keep the hell out of people

Your evil sends chills through my bones and it flows through the back roads of my arteries
Genetic memory fights technology administered by moral midgets
There are picket signs in my eyes and when they strike you'll wanna talk business
Note to self, go for self, go for broke no one else ever showed you the ropes or helped
And what are they supposed to do?
Of course they gotta rebuild every wall that you broke on through
Drugs won't get my thoughts runnin'
I need em to make these thoughts stop comin'
Last night I had a dream I shot someone
When I awoke my hands were full of the fluid my heart's pumpin
I went to get it tested, the doctor was not so interested in analyzing the message
He had a pill, that if he issues out, he gets paid on the side
I got a lifetime supply

Maybe he's a ghost, and maybe I'm the host
The 
polterzeitgeist
 who knows the right price to pay the priest to release me from these ropes
Maybe I'm the ghost, and maybe he's the host
The polterzeitgeist who knows the right price to pay the priest to release me from these ropes

I fell into a Venus fly trap with a nicotine eye patch
Pirate of the ship sippin' Listerine nightcaps
Disguised her voice with the breath of a clean slate
Awake every morning to the death of my dream date
Selling sex to cheapskates with rusty blades
Fuck to forget and call it layaway
Got an addiction to thin ice
The whisper of windpipes
I'm master insight
This social costume is skin-tight
Nah, I don't believe in you
And you don't believe that I'm leaving you
As you shrink away to nothing in my rearview
Too close to call, too far to be hearing you
Singing my melody, I heard it subconsciously
When you spoke in your sleep it sounded like honesty
When you awoke you said it was not for me
I said, ""Oh, I know, obviously...""
You're not my Yoko so I cropped the photo and I rocked it solo
Now you gotsta go, GO!


Maybe you're a ghost and I'm the conduit
The common thread in every superficial compliment
The loose string in your moral fabric
Hole in your logic
Hopelessly romantic in Woonsocket
Leaving notes for the next to come
Written in blood from the wound that they'll exit from
I don't compose prose or sonnets
I just write like my life depends on it
Front like I'm agnostic
But I don't believe in you
You've got a transparent nature that I'm seeing through
Somebody spiked the punch that you beat me to
Sometimes I'm not even sure it's even you

Maybe you're a ghost, and maybe I'm the host

Nah, they can't win
Let me/Let's tell you again
Epic beard men!

Get mentally fit for that celestial fist bump
Roll with emcees who spit '70s Britpunk
Enemies get jumped, penalty stiff as fuck
Stuff a flaccid penis in your pistol pump
""Pump it up, homeboy, just don't stop!""
Some boys in blue are cool, but I trust no cops
Are they civilized, militarized, or just robots?
We've widened the divide between the knows and the know nots
Stay straight-faced or go pop some molly
But there ain't no party like a Botox party
I'm so hot tamale, so chilly chill today
You don't want your mommy to know what I really really say
What if you learned what I learned? I learned from her
Smoked too close to the bush and I burned my fur
I know the fables, you failed a course in physics
I don't understand shit unless of course I lived it
So let me live, Mama
Let me live, let me live, let me live, Mama
Let me live, let me live, let me live, Mama
As a hip-hopper without the stigma of stigmata
Save your earnings if you're fortunate to have some, sucker
They say they're fans but they never brought an album from you
That's all good and well, well, that's all well and good
Legacies are never set in stone when you're selling wood
What you think all this Axe is for?
You don't wanna bring these hungry lumberjacks to war
When we yell ""Timber!,"" take cover
Or start singing R 'n' B, motherfucker


Crawl out of the water with the skin of a shark
Stomp on a sandcastle and murder the life-guard
All my god-damn life had my hand around a mic
So whatever you could like, we already said it twice (twice)
Epic Beard Men, with some lather and a blade
Fuck battling, I'd rather take a layer off your face

I was made into a monster courtesy of a Sage
I was born for bad luck, Daddy drove a Mack truck
Ran with rat fuck kids who just trashed stuff
Oh you mad, huh? Then go and take a number
Or take a vacation while I work through the summer
It's Dolan, motherfucker! Run your fingers through the jungle
It's more than just the stubble, too pretty to be this humble
I'm picky with the drum loop, sickly with the one-two
God forbid you miss us in your city when we come through
Nahhh we ain't related, we just share the same mothers

Come Come Now,Still Sick... Urine Trouble,UnKnown,"Let me rub my back against the notches on your bedpost
Scratch these afterthoughts off my flesh and shed ghosts
My head's close to your closet door,
 
I've got the glass to my ear
My nose is in your business I smell something fishy here
I hear bones rattling.
 
Poems battling for space and time
Phones that'll ring
 
when I make judgment calls with pick-up lines
Sexual hang-ups leave me waiting nude and while alone
It just gets aggravating masturbating to a dial tone
I'm the home to run-away trains of thought
My one track mind
 
is a collision inter-course where victims cross
Bedroom eyes...Uncross their legs exposing inner thighs
I disrobe and show my most convincing disguise
I've lived so many lives each death has left my face scarred
Hid so many lies under my breath that I can't face God
Dig into my mind deep enough you'll find a graveyard
I get nervous bodies will resurface every time it rains hard
""Don't cry, girl."" Let me outline your short comings
While my world is full of them and they're all in the long runnings
It's all fun and games. It's all done in vain. It's all a fucking shame
I ain't the one but I'm the one to complain?

I'm the one to come home. Compare. Contrast
Come fast. Make love to the present, fuck the past
Make love to the present, fuck the past. Nothing lasts
Don't you dare worry about the morning aftermath (yeah!)

Don't you love how much you paid for your education? (yeah)
Don't you love your job and spending every day there? (yeah)
Don't you love your girl? You have such a healthy relationship. (yeah)
Don't you love having that break-up sex, that make-up sex? (yeah)

Taking an acid bath, pissing on the shower curtain
The gal just laughs and starts dissing my towel turban
I had to ask if she knew how to listen now I'm certain
Now my task is just to get up in her like I was a surgeon!
I'm a virgin who makes exceptions at sunset
My dirty skin gets cleansed by the summer sweat
""Self, have some respect! I don't need you new and clean
But I don't want the procedure routine!""
A screw machine! with a few bolts loose. Robot response touch tone
Hair trigger, happy-go-lucky emotion monger wants a love poem
Run home. Dip into your closet and jump bones
Your secret admirer's stuck higher up and he's unknown
Looking down on you. Can you bare the burden?
My ears are hurting. I found a few gears are turning
With squeaky wheels. They get the grease cause its a damn nuisance
Understand the blueprints for our mechanical movements
It never ran smooth since we abused the Earth
Grabbed a hand full of pubics and removed the turf
Refused its worth, we lose our shirts. She assumed the worst
And needed proof of birth? I'm leaving this universe
It seems doomed and cursed. See if you come first then come fast
Come here. Come back. Compare. Contrast
Complain. Constrain. Constantly ask
Complicated questions contain scientific answers in your flask
Condone. Condemn. Come home. Come friend
Confuse. Common issues. Condelude. Comprehend
Karma. Chameleon. Come again?
Continue to come in you. Come to daddy. Condescend
Come and bring us (Confidence). Cunnilingus (Compliments)
Come to think us went from guilty consciousness to common sense
Calm down. Complete. Compound. Come eat
Our Common ground meat from man-made concrete

Come to the street. Conquer the weak. Come to terms with coming last
Make love to the present, fuck the past
Make love to the present, fuck the past. Nothing lasts
Don't you dare worry about the morning aftermath. (yeah!)
Don't you wanna take a shower with me? Clean me up. (yeah)
Kill yourself...while you're still alive
(Kill yourself) while you're still alive while you're still alive. (3X)

See when you put a shell to your ear, it is not the sound of crashing waves
That you're hearing. It's the amplified current of your own bloodstream
It was your self-pulse that created that post-human illusion of me. Your
Tireless heart pumping out an ocean of lies and I foolishly tried filling
Impossible shoes resulting in my stumbling as I fell into the trap of making
A woman my element. Now I just can't get comfortable being out of you...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-come-come-now-lyrics
Good Fashion,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"Dark lenses, tint the windows that are under my eyelids
To hide from the light like I'm stuck in a fire pit
Burning up a sigh, with no desire to live through these lies
So I suffer in silence
Culture of violence, truth stuck behind my lips
Bound, gagged, and whipped, stripped, divided and split
Eatin' words with a forked tounge
And now the grumble of my stomache's got the thump of a war drum
A battle goin' on inside, nobody's safe from
Clowns are playing russian roulette with paint guns
They run in place, and they call it the human race
Losin' pace with that stupid look on their face, shootin' blanks
And all they ask is why I wear these glasses
And all I can tell them is hell, it's good fashion
All they ask is why I wear these glasses
And all I can tell them is, hell...
We're acting like men of steel, with a thin protective shield
Gathering the raw footage that can never make the final reel
So we cover up the stories that eyes tell, make way for what we take to the grave
It doesn't bind both souls, buried in a Faustian bargain bin
In the cemetary there's a joust between God and men
Talkin' loud, but ain't sayin' nothin, used to have daily discussions, I doubt we'll ever talk again
And all they ask is why I wear these glasses
And all I can tell them is hell, it's good fashion
All they ask is why I wear these glasses
And all I can tell them is, hell...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-good-fashion-lyrics
Eviction Notice,Personal Journals,2002.0,"Fuckin' doin' it
This song is called Eviction Notice, it's a 2-parter
It's about how drugs are the gateway to fun and flat laugh lines
There's effort in her smile and it shouldn't be that way
Her last days are being snuffed out in an ashtray, and that's pricely
Trying to intercept the passing away I've asked nicely
But I've learned not to feed the hand that bites me
This morning the cradle rocks the hand
As I bang on pots and pans
She's just playing in her warning labeled box again
She wants a man I can look up to, a role model to come through--
Don't bother unpacking your car...cinogen filled thrill sticks
This girl will spit fire
Got me doing pirouettes over her guilt trip wire
I still skip by a land mine or two, see I've learned the landscape
All the while practicing my firm handshake
Hair, trigger-finger itch to spark any conversation
Said explosive personalities don't part deadly confrontation
What happens in between her lips
She needs a fix more than she knows her friend's a bitch
And needs to go
There's a note on the door..
Eviction notice
""Listen, one of us is leaving, and when I say US I mean YOU...
YOU'RE leaving. (You're leaving... You're leaving.)""
I'm in the house y'all, I'm in the house y'all
And ain't no little piece of paper gonna kick me out y'all!
What?? I'm in the house, I'm in the house
And ain't no legal separation gonna kick my ass out
I'm in the house y'all, I'm in the house y'all
And ain't no new boyfriend gonna kick me out, y'all!
Fuck that, I'm in the house, I'm in the house
Ain't no snot-nosed brat gonna kick my ass out
Pick ME! Please leave me believe me
Please leave me believe me please
Please leave me believe me please leave me
Please believe me, leave me leave me..
This song is called Eviction Notice, it's a 2-parter
Basically it's about how sacrifice and vices will invite themselves
To an overstayed welcome at your haunted house parties
There's effort in her smile and it shouldn't be like that
Her final evenings have her drowning in a nightcap, and that's costly
Trying to keep her on the right track I ask softly
But she just says ""BACK OFF ME""
And I've learned to space her private respect
She breathes some room to need and every afternoon proceeds
To mix her liquid sitter while preparing baby food to feed
She wants I man I can look up to, a mentor-- Fuck you!
Get your things packed
Yes kids, the poison is the message in the bottle
Before the dawn she'll have to kill all fetal positions by ingesting a
Morning-after pill
Crawling fast until I get rewarded for how good I've behaved
While practicing my goodbye wave..
Should I stay? After planning my escape routes
And shouting out, ""Is there a lifeguard in the lighthouse?""
To the rescue bottle mouth-to-mouth between her lips she sips
She needs a fix more than she knows her friend's a bitch
And there's a note on the door..

Narcissist,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"I don't look at myself in the mirror because I'm a narcissist
I simply like to watch myself exist...
Now I'm in a fog and mist...
Now my reflection is anonymous
Ponder this!
I've seen a reflection of my soul in the store window
Caught in limbo 'cause I was dressed all in Timbo's
Having fantasies of playing Polo with Ralph Lauren on a Tommy Hill
And my paper thin spirit was still grieving from the Versace kill in Florida
Opened the door to the store and I walked down the corridor
To see they had a blow out sale on Nautica
I've always been a Lord of the button down Flies
Being they were half-priced, I pass 'em on by looking for Levis
But Guess what? All my favorite clothing lines and hip designs
Were being liquidized and it made me sick to my eyes
I don't understand, when I had no ends, the price was quick to rise
I'd buy a pair of trends even if it didn't fit my size
Purchase a surplus of fads from merchants whose ads
Made these cheap ass fabrics that were so worthless and sad
Just look priceless, they used unethical devices to attack my sense of
Self-worth during my prepubescent crisis
It fed into my insecurities, so instead of being righteous
I want everyone to see me like this
It's all about who looks the nicest
Ice is falling off my Rolie onto my body, shoot!
I hope to hell it doesn't melt and ruin my Armani suit
While I'm sweatin' this,some kid who doesn't got any loot
Is buying my necklace along with my same exact khakis and army boots
What?! This is blasphemous!
Since Adidas tried changing its logo
There ain't been nothing as wack as this
It's probably a stunt being pulled by Animal Rights activists
Because of all that Third World country garbage but I'm a pacifist
So while these monkeys sweat over my name brands that exchange hands
From enslaved lands, I wonder if I'm the same man
Without reward...for what I bought but CAN'T still afford
This is the type of self-realization that might have killed the Lord
I didn't mind working free as a walking billboard
But now I want my money back...as the ice spilled and poured
Onto the floor I did see a distorted reflection of my Nike hat
I don't know how others might react
For me it was an unsightly act that helped me get my psyche back
I stood 5 feet back, afraid that it might strike me like Shaclack clack!
Ya'll think I'm kidding? It's not big thing
What I seen made my heart hurt, stomach turn, throat burn, teeth cringe
Spine tingle, and ribs sting
I noticed that the swoosh symbol was nothing but a whip in mid-swing..
I don't look at myself in the mirror because I'm a narcissist
I simply like to watch myself exist...
I'm in a fog and mist...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-narcissist-lyrics

Cup of Tea,Personal Journals,2002.0,"Every midnight we sit at the coffee table and we share a cup of tea
He stays up with me and we discuss things
Most of the time he just listens
Other times offers suggestions or he just ignores my questions
It gets more depressing as time passes
Every night I ask this one question
And all he does is wipe his glasses
It's aggravating as hell
I'm just waiting to tell
Whether or not he can even remember the answer
Whether or not he's choosing not to tamper with his memory
Whether or not he can even fucking remember me
What a waste of time!
But every night it's that same damn routine
One green cup of tea
And me stuck all by myself once its empty
And then I'm off to bed with plenty of caffeine to keep me up and thinking
The cup I'm drinking from is never clean
I can't remember if it's a dream once I awake and I walk
From my messy bed and anticipate our next late night talk
(You don't scare me
Why are you still sitting here
I'm not afraid of you
You are not intimidating!
What is it that you want from me
I'm not leaving
I want to stay, I want to stay...)
Every midnight we sit at the coffee table and we share a cup of tea
He stays up with me and we discuss things
Most of the time he just listens
Other times offers suggestions with his awful expressions
Altered reflections
His whole aura is see-through
With more confessions, I don't want to leave you
This cup should be bottomless!
As my insecurities spill
I see his face fading away, I surely need a refill
I purposely keep still and don't move much
Except to wet my lips with sips
With every kiss of death I lose touch
I sip the tea carefully
Because its at the degree of separation
Tasting the forked tongue in bilingual conversation
Waiting for his answer still
And at any given chance I will
Sweet and Low my bitter past, let the cancer kill the small talk
Alright man, this bitter taste in my mouth needs to get washed out
Ghosts in this house don't have anything timely to talk about
The concept is dead, there's nothing death should interrupt

Stuck,Sickly Business,UnKnown,"You act smart, while I act dumb
But I know some that still lay under my thumb
See, we've got issues
So we swing our fists full
Whatever, tryna keep the temper down to the gristle
They like the small talk, as long as it's about you
They walk that walk, without knowing how to
I watch it all, and pretend that I'm above it
But the truth is, I see her I need it I love it

I'm stuck with random stray hairs, from ex-lovers
Entangled in each other's desire to stay here beyond their welcome
Sharing the same common problem
Blonde and brunette tightly knit
And I don't fit in with split ends
Didn't have to worry about them taking me from my dividends
Paid my dues spending time by myself
She was with her friends, mingling with single men
Say things like hitting skins to them
Thinking it's innocent but then giving me guilty grins
Swimming with filthy fins, knocking boots, kicking my shins
Shark infested water torture treatment get beat by the timbalands
Feet is shivering walking on cold rage
Roses lay on relationships, too impatient to die of old age

Yeah, remember when you knew you knew all the answers?
Well something shook until you thought you had the questions
For all the time and effort you've invested
I find it kind of funny that you haven't learned your lesson
Still guessin'
The whisper of the leaf, the rustle of the bitch
When there is no love, nothing makes you rich
So I give a shrug, and the eye muscle twitches
In replace of a hug and a lack of superstitions

Stop thinking you don't belong here
You are where you are cause you hardly move
The music is not gonna' stop
Take your eyes of the chair
Cause there's others that are under the same impression as you
How many seats will the rock bottom accommodate?
One too many people who share nothing but views
Misery is more than willing to keep company
With those who don't ever walk a mile in their own shoes

So now they swap souls
They got so fuckin' uninspired
They drive low under the fire of sky Gods
It got old and now they wanna go higher
But cops control every single empire with tripods

So video did kill the radio star
Now we're all so cute and drive brand new cars
We make music so you can lose your minds
We do the crimes, so you can do the times
Tell me who can get busy like this man
Well the truth is, damn near anyone can
So I'mma buy you some implants and a suntan
Let's follow the plan and get some fat off the land
Fuck this little rapper, treat me like a crook
Maybe if you knew me, you wouldn't sing my hook
You'd think I was so ugly, you'd be afraid to look
But maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get a chapter in your book
Doing fine, thanks for asking
Standing as the last man
Popping bubbles and aspirin
Ready, set, action
Remove your dress, so we can make a mess
And hit the world with a little bit of stress

Let's head talk these winds until they strengthen for getting footwork
Making power moves on ceilings with head spin
It unravels the bloody ground, revealing red sin
We created hierarchy, now there are no kings in heaven
Fatty acids added to the asthma medicine
Breathing heavy at the gates make them have to let us in
Like implying we've been trying our hardest
Using everyone elses' honest way of dying as an armrest
I ain't gonna promise, broken over dislocated kneecaps
And it's harmless jokes that provoke freak accidents
Laugh at that lapdancer who strips off confidence
I live off of hope, and Providence

Your communication tactics are all fucked up, don't blame me, I had nothing to do with this

You play the same damn records everyday
No wonder you believe you'll never get away
You wear the same pair of jeans you woke up in
Keep the music coming, keep the movements sudden
I watched you dance every street of this city
I feel no pity
You laid the carpet
You made the target by yourself, little help
Now loosen up the belt and straighten up the apartment
Finish that book that you never even started
Take a look at that face that hates to look back
Set the oven on bake, take a pan out the rack
Season up your past, put it in and cook that",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-stuck-lyrics
Ground Control,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"Sad Sad Monster. Turn those horns up
Burn the back roads. Find your way out
Troubled love life... give the gift of yourself...
To the dark

Ground control to lost soul...
Ground control to lost soul...
If you copy...
Come in lost soul
Come in lost soul
We lost contact
Abort Mission
We lost contact

Don't these dead streets back you into bad corners?
Curbs crumble once you park your ass on em
Parking meters overdue. Violation goes unnoticed
Out of all of those who tried to travel off road... you've come the closest
So I grant you this toast:
To all of those who showed promise and never made one that broke
I salute you. I never meant to lose you
But I know this road don't go where it used to
I've got a map that looks a lot like your veiny arms
It ain't to scale, but it details the name of this song
And this one is called ""Cancelled Flight Blues""
A manipulative twist I think that Manson might've used
But poor musicians come a dime a dozen
And you're the eggman, a flash in the pan, and your yolk is running
Who broke that hard outer covering?
Some chick in your mix you couldn't level with, headless horsemen?
Come the suffering... go the direction...
Following air currents, but it was my drift you were supposed to be catching
Fish nets collect dust in stagnant water
I haven't heard back from you since the gag order
Pussycat got your tongue?
Pick it up up up up up up up (end communication)

Bad, bad actor. Flip that script now. Come on!
You cock. Bust my shit! Woaaah!
You're a lint ball who moves on the whim of the wind
Confused flexible movement for freedom
If the walls you keep bouncing off of are closing in
Theres only so much time before your rhythm gets broken
I could hear it speeding up before we lost signal
It caused a ripple effect. Rings on the radar would intersect
Now your fingers are off limits;
I can't hold your hand longer than your attention span
The two way street we are supposed to meet on is just
A one-way dead end. You're some of my best friends
Press send. Where are the donuts you've been lost inside?
Tow trucks you've been forced to ride? Hold ups at the borderline?
Customs will confiscate costumes
Eat my dust and get exhausted, force-fed my car fumes
I can't afford the duty tax, so expensive
Come off your head trip and visit where your old friends live
You're sensitive like the time (critical!)
You swore to God on a lie and didn't die (you're invincible)
Kiss the pavement, make love while cars spin
Be careful when the unsafe sex parade comes a marchin'
They've got full body condoms to carry you off in
I wish I told you that while we were still talking

(This is paid for advertising
Free food for all)
Well it's a tangible death
And I can almost handle it
When it cancels my breath
Put your hand over my candle then rest
There's no pain in this fist release
Put my elbows on the window frame
Glass pressed against my cheeks
Everything I see is mine
I never look back
Couldn't ask the same of those I leave behind
The air bubbles rushin' towards the water surface
A clumsy stage hand makin' a grand exit
Caught in the curtains
A person should have pulled this rope long ago
'Fore the water hole froze over
I saw the snow
The best cue for rescue is a couple yanks
Press my luck, held my breath enough but then my stomach sank
Shoulda never been walkin' the plank
With cement shoes without a oxygen tank or wetsuit
Destitute conditions leave fishermen victims
Of circumstance
But you don't need a hook for the worms to dance
Off to the bathroom to sniff another line (sniff another line)
There's a big party goin' on and you're not invited (you're not invited)
Now I'm just howlin' at the moon sippin' its shine (sippin' its shine)
There's a huge rock hurlin' through space won't you help me light it
I'm playin' jump rope with my veins tonight
But you download but I pay the price
The DJ saved my life
Nothin can cut into my fun but the razor might
This song is brought to you courtesy
Of medicine prescriptions
Dead-again christians

And b-boys on acid

Black Sweatshirt,Personal Journals,2002.0,"Tonight I'm in the mood for some unscheduled affection
Spontaneous combustion...I'm playing with my fire inside
Burning my inner child blackened his skin to the tint of his sweatshirt
""Hey...when you play with the big boys, you get hurt!""
I used to suck my thumb while rubbing silk blankets across my cheek
Until my mom denied me access. I bawled for weeks
We don't speak to this day. I came to terms with my fear and loathing
Now I wear this clothing...like it's an extra layer of old skin
Afraid to shed...tears...in the fabric...from years that I've had it
Found abandoned on the stairs to the attic
Collecting runaway skin cells...absorbing memories
It's been to hell and back, dragged through the dirt and even worn by enemies
Born in the 70's of the 20th century
Making that distinction is for future reference...In case y'all remember me
And my genesis. What's most important is to remember this
Women and men are pissed. When they kiss they exchange spit that is venomous
Most of it is affection-less and the affects of this has us quick to clench a fist
Don't get fancy with your paintbrush when you reminisce
I'm sentimental and I miss what used to be close to me
Or maybe I've just got OCD and I can't break my old routines
Hopefully I reconcile with my inseparable...what lies inside from head to toes
Instead of symbolizing clothes...identifying with outside symbols...
Cut out the middle man...
But my woobie is in demand...
I'm feeling like a kid again
""It protected me from the wind, sea and sand
Sanity was saved from the crazy cemetery walks
And every awkward moment spent talking with the Boogie Man
Man...managed unconditional comfort. As I've come to understand...
The monsters are under my bed again...
The monsters are under my bed again.""

Lie Detector Test,A Healthy Distrust,2005.0,"Got a caveman banging on my back door
Got a hang man hanging on my front lawn
Got an old maid wasting away in the living room
Kids in the kitchen with their mouths full of silver spoons
Got a paper full of yellow journalism
A restaurant waiter selling me words of wisdom
The small town crier is chilling with the village idiots
The big city slickers are still busy building pyramids
Got a diploma but no wall to hang it
Tags on the bathroom stall to make me famous
A job description that don't fit the bill
A fatal femme fatale dressed to kill
Get me out of this, lie detector test

My breath is a microphone check: 1, 2, what is this?
(I wanna give a big special shout out to all the real people out there, keeping it real, because reality is worth maintaining, you know what I'm saying? keep it up)
In a world where these girl's got retro tattoos
And all I've got is a gut and Velcro black shoes
And elbows that move in a way that makes space
I'm looking at you (stay awake, stay awake)
Natural face affected by the chemical leaks
Grammatical mistakes in every sentence I speak
It doesn't matter, I make enough sense to seem deep
Now look at me (go to sleep, go to sleep)

Cause I've got some ins and I'm a bet all my winnings
If it hurts me more than it hurts you, then I won't hurt you
I've got more sense than virtue
I've got a curfew, it's 12 o'clock
After that I'll start trembling if I get fed hip-hop
Why? Cause I'm a G to the r-e-m-l-i-n

16 Years,LI(F)E,2010.0,"The sun flies through the sky, leaves darkness in its wake
And now I hear the hellhounds barking at the gate
To be honest, sometimes I don't want you to relate
This ain't up for discussion, it's not a topic for debate
Entrepeneurs, they want to bottle up the hate
And slap a label on the glass so hard that it'll break
If you break it, you buy it, and we sold it by the case
It's OK if you just try it, you can hold it to your face
How close can you get without touching it?
How far removed can you get from the public?
Can you keep a secret? If not, can you tie a slipknot?
Can you stand high up on this brick block?
Listen to the clock tick-tock and switch gears
It's been one, two, three, four, five, six years
Are they all dancing now? Are you joining the party?
Are just celebrating life just by destroying your body?
It's a part of your psyche I want to sight-see
I don't need you as a tour guide and I don't want you to like me
I was voted least likely--that's it, just least likely
So pardon me if I seem feisty
Bite my tongue like a bullet, take a pull from the peace pipe
Push past the low expectations of me each night
I leave light in my wake and I moonwalk across the floor
Until I hear the sex kittens all purring at the door
There's something outside that we all want
But inside, there's an ex who marks a soft spot
Till it rots and decays and then no one else cares
It's been seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve years
Now I sell pennies to the well-wishers
, I fish through the coinslots
I fall through a girl's bait, participate in boycotts
I demonstrate a demon's trade
 
with a face void of thoughts
If that don't launch a thousand ships, then that's a Helen of Troy's loss
There's nothing in this horse: it's hollow, it's empty, its entry will not be forced

Three Sheets to the Wind,LI(F)E,2010.0,"Had one too many one way conversations
With the licky-licky lord
'Till I grew a scissor tongue
And c-c-cut the cord
Put the phone on the floor
Detach the wires in my head
Took awhile to accept that that line was dead

Didn't never wanna not live forever 
Didn't never wanna not not wanna live

Nah, it didn't matter if the laughter didn't come after the bad joke
If i was down with the filthy rich or flat broke
Accepted by the Aryans or black folk
Cause i was carrying this weight until my back broke
Wasn't trying to be no hip hop god or raps G.O.A.T
Shootin' to be a rock star like its my last hope
Eyeballin' that pack of smokes, do me in!
Graduatin' on the crack coke, do me in!
Knocked of a paddle boat in the middle of the castle moat
Kings men are yelling GRAB THE ROPE!
Three sheets to the wind!
Three sheets to the wind!

I talk like a sailor, my mother is one
That's why i got this sixth sense of direction and my split tongue
Taught me how to go with the flow when the winds come
Curled up in a ball and tried to hide inside a kick drum
While the crew is gettin' piss drunk i had to purify my own and drink up
I had to save and conserve recycle my salty words to keep the meat on my bones all pres-s-s-served


It was a tug of war and we all fought together
'Till we went our own way when the c-c-c-cord was severed
The stormy weather would begin, we'd all succumb to this sin
Any bar within reach, Three sheets to the wind
From a back pedal the backstroke got traded in my life jacket for a mask and cloak
Three sheets to the wind
I had to go, watch the sail grab the rope
See shanty ending on a sad note
Three sheets to the wind
Malnutrition (Pull me in)
Bad Religion (Pull me in)
Fact or Fiction that's addiction

Narcissist (Non-Prophets 2002),The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"I don't look at myself in the mirror because I'm a narcissist
I simply like to watch myself exist...(HHHH)
Now I'm in a fog and mist...(HHHH)
Now my reflection is anonymous
Ponder this!
I've seen a reflection of my soul in the store window
Caught in limbo cause I was dressed all in Timbo's
Having fantasies of playing Polo with Ralph Lauren on a Tommy Hill
And my paper thin spirit was still grieving from the Versace kill in Florida
Opened the door to the store and I walked down the corridor
To see they had a blow out sale on Nautica
I've always been a Lord of the button down Flies?
Being they were half-priced, I pass 'em on by looking for Levis
But Guess what? All my favorite clothing lines and hip designs
Were being liquidized and it made me sick to my eyes
I don't understand...when I had no ends...the price was quick to rise
I'd buy a pair of trends even if they didn't fit my size
Purchase a surplus of fads from merchants whose ads
Made these cheap ass fabrics that were so worthless and sad
Just look priceless, they used unethical devices to attack my sense of
Self-worth during my prepubescent crisis
It fed into my insecurities, so instead of being righteous
I want everyone to see me like this
It's all about who looks the nicest
Ice is falling off my Rolie onto my body shoot!
I hope to hell it doesn't melt and ruin my Armani suit
While I'm sweatin' this,some kid who doesn't got any loot
Is buying my necklace along with my same exact khakis and army boots
What?! This is blasphemous!
Since Adidas tried changing its logo
There ain't been nothing as wack as this
It's probably a stunt being pulled by Animal Rights activists
Because of all that Third World country garbage
So while these monkeys sweat over my name brands that exchange hands
From enslaved lands, I wonder if I'm the same man
Without reward...for what I bought but CAN'T still afford
This is the type of self-realization that might have killed the Lord
I didn't mind working free as a walking billboard
But now I want my money back...as my ice spilled and poured
Onto the floor I did see a distorted reflection of my Nike hat
I don't know how others might react
For me it was an unsightly act that helped me get my psyche back
I stood 5 feet back, afraid that it might strike me like Shaclack clack!
Ya'll think I'm kidding? It's not big thing
What I seen made my heart hurt, stomach turn, throat burn, teeth cringe
Spine tingle, and ribs sting
I noticed that the swoosh symbol was nothing but a whip in mid-swing..

I don't look at myself in the mirror because I'm a narcissist
I simply like to watch myself exist...(HHHH)
I'm in a fog and mist...(HHHH)

Hey Bobby,Still Sickly Business,1998,"By the time the flags rotted off of their antennas
They were questioning who the real threat is
Big Brotherly love is the 21rst Century's plague
No matter how bloody the glove, question evidence displayed
Don't forget what two plus two equals
Don't let them upgrade your math no matter what they have as proof of evil
Remember when they went after the Jewish people?
You don't recognize that same black mask as see through?
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed and a house that wasn't haunted
I'd rather die for a cause than to die just because
We exhaust natural resources forced into wars
Restoring wasteful ways, keeping other countries poor
""Monkey see, Monkey do"" I wonder what those fucking monkeys saw
Keep rethinking the still-frames in your mind
And guarantee they will change with time
Your outline is pixelated with poor resolution while
Downtime is simply wasted. You were born execution style
Head first in a trial. I'll second the motion
'Til the jury's bored to death and puts your neck in a notion
The situation's volatile. A naked problem child
Is trying to find the right clown costume to make his father smile
So he bombs while he tries to tell jokes
This ain't a false alarm, can't you smell the smoke?
You're in the line of fire where they buy and sell votes
Our sense of liberty doesn't ring true, stupid, that's why the bell broke
Trench coat Mafiosos propel rocks
At recruitment officers and rebel against cops
'Til they hurdle infinite circles in small cell blocks
Turtle upon turtle 'til they're all shell shocked
This so-called president got elected in a court room
With the war efforts of pops he inherited a fortune
We ""talk, talk, talk..."" so the veterans of war assume
The revolution stopped. This ain't a protest tune
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays.""
You can't roam a lost land as the last existing dinosaur
There's no escaping ass kickings in these times of war
Replacing apples with hospitals...where doctors are hostile
Killing two pterodactyls with one fossil
I got you. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in it's bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...and house that wasn't haunted
Thumb through novels to have your fingerprints match
The description of criminals committing innocent acts
Of compassion for tired civilians crawling with pistols
While we fire million dollar warning missiles
Force the issues in the back of your head where eyes roll
Brainwash yourself out of that mind control
Or act a fool like you're told
But we won't see no type of justice 'til that bitch removes the blindfold
This ain't a ""Love it or leave it,"" it's a ""Change it or lose it.""
I'll never sing the anthem of a nation who never faces the music
Chasing an ever-elusive caveman
In space ships that makes trips to the futures that are name-brand
Faking progress...but we ain't advanced
Enough to change the posture of our ape stance?
They've got the key to the city but they prefer the break-in entry
Duck and weave, I'm shedding light in their shadow box to make it empty
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays.""
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed..
There's nothing scarier than the human stories I tell ghosts
Chilling accounts with my tongue frozen to bed posts
The catharses of carcasses whenever threats are close
Shows a heartlessness that doesn't register on stethoscopes
Sell your hopes for a homeland security chart
'Til your sense of self is broke and no man's pure in the heart
Preventive detention for the folks who never left home
Tensions have grown into a 24/7 red zone
Scare tactics...have got you under control
The fear factors of a color code. The uppers know
They can't hold you down without having anchors attached
""It's all the same."" Nah, balls and chains on ankles don't match
So drag your torso back to the off road
We may have lost the fashion battle but we ain't lost the wardrobe
Go window shopping for your next free meal
Cuz when we start the revolution all you'll probably do is steal
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave

Till you need deeper sleep between sheets who need sex

Need to find someone to confide in, and let the rest in need to start restin'
Needless to say, i couldn't hide
Fifteen grown men shouldn't cry
Had i known then what i know now
Had i thought now what i knew then, I might still be human
With all the little stupid fix-ins as I fix sins and vixens vick souls
Stitch clothes for the characters they play then switch roles
Nail me to the cross dress, the holy cloth costs less
I'd toss less If i still had your soft breasts to rest my head on
Since you've been gone I recalled my issues with problems and hate
But i can't exactly remember the model or make
Now glass bottles break in my death grip
I'm about to take the next quick exit and end this head trip
My bed's stripped of its blankets, comforters, pillows and sheets
But i might have to peel off all my skin to remove your scent in order to sleep
I had my highs and lows
When on top I let you peek out over my nose
Sitting on my shoulders and i suppose if i had a backbone, you might still be here
My skin is filthy
From my lows when you weren't there
But to keep from feeling guilty
I collected the dirt (collected the dirt), kept it piling up
Now mr. feel nothing (mr. feel nothing) saves his tears inside of a cup
And he drinks (and he drinks) and he forgets that he's an asshole
Jealous of his ghosts and doubts he even has a soul
My secret pleasures have my inner demons gossiping
I'm a ghost writer for the horrorcore lyrics my personal monsters sing
I'm sitting in a stranger's tub
With all my clothes on, shivering, considering the dangers of love
They get half of what i have to give, if that
It's all about the packaging, they're distracted by the gift wrap
Predictable, easy to manipulate
They're foreshadow puppets and i'm waiting for their strings to break
The pillars that once held up my halfway house have been taken out
I'm in my last days now, there's a change coming soon
I just want to crawl back into my mother's womb
I need a comfort zone but obviously i need to find another home
To call my own, and always return to
And i want it to be you (i want it to be you)
I sit and stare zone out, I think a lot and never sleep
Creating memories to remember and then i forget to eat
Went to the street you used to live on
Staring at the bedroom window of your old home
With puppy eyes waiting for god to throw me a bone
I'd settle for one more goodbye kiss while i settle for less
I'm unsettled at best, sulking while abandoning settlements
Insulting my companions intelligence conversing with baby talk
Practicing mind games. rehearsing with playful thought
It's the way we fought that made my blood bubble then turn cold
When you made me walk through rain and mud puddles on a dirt road
It left me so messy
Forget me not I've got more mud to sling… shot

Had I thought now what I knew then..

Stitch clothes for the characters they play then switch roles
Nail me to the cross dress
The holy cloth costs less
I'd toss less

I recalled my issues with problems and hate

Yeah. One of those kids that'll think ya to death. Hahaha
This Osgood-Schlatters Syndrome in my bones and my knee hurts
Must have jumped into an unclean gene pool feet first
The rebirth of slick hair
With more ""Wooo""s than Ric Flair
Got me blockin' eyes and ears and the rest of my senses are prepared
From the thick air that I breath
How did I get here? I believe
It's time to scream, ""What's the chime?""
They leave no trace
Remove the birth marks from your face
Being handicapped is a bitch
But I'm sick of watching her park in my space
How 'bout I hop up on your face and pop this wheely
Clutch my stick shift, you gots to feel me
Growin' too big for the clown costumes
Stupid wig
Got self proclaimed vets in the game askin' their dogs, ""Who's the new kid?""
I say, ""Um, I'm 32.""
Been here for more than 10 years and never heard of you, so what the fucks your curfew?
""Say what? 10 years? God damn!?
That's practically a decade."" and I say, ""So, you a math man?""
How 'bout we go 50/50 on our friendship
They say, ""Meet me half way, fuck this 50% shit!""
How smart are we? Very smart
Received a Valentine's Day voice mail from Mary Hart and then I passed out
Plus the lights were blinking
Too much leisure induces seizures
I'm blacked out but it looks like I'm thinking
Reaching for the ceiling
Pulling down the skyline
You knew I was around
Once I broaden your horizon just to show you the night time
Captain Kirk beam me back to Price Line
And buy my ticket out of the pop culture
There's no intelligent life to find
I'm off the meter, off the hook, I'm off-line
Frankly I'm awful
So underground, I need an oxygen tank and snorkel
Untrying
To the simple minded, plain and normal
One time
Take me Lord, make me mortal

Yeah, to all my intelligent motherfuckers
(Let's build! Respect respect. Shit is real B! Yeah, respect!)
Peace to all my headcrackin' melon bruisers

Strange Famous Spoken Word,Still Sick... Urine Trouble,UnKnown,"Maybe you're never really living till you've understood what death is
So I touched the human spirit with lyrics some say are breathless
It's that breathlessness that inspired my tired hand
To write these endless epilogues that some call pretentious
Living verse existence surviving, verse thriving in an environment
Vitamin supplements and a government's removal of pensions retirement
Empty out your life savings cause your wife's handing that knife collection
Could have used some type of protection when you sliced through her midsection-8
Even though the sex was great you want belly thin
Didn't want to ruin the love canal and that's why you went Cesarean
And everyone's got your own opinion, ask your librarian about Elián
Legal aliens, vegan terrorist and all of the vegetarian activists
Male malchy and alchemists grab a fistful of calculus pals
Who dissed over the lack of apple cum math-or-piss
Build but calluses on the phalluses of Alice and Wonderland-scapers
Put on your happy face, here comes the hand shakers with sand paper gloves
They wanna jerk you off with, to further off quick
Cause I prefer the soft lips of a whore's kiss
I lick my wounds and force my tongue into the opening
Communicating with infections that took residence when I broke my skin
I've learned their language now my infectious speech gets sickening
But my poetry has become a scab lies just can't help picking
Tickling too many worldly fancies whimpering on my hands and knees
Crawling fast through laundry mats pilfering girlie's panties
Ya heard me? Man please
I ain't take nothing without paying except for school books and blank tapes
Throw in a can-a-pee from a canopy can a pee brain hit me in plain day

Slow Man,LI(F)E,2010.0,"I’m a slow man…
Looking for a slow woman who wants to slow dance
I’m a slow man in my slow man stance
Looking for a slow woman who don’t care that I’m old lookin’
Or got my soul tooken back where the fallen angels land
I know Brooklyn like the back of a stranger’s hand
Can’t recognize my own…I wing it though
I bring it home. Familiarity’s the first thing to go
Next thing you know…there’s a photo that you’re staring at
And you can’t quite place the face that is staring back
Someone erased the names and the facts, dates on the back
Maybe they’re just fading so fast
That you can’t keep up with it. Can’t recover it
Lost in the shuffle of the Grand Prix hustlers
If you can’t keep up to speed with the mother ship
And can’t take the heat then your man needs the oven mitts
I can’t be the judge of it. My hands bleed
’cause they reached for some answers and got trampled by a stampede
Of know-it-all homogeneous types. The look-alikes
The kids burn my music and the parents burn the books I write
I think back to those lonely Brooklyn nights
I was either soul searching or just looking for fights
Each woman had her price. The dice didn’t roll right
All my jobs were odd ones, my problems had bold type
Snow White didn’t expect that I’d leave ‘er
The strobe light set off epileptic seizures
I know right from wrong when I write these songs
My goals in life ain’t what I set my sights on
Slow man. X3
Gotta get up and go, man
I know, man. It’s like I’m half of a whole man
Gotta get back on the program. So let’s go, man
I’m a slow man…in my slow man stance
Looking for a slow woman who wants to slow dance
I’m a slow man in my slow man stance
Looking for a slow woman who don’t mind my home cookin’
I’m no good when I’m a bad, bad man
I’m gonna dance so slow that it appears to be my last stand
But I’m a bad bad man
I’m gonna dance so slow that it looks like a photo

I'mma take you back, take take you back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
I'mma take you back, take take you back (x2)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

I got lectured once while eating breakfast for lunch
Said dad to me ""Reality is nothing but a collective hunch
Whatever you want the truth to be, simply fool the masses
Attack them mentally with tools of power like the Masters
Get em in elementary school and college classes
Eventually you'll overrule their cowardly asses
Don't worry about society, they're all horrible bastards""
With this knowledge I blast kids. stay dark like Howard's glasses
I'm ""Stern!"" plus I rule with an iron fist
With no concern, it's so cruel, where did I learn this?
It's in my gene pool. For permanent bliss
It seems cool, only if you suffer from eternal ignorance
Internal innocence rejects external filth. Hurdle the guilt
My ancestors left. Dress with a traditional kilt
Curdled milk that's under suspicion will get spilt
Ain't no use crying. Who's lying about the empire I built?
Another self proclaimed historian
With Einstein as his passenger, and a flux capacitor in his Delorean
Rewrote my past, taught me sin
When we spoke at last he caught me in the chin
There was no need to ask, I know he fought me to win
My broken task is born again, let a new war begin
I think he saw me grin. Played my ass like a sucka
Turned that brunch between me and my father into our last supper

He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

So now I'm orphaned into this world of a rewritten past
Where they force my girl to clean and force me to sit in class
The teacher laughs as he preaches math, beats me with a staff
Because the text we read expects us to bleed each paragraph
I speed through the chapter fast. My prospectful wife
Hangs her pride at half mast, force fed domestic life
Is giving her a fat ass...she can't eat no more
""We'll see who laughs last"" is what she speaks so sure
As she sweeps the floor
Her bare feet are sore. I'd massage her toes
But she's way too busy doing dirty laundry and washing my clothes
This bastard ass took us back to the dark ages
My heart races. He's got 1 out of 3 blacks locked in cages
Sage is heading for the mic, but they blocked the stages
Dopes took his notebook, said ""Don't look!"" as they blotched the page
Ignoramuses must have ""idio-dildos"" stuck up in their anuses
Dominatrixes explain how pleasurable of a pain this is
I ain't with this game of his.I'm looking for a loophole
Just because you look the part, don't mean you can play, ask Manute Bol
My absolute role is to save whatever is left of me
The last of my true soul, so I dress up like the referee
To get the coach on every bench pissed
They approach me with a clenched fist
So I throw up their past lives and say, ""Catch this!""
They get the drift, but fans rush the court
Propaganda programs they hold in their hands
Brain washed and flushed their thought
Now it's a blood sport. My girl ain't with this strange land
She was fronting like a cheerleader as she figured out the game plan
Made peeks at play sheets, memorized them like the Rain Man
Conducted her own brain scan, then reversed the chain of command
""She learned the formulas?"" The story is unraveling
She seduced Einstein by dressing up like Marilyn..
Monroe. now she's got a Manson look in her eyes
And a grin that's stretching so wide.damn, son, I'm petrified!

She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back(W-W-W-Way Back!)

The Baby Stays,LI(F)E,2010.0,"I got nothing to teach the learning curve of your body
I got teeth that could hurt you probably
With one bite
A tongue with spikes, a rusty knife
I wish you'd take it from me
An gut me like a fish, up tight and selfish
Got a lust for life and a death wish
They're husband and wife and they
Fuck like they're helpless
Am I a product of uninteresting sex?
If I'm bored by your pillow-talk and Newport cigarettes?
She chews on fiberglass like a teething infant
He breathes in her stink and seems indifferent
She dreams of children
He hears the pitter-patter of little fetuses
He's like ""stand by me
There's a leech in my briefs and it's bleeding like a stuck pig
Come quick!""
Think of a baby's name, she wanted to call it ""Quits""
Imma name him Raymond and raise him
Like I don't know my own strength
And bench-press the baby naked
Hold it to the sky, like ""look what I did!
It's mine, and you can't have it.""
Until it rains, and when it rains
He sticks out his tongue to catch it
The baby stays
The baby stays

He just stares into the abyss 'til the abyss blinks
Instincts pop up to the surface like pinpricks
Still flinch
Manhandle the kill switch
Peg meet square, get dismantled by drill-bits
The deconstruction of a functional addict
Leaving assumptions to a bunch of fanatics
It's just standard procedure
With a automatic pilot light
Hide behind a white lab rain coat cause the water broke
Press eject
First comes the head, then the neck
Then the body avalanches out the tape deck
Flappin' on the ground like a fish out of its element
No one wants to acknowledge the carnage, the mess or elephant
That's in the room
Connected to the womb with a lifeline
Labored all day through the morning noon and nighttime
Then we cut the cord, fully aware
What we keep on the inside's too personal to share
Now we hold it in the air, like ""look what happened!""
If we throw it out with the bath water
Will you catch it?
Or let it go down the drain
If it goes down the drain imma snatch it
The baby stays
The baby stays
And I'mma hold it to the sky, like ""look what I did!
It's mine, and you can't have it.""
Until it rains, and when it rains

This ain't no Swan Song, this is for the ugly ducklings of my country

Peep the game, dummy
You can't keep the reign from me
It's us who put in the overtime, they who make the money
Snickering at trickle down economy
We got nickled and dimed It's more like highway robbery
Drive in the fast lane, eyes on the gas gauge
Listen to neo cons cry about black rage
It doesn't stop there
They're the blowhards, they puff out their chest they're full of hot air
Providing entertainment for the status quo
Then once every 4 years they pander to the black vote
Oh, religion ain't a tool of control?
Why they pull the God card once they're losing in the polls
Foolish, I know, we're victims of circumstance
It ain't coincidence we're children of the worker ants
And those in power ain't never owned a pair of dirty pants
But they're quick to kill your health insurance plans
The rich cheat death with their cheap survival
They found more than one way to beat the Bible
Street disciple,  my beats are trifle mega
Don't repeat the cycle, just live your life better
I'mma defeat my rival, that's why I'm writing this letter
To let em know that we ain't givin' up the fight ever

Oh yeah, I've got a weapon of mass destruction
Parked in the back, it's a vessel of gas consumption
Rebels of rap production never adapted to nothing
Imagine my laugh whenever you ask me for something
Like I ain't gave my all
You came fashionably late to the headbanger's ball
After the mob scene lost steam
And after we spilled pig's blood on the prom queen
I've been told with old age comes wisdom (comes wisdom)
But I've found with old age comes old age we're stuck in our old ways
Like everything was done much better
In some forgotten era, thumb sucking America
I can't begin to name, the ways I'd pin the blame
On an administration acting inhumane
If it's killing season let's start within
When the hunter becomes the hunted they outlaw hunting (ain't that something)
Confiscate the ammunition
Cuz there's a wolf in sheep's skin a pitbull with lipstick
A pig in a blanket, some lame duck president
Privatizing profit and socializing debt
Collapsed credit, journalists get arrested
Watch the Blackwater operatives go domestic
Oh, that's a problem? Well don't agonize
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, a whole pack of lies
Summer spring and autumn, now bring the wintertime
I don't protest the snow, I shovel it with picket signs

We have the right to assembly and it's the duty of the patriot
To protect his country from the government
But when we try it, but when we try it but when we try it (conspiracy to riot)
Peace rally with my friends (conspiracy to riot)
When we have no defense (conspiracy to riot)
Rubber bullets to the heads (conspiracy to riot x3)
When we find voter fraud (conspiracy to riot)
When we defy overlords (conspiracy to riot)
When we finally pull the cord (conspiracy to riot x3)
Til the truth is revealed (conspiracy to riot)

Cafe Girl,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"Author: Sage Francis
We walk as two, but we'll leave one set of tortured footprints/
Now here she comes...walking through the door...giving that look. Since/
I roll with shook wimps...I'm shaking in my boots/
Kids are behind me eating steak and soup, talking 'bout beatbreaks and loops/
And I wanna' turn around...join in on the convo, but I ain't got jack to say/
And it's sad to say...I'm just a poetry fag actin' gay in my black beret/
I just came to this wack-ass café /
To drink an ice coffee and kill a bit of time before the matinee/
Why oh why did I need Cappaccino Cooler?/
Now I'm trying to avoid eye contact. Lets see if I can fool her/
I put a look of concentration on my face as I scribble on a napkin/
Squinting my eyes, acting like I'm really serious about this mess of non-sensical pen action/
A web of chicken scratch and ink blots/
Is she still there? Standing awkwardly glaring? I think not/
Look up....think again. Shit...now when/
Is she going stop making me waste ink from my pen as I sit and pretend/
I knew I should have come with a friend. I shrink and I send/
Myself into meditation...and I'm on the brink of Zen/
Is she buying it? I pick up my empty glass...tilt it..and drink the flem/
She's STILL scoping! in fact, this chick's a 10/
At least in my book...which isn't all that well read, but it's been said /
Once she gets her grip on men they simply bend/...backwards
She attracts nerds, jocks, substitutes and student teachers /
Who all profess their love for all of her protruding features/
There's no fooling this creature, she's WAY fine/
So dope, I'd have to smuggle her across state lines or else pay fines/
What's holding me back is what I heard through the grape vine/
She's a non-conformist freak who only comes out in the daytime/
""Don't look at me."" I can feel the burn of her stare on my sensitive skin/
I'm anti-social and I don't know how conversational sentences begin/
Plus, I'm allergic to the medicine of sexual healing/
This impotence is sickening. She's sensual...appealing/
Now I'm covering up my crotch region by crossing my legs/
Lost in thoughts of whores in my bed. It's awful...so I'm forcing my head/
Into my forearms. I should...invite her for a cup of Joe/
It would do more harm than good...I just know/
I mean...she's no Natalie Portman, and I've been kind of holding out for her/
Naturally...Now my thoughts spin...and she's on the ""out"" for sure/
Gradually...contort my mindframe so no doubts occur/
I activate testicular bravery and I shout to her/
Our eyes lock
And time stops.../
She floats over to my spot...
And I say ""Hi, I'm not/
Trying to hit on you like the way all these other guys jock/
I just wanna' let you know...I'm the type of person who lies a lot/
Sometimes I fart and I pick my nose like a maniac/
I'd be glad to front the cost of a date with you as long as you pay me back/
If we ever reach the friendship level where things like that are shared/
And I know my facial hair is weird...but I've been waiting for someone like you to shave my beard/
I'm usually more discreet about my insecurities, but today...I just ain't prepared.""/
In all honesty...this dame just stared/
And I was like ""Uhhh...yeah.../
So ummm...heh...""
Nervous twitches were initiated and out nostrils flared/
Our eyes started wandering and I was rocking in my chair/
I just continued on scared that I lost her...in my upfront approach/
She looked at my napkin and noticed what I wrote/
...which was nothing
I said ""The funny thing is...I could have used you as a muse/
Wrote you sonnets in iambic pentameter and then produced/
Mass amounts of unsent love letters and out-of-tune love ballads/
Some valid...but most just to get you thinking of marriage/
It's untrue. I don't want to create a first impression I can't live up to/
I...just...wanna...

Mourning Aftermath,Personal Journals,2002,"I know I look good
Stop sweatin' me
I'm makin' myself look pretty
I'm makin' myself look pretty for you
I'm makin' myself look prettier
Let me rub my back against the notches on your bedpost
To scratch these afterthoughts off my flesh and shed ghosts
My head's close to your closet door
I've got the glass to my ear. My nose is in your
Business (I smell something fishy here.)
I hear bones rattling. Poems battling for space and time
Phones that'll ring when I make judgment calls with pick-up lines
Sexual hang-ups leave me waiting nude and while alone
It gets aggrivating masterbating to a dial tone
I'm the home to run-away trains of thought
My one track mind is a collision intercourse where victim's cross
Bedroom eyes...uncross their legs exposing inner thighs
I disrobe and show my most convincing disguise
I've lived so many lives each death has left my face scarred
Hid so many lies under my breath that I can't face God
Dig into my mind deep enough you'll find a graveyard
I get nervous bodies will resurface every time it rains hard
""Don't cry, girl."" Let me outline your short comings
My world is full of them and they're all in the long runnings
It's all fun and games. It's all done in vain. It's all a ----ing shame
I ain't the one but I'm the one to complain?
Make love to the present, fuck the past
Make love to the present, fuck the past.Nothing lasts
Don't you dare worry about the morning aftermath
I'm makin' myself look pretty
I'm makin' myself look pretty for you
I'm makin' myself look prettier
Taking an acid bath, pissing on the shower curtain
The gal just laughs and starts dissing my towel turban
I had to ask if she knew how to listen now I'm certain
Now my task is just to get up in her like I was a surgeon!
I'm a virgin who makes exceptions at sunset
My dirty skin gets cleansed by the summer sweat
""Self, have some respect! I don't need you new and clean
But I don't want the procedure routine!""
A screw machine!with a few bolts loose.robot response touch tone
Hair trigger, happy-go-lucky emotion monger wants a love poem
Run home.dip into your closet and jump bones
Your secret admirer's stuck higher up and he's unknown
Looking down on you.can you bare the burden?my ears are hurting
I found a few gears are turning
With squeaky wheels.they get the grease cuz its a damn nuisance
Understand the blueprints for our mechanical movements
It never ran smooth since we abused the Earth
Grabbed a hand full of pubics and removed the turf
Refused its worth, we lose our shirts.she assumed the worst
And needed proof of birth? I'm leaving this universe
It seems doomed and cursed.see if you come first then come fast
Complain.Constrain.Constantly ask
Complicated questions contain scientific answers in your flask
Come and bring us (Confidence). Cunnilingus (Compliments)
Come to thank us went from guilty conscienceness to common sense
Our Common ground meat from man-made concrete
Make love to the present, fuck the past
Make love to the present, fuck the past.Nothing lasts
Don't you dare worry about the morning aftermath

Mullet,Still Sickly Business,1998.0,"It was the (beatboxing) that got me (beatboxing)
It was the (beatboxing), break (beatboxing), deflate
Cause I was gassed
Head over heels in love with the electric drums and spoken vocals
Which was the joke of locals
And laughing stock of my rock-and-roll-ass town
But the rhythmic acupuncture pierced my skin
Pinning the butterflies to my stomach
Which would flutter every time I heard the (beatboxing)
More than the (beatboxing metal)
I was no devil worshiper
Higher level interpreter
I refuse to lose focus and
Recite satanic verses with manic curses
Drug induced worst cause I knew they were saying
""Kill your mother"" cause it paid them well
Yet in my flashback I see the foreshadow
Ironic twist, 
my first purchase was a hip-hop record called Raising Hell
I should have RUN when I had the chance
But DMC's made be wanna break dance
Made me wanna spin vinyl
Made me wanna graph right
Made me want to not act...White
And not to perpetuate any stereotype but
I was not about the mullet ice hockey haircut
You know the mullet
Short on top for the fellas
Long in back for the ladies, yeah
I was not about stonewashed nut-huggers
With the French rolls on the bottom
So tight that it turned my toes purple
Nor was I about the ripped jean jacket with the Megadeath, Metallica, and Slayer patch
I had an internal itch for the (beatboxing) and never
Could I get with (beeheew) guitar riff, the (beeheew) guitar riff
The (beeeeeeehhhhrrr)
I had Wild Style Wars
I rented Beat Street every week
As I Rocked Steady
Wearing out the play, rewind, and slow mo buttons on my VCR
I did the pause-play, pause-play, pause-play, pause-play- all day
Forced my way into comprehension of inner city invention
For me was in the expression
Which would eventually win me acception (one exception)
Those around me couldn't give me affection
But I played and paid that video attention until eventually
I completely bit the (beat boxing)
I found my new religion
Born again b-boy
Born to destroy decoys and be the real McCoy, yeah boy!
I wore the clock so YOU could know the time
Chuck D told me to keep a sober mind
And even though his sidekick liked the flava of BASE
I swear to God, hip-hop was about being drug free
I swore to God hip-hop was about the upliftment of humanity
And I swore to God hip-hop was what rock was not was what rock
Was not, was not pop (pop! pshhhh)
Guess I was gassed
See I remember when Dr. Dre use to Express himself
About hating The Chronic
A few years later he's endorsing it while drinking gin and tonic
Suburbanites that blast Ma$e learn their mad face from Onyx
It was a rat race the first to properly use ebonics
Dynamite like JJ, but it was a Fad like Supersonic
Hip-hop flipped from being artistic to a pop hit
Mainstream took control and we cannot stop it
It's a Black art being manipulated by White controllers
Just like rock and roll is
We took the (beatboxing)
We took the (beatboxing)",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-mullet-lyrics
Gun Gods,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"Does nothing shine unless it's insane enough?
Adjust your rhyme to talk about cocaine and snuff
I-I-I-I don't trust your kind cause you smoke too much angel dust
So when I Busta Rhyme I get +Dangerous+
Plus I crush your spine and turn your brain to crust
When I thrust my mind, get profane and cuss
On every fuckin' line, who's Sage?
Let's discuss
Cause it's such a crime he's a stranger to your lust
The
Secret Service agents must
Go Against all Machines with Rage and disgust
We'll make you rust with saliva and spit
The
Stage will get rushed if your rhymes are counterfeit
Uh
A major plus is if I like the sound of it
Strange enough, you don't know how to get down
So turn it down a bit
Now admit
Sex scenes with wet dreams of fantasies are extreme
My next ? of visual profanities
Of individuals who can't handle these
Were sent to slip
Self censorship
So they say, ""Mind your manners please.""
Yet, when the grandma leaves she returns with damaged knees
I'll let her tickle ivories when I laid her on piano keys
You'll know it's me when I Poetry Slam MCs
I keep a safe distance cause they got the MC Shan disease
Plus they're all about the Puff and Hammer steez
Nastradamus prophesied about these commercial calamities
Make 'em run like how gang colors of a washed bandanna bleed
Get in my B-Boy stance and freeze
From New York to Los Angeles

Now I travel from South Park to North Drive
Cuttin' off guys who talk lies
Sayin' they do walk by's with four fives
Frontin' like they big potatoes
I know they small fries
You can tell they watch their own noses grow
Cause they have crossed eyes
They went from sellin' beans to eatin' pork pies
They lost inside
They should force some pride and then reorganize
IT all resides right outside where abortion lines
I'm heading out
Watch my swollen member that be missin' foreskin rise
Hopefully soon, my inner cold war dies
Secretly, I still look at Russians as if they be all spies
Steppin' in and out of parties, waitin' for a door prize
It's rough between your girlies soft thighs
I'm swatting horse flies
That's access authorization denied
Plus my adult key doesn't work in holes that wide
Hoes that lied about their promiscuous past
You know I dissed you and laughed
After that I'll quiz you in math
Split you in half like an atom/Adam
But we on the Eve of destruction
I had 'em
Leavin' the function
Before it started
They all departed
Sayin', ""Y'all are retarded""
From community colleges to the halls of Harvard
It's sort of bothered
The side of me
That wanted to be a part of society
It's a human need
Too indeed
Why don't you go ask Mazlow
The eye in his pyramid
Caught a cataract from my battle rap
If you have a gat, buck a shot
Those who hold microphones know how to blow up the spot
Y'all fuckin' sluts ain't hot
Turn it up a notch
You ain't a chicken you just cluck a lot
Cover up your crotch",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-gun-gods-lyrics
The Time of My Life,Still Sick... Urine Trouble,UnKnown,"Consider me to be a fly on the wall with a bird's eye view
I stare, as my birthtime drew near
The only Earth I knew reared me in a world I grew to fear
I do appear quite nude and warm
I'm like ""What's up with the lights and the white uniforms?""
You're damn right you're truly wrong when a hand strikes the newly born
""I can't fight"" I'm cruely scorned. In a man's life, the beauty's gone
I was scared with fright through the storm
I'm prepared to write a mutiny song
""It's a miracle Lord!"" Damn my dick is long
Oh, that's just the umbellical chord
Clip clip, snip snip.and now it's gone along with my foreskin
One of them awful things that they do to the offspring
The sting is lessened by the drugs they pump into my miniature body
Making us addicts just that quick is their signature hobby
An infamous robbery, and if I'm not careful then my shaft'll break
It's got me coming up with creative ways to masturbate
I wanna be held but my father rebelled and my mother's unconscious
I went from a dark bliss to some boxes
It's obnoxious the way the doctors poke and prod
Seriously I can barely function
This is my first out-of-body experience and alien abduction
I'm barely a munchkin after just minutes of labor
They're putting my tiny footprints on some birth certificate paper
My personal hell of isolation began in an incubator
To think of it later, slice open my wrist and check the microchip data
They didn't capture it on beta film or audio
The year made me a dragon, the month made me a scorpio
The weak, feeble, helpless baby boy cried for nights
But that day was the time of my life
But that day was the time of my life
But that day, but that day was the time of my life
But that day, but that day, but that day, but that day, but
That day was the time of my life

It's like, I don't know how to act
It's like my fan of one hundred?
Just flung math?
It's like, I've been Keanu Reeves understudy for the past year and a half
It's like, I'm a full-fledged member of the 90210 cast
It's like, I'm ??? yeah! I'm a ??? coming fast
It's like, I'm ??? dude, I'm serious you're gonna get your cash
It's like, I'm trying to cover up my pain with laughs
See, me and irony we go way back
You can peep us exchanging insults and snaps on 8-track
But once the laughter dies down I'm always the one who has to face the fact
And finding method in his madness is like a needle in a haystack
And he'll take that, took it, good one
You know what irony?
I've come to the realization that laughter ain't the best medicine
It's just a primitive form of Novocaine
This kid is to live long and know the pain
So while substances float through the veins of my father to control his brain
I'm resistant from the X's etched on my back written sober and plain
I'mma go to your grave
Before I die
At least one time
I promise, but to be honest I'm just not ready for the punchline",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-the-time-of-my-life-lyrics
High Step,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"Take a Knee
Take a Knee
Take a Knee
Take a Knee
You can't make it to heaven with a high step
You can't make it to heaven with a high step

I played both sides of the field
I was better at defense
They put me out for special teams
The college league wasn't impressed
But the press called me a work horse
I ignored it like the crowd
I had calories to burn off
And I made my parents proud
A jersey with a number that concealed faulty equipment
A cog in the machine but the team saw me as different
Old beyond my years
My chest hair was like a carpet sweater
They made me leader
I wore that C like a scarlet letter
Whether hot or cold
I had to avoid the loss
And play better then the competitor
Whether or not I won the coin toss
I watched it flip in slow motion
While I considered the odds
But it's a sin to gamble
So I left the risk to God
We had a locker room prayer
Where we all lobbied the lord
I pretended to know the words
Bowed my head and mouthed along
That was my way then
I was a slave to the play pen
Where I tried to make friends
And couldn't wait to say ""Amen""
I hit the field
With a shield that was dented
And a sword that was warped by the wars that I've entered
I'm a veteran
With all this medicine on my plate
'Cuz the game that we played
Was ""How Much Pain Can You Tolerate?""
Can you do it without showing no signs of it?
Without fooling yourself so you don't know when it's time to quit
Hell no!
Well, Amen
Give me the pig skin, kid
I'm head hunting for Satan
I'm throwin' elbows
'Til they're breaking
The coach made 'em look normal just by the that he taped them
I never went pro
I got paid in admiration and respect
But all of that seems to be changin'

Tried to make it heaven with a high step
I tried to make to heaven with a high step
I tried to make to heaven with a high step
And get get it get it done
Before we reach sudden death

Death is a pussy
Death is a pussy

Well I'm gone (go on then)
Can I kick it

Before this did you know what my real name was
Paul Francis acting like he's on the same drugs
Never even felt the effects of a strange buzz
You never ever catch me holding a beer mug
Your talking shit like as if you was a real thug
If that's true lick a shot BUCK feel the slug
That's what you get for totin guns like you were Elmer Fudd
I'm selling tapes for three bones wanna catch a dub?
This shit is dope kid it makes you wanna cut the rug
Illuminati's got every part of my body bugged
The micro chip is in your wrist now give it a tug
Be nice to females give a bitch a hug
Triple X styles coming cleaner than your tub
You better tell your girl about it because she's a scrub
A big problem that I had to nip in the bud
Dropping me her seven digits while I'm in the club
Talking 'bout I look I need a back rub
Son she's a natural disaster like a flash flood
I ain't playin dawg you better go test her blood
Until your positive she's negative don't make no love
With or without a glove, you know what I'm speaking of
The cub scouts try and jump into the briney shrubs
Behind the bush turn a back push into a shove
What you thinking trying bring the underground above?

make you cry like a dove

The Write,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"This is to the woman who I loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced
But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts of being double crossed
Still there's no love lost
Now I can't even start this. I see no light inside the darkness
So whatcha want, miss? don't check my pulse because i'm heartless
You were my life support. And in a sense my defense fights the thought
I'll try to keep this one nice and short
Our four chambers beat in unison
I'm wanting you to listen to the dead silence in my defiance
I used to sin and be intrigued by violence
Now as I glimpse into the past I thank God for your guidance
Alas, I give my eyes a rinse
Blink and think in retrospect...realize you need to get your respect
I apologize as I holler cries
Cause it's you and not these college guys that keeps my knowledge wise
You're my crutch. but now I fall cause you're someone i can't touch
Now no one wants to help me up and that's too much
Even my wisdom fell. i'm in a living hell
Throw my inner child back in the prison cell
Incarcerated hatred is causing conflict
With the free love sentencing death to the convict
My soul is on skid row, where can this kid go?
I'm homeless, how could you notice when this whole world didn't know?
It's time i make public just how personal we got in private moments
Because lies are our opponents
Forget material or superficial stuff
I either let you know too much or not enough
This is to the woman who i loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced
But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts
Of being double crossed, still there's no love lost. There's no love lost
I can't pretend this. The impact on my life has been tremendous
It can't be fixed with a friendly kiss
What's endless?
Questions, pain, grief and misbelief?
I'm so faithful all I grind is my teeth
But what I find beneath the surface has changed from priceless to worthless
This three ring circus of clowning around is what hurts us
My brain short circuits as my mind starts to wander
To discover another lover. I'm isolated, living somber
She's whispering ""come hither from there yonder.""
I don't think i wanna. The pressure ain't gettin' lesser
Open my dresser...it overflows with memorabilia
Momentos of our success now symbolize my failure
I took time to write you diaries when we couldn't speak much
According to you that was a weak touch
Cause ""actions speak louder than words."" Turn up your hearing aid
You made this man afraid. Put the pin back in the hand grenade
There's not much time left til I'm left with nothing but a broken promise
While every syllable I said was spoken honest
We expected each other to be a physic mind reader
Don't tell me ""life goes on."" I need her...
Next to me...
So once again I can feel the high of ecstasy...
We tripped...walking down the aisle of destiny
Respectful sexually, because see...I understood
And I don't know too many people who would
Have done anything to get a laugh from their better half
I should have sensed it sooner...when you lost your sense of humor
Now let my soul speak, I couldn't eat for a whole week
With no sleep. The price I pay for being a control freak
Now I'm screaming inside my pillow instead of dreaming
I must have said ""I love you"" so much that it lost it's meaning
But no one's perfect, so where's my chance to make adjustments?
It's worth it...if our romance had substance
Because with purity we conceived marriage
Til insecurity caused a miscarriage
This is to the woman who i loved but lost
Intertwined souls of the universe got divorced
But it wasn't forced. got single thoughts of being double crossed...
I was in it for the long run
Now who's the weak and the strong one?
I tried to be Mr. Right, though things were wrongly done
But ummmm...When it was time for sacrifice
Straight up, you didn't have to ask me twice
I put off this rap device
I wasn't ACTING nice, all my feelings they were genuine
You got me open and I let you in
But now you're screaming bloody murder. Used the entrance as the exit
Now you're absent like my mind, i'm on a head trip
You never said shit. Used then misused the entrance
And never let me get in one sentence
Forget friends...you were my best one
Now I'm depressed, son. It didn't take long for the stress to come
Memories be my arch nemesis
As i sit and reminisce, wondering if you remember this:
Our genesis. First experiences on old dates
Got cold shakes and tingles, never single, we were soulmates
That term used to hold weight but now it's temporary
And lately I've been making trips to the cemetery
Ain't nothing evil in death, but this feels devilish
I'd never wish this on my worst enemy
Remember me",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-the-write-lyrics
Freestyle Confession,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"Yeah, check this. Uh. Sage Francis
In an effort to salvage even the slightest percentage of what I once had
Has left me with vital organs, which much has hemorrhaged
My innards twist and turn, I'm convinced that sin is learned
Their lesson once the minutes burn, not their soul
I'm sick with concern about my operative role
Deadbeat inhabitants
On planet Earth
Are programmed at birth to be apathetic at events
Even if athletic they're inadequate
Turning sexually active to abstinent, mentally absent
You're not accepting of me, new accent
Different tone
Whether listening on the phone long distance or reading an interesting poem
In this instance
Hearing a song spoken out
I can fill my tub with confidence and still soak in doubt
Stick some soap in my mouth
When I speak in bubbles
It'll give me the appearance of a cartoon and weaken my troubles
Then with every step I take I'll be leavin' puddles
And though you damp, everybody drowns when I flood town
I'm being to discreet and subtle
Man, you figure this kid would be learning
To stay away from ambiguous wording
Understand it's disturbing
Purposefully I stall
How many times can I be treated rudely during a courtesy call?
I've been left with a dial tone
Yes denied on the phone
I'm depressed, I'm alone
Time to forget writing a poem
My mind's been set, the light has been shown
I'll confess on the microphone
Now in the past year, I've done some of the worst things imaginable
Not including making songs that hopefully bring capital
I've resided in places that are practically inhabitable
And I know none of this really matters to you but I shall continue
In recent months
I don't think I've been decent once
My view of this world has been skewed, I see all priests as punks
Respect for women?
All bitches, freaks and stunts
My mental is temporal cause my physical has increased with lumps
That could be cancerous
But I try to convince myself there's no chance of this
Since all I've been doing is paying attention to physical health
The medicine on my shelf goes untouched
Don't wanna admit, I need help
Even though I know I need help, but I can't help it
I've accepted a hard truth
Given by ma dukes
See as a kid
I always peeled off fresh scabs that left me with a scared youth
You can check my blemishes and tarnished background if you want proof",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-freestyle-confession-lyrics
I Apologize,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"      
No one else make notes to know thyself
Those who loathe?...love them
Those who love?...show them what it is to loathe
If they don't show you love still...fuck em
Everyone's potential enemy who loves to diss
Virtual acquaintances only exist on a buddy list
I'll hug and kiss myself to sleep
While needing something else to eat
While needing someone else to feed
But eggshells are stuck in my feet
I'm sick of beating around the bush
While needing to push past creative limits
And I don't have anything else left to say to the critics
Is it just because we're different y'all can't stand it?
Or that I backstroke against the current and the culprit is aerodynamics?
Heroes might panic though I clown around to be the silliest...
Man alive, well I'm dead serious
Take me for a jokester and you'll only miss the punchline
Every friend of mine has dissed me at least one time
I've come to find life is consistently unkind
I've kissed the sunshine. sip it sometime until your lips become blind
Now i've lost it, or am I losing it, or did I never have it?
Aspirin addicts are avid advocates of happiness in tablets
They're adamant about their acid trip
I want a bite of the apple Adam bit. Catholics don't know the half of it
Immaculate magic tricks. experimenting with alliteration and assonance
But speaking too many cold words chapped my lips
There's an asterisk up on my left arm
But my foot notes are out of tune from my music always getting stepped on
Should've kept calm when I was granted the chance
But that's my song getting me amped, so god dammit let's dance
Dammit, bring this stuff to fisticuffs if that's the only thing that'll help
Someone like you feel good about yourself and the things your dealt
I'll win the belt but if you need to keep your pants on...
Here another battle for you to talk about in your damn song
Here another battle for you to talk about, wow, look at that...
Another...battle...rap
You won't have to duck, i'll just talk over your head
Knowing your dead career has one year left
Til everyone else knows what I said
They're laughing at you but you don't know it yet
I'd say it to your face but I don't want to waste the moment. Let...
Everyone first understand the open threats that poets get
Who's wet behind the ears? who broke a sweat?
Jiggy man - sip your moet
Thuggy dun- hold your tek
Netcee - go on the net and keystyle '
Bout how we gets no respect",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-i-apologize-lyrics

Slow Down Ghandi,UnKnown,UnKnown,"There once was a song called ""Arrest The President""
Contemporary music, a hit with the kids, it was a top ten
I wasn't pop then, so I missed the bus a bit
But politics was on everybody's hot this summer list
And the cool kids were all rockin' votes
I shit you not, I was pistol whippin' cops for hip hop, booyea!
On my soap box yellin' into megaphones
Killin' hard rocks usin' carcasses as steppin' stones
Had to promise that I'd stop holdin' my marches
The day that Chris Columbus got crucified on golden arches
My pedestal was too tall to climb off
In fact that's the reason for the high horse
And from up here I see Marines and Hummers on a conquest
Underdogs with Wonderbras in a push-up contest
All for the sake of military recruitment
It felt like Kent State the way they targeted the students
I galloped off whistlin', ""Ohio""
The rest of them, stuck doin' stand up at a cricket convention
What would they die for?
Is it the same machine that leaves the quality of life poor?
An abominable colony of cyborgs
Cloggin' up the property that I bought with eyesores
That clever ad campaign ain't worth
The time taken from minimum wage labor
I don't care how half-naked or fake she looks
She smells like dirty cash and aged paper books
What would she die for?
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' em
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' em
Now it's whistle blower versus the pistol holder
Case dismissed, they'll lock you up and throw away the key witness
Justice is the whim of a judge, check his chest density
It leaves much room for error, and the rest left to destiny
The West Memphis 3 lost paradise
It's death penalty versus suicidal tendencies
All I wanted was a fuckin' Pepsi Institution
Makin' you think you're crazy is a billion dollar industry
If they could sell sanity in a bottle
They'd be charging for compressed air
And marketin' healthcare, they demonize welfare
Middle class eliminated rich get richer til the poor get educated
But some of y'all still haven't grown into your face
And your face doesn't quite match your head
And I'm waitin' for a brain to fill the dead space that's left
You're all, ""Give me ethnicity or give me dreads""
Trustafundian rebel without a cause for alarm
Cause when push turns to shove you jump into your forefathers arms
He's a banker, you're part of the system
Off go the dreadlocks in comes the income
The briefcase, the freebase, the sickness, the symptom
When the cameras start rollin' stay the fuck outta the picture pilgrim!
The briefcase, the freebase, the sickness, the symptom
When the cameras start rollin'
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
Mr. Save The World, spare us the details
Save the females from losin' interest
And Miss Save The Universe you're a damsel in distress
Tied down to a track of isolated incidents
Generalize my disease
I need a taste of what it's like
Livin' off the fat of kings
I play the scab at your hunger strike
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' 'em
One love, one life, one too many victims
Republicrat, Democran, one party system
Media goes in a frenzy, they're stripped of their credentials
Presidential candidates can't debate over this instrumental
Let 'em freestyle, winner takes all when the music's dead
I'll have Ted Nugent's head hangin' on my wall
Kill one of ours, we'll kill one of yours
With some friendly fire, that's a funny term, like civil war
Six in the morning, police at my crib
Now my nights consist of two toothpicks and eyelids
The crucifix and vitamins, music that is pirated
New flavored food made of mutated hybrids
Uh, they tell me that it's not that bad
It fucks you up good, but it's not that bad
They hold on to these tales till it's the dog that wags
God save us all if he lets the cat out the bag
Who's the one to blame for this strain in my vocal chords?
Who can pen a hateful threat but can't hold a sword?
It's the same who complain about the global war
But can't overthrow the local joker that they voted for
They call the shots but they're not in the line of fire
I call the cops but they're breakin' the line of duty
Let's call a stop to the abuse of authority
The truth keeps callin' me, and I'ma live to tell the story
So look for truth, quit seekin' forgiveness
You need to cut the noose, but you don't believe in scissors
You support the troops by wearin' yellow ribbons?
Just bring home my motherfuckin' brothers and sisters
Cause they don't call the shots but they're in the line of fire
I'd like to call the cops but they're breakin' the line of duty
It's time to call a stop to the abuse of authority
The truth keeps calling me and I'ma live to tell the story
Meadow superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from a farm, reachin' with your arm
Come away with me to another ranch
We can rely on a tree-branch, greeting is on",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-slow-down-ghandi-lyrics
Follow Me Snippet Verse,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"The secretive type
I like to creep in the night
But I speak under my breath to be polite
I'm talking about you
Unconspicuous keep killing that sweet feeling
The mystique's building
I only speak to the freakishly sheep children
For some cheap thrill thing
I'll be willing to make purchases on my credit card
As long as its of discrete billing
I am expected to get murdered by bombs
So I open up my mailbox with surgical tongs
Rubbing antibacterial paste on my virginal palms
Then it gets a little less complex in Oedipus words from my momz
I've heard of the song by the guy
What's his face who say's those things
I love that song
I think its called ambiguity
And the music be
Handed to you and me
In the form of animal cruelty
I'm heading to the laboratory
To free some mice today
Heading back to the lab
To prove the skin color of Jesus Christ is gray
Impressionable minds have nothing even nice to say
Your brain is putty in my hands
My man it seems just like some clay
See I'm strange
I'll take my time to rearrange
Your frame of mind
You'll want to be the Sage wait in line
With the rest of them grape vines
Swinging idiots
You ain't busting no grape and making wine
You ain't duplicating my rhyming bitch
I'm older and dirtier than that bastard baby Jesus is
Masturbating penises in an alley way where she just is
Thinking that's enough and it is
Asking can I live
Is the way these asinine kids imply that they are dead
Already they are
Get in your car
Release the breaks
Put it in neutral
I won't steer you wrong
This way to the future
Follow along
Come follow me",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-follow-me-snippet-verse-lyrics
Life is What Distracts You From Death,Still Sick... Urine Trouble,UnKnown,"Yo I got this, I got this, it goes like this, unh
Life is what distracts you from death
Gaspin for breath
Grabbin your chest
Now look to God and ask him what's left?
No answer, now how can I pass the test?
I can't figure out the order of this bastard's mess
I'm feelin disasterous
Massive stress
It's futile like you child trying to sell me bags of sess
Now put that to rest
I'm sportin rags when I dress
While you're mad obsessed
With Tommy Hil, Polo and Guess
Got selected best when rap was a braggin contest
Now you could of sounded like THIS
To sell records act possessed
I've blasted the best
Fast like the wild west and had intercourse with the bulletholes in the chest
Hooooes need to get their fat asses dressed
Masters of sex
Must have been molested ___?___ committed incest
Violated mother earth, grabbed her ass and breasts
Got father time ticked off the kid's soft I had to fess...up
I never fuck with what your raps suggest they make me laugh mos def
As you get gassed by the press
Me? I'm ridin on E, I got no gas left
I had to walk my way home but I forgot the address
Once I got there I had no access
To my house
Moms changed the lock cause of my bad ass mouth
My bad ass mouth? I ain't one to hold back
I know I'm jet white for some reason my balls act bald black
Ask your girl about 'em yo that bitch is so whack
She gave my spirit a disease called the sooooouuuuul clap
The way she does when she smoooookes crack
You don't believe me? look here I got the koooodak moment
Opponents are slow to react
Like when I got to gave a pound and you throw dap
Now you know that
Every man is listenin
Change your hand positioning
It makes no sense like a satanic christening
They panic from all the shit I bring
You ain't been dissed by Sage yet? just keep on listening
I make it interesting
They keep distancing themselves from what I have to say
Peace to my family members that are gone and passed away
Day after day it makes me think about my worth and purpose
On this earth's surface
Since birth, this world has been a circus
Of three rings
Once Armageddon begins
We'll hang ourselves from the tree limbs
With G strings
You see there's too much swinging
From the hips
Read my lips
As you watch what I say you're hopin that my toungue slips
But I made Linda ""Tripp"", turned Kenneth to a ""Star""
Sex scandals just distract you from the real problems there are
Don't get fooled my the media
Don't believe everythin you read or eat, everythin they feed to ya
Emcees to me, HA, they got lazy lips
I'mma take hip hop back to Eighty-Six

Respect the Broccoli Cock,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"I've got broccoli cock
How many vegetarian women are in the house
And would like to stuff their mouth with my chlorophyll?
I gets more than ill
I left heads for deaths beds with my morbid skill
And I've got whores to kill, excluding Lauryn Hill
Lauryn Hill's pretty and her voice rules
And she sings other people's songs so well
Kiss but don't tell and if you ever do
That'll be the last time i take you to the heavy petting zoo
We can dry hump until the cows come home
Round up the cattle while I treat my rug burned
Cauliflower love burns, son ya heard?
It branches out in every which way
And lubrication comes from what your lips spray
Some what that kid say, what I said yo
My bitches got mad flavor  heavy flow
Mentally I'm busting more cherries than that kid named Telly
I'm friendly like Casper after I take advantage and vanish
I'd ask you your name but I couldn't care less
I'm just wondering if those are real breasts
So now I'm checking out your headlights, you ran the red light, special
Squeezing my head tight
Pressed right into your out-of-proportion chest
All right, they're mad fake
Now I'm just concerned with whether or not they can lactate, no?
Turn around and make that ass shake, ho
For false advertising, wasn't that surprising?
I mean with all that experience
You still don't know how to work around your periods
Get a calendar and stop prostituting your love notes from J.D. Salinger
Don't make me get mad at ya, I've got nothing but love for ya
I've got nothing but love, for dumb sluts
Hike up your skirt a little more
Why even bother wearing a shirt if it's so small, whore
Show off your navel with some ornaments
You won all events in the whore tournaments
Congratulations, gold medal finalist
I don't mind your mindlessness
It's the only reason I exist
Timeless mind, ageless body, hardly, Sage's hobby, probably
Speaking male chauvinist pig latin to some outrageous hotty, naughty
Do I make you horny baby, do I?
Didn't think so, drink slow and I'll be more fly
You can judge a harlot by the thickness of her beer goggles
Turning the most repulsive weird cock pools into Calvin Klein underwear models
Convenient isn't it, I'm not lenient when I'm ripping it
Nor am I as obedient, barefoot pregnant in the kitchen shit
But what's the ingredient when bitches strip, I'm just not seeing it
It's not intricate, they need to think of it
I mean I'm sexually frustrated, that's where all this hate is coming from

La la la, la-London {*2X*}
London Bridge is, is falling
London Bridge is falling
And the Tower of Pisa is leaning
The Statue of Liberty is green with envy
Penny for your thoughts, penny for your lows
The clothes and dress codes
Tradition of false things
London Bridge is falling
India's got salt on its coast
There's a tea party in Boston
London Bridge is..
Made of wood and clay, that wouldn't stay
No matter how hard the people prayed the materials just washed away
They could have used rocks, rocks don't bend or bow
But quite frankly they had too many enemies to stone
In the Empire (the Empire) State
The Empire State is Building
The Taj
 is on fire; these horus cats make a killing
Heathens bow down to the sirens
An emergency for bread and cheese (rioters shut up and freeze)
Uhh, the Earth shall inherit the meek
When Canada puts up a fence cause their medicine's so cheap
America's asleep (yeah I'm snoring)
And London Bridge is... and London Bridge is falling
I got the best seat in the house
They hired me as a watchman - London Bridge is falling
India's got salt on its coast
There's a tea party in boston, London Bridge is..
Made of stainless steel and wrought iron
That wall in China ain't so great, I built a bridge over a hymen
It goes up to the sky and Mother Mary is cryin
My fair lady, don't cry, it's gonna be alright!
Cus I'm alive - I'm alive and kickin
Tea party in Boston (tea party in Boston~!!)

Sage Francis is out of it. He done switched his tone
Closet Alcoholics Anonymous, bitch, I drink alone
Nobody knows so I press on..
I go to Fugazi shows requesting Minor Threat songs
Drunk driving for Exxon. Don't slalom the icebergs
It's smooth sailing til the boat bottom bites curbs
No problem, but my sight's blurred. Don't serve me drinks
Because I'll write the words that make this whole world sink
I'm bitter, sweet and sour, shit, I need to shower, shit and shave
Stuck to the TV and completely out of it these days
I've got a CD. F**k the counterfeit DJs
Who first fronted on our vinyl then bought Bounce off EBAY
I'm sick of headwraps...they meditate on rhymes
Swing lead bats...to elevate their minds
Get back...Emcees ain't f**king righteous
Craig Mack ain't never got his meat lumped like this
(CHORUS)
(Verse 2:
I am a nightmare walkin', psychopath stalkin'
Natalie Portman with a blank tape in my walkman
Talkin to myself over instrumental cassettes
The essential steps of having graphic, telepathic mental sex
Mind f**k me or get the hell off of my head case
Suck it up or spit it out. How's that medicated bed taste?
I replaced the sheets. I love ripping off pillow cases
Breaking teeth, shoving lip glass in your little faces
Like that! ""Do you like that?""
""If you had hands attached to your arms would you fight back?""
I hijacked your daughter's school bus
Dismantled ridiculous religions that supply Gods that you trust
Whose plush style of living and senseless spending
Is eh-heh-heh-heh-endinnnnnnng
Sage Francis manages bandages on cancerous mannequins
Standing in pajamas with bananas and candid cameras

Come on y'all! (Damage) You know the damage (Damage) (SMILE FOR ME! - BRUISE YOUR FACE AND DANCE!)

This music's got abusive roots, fists hit my face on rough nights
You think bruises are cute but, trick, you ain't my blood type
Some strike the wrong nerve (the way they converse is weak.)
Others write with strong words (they can't build the nerve to speak.)
Verbally inept except when subjects are expected
Preconceived conversation styles. ""That small talk shit was written kid!""
Caught me. Watch me freestyle this bowel movement
You won't hear no ""ooohs"" or ""ahhhs"" when I choose to use no vowels STUPID!""
Thought I was kidding when I wasn't, bitch?
Shit is HOT. Plumbers unclog my toilet wearing over mitts
Your mommy thinks I'm dope...there's no pretending I'm not
Put hockey sticks in your throat...from the penalty box
Enemies jock while their girl shows athletic support
Having sex for the sport of it on basketball courts
Maintaining my composure when game night is over
And I don't strike a pose...I strike a poseur. Doin' DAMAGE

I quickly enter your honey dip, strip ends from your money clip
Joe Beats you to death with the shit end of his ugly stick
Fighting drama queens in the white college scene
Wiping pockets clean when we make them run their shit like soccer teams
After they're chased with an axe...half of their face'll collapse
You ain't copped it when Non-Prophets dropped bass on wax?
Well, I'm your typical hiphop political figure
But I'm not left wing OR right wing. I'm the middle finger
And Joe's a sick, demented, jaded mind reader
Who shoots the shit with a nickle-plated 9 MiliMeter
When it's time to rock SHUT THE F**K UP
I never had writer's block and Joey's never been in a production slump
(Jump, Jump) It's totally worth it now
(Jump, Jump) Don't listen when they say it's not
(Jump, Jump) It always hurts coming down
This is MY house, you don't like it? Get the f**k off of my rooftop

Emperor’s New Clothing,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"I listen for secrets hidden in whispers
And in the winter time I catch them tickling my whiskers
Colliding with wind chimes
The type that send shivers up and down tingling spines
Thinking time could stretch if
We'd spin a design inside our web that would catch drifts
The type that blow out birthday candles before we make our death wish
I'm waiting for a message in my calling; I'm checking my voicemail
And I'm answering machines with man made dreams
Man made band-aids cover up the seams and the cover-up seems
To only work if the wound never opens up or bleeds
Beads of sweat form above the eyes of a heathen Emperor
Who won't get on his feet and step outside into the freezing temperature
He wants to adjust the global thermostat
But he's so remote; you can't control the world like that
Come to find these eggs ain't even golden
I see depreciation in the family jewels the Queen is holding
That marriage was fixed; it happened when her feet were frozen
She still remains to be the only one who's seen the Emperor's new clothing...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-emperors-new-clothing-lyrics

And MCs they ain't nervous they just  a lot
And you're not an alcoholic you just drink a lot
I'm burning pages with my pen because my ink is hot
I've got twelve melted pens that end in my pocket protector
My man chilling inside a  that's my sector
We wrecked a instrumental
Every time a freestyle cypher  inside a temple
Get gentle and sentimental when I cuddle with freaks
Still I can't get my mind off all the trouble in the streets
MCs bite my rhymes while I struggle to eat
Mad DJs are clowns but they can't even juggle beats
Plus all they flare is nostrils
And all they know about the  is what they learned at the hospital
They got twelve punches but no technique in their arsenal
I seen one kid try to transport me, that shit looked impossible
It was the obstacle, where's your knowledge of hip hop
Microphone hogs get their lips knocked
Straight out of low cash of gut  just like prince rock
I'm about to spread my asscheeks on your ears and let my shit drop
Dank cans are leaving space on my hands
And I'm a dangerous man who brain scans
I try to not rock name brands
Your mom will wear Adidas till her death
Singing all day ""I dream about Sage"" under her breath
I wonder what's left of the underground heads
 heart in your hip hop to me it sounds dead
Base nine on your bed I heard your girl yell next
You ain't a pimp just because that bitch sells sex
But you ain't a player just because you wear a jersey
No fear no mercy
Scared MCs can't do nothing but swear and curse me
Swearin to hearse me but I don't know the pain
It's like menthol Novocaine for my clean and sober brain
I let the poppers pop and the breakers break
I represent B-Boys with the back pains and headaches
I make fakes run home just throw the one poem

Tell them to act like men then i'll fight them
Let em hit me first then be like ""strike again!""
Then its my turn to see how far the limbs of little tykes bend
I tied em up, with burlap rope. ""word?thats dope.""

Yo, this is Sage representin Secret Service, yo
Welcome to my world kid I've been waitin for a long time
You come with memories and leave with a free will and a strong mind
It's all fine I hope your girl came prepared
My facial hair is like a web I'm catchin knowledge in my beard
Not much is kept though, it's let go into the dying hunger
I'm catching teardrops on my tongue from the crying thunder
Why am I younger than you thought I was? Be patient
Soon enough you'll see through my physical into a soul that's ancient
My mental age exceeds my chronological it seems illogical
Full comprehension remains marginal
Fully phenomenal wait forever for invasion
Time, it ain't nothin but an unsolved equation
My mind is a prefound universe filled with curse words
My rhyme is a release of peace thought as I disperse verbs
Design a plan of escape into oblivion
Seriously I can't withstand the land that we're both living in
Come with me and give me support, supply assistance
We'll drive the distance and probably die in the persistence
Of breaking free from the age old constraints
Infinity continues, the life force curls fate
The energy drains from the power surges, devoured the urges
The fear is primal when the final hour emerges
Procrastinate and wait until the last minute
My ass is in it, to win, for an infinite
Number of light years as I fight fears that I felt
Since time began let my mind expand with no help
Trying to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine
Putting a chill in my spine, ready and willing I'm
Killing Time
Couldn't be no iller crime
Trying to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine
I'm killing Time
Before I reach my prime
Killing time, Killing time
I grab ahold of the hour hand it's got too much power man
Devouring my plan every now and then
I try to break it down again Go from plan A through Z
Smoothly my mission turns into a murder mystery movie
Move me into a better rap protection witness program
Don't understand Time is no time to have fear for no man
Your whole clan could hold scams I got schemes that ain't been tried before
That's what you're dying for I'm hiding from the law
Ducking cops, aimlessly bucking shots
Open one day for a lucky hit and time *ucking stops
I ain't up for props I'm out to get mine with a time-seeking tech nine
Get the job done before my deadline
My schedule's tight I'm marking off years on my calendar
Decades of game play without a challenger
My excalibur is getting cold and rusty can't get a soul to trust me
Time took its toll and left me old and dusty
Whew! Blow off the dust mites I just might bust mics
Put up fights throw fisticuffs and thrust strikes
Put enough might to hold it off in the meantime
Cuz Time ain't nice I'm climbing for life so I don't mind the price
I have to pay day after day to make the laughter stay
And teardrops fade away
Understand the plan, scheme, scam, and plot
Remove your lips from the bottle and your hand up to the Glock
I'm tryin to make the clock draw blood while I be spilling mine
Putting a chill in my spine ready and willing I'm

Question Their Motives,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"I have entered
This wonderful world of politics
Where white collar tricks got me on a proper fix
Til' they want me to talk about
Hollow tips, ganja hits and vodka sips
They got sick of topics like the apocalypse
So I start to mix lots of shit suggested by outsiders
Who should get off on the(?) open their mouths wider
I'd rather go down on the vagina of little Kim during her period
Then be forced to make a joke of my existence and be a silly kid
Who never questions the placement and purpose of each Egyptian pyramid
I'll stick to eccentric epics and construct another Iliad
Turn on my television and channel Homer
Ward off the evil spirits with some incense and candle aroma
That's not as sellable as a vandalist persona
So to hell with them
I'm a tough guy
Watch me crush this can of soda
Rrrr
Tin is putty in my hand
I'mma continue to sit over til' everybody understands
That sincerity is sincerely lacking in show biz
Talking about walking a route of evil giving your ho HIV's
I'd rather be having you walk the avenue of insight that my flow gives
When an MC records records question his motives
When a DJ plays that record question his motives
See you don't understand
I know kids who say they're addicted to sex
When in actuality they're addicted to sexual images
Masturbating
Their brain in intellectual scrimmages
Inside of every conceptual lyricist is a thug rapper
And in every gun-clapper there is a metaphycisist
Heads listen to this knowing there is truth in the sarcasm
But who's hearts spasm
When they hear us execute arts to the maximum potential
Blast an instrumental
Find a self professed freestyle king
And ask him to get mental
Confiscate his writing utensil
Dental records link the teeth marks he left biting his pencil to his crab actions
Another fraud is identified
Now when there are ciphers, he is no longer let inside
He shall remain an outsider
Feel the pain of a pariah
If you've got a closed mind
Then I'll open your brain wider
Say hi to your jock writin' counterparts
As I rip your town apart
With people you consider confidants
After my mantra starts
Bask in my nonchalance
And creates a relaxing ambiance
As I drip wax on your body parts
The rapture hardly stops
I capture hotties hearts with a spatula cause it's probably hot
Catapult some ish
To.. Milosevic
Til' he stops acting like such a bitch
Trying to make cultures switch
And that'll end the sorrow
Inside of Denver, Colorado
Servin' secrets you do not know

Hang Time (Boogie Bang Boogie),The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"Bang, bang, boogie
Up jumps the party

I know your name, and the hours that you operate are grave yard
Shift my body weight out the gates
He came, huh, like a thief in the night
This hell hounded off his leash, teeth clenched tight
You might know my face, not the expression that it's left in
When I taste a loved ones blood, my forked tongue
Make sure protect your next of kin
Take it like pain killers
Spill the pills of medicine right down the drain
Flush the evidence then claim your innocence
This shit just isn't their game
In fact, their rules don't apply here
It's a shame that you're going to die here
Underneath my thumb print
All over some dumb shit
Run quick cause you're about to get your punk ass beat in public
Like bang, bang, boogie
He beat down her door with an alibi full of childhood
I killed time while it stood still for her
Moments must have adjusted accordingly, but on his watch
The minutes were fast, giving him whiplash
Beat by the hands of my clock
Lots can happen in an hour
For some days don't fly by, they make a crash landing
I flee by night and only return for emergencies
Just so I can listen to the ambulance sing
Sirens rang, the colors of the flashing lights
Painted the town red in the blackest of nights
So i will not taint beauty in the ugliest of moments
Its that strange side of a poet
I'm writing you out of my will to live and let live
And to give you some perspective, I'm a changed man in that respect
You best get professional detectives and motion detectors to protect your relatives
That's as much warning as your ass will get
I hold my aim, this is an invite to my domain
Pick me up while I hitchhike on memory lane
Sit tight while I back seat drive you insane
And beat your brains until you see nothing but pitch white
And keep you breathing just long enough to have you explain what its like
And how you like it. Convince me
I want to believe
I want to believe that you bleed
I want to believe that you're bleeding
Just as much as she did
I'll experiment with your life until I find it's fucking meaning
You will hang, hang
Bang, bang, boogie
She beat back her attackers with a childhood full of alibis
As I understood, she had to lie
The battle cries must have adjusted accordingly
Her stopped calls for help never were answered back
And for that beat by the hands of my clock
Lots can happen in a matter of seconds
Ask for a repentance from a looking glass
Self shattered reflections
Before you blame your anger on adolescence
Listen to the symphony of ambulances sing
So beautiful
So nice
Tell me where were you last night?
As usual
You lied
Tell me where the fuck you hide
It goes bang, bang, boogie
Up jumps the party
I always notice when she has new marks on her body",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-hang-time-boogie-bang-boogie-lyrics

Inner Conflict,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"I conflict with those who are tricked by the gimmick market and can't think with logic
Logics are in the distance so I'm makin a pop hit hip hop is askin themselves why this kid talks shit
It's just I'm never breakin even so I throw an art fit
Sick of rappers sayin' fresh but stink like armpit and couldn't test a single member that's within our clique
I'll bring it to you right now but you don't really want it
I'm born to the sauce that make ya heart skip, if you rolled as much as you're told you'd get car sick
A constant my pissed off audience is at your concert, sittin in the front row, get wet with what they all spit
I'll be standin in the back hittin ya with a tall stick
I could drown your ass in oil and still ya not slick
Winnin over your fan base make em say ""aw shit""
Right in ya damn face, confidence, you lost it
Now these super thuggy guns say bring that hard shit ... Inner conflict
Simple simple Simon Simon says to sing the pop hit... Inner conflict
Corny white boys just want jokes, this isn't a comic strip... Inner conflict
Still I bring the conflict, I sing of conflict, I'm in a conflict... I'd rather be artistic
Painting pictures with my words while freaking a tar pit, you're broad strokes are filed with lead, so what you're eating's toxic. With this poisonous self destruction you're feeling, stop it
Taking more than god's name in vein making your beating heart quit
Put you on the floor then pull the carpet out from under your feet and watch you drop quick, flying through the airwaves hit you in a drop kick on the WWF wrought his war tip
Run up in your crib and watch that horse trip
Playing healthy mind games that keep her thoughts sick the plot is not the only thing I think is in this porn flick, once I'm done with her you really think she wants your dick?
That's not how I'd rather be
This is not who I would rather be
This is not what I would rather be
I am not lit hittin on some club hoppin' bar chick, I star to flick name dropping on some super star trick, only for the sake of seein her jump on the jock quick simply get that cock trick spit what your mom drip. Back to these bastards who claim they got grip, take your finger off the safety and let your Glock click. Aim for the back of my fist, make it your target, stigmata. I let the blood from my palm drip, I've got to cold and sober(?) socials in the Arctic, I'll single-handedly rip through your family make it look like a mob hit, better stiff it if your biscuit got limp, I'll go down head first like Fred Durst for a hot lick of this lollipop stick
Sick of suckers thinking they can balk it. Hip-hop rip offs over a guitar lick. That little bitch has slit his wrists with his guitar pick. I stick to my convictions, it don't make me a convict, I compliment only those who deserve the prospect, never tried the chronic chucked the tire tonic, not your normal human assuming I'm bionic, bout to blow up listen to my inner time bomb click

I Trusted You,Sick Of Wasting,2009.0,"Here is a really brilliant new talent, a singer of such rare distinction, that we simply had to share him with you, it's an honor to welcome to the stage, the gifted...
“Mr Sage... Mr Sage... Shoot, I'm looking for a man named Sage”

You know, it's been like 20 years I've been doing this, shit. Came up with a lot of people, a few of which fell the fuck off. So I'mma dedicate this to y'all
Pieces of shit who disappear when the campaign fades
Got a nice little record but you can't play on stage
I anti-promote you so I can't say your names
You're crying about money with your brand name shades
You tint out the window to your bland brain waves
You couldn't see us move past the champagne phase
I done changed the game while your fans stayed the same
And say, ""Shoot. I'm looking for a man named Sage.""

I trusted you (x 16)

Listen, don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things
And don't forget to hit the deck when ma' machete swings
It's a rage that engages when the celly rings
You don't gotta interrupt my life just to tell me things
I don't get along with self-help book worms
Had a ring of 'em around me and they all took turns
With looks of concern while taking what they could get
Some parasitic, bloated tick, opportunistic bullshit
My little one-trick pony
You had a good run while I was patting your ass but after that
All anyone could say is how you're so down to earth
So is dog shit. Both are getting left in the dirt

I trusted you (x 8)
No, it ain't about the lie, it's how you tell me it
I'll slap this hatchet in your back before we bury it
Then spit out your cherry pit
Your petty shit goes tits up. I'm like, ""Man, whateva.""
You're all like, ""What is your damage, Honey?""
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw. Just make sure
You lube up with salt solution, stupid, I'm a take it raw
There's canker sores on the lip service you give me
Your facial flaws are gettin' all nervous and shifty
Sissy. That's an easy tell
Consider the elbow grease that I put in when you get jealous of what you see me sell
How'd you fit those big dollar signs in your little beady eyes
Without the use of photoshop or CGI?
I've got a special effect, it's called hard work
I write my own checks, that's just one of my job's perks
You got burnt but you keep playing with matchsticks
Keep falling off like weak refrigerator magnets
Lock and load. Cock and aim
I've got a razor tongue but it's like a taser gun when I make shocking claims
And I don't just talk some game
Cause I'm a commentator and a player and a coach who can fan the flame
Fuck a stand off, I'll chop your hand off
And I'll shove it down your throat until you choke and you can't cough
Dis me in your city if you need to, but when I come through...

""Am I glad to see you Sage!""
""Wow Mr. Sage. You made me wish I could have been there too!""

I said forever?
Forever ever? forever ever ever ever ever ever ever?
Apparently forever only means four year!
This is the rewrite... this right here
This is the rewrite... this right here
This is the re-write, to anyone who has been fucked over in their life
This to the woman who I used to respect
Now I call her a bitch cause I'm constantly upset
So this is to the +bitch+ who cut communication
For a new relation
Selfishness spread through the nation
All I ever wanted was a hug
To wrap my loving arms around you, you blew it off with a shrug
So all I ever wanted was a hand to hold
I ain't the man to scold
Your plan is cold but god damn its old
It's about time get inside of my head while I'm out my mind
As I scream cry yell shout and whine
All I ever asked for
Was an ear to hear me
What you really have to wear that mask for?
You straight shattered my glass jaw
I'm picking up the pieces of my past, what you last saw
But see this, needless to say, you went astray
And all people ever hear Sage say is
I don't give a damn, I don't care
That's what I hear from myself tryin' to make things clear
Yeah, I don't give a FUCK for real I don't FUCKING CARE
You know why?
The pain stops with the end of raindrops
But this cloudy weather just reminds me of the time we spent together
And how you left forever like that with a snap of fingers
Pain lingers, this is to the
Woman who I made my family
Now I call her a bitch just to save my sanity
So this is to that +bitch+
She be right here, a monster in my reoccurring nightmare
Now when my grandfather died
And my grandmother died
And my dad fuckin' died
You saw me and just ignored me like ""Sorry end of the story""
My family's dropping like flies somehow I got to rise
But nobody's by my side, can't look straight into my eyes
Nobody's by my side, look straight into my eyes
My fist grabs air, stare into the lies
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me. This is the thanks that you show me?
I never felt more lonely, I made you the one and only
Individual to know me, never thought that you'd turn phony
But you did, I'm going all out kid
And I got mad hate to deal with
Yo,I'm having trouble letting anyone get close to me
And that's a major problem because that's not the way it's supposed to be
Supposedly, I should keep my composure
Right now, I'm like ""wow"", it's time for me to seek closure
Pictures are destroyed - overexposure
Ever get that feeling that nobody really knows ya'?
This is to the woman who I called my best friend
Now I call her bitch, because she made the switch to that +bitch+
Who I shouldn't disrespect
So now I call her woman just to keep myself in check
Fuck that

She said to me ""the answer's easy if you take it logically""

Dade County
Miami
1976
A baby boy, livin' in a hotel with his parents
Mommy was a maid there
Don't really know what pops did but
He was trainin' to be a locksmith
We moved up the coast
Back to where the grandparents lived
Perhaps for cash
I didn't think to ask as a kid
And I don't where pops went, but things seemed stable
Even when he left his keys on the table
My single mom
She was able to make it without relationships
Every so often, pops would show up and babysit
It never made me think about his day job a lot
Until the day when my mom's changed the locks
In those days
When he watched me, when I think back, in some ways
Made up of coffee, six packs and gun play
Pornography and projects, step siblings and half relatives
But havin' kids is bad for business
Girlfriends were the rage then
Babies in the playpen
Toddlers were forgotten in front of television stations
It wasn't just one way to say things
Between the two households
I out rode all types of combinations
Breakin' these codes and peekin' through key holes
Finger on the pulse, stethoscopes broke the needle
Put my ear to the ground, you hear the pins drop
Gears in the clock
Turned like my stomach turned like the dial on a padlock
Rhode Island was the backdrop
The world was the oyster
Crack the shell, hand the pearl over to the lawyer
In family court I make judgments
I'm a product of my father's trade and my mother's substance
 
I. Feel. A. Little. Apprehensive. Talking to
You you. About. My. Life. With. My. Own. Voice
Although. I. Think. People. Will. Relate. And. Understand

(Yeah sure.)
Yo, check me out, uh
I'm a straight up killer and nobody knows it
I suppose it
Is much better that way, STAY POETIC!
You ain't a killer, oh shit
Keep on believing what seems obvious
It's all for the dollar dollar bill
Holler, until you see 'In God We Trust'
Who do we trust in?
Present day thug mentality
Disgusting
Adjust your chin with a tap to the jaw
It's a must win situation, askin' for war
I'm at your door with a paper shredder
Inserting the ?
Squirting with your mama's sis
Until I start murdering with a harmful kiss
When I *kissing sound*
She feel victim to the charm that I put on
My inner hatred detonated the lip balm
These are fireworks
When desirable flirts higher their skirts
I hold the handle of a Roman Candle inside em, IT HURTS!
Trust me it hurts me more
I'm thirsty for the tasty blood of dirty whores
Ages 34 and under
Whore monger
I've got a hunger
Had a more positive outlook when I was younger
And a much cleaner conscious
Touch my penis with constance
Living life with the ambition to F Venus it's nonsense
I'm a genius of constance and vowel sounds
See I know how it sounds but take your showers now
And throw your towels down
I'll have your bowels drowned in discharge
Have Homer insisting, ""Open your lips Marge!""
While kids watch, I ish you not
I'll have Lisa eating meat again
When we meet again, I'll be the friend
She always wanted but could never have if she'll believe pretend
It'll be the end of her loneliness
I desire only this for her to
Blow me a kiss and hold me with her innocent arms
Let my bloodstained hands touch her untrained glands

And I don't know their looking dead tonight (x3)

What's the RPM of your breath
Kickstart your heart with a punch
Beating your chest
Squeezing your head till I pop vessels in your eye sockets
We talk your ears off till your blood pressure sky rockets
If ? check for lumps in your throat
Before you burn a bridge jump in a moat
Depending on whether you float or sink
Know how to swim or can't
You know what to think before you provoke some shit
Between concentration camp counselors
Giving first aid training
Mouth to mouth recessitate
Lady faint
When I see her face fading
I make her suck wind
Bring her vibrant colors back
See if she has any contacts
And find out where her mothers at
Said she had my number
But nothing other than that
When she said my number's up I laughed
The EMS came running back
Doing suicides the relay race of time
And space between me and destiny
But I leave no trace to find
She leaves nowhere to hide
I leave no hide to wear
Skin myself feed my bones
Dress up in some tribal gear
Mummified every time I lived in the now
If you don't want to die
Then come alive and don't give your number out
Count down till the end of my show
Shout loud if you ain't ready to go

You're fucking with a brother who ain't never had his hand held
And never seemed passed out
Rolling baby strollers over broken floating bottles
In a shredded forest with a dying shred of hope inside you
For this respect, I sweated and bled
And have yet to be discredited by what a critic ever said
We're unaware of his racial make up
We know he's an albino but can't science the face up
Never question what I am
G O D knows if you don't, you can never understand
So you need only know that I'm unrelenting

Cast shadows like light descending

For now, we and Sage Francis connected and did
Damage, uh
Damage, uh
Wrote this one a couple days after Christmas
Hope is one struggled game thats persistent
0 plus 1 2, for Self, no assistance
Pistol clear before this new year existed
Somebody get the door, fuck it, let 'em snore
It's all been said before, buried in a metaphor
Lucy is Hip Hop, and Jacob's a prince
Sean is an old man, and Slug is a PIMP now
They say I'm buggin' because of the way I love 'em
Nervous 'cause I know I'll never make the perfect husband
What, they treat me like LL for art fucks
They hang out and argue about my clown thought and snort rocks
From the twin cities, call it the deuce
Skinny grizzly bear alcoholic on the loose
Sing with me, show your love, give me proof
Flip the switch to damage and make this planet move
Never intended on making records that seemed too slick
Peeps move quick from cheap music to G-UNIT
Weak bullshit pulls chicks, but Joe Beats flosses every day
Ain't he ain't talkin' 'bout my gold teeth
My hobo teeth is no sleep for seeking soulmates
Getting cold feet, if my queen don't awake
My feeble bones break, spines curve

People don't take time to learn outside the pyramids
What the dilly is? I'm unsure, but so sin surr
Get your hurr did, that ain't a perm, yo, that's a temporary
That ain't a wormhole, that's a cemetary where they bury the lies
I'm lampin', I'm cold, cold lampin' out in the snow, campin'

Abused and altered, I just caught you eves dropping
Adam's rising to pluck the fruit from off the branch
Reaching out to touch your inner-drives
Cut me open and count the rings inside to see how long I've been alive
Containing forms of records about the types of storms I've weathered
Leave a stump for kids to carve initials as long as I'm remembered
But lessons go forgotten plus you don't believe a thing
Listening to the whispering of my leaves in the wind
When the breezes begin you're just concerned with flying kites
Till I tangle up your child's play and get you climbing heights
Still reluctant to hear me out admiring the sites
You have no idea what it was like being nailed to Christ
You're swinging from the twigs and limbs that used to hang your siblings
Have respect you selfish self-centered sack of man-made buildings
I was the original pinnacle but now I'm nothing to you but kindling
Tickling my inhibitions of naturally attracting children
Who have a funny idea of what forever is
I witnessed the first time lips kissed with stripped innocence
Not too long after that was I supplying shade
For a man caressing silverbacks trying to get laid
Monkeying around and now they're all dying of A. I. D. S
Government guerilla tactics? That's a farce, I bring the plagues
Cancer? That's just icing on the cake, I nurse and feed ya
Cause you drained me of my sap with taps of perverse procedure
I hold your family background right down to the first amoeba
Watched you grow from just crustacean to a land mammal, it hurts to leave ya
But I've had enough, and it'll be very relieving
Just who do you think supplies the air you're breathing?
Humongous oxygen tanks? As if it's all free
Constantly wondering where your dogs are at?
They're barking up the wrong tree
Wanting proof of identification but I existed before fingerprints
Cognitive dissonance... I hear chainsaws in the distance
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there to hear it
Does it make a sound? I'll go down quietly but you'll feel it
Still these sick like thoughts keep eating away at my inside
Till I'm nothing but hollowed out hide..
The dead tree's still standing, here comes the hunting-ax of lumberjacks
So I attract like lightning when the thunder cracks, I'm under attack
So I may finally... stop... stumble... relax...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-tree-of-knowledge-lyrics

I paid you a compliment, you asking about money too much

Keep her gums from flapping

And bust a fucking backspin
On her north face
Turn this court case into a dragged out lawsuit

I heard the guy cums quick from hand speed
I’m a have to fertilize his stomach with my man seed
Implant trees
My broccoli crop needs watering
Cry your eyes out above my rotting crotch and feed it awful things

Pop the erection

That I dropped into my living hell
The seemingly indestructible knuckles of my fists are clean
Keeping eyes wide open and bulging out like Mr. Bean
Misdemeanors made to look like felonies, the prison queen
Is existing in his own filth and feeling no guilt it seems
It's a dream with cheetah speed we're chasing after
Some are running quick
Track teams want me to lead but face the fact
Y'all can't catch up to it, pace at your own pace on this race track
You'll eventually get lapped on your last leg while stretching my aggression is just a lack of serotonin
Plug the jack of your telephone in to the wall
So I can call your bluff just to say what's up, how ya doin'
Now I've ruined the beautiful sound of silence
Won't get quiet until the voices in my head come down with laryngitis
Talking, talking, talking, talking, so much to say, so little sense to make
Bedposts get chopped off once innocence gets raped
Close the curtains and drapes, pull down the blinds
Cover your ears, block your nose and mouth, shut your eyes
There's a black box in my head, which is actually red
When I crash and burn it keeps a record of every last word I said
It goes ""one"" for the finger fuck, ""two"" for the peace sign
(3 strikes, you're out)
Casey's at bat with unloaded guns in his mouth
 
As the day grows old
We pave this road
When we take control
We will save your soul

And it burns just like that famous ring of fire
Sing to inspire, try to loosen up the dirt that clings to the tires
Establish some traction, lingering behind the curtain of satisfaction
I'm certain of nothing, Mr. Knew it all
Late for my disorientation, fate glued to the wall
The pain felt could make the brain melt
Heard the shackles on the ankles, mistook the sound as slay bells
Remember that song called big pimpin' ?
It made me want to dance around but I had no type of rhythm
Then I thought I should write a song called sick pimpin'
Cause I know a lot of beautiful psycho inspiteful women
Now I'm that cat that tiptoes on his pads
With the gauze on track and so as not to cause damage
Hello, Miss Management, time decision making process
Trying to catch the breath I couldn't find 'til I lost it
Stand upon a rock I couldn't climb if I tried
With a fist full of issues, a bag full of pride
Well alright, I'ma write all the problems on the board
If anyone can answer 'em, I'll let them drive my Ford
I quit searching for the truth cause the truth can change
It all depends on how the furniture's arranged
If you don't take a moment to sit in the chair
Then there wasn't any point of ever puttin' it here
And I'm lovin' every minute as the day gets vivid
While I'm twistin' up the lyrics of existence
And it goes, ""one"" for the wife and ""two"" for the house
(Three strikes, you're out)
Now please remove my life from your mouth
 
As the day grows old
We pave this road
When we take control
We will save your soul",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-day-grows-old-lyrics
Broccilude,Human the Death Dance,2007.0,"That's dope
That's fresh
That's dope
That's fresh
That's dope
That's fresh
That's fresh

This is what broccoli is all about

And the way you boil broccoli, it's texture, and the green
Color is so wonderful... I'm simply amazed.. as a housewife right now

Why don't you serve this to president George Bush? You know, he once told the press that he wasn't too crazy about broccoli, and it actually made the news!

I never imagined broccoli can be put together with something sweet like
This, and the yogurt is not so overpowering either

I think he went to the extent of being a, well you could say, evangelist of
Broccoli, like an ambassador of sorts. That's his greatness, really",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-broccilude-lyrics
I Keep Calling,UnKnown,UnKnown,"AUTHOR: Sage Francis
Chorus
Intro:
Pick up, Pick up...Pick up, Pick up...
Verse One:
Now I can't even think back. Self-induced amnesia has made its impact /
Mental health produced at leisure was frayed once it was intact /
I voluntarily refuse to remenisce /
If I could choose any wish...I'd lose my genesis /
And prove to my nemesis that I don't need Memory Lane on my way home /
But I got lost and I needed a pay phone /
Because I was in an unsafe zone...inside of a place unknown /
Where unfamilliar faces roam (...and it's so strange)... /
I've got no change...I could've sworn that I did when I left /
My breath gets heavy with every lie and theft /
I looked right and left...then I called people at my home collect /
To tell them, ""Things changed."" But they just won't accept /
I'm out of range...with no respect. Every time I asked for directions /
All I got was dead air, cut lines, and bad connections /
People who would help changed their number to unlisted /
411 info left me unassisted. Wickedly twisted... /
Incidents. Is it coincidence? I choose to think so /
Deep in thought, my eyes blink slow. Pictures appear like slide shows /
My mind knows each and every single detail /
Total recall is leaving me pale /
Sick to my stomach...nautious...forces of nature bring my homing instinct /
Its stink...is so distinct...now let me think...a minute /
Epiphany: This is the much traveled trail from my past /
Now an unbeaten path...unfunny memories are now making me laugh
Chorus
Verse Two:
Haaaaaa! The flashbacks of my past acts are numerous /
Since out the uterus...Earth encounters ain't been that humerous /
Heheheheh...my laugh lines have been faked for the last time /
I'm past my prime. Climaxing again is a task of mine /
I'm homeward bound. Break out the map and atlas /
I ask gas station attendants...and they just act pissed /
I'm black listed...for not staying true to white lies /
I fight lies...in darkness...heartless...until the night dies /
Then I shed some light on what's the matter /
Reflections in the looking glass self scatter when the hard stares make it shatter /
7 years bad luck? Time's irrelevant /
I'm searching for signs of intelligent minds, but find the element /
Which blinds what the hell I think. Now I'm thinking... /
""What time is it?"" I see the 12:00 blinking /
Check the position...of the sun...to see there is none /
I figure there's an eclipse...so I look away to save my wisdom /
The solar system left me stranded in a universe /
Where I do reverse psychology. Apologies are made through my verse /
Ain't nothing to do but curse when I'm frustrated /
Making people disgusted. Plus, I'm mistrusted and hated /
That's an understatement, but who really cares about my failure years? /
I'm on an expedition...following my trail of tears /
From when I cried, but...it dried up...and vaporized /
I played your game, so where's my consalation prize? I'm taking lies /
From faking guys...and gals...who want to be my pals...and peers /
At this here pace, it'll take me a thousand years /
To fins my way back...encompassing what they lack /
It cost me most of my life, but still I'm thinking about a pay back /
Decapitated...I lost my head, and fear is activated /
I'm in a fog. My blood, sweat and tears evaporated /
I back track to find my lost sense of direction /
Stop, look, and listen...before I cross the intersection /
There's much construction. I'm signaled with morse code /
To take a detour. Somehow I end up on an off road /
I squint my eyes...trying to find some street signs /
I can only read strong thoughts. These people have weak minds /
Trapped in a desert that to me looks like a sandbox /
With damn NARCS...hold up, son...I'm noticing some landmarks /
I rack my brain...knowing that I can't attack in vane /
Upon return I promised myself not to act the same /
But every so often my selective screen memory...will be my enemy /
Metamorphasize and say, ""Remember me?"" /
Getting me petro...wish I could kill the retro /
But heck no...to much of my past I just can't let go /
I'm just a stone's throw away from my home turf...which really is this whole earth /
But claims like that have no worth /
Epiphany: And then it hits me...the reason why I'm dizzy /
Is because I've been traveling in circles keeping myself busy
(Where is he?)

Mutiny,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Friends....How man does Sage have now?
Let me count 'em down with one hand
Thought we'd atleast keep peace we've been growing change together
Instead I'm Strange forever
Who's Sage he ain't too clever
Perverted introvert who gets hurt in rainy weather
Rearrange his brain and make the pain get better
The dungeons of his dome gots whips, chains, and leather
Cold souls get blacker, blood stains get redder
Shame on whoever
Foils is the ranged endeavor ??? didn't agree with the outcome but complaining never
Its all about me concentrating on the meta-physical and spiritual
Whats her name, forget her, but uh
Didn't take too much for me to remember don't ever expect to be apart of my daily agenda
I won't expect a letter come the month of November
If it happens then it happens, and uh, I let you enter at your own risk
Back into my life from the mutiny - stupidly - you gave up on you and me

Me and you might reunite
But it won't be tonight
Cause I don't really need you right
Keep your weak crew tight
Cause as we lose light I still have the ability to see true sight
Me and you might reunite
But it won't be tonight
Cause I don't really need you right
Keep your weak crew tight
Cause as we lose light I still have the ability...
Some say it ain't cool what I say
Cool, is what I say to helps me keep my cool
Anyway I be a fool
Till the day that I die say friends of mine
Others say I have the most genius mind until the end of time
Both sides are correct on being incorrect
They'll agree to disagree upon my intellect
When you intersect parallel lifelines
You create angles which mangles up the nice time
I'm quite calm when you consider the mean
Meaning the average, because my savage personality is unseen
One's dream is everyone else's nightmare
I'm sick of cheating souls who wanna battle, don't fight fair
I'm like where, right here
Right when, right now
Right why, cause I'm not the type to lie
Now let me wipe my eye, cause I don't like to cry in public
Try to object but you can't defy the subject
Wipe off your girl's lipstick, then I hit quick
Cause mental ??? bitch
This kid's slick
That ain't nothing but is it
Making life or death decisions in an instant when I think quick
Think fast when I cock back my pen and let the ink blast
Filled with ever floats your boat ???
You'll be back again
Acting like my friend
Until then, talk shit

See I'm trying to live a dream
While my dreams are reality based
Your mentality
Strictly on a salary chase
You just a charity case
Begging for some sort of flattery, assault and battery
You think you matter to me
You think you madder than me
Lets here you say stuff
Stay tough, you trying to be sand paper but you ain't rough
Get your paint buff cause now I'm editing your lettering
You better bring a muzzle cause you never should have said a thing
Unsettling, emotional, rollercoaster you wish now we were closer
That ain't bout to happen
Back in the day we used to hang out
You shout my name out but now we ain't down
So don't claim clout
You on a lame route shouting ""MUTINY""
You, yourself, and you, me, myself, and I
You and me. me and you might reunite
But it won't be tonight
Cause I don't really need you cracka, yo I don't need you
I don't really need you cracka
I don't need you, I don't really need you",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-mutiny-lyrics
House of Bees,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Birds and the bees
Nerds and mp3s
Surfing the seas of watermarked promo cds that leaked
Like best kept secrets ain't worth art thats physical
Hardcopy material given a proper burial
Long live the satisfaction that songs give
Records in my attic got scratched and haunted
Radio stations that are captured on my tape recorder
A long time listener, first time caller
Hung up for the last time
Nervous and out of breath
My writing had no purpose it was murder and lots of death
Turned to god and turned godless
The audience beneath the surface wanted death
It kept me honest
Truth be told never made a deal with satan
I turned my loose leaf gold
Got a carton full of songs sitting on the counter of a store
Shut them down now
Only looseys sold
I said
What the hell we gonna do now?
How many units can we move now?
They wanna make money money
But there's a limit when you keep taking honey from the house of bees
A lot of shit is out of tune since the weather started changing
The flowers are confused don't know when they're pollinating
They bloom before the frost get caught depopulation
Ripple effect the systems connect the scene started changing
Bees stop behaving in a way that made sense
Queens disrespected while the babies raid the nest
No defense the record store is under attack
The dj's a complete hack but none of y'all beeswax
The colony collapse when the label got sued
For the pollen on the track now its losing value
The music press the publicist deluded bad review
They plundered and ask but nothing but the hunger to consume
Mass produce mass appeal manufacture junk products
Static loops lack the real so the fans would rather shoplift
Sold the whole thing and forgot what it was
Now you got no sting and you're trying to start a buzz
Like
What we gonna do now?
How many units can we move now?
They wanna make money money

Keep taking honey from the house of bees",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-house-of-bees-lyrics

Is this hip hop or a starbucks coffee shop
This is xaul zan, I'll show you how I do it in my neck of the woods
It's like...
You don't have to write a poem
I guess I just hate MCs who act like they're groggy
Grab the microphone
And resuscitate the life of the party
I got a right to be cocky
The girlies want me bad
Throw my blows and hockey dads give me herpes
I'll be mad
You turkeys lolly-gag, emitting the worst stench
I got your mommy gagged
And she's sitting on my workbench
Handed her a wrench
I let her work my nuts a bit
To have her thirst quenched
Yeah I let her take another sip
For the fuck of it I freaked the funk on 45s
Silly suckers think I'll sit just listening to all their jive
I'm the sort of guy to cook your family fix for dinner
I'll make your daughter cry when she wakes up
With some fingers in her
Listen to lynyrd skinner
I'll sell your pretty heart
Now let's tittyfuck while I get naked like iggy pop
She sees my mini-cock
She wants no small man
Runnin around the city block, yellin out...
It's Xaul Zan!
I sip from a tall can and take big gulps
The dodgeball champ, I'm the reason why your kid sulks
Feeding the shit out adults
Ripping the deeds to your house
And I'ma fuck you in your face till you bleed out your mouth

I've been a mental patient
I've been a parental replacement
For kids sent to the basement

I've become best friends with a pen and pad
Understanding the logic of an inanimate object
Standing in the projects with a sign around my neck
Saying ""Show me my respect!""
They thought it as a setup, upset
I've been unusual
I've been an unusual suspect
You're beautiful, just check
To make sure that you're musical on set
I'll be back in a minute
React to the limit
And find out if ya act offended
Asking me if you can kick it?
I said ""No you may not.""
Cause your flow just ain't hot
So you busters stay shy
What the fuck do they got?
Watch your mouth. What'd that bitch say?
That went way out
No doubt hit by the ricochet

He'll think that it's custom
I'll tell him that he's Muslim every Christmas
So on December 25th he'll be giftless
Then I'll convince this dumbass
He's actually a witness of Jehovah
Flip mat sheets on the sofa
Have him bring fat chicks on over
Give em drinks if they're sober

Who walks bare footed in a bad land
I've been to Madison
""What's up?"" to my Boston heads
I came to visit y'all
But you know me I got lost instead
I toss in bed
Keep myself awake at night
Worried that I might not fall asleep
Until I see the light
My friends wanna see me fight
Cause I'm a Black Belt Karate Master!
I'd rather have my freestyle raps
Sale the party's laughter
Plus I'm out of shape
And haven't trained in months
Can't count how many times

I'm feeling cranial lumps
They made you a chump
I left you walkin a course of

It's rest that I probably lack

Rollin through the plaza asking

Welcome to my life (welcome)
Welcome to my life (welcome)
Welcome to my life where everybody wants to cipher
They've never held a mic, but they swear they nice
Â€˜cause they boys told â€˜em so
And surely enough they suck my dick in front of they girlfriend like
Â€œLook, this is how you do it, you gotta f**kin' do it slow then fast, slow then fast
Eat that shitâ€, check-check
If this is you, you're not alone
This world's a rock of drones
Girls flock like birds
Cause they heard lots of poems from the mystery man
When my name gets spit it echoes
Straight-laced people say grace with evil smiles
I'll stick to Velcro
Let go of these claims I hold true
This is Sage, don't say I ain't told you
Fake gold tooth
Real problems with garden gnomes who talk shit
My respect's the best bargain known to the consumin' market
So pay me it
To my love-hate relationship with love-hate relationships
Makes me rich
My old lady thinks that I done did it
But I done didn't
Save my breath during dramatic movie endings hold the stub of the ticket
When credits roll I'm heading for the exit hole
Your track record is such a short shelf-life bless its soul
It's about you, all about you
That's probably why you don't really respect it or know how to
F**k a fickle fan base, stuck a middle finger in they damn face
Does the pinnacle of my hand taste dirty like the suggestive gesture

Get murdered by stress and pressure, pressure-cooker

Think he was so very special among the hundred thousand
You play the fence, your flow is weak and your concepts suck
It makes no sense, slow to speak â€"" your logic's f**ked
You made no dents over beats that got lots of cuts
Noise you do have toys like you stocked with Tonka Trunks
You're not a lone, this world's a rock of drones
Who rock microphones and abuse generous ears
With the â€œyeah, yeah . . . off the domeâ€
You're not a lone, this world is stocked with clones
And my dear Watson's are coming to bite a style near you

Zero (Demo),Sick to D(eat)h,2014,"Check it out here!
If it wasn't for the bass, I wouldn't need these hearing aids
If it wasn't for mistakes, I probably wouldn't be here today
10 years ago I was 22. 20 years ago I was 12. 30 years ago I was 2
When I came out my momma I was zero
In the before life...I was undead
I was home schooled. There were no rules
But I gave it all up just for the chance to go public
A celestial scarecrow dancing with the puppets
A tug in my gut. I'm carrying the world in my stomach
I'm a surrogate motherfucker, the girls love it
Birth the suffix. Cut the visible string
Control is much more than a physical thing
Got an analog God and digital king
An Adonis type bod with such brittle little wings
I'm not an angel by any stretch of your halo
But I've done the Lord's work and I'm not even on his payroll
I stay low and do my dirt on a sea level
Shoo away the crow while you flirt with the she-devil
Grow up. You're old enough to know that dreams falter
I propose you leave that ego at the alter
The pauper and the prince switch roles
Exchanging tattered clothes and silk robes
The man behind the curtain at the end of the yellow brick road
Shows envy for Geppetto and his one inch nose
If it wasn't for the bass, I wouldn't need these hearing aids
If it wasn't for mistakes, I probably wouldn't be here today
When I came out my momma I was zero
I was zero when I came out my momma, now everybody knows…
I was born into it and before I knew it
I saw the students of poor getting hauled off to war
It's the law of Judas in the land of king's tax
Partake in the Eucharist and then demand your kick backs
Spiritual wrist slap, please pass the sacrament 
Ask if big, bad, black Jesus was African
They're selling a click track but they call it a soul clap
It's all in how you package it. The power of a magic trick
Immaculate concepts are lost in the land of the cross
I'm standing off with a man of the cloth
He knows the ins and outs. All I want is the outs
He's selling real estate for some place in the clouds, but...
I'm not investing in intellectual property
I'm inventing gender bending technology
'Cause maybe everybody needs to just become a sexual oddity
Leaving birth to the test tubes and death to the lottery
There's no one stopping me, I've got to be self-regulating
Wealth is escalating but my poverty was entertaining
Now I'm debating the value of a caste system
Cash back rewards and wars funded by my taxed income
If I'm a part of the problem then pardon me
There's always been a difference between what I am and what I wanna be
It's either Jihadist freak or Jesus scenester
I heard God is coming...and she's a screamer
I couldn't understand what she was telling me
Why everybody thinks that they're their own worst enemy
I followed the manual. I swallowed the skeleton key...
And it unlocked the hell in me
So this is my gift to God.  Ribbon on my dick, like a tourniquet. Syphilis
This is my gift to God.  I'm jumping out the cake. Naked with a shank
This is my gift to God.  Unwrap the package. Confetti made of maggots
This...is my gift. ""Ugh, you call that talent? ""

Dirty Mac,The Known Unsoldier...Sick Of Waging War,2001,"Your girl's been spending lots of time at my place
I been helpin her remove the makeup from her fine face
Telling her to go ""Au Natural""
And she trust me cause I'm your pal, thats my style
(Vrooom) I drive the Dirty Mac truck
Convincing her to drink that whole 30 rack up
I sit until I think your girly's mad drunk, then I turn the dirty mac up
What you and her, we shacked up
Well that sucks, we been getting close lately
Special time adds up so don't hate me
It's all about bologna draperies, beef sticks, and meat curtains
Monthly afternoons of bloody hatchet wounds and grease purses
I'm the salt in her pepper, the hop in her steppa
The broccoli in her mi-douth, but she don't want no chedda
(She don't want no chedda?) Naw she want somethin betta
I'd like to thank you homes you the reason why I met her

Days Grow Old,Sick of Waiting Tables,UnKnown,"Build up your saliva and get ready to kill the fire
Spit in the face of figure heads, give 'em a taste of the shit I said
Build a place for children to escape
The inbred human race of living deadbeat
Dads milking the motherless childcare system
Let the sleepers have another nightmare from Christian conservatives
They don't fight fair and any religion would murder kids
If they don't quite care about the condition
Of the prison where we're serving bids
Once I escape my skin cell I won't be banging on the bars of soap
That I dropped into my living hell
The seemingly indestructible knuckles of my fists are clean
Keeping eyes wide open and bulging out like Mr. Bean
Misdemeanors made to look like felonies, the prison queen
Is existing in his own filth and feeling no guilt it seems
It's a dream with cheetah speed we're chasing after
Some are running quick
Track teams want me to lead but face the fact
Y'all can't catch up to it, pace at your own pace on this race track
You'll eventually get lapped on your last leg while stretching my aggression is just a lack of serotonin
Plug the jack of your telephone in to the wall
So I can call your bluff just to say what's up, how ya doin'
Now I've ruined the beautiful sound of silence
Won't get quiet until the voices in my head come down with laryngitis
Talking, talking, talking, talking, so much to say, so little sense to make
Bedposts get chopped off once innocence gets raped
Close the curtains and drapes, pull down the blinds
Cover your ears, block your nose and mouth, shut your eyes
There's a black box in my head which is actually read
When I crash and burn it keeps a record of every last word I said
It goes ""one"" for the finger, fuck, two for the peace sign
3 strikes, you're out, Casey's at bat with unloaded guns in his mouth
As the day grows old
We pave this road
When we take control
We will save your soul
And it burns just like that famous ring of fire
Sing to inspire, try to loosen up the dirt that clings to the tires
Establish some traction, lingering behind the curtain of satisfaction
I'm certain of nothing, Mr. Knew it all
Late for my disorientation, fate glued to the wall
The pain felt could make the brain melt
Heard the shackles on the ankles, mistook the sound as slay bells
Remember that song called big pimpin'?
It made me want to dance around but I had no type of rhythm
Then I thought I should write a song called sick pimpin'
'Cause I know a lot of beautiful psycho inspiteful women
Now I'm that cat that tiptoes on this pads
With the gauze on track and so as not to cause damage
Hello, Miss Management, time decision making process
Trying to catch the breath I couldn't find 'til I lost it
Stand upon a rock I couldn't climb if I tried
With a fist full of issues, a bag full of pride
Well alright, I'ma write all the problems on the board
If anyone can answer 'em, I'll let them drive my Ford
I quit searching for the truth 'cause the truth can change
It all depends on how the furniture's arranged
If you don't take a moment to sit in the chair
Then there wasn't any point of ever puttin' it here
And I'm lovin' every minute as the day gets vivid
While I'm twistin' up the lyrics of existence
And it goes, one for the wife and two for the house
Three strikes, you're out
Now please remove my life from your mouth
As the day grows old
We pave this road
When we take control
We will save your soul",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-days-grow-old-lyrics
Tree of Knowledge (spoken word),Sick to D(eat)h,2014,"I'm a construct of your world, deep-rooted, polluted and tortured
Abused and altered, I just caught you eves dropping
Adam's rising to pluck the fruit from off the branch
Reaching out to touch your inner-drives
Cut me open and count the rings inside to see how long I've been alive
Containing forms of records about the types of storms I've weathered
Leave a stump for kids to carve initials as long as I'm remembered
But lessons go forgotten plus you don't believe a thing
Listening to the whispering of my leaves in the wind
When the breezes begin you're just concerned with flying kites
Till I tangle up your child's play and get you climbing heights
Still reluctant to hear me out admiring the sites
You have no idea what it was like being nailed to Christ
You're swinging from the twigs and limbs that used to hang your siblings
Have respect you selfish self-centered sack of man-made buildings
I was the original pinnacle but now I'm nothing to you but kindling
Tickling my inhibitions of naturally attracting children
Who have a funny idea of what forever is
I witnessed the first time lips kissed with stripped innocence
Not too long after that was I supplying shade
For a man caressing silverbacks trying to get laid
Monkeying around and now they're all dying of A. I. D. S
Government guerilla tactics? That's a farce, I bring the plagues
Cancer? That's just icing on the cake, I nurse and feed ya
Cause you drained me of my sap with taps of perverse procedure
I hold your family background right down to the first amoeba
Watched you grow from just crustacean to a land mammal, it hurts to leave ya
But I've had enough, and it'll be very relieving
Just who do you think supplies the air you're breathing?
Humongous oxygen tanks? As if it's all free
Constantly wondering where your dogs are at?
They're barking up the wrong tree
Wanting proof of identification but I existed before fingerprints
Cognitive dissonance... I hear chainsaws in the distance
If a tree falls in the forest and nobody's there to hear it
Does it make a sound? I'll go down quietly but you're feel it
Still these sick like thoughts keep eating away at my inside
Till I'm nothing but hollowed out hide..
The dead tree's still standing, here comes the hunting-ax of lumberjacks
So I attract like lightning when the thunder cracks, I'm under attack
So I may finally... stop... stumble... relax...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-tree-of-knowledge-spoken-word-lyrics
The Masters Are Back (Non-Prophets),Sickly Business,UnKnown,"By the time the flags rotted off of their antennas
They were questioning who the real threat is
Big Brotherly love is the 21rst Century's plague
No matter how bloody the glove, question evidence displayed
Don't forget what two plus two equals
Don't let them upgrade your math no matter what they have as proof of evil
Remember when they went after the Jewish people?
You don't recognize that same black mask as see through?
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
F**k what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed and a house that wasn't haunted
I'd rather die for a cause than to die just because
We exhaust natural resources forced into wars
Restoring wasteful ways, keeping other countries poor
""Monkey see, Monkey do"" I wonder what those f**king monkeys saw
Keep rethinking the still-frames in your mind
And guarantee they will change with time
Your outline is pixelated with poor resolution while
Downtime is simply wasted. You were born execution style
Head first in a trial. I'll second the motion
'Til the jury's bored to death and puts your neck in a notion
The situation's volatile. A naked problem child
Is trying to find the right clown costume to make his father smile
So he bombs while he tries to tell jokes
This ain't a false alarm, can't you smell the smoke?
You're in the line of fire where they buy and sell votes
Our sense of liberty doesn't ring true, stupid, that's why the bell broke
Trench coat Mafiosos propel rocks
At recruitment officers and rebel against cops
'Til they hurdle infinite circles in small cell blocks
Turtle upon turtle 'til they're all shell shocked
This so-called president got elected in a court room
With the war efforts of pops he inherited a fortune
We ""talk, talk, talk..."" so the veterans of war assume
The revolution stopped. This ain't a protest tune
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their f**kin' skin decays.""
You can't roam a lost land as the last existing dinosaur
There's no escaping ass kickings in these times of war
Replacing apples with hospitals...where doctors are hostile
Killing two pterodactyls with one fossil
I got you. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in it's bald head
F**k what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...and house that wasn't haunted
Thumb through novels to have your fingerprints match
The description of criminals committing innocent acts
Of compassion for tired civilians crawling with pistols
While we fire million dollar warning missals
Force the issues in the back of your head where eyes roll
Brain wash yourself out of that mind control
Or act a fool like you're told
But we won't see no type of justice 'til that bitch removes the blindfold
This ain't a ""Love it or leave it,"" it's a ""Change it or lose it.""
I'll never sing the anthem of a nation who never faces the music
Chasing an ever-elusive caveman
In space ships that makes trips to the futures that are name-brand
Faking progress...but we ain't advanced
Enough to change the posture of our ape stance?
They've got the key to the city but they prefer the break-in entry
Duck and weave, I'm shedding light in their shadow box to make it empty
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their f**kin' skin decays.""
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
F**k what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...
There's nothing scarier than the human stories I tell ghosts
Chilling accounts with my tongue frozen to bed posts
The catharses of carcasses whenever threats are close
Shows a heartlessness that doesn't register on stethoscopes
Sell your hopes for a homeland security chart
'Til your sense of self is broke and no man's pure in the heart
Preventive detention for the folks who never left home
Tensions have grown into a 24/7 red zone
Scare tactics...have got you under control
The fear factors of a color code. The uppers know
They can't hold you down without having anchors attached
""It's all the same."" Nah, balls and chains on ankles don't match
So drag your torso back to the off road
We may have lost the fashion battle but we ain't lost the wardrobe
Go window shopping for your next free meal
'cause when we start the revolution all you'll probably do is steal
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave

She's runnin'
Feet swollen
He's commin'
She's stolen
And before he even knows it she's gone
Tea cups sittin' on the hollow tree stumps
He's dumped, and can't seem to swallow these lumps
The best goes on...
Same fire
New passion
Old flame
Trade it in for a summer fling
There's nothing like that sweet old song...
Tip over
Root the trees
Bend the leaves
Blend in with the open wound
The freeze frames keep him warm...
The day's frost is scrapped off the weight loss
The new sign that says keep off
As he speeds off into the storm...
Out of sight the lighting strikes him twice
He's peeking out on the pike and cheatin life
Pealing out on the lawn
Now he's idling
In his mind he's figuring out life's about the little things
His time is dwindling
And his labyrinth
And all his magnificent can only keep the mike straps
The princess is innocent
She doesn't belong...
(I never thought I'd miss you)
They had a ceremony where he put her in a bridle, the headstall...
She stop to think for a minute, and in a split second went a wall
(I never thought I'd miss you)
He draws in the chin as in a expression of resentment or scorn
He's pullin' on the rains, the bridle, the shower the storm
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war...
The rains, the bridle, the shower, the storm...
The maze, high tower, clouds are at war...
The rains, the bridle, the shower, the storm...
The maze, the high tower, clouds are at war, clouds are at war, clouds are at war...

Sage francis:
The weak link is quivering, determining the chain's strength
Wimpering, vibrating! the wave length of its stress signals are more or
Less symbols. it just trembles
Knowing it'll take the weight when the chain breaks and disassembles
See, mr. wendell? he knew nothing of this daily struggle
Sit under the disfunctional family tree and prepare for trouble
Could barely hear the mumbles beneath the ear-piercing rumbles
Sharp tongues slashing mouths while lashing out with verbal belt buckles
Friends crumble under similar circumstances within their own chain of events
From sloppy knots in family ties. the pain is intense
The tension is thick. two sided arguments are upsetting to him
Stretching the link, testing its endurance and spreading it thin
Trembling, holding onto what's ""familia,"" in the italian sense, i'm reading intense drafts of sylvia plath
Before breaking off into an unfamilliar path
Faking coughs, divert the hurt by trying to act silly and laugh
Making light of situations when i sense a panic attack
I'm a fully licensed self-defense machanic, and my toolbelt is black
She probably thinks i'm dead. she's probably dead
When he left she said i was so strong, but i know she's wrong
I need back support, my knees fold
Please hold your end of the bargain when i leave home
Please hold the keystone
Sixtoo:
How far will he travel?
The essential interpretation watching the sequential falling of the dominos
Which one will stay erect? a microcosm where every effort is just that
It's just maps, papercuts, and the photos to prove the strength
He followed the family, alone as the next member
California dreaming of moving out there in september
I sit in admiration, knowing that the weakest link
Is also the one that holds the pillars on the brink
Of collapse. relapse is the replay of emotional disarray
Sustaining the stains of teardrops on his t-shirt
Sometimes, taking for yourself is harder than giving
Those who want to give up, living in the circumstance
Dance around the issues of dealing with the problem
Drudging through the uncomfortable streets of dispairity
All's fair in love and clarity
And also ignorance
Chains don't always hold the fingerprints
Sole:
Their hearts pump pure, and then sweaty palms tellin' lies
So blame it on a drug-addict, brother, and the cover-up
One can't help become center of attention
When everything is helpless, be realistic
Ever since the goldfish died, daughter can't see past the make-up
Stapling, ""please become a savior to everything.""
Photo album catalog, better order new hand holders
Follow the odor to someone older and less experienced
The whole choir is off key and forgets the words
So ask later and get a free subscription to a diary
Not even worth reading
There was a time like this when mother's tears turned lakes and grew tree gardens
Now overgrown, with homemade grapes
But at least she can keep the whole family together

You could never adapt to my habitat
With a third eye that's got a cataract
And a blurs mind that thing's if you have a gat
You automatically have superb rhymes
Kick to the curb when I'm kicking a battle rap
Land is what you are riding a Cadillac
Lying about being a star (huh) is that a fact
I've got my name on my credit card like Darryl Mack
But rhymes about a car, money,or power is whack

Saul Williams had all civilians think that ish was phat
Leaping tall buildings for small children still missing 
Find them and bring em back
Rewind it and sing it black

Cause you're from knowing jack
They're like a poetry like Kerouac

You don't have no back
So don't front like when you're  attack
I keep involved like a DJ Shadow track
Cut you up like a poor man's sample

Before we drop rhymes like an anvil
Too hot to handle too cold to grip
Plus what you say is rubbish so why you holding it
Trust that you'll get punished
The microphone I grip will bust in your face from some ish
You've got a swollen lip
I've been know to flip  and be wild since the days I was breastfed
Till I'm old and sick and senile and laying in my deathbed
With a broken hip, no teeth from my smile while my chest bled
I freestyle about being left for dead
Now I'm one breath ahead

Threewrite (Non-Prophets),Sickly Business,UnKnown,"This is to the (uh-uh) intertwined souls
The hands I've been trying to hold
This is to the (uh-uh) love that I lost
And all the troubling thoughts of how I got double-crossed
And this is to the (uh-uh) divorce I was forced to settle with
And the remorse I fought off with metal fists
And this is to the (uh-uh) wet, watery kiss I left you with
On your porch while I watched your trembling lips
This is to the... memory of our early years
The first girl I shared feelings with
And it's the realest thing I'd experienced in my short existence
And I ain't afraid to admit
Cause love is one of the things that doesnt come with an age limit
Now does it? In fact I'ma have to say I'm more keen to feel such things
Hopeless things I'd lost in a smokescreen of meaningless fucking
Touching without touching, candles in the dark
Casting shadows on our parents battles, this is for the romantics at heart
It wasn't too long before I held you more then my pen
When I wasn't writing songs, it was something like
""Forever and always, whenever those songs play...""
I remember empty hallways
Or your image that descended from the top floor became an echo
I paid the price for those hard things, and couldn't afford to let go
From a passive debt, I'm past regret
Did you know I dreamt about you before we met?
Remembering our first kiss, and it hasn't even happened yet
Recollecting your set, and I wasn't even given the chance to forget
I guess that's the magic of it
Now every rehashed subject's displaying what I wrote
On cafe napkins to the public
To get it over and done with, closure hath cometh
My shoulders have plummeted from holding these buckets
Hold your laughs till I go back to the tunnels of Paris
Where I wrote half of these paragraphs... but fuck it
This is to my ten year story, in another decade
You better be better prepared for me
In the first four years, you were all ears
Then the next six, you left me for the next exit
With depth to my message
So that began my affair with the world abroad
Behind the curtain with the other hurtful girls I explored
Until I became the monster, turning to the words that I record
Pardon me, if you heard it all before
""I didn't shake you to hurt you""
When you landed on the floor
In a room of naked virtues
I closed my eyes to cancel what I saw
Your hand made the first move to the handle of the drawer
Where the frail girl couldn't think to live
""I didn't shake you to hurt you""
I never planned it before
I can't shake off your perfume, can't wash my hands no more
And I'm breaking my curfew, but I can't walk
I'm standing at the door, I hear the wailing of a little kid
...and the failure of innocence
His compromise eyeing the side of the kitchen sink
What'you think, I just let you cut you, cut me-- cut the bullshit
Damn, I love the hugs enough to tolerate
The way we made each other crazy, making it so tough to operate
Productively, my self esteem didn't help when I felt ugly
And I figured that's the reason why you wouldn't touch me
My ego does bleed, I shouldn't have let you test it
And let your arms free to follow through with your domestic slip up
Love is a battlefield so lick your shots quick
While I lick my wounds and then resume as an obvious target
Infatuations with the past protect my Purple Heart with
A faded picture I had in my shirt pocket
I'm going out with a bang..
In a blaze of glory holes, the anti-hero
I don't care how many ways the story's told
Be careful when these doolies play like drums
And be careful what you say, because my uzi weighs a tongue..
This is to the sleepless evenings that I spent next to grave stones
Hoping someone from beyond would grab my arm and take me home
I hadn't accepted I'd have to make it alone
After feeding everything I had into a payphone
And this is to the rain..
I felt like it was made of spit
My parade was an unbreakable chain of Gabe's trumpets
Save the buckets even though they weighed down my walking
You don't know the height of the steak you place your fork in
You look old (that's what you said)
I feel old (that's what I said)
I been through a lot since you been gone, dead, born again
Torn to shreads over girls who were porcelain
The cry-baby dolls, when we were allowed to talk again
I stopped accepting wake-up calls (that ring true)
I hate the way I fall for everything you do
Our fate is flawed, that's why I make these break-up songs to sing to you
Music is my only psychiatric drug
And you're a pill in human form I'd like to hide under my tongue
Kiss the foot that couldn't fit into the slipper of my mouth
The denizen in your house begging for the benifit of your doubts
When I got kicked out, I played the faithful puppy dog
Loyal to the love alost, sitting at your fucking door in utter disbelief
I sucked all of the skin off of my teeth
You pulled away, you let me choke on your invisible leash
You can find me hiding these screams behind my eyelids
She blinded me (she blinded me) with silence..
So my air-mail lips blew her a fairwell kiss
Slinking over the sink, where all the hair gel drips
Stairwells dip deep into her mouth where I found a cycle
And ever since then, I've been on a downward spiral
This round is final, it's time to recover
Because it's a porch that some dogs choose to die under
The first song was a breakdown, I apologize in round two

An infection can spread to the head if you let it
Don't let it affect the way you think…like ""this is it.""
Oh, this is it? That's all there is for all these kids?

These are heros. Now I call to the heads of State
Recognize greatness when it's in your face
I traveled half the globe to see boys and girls stuck
Without assistance. You insisted on hosting the World Cup?
That ain't love, brother. What happened to you?
You beautified the parts of the city that tourists travel through
You built a gorgeous stadium that can't sustain itself
Flexing superficial muscles in a false display of wealth
Your most important resources need major help
Think of how the medication and information on AIDS is dealt
Beautify the way you save yourself
For God's sake, for human sake, for the sake of public heath
One medicine drop in a bucket eventually evaporates
The socks I bought Zakheni won't fix fractures or breaks
It's not my suffering. It's not my needlessly complex infrastructure
It's not my culture. Nevertheless I see you

Hello ladies and gentleman, thank you for coming here, this time, as opposed to four years ago when I said I was retiring from touring. Now I'm back, fake retirement. The reason why? My accountant let me know I can't leave rap alone. The game needs me. So I created an album called ""Copper Gone"", touring the entire planet, and live a life outside of the place that I've been boarded up for the past four years. If you have any questions let me know, otherwise I'd like to get back to my shit

Uhm, I got love for Florida. I, I have family, I'm from Florida. So, I mean I'll be back, I don't know why shows weren't booked there. I told my booking agent whatever you can get I'll play. So, apparently it didn't work out

You scared of the Dirty South!

*Sarcastically.* I'm scared of the Dirty South. Uhm, well we're playing North Carolina, we're playing Atlanta, it gets...that's dirty right? I don't know, I am kind of scared of the Dirty South

Are you going to play any of the old good stuff?

*Shouting.* Yeah! Epic Beard Men's not a song! (Fuck out of here, out). Uhm, any other questions?

Only two shows in Canada, eh? Doesn't sound like much of a Canadian tour

No, well it's not a Canadian tour, it's a North American tour, so

But no Alaska!?

*Mocking.* No, No Alaska though! Yeah because uhm, (laughing) then I'd have to drive through fucking Canada, eh, to get to you. So, I'd rather not

Sage, you're bringing B. Dolan on this tour, why not bring everybody?

Uhm, I don't, I didn't know I was bringing B. Dolan, that's pretty cool, I thought I was B. Dolan

Sage, no love for Detroit?

No love, that's exactly it, no love

Why don't you play my front porch?

I don't wanna play your front porch, I don't wanna play Detroit, I don't wanna play Florida. I hate Florida. I hate this place. I hate that place. All this shit! I'm only playing the places that I love. That's it from here on out. Which means I'm not playing any place. This is it, this is it, this is...the new press conference, the purpose here, I quit!

I'm having identity crises
""no we're not."" ""yes we are.""
I don't have a feeling that hasn't been felt, feeling on my felt tip
Showing my hand...revealing what i've dealt with
And how i'm dealing. cut the deck. evenly distribute the pieces
Of shit talking during our disputes on weekends
We can sing along to each other's song, right?
Even if the interpretation is wrong, right?
Just make sure you don't bring the wrong mike
'cause i don't care about meeting a boyfriend we can all like (nah!)
This song is called trite, hope ya like it
Could've substituted your name with the title but i decided that i'd keep it private
Violent dream sequences just seem endless
I can see myself making a heated entrance
To your workplace with a smirk on my face
And a tongue in my cheek. and a gun in my reach
Sneaking naked photos of myself under the seats of your co-workers
Putting a knife to your throat and screaming out ""i won't hurt her!""
They're like, ""let her go!""
And i'm like, ""let her grow!""
Prisoners wouldn't listen to this. their rational side was out on a furlough
I like turbo-nuclear family affairs
I want a wife, a house, and two and a half mistresses to call when i'm not there
Then hang up the phone, and have my wife call up the phone company
And ask the phone company guy ""why???""
And he's like, ""ma'am...well, maybe you just don't know how to talk.""
And she's like, ""damn...well...wanna fuck me?""
""yeah of course.""
See? case closed. and he knows how to trace calls
So i can't make cranks saying, ""i hate ya'll!""
I throw baseballs at my mirror, break walls a tear a-
Nother page out of my diary, throwing it from the eighth floor 'til i hear a
Pin drop. unsuspecting pallbearers are in shock
They know i'm about to kill myself with a sling shot
They bring rocks for ammunition
Steal my lifetime magazines and then cancel my subscription
Their hands are just itching to scratch my clean records
My rap sheets are infected, now i can't be president???
I just have to be elected! i ask for just a second chance
The answer back was ""kid, you never did in the first place.""
Speaking of that, give me my blue ribbons back and anything that is mine
Waiting for a nice guy who can't make it to the finish line
When i die you won't recognize the picture buried inside the obituary
But it'll say, ""bye, i miss you very much.""
I'm always one for last words at departing time
In a million years is when this dead star will shine
Say my fuckin' name. nope. say my fuckin' name. nope
You don't...know what to call me so you don't
You don't you don't call me
You don't you don't call me",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-trite-lyrics
Origin To Descent,Sick to D(eat)h,2013.0,"Who confused our economy for the 
Blue Collar Comedy
They got billion dollar jokes and two dollar apologies
That right there, that’s funny
Smack a dummy to fix stupid, looters cash money then git ‘er done
Where will you hide when the revolution comes?
When the banks get ganked and you lose your funds?
When the neck that gets red from the noose that is hung
On the branch of the family tree is your sons
Deadbeats walking livewires in dire times
Risking life and limb to say ‘That ain’t no child of mine!’
While the poor kids try to call dibs from the drinking time that’s all fit from vile faucets
Hide the forests from guys with corporate tax cuts
They claim death is an expense even before the axe struck
I’m actually inspired to have canned goods stacked in my cupboard
Half the world’s on fire the other half is flooded
We let the flames build
We remind ourselves they’re all dead, they’re all gone, they’re all killed
They’re not though
And they rise from the toxins
Running their marathon with no finish line in Boston
We occupied empty fanfare
The waterline was rising and all we did was stand clear
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye
From the origin of species to the descent of man I present this plan
Come from protecting represent this land
If it fails us 
‘c'est la vie’
And if you feel crushed then hate on me
Cause I’mma fly off the handle by the seat of my pants
Hold a fire to my candle try to leave with your hands
See the dance of the flickering flame spark your interest
The answer is simple- plain dark and intent
I won’t invest in reactionary kneejerks
There’s Chinese blood on your Che Guevara t-shirts
‘Me first! Me first!’ mentality gimme gimme
Every single form of government works in theory
I take your life’s deeds and I put em on paper
Apply equations to that shit to make me seem like your savior
Til you all see- nature’s a manmade wasteland
With a God that’s recycled, modernized and replaced again
(Yeah, man)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)
You run from school with teardrops in your eye (To the descent)
Every time you hear that man you cry (From the origin)

Viva la Vinyl,Sick to D(eat)h,2014,"I love hearing vinyl static on timeless classics
I sit back and kick my feet up until my mind relaxes
Time passes slow like it was pitched down
The globe spins on its axis but the needle never skips town
'Cause I clean it
I take proper care of my LPs
But every single spin brings the groove closer to its knees
It's normal everyday wear and tear
Takes an especially professional ear to hear it
But from year to year
You notice subtle differences from multiple listens
It's upsetting 'cause you wanted to have something to hand down to the children
Sure, you could convert it all to mp3
And it probably already exists digitally--that's not your history
In fact, it lacks the full experience
We built bulldozers and smashed the magic out of the pyramids
Kids don't understand, they're laughing when you're serious
You just shrug your shoulders, and admit how silly it is
Somewhere in a grandma's attic, there's a little brat
Who stumbles upon a phonograph, perfectly intact
He uses a sheet of paper to make a makeshift slipmat
Now a collection of well-preserved 45s are getting scratched

Who buys vinyl? I mean, it's cool.

Jaw of Steel,Sick Of Wasting,2009,"Everybody want Kevin but nobody want fed
I played cemetaries, been heckled by the dead
But Jeckel never Hyde. Every rhyme that I said
Was part man, part wolf. Fight. Never fled
Tighten up the rents on little leather boots
The type to make advances but then never recruits
Loosing to the man while the independent groups
Got a bullet proof plan: ""don't meddle with the suits""
My peddle got the loops. My chamber got the echo
Invensted way too much in this here anger to let go
My vicious cycle is a calm steady tempo
I always extinguish birthday candles with a death blow
Dim mark. Hand touch of the faithful
Secrets never leak. Keep the Mescalito playful
Devil on my shoulder saying ""I don't need no angel""
Other shoulder's cold silence hanging from a halo
It's the Jaw of Steel
Swing low sweet chariot of fire
Let me know if you need any help carrying it higher
Had it up to here with this valley of desire
Being fearful of a god, and married to a liar
Now daddy's tired of the war that he feels
Mommy's defenseless with a cross on her shield
The golden glove champ born in a field
Backed into a corner, it's the Jaw of Steel
Rewind, Selector. Run that tape backwards
Reverse the curse and become radioactive
It takes practice just excaping these straight jackets
In a land full of snakes without no Saint Patricks
My Irish temper is a curse that is a blessing
A sign that I'm alive although at first it gets upsetting
A burst of addrenaline that then turns to depression...
And I only go to church for a funeral or wedding
Sometimes I can't tell one from the other
The type of place where you could loose a best friend or a lover
A bunch of people crying, keepin stuff under the cover
Confess all your sins, mother fucker
Come down, Selector. Boom! Bye bye to the emperor
Would you die? Die for his leather?
Rely on the weather. They manipulate it with machines
Parade around naked til you freeze
Tornado chase her. Drink with your rival
Listen to the wind get caught in the spin cycle
Worship the idol American psycho
Portrait of a boxer trading in his golden gloves for a rifle

Strange Famous,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Maybe you're never really living till you've understood what death is
So I touched the human spirit with lyrics some say are breathless
It's that breathlessness that inspired my tired hand
To write these endless epilogues that some call pretentious
Living verse existence surviving, verse thriving in an environment
Vitamin supplements and a government's removal of pensions retirement
Empty out your life savings cause your wife's handing that knife collection
Could have used some type of protection but you sliced through her midsection
Even though the sex was great you want belly thin
Didn't want to ruin the love canal and that's why you went too serried
And everyone's got your own opinion, ask your librarian about the alien
Legal aliens, vegan terrorist and all of the vegetarian activists
Male malchy and alchemists grab a fistful of calculus pals
Who dissed over the lack of apple cum math-or-piss
Build but calluses on the phalluses of Alice and Wonderland-scapers
Put on your happy face, here comes the hand shakers with sand paper gloves
They wanna jerk you off with, to further off quick
Cause I prefer the soft lips of a whore's kiss
I lick my wounds and force my tongue into the opening
Communicating with infections that took residence when I broke my skin
I've learned their language now my infectious speech gets sickening
But my poetry has become a scab lies just can't help picking
Tickling too many worldly fancies whimpering on my hands and knees
Crawling fast through laundry mats pilfering girlie's panties
Ya heard me? Man please
I ain't take nothing without paying except for school books and blank tapes
Throw in a can-a-pee from a canopy can a pee brain hit me in plain day
Are we game though we came with weak aim

Stuck (f. Slug),UnKnown,UnKnown,"You act smart, while I act dumb
But I know some that still lay under my thumb
See, we've got issues we swing our fists for whatever
Trying to keep the tempo down to the grissle
They like the small talk, as long as it's about you
They walk that walk, without knowing how to
I watch it all, and pretend that I'm above it
But the truth is, I see her I need it I love it
I'm stuck with random stray hairs from ex-lovers
Entangled in each other's desire to stay here beyond their welcome
Sharing the same common problem blond and brunette
And I don't fit in with split ends
Didn't have to worry about them taking me from my dividends
Payed my dues spending time by myself
She was with her friends, mingling with single men
Say things like hitting skins to them
Thinking it's innocent but then giving me guilty grins
Swimming with filthy fins, knocking boots, kicking my shins
Shark infested torture treatment get beat by the Timbalands
Feet is shivering walking on cold rage
Roses like un-relationships, too much patience to die of old age
Yeah, remember when you knew all the answers?
Well something shook until you thought you had the questions
For all the time and effort you've invested
I find it kind of funny that you haven't learned your lesson still guessin'
The whisper of the leaf, the rustle of the bitch
When there is no love, nothing makes you rich
So I give a shrug, and the eye muscle twitches
In replace of a hug and a lack of superstitions
Stop thinking you don't belong here
You are where you are 'cause you hardly move
The music is not gonna' stop, take your eyes of the chair
'Cause there's others that are under the same impressions as you
How many seats will the rock bottom accommodate?
One, too, many people who share nothing but views
Misery is willing to keep company
With those who don't ever walk a mile in their own shoe
So now they swap souls they got soul, fuckin' uninspired
They drive low under the fire of sky dives
It got old and now they wanna' go higher
But cops control every single empire with tripods
So video, did kill the radio star
Now we're all so cute and drive brand new cars
We make music so you can lose your minds
We do the crimes, so you can do the times
Tell me who can get busy like this man
Well the truth is, damn near anyone can
So I'ma buy you some implants and a suntan
Let's follow the plan and get some fat off the land
Fuck this little rapper, treat me like a crook
Maybe if you knew me, you wouldn't sing my hook
You'd think I was so ugly, you'd be afraid to look
But maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get a chapter in your book
Doing fine thanks for asking, standing as the last man
Popping bubbles and aspirin'
Ready, set, action, remove your dress so we can make a mess
And hit the world with a little bit of stress
Let's head talk these winds until they, strengthen for getting footwork
Making power moves on ceilings with head spin
It unravels the bloody ground, revealing red sin
We created hierarchy, now there are no kings in heaven
Fatty acids added to the asthma medicine
Breathing heavy at the gates make them have to let us in
Like implying we've been trying our hardest
Using everyone else's honest way of dying as an armrest
I promise broken over dislocated kneecaps
And it's harmless jokes that provoke freak accidents
Laugh at that lap dancer who strips off confidence
I live off of hope, and providence
Communication tactics are all fucked up
Don't blame me I had nothing to do with this
You play the same damn records everyday
No wonder you never believe you'd never get away
You wear the same pair of jeans you woke up in
Keep the music coming, keep the movements sudden
I watched you dance every street of this city
I feel no pity, you laid the carpet
You made the target by yourself, little help
Now loosen up the belt and straighten up the apartment
Finish that book that you never even started
Take a look at that face that hates to look back
Set the oven on bake take a pen out the rack
Season up your past put it in and cook that
Stop thinking you don't belong here
You are where you are 'cause you hardly move
The music is not gonna' stop, take your eyes of the chair
'cause there's others that are under the same impressions as you

Flashback (1996),Sick Of Wasting,2009,"Now I can't even think back
When I reminisce on my own past I cringe
It gets under my skin like a syringe
I binge on food for thought
Avoiding memory lane on my way home
Get lost and have to look for a pay phone
It's so strange
I've got no change
I could have sworn I did when I left
My breath gets heavy with every theft
??Y'all didn't look round my childhood??
If I could have smiled I would
Try to keep them to a minimum
But one got cracked while I was killing 'em
Back to the present here and now in modern times
When Satan's got me signing dotted lines
I pick up the phone and call
People in my own hometown collect
And tell them things change, but they just won't accept
That's no surprise
, it's so ironic me having to ask them for directions
But I just got dead air, cut lines and bad connections
People who would help
Change their number to unlisted
411 info left me unassisted
Wickedly twisted happenings
Is it coincidence?
I choose to think so
Deep in thought my eyes blink slow
Pictures appear like slideshows
Cause my mind knows
Each and every minute detail
Total recall is leaving me pale
Sick to my stomach, nauseous
Forces of nature bring my homing instinct
It stinks
It's so distinct
Now let me think a minute
Huh, this is the much traveled trail from my past
No one unbeaten path
And funny memories are now making me laugh
Just a flash back kid, it's just a flashback
I'm getting laughed at mental attack, mental attack
I should design forts
To pro-tect my mind
From these time warps
Cause I'm off course
Begin to rethink my final thoughts
Philosophies
My personal creations face conflict
You're slipping
By following my footsteps
Cause I'm slick
Now I, stand alone in this ghost town
My clothes make the most sound
Upside down smiles
Grin while folks frown
I feel my Sacred
Heart get filled with hatred
Ancient rituals of a teary eyed child
With nothing fake kid
The flash backs of my past acts
Are numerous
Inside the uterus
Other kinds haven't been so humorous
My laugh lines are faked for the last time
I'm past my prime
Climaxing again is a task of mine
I'm homeward bound; break out the map and atlas
I ask gas station attendants kid and they act pissed
I'm black listed
For not staying true to white lies
I fight guys in darkness
Heartless until the night dies
And Then I shed some light on what's the matter
Reflections in the looking glass self scatter
When the hard stairs made it shatter
7 years back luck?
That ain't nothing new!
I'm searching for something true
But most my friends are fronting too
What's up with you?
Only once you catch amnesia
Same old procedure
Valuable times lost at leisure
Plus I broke my compass
The needle always points backwards
There's no communications
Whack herbs
That cost me black words
Impossible
Facial expressions in sign language
Cause your mind anguish
Misinterpretations are dangerous
No one knows who the stranger is
But still yet know my face is vaguely familiar
Thinking back wouldn't kill you would it?
Or would it?
I can't catch no one's attention
Even Ignored by the lord
My mind sided dimensions

Most of the time he just listens/
Other times offers suggestions or he just ignores my questions/
It gets more depressing as time passes/
Every night I ask this one question/
And all he does is wipe his glasses/
It's aggravating as hell/
I'm just waiting to tell/
Whether or not he can even remember the answer/
Whether or not he's choosing not to tamper with his memory/
Whether or not he can even f****** remember me/
What a waste of time!/
But every night it's that same damn routine/
One green cup of tea/
And me stuck all by myself once its empty/
And then I'm off to bed with plenty of caffeine to keep me up and thinking/
The cup I'm drinking from is never clean/
I can't remember if it's a dream once I awake and I walk/
From my messy bed and anticipate our next late night talk/

Why are you still sitting here
I'm not afraid of you
You are not incriminating!
What is it that you want from me
I'm not leaving
I want to stay, I want to stay...)

He stays up with me and we discuss things/
Most of the time he just listens/
Other times offers suggestions with his awful expressions/
Altered reflections/
His whole aura is see-through/
With more confessions, I don't want to leave you/
This cup should be bottomless!/
As my insecurities spill/
I see his face fading away, I surely need a refill/
I purposely keep still and don't move much/
Except to wet my lips with sips/
With every kiss of death I lose touch/
I sip the tea carefully/
Because its at the degree of separation/
Tasting the forked tongue in bilingual conversation/
Waiting for his answer still/
And at any given chance I will/
Sweet and Low my bitter past, let the cancer kill the small talk/
Alright man, this bitter taste in my mouth needs to get washed out/
Ghosts in this house don't have anything timely to talk about/
The concept is dead, there's nothing death should interrupt/

Kiddie Litter,Sickly Business,UnKnown,"Lights flicker on the frame of a light sleeper...watching sports
In a stained wife beater and boxer shorts
Night creeps in-between the uneven slides of venetian blinds
And it sees signs of struggle
He resides in a jungle where the weeds dry and tumble
Every time he deserts love and leaves behind his troubles
This time it seems he's finally humbled;
Defeated by the feline he's been trying to subdue, beaten while they cuddle
Now subtle differences got him running from images
Weird as it is, circus mirrors are a serious fear of his
He stays a safe distance from the scary kid
His beard is big and he wears a wig in public appearances
Here he is...half alive in the flesh suit
Curious and appetized by the fresh fruit
Served on a dish at his nightly help group
Who dreamt of catching better Z's? Most people would've slept through it
If you ain't been through it, then you don't know the way the days
Just waste away. A change of pace needs to take place
I play with razor blades and I shake
Until I shave my face and the break....
Of day lights flicker on the frame of a light sleeper...watching sports
In a stained wife beater and boxer shorts
Sun rays creep in-between the uneven slides of venetian blinds
And it sees signs of struggle
He hides a bundle of demons behind the stubble
Sleep dehydrates him 'til the dreams dry and crumble
Bleeding from his eyes, the scene of the crime's a puddle
Where he cries Uncle...and doesn't realize he's lovable
Lover girl doesn't purr because she sees
Something of hers stuck in a world that needs to be freed
This cat's got tongues tied 'til she leaves
A curiosity that could kill an entire species
""See these fingers of mine?"" Yes
""It's time to see if one of them fits the dark ring around your eyes,"" She says
So she sends me to a guy who signs permission slips
And if his finger fits...
He's going to poke inside to see what's alive
So I went to where she sent me only to find a blind man
With worn down fingertips
And his neck was a library full of razor bumbs
He placed a cup on a tabled labeled ""Talk to Me""
And he snuck a smile passed the customs of his scruffy face
He just stared in my general direction and said...",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-kiddie-litter-lyrics
Next Testament (Gimme Fund 04),UnKnown,UnKnown,"AUTHOR: Sage Francis
""Find God!"" exclaimed the man, who lost everything he owned, looking stoned
I groaned back, ""Find a job, here's an application.""
Retaliation: ""Here's a pamphlet.""
I said, ""F**k this damn shit.""
My man flipped and threw his hand into his pocket
Pulled out a bible with a design that looked tribal
The Next Testament was its title
""Look it over.""
""A book? Nosuh... what the hell does this have to offer?""
A small mirror on the bottom labeled ""author""
That's too impersonal
Irreversible actions leave our mind scarred
Looking for the answers. ""Find God!"" he said again
But I'm a veteran
Knowing that you are no better than or worse than
He compared my last enemy to my first friend
This bum gave me his shirt's pen
""What the heck? You're completely tapped, thinking that I'm gonna' write you out a check.""
He said, ""What?"" I said, ""WHAT!"" Snatched the book in hopes of finding a myth
Lifted up the front cover, broke the binding
""I bring peace, love happiness and unity!""
Usually I blow it off, but I said, ""That ain't what you do to me
What you do to me is bring pain, hate, ignorance, and false alternatives to my community.""
He sat back and thought it over, with a look that's sort of sober
He stared me in the eye and said ""I don't lie""
(Him or me? Me or him?)
Now we begin to quarrel over what's historical
But that's immoral questioning the oracle's origin
We're born through sin
""You need to save yourself,"" he said
""But Jesus died for our sins."" Then he said, ""He ain't dead.""
""He faked his death?""
I watched my man take a breath as if he had no more patience left
Then he embraced his chest
Looked as if the holy spirit was about to manifest itself
Mental health is what he lacked. I should have known this
Without God, when we die every Earthling is homeless
I couldn't look. Tried to give him back his book
As he shook. But it was stuck to my hand
What the fuck? God damn!
Embellished in sin and with a devilish grin
This denizen could tell that I was selfish within
He started speaking in tongues that I'm unfamiliar with
I held the pen like a knife and threatened, ""I kill your myth!""
Civilians drift into a state of violent anger
I can tell when I'm in danger so I stopped to take a breather
""Listen, I'm a non-believer with no faith, and I don't want none either
It's time for me to leave ya', take your book, I ain't no crook.""
He said, ""It's yours, like the world, read it good, there's directions.""
I flipped through the pages, but they were blank, no deceptions
He mentioned, ""Look deeper. You'll see it says more than you could share.""
I asked, ""Where?""
He replies, ""That's what the pen's for.""",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-next-testament-gimme-fund-04-lyrics
Inherited Scars (Gruvis Malt 03),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I didn't tell anyone about what I seen or heard that day, mums the word still
I'm scared to plant ideas into your head while your rebellious side is fertile
Hurdles are getting knocked down
I'm running a losing race
Your legs aren't the only ones marked up - how many dreams have you chased?
If I could have said this to your face maybe you wouldn't have to write like I do
Except I use paper instead of my body now; it's something you might want to try too
From haikus to horror stories, it's something in our blood that we share
Something in our blood that appears on the surface of our skin when we bring it there
My facial expression said I didn't care
Hate and aggression must've made an impression on the little kid who stared
Sitting on stairs when I would bother to bring my skates
My feeble attempt at being a strong, big brother doing father figure 8's
Ripping my cape on the ground that it dragged on
Tripping on fate and hearing the sounds of a sad song
Listen, it's great sharing time now that dad's gone
But what's with the choice of words?
Or the body parts that you decided to tag them on?
I'm a vagabond, who moved to modern day Babylon and then back again
With minimal contact and you know I can't ask your mom what's happening
You've got such beautiful gifts What are you doing ruining the packaging?
How ironic come to think I probably put this ink on my back for him
I want you to laugh and sing more
But you dropped anchor in a place
Where dreams go to die and you're keeping your ass indoors
I'm asking for you to stick it out and see things through
You're asking for me to zip my mouth and keep it just between me and you

If I could have been there from the beginning if I could be there right now
If I could promise to be there when you need me, would it raise an eyebrow?
How would your body be different if I still dropped by for visits?
Is it my place to put a smile on your face?
Could I erase your body language telling you its all been said before?
Or change the words you wrote, exchanging your scars for my metaphors?
I'd add them to my collection while smiling
Next time you want to paint with razor blades and need a canvas use my skin

Hiding your sins well, but I see the hell that your limbs speak
Tongue in cheek Lying awake in bed while other kids sleep
The strength of evil begins to keep your grins weak
No matter the length of the needle
Marking up one's body is so much more than skin deep
Feel the pin prick The grim reep what they sew and you're trained to say that you're fine
Your threshhold for pain is greater than mine
So I'm waiting in the lines that you give me patiently
While you get cut in the lines that THEY make YOU wait inin ways that they can't see
If there's a vacancy as far as room in your life goes
Say it to me But don't do it with a knife under your clothes
Because the anguish of hidden skin is letting my ghosts be shown
Plus the language its written in hits especially close to home
I'm most alone when I'm out of touch with the people who feel this type of pain
You might just aim for a day that its raining to strike a vein to take my name in
Changing your uniform and altering your mind set
Has your pointer finger decided if it was a fault of his or mine yet?I bet
I know the dialect It's nowhere I haven't been before
With skin that's sore Battle scars that rise from our inner war
Are decorative medals of honor that our father decided to pass through inheritance
And it is repetitive when the kids head in the direction of evidence
Proving the pain and hurt is relative
All this pain and hurt is relative...

You don't want me here
You don't want me here, now do you?
You don't want me here
You don't want me here, now
You don't want me here, now
Now you don't really want me
From what I hear my extra baggage is a turn off
My carry on luggage gets smuggled in the bags under my eyes
I'm a travelin' man
Without sleep on my itenerary
I eat whatever's vegetarian
I'll live with vegan, that's my saving grace
I gave up chase in the human mating race
'Cause I can't slow down my aging face
Wrinkles become my road maps
And my one last tire is going bald
Rubbing it when checking messages
Knowing no one called
I trooop on
On the road again
Tired of what I wrote
I spend one more quarter to phone a friend
And hold a pen up to the reciever
Lettin' the ink seep into their ear
Waitin' for any intelligent speach, they've got to share
Most people can't think deep, but I don't care
I'm not concerned with them
I've learned to fend for me, my own
And I've got a lonely girlfriend back home
Who makes me feel a lot better when I return
I'm waitin' for that ""Dear John"" letter
I'm gettin' her a souvenier

You don't want me here, now really?
You don't want me here

You don't really want me
Too much time all by myself
I've been around others I do not ???
These personal moments feeling about as meaningless as phone sex
Don't stress me living in your condition
As still I'm that reason for that whole mess
I'm not in need of shelter
I'm just homeless
I'm a homeboy who's homely
Never known to be a homebody
Nobody knows the amount of body blows
Or head shops at they got at rest stops
I gotta go let's ride hip hop shows ???
Let me download you on my desktop
I keep it real audio
Let's talk before the phone card expired
Or let it know I'm far from wired
Why? Cause I just rocked that show hard
And I'm tired
Use a Gold Card to buy her a silver lined dark cloud
When it rains, it pours, it's hard out
But I fear that it may have dried out, pied out
I lay down to earth girls who say ""stop""
When they realize the only reason I'm outta this world is cause I'm a space shot
These relations aren't making me feel any better
When I return I'm handing her that ""Dear Jane"" letter
I done got her a souvenier
You don't want me here
You don't want me
We're all rock stars
We do big drugs
And we have big heads
And we have big sex

Flashback 96,Sick Of Wasting,2009,"No tricks
No tricks
It's just a flashback-
Now I can't even think back
When I reminisce on my own past I cringe
It gets under my skin like a syringe
I binge on food for thought
Avoiding memory lane on my way home
Get lost and have to look for a pay phone
It's so strange
I've got no change
I could have sworn I did when I left
My breath gets heavy with every theft
??Y'all didn't round my childhood??
If I could have smiled I would
Try to keep them to a minimum
But one got cracked while I was killing 'em
Back to the present here and now in modern times
When Satan's got me signing dotted lines
I pick up the phone and call
People in my own hometown collect
And tell them things change, but they just won't accept
That's no surprise; it's so ironic me having to ask them for directions
But I just got dead air, cut lines and bad connections
People who would help
Change their number to unlisted
411 info left me unassisted
Wickedly twisted happenings
Is it coincidence?
I choose to think so
Deep in thought my eyes blink slow
Pictures appear like slideshows
Cause my mind knows
Each and every minute detail
Total recall is leaving me pale
Sick to my stomach
Nauseous
Forces of nature bring my homing instinct
It stinks
It's so distinct
Now let me think a minute
Huh, this is the much traveled trail from my past
No one unbeaten path
And funny memories are now making me laugh
Just a flash back kid, it's just a flashback
I'm getting laughed at mental attack, mental attack
I should design forts
To pro-tect my mind
From these time warps
'Cause I'm off course
Begin to rethink my final thoughts
Philosophies
My personal creations face conflict
You're slipping
By following my footsteps
Cause I'm slick
Now I stand alone in this ghost town
My clothes make the most sound
Upside down smiles
Grin while folks frown
I feel my Sacred
Heart get filled with hatred
Ancient rituals of a teary eyed child
With nothing fake kid
The flash backs of my past acts
Are numerous
Inside the uterus
Other kinds haven't been so humorous
My laugh lines are faked for the last time
I'm past my prime
Climaxing again is a task of mine
I'm homeward bound; break out the map and atlas
I ask gas station attendants kid and they act pissed
I'm black listed
For not staying true to white lies
I fight guys in darkness
Heartless until the night dies
And Then I shed some light on what's the matter
Reflections in the looking glass self scatter
When the hard stairs made it shatter
7 years back luck?
That ain't nothing new !
I'm searching for something true
But most my friends are fronting too
What's up with you?
Only once you catch amnesia
Same old procedure
Valuable times lost at leisure
Plus I broke my compass
The needle always points backwards
There's no communications
Whack herbs
That cost me black words
Impossible
Facial expressions in sign language
Cause your mind your mind anguish
Misinterpretations are dangerous
No one knows who the stranger is
But still yet know my face is vaguely familiar
Thinking back wouldn't kill you would it?
Or would it?
I can't catch no one's attention
Even Ignored by the lord
My mind sided dimensions
It's just a flashback kid, it's just a flashback
I'm getting laughed at mental attack; mental attack…",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-flashback-96-lyrics

What they need to do is organize their thoughts
Meanwhile
Them organized heads are bullshittin'
Just because it ain't all that on paper, they act like it ain't written
Spittin' lyrics while they sittin' in my backseat
Forgot that I was at the cipher they said it at last week
He practiced to the beat
That he had me play on my house stereo
Hopin' to get in the blouse of every hoe
I got doubts I just can't bury yo
What's the reality
You ain't sharp and witty kid it ain't your personality
The verse and technicality
You're trying to look blind
Dispersing analogies, I know it took time
Let me check your book of rhymes
Crooks commit crimes, writers write!
Don't be ashamed you had to stay up by your lamplight all night
Just to
Sound alright
Just to
Come correct
Just to get some respect from people who ain't heard it done yet
I ain't one to sweat what you call ""off the dome""
Cause I know that yesterday you said it over the phone
To your peoples back home
Every freestyle that you do I find your crew
Lip syncing all the words right behind you
Yelling all the punchlines and back ups
Them wack fucks probably wrote half them shits cause your rap sucks
Maybe it's them I should be dealing with
But you're the one getting props and I'm not feeling it
The only thing that's really coming off the top of your head; is dandruff
Man if I ever hear what you said, one more time
I'll grab the mic and finish your rhyme
Acting like I'm a psychic as I shine, cracker shine
99.9% of the time
Freestyle rhymes are cut and paste rehearsed lines
A frontin' MC is the worst kind
Most have forgot that he wrote that shit last night
That's right!
Prepared freestyles
He must of forgot that he wrote that shit last night

Makeshift Patriot (Gruvis Malt 03),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(People talking)
I'm tired of hearing of young fellows, who think you know it all
You know nothing, you have not seen a shot fired
And you're waving the damn flag
Frank, what's that man?
I'm just watching some bullshit
On the news. It's fucking bullshit
Reporters trying to win a fucking emmy
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)
It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself for your live telecast
Coming live from my own funeral
Beautiful weather offered a nice shine
Which is suitable for a full view of a forever altered skyline
It's times like these I freestyle biased opinions every other sentence
My journalist ethic slips when I pass them off as objectives
Don't give me that ethical shit
I've got exclusive, explicit images to present to impressionable american kids
And it's time to show this world how big our edifice is
That's exactly how they attacked
When a typically dark-skinned disney villain
Use civillians against civillians and charge the trojan horse into our buildings
Using commercial aviation as instruments of destruction
Pregnant women couldn't protect their children;
Wheelchairs were stairway obstructions
I had to back-pedal from the shower of glass and metal
Wondering if after it settles
We'll find who provided power to radical rebels
The melting pot seems to be calling the kettle black when it boils over
But only on our own soil
So the little boy holds a toy soldier
And waits for the suit and tie to come home
We won't wait till he's older, though
Before we destroy hopes for a colder war to end
I'll get a close-up of his head
Makeshift patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself at half mast
(3x)
It's the makeshift
The patriot
The flag shop is out of stock
I hang myself while the stock markets crash
The city is covered in inches of muck
I see some more pictures of victims are up
Grieving mothers are thinking their children are stuck
Leaping lovers are making descisions to jump while holding hands
To escape the brutal heat;
Sometimes in groups of three
The fallout was far beyond the toxic clouds where people look like debris
But all they say when all was said
Beyond the talking heads
Was the bloody dust with legs
Looking like the walking dead calling for meds
All the hospitals overwhelmed
Volunteers need to go the hell home
Moments of silence for firefighters were interrupted by cell phones
Who's going to make that call, to increase an unknown death toll?
Its the one we rally behind
He's got a megaphone, promising to make heads roll
We'd cheer him on, but asbestos is affecting our breath control
The less we know, the more they fabricate
The easier it is to sell souls
(Man talking)
There is a new price on freedom, so buy into it while supplies last
Changes need to be made;
No more curbside baggage
Seven pm curfew
Racial profiling will continue with less bitching
We've unified over who to kill, so until I find more relevant scripture to quote
Remember, our kind is bigger, stronger, smarter, and much wealthier
So wave those flags with pride, especially the white part
We're selling addictive, twenty-four hour candlelight vigils on TV
Freedom will be defended at the cost of civil liberties
The viewers are glued to television screens, stuck
'cause lots of things seem too sick
I use opportunities to pluck heartstrings for theme music
I'll show you which culture to pump your fist at
Which foot is right to kiss
We don't really know who the culprit is yet
But he looks like this
We know who the heroes are
They're not the xenophobes who act hard
We taught that dog to squat
How dare he do that shit in our own back yard
They happen to scar our financial state
And char our landscape
Can you count how many times so far I ran back the same damn tape?
While the cameraman creates news and shoves it down our throats
On the west bank, with the ten second clip put on constant loop to provoke US angst
So get your tanks and load your guns and hold your sons in a family huddle
'cause even if we win this tug of war and even the score
Humanity struggles
There's a need of blood for what's been uncovered under the rubble;
Some of them dug for answers in the mess
But the rest were looking for trouble

And that's simply adorable
When my time is affordable
Dimes pay the price I get abusive and that's the truth
It's just a fucking shame this is how I choose to communicate
Excuses I produce have their roots in the music I make
She's not a fan nor am I famous
I may just change and adjust when I branch out
Leave, get off my damn couch and achieve
What I dream about leave my house hand out my keys
To the sleepless beauty who failed math class and can't count her Z's
The tree dies
She says that she's mine she's my proprietress
Can't hold on to most of what I owned
Besides she likes to kiss and that's cute
I hug her till I start to hurt her
She wants to dance to my pulse but I've got heart murmurs
A shark circles our lifeboat till its fin folds
The monster we created might choke in clothes
I'm naked walking tight ropes without big toes
Couldn't see this with the night-scope bid my skin glow
Fallen
Calling for a safety net
The great white might drain me of my life
Bite into my veiny neck where dreams are falling asleep
Could dry up once she sees that I bleed off beat
Head over heels cause she's tripping on her own feet
That puzzled look on her face still isn't complete
She gives bits and pieces of herself
While I'm breaking myself open I pour my contents to her shelf
Pardon me but is that me wearing my heart out on my sleeve
With razor sharp teeth gnawing at my wrist how beautiful is this
The most beautifulest thing in the world
Is making up words when I have none else left to say to a girl
Making her curl up in a ball in a corner of my eye
Taking a time out I don't want her to cry
I don't ever want to be considered the sort of guy
Who says, ""I just might break your face tonight""
I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me away, blow me away
I spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire blow me out
When I send you love poems in the form of smoke signals
Over average marriage materialist mister righteous
A savage miscarriage of just us just us
And a dust that never settles
I'm restless spread some metal to make it weep
Cause discussing the ugly nobody wants to fuck with
Don't touch me
Under appreciative with a with a hundred weaknesses
What do I need to live?
The blood I bleed is thicker than the skin I shoot people with
Need a fist to the air
Pretend to make believe she cares
To open up old wounds and usual bruises on my ego up here
I'm a low self-esteem engine in need of a horsepower
Out of sleeping powder
Dark clouds follow me with heat seekers
I need a colder shower
To showboat when exposes my phonetic quest
Cause it won't float if it turns out these are permanent echoes in his chest
I think its best to turn the reverb down
Kill the delay
Get me the fuck out of this cave
I could paint you pictures all day
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals that way
I'm not gonna pander to Neanderthals today
The one that I'm with thinks sex is a beautiful thing
She thinks I'm something special
She's my specialist
More beautiful than sex
Cause only something like sex
Makes something so lovely turn ugly and fuck up shit
I'm holding a sleepless beauty pageant
On my shark-infested waterbed until it's punctured
I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until I pull a muscle
I spread my love, spread my love, spread my love until its see through
Spread my love like the legs of a crack whore
We sleep together but don't sleep to keep it simple
You dance around me like a fire
Blow me away blow me away blow me away blow me away

After all god loves this whole of worms, but hates common black sheep who refuse to follow the shepherd. Who heard little lambs into slaughter?-LISTEN - to the silence of the man's-LIFE-is a serial killer far
Too complex to expose any logical pattern, below saturn and mars there are stars dominating the tunnel vision of cast obstruction and jesus might have been a biological weapon of mass destruction,/
Specifically designed to wipe out millions with vanity and pride, lab engineered and born, advanced chemistry in a bowl of germs like hybrid corn, complete with hidden agenda beneath the surface lurking and smirking under a crown of thorns./
The crucifixion was a hoax, a cruel joke shop poison rose bud, emanating smoke screen and only begotten son soap suds
Â€œCome and Wash Your Sins Away!â€, said the spider to the flying rows of holy roman hope bugs./
Let's see if we can give noah's old flood a run for it's money with the first drop of cold blood from the cross began a damned birth. the contamination spread without aids hospital orderly's or cancer sticks, and stone moving angels, but no bones for artifacts or relics, just a vacant hole on easter sunday and a note about his rising soul,/ sounds pretty fishy; stand atop the mount and feed me loaves of bullshit our last meal was a feast at a table headed by a lupine figure hiding in fleece./
No one ever thought to check jesus for the sign of the beast, no one ever lifted his hair and looked beneath, it was there on his neck, no one cared, or was even looking for proof./
What, you didn't expect joe and mare' to volunteer the truth, and judas did not hang from his own noose,/
It was just made to look that way, Jesus Christ! he was a planned device, schizophrenic double edge sword; prophet and antichrist;/
Good but ultimately evil, with multiple people within shouting orders. leading the flock over the border and through the woods into the land of honey milk and slaughter,/
Selling water for wine in between black out gorges on swine, eventually leading up to crusaders with torches in line, all the way to Jerusalem from north of the Rhine,/
Infected by motives that were all but divine, and the same virus has still got the sons and daughters of time on life support waiting for orders to die./
They struggle to stay afloat while their saviour keeps walking on by, on top of the water kicking salt in their eyes./
It's all in the mind state, they're all still alive but planning their own wake, waiting for the wave of an apocalypse that already came to break;
F**K ARMEGEDDON, life is heaven and hell, the only fate is what we make/ the only fate is what we make fate is what we make, fate is what we make, we make fate
Your essence was conceived and born to breathe in pictures of fields without fences, it remains relatively unconcerned with this non existent god forsaken whole of worms; natural selection has you headed for shangri-la, don't settle for jesus in a bowl of germs, don't settle for allah, amon-ra, vishnu, or abraham in a bowl of germs. don't settle for anything less than universal respect for every living creature that has breath in it's lungs and chest regardless of race, sex, preference, or whatever the f**k it says in ancient text",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-jesus-in-a-bowl-of-germs-lyrics

We're trying to save the spot, we'e trying to save the spot
(cut)
Eyedea:
We're tryin' to save the spot
Hey, yo I break your props
You see me do a lot of shows
I get paid a lot...
So when I hit the mike I make the instrumentals distort
MC's are on my nuts just like a genital wart
And they won't ever stop, they straight connected
I break their record, their whole style's just fake-infected
So why don't they get some realness
They act like they can't feel this
They on the ground like an oil spill
Musta been somebody that tied two sperms together and made 'em
Ditch the egg, before I switch the peg
Wait a minute, how did he just get in it
So cynical, this individual will flip it every 
And - reaching with my tentacles...
I just grab the microphone from individuals
Lyrically advanced? huh-yeah, that's a maybe
MC's can never play me, I make grown cats look like babies
When I flow raps, I beak caps of knees
When I smack MC's, they are as whack to me, I attack the beat
But they ain't understandin'
This man is just damagin'
Every rapper on the planet where he's standing-
And even if he's sittin'
And even if he's not spittin'
This kid is just rippin' the microphone
Forever grippin' it
Tight! keepin' it tight! Holdin' the mike! Fend for my life!
And then I'm grabbin' it, stabbin' it right into the middle of your eyesight
It's so easy for me to bend mikes
I get in pen-fights
And then I break pencils
And take your stencils;
Out of my mind, I'm
Out of the frame, I'm
Under your skin, over your head, and
All in the game...
You know what I'm sayin' and it's just
All in my name
While your girl is like- yeah, she's good at
Callin' my name
She's like, ""Eyedea, how do you spell it?
With a capital E?
When you smackin' MC's
And they as whacked at practicing beats?""
Freestylin', but they ain't understanding
This man is diminishing cats
Like popeye without spinach
And finishin' raps
Take em' to the end and replenish them cats
Who think they're thinkin' when they're stinkin' with their raps?
Hey! One time in my life I had spinal meningitis...
Yo, but after that I realized that on the mike I'm the tightest!
And MC's wanna like this, but they can never invite this
I recite (tihs) that'll make God wanna just...
Recruit me for a team of angels
See your dreams get strangled
MC's I mangle
In the middle of their face, this individual's got bass
When I flip riddles on a ritual basis, taste this, hey kid
Wait a minute, yo I'm about to stop -
Illogic, grab the microphone and let 'em know just how you rock:",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-orphanage-freestyle-part-ii-lyrics
Broken Wings (Gruvis Malt 03),UnKnown,UnKnown,"She's a fairy with broken wings
I used to watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
'Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground we walk
She glides but just seems like she floats
And these folks decide to crush her wings until they're permanently broke
She rides gusts of wind just by the way she spoke
She cries but loves to sing songs of freedom and hope
On the East side hustling discussing things that we quote
In shallow conversation as if we have deep throats
We choking' on confusion
Now show up as a heat stroke of we need coats
Trading in our cheap jokes for her C notes
I see notes being passed
I ask to see what these creeps wrote
Define silly kids and flying privileges revoke
Ski slopes have been blocked off they can't transcend
Had weights tied to her ankles she most definitely can't skip down
Tried to tie her wings back on before the ones again clip
Panic stricken, shell remain stuck
On a Titanic sinking, she's trying to stay up
Change her plan thinking its okay
See this is strange but
Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves in a way that kept them chained up
I'd like to see
Her take flight into the stars
Instead of letting her fly free they keep her in jars
Instead of letting fly free they keep 'em in jars
I put my hand to the glass so hard
It might break the prison bars
It isn't hard to see why they keep her captive
She's naturally attractive
Speaks with ad-libs, she's uncommonly talented
Ain't enough adjectives to do her disposition justice
Kids are wishing' for just a kiss and it's a mission to touch her lipstick
Can't trust her with
Freedom of movement that's a chance to lose her quick
If she ups and splits
We might as well call that discussion quits
We have ways to keep her down the government's underlings
Enslave people in this town especially if there cultures rich
Exploiting talents making it do a bunch of tricks
With the rest of the wingless imports
Repeatedly told you ain't a fairy, just a bitch
Just a bitch, with a butt that's thick
So rub your tits, and thrust your hips
And suck my dick, and run your shit, and run your shit, and run your shit
She's a fairy with broken wings
I used to go watch her perform
And if she hears me I hope she sings songs
That had me going right back
Couldn't find anyone in town to talk
Bout how no one like that
Should be confined to the ground
When I was down in New York she'd send me letters
And I read her passages about how I left it to the savages
No matter how sad it is I didn't cry
'Cause it was only a matter of time
Before they figured me out and tried to strip my pride
I knew the scoop
Wish you could of seen the blueprints in my eye
When I flew the coop
Utilizing overground railroads in the sky
It was live or die let me let you in on the secret of mine
Me and you are different girl
We don't even need wings to fly
We don't need wings to fly
Me and you, we don't need wings to fly
Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Keep on singing give it a try, give it a try
Just keep on singing give it a try, give it a try",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-broken-wings-gruvis-malt-03-lyrics
KFC (vocals by n8ball),UnKnown,2000.0,"I don't know if it's the pretty face
Or the expensive taste

Hi, how you're doing? My name's Nate, can I take your order?
Just a large soda that's a dollar and a quarter
Customers come and go like seasons of the year
Fat paycheck at the end of the week's the reason why I'm here
Mix powder with water and it turns into gravy
Pour that all over your motherfucking food, we do the chicken right  baby
Serving more wedges than a rebel alliance
Fleet of X-Wings, honey barbecue rings
Customer complaint pierce my ear like a ring
We got all the secret spices and herbs, working for the Colonel
Popcorn chicken, similar to popcorn, but it got no kernels
Here's your cup and a straw
No skill lacking, ever customer service slacking
Kid you know I'm packing, coleslaw
If there's time to lean, then it's time to clean
Team KFC makes the barbecue beans
The boost spray and wipe down the window and doors
Do my job keep from the firing squad
M-O-P the floors
Sweep up the bathrooms clean the poop off the seat
In the bathroom shoot a few hoops with the leftover meat
Clock out for the night, it's the end of the day
Grab a parfait as my employee meal and I'm on my way

Butter for your biscuit, biscuit macaroni and cheese
Everybody wants a little KFC
Come down, buy a bucket, you'll get to meet me
Everybody wants a little KFC
For only six bucks you can eat at the buffet
Everybody wants a little KFC
Tender roast extra crispy original
Everybody wants a little KFC",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-kfc-vocals-by-n8ball-lyrics
Whore Monger Sing-Along,Still Sick... Urine Trouble,UnKnown,"My popularitys on the ri-ise.my self-image is somewhat
Sinking
My heads expanding in size but my stomachs shrinking
It all evens out in the end thats what I'm thinking
Sing the cashregister raps ch-ching ching.green backs bring the bling bling
Na na I may stay home.rev got the ring ring ha ha hey hey poem
While my answering machine screening calls.hailing safe and alone
I want change in your message not the coin return of a payphone
My boys are concerned that my brains blown
Voices get turned away annoyed with what they say
If its a gay tone n they like ""hey ho!"" then I'm all like ""hey yo...""
Few remain prone to spray straight shots with blood stained Glocks
N a face of stone to melt your ice grill it might spill!
N break ya Bone. Thugs-in-Harmony cd presenting tape should own
Replace the thrown with some Non-Prophets drop bass ON
Sage is know to pull your card kid so chill
I mess up plans like robbers with no skill
My only knowledge is the holy father SO THRILLED
That you dont know still what God is making martyrs outta molehills
Now if your soul is fufilled holed your dills
N realize youre never satisfied til after u die from overkill
Im from Placiboville but we know the drill
Obscene is so ill but wait for the nurse to leave so I can throw the pill..
I AM NOT SICK! demeneted or listed as twisted bitch
Whats up with this kid
Some insisted that I'm interested in running from the facts whispered
In a mating call that get a busy signal from a number thats unlisted
Lumberjacks are gifted.when I swung the axe it slid
Out of my grasp n injured this invalid, invalid
Toss-offs toss their cookies while tossing salads
I ghost-write the most hype love sonnet n let some whore sing the ballad

IMA WHORE...A WHORE MONGER! with a platinum voice
IMA WHORE...A WHORE MONGER! cuz I haven't a choice
Servin up this cuz (S!) echo-freaks need to eat

Excrament ain't flauntin rose peddals
I breed hard rocks to impregnate stones to grow pebbles
I throw kettles at pan-handlers n pot-smokers
Sell insest to sexually repressed stockbrokers
I turn impetant pimps to sex slaves
Manifest them with radio activity from x-rays
I bootleg their skeletons the next day
Son u can sense my dark mood once the sky gets gray
Little kids r like ""lets play!haha."" not right then
Tell them to act like men then i'll fight them
Let em hit me first then be like ""strike again!""
Then its my turn to see how far the limbs of little tykes bend
I tied em up, with burlap rope. ""word?thats dope.""
Manhandled the girl that lacked hope n her back broke
She prefered crack cocain. the heroin needed heroin never again
Ladies n gentlelele gentlelele gentlelele..
Im from a species of zsars through the deep seas n stars
Everything I do is important so I save my feces in jars
N what I eat seems bizarr I deep-freeze n thaw
Emcees who ain't down by the gravities of law
Now these anologies ain't raw
But when u secretly serve this well-done yall then become casualties of war
Just call me Francis Allah n I was flattered
Cuz I ghost-wrote the most dope love sonnet let dumb harlet sung the ballad

...and I haven't a choice n if ya snatches ain't moist just

Needle,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It's the b-boy, its the MC, they can't read the grafitti
It's the b-boy, it's the MJ, its the VJ they can't read the grafitti on the walls
(Chorus)
Throw away my tools, scrape with my hands make as much noise as I can banging on sand
I used to play in a band but those people are gone
Now the turntable got a needle in it's arm
I'm in a van flying without parachutes, wifey didn't plan to have marriage disputes
Everytime I stand at the door to say goodbye, its like shes watching her man go to die
I packed in a rush but it was too fast for us, handed me an ultimatum as i grabbed all my stuff
Put a pillow in my briefcase I come with no rebates a gaurantee of return when i leave state
I make mix tapes, but they're cd-r's
Diggin in crates, do you see these scars?
They're from big breaks that i stripped from a song, now the turntable got a needle in its arm
Flame on like burnin', i'm burnin', im burnin', im burnin' but wait...
I fill up the milk crates, collect the LP's
Eric B laughin' at me c-c-check out my melody
DJ Polo doin' pawn, terminator X on an ostrich farm
Jam master J is gone and that's a shame
They say its better to burn out quick than faddddeee
I toured the states with a guy named CR, he had nothin but a tube of toothpaste and guitar
He was a soul brother, a baby mama back at home brother
A good reminder what it is to rock and roll brother
Mashed potatoes every meal and if it ain't served outa greasy spoon he don't deal
Real as it gets with a puff that dont quit put him at a piano and he smokes it
A blues man, to old to go back to school man, still grinding it out but he already payed his dues man
I could see it in his face when he said Sage brother I gotta get out of this place
Embarassed, he knocked me off balance truth of the matter is you can't live off raw talent
Perhaps you could at one point but those days seem gone
Now the turntable got a needle in its arm",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-needle-lyrics
Strange Famous Radio Rhyme,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Maybe you're never really living till you've understood what death is
So i touched the human spirit with lyrics some say are breathless
It's that breathlessness that inspired my tired hand
To write these endless epilogues that some call pretentious
Living verse existence surviving, verse thriving in an environment
Vitamin supplements and a government's removal of pensions retirement
Empty out your life savings cause your wife's handing that knife collection
Could have used some type of protection but you sliced through her midsection
Even though the sex was great you want belly thin
Didn't want to ruin the love canal and that's why you went too serried
And everyone's got your own opinion, ask your librarian about the alien
Legal aliens, vegan terrorist and all of the vegetarian activists
Male malchy and alchemists grab a fistful of calculus pals
Who dissed over the lack of apple cum math-or-piss
Build but calluses on the phalluses of alice and wonderland-scapers
Put on your happy face, here comes the hand shakers with sand paper gloves
They wanna jerk you off with, to further off quick
Cause i prefer the soft lips of a whore's kiss
I lick my wounds and force my tongue into the opening
Communicating with infections that took residence when i broke my skin
I've learned their language now my infectious speech gets sickening
But my poetry has become a scab lies just can't help picking
Tickling too many worldly fancies whimpering on my hands and knees
Crawling fast through laundry mats pilfering girlie's panties
Ya heard me? man please
I ain't take nothing without paying except for school books and blank tapes
Throw in a can-a-pee from a canopy can a pee brain hit me in plain day
Are we game though we came with weak aim

It's on the radio now but it began in the street
I'm chillin', I'm dealin', I'm never ever illin'
I'm taking a trip down memory lane
Anyone who don't like it, my butt they can kiss
The song ain't over, no not yet; I'm just warning you
I'm taking a trip down memory lane

Runaways (Gruvis Malt 03),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(Sage Francis)
It's time to rethink every fact that is imaginable
Survival instinct dwells in a past that is inhabitable
I happen to pull fast ones over the slow parole board
Who likes to speak to de-fanged wolves who cry sheep
Time seeps into our skin, age indicates how long we've been lost in space
I keep putting expression-less upon my face
An awful waste of human skin who waits for Autumn to begin
My fall from grace, will do me in too late
(I'm out of seasoning)
No spring chicken, summer romance novel writer could win a prize
It's Nobel, go to hell in a riding vehicle that he winterized
I change my mind more often than my undergarments
Abide abortion and other nonsense
I'm an orphan who comes from Providence
I am a sign from God! For the parentally misguided
(And I know...)
State is not an ocean, not an island, not a road
If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?
It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home
(And I know...)
State is not an ocean, not an island, not a road
If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?
It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home...
...to where? The land of the lost souls
Feeling the loneliness that really only exists in abandoned foster homes
How many images of missing kids can be fit onto a milk carton?
Framed, they're starting to look the same
Starting to say his name, and claim privileges
As if they found HIM!
The strangest little kids surrounding the circle of false friendship
Rings of fire are connected at the elbow
Cause they're tired, moms unexpectedly let go
The Velcro light component that keeps there unit cohesive
It's the music! So we give reasons to get sober
Life experiences to hum to
These kids play Red Rover? I look for weaknesses to run through
With reckless abandon, they're standin', refuse to go down
The pinballs in their machine bounce between abusive homes now
If its fight or flight, they'll just choose to throw down
Ain't nothing like beating a dead horse, riding it through a ghost town
I move with no sound... I used to think I was invisible
Til they stopped me mid-stride and said
""I think I seen a picture of you...""
Picture that, I said ""Nah I just got one of them faces
Placed next to an expiration date that changes
I kind of look familiar, my name is on the tip of your tongue
The lost look on my face makes you play dumb
Say something colloquial
I need to get my bearings and a feel for where I'm at
But you ain't hearin' that
They shout ""freeze!"" I'm a tourist trapped by townies
Who put bounties on armies and all surrounding counties
Before I bounce, I hear them shout
""Someone help us out, PLEASE!""
We're all alone in the foster home
Killin' ourselves with the house keys...
Not every broken home can come equipped with a fix-it man
And it's a smelly mess once the shit hits the fan
Kids just stand in their circle jerks with there dicks in the sand
Saying ""FUCK THE WORLD"" cause they ain't got no girl
But who do they think I am?
Think again, I'm not that quick to plan ahead of time
I'm two steps behind their schedule, they pretend to have read my mind
I think they just misread the lines in the palm of my hand
Cause, they're random scars caused from slap boxin' with landlords
I ran with the dogs till I realized they were all mutts
Turned bitch once the dog catcher caught up
Forced into trucks, boarded up, put to sleep in the pound
Being an orphan sucks, but I'm through with sneaking around
I see my frown posted up on street lights
And telephone poles, from what they show it seems like
I never grow old, from what they show it seems like
I never go home, and that doesn't seem right
Cause they won't let me grow...
And this is where some go
To avoid the sunrays and the noise of subways
Emerging introverted, unemployed and unshaved
I feel rewarded offering a finder's fee that I know no one will pay
And this is where some go
To avoid the sunrays and the noise of subways
Emerging introverted, unemployed and unshaved
I've got multiple personalities and my inner children are runaways
(And I know...)
State is not an ocean, not an island, not a road
If I don't know where I come from
How do I know where to go?
It's not where you're from, not where you're at
It's where your going... and I am going home...
To the land of the lost souls
Feeling a loneliness that really only exists in abandoned foster homes
I feel rewarded offering a finder's fee that I know no one will pay I've got
Multiple personalities and my inner children are runaways
I feel rewarded offering a finder's fee that I know no one will pay I've got
Multiple personalities and my inner children are runaways
I feel rewarded offering a finder's fee that I know no one will pay I've got
Multiple personalities and my inner children are runaways...

Apathy And Sage On Tone Capone’s Show (90.3 WRIU),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, I'm the type of mc who blames my wackness on instrumentals
What's the deal?
I don't even rhyme no more
I'm all about speakin' rhythmatically
Wack mc's are gettin' mad at me
Sage Francis chillin' with Apathy
Yo I'm-
Yo mc's back with a scratch to be,
Coz I activate my freestyle skills
I can rock ovah the beat and still pay the bills
With a nine to five cuz all my rhymes alive
Apathetic sets it off,
That's no jive that's-
That's the vibe,
It's five past five
Now in my mind will thrive
If it's just chilling in the abyss of ignorance
I lay back and enjoy that ish
As I lay back and enjoy the ish,
Rappers sit back and pop bottles of cryss,
Never with this, cuz Apathetic's the type to diss a clown,
I be ill and represent the underground.
The underground as I read the sound as if there was paper confetti,
Is then cause. My machetti is rippin' through whores
Open them up from the under- neath their cuchi
Who we be?
We be the bastards who blast this suckahs with battery acid
Apathy lasted for centuries,
Cuz mentally I can destroy your enemy,
Beat him in his head til he sees ten of me
Cuz I got mental telepathy
Yo this is the epitamy
Of something that you don't think it should be
But in this vicinty it's '93
Until infinity, infinity from '93
Back even old school like '92
I can't find your crew
Oh, that was a hot qoute
Back when souls and mischief were dope,
Cuz Apathy is so hot
Check the stuff I wrote
But it stopped that I'm rockin'
Off the top of my page
As I step off the mic and pass to Sage
Sage Francis, Watch as I do dances
That are pretty dope- (laughing)
And you know I just left,
Your whole body broke
This party spoke about me after I left,
Cuz they know I stole their breath like it was a theft
I do the runnin' man
Take a quick step,
Hit the kid who played kick-step (laughing)
Back, flipped back at-
Reverse is on the tracks
Grab a knapsack, shout at your data
Cuz I be phattah than rappas,
That turn their bodies to anti-matter
Anti-matter, but nothing really does matter
Download my data into the brain,
From the dome will set the dj unknown,
Everybody knows that I'm around here
I'm full-blown...
Shatter like bones, through the headphones
Cuz Apathetic can crush all ya clones
I'll be flexin'
Ill like a science lesson
Right now I'm tryin' to rock,
And I got a sinus infection
(Sniff) Mmh, As I breathe in through my nostril
Most people that I battle-
They just end up in a hospital
So I go there with the flowers and the pot,
The pot, the flowers-
What am I sayin?
I don't know, they just all got devoured
Still I rip through mc's,
I stand 6'2
My nose is kinda runny,
I think I need a tissue
To blow out the boogers, and to blow out the snots
Cuz when Ap rocks the spot-
Everybody's on the jock
And now they're in shock,
But this is not shock therapy
This is the person that you wanna be (laughing)
This is not the enemy himself,
Lookin' inside of the mirror
Use a cd just for the reflection.
I hear ya more clearer
Take a bite out of rhymes,
But I be breakin' mc's
So take a bite out of mine
Mmh, did I digest it?
Digestion.
Inside of my small intestine.
It's longer than anything,
But my largest organ is my skin.
Do you hear this thing,
Called hip hop era, rap or rock?
Back to blues and soul,
Who stole the effects that was on my voice
I didn't want reverb, that was the choice
You talked about the skin,
Meanin' the epidermis-
Everytime I spit my verses,
People go in the stores to purchase,
Cuz Apathetic is nice...
You pray the churches to bring me back everytime,
Because you worthless and... (mumbling)
Worthless? What?
This is not a secret nor a service
Ya'll are nervous,
Like that label that had to shut down (laughing)
F'in clowns, inside of this town
A circus with microphones short circut
Yo cuz there are mad pathetic
And stay transis rockin' with Apathetic
It be- Apathetic
Yo I'm bad like credit,
Cuz mc's don't wanna step at it,
Cuz I'm magnetic, electric, affective, eclectic,
And no one said it
Ya'll wanna step, Whatever
Yo I'd step
Here I go - down
Take the elevater,
I'm pushin' buttons-
I'm struttin'
Nope I gotta limp
Aw I hurt my knee
I don't know, I'm hurbin knee
I'm hurtin' myself...
Cuz, uh virtually (laughing)
I put mc's vertically or horizontally
When I be wantin' the M-I-C
Still you couldn't see me
You better knock down my lone stuff on my mp3 uh (mumbling)
Put it on cd
Yo, did you see me on tv?
I'm talkin' about the esp
N, I don't listen to Len
Yo, I didn't you see you on that tv-
Espn, but I saw you on mtv with Carson Daly
Yo, I was flippin' him off
Because he's frickin soft.
He needed a break north of cost
Him inside of the racetrack,
He couldn't face facts,
So I shoved opinions down his throat
In my dominion, I broke everybody
Now they're just chilling in their body cast,
To make the party last (Yeah)
Yo Apathetic will bust a brain
I stole your girlfriend,
Jennifer what's her name.. (wooping)
Oh Love Hewitt (laughing)
Watch how I do it over the music
She had to take a toothpick,
To pick out all the pubics of her teeth,
When I released, (Yo) cuz I had beef
(laughing)
I know and then I went to find Natalie Port-man
I said Hi, My name is Zal Zan
I been lookin' at you from a distance,
For a long time, I even got a copy of your fingerprints
Yo, but hold up
Everytime Carson sees me, there's terror
Cuz now I'm tryin' to match his other girl,
Christina Aguilera, so now I'm 'bout to hit her up
Make her swallow and never spit it up,
I won't admit it though...
Yo- I like the kids from Hansen,
They're kinda fine lookin'
Oh yo' (mumbling) Nevermind
Forget about that,
I shoulda never spit some homo erotic ish in my rap
Yo I never speak words,
I only rap, forget all that crap
Ya'll know my first name is Ap,
So take that to the track
Bring it back, rewind it on the waxin'
Ya'll like my tracks
Yo- ya'll like my tracks a little bit better (Aar)
Up to their turtleneck,
What's up the Apathy's sweater (What)
Yo his sweatshirt, ya'll get hurt
I exert lots of ish like there's a flirt
Your a liver,
Why you look like a taxi cab driver? (Huh)
You better jump out the cipher,
Before I plug the meter
I be the cat always rockin' new sneakers
Sit home and write rhymes with two speakers
Yo I tweaked this
Look at my sneakers,
They two years old
I can't afford any new ones
They growin' mold
Where my toe jam used to be
And yo I know your type of ish and used to me
Hey yo I know your sneakers are old and they got some mold
That's probably the crap that's givin' me this --irritating cold
Yo I gotta blow my nose,
So you can sit back and kick the flows,
While I chill and oh-
Oh look at Apathy!
He's at home cryin' about his allergy (laughing)
Hey yo don't get mad at me, just because I be blastin' the G
Without a gap, just with my rap!
Yo how you get dissed?
I come back with some Primoteen mist,
Spray it through my nasal,
Grab the turntable on fatal,
I get it twisted like the dradle or a dreadlock,
Put you in a headlock,
And beat you down through the granite and bedrock
Yo, your cursed like the cursed Redsocks,
Yo you need to forget,
That I do more work that the third-country sweatshops
Forget it hops, it's done
My hair falling out of my head.. Ahhhh (laughing)
Hey yo,
How you gonna step the man,
Who will put you in your place?
When your whole career will prolley fall off,
Like Master Ace (Master Ace)
You can't even front it, step to me
Cuz I be Apathy,
Knockin' suckas out the galaxy
Like I said man,
This is somethin your just not used to
You never diss Master Ace,
Or anyone else in the Juice Crew (ohhhh)
(No, No)It didn't even come to you or I?
You want I, I'm not you,
Do or die!
I guess I'm only criminal minded,
Kinda subliminal or similar,
Cuz Apathy be rippin' ya,
Til I be tippin' ya over like the scales
It never fails, cuz Apathetic's ill
Body slam killer whales (laughing)
Or still out fail?
I don't know, that's alright,
I'll just drink up some ginger ale (laughing)
If I'm feelin' sick or stale
Yo, I used to cheat on tests,
Writing on my fingernail
Yo, I spent too much time in detention,
When I sit back and think about the high school reflections,
But still, should I mention
Or maybe it was suspension,
Sittin' at home,
I felt the tension
Made my extension,
I made friends then,
I turned them into enemies (laughing)
That's the way staged friends then
You know my steise,
Yo I left them with broken bones,
And I may pee on their face (On their face)
I peed (laughing)
Yo, like I said before
You gotta pay for the pee
My pee costs losts of money
My pee is causing pregnancy,
And all the little girls who wants a piece of the penis,
Cuz its filled with pisssss
Yo, I don't play
I'll jerk off in a cup,
And sell it on Ebay (laughing)
Yo, without no delay
We'll set the tone,
He hastn changed since forever,
I thought he was a dj (cheering)

Majority Rule (Gruvis Malt 03),UnKnown,UnKnown,"(hook)
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
I'ma take you back, take take you back
I'ma take you back, take take you back
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

I got lectured once while eating breakfast for lunch
Said dad to me ""Reality is nothing but a collective hunch
Whatever you want the truth to be, simply fool the masses
Attack them mentally with tools of power like the Masters
Get em in elementary school and college classes
Eventually you'll overrule their cowardly asses
Don't worry about society, they're all horrible bastards""
With this knowledge I blast kids. stay dark like Howard's glasses
I'm ""Stern!"" plus I rule with an iron fist
With no concern, it's so cruel, where did I learn this?
It's in my gene pool. For permanent bliss
It seems cool, only if you suffer from eternal ignorance
Internal innocence rejects external filth. Hurdle the guilt
My ancestors left. Dress with a traditional kilt
Curdled milk that's under suspicion will get spilt
Ain't no use crying. Who's lying about the empire I built?
Another self proclaimed historian
With Einstein as his passenger, and a flux capacitor in his Delorean
Rewrote my past, taught me sin
When we spoke at last he caught me in the chin
There was no need to ask, I know he fought me to win
My broken task is born again, let a new war begin
I think he saw me grin. Played my ass like a sucka
Turned that brunch between me and my father into our last supper

He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
He'll take us back, take take us back
He'll take us back, take take us back (W-W-W-Way Back!)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future, scientists will prove that we never even existed

So now I'm orphaned into this world of a rewritten past
Where they force my girl to clean and force me to sit in class
The teacher laughs as he preaches math, beats me with a staff
Because the text we read expects us to bleed each paragraph
I speed through the chapter fast. My prospectful wife
Hangs her pride at half mast, force fed domestic life
Is giving her a fat ass...she can't eat no more
""We'll see who laughs last"" is what she speaks so sure
As she sweeps the floor
Her bare feet are sore. I'd massage her toes
But she's way too busy doing dirty laundry and washing my clothes
This bastard ass took us back to the dark ages
My heart races. He's got 1 out of 3 blacks locked in cages
Sage is heading for the mic, but they blocked the stages
Dopes took his notebook, said ""Don't look!"" as they blotched the page
Ignoramuses must have ""idio-dildos"" stuck up in their anuses
Dominatrixes explain how pleasurable of a pain this is
I ain't with this game of his.I'm looking for a loophole
Just because you look the part, don't mean you can play, ask Manute Bol
My absolute role is to save whatever is left of me
The last of my true soul, so I dress up like the referee
To get the coach on every bench pissed
They approach me with a clenched fist
So I throw up their past lives and say, ""Catch this!""
They get the drift, but fans rush the court
Propaganda programs they hold in their hands
Brain washed and flushed their thought
Now it's a blood sport. My girl ain't with this strange land
She was fronting like a cheerleader as she figured out the game plan
Made peeks at play sheets, memorized them like the Rain Man
Conducted her own brain scan, then reversed the chain of command
""She learned the formulas?"" The story is unraveling
She seduced Einstein by dressing up like Marilyn..
Monroe. now she's got a Manson look in her eyes
And a grin that's stretching so wide.damn, son, I'm petrified!

She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back (Take us back back!)
She'll take us back, take take us back
She'll take us back, take take us back(W-W-W-Way Back!)
See, cuz it's twisted..
In the future scientists will prove that we never even exsssss....",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-majority-rule-gruvis-malt-03-lyrics
Slow Down Gandhi (album version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"There once was a song called ""Arrest The President.""

On my soap box yelling into megaphones
Killing hard rocks using carcasses as stepping stones
Had to promise that I'd stop holding my marches
The day that Chris Columbus got crucified on golden arches
My pedestal was too tall to climb off
In fact that's the reason for the high horse

Underdogs with wonderbras in a push-up contest
All for the sake of military recruitment

Conflict,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I would rather be
Who I'd rather be
What I would rather be...
I conflict with those who are tricked
By the gimmick market and can't think with logic
Logic!
They're in the distance when I begin to pop lip (hip)
Poppers asking why does this kid does talk shit
Just I'm never breaking even so I'm throwing art fit
Sick of rappers saying ""fresh!""
But stink like armpit
And couldn't test a single member that's within our clique
I bring it to you right now, but you don't really want it
Unwarranted, salsa make your heart skip
If you rolled as much as you told you'd get carsick
Accosted by pistol forty audience at your concert
Sitting in the front row
Getting wet by what they all spit
I'll be standing in the back hitting you with a tall stick
I could join your ass and still you're not slick
When in over your fan base
Make them say ""aw shit!""
Right in your damn face
Confidence: you lost it
Now these super thuggy dungs say
""Bring that hard shit""
In a conflict
Simple simon Simon Says to sing the pop hit
In a conflict
Corny white boys just want jokes, this isn't a comic strip
In a conflict
Still I bring a conflict, that sting of conflict
I'm in a conflict
I'd rather be artistic
Painting pictures with my words while freaking a topic
Your broad strokes are filled with lead
So what you're eating's toxic
But this poison is self-destruction, you're feeling
Stop it!
Taking more than god's name in vain
Making your beating heart quit
Push you on the floor, then pull the carpet
Out from under your feet, then watch you drop quick
Flying through the airwaves, hit you with a dropkick
On the WWF raw is war tip
Run up in your crib and watch that horse strip
Playing healthy mind games to keep her thoughts sick
The plot is not the only thing that thickens in this porn flick
Once I'm done when her, you really think she wants your dick?
That's not how I'd rather be
This is not who I would rather be
That's not how I'd rather be
I am not lit
Hitting on some club hopping bot chick
Start to flit, name-dropping on a superstar trip
Only for the sake of seeing her jump on the jock quick
Simply get that cock trick spit what your mom drink
Now, back to these bastards who claim they got grip
Take the finger off your safety and let the Glock click
Aim for the back of my fist, make it your target
Stigmata
I let the blood from my palms drip
I've got a cold of socials in the arctic
Single-handedly rip through your family
Make it look like a mob hit
Better stiffing if your biscuit got limp
I go down head down like Fred Durst
For a hot lick of this lolly pop stick
Sick of suckers thinking they can rock it
Hip hop rip offs over a good tall lick
That little bitch'll slit her wrist
With this good tar pick
I stick to my convictions
That don't make me a convict
I compliment only those who deserve the props, prick

Underbite Ben Finds God,Road Tested,2006.0,"I remember once I found God.
He was so happy. I found him in the card catalog at the public library.
Nobody looks there anymore.
Thanks to Dewy decimal I found him.
Feasting on his manhood just to stay alive.
He could have feasted off that monster for centuries.
Serious, he was hung like this.
You figure finding god might win you automatic entry into Hellven, but no.
I have to fool myself there, just like everybody else.
Then I said, ""Ah, can I get three wishes!?""
""I'm not that kind of god"", he said.
He did teach me sign language so I wouldn't have to fog up my mirror with these long winded self-evaluations every morning.
""Look at you, concave man.""
You know what concave means? We have a young crowd.
It means I have an inny instead of an outty.
The best thing about being concave, besides having your balls look so huge and out of place, it's the midgets.
They crawl inside and paint pictures on the wall.
A little person died there once.
That's what I mean when I mention the ghosts.
I'm haunted, down there.
Welcome to my world.
It's a world where all the well endowed animals of this planet simultaneously die from a horrible case of womb envy.
It's a world where Natalie Portman stalks me,
And she's still 14,
And it's OK, 'cause it's my world baby.
It's a world where when you multiply a negative number by a negative number, you don't get a positive number,
You get a bigger negative number!
And I don't have to *beat boxes* to keep you interested.
Mommies don't die, she never left me, and there's not dark sweat marks where my fucking heart should be.
When I fly, it's first class bitch.
All they serve is vegetarian meals on my flight.
The guy on the side of me's pissed.
""Excuse me. Please check the back, see if you got one with chicken in it maybe? Maybe someone could get me chicken?""
""I'm sorry sir, you gotta call forty-eight hours ahead of time to get your meat meal.""
He's none too pleased, so he calls me on his cellphone, to tell me about his, superbowl show!
I don't know! Wanna flow? Go to go, toe to toe. I don't rock Polo.
He gets bombarded by these public service announcements that let him know,
""You supported terrorism by paying taxes! And driving all over the place, you could have just fucking walked down the street.""
Fact!
And I laughed, all the way to the sperm banks, soccer mom.
Haha, it's not my world, it's his.
The big white guy in the sky.
I'm stuck down here, looking into my foggy mirror, peering into my concave,
practicing my math on all you poor aborted fetus's.
Reminding myself how far away I am from God.
I chopped off my dick, shoved it into my asshole, and smuggled it out of the country,
For you!",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-underbite-ben-finds-god-annotated
The Weak Link,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Written By: Sage Francis
Verse One:
The weak link is quivering...determining the chain's strength/
Wimpering...VIBRATING...the wave length/
Of its stress signals are more or less symbols. It just trembles/
Knowing it'll take the weight when the chain breaks and disassembles/
See Mr. Wendell? He knew nothing of this daily struggle/
Sit under the disfunctional family tree and prepare for trouble/
Could barely hear the mumbles beneath the ear peircing rumbles/
Sharp tongues slashing mouths while lashing out with verbal belt buckles/
Friends crumble under similar circumstances within their own chain of events/
From Sloppy knots in family ties. The pain is intense/
The tension is thick. Two sided arguments are upsetting to him/
Stretching the link. testing its endurance and spreading it thin/
TREMBLING...holding onto what's familia in the Italian sense and reading intense drafts/
By Sylvia Plath/
Breaking off into an unfamilliar path/
Divert the hurt by faking coughs, trying to act silly and laugh/
Making light of situations when I sense a panic attack/
I'm a fully licensed self-defense machanic, and my toolbelt is black
She probably thinks I'm dead
She's probably dead
When he left she said I was so strong, I know she's wrong...
I need back support. My knees fold
Please hold your end of the bargain when I leave home
Please hold the keystone
Verse Two:
The weak link is feeling emense stress from a tense situation
Stretching out in every direction and visibly shaken
Its mistaken as durable, listen...
Its just the circumstance that has it standing in a verticle position
Hurting from the friction of abrasive personal differences
People lose their grip when hands slip, and it gets worse when fingers give
The Lying Tamer is in the middle of the three-ring-circus. ""Bring the kids!""
Hanging by the last string it swings
Cling to live. Strain to see. Gasp to breathe
The father figure is...breaking free...he has to leave
I figure its...making me...want to pass the seeds
The baby sitter grins...vacantly...lying in dead grass and leaves
Laughing at trees. They hold their own
Forbidden fruit of their manual labor pains don't fall far from their home
Every autumn calls for another poem devoted to growing old
Every winter seems to get colder and colder...its that same old story overtold
Let go of your hold...become a missing link in the chain effect
Out on the open road...kids'll think you became a wreck
When hopeless souls begin to sink and disconnect
Its just a release
Its such a relief
Sometimes, we need to be alone
But please hold your end of the bargain when I leave home
Please hold...the keystone",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-the-weak-link-lyrics

Peace
Shut the fuck up
And I don't know their looking dead tonight (x3)
Ain't looking like they got the strength to fight
Switch up your pulse patterns
What's the RPM of your breath
Kickstart your heart with a punch
Beating your chest
Squeezing your head till I pop vessels in your eye sockets
We talk your ears off till your blood pressure sky rockets
If ? check for lumps in your throat
Before you burn a bridge jump in a moat
Depending on whether you float or sink
Know how to swim or can't
You know what to think before you provoke some shit
Between concentration camp counselors
Giving first aid training
Mouth to mouth recessitate
Lady faint
When I see her face fading
I make her suck wind
Bring her vibrant colors back
See if she has any contacts
And find out where her mothers at
Said she had my number
But nothing other than that
When she said my number's up I laughed
The EMS came running back
Doing suicides the relay race of time
And space between me and destiny
But I leave no trace to find
She leaves nowhere to hide
I leave no hide to wear
Skin myselffeed my bones
Dress up in some tribal gear
Mummified every time I lived in the now
If you don't want to die
Then come alive and don't give your number out
Count down till the end of my show
Shout loud if you ain't ready to go
The out crowd might never know
Why I'm trying to find vital signs
And I don't know their looking dead tonight (x3)
Ain't looking like they got the strength to fight
Through the rest of the night
Their looking dead tonight (x3)
Ain't looking like they got the strength to fight",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-iceland-radio-intro-vital-signs-lyrics
Hey Bobby (a cappella explicit),UnKnown,UnKnown,"AUTHOR: Sage Francis
By the time the flags rotted off of their antennas
They were questioning who the real threat is
Big Brotherly love is the 21rst Century's plague
No matter how bloody the glove, question evidence displayed
Don't forget what two plus two equals
Don't let them upgrade your math no matter what they have as proof of evil
Remember when they went after the Jewish people?
You don't recognize that same black mask as see through?
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed and a house that wasn't haunted
I'd rather die for a cause than to die just because
We exhaust natural resources forced into wars
Restoring wasteful ways, keeping other countries poor
""Monkey see, Monkey do"" I wonder what those fucking monkeys saw
Keep rethinking the still-frames in your mind
And guarantee they will change with time
Your outline is pixelated with poor resolution while
Downtime is simply wasted. You were born execution style
Head first in a trial. I'll second the motion
'Til the jury's bored to death and puts your neck in a notion
The situation's volatile. A naked problem child
Is trying to find the right clown costume to make his father smile
So he bombs while he tries to tell jokes
This ain't a false alarm, can't you smell the smoke?
You're in the line of fire where they buy and sell votes
Our sense of liberty doesn't ring true, stupid, that's why the bell broke
Trench coat Mafiosos propel rocks
At recruitment officers and rebel against cops
'Til they hurdle infinite circles in small cell blocks
Turtle upon turtle 'til they're all shell shocked
This so-called president got elected in a court room
With the war efforts of pops he inherited a fortune
We ""talk, talk, talk..."" so the veterans of war assume
The revolution stopped. This ain't a protest tune
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays.""
You can't roam a lost land as the last existing dinosaur
There's no escaping ass kickings in these times of war
Replacing apples with hospitals...where doctors are hostile
Killing two pterodactyls with one fossil
I got you. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in it's bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...and house that wasn't haunted
Thumb through novels to have your fingerprints match
The description of criminals committing innocent acts
Of compassion for tired civilians crawling with pistols
While we fire million dollar warning missals
Force the issues in the back of your head where eyes roll
Brain wash yourself out of that mind control
Or act a fool like you're told
But we won't see no type of justice 'til that bitch removes the blindfold
This ain't a ""Love it or leave it,"" it's a ""Change it or lose it.""
I'll never sing the anthem of a nation who never faces the music
Chasing an ever-elusive caveman
In space ships that makes trips to the futures that are name-brand
Faking progress...but we ain't advanced
Enough to change the posture of our ape stance?
They've got the key to the city but they prefer the break-in entry
Duck and weave, I'm shedding light in their shadow box to make it empty
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fuckin' skin decays.""
Attack of the eagles. If they don't fall dead
Before they reach me, I'll be damned if I don't shoot one in its bald head
Fuck what we're force fed. All I ever wanted
Was a warm bed...
There's nothing scarier than the human stories I tell ghosts
Chilling accounts with my tongue frozen to bed posts
The catharses of carcasses whenever threats are close
Shows a heartlessness that doesn't register on stethoscopes
Sell your hopes for a homeland security chart
'Til your sense of self is broke and no man's pure in the heart
Preventive detention for the folks who never left home
Tensions have grown into a 24/7 red zone
Scare tactics...have got you under control
The fear factors of a color code. The uppers know
They can't hold you down without having anchors attached
""It's all the same."" Nah, balls and chains on ankles don't match
So drag your torso back to the off road
We may have lost the fashion battle but we ain't lost the wardrobe
Go window shopping for your next free meal
Cuz when we start the revolution all you'll probably do is steal
""Hey, Bobby...the Masters are back. They're up to no good just like the old days
They played dead when you stood over their grave, Bobby. They played dead when you stood over their grave
""Hey, Bobby...them bastards are back. It's our turn to stand over their grave
I'm a do it right this time...I'm awake...I'm a wait until their fucking skin decays.""",https://genius.com/Sage-francis-hey-bobby-a-cappella-explicit-lyrics
Slow Down Gandhi (clean version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"There once was a song called ""Arrest The President.""
Contemporary music, a hit with the kids, it was a top ten
I wasn't pop then, so I missed the bus a bit
But politics was on everybody's hot this summer list
The cool kids were all rocking votes
I shit you not, I was pistol whippin' cops for hip hop. (Booyea!)
On my soap box yelling into megaphones
Killing hard rocks using carcasses as stepping stones
Had to promise that I'd stop holding my marches
The day that Chris Columbus got crucified on golden arches
My pedestal was too tall to climb off
In fact that's the reason for the high horse
And from up here I see Marines and Hummers on a conquest;
Underdogs with wonderbras in a push-up contest
All for the sake of military recruitment
It felt like Kent State the way they targeted the students
I galloped off whistling ""Ohio.""
The rest of them, stuck doing stand up at a cricket convention
What would they die for? (repeat)
Is it the same machine that leaves the quality of life poor?
An abominable colony of cyborgs?
Clogging up the property that I bought with eyesores?
That clever ad campaign ain't worth
The time taken from minimum wage labor;
I don't care how half-naked or fake she looks
She smells like dirty cash and aged paper books
What would she die for?
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' em
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' em
Now it's whistle blower vs. the pistol holder;
Case dismissed, they'll lock you up and throw away the key witness
Justice is the whim of a judge, check his chest density
It leaves much room for error, and the rest left to destiny
The West Memphis 3 lost paradise
It's death penalty vs. suicidal tendencies
All I wanted was a fucking Pepsi
Institution
Making you think you're crazy is a billion dollar industry
If they could sell sanity in a bottle
They'd be charging for compressed air
And marketing healthcare
They demonize welfare
Middle class eliminated
Rich get richer til the poor get educated
But some of y'all still haven't grown into your face
And your face doesn't quite match your head
And I'm waiting for a brain to fill the dead space that's left
You're all, ""Give me ethnicity or give me dreads.""
Trustafundian rebel without a cause for alarm
Cause when push turns to shove
You jump into your forefathers arms
He's a banker, you're part of the system
Off go the dreadlocks in comes the income
The briefcase (the freebase)
The sickness (the symptom)
When the cameras start rollin' stay the fuck outta the picture pilgrim!
The briefcase (the freebase)
The sickness (the symptoms)
When the cameras start rollin'...
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin' em
Mr. Save The World, spare us the details
Save the females from losing interest
And Miss Save The Universe
You're a damsel in distress
Tied down to a track of isolated incidents
Generalize my disease
I need a taste of what it's like
Living off the fat of kings
I play the scab at your hunger strike
Slow down Gandhi, you're killin'em
One love, one life, one too many victims
Republicrat, Democran, one party system
Media goes in a frenzy
They're stripped of their credentials
Presidential candidates can't debate over this instrumental
Let 'em freestyle, winner takes all
When the music's dead, I'll have Ted Nugent's head hangin' on my wall
Kill one of ours, we'll kill one of yours
With some friendly fire, that's a funny term, like civil war
Six in the morning, police at my crib
Now my nights consist of two toothpicks and eyelids
The crucifix and vitamins, music that is pirated
New flavored food made of mutated hybrids
Uh, they tell me that it's not that bad
It fucks you up good, but its not that bad
They hold on to these tales till it's the dog that wags
God save us all if he lets the cat out the bag
Who's the one to blame for this strain in my vocal chords?
Who can pen a hateful threat but can't hold a sword?
It's the same who complain about the global war
But can't overthrow the local joker that they voted for
They call the shots
(but they're not in the line of fire)
I call the cops
(but they're breakin the line of duty)
Lets call a stop to the abuse of authority
The truth keeps callin' me, and I'ma live to tell the story
So look for truth, quit seeking forgiveness
You need to cut the noose, but you don't believe in scissors
You support the troops by wearing yellow ribbons?
Just bring home my motherfuckin' brothers and sisters
Cause they don't call the shots
(but they're in the line of fire)
I'd like to call the cops
(but they're breakin' the line of duty)
It's time to call a stop
(To the abuse of authority)
The truth keeps calling me
And I'ma live to tell the story
(Meadow superstar
That is what you are
Coming from a farm
Reaching with your arm
Come away with me
To another ranch
We can rely on a tree-branch
