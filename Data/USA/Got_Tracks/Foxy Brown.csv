I’ll Be,Ill Na Na,1997.0,"That's right, papa, that's right
How we doin', yeah, Ill Na Na
Uh huh, uh, come on

What up pop? brace yourself as I ride on top
Close your eyes as you ride right out your socks
Double, lose his mind as he grind in the tunnel
Wanna give me the cash he made off his last bundle
Nasty girl, don't pass me the world
I push the V, not the backseat girl
Don't deepthroat for c-notes, she floats
Murder she wrote and keeps the heat close
Firm nigga, we 'posed to be the illest on three coasts
Familia, bigger than Icos
Y'all Danny DeVitos, small niggas
All I see is the panty eaters, that's all, niggas
Loan sharkin' this year, raise the figgas
Fifteen percent make the whole world sit up
And take notice, Na Na take over
Y'all take quotas to hit papa

Straight out the gate y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure
(I'll be good)
That's right we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure
(I'll be good)

I'm too live, nasty as I wanna be
Don't shake your sassy ass in front of me
'Fore I take you there and tear your back out
That shit ain't happened since The Mack was out
I'm Lola Falana, dripped in Gabbana
Nineties style, the finest style
Right away it's the fit, wanna taste the shit
Put me on the basin, throw your face in it, fucker
Na Na, y'all can't touch her
My sex drive all night like a trucker
Let alone the skills I possess
And y'all gon' see by these mil's I possess
Never settle for less, I'm in excess
Not inexpensive VVS
To the two, that's just the way I'm built
Nasty, but classy, still

Straight out the gate y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure
(I'll be good)
That's right we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure
(I'll be good)

Well you can hold what I got, roll with the Roc
A-Fella capo in the candy apple drop
Will tears fall to your ears if I don't stop?
Can ya throw it like a quarterback, third and a lot?

Dig me, I'll get you locked like Biggie with herb in the spot
Word middie, the cop 'n biddie
Uhh, I'm the bomb-diggy, punana
Sexy brown thing, uh, Madon' y'all
Make 'em turn over from the full-court pressure
To undress ya and shit all over your asses
I ain't playin' knockin' out at the weigh-in
I'm sayin', what's the sense in delayin'
I'm tryin to run G from the P to the A.M
I saw your little thing now I'm swayin', OK'in

Straight out the gate y'all, we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure
(I'll be good)
That's right we drop hits
Now tell me, how nasty can you get
All the way from the hood to your neck of the woods
It's ripped, one thing for sure

Get Me Home,Ill Na Na,1996.0,"Uh, yeah
(Ay-ayy)
Firm biz
, what it is, Blackstreet
Na Na, steady rise, peep that out
Oooh, 
(baby)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
(Gotta get you home)

Hold up, let's take it from the top, I Fox
Gets my swerve on, floss pure rocks
In the six drop boo and it don't stop
See money lookin' alright, yeah, what up Pop?
Cross the room throwin' signals, I'm throwin' 'em back
Flirt-in 'cause I digs you like that
Peep baby boy style, hopin' we match
You sent me Crown Royale with a note attached
It said, ""You look like the type that know what you like""
I could tell by the je-wels you go for the ice
Plus you wear the shoes well, the suit flows nice
I don't like the notes too well, let's be more precise
Meet me by the VIP, let's pow-wow
Whisper in my ear like, ""Boo, let's bounce now""
I'm 'bout to say peace to my mans for you
When it's all said and done I got plans for you
He said

Oooh baby
(Gotta get you home with me)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Oooh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight
C'mon, c'mon

At the bar high-post, frontin', I toast
Gettin' my flirt on, playa, ain't nothin'
You tryna say the right words to get us out of here
Jackpot, what he said, ""It's bullshit in here""
And his smile blind like the shine on his necklace
Mind tellin' me no, body tellin' me exit
Breasts said yes, give me more wet kisses
Uh, twist my body like the Exorcist, hey
The way he licked his lips he was mackin'
True thug passion, I'm like, ""Slow down before you crashin'""
Never mind him, he ain't thinkin' 'bout you
Or the way we sex, on the villa up in Malibu
Marry who? Daddy please
I'm takin' it all from the stash to the keys, so let me see
Boo, I'm 'bout to dead my mans for you
When it's all said and done I got plans for you
He said

Oooh baby
(I need you, want you in my life)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
(Gotta get you home with me tonight)
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Oooh baby
(Baby, I need you right here)
Gotta get you home with me tonight

Grabbed me by the hand and led the way
Outside of the club talkin' to valet
Mind started to stray million miles away
Contemplatin' goin' back to his crib to par-lay
Jumped in the passenger seat, relaxed my feet
As he threw on Blacksteet casually
And we cruised the metro, on premium petrol
Eyes sized up my thighs and couldn't let go
Ta-Ta's perkin', you're makin' me high like Toni
Work me, take me, I'm hot
I thought for a second and then my mind went
Sex all around the car, isn't it ironic?
Back to reality, the Soul II Soul
Breathin' heavily but still in control
Wants the shy girl role, put my hand on his leg
With sex in his eyes, he turned and then he said

(Tonight baby)
Oooh baby
(C'mon, c'mon, Foxy c'mon)
Gotta get you home with me tonight
(Whatever you want me to do)
Uh-oh, uh-oh 
(do it for you, baby)
Oooh baby
(I need it in my life)
Gotta get you home with me tonight",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-get-me-home-lyrics

I'm a rockin Timbs bitch and the Gucci loafers girl
Niggas say I'm too pretty to spit rhymes this gritty
Fuck y'all thought? Be dancin around in suits like I'm {​Diddy}​

It's like I'm in my own fuckin world, I speak how I feel
Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin real
I love to stack riches, no disrespect y'all
I respect the rap game, but I don't fuck with rap bitches
I'm speakin from my heart
It's not that I'm too good, I'm just hood
Been like this from the fuckin start
Since I bust my gun in ninety-six
Y'all never see me flick up with them fake-ass chicks
Bitches smile up in your face, turn around and pop shit
You a industry bitch, I'm a in the streets bitch
I might breeze through Prada, Chloe or Tiffs
But, other than that it's just me and my six
Repeat 1

I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed it with the Trini' rum and whiskey
Uhh, proper set off
Six sped off, gats let off, I speak calm
Gangsta, and pose off like Screechie Dan, bwoy
Who y'all know rock Prada like Fox
Pop bottles in the back of the cellar with Donatella
Cartier wrist wear, Pasha Kay face
Got niggas stand in line just to get a sneak taste
Act like y'all don't know I keeps gat beneath waist
And like a hundred thou' each crib in each safe
When Fox come through she  ah go dun di place
I'm like Marion Jones, what, who the FLUCK wan' race?
Listen, never trippin, never catch Brown slippin
Fuck, y'all only nice around mics like Pippen
Shit, to all my thugs that's Blood'n or Crip'n

Foxy Brown, the Ill Na Na (yeah, c'mon, yeah, c'mon)
Destination... (c'mon, c'mon) plat'

Yo Na Na so Ill, 
first week out
Shipped a half a mil, niggas freaked out
She's all about sex, pard-on, check your facts
And the track record, I'm all about plaques
Shaking my ass half naked, lovin this life
Waiting for Kim album to drop, knowin it's tight
Standing center stage, closin the show holdin a gat
Since you opened up, I know you're hoping it's wack
Niggas, screaming my name on record straight whylin
Maybe I'll answer back when you reach a hundred thousand
This is ladies night, and the Mercedes's tight
When I'm coming home? Maybe tonight
Leave my food by the microwave, kiss the baby goodnight
It's my time to shine it's playtime tonight
I'mma try to stand my ground, know when I fall
I left your ass Home Alone, hopin I call

Who's got the illest pussy on the planet?
Sugar walls comin down niggas can't stand it, the Ill Na Na
True Absolut Vodka, straight shots
For the has-beens and have-nots, dolla dolla
Real and it don't stop, we moving up
First the mansion then the yacht, sound proper
Straight cash get got, bloodhounds
Tryin to hunt down the Brown Fox, the Ill Na Na

No more sexing me all night, thinking it's alright
While I'm lookin over your
Shoulder, watching the hall light
You hate when it's a ball right? Ladies this ain't handball
Nigga hit these walls right before I call Mike
In the morning when it's all bright, eggs over easy
Hope you have my shit tight when I open my eyes
While I'm eating getting dressed up, this ain't yo' pad
I left some money on the dresser, find you a cab
No more, sharin I pain, sharing I made
It's time to outslick niggas, ladies sharing our game
Put it in high gear, flip the eye wear
Nas Ruled the World but now it's my year
And from, here on I solemnly swear
To hold my own like Pee Wee in a movie theater
 (uh-huh)
Yeah I don't need a man's wealth (yeah)
But I can do bad (bad) by my damn self (self)
And uhh..


Uhh... vodka..
Not... not..
Dolla dolla... stop stop..
C'mon c'mon... yah, it's the Ill Na Na

No more Waitin To Exhale, we takin deep breaths
Ladies take this over, I be Fox so peep this
Love thyself with no one above thee
Cause ain't nobody gon' love me like me
If he, don't Do The Right Thing like Spike Lee
Bye bye wifey make him lose his Nike's (uh uh, yeah)

Hot Spot,Chyna Doll,1998.0,"Ayo! Rhyme or crime, let's get it on
MC's wanna eat me but it's Ramadan
Peep what's on the arm, when it's ice it's ice
When I'm right, I'm right, when you're wrong, you're wrong
I'm the bomb, records is platinum, skin is bronze
Flows all night like vintage Dom
Been this nice since umm, the first Prince bomb
Before ""The Artist Was Known As"" wit my grown ass
Haters said it won't last, know how many birds I flown past
Celly on roam, full belly, first class
And I don't play, I watch them pockets
Know y'all niggas go broke after you cop them watches
See you in the club, no bub' nigga pop it
Then you wanna fuck, give it up nigga, not this
My coat is ostrich, flow is the hottest
You ain't got dough, you can't go with the Fox bitch

You can catch me at the hot spot cause I Fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the hot spot, I Fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls

Yo! Cats bustin out the six, cash flushin out the niggas
Platinum heart in half hangin 'tween the two tit-ties
Scheme on your team, lookin over graph pictures
Pick the finest, then I put it on the minors
Love, after the club, meet me at the diner
So you can bring your boys, we got ten cars behind us
Order a steak, a glass of OJ to break-fast
Hop in the car and head straight up Eighth Ave
The night is young, I'm likin son
Either he don't have one, or his wife is dumb
His whole hand numb, nigga iced his thumb
Pull up my tights some, enticin him
You can handle the work, I'll play wit it
Til he curve and swerve nigga, stay wit it
Bitches in the club they, hated it
Cause I put my mack down then I, skated it

You can catch me at the hot spot cause I Fox, I plots
At the bar y'all, all night, I pops
Is it alright, sho' you right, you can't stop it
This is our world, me and my girls
You can catch me at the hot spot, I Fox, I plots

You can catch me at the Expo', Jacob Jav
Knocking Jigga out the Navigator, layin back, I stay in that
Me fallin off? Imagine that, it's not the case
I'm sittin' on Top of the World like Brandy and Mase
You wanna, buy me a drink, nigga hand me a case
Big ballin bitch, I want all of this shit
Six AMG's with the spoiler kit
Chromes from the fac', phones front and back
CoCo, flow, niggas is wantin that
Out they vehicles, niggas is bumpin that
I heard you wanna stop Fox, tell me how so
I got that New York, to the Dirty South flow
Whole album hot, even the outro
This time around I'm tryin to do about fo'
This is for my niggas and bitches who count dough
And y'all in the club I make 'em bounce

How you expect me to love you
When I can't even trust you, uh, huh

So he played you, right?
Shot a little game then he blazed you, right?
Talkin' 'bout he was gon' make you wife then make you right
And the last you seen was his car brake lights
He fooled you girl, pussy is power, let me school you girl
Don't get up off it 'til he move you girl
And let no playin' nigga rule your world and screw you girl
I got 'em hatin' me
I throws the pussy down, keep 'em chasin' me
Basically, niggas game a lot, so bet I game back
And make the nigga think that I came a lot
And I change the plot, when we was at Jacob
That chain was hot, is he on or what?
Nigga copped the broach, and the double R
And you got the notes, so I know you not broke, nigga

(I ain't fuckin' wit' you)
I can't rock with you no more
(You and your bullshit)
(How can I love you)
(Can't even trust you)

I got 'em mad at Fox, 'fore I let a nigga just stab the box
I gotta have some rocks
Even then all I do is get they asses hot
Then I ask them when was the last time you had some twat?
Put 'em right in his place, saw him right down
Shake it right in his face, you like the waist?
By the way baby boy, would you like a taste?
Let me tell you what I need on those license plates
""Property of Mahogany Brown"", standin' knock-kneed
On the balcony while you knock me down
Ya'll wanna break me off without cakin' me off?
Then expect the bitch to be faithfull to y'alls
The next nigga copin' me bags straight from Dior
Prada shoes, that's the bomb straight outta Milan
And I'm about that money, no need to pretend
Why don't you holla at me when you ready to spend?

(I ain't fuckin' wit' you)
I can't rock with you no more
(You and your bullshit)
(How can I love you)
(Can't even trust you)

You got as much, you game's y'all
And I can spit it nigga, same as y'alls, same shoes, same cars
Ain't like a chick ain't bawlin' herself
Can you give me mo', then I'm holdin' myself
I ain't tryin' to trip on no dick
I ain't tryin' to have no cat laid up in my shit
Had the next bitch layed up in my six?
Gigglin', dizzy as shit, is it sick?
I'm what a nigga would love to have
Chick with her own, nice tits, nice ass
Nice attitude even though I might spaz
He was still quite fast, you like the wife style
Cuz you know that I come out ready to dumb out
In house shoes, slippers, put it down for my niggas
And I ain't goin' front, I'm about my end, so
Holla at me when you ready to spend

(I ain't fuckin' wit' you)
I can't rock with you no more
(You and your bullshit)
(How can I love you)

What the *plurrr is this, YO!
They say I'm 730, say I spaz out
FB is ill, she'll wild out
Can y'all feel my pain?
I can't let it slide
How could I smile when I'm hurtin' so bad inside?
Yo how can we start this
My life is thorough never heartless
I laid it down from the Gate to the St Louis arches
From the windy city to the streets in Cali
To them streets in Houston
My niggas always boostin'
Some bitches always holla
How they don't spend a dolla
But that's because they ain't got it
Now tell me where's the logic
And if I talk it - I've done did it or about to do it
I'm making anthems, got a million niggas bouncin' to it
Bust your guns!
And if that ain't enough then bust again
I've been thuggin' since B-I-Z made ""Just A Friend""
Matter of fact ever since Flavor Flav was rockin' clocks
And even then there was no bitch that could compare to Fox
Let me head knock, Pretty you wit' me right
This Prada fit me tight, this Gucci fit me right
Who could quickly write like seven joints and it be tight?
You know how hood we sound, you know it's Boogie Brown

How could I smile when I'm hurtin' so bad inside?
Yo my life is full of problems
Sometimes it's hard to dodge 'em
So much you couldn't fathom
I wish I didn't have them
They say I'm 7-30, pretty but I rap too dirty
The law is criticizing me and probably never heard me
So what I crashed my Range
My last name ain't changed
This time it's different though
I'm not exploiting names
Yeah I write my shit
It's not a fucking game
So what he wrote some songs
I blew him up the same
I'm never ducking dames
Y'all know just where to find me
I would've killed her but it just wouldn't be fair to mommie
Imagine me doing time, Foxy behind bars
Not me the crime star
Y'all bitches ain't worth it
Although my life ain't perfect, I'll never change a thing
Y'all want success but y'all don't know about the pain it bring
It's supposed to make you happy and keep your paper long
This beat is kind of ill
How could you hate this song?
Yo they say I'm 730, say I spaz out
FB is ill, she'll wild out
But can y'all feel my pain?
I can't let it slide
How could I smile when I'm hurtin' so bad inside?

Man some hoes is always yackin'
Like I can't make it happen
Like they don't know my cash
Like they don't know my past
Especially pop star bitches with the soft image
So what I ain't with him
BITCH! He's off limits
Be where I always be
See who I choose to see
Although we're not together, his heart belong to me
See at times I think y'all bitches be confusing me
Like I'm somethin' sweet, shorty I'm still street
You're not on my level, and I won't stoop
And I'm the one that got you, kicked out your own group
Chicks be always thinkin' that I'mma let it ride
I might not kill you but I'll hurt you till your dead inside
Third album and you still wanna test Brown
I'm so hood bitches know how boogie get down
It could be real drama
It's still the Ill Na Na
There ain't a bitch wilda
Any beef? Holla!
They say I'm 730, say I spaz out
FB is ill, she'll wild out
But can y'all feel my pain?
I can't let it slide

Whattup Firm, we got these niggas cornered, so maintain
I got the drugs here, under the master bed behind the back stairs
Like twenty grams plus the caravan
I left the keys by the safe, erase the phone and flip the license plate
Got all the phone calls taped, and all the weights and ice
To get the dough and the guns, and then we straight
He had the block locked he knew the spot block
On some real web shit to get your spot knocked by killer cops
Tryin to get your shit rocked, he don't know, cause all along
We was plottin to drop on the low, he straight snitch
He don't know how it go, he saw Nas in all the Lex
Then a triple GS, foreala, I kinda think he got a
Feeling I'm squealing me and Tone was on the phone
Probably thinkin we dealin this bug, make sure Un got all the guns
His man Son had the whole mob of arsons
Runnin through Parsons

I mean damn, me and you forever, hand in hand
I'm married to The Firm boo, you got ta understand
I'll die for em, gimme a chair and then I'll fry for em
And if I got ta take the stand, I'mma lie for em (lie for em)
It's me and you, hand in hand (hand in hand)
I'm married to The Firm boo, you got ta understand (forever we)
I'll die for em, gimme a chair and then I'll fry for em (Nas, AZ)
And if I got ta take the stand, I'mma lie for em

Check it peep the plot, so when I beep him y'all be creepin
Cormega know the spot, diminish him, 'Mega finish him
We power, the whole team shinin through like Ma rule
Worse come to worse we got shorties layin on forty-first
They want The Firm som'in awful, to tax som'in
The way we style have a nigga tryin to blast som'in
I guess the way we politic em probably got the niggas
I know they layin like ""Dunn, we got ta stick them niggas""
In due time, they probably see the Apple sour
And once, we takin over, they'll realize The World is Ours
The faggot niggas don't deserve bein CREAM
A bunch of snitches on the same team, tryin to reign supreme
Brooklyn Queens thing, we lionhearted never dear departed I mean
You're fuckin with Scarlett O'Hara
Desert em like Sahara, shit you never heard The Firm strictly murderous
Gun is out punana, The Firm's First Lady organizer

G'damn, me and you forever, hand in hand
I'm married to The Firm boo, you got ta understand
I'll die for em, gimme a chair and then I'll fry for em
And if I got ta take the stand, I'mma lie for em
It's me and you, hand in hand
I'm married to The Firm boo, you got ta understand
I'll die for em, gimme a chair and then I'll fry for em
And if I got ta take the stand, I'mma lie for em

The General, SOSA, my partner in crime, Nas and 'Mega
Gon' cry together, shit get real, we gon' die together
I'm like whatever for my team through the cheddah
Through the CREAM we gonna stay together, it's Doe or Die
Through the slanted eyes, I organize family style
Lady Godiva, forever Firm Fox Boogie never lonely
We were wed in Holy Matrimony, whatever
Whichever, however, uhh, Firm style

I mean damn, me and you forever, hand in hand
I'm married to The Firm boo, you got ta understand
I'll die for em, gimme a chair and then I'll fry for em
And if I got ta take the stand, I'mma lie for em
It's me and you hand in hand
I'm married to The Firm boo, you got ta understand
I'll die for em, gimme a chair and then I'll fry for em

Y'all know me right?
I'm that same bitch y'all niggas want for half price
Same bitch y'all niggas be blamin' all y'all problems on
I'm the reason why half y'all niggas can't even go in your moms' crib no more

I'm the type of bitch leave a nigga nose stiff
And get his hoes hit, make his toes shift
Tell the mans and them, look, y'all ain't have shit
'Til y'all motherfuckers switch and smoke this shit
The reason Mike fucked around and moped his bitch
In his jones, little son Troy is loc-ed and shit
I ain't the cause of niggas with knives that tote this shit
It's when they spit cuz niggas came up real short with they shit
Numb a nigga like novicane, straight to the brain
Shoot it up and get both his nose and toes at the same
Nigga's gave me nickname, Chyna, last name White
Guaranteed to have your ass open first night
Bad bitch, slanted eyes, powdered with white
Somethin' special, not your average baddest little thing in sight
I know this dude Ritz that fucked with a bitch
Get you right, matter of fact, dude could get her half price
No shit, she got a crew that ain't nothin nice, dime shit
Had y'all motherfuckers believin' that y'all can fly and shit
Matter fact Mel, used to fuck a girl Trish gal
Unique hit little E and bomb bags heroin
Now they assed out, in the hood massed out
Avirex and Tim's fucked up with they gats out
Wit no love

Nana, Nana, I need ten dollars, Nana
Baby, I can't give you no more money
What you mean you can't give me no money?
Man, boy, where's my TV?
Nana, I smoked the TV

Uh, no love, changed a few thugs, new drugs
Niggas started stashin' things on Mother Gasten
Hottest shit to hit the streets, divide peeps
Divide crew love, fuck trees, now it's OZ's
Small leaks and niggas with false leads and nosebleeds
Vein popped, pop shells and close sales
Bitches, they nose frail, got the word that coke sale
Uh, flip it once you can match a nigga bail
Uh, flip it twice you officially on
Had the richest niggas fucked up, kissin' your thong
Mystery's on
Uh, flip it three times, you straight, crib on a lake
Cristal and cheese cake, cock sucker d shake, niggas flake
Huh, flip it once more, you're leary, huh
Feds in your ass, skid money don't make money
What happened to get money? The bitches, the cars and brick money
The spot on Bain Bridge
Y'all niggas ain't claimin' shit now, huh
Y'all know me now, fucked up in the game

My Life,Chyna Doll,1999.0,"(Nigga, uh)
Yeah, huh (nigga uh)
Why don't ya'll take a look into my life?
See what I see
(Nigga uh, nigga, nigga, nigga uh)

At the age of fourteen, introduced to coupes
Learnin' how to seduce niggas takin' they loot
Quickly, got involved with this money lifestyle
The finer things, all kinda things, power, money
Cars and diamond rings, in 9th grade flauntin'
The Gucci boots with the G's on it
A high price for this 'high price' life
While I'm on tour is my man cheatin' just for spite?
And if you only knew I hold my minks at nights with cheap
Or no other hands can hold me right
My girls ain't the same, guess it's cuz the fame
Bitches smile in my face and throw dirt on my name
Mad cuz I made it, now friends intimidated
Hate it that I'm in the same game as them
With mo' fame than them, they know who they are
This life is no joke, got us havin' to broke
You was my sister, we used to dream together
How we could make it real big, do our thing together
Huh, Thelma & Louise together, remember them days?
Them niggas we played? Now we don't even speak
Went our seperate ways, seperate lives
Lost friendship for pride, playin' the game
About to forfeit 
high price life, I can't afford it

My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

Daddy's girl, in his wildest dreams
Said he think that lil' Ing will be illest in this rap-thing
Age 4 in my mother's shoes, swore I could sing
And even as a little girl I was doin' my thing
Uh, confused, I ain't asked to be born
Nigga so dumb, shoulda used a condom
Ask mommy every day, when daddy gon' come?
But he never showed up
I would pimp for them, became demented, then men?
Resented them, just the scent of 'em made me hurl
'Specially the baller ones tryin' to buy me with pearls
All I needed was love, all I wanted was love
Lack of love had me fallin' for thugs
The niggas who ain't care, just like Daddy
If he ain't care, why should they?
For this 'high price' life, it's the price I pay

My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go?

All my girls cross the world that feel what I feel
Hearts bruised, then been way I been, keep it movin'
Let him do his thing, I'm the one he's lovin'
I'm here to show ya'll, havin' a kid ain't meanin' nuthin'
That ain't keepin' him, 'specially if he in love with another chick
Then you stuck with the 'babymother-shit'
Don't be lovin' niggas more than yaself
Let 'em roam, a dog always finds his way home
Shit, ya'll don't wanna take my place, catchin' cases
Spit in faces I never seen falsely accused
While some say it's rude
But if I was a dude, they all be amused
But I'm a woman, so I'm a bitch, simple as that
Double-standards, call him a Mack, call me a ho
Say I'm in it for the dough, but tell me
What the fuck he in it for?
Wanted it all, now it's all mine
Loneliness, sorrow, confusion and pain
Nightmares, headlines, ""Rapper found slain""
If it wasn't for my moms I'd drown in this pain
Now ya'll see what it's like, ya'll don't wanna be me
Cuz it ain't always what it seem on TV
Shit, but this is my '9 to 5' ya'll
Sometimes I wanna slit my wrist and end my life ya'll

My life, do ya feel what I feel?
My life, a black girl's ordeal my life
Do ya see what I see?
Have you been where I've been?
Can you go where I go? My life
Do ya'll know what it feels like?
Do ya'll know what it be like?
Do ya see what I see?

Candy,Broken Silence,2001.0,"I taste just like candy
Candy
I taste just like candy
So dance with me

Yo, now let me paint y'all a picture
Fox pimp hard, just quiet like a whisper - don't get it mixed up
Bad little sista; not bad meaning bad but
Bad meaning good - Damn, I'm so hood
You should see me in them jeans
It's hard to describe and
Being cocky is just a part of the vibe
I might stop and holla and pop my collar
Maybe a little conceited but that's always needed
Love attention when I'm passin' by
See I show a little cleavage then I catch his eye
Just the thought of him eatin', I was outside soakin'
Duke standin' loc'in, mouth wide open
I walked over, lickin' my lips
And adjustin' my {tits} and switchin' my hips
He threw his hand on my waist
Looked in my face and said he wanna know how I taste

I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me

Now just imagine me nude, stretched out
I'll be all over the news if this gets out
So hot that the press might ban me
Now how bad you wanna know if I'm sweeter then candy?
What would you risk? Would you put up the car?
Taste my na na in the rain on the hood of your car
Or the back of the plane, {nipples} all out
Bent over the sink with my panties in your mouth
When my dark skin complexion steps in
Won't take no questions to get him and the
Thought of Fox give him an erection
To get real stiff at the sight of my {tits}
Now we can role play, you be the pilot
I'll be the stewardess boy I ain't knew to this
When I lay on my stomach and throw my legs back
Y'all probably won't know how to act

I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me

I'm real sweet like a candy corn
I'm in your thoughts late night when your boys are gone
Picture me, t-shirt, no panties on
Or maybe topless, homie I'm priceless bwoy
The kind of girl that love to talk {shit}
'Specially when I'm on top - the whole show stop
Even though I'm sweet, ain't nuttin sweet
Let me know when you're ready to eat

I taste just like candy, so dance with me
I taste just like candy, so dance with me

4-5-6,Chyna Doll,1999,"Ugh, ughh, yeah
This is Beanie Sigel
That Philly cat who ain't with that silly rap
Put your weight up, not your hate up, niggas
Y'all know how I play quiet towns and tie 'em down
Haters wonderin' how I got a position with Roc
Cuz I listen to The LOX and I listen then watch
While you still sittin' in spots, ditchin' the cops
I'm in the Porsche Box with Fox, glistenin' watch
War steel gray, Lexus, GS-4
Desert Eagle metal in the door, pedal to the floor
I'm routin' down South, for my aim is to score
Eight cylinder, screamin' 'Fuck the law!'
Got a tank full of gas, trunk full of cash
Hammers in the stash, scanners in the dash
Radar detectors, troopers can't find us
We bubble down ATL and hit the 'Linas
Then get clubbed with some Dirty South thugs
Go all out thugs, go in your house thugs
Talk shit, put blood in your mouth thugs
36 South stuck, stay on route thugs
You know how Mac play, quiet town, tie it down
I supply it now, by the pound
Might front you a Q if you buy a pound
If you didn't try it then, why would you try it now?
Think cause Mac rap, I wouldn't fire a round into your crown
I lay you down and retire you clown
And I clap niggas, nap niggas in the dirt
Pat-pat with the deuce deuce, it'll work
Bitch ass niggas wearin' thongs and skirts
Catch 'em early in the mornin' while they goin' to work
See you pretty motherfuckers stay stuck in the mirror
And you weak ass niggas only bust out of fear
I know y'all softer than them feathers that they stuff in a bear
I pack two barettas, never bust in the air
Twist your shit back, spit til my gat sits back
Pack four pieces like a Kit Kat. Heh, get that?
Cop Cris' by the six-pack, Range Rov?' Dot six that
Benz Coupe, drop six that
Buggy eye seven come out? Shit, took the six back
Switch the Double R, the Double R's are, gotta get that
You see how we play, pop Cris' on the E-Way
Soakin' the seat, gettin' drunk with Bleek
Or the Shark Bar, grilled salmon, poppin' Dom P
While you chicken when you chasin' your high with hot tea
Niggas flashin' back money like it's they money
Slap 500 on back of a three-twenty
I'm bringin' it to any nigga tryin' to shoot games (yeah)
With them bullshit buggy-eyed kits and CDs

Check it out, yo, yo
Well, I'm a lil' nigga don't speak, I tote heat
Here to shut down your whole operation on the street
Bleek, you know niggas just had to recruit this
My flow drool out like a old nigga toothless
Who would believe they pump Bleek with Ritalin
Too hyped up, but weed calm my adrenaline
Broke day on the strip, SK in the crib
Hundred crack viles, playin' the bench
Nickel nine gleam, like it's Armor All'd up
My squad be armed up, gotcha niggas' arms up
Who the fuck want what? Me and Bean's trumped up
Witcha town under siege, Dillinger in the sleeve
If my gun jam, you niggas'll squeeze on me
You niggas them cats, that'll call D's on me
I'm on on my off game, need a stadium for in stores
Floss chains and I pimp whores, stay smoked out
Shirt be poked out with the snub-nosed eight
Six to jump out, you eat what you spit
Motherfucker die clean
For you actin' tough cats, but in your heart you serene
I read your body languo
You off balance and don't wanna mangle
You want a challenge, get it brought to from every angle
This shit'll slow 'em down, I bet that
Your up front dough and your six, bet that motherfucker

Sassy Fox some brick money, cop me a drop
You know how I run it, 600, glassy top
Rock the light gray wrist shit, flash them rocks
The red, the yellow, the green, causin' traffic stops
Bitch please, never freeze, gonna blast the Glock
Then I show a little cleave' and breeze past the cops
You talk slick but suck dick for money in y'all hand
I'm like, ""Bitch, I got more money than your man""
While you get your knees scraped up, cum all on your glands
Shit, I'm in the V-Twiz ballin' on you tramps
Y'all hoes greasy, so I keep the bitch easy
Rookie, fuck you know about Glocks and pock' books?
You know Na Na rock that shit, Pra-da that shit
Es-ca that shit, Dolce Gabba that shit
Hollow points, top that shit, fuck you tryin' to aim
Pop that shit, yeah, nigga, Fox got that shit
You see the ice wrist shit, can you cop that shit
Chenille, crocodile and ostrich shit, whoa!
You know my style, I be spendin' they cash
And I'll show their little dick some celebrity ass
And get 'em a brick, I know what style to get them niggas shit real
Well, fuck, I let 'em live and lick the tip of my shit
To remind 'em of some rose petals, candles, and shit
Or some hydro like the nigga grew a plant in my shit
So that's what it is, that's why them hoes mad at my shit
See my whilin' in the four-six, stylin' on they bum ass
Goddess MC, y'all bitches is little Foxes
I see my girls frontin', tossin' they little watches
Cris? I pops it. Fuckin' a nigga topless
Cats? I fouls on. Hoes? I styles on, nigga
Wear y'all out then air y'all out
Over here? Hustle from where, clear all out
Shit, greyhound bitch, stay down bitch
And y'all know Jigga sent me here to lay down shit
I will spray y'all niggas, will waste y'all niggas
Cause I fucked the nigga and paid y'all niggas

Sip mo', threw up at, flip coke, blew up that
Where them fake thugs got they vest-es chewed up at
Brooklynnn beef! Who want that?

I grew up in the thoroughist bourough - B.K
Where B.I.G. had everybody rockin D.K
Gav was the first dude with the CLK
And bricks was gettin shipped outta East L.A
It's Brooklyn, where niggas lives was tooken
Rich cats got knocked and they wallets was tooken
Fort Greene and Hemlock, the fifth been cocked
We cried when they killed Lenox and popped them rocks
(Aiyyo, ya ain't hear, what {​​the fuck}​​ I just said?)
B.K. - the home of Biggie and Jay
Where niggas got Will Smith chips, get jiggy all day
Bitches that boost in the city all day
Heckel and Koch, crack spots, federal watch
I grew up here, sip Mo', threw up here
Yo the feds snatched two up here, in B.K

Gorillas got rich from stairwells and P.A

Brooklyn! The livest borough
You come here frontin you might die in this borough
The East, the 'Ville and Bed-Stuy's in this borough
It's full of projects, the wildest borough
Try to figure out which side is thorough
From, C.I. to Saint Marks is carryin cons
Niggas rock Coogi and Dolce Gaban's
So women here make a livin just carryin bombs
We pop, corks a little bit and we floss a little bit

Nah don't hop out, slide out lookin' like a knockout
Show a little thigh, make this nigga's eyes pop out
Sieze him with the cleavage
I want you to make this nigga believe he 'bout eat it

I'm the lady with a 380 special right next to you
Glock poppin' out the stock
And it's two guns, two hun', get down
I tear this whole shit down
They ain't know the vault, pull bank jobs
I banged ya squaw when I aims this rod
Y'all niggas can't do a thing to this broad
My bullets hurt the same as y'alls
I've been taught by the best, extorted the rest
Wearin' a niggas shit, crossin' my chest
Life on the line, say prayers under my breath
But knew I'd be 'aight cuz right there to my left (right)
Hova baby, told you baby
Big gun right over your left shoulder baby
Same nigga that taught you how to hold that 80
From day one 'til we old and crazy
Let's kill the world

Now would you die for your nigga?
Yeah I'd die for my nigga
Would you ride for your nigga?
I gets lie for my nigga
Would you live for your nigga?

Time check ma, we got about 5 minutes
Before the authorities rush and the FBI's in it
That teller's up to something, look, his eyes are squinted
Don't let that button be the reason why you're finished
Yeah, the sky's the limit 'til we reach B.I.G
Meet Jesus, confess to him all the shit we did
Gotta reverse the six, let's murd' head jerk
Almost got whiplash
We got a shitload of cash
Throws it in the stash

My mind is the drama that got me lookin' back constant
Some Don shit, Foxy, get ready to bomb shit
Blink a eye, missed the comment
The calmest, it's not a threat, it's the promise

Who be the mahogany mami, the slanted eyes
Hold it down, Boogie Fox, you bitch niggas strip
You web niggas dead on, get fucked and wet on
Shitted on, I want a low, fuckin' wit Don like Ronald
Thirty inch, fortistrano, mill-ion, sophisticado, ill movado
The Firm's baby girl, my fam be my whole world
It figures 'cause she'd die for them niggas
Doe or die status, ma-ma be the baddest
From Brook-lyn to Queensbrige it's pure Havoc
Havoc, we on a job, fuckin' wit Mobb
They had the drop on 'em
The slanted eyes peep the rocks on 'em
He kinda jig and he bubblin' big
Dig a hole holdin' so's watch his cash start foldin'
And bet though, twenty G craps wet though
Nas you shoulda seen the nigga jet though
Had it on blast, shoulda seen me shakin' all of my ass
Of course me, I threw the gas, thug nigga turnin' real saucy
Firm lay low I'mma play if you say so
So stay close like I'm bout to twist babe bro
I laid it down, went a couple of rounds and tried to flaunt him
I threw it on him, now he's right where I want him

Got my mind in crooked ways, saturated up in Alize
You ain't a threat nigga
So get big nigga baby girl crossin' over send your soldiers
Toucha fuck a Russia, this world is colder
Like a day in December 25th, son I got gift
From monkey, motherfuckers, that wanna rip
Get your shit split, pushed back, grill that ass don't look back
Respect this, like a Lexus repo man I took that
Five cats to death dog, like shop I'm gonna set more
Handwritten obituaries vocal through my chords
Lights out, just pull the nines out
Let's find out, pointin shook ones, they pointin dimes out
It ain't hard, straight up and down, you get your deck pulled
My hand is full, of fake niggas I position
Expensive intuition fuck a rap competition
Gat expo, get a grip and never let go
The tet blows, the rapper Noyd said, ""That ass is wet though""
Triple P, paranoid plus petrol
Scared to death, put the pedal to the metal
Ghetto connections, Audi 4, take your section
You only get once chance, ain't no second guessin
We blessin, peepin your style, them never testin
Lessons of life walk the night witcha weapon

Locked up, the thug nigga took a L nigga bitched up
The snake niggas slither like Jake, ain't all great
Ain't no threat, done fuckin' with them niggas that's fake
They got though, pushin' a 850 auto
They sayin' nada, they know The Firm gettin' nachoes
Cheddar like whatever, I see money frontin' in the land
I got him, I got me a fuck and his man
Murderous mami, I threw the kiss, he was hist'
Oooh, shoulda seen that ill Roley on his wrist
It seem like he fuckin' wit cream, somethin' mean
You'll be straight with his eight and dead him on all his heron
Realistically, papi, is history, mami
I got this, chill Pa Pa, let me rock this
I'm fuckin' wit fours to cock this, let me plot this
Ice he nuttin' nice, if he front, take his life
At the Shark Bar, fuckin wit Duke, him and his mans
Really frontin boo, got him the red velour Filas too
Here come my niggas now in the black Hummer stuntin
Yeah that's The Firm, jig the fuck up and body sumpin
Whattup now Duke, his eyes cried from the inside
I seen all of his fears cause he about to fry
He looked at me, through his right eye, was like
""Mami why?"" I felt fucked up, I can't lie
He was shook, 'Mega opened his chest, ain't nuttin left

Last breath

'Fore they knew who Foxy was, you probably was
The first to keep it real wit all my secrets concealed
Things got ill the minute I got a deal
And my time got shorter and you was havin a daughter
Had to stop hopscotch, get off Iran
Damn I wish we were still playin jump

If I could take this back I would
If I could rewind the time to when it was all good
I would, take it back to when we said good-bye

Thought he'd never get caught tryin to play on whores

From the trunk, to the hood, by the wheel and the floor
Exposed my vulnerable side, had me open wide
Said you forever keep it real, but you lied
Was the first to feel inside, the Ill Na Na
Had me thirst when you whispered to me, ""How it feel mama?""
Yeah, but don't hurt it, I like the way you work it
No Diggity, don't stop get busy
Blew up your pager, checked your clothes
Duked your house keys, stole your beeper code
What happened to the Mo's and the occasional roses
Massages and the bubble baths, rubbin my toes as
I realize you was just misleadin me
I shoulda known, you left your last chick to be with me


Mommy dearest tried to prepare us for a lot ahead
You never heard, preferred to smoke your lye instead
On the one to one combo told me you'd die for bread
That's why I spend these nights, cryin in the bed
You had the deep dish six, your rep was widespread
I tried to intervene you said it was over my head
Said I'd never understand the plight of a black man
Right, but I'm tryin to keep you in my life
V.I.A. satellite, talkin them burn outs
Soon you had me whylin and you turned me out
Taught me bout how to win, the code of the streets
Luxuries and wealth untold it was sweet
And one night you asleep after work was chopped up
Felt somethin strange in my veins, I popped up
One foot in the house shoot flew to the horn
Got the cell operator, I knew you was gone",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-if-i-lyrics

Puttin it down.. whoa-oh-oh-oh.. c'mon

But the saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was feeling the pain - the pain, the pain
The saddest day of my life
Was when she left me with a broken heart
I was going insane - yeahh-yeahh

Now I'm the type of bitch that's one of a kind
Y'all know, the kind of bitch that like to sip that fine wine
Like to be on top or, get it from behind
Either way I throw the pussy like the free throw line
Break a nigga spine, tote a calico and dare
Any bitch fi come try test mine
Violate, one time, I cock the nine
You, motherfuckin right I bust a bitch over mine
Shit, niggas can cheat and put tips in bitches' waist
But when we slip up, get a gun in our face
Have me missin show dates, heart beatin slow pace
Wonder what he doin, who the fuck he screwin
Bitches ain't shit; know that that's your man
And they still fuck around and try to suck the nigga dick
And I'm a bad bitch, I don't play that bullshit
Bitch'll catch wreck, I ain't got a full deck nigga


Ever since I was a little girl, always wanted to know
How the fuck these niggas think, why de man a move so
Why would you jeapordize your whole life
Fuckin one bitch for one night; blame it on the liquor
How would you feel if I fucked another nigga
And told you that that motherfucker made me cum quicker?
You'd probably grab the gat and put two in my back
One in my face, nigga but it's one in my waist
Go 'head and slip, watch me shut down this bitch
Cheat on who? Nigga I'll be gone before you
And when you with the one you love, disrespect the game
'fore he drive you insane, losin your fuckin brain

Foxy Brown.. Wayne Wonder..
Puttin it down.. whoa-oh-oh-oh.. c'mon


For months I used to cry, felt like I wanted to die
Kept asking God why, do I deserve this?
We all make mistakes, ain't nobody perfect
We're human, and through it all, I remained a good woman to you
Prayin for strength and losin my faith
How could you lay in our bed and lie in my face?
Jumpin out my sleep
Havin nightmares of me tossin and turnin, my heart still burnin
Watchin me suffer, relivin my fears
Holdin my pillow close while you dryin my tears
Stop your blood claat cryin, need to stop lyin
And look me in my eyes 'fore these plates start flyin
And how the fuck could you disrespect us
Everything we stand for, all our love and our trust
Seems like I said before, you won't appreciate me
And everything we have 'til I'm out the fuckin door


Try to erase, all the memories
They're the ones they gon' see
If I could forget, all about the past
Oh no no no - how long will this go onnnn?

Down in D.C., Touch Me, Tease Me baby
C'mon, you know the tracks I get dumb on
Can't front on me, playa haters we stunt on
I regulate, Dan-non, down to Ra-mon
I swung on hits y'all couldn't get run on
Brown baby uhh, I been chromed out
This ain't nuttin new parked Benz on out
And I flows like, CK One
Somethin in they hoes like, she fakes none, aight
I'm the quintessential, mistress of the instrumental
Y'all could Wait to Exhale
, I'mma vent a little
Set It Off like Jada,
 robbin the bank
I got this money thing covered, from the dollar to the franc
The pounds to the pence, it's like hustlin backwards
Nuttin y'all said made a ounce of sense
My moves be calculated, documented
No matter what you sell, I got you in a minute
Take a look at your charts, watch me climb
Turn it upside down, six digits to nine
Inside out got reversable rhymes
We could go pop widdit or run the block widdit
Never before done til The Firm did it
If it ain't for the paper then nah we not with it
Got to stay driven so we can stay drivin
Boom to my whole crew, gotta pull a diamond
See me lookin hot in the crop Tercel
Gettin richer, you wish you ran game this well
Rock the bells

Uhh, is it raw
Uhh, uh-huh, to the core, uhh
I'mma give it to ya raw, give your more, uhh
Uh-huh, like that, yeah, c'mon, rock the bells

Broken Silence,Broken Silence,2001,"The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When the wicked came against me to eat up my flesh
My enemies and foes, they stumbled and fell
Though an army may encamp against me
My heart shall not fear
Though war may rise against me
In this I will be confident

I will survive

Take, these broken wings (these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (you taught me how to fly, fly)
When we hear, the voices sing
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Feel like I've got this black cloud hangin' over me
It's like this pain is takin' control of me
Every move I make, determines my fate
Feel like I'm dying slow, and that's the shit I hate
The constant pressure, the bullshit rumors
The outcast, I'm the one they love to badge
When the records stop sellin'
And the crowds stop yellin'
All I have is me
Bet you thought I'd die without you
But see how I'm still living
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here, with another one
Even though I felt crumbled, I made it through the rumble
Torn apart, a young woman scorned
Coping with the pain, nearly drove me insane
In the hospital, crying in the pain
All types of medications, flowing through my veins

Take, these broken wings (these, broken, wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free
When we hear, the voices sing (I will learn, I will learn, how to fly)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Please, understand I'm a human first
And before Foxy Brown, I'm just still Inga
And my family, is my whole life
And I cherish this ring that you put on my finger
We survived through the roughest stones
Sleeping with our baby pit bull on the basement floors
And through it all, you and I felt we could be strong
All through the rough times, through the pains and storms
And, it's like when it rains, it pours
All they see is gray and blue, they don't know you like I do
Five years committed, y'all just don't understand
No career, no fame, meant more than my man
And, to my fans that slept through it all
Through the rise and the fall, I love y'all all
Even when I nearly lost my mind
Some remained loyal, ignored the headlines and

Take, these broken wings (take, these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (let em fly, let em fly)
When we hear, the voices sing (voices sing)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Story of my legacy, this can't be life
Lord, I feel like I'm fallin'
Praying for strength, I'm losing my mind
And, how can you fly when your wings are broken?
And, how can I smile when my heart is broken?
Through all the pain I've felt, that's the hand I'm dealt
My personal problem, stays in my home
Know I won't discuss them, reporters I don't trust 'em

Take, these broken wings (these broken wings)
And let them fly again
And let them live so free (I wanna see them fly)
When we hear, the voices sing
The book of love will open up, and let us in
Take, these broken wings (take these broken wings)
And let them fly again (oohh)
And let them live so free (let them live so free, so free)
When we hear, the voices sing (yeahh)
The book of love will open up, and let us in

Teach me how to fly
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh)
Teach me how to fly
I believe, in the power, of love
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Can't you hear me, don't you hear me?
(ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh-ooh)
I'm calling out to you
Foxy help me sing

When that happens, you're gonna go to jail like the rest of 'em
It'll happen someday, believe me
Your life as you know is over""

Aiyo, guns and roses, sons and soldiers
Drug game, cocaine, Ac's and Range Rovers
Snakes plan up ways to set they own man up
For grams when they bag up Cristal White
At night pistols might lift you like heat-seekin' missiles
Streets tempt you, police out to get you
'Cause niggas you ran with got knocked and snitched, too
Your bitch knew time you faced, you didn't hide the safe
Now she's fuckin' in your fly estate

Firm La Familia,
 organized criminals, boy
You just a hand-to-hand soldier, I'm a general
One-way ticket to Hell is what I'm sendin' you
Yo, you idiot rookie cops know my props go high
Like Himalayan mountains
'Mega bouncin' in the Z-3, countin' up G's with no doubt, dun

I'd die for my niggas
Stick you for pies and lie for my niggas
Plead guilty, get the chair and fry for my niggas
It's essential that we all is A-Alike in mental
We've been through life, cold blood, livin' sinful
Though we learned from old thugs that made it
Peeped how they played it, we rated and evaluated
Calculated the ages we be, the days we see
Chips freely, beyond whips and TV's
Stock bonds, loot flipped the CD's
But niggas hate to see you on top
They'd rather be you, what not
I keep the Desert Eagle pump cocked
Spot the vic' in this guy quick, why pop shit?
My niggas leave you shot quick in a hop skip
Specialize in fly shit

Drippin' Gambinana, behind the liner, three Na-na's
From head to toe, laced up in Gabbana
With Sosa chip, the 4.6 Range Rover to Villanova
From Castilino to Colombo, Foxy Brown, papa
Beyond figures, boo, I'll die for my nigga's Rollie
The Firm controlee, they chop ki's to clock G's
Rock crocky's and drop three's and cop 3's

Check my lingo and all the white ice that make my rings glow
I've seen doe, got a dime wife from San Domingo
Face it, it's mathematics basics, far from fake shit
My mind is sacred, my skin shines like a Cuban bracelet
Egyptian Pharaoh, potent ganja used to get me paro
Now I inhale from gunshots through my double barrel
Beneath the ground is how the sounds travel, so what have you?
Keep in mind: Feds won't stop until they grab you
Used to bust guns, now it's just stocks and trust funds
G's and CDs so my seed can soon touch some
The foulness I once provoked is now behind me
It's gonna take more than sellin' coke now to bind me
It had me thinkin', ""I gotta kill to keep from sinkin'""
That con way of life that keep live niggas from Lincoln
I saw it comin', that's why I slowed down from dumbin'

The Letter,Broken Silence,2001.0,"This is a letter from Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby

Dear Mommy, I apologize
I know it's because of me that your life is traumatized
And it's 'cause of me that at times you wanna die
But you was always there when your little Na Na cried
And when the media said Foxy's ill
You was there when this fame almost got me killed
When I was in the hospital, could not be still
Only you knew the reasons why I popped these pills
And to my friends, I love them and I know they care
But, time after time, you was always there
When I did the Vibe cover holdin' my crotch
I was wailin' while you prayed for me hopin' I'll stop
Sorry for the times I didn't tell the truth
And I'm sorry for the times that I yelled at you
I love you mommy, I'm sorry that's happened
Please pass the letter to Gavin

This is a letter

 from Inga
To my mother, and my brothers, and my baby

Ah yea, oh, oh, oh, yea

(Up in the studio gettin' low)
So many memories 
(memories)

Gavin, damn, where do I start?
You knew it all, you was there from the start
My cold deed the ear to my heart
Just writing this tears me apart, see
Seemed like yesterday when I signed my deal
Bought the Benz, and put you behind the wheel
I wanted you to know that I did it for us
And I wanted you to know I was committed to us
And of course the along way, we had our disputes
You didn't care for some of the things that I would do
But you still watched my back, complete and the same
You're the one that used to school me, and teach me the game, see
Whether I'm here, or dead in a box
Keep my name alive, you know no bitch is better than Fox
I love you, tell ma I'll never forget her
Let Ant read the rest of the letter

This is a letter to my mother

And my brothers, and my baby

Oh 
(listening)
(It's the realest shit I ever wrote)
Come on home
Oh 
(memories)
 I love you

Anton, don't let this letter get you down
Damn, I hope I didn't let you down
I made my mistakes, I was young in the mind
But you gotta admit, I was one of a kind
Remember Miami when you fought my man
Can't imagine how mentally lost I am
Never knew life could be so painful
Tell daddy I love him, and I'm still his little angel
I'm all cried out, I feel like I wanna go
Can't take this no more
I want my life like it was before, my life so raw
Love you Ant but I can't write no more

Ohhh come on come back home
Memories, Memories..
Ohh I'm so sorry
I want my lover
Yeaaa this is my letter
To my mother
And my brothers
And my baby
My my my baby
Please, listen
Listen to me
Oh somebody listen
Listen to me
Come on home

Oh I love my mother
And my brother
But what about my baby
Oh my baby

It’s Hard Being Wifee,Chyna Doll,1999,"Ugh, ladies, y'know how that sayin' goes
Be careful what you ask for in life
Cause you just might get it
Dependin' on what you ask for, what you get?
You might not be able to get out of
You heard? Ugh

Niggas might take advantage if you let 'em
Play your cards right, and if you fuck 'em in the same night
Make sure that he don't snitch
Must be up to sumpin'  or be lyin' on his dick
Shit, you know how niggas flick from gettin' pussy to head
'Til you spent yo' brant and blew his dick
Especially if he trick, shit
Don't complain bitch, do yo' thang and cop that ring
When he hit you with that game, you be like
""'Ight, dude, whatever"" and sleep on it
Put like a week on it, get the Benz Jeep and creep on it
Do you like yeah, faggot, screw you
Fuck am I to do now? Just lay back like I'm that lame bitch
Dude, I'm that same bitch, don't you know?  Never cross no ho
Especially if she was Wifee and she know where the stash go
Fuck you wildin' fo'?  Who you stylin' fo'?
And the truth is he fuckin' with the deuce kid
He don't know that I stick and move
Get him right for that Chyna White
Nothing to lose, and I see right through him
Yeah, we fuckin' tonight
And the Duke ain't what he talkin' then I'm truckin' tonight
And if he sweet with the big ones, I'm lucky tonight
And if he packin' like he yappin', I'm doin' him right

Yo, when your man ain't fuckin' you right
And the dope that he singing
In the hood ain't that Chyna White
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't right
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't tight
Yo, when your man ain't fuckin' you right
And the dope that he singing
In the hood ain't that Chyna White
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't right
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't tight

Ughh, mostly, they'll play you closely
Especially if you fuckin' 'em, and he think you trustin' him
Damn bitch, you lovin' 'em, impressed like that
Bomb head, e'ry night, is the sex like that?
Yeah, you ain't know, I would stress like that
Over due, not his ones, he don't handle like that
Shoulda known not to fuck wit no light weight cats
Rollin' doves in his stacks, I ain't fuckin' wit that
I'm like 'Dude, where the fuck is yo' big heads at?'
And you know how I get down, I don't pumps like that
Plus he act funny, and he only fuck with track money
And I'm, seven zero platinum plack money, it's not a game, nigga
And like Sparkle, Be Careful What You Say, nigga
The kind of cat that make you wonder if he was sent to do this
Put it down for you, first chick he ever cried fo'
Never had a chick that raps like this
Ain't impressed for no C cuz we straight like this
And he makes it very clear baby mothers don't exist
They just some Fox haters and condom breakers, ya heard?

Yo, when your man ain't fuckin' you right
And the dope that he singing
In the hood ain't that Chyna White
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't right

We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't right
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't tight

Ugh, the situation is
Y'all chicks be fuckin' with that mistress shit
Bad broke, if it's not for the dough, I splits with the quickness
Pleads no fifths, leaves no traces, ya heard?
What the fuck is this?  Payback shit?
Is it God striking me for some way back shit?
I'm like, damn, was the bitch really foul like this?
And my loc'n just to think I should slash my wrist
Am I seven for me thinkin' I should total my six
Or just straight spazz out, fuck his man and split
Take the code to the safe and just empty his bricks
On the low, but I know that he love when I flip
Ya'll bet the note, had him throw the smash game
Shit, I got the ring bitch and his last name
Any bitch could do a nigga whole bit
Any bitch could luck up and have a kid
Any chick could fuck a nigga for spite
But the nigga got to love you if he make you his wife
Ughh, ya'll chicks is lonely, I'm ownin' that dick
And on top of all this bullshit, I'm still his chick

Yo, when your man ain't fuckin' you right
And the dope that he singing
In the hood ain't that Chyna White
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't right
We say fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Cause he just ain't tight
Yo, when your man ain't fuckin' you right

Fallin’,Broken Silence,2001.0,"Through this hard times, the negativity, the jealousy

Yo Carolina Blue six - hottest bitch on the block
Used to wheelie Ducatti, Saco, Prada kick
High school, got signed wrote them platti hits
Tito was the same shit, got a platti wrist
They say I'm stoosh cause I cover my bush
In that Dolce Gabbana, I'm a hot little mama
The number one stunna
Slim, skin copper
Like bare bra, I'd eat that gravy proper
Got a money fetish
Wanna see me where your bed is?
Playboy y'all got to give me five letters
Like Prada, Jacob, Fendi boots
C. Dior, Chloe, suits
Range Rover, Gucci shoes
First class, flatt class, Paris

Don't hate me cause I'm ballin'
Lord take me if I'm fallin'
I think I hear them callin' me
Why they keep on callin' me?
Don't hate me cause I'm ballin'
Lord take me if I'm fallin'
I think I hear them callin' me
Why the keep on callin' me?

If I was to die, it be too many cowards alive
Fox Brown, Bonnie minus the Clyde
And today I'mma make this one promise to God
Even if I go wood, I'mma keep it so hood
And I got chills when I signed my deal
And I shed tears when Biggie and Pac got killed
It's only one other broad that really got skills
She's alright, but she's not real
Brown, I'm hot with no rehearsal time
And I stays on tour like the circle line
Ain't a bitch that could emulate my classic delivery
I rep' New York like the Statue of Liberty
Mentally I'm in my own zone holding my spot
Fox, basically I'm the female Pac
And it's like my life is a thesis
Sometimes I feel like I'm talking Swedish
Y'all niggas don't get it
And, yeah I'm ballin', the streets keep callin'
Lord take my soul I feel like I'm falling

Don't hate me cause I'm ballin'
Lord take me if I'm fallin'
I think I hear them callin' me
Why the keep on callin' me?
Don't hate me cause I'm ballin'
Lord take me if I'm fallin'
I think I hear them callin' me
Why the keep on callin' me?

Before me there was many but none so hot
They had no other choice but to run they spot
Rock since 15 I was bound to ball
Think it's time to run my resume down to y'all
See, Touch Me...platinum
Ain't No...gold
Total...500,000 sold
Ill Nana...2.8
The Firm...another mil
Then Chyna Doll came, it's pretty much the same
And anything we rap about you see us do
Now we stay in demand like PS2
Lot of planes, lot of cars, a lot of chauffeurs
Lot of Gucci, lot of Louis, lot of Prada loafers
Couple dollars and with that I bought my Range
Pretty and Red got a lot of ass off my name, man
Yeah I'm balling the streets keep calling

Ugh, yeah, yeah, yeah, heh
Ugh, get sticky wit' it
Ugh, get your name back
Not that, ugh

Nigga wanna lay up on my couch, watchin' cable
Hands all in his pants, feet all on my table
Niggas I don't know, rollin' 'dro
Optimo', blow you got to go nigga, out the door
Tryin' to throw some hints
It's the first of the month, time to pay some rent
You could send them niggas home and hit the streets
Cuz you been layin' up chillin' in this bitch for weeks
Know that ice is nice and sticks is sleek
And the fridge is full, but the shit ain't sweet
Nigga get cause to floss, keep shit that's new
Sure, you could charge it but the bill is due
See ballers like you gotta pay to play
Y'all Big Pun niggas gotta pay like you weigh
You could come by, shit, but you can't stay
Let my girl Mya sing what I came to say, c'mon

Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me
Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me

I need a heavy trick with a deadly dick
With a Benz two-thousand SE 6, 's watch, whatever
As long as the Bezzy sit at least three
TV's in everywhere
I ain't tryin' to go to court for child support
In a crib cramped up, fighting for Pampers
I don't want dram's wit' ya'll baby moms
Nigga, all I want is Cartier Charms
Been tryin' to take it there, fuck the movies
I'm a red carpet bitch, nigga, world premiere
Shit, I ain't your average I-got-to-have-shit
And I'm a shopaholic, with a heavy shoe habit
Not one two, I need a few karats
Nigga try suffer, buy a stiletto
And I gotta have them Prada bags
And them shopping sprees and alotta cash, c'mon

Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me
Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me

If you wanna fuck, I could spend
If you wanna front, gotta go
If you got dough, let 'em in
If you go broke, it ain't the end
Remember how you did it before?
Let's do it again
You could start from the bottom
Take it to the top
Start it from the Hoopty, end it in the Drop
Wanna know the secret how you stay on me?
You gotta get on, stay on your J.O.B., c'mon

Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B
If you wanna be with me
Cause ain't nothing going on but the rent
You got to have a J.O.B

My Life (Cradle 2 the Grave),Cradle 2 The Grave,UnKnown,"From the cradle until now, still Fox, just a little more mature
Seen it with my bare eyes, did it all before, been through hell on earth
Playing out my role I was given since birth, recepting it well
Go hard at them critics, they expect me to fail, work hard for my fans
They expect me to sell, they suspect I'm living well
But they don't know the pain I feel, five minutes away from getting killed
It's ill, my moms' always hug me when I'm leaving
I wake up crying because death bugs me when I'm sleeping
Jam Master died, it's like I ain't done grieving
Big and Pac gone, and look, we still beefing
And son, even, we at odds in these days
Where niggers' die over cars and their chains
I thank God that I'm saved and I'm a hold it down in this game
Now, from the cradle to the grave

From the cradle to the grave, I wish I knew my life
Would end up being this way, from the cradle to the grave
I wish I knew my life would end up being this way

From the cradle until now, I been through it all, y'all
Y'all don't know half the things, I been through it, dog
Pain and suffering, I been through it all, my heart's still cold
I been through the storm, confused all these years
Shit, we grew all these years, I remember me and you on the stairs
Talking about what we're going to do when we're big
Money came into play and best friends went they way, shit
I wish it never had to go that way
The price of fame can cost a whole friendship
Yeah we got dollars, but it's senseless
So I pray to God for forgiveness, and ask him to carry me through
All the stress, and the drama in this business, I bare witness
I Fox, and keep going strong until my heart stop
And keep flowing strong with a -, come on

From the cradle to the grave, I wish I knew my life
Would end up being this way, from the cradle to the grave
I wish I knew my life would end up being this way

As a little girl, I wish I knew that I would be going through the drama That's in my life, all the suffering, everywhere I've been
How I get myself in all this bullshit I'm in

From now until the grave, I look back at my life, smile, and say 'wow'
In amazement, all these roadblocks, wonder how did I make it
Wonder how I became famous, I'm impressed with me
It's like rumours been obsessed with me, but the truth's never told
It was left with me, and what's left for me is to extend my hand
If they don't reach then I'll let them be, I've got to live my life right
But I wouldn't change how I lived my like
If I could live my life twice, y'all don't understand what Inga's life's like
A black stressed, I turned my back to the world, and now I'm back to the world
This black girl's blessed, yeah, my fans helped me through it
I was destined to blaze from the cradle to the grave
Thank God my family helped me through it

From the cradle to the grave, I wish I knew my life
Would end up being this way, from the cradle to the grave
I wish I knew my life would end up being this way",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-my-life-cradle-2-the-grave-lyrics

From the most lethal conglomerate on wax
Foxy Brown, AZ, Nas Escobar, and now introducing
Cormega the Executive

This how it went down
Had to undergo therapy, now surgery
A nigga wetted me but, he didn't murder me Dunn

Once was friends, but that shit's dead
That stupid motherfucker shoulda shot me in the head

They threw this cream, my whole team must fiend
The ghetto dream, Fox Boog, jigged up
Stay in the cut like what, layin' in the Bentleys
Stoned, flossed on, me and Capone
Picasso, Mardi Gras, play the low in a six-double-oh
Benz chrome, dominicano
Superstar Lila Escobar holy matrimon'
Tied to The Firm, die for The Firm
So help me God, street life played right
I got his wife, hemmed up, in bun
Nigga two to the gut

Nowhere to rest nigga, nowhere to hide
It's a high speed chase and death is on my mind
Will I fall or fail who call the shots it's all real
Firm, get on your job, niggas, what the deal
(repeat 2X)

Mahogany Brown laid it down, shoulda seen her
Threw the heater, to the grill, it was real
Pure steel, my niggas peel murderin, gunnin through Queens
In Beams, forty-four chrome, Mac-11 stow it in they jeans
Pretty thugs, Firm team
Hold it down, we hold the crown
Got it locked rock shop, heron caught
Out of town breeze through, he had a Z2 baby blue
No clue, we had this whole life planned
Call the fam lay low, Firm style let it flow

Nowhere to rest nigga, nowhere to hide
It's a high speed chase and death is on my mind
Will I fall or fail? Who call the shots? it's all real
Firm, get on your job, niggas, what the deal (x2)

He was dressed, in a sky blue Guess
Eva wrecks, we played the left, no threat
We had him shook, couldn't look, dripped sweat
He coulda fried, I seen his eyes, yeah nigga
'Mega fly, Doe or Die, fifty eye ay
Cop way Firm stray, high stake Boo
Ill booth how we do, Boogie top gun
Phillipine black thing, you know the stee Dunn
A-filliation, caramel brown
Ill style complexion, you know the deal
How we roll, like a vir-gin, on the low
Yeah Boo get your swerve on, how we do
Crew Boog's got it locked bigga, for the crew
Hold it down niggas fo' peala, fo' killa
Fo'reala, ho squeala, they know the deala
Shit is reala, Firm for real

Eyo, it's the Ill Na Na baby!
Brooklyn, let's get it in

I've been a star since a virgin in highschool
Since the age of fourteen I've been a rap bitch version of 
Mike ???
And I don't know how to trust, the church or the rifle
God or the devil, the burner or the Bible
Got a black cloud on me, I've been cursed by my 
right ones
I'm back bitches! The retun of ya Idol
F-to-the-O-X, B-double-O
Black hand keep them Lambos and them black Impalas
I wreck the style homie, ain't a bitch chilla
I fucks with gangstas baby, like prince Miller
And when they locked Tuquan, I felt the East split up
He and his Feds, but he left his legacy in killa
I keep my killaz on that Brooklyn shit
Fox ripped the world like the Brooklyn Bridge
I'm back now, Brooklyn ain't never looked this big
I hold it down while y'all lookin' for Big
Next blakka Miss

I'm in my own fuckin' world, I speak how I feel
Sometimes I feel like I'm just too fuckin' real
Foxy Brown uh, what the deal is?
They ain' got a clue what we about to do

FB! You know what it is
AZ of course

What up boogz? You know I would if I could
Bring the hood on the V.I., my man from C.I
Said his ball was in the mess hall witchu at jail time
Lookin' like you was right at your crib in Alpine
No signs of a warrior's face
I know you sprayed if your peer wasn't so soft while he helped you escape
But on the real, we never got a chance to build
With all the bullshit somebody shoulda told you to kill
To the steel, so many rappers lost they mind
Like twentyfive to life never forced they mind
Your moms cryin', we spoke, I almost choked
Was there the same day to brought yo ass up in the post
It's getting close, see you soon, sometime in June
Utilize the red goons for yo mind to bloom
A flesh wound always heal, but death that's it
I'ma go now, but let that sit",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-too-real-lyrics

Pros, slam those
Game tied tight like bows, we never close
Three-sixty-five, twenty-four
Hand chose bitches a la mode, gettin' sold
Plus a load of killer, as Chronic gettin' blowed
Keep it froze, tucked up in a Tupperware bowl
Stick of gold, somethin' from the school of the old

Ain’t No Nigga,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I keep it fresher than the next bitch
No need..for you to ever sweat the next bitch
... With speed I make the best bitch see the exit..indeed
You gotta know your thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You gotcha own '96 suh in..the ride
And keep your ass tighter than Versace that's why
You gotta watch your friends you got to watch me
They conniving shit
The first chance to crack the bank
They try me, all they get is 50 cent franks
And papayas, from the village to the tele
Time to kill it on your belly no question
I got more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon, so when I shoot
Met your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my after life..
Laugin' my shit is tight
You who askin' right...

Ain't no nigga like the one I got
No one can fuck you betta
Sleeps around but he gives me a lot
Keeps you in diamonds and leathers
Friends 'ill tell me I should leave you alone
Hah hah, hah hah, hah hah, hah ha
Tell the freaks to find a man of there own
(man a they own, man a they own)

Fresh to def in my skeeno
Coach bag lookin half black and filipino fakin no jacks
Got you a beeper to feel important
Surrounding your feet in Joanie Dega's and Charles Jordan
I keep ya dove but love
You know these ho's be makin' me weak
Why'all knows how it goes 'be and so I creep
I've been sinnin' since you been playin' wit Barbie and Ken in
You can't change a players game in the 9th inning
The chrome rim spinning keeps em grinnin'
So I run way the fuck up in em
And wrinkle the face like linnin'
I play hard-eh till they say God..
He's keepin' it real jigga stay hard
Lawd don't even trip
I never slip, nigga what you don't see is whatcha get
Weapons concealed what the fuck why'all feel
When you nigga play sick we can all get ill
What's the deal-

Yo, ain't no stoppin this, no lie
Promise to stay monogamous, I try
But love you know these ho's be makin me weak
Why'all knows how is goes 'be so I stay deep

What up boo just keep me laced in the illa snakes
Bank rolls and shit, back rubs in the french tubs
Makin' this bitch, wifee nigga
So when you flip that coke
Remember them days you was dead broke
But now your style and I raised you
Basically made you into a don
Flippin' weight..heroin and shit
You know my pussy is all that
That's why I get bagets 5 carats and all that
From doshay?????from H I'm ringing bells
So who the playa, I still keep you in the illest gators
Tailor made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin
On how I fuck the best a shit
Specially when I'm flippin Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push disease, eatin shrimp diamond rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit
When you was in letters and bullshit berattas
And eek classes with mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali wit all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens' up in your benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me
Playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry bout them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spinnin that bitch
I took a little when you was up north
Your comisary stay pilin
How you livin large on the island
All them collects have me vex
But when you come home
Knew I was comin off wit half of dem checks
Now we on the rise
Your diamond mami wit the slanted eyes
Holdin this grip cocked the green and the shit
Folks know I see half the dough

She was arrested and released on a thousand dollar bond but if found
Guilty of the charge, she could face up to sixty days in prison.""

Yeah, you know its been a long time since y'all heard my voice
Maybe what, 2, 3, years or somethin
Up and down been high and low
Even been at the point of no return, no hope
Just wanna let my fans know that I'm still here
Y'all holla back
The sound was broken, too many years being political
Its kinda hard to do when everything your seeing is critical
Is all my fault what they said in the news
But its funny how the public seems to get it confused
They act like they ain't got nothin better to do
All they want is a statement, the hattin' is blatant
But we never paid attention to those who hate us
Til my face was on the cover of all the local papers
But still un-phased, I kept my cool
Plottin, carefully, every step I choose
And my, Cool-whit poin, and my write finery
Everybody wanna know my side of the story
Well here it is, the whole truth, plain and simple
This'll finally explain all the pain I've been through
And in no way shape or form of my provoken violence
Please try to understand my ""Broken Silence""",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-intro-broken-silence-lyrics

Star Cry,Brooklyn’s Don Diva,2008.0,"Lord have mercy, I'm so controversy
Bet you've never seen a star cry
I gave you my life; my blood, sweat, and tears
Hip-hop's bad girl for ten fuckin years

See I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
How can the spectators say Fox is stuck up
How can y'all judge my life, like I ain't have struggles
Sometimes I feel like I live inside a fuckin' bubble
I work hard for mines, baby, I'm a thoroughbred
And I don't care what channel 5 and the haters said
I will not cower, I will not conform
I've been through this rap shit too long
And vverybody wanna know 'bout Fox
Cause I'm the most controversial young rap bitch in hip-hop
And please don't shed me no tears, I need y'all prayers
The feds on my back, tryin to give me five years
And my P.O., stay tryin to violate me
That's why I make sure my piss is clean, my wrists is gleam
And my whip is sick, my six is mean
Paparazzi take flicks and see how the bitch lean
Uhhh, I'm every black girl's dream
Controversy sells, I was taught at sixteen
I spaz if you tempt me
Only black bitch to get press like the white bitches, Paris and Lindsay


Allow me to tear it all down
You gotta get the fuck back up if you fall down
Can't stumble or crumble, or let 'em see you drown
And I swear with every tear that I cry - I'm here now
Imagine how it feel to see your world torn down
This is not Fox that's speakin - there's no more Brown
Let me reintroduce myself and tear the wall down
Hold up - Let me take the platinum plaques all down
Let me take off my jewelry, the ring by my middle finger
Nice to meet you again, Hi, My name is Inga
I cry real tears - cuz I'm a real person
Look beyond my fur coats and Chanel purses
Put aside the Christian Dior, and look inside my soul
And see I'm just a little insecure
I'm just like y'all - but I probably hurt more
After thirteen years I feel I deserve more
And I single handedly changed the whole rap game
Bust a shot when y'all mention my name - Blockaaa, Brown


Only a bum bitch snatch bags and all that
It's 2007 - what the fuck you call that?
Yeah they jumped me - I had five bitches on my back
And I emerged unscathed without a motherfuckin' scratch
About an hour later, got all my shit back
Every motherfuckin' piece - bitch, I AM the streets
I'm Brownsville to Bedstuy, Flatbush, and the East
What other rap bitch could touch Brooklyn concrete?
Home of the crooks, and - step in any hood in Brooklyn
Bet you'll still see my Louboutin footprints",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-star-cry-lyrics

Give a bitch the 5 minutes of fame
Lot of broads ain't acting the same
Not that I knew 'em
But I passed them on a couple of corners
Racking they brain
And the 2 top bitches kinda slid off they game
And at the time I was going through my personal pain

Intimidated, slowly the love disintegrated
It's, (I just need a...) like I'm driving
Making a wrong turn, woo
I need stability, something that's long term and
Maybe a dude with no kids
But, he get deported I'm troopin' his whole bid now
(I just need a....) a dude that respect his moms
Ain't afraid of the marriage or pushin' our baby carriage, whoa
I come home and he runnin' my bath
Late nights, stressed out but he makin' me laugh and (*laughter*)
(I just need a....) a dude that my brothers approve
A thorough man by my side, if I win or I lose
But, if I'm cool or I'm spazzin', we still a team
Dubbin' hard in the dancehall bashment

I just need a, I just need a man
Strong and understands
All my life's demands, all my loving
I just need a, not jealous of me
Loves me for just me
Tellin' you the real is that I need a..
I just need a..

Built for the struggle and he, move with integrity
Can handle my celebrity
A dude that's in love with Inga, respect Fox
And put a blue stone on my finger
(I just need a...) and cry with me, if we fight, we fight
But if I'm right, if I'm wrong, I'm right
And, homie look, what you sellin' I ain't buyin'
With dude I'm done, tell him I ain't cryin'

I just need a, I just need a man
(Now ladies throw ya hands up high)
Strong and understands
(And tell 'em niggas no longer we gon' cry)
All my life's demands
(And this a new year now)
All my loving
(Y'all don't have to fear now, cuz ya girl Fox here now)
I just need a, not jealous of me
(So throw ya hands up high)
Loves me for just me
(And tell these niggas no longer we gon' cry)
Tellin' you
(And this a new year now)
The real is that I need a
(Y'all don't have to fear now, cuz ya girl Fox here now, yes!)
I just need a..
 (Until fades)
Lookin' for a thug oh baby, baby, baby (Yo 7, this is Fever man!)
I just need a..

BK Made Me,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Guiding, a dream
It's where, we always meet
I'm guiding, a dream
It's where, we alway meet

Got dreams of ending this bitch, My life is miserable
Make me end this shit, find my ass in critical
No, My nightmares come frequent like they rituals
But my words come swift, divine like the Pennicle
See, that's why I rock my shades, so when I cry
And my eyes are red, I can still hide my pain
Then I step on stage and, crowd is in a rage and
I make the first page and, my mission's complete
But when I step off of stage, it's back to reality
Problems still the same, and life's a fuckin' tragedy
Thoughts still the same and, I still dream of dying and
Taking some hard shit, to make me feel I'm flying and
Wish I was told I was carried as low
In this cold fuckin' world, I wanna fuckin' explode
Guess it's time for me to depart, know it sounds strange
But I served my purpose, and I made my mark
Cause...

Guiding, a dream
It's where, we always meet
I'm guiding, a dream
It's where, we alway meet

As long as the streets know it's a classic
Fluck all y'all envious bastards
I'm thorough when I'm, reppin' my borough nigga
Know tell me who could fuck wit', y'all put y'all money it
I make examples out of bitches, y'all don't really want it
Since Ill Na Na, I've been going through drama
And I get on my knees
And I thank, God for my momma
Since a youngin I been knowin', I be forever flowin'
Back in the lab biatch, back in my zone
No, thou shall not fuck with F to the Izz O
Bullshit aside, I got y'all rappers by a lanslide
Pardon me, I'm not your average, I'm a savage
When it come to this game, I'm as ill as my name
So Gav and Ant brought me back, I was sick of this rap
Sick of the fame, sick of niggas hauling my name
No, I can't quit
I'm as real as they get
Yes, back on the scene
Still reps no press
Cause...

Guiding, a dream
It's where, we always meet
I'm guiding, a dream
It's where, we alway meet

Death before dishonor
Born alone, die alone
My crew think I'm 7, bought a plane so I could fly alone
No security, got the nine through the stallion
Run through Louie, when I wanna get my style on
Body something, get the chair and I'll fry alone
The skylarking, six be moonwalking
No, who keeps a floss game like Fox and Pretty
In Kennedy with twenty Louie's like Akeim and Simmi
No, nobody grinning, don't take it as rude
I was a little too gangsta for the Moulin Rouge
Cause...

Guiding, a dream
It's where, we always meet
I'm guiding, a dream
It's where, we alway meet",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-bk-made-me-lyrics

Don't be scared, I'm the captain
Anything can happen to you, boy
But I won't hurt you, boy

Throw the pussy down like a porno star
Me and my girls real hard in the Bentley Arnage
A whife line skirt and chinchilla fur

In a glass top six and that's my bitch
F double O-X B double O-G-I-E

Ain't a bitch freaky like me

Memory Lane,Ill Na Na 2: The Fever,UnKnown,"Hip-hop, Brooklyn!

Damn, the rap game done changed
Everytime I turn around niggas spittin' nigga's names
'96 was when the love was real
When Big came and took the whole Brooklyn to fame
Straight off of St. James
Lookin' all Dapper Don, he threw on 
Party & Bullshit
, it was on
And, B.I.G. spot'll never be claimed
'Cause Mrs. Wallace, Cease and Roc they carry your name
And later on in '96 when Hovi came and
Ain't No Nigga
 was the key to his fame
Introducin' a little Brooklyn girl by the name of Fox Brown
About to shut this rap shit down and
To the world we was Bonnie & Clyde
And everything my nigga Jay said I'm ready to ride
Then 
I'll Be
 came to skyrocket our fame
And 2 million sales later bet I rode the same, and
[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & 
Nas

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane

Damn, the rap game done changed, and
Then Nas came and The Firm was born
We snatched AZ and Mega and our team was born
I took 'em on Puff tour, turn around Nas gone
And the whole crew follow, what a hard pill to swallow and
I had to thug it out and go in the zone
And rock 30 thousand on my muh'fuckin' own but
I couldn't break down, I couldn't moan
I got this Ill Na Na blood in my veins, I spar alone!
Then 4 weeks later Puff ended at home at the Garden
The show I came up on the throne
See I, can't believe my niggas left me alone
And I don't buy the shit about Puff was treatin' 'em wrong
How the fuck we tryna pull weight on this man tour?
At the time Puff 8 mil, the fuck you mad for?
That's the problem with niggas, see they worse than broads
Want a bitch to conceal they scars, yeah
[Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & 
Nas

Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves

Takin' niggas on a trip straight to Memory Lane

It's called the vapors
Soon as you stack some paper
These cowards got the nerve to face ya
They got the gall to page ya
How the fuck you have a lil' soldier and replace her with a dozier
But like I told ya Fox is a trooper
I'll walk straight pass ya like I never fuckin' knew ya
Listen man, I'm the first bitch to sign to Def Jam
How can't I be the best, I'm from the best, man
'97 was the year Kim came with her best plan
To go straight at her best friend
I thought it was a cute lil' spar
'Till I heard her on the Flex tape describin' my car
Mo' money, mo' problems, kid
I guess you never did expect me to blow this big and
I know my fans won the battle I fought
But understand I keep her breathin', I'm her life support

Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep,Ill Na Na 2: The Fever,UnKnown,"Hey
Yo Gav I'm wide awoke, fam
Fox

Am I the most prolific
Can it be that I'm one of the most gifted
I swear at times I'm so twisted
Outta all the occupations in the world I chose this shit
Momma, tell me, do I have what it takes to be
Irreplacably the best this place will see
And yes I'm hated
And will I go down in history as one of the most underestimated
Lord, speak to me, are these streets the key?
We don't snitch, we been sworn to secrecy
I never claimed I shot guys
I just came in the game to get my name and rep Fox 5
I'm so close yet so far but so far
No stars flow hard like I do
So many years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible

(Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord
(I pray the lord my soul to keep)
Yes, so may years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thng to rap's bible
(If I should die before I awake) Oh god
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
Fox, I gotta get my rhyme on
And everything I speak my mind on be word to Big

The industry lately's been terrible
I swear the timing's impeccable
Labels is bringin' in thin revenue
I don't mean to toot my own horn but damn, I'm incredible
See I gots to be, possibly
If not the best, yeah, fuck it the best MC
And I feel they testin' me now
I don't need Kelly or Beyonce to prove I'm Destiny's Child
Thin I'm losin' y'all, confusin' y'all
When I spit all I hear is ""ooh's"" and ""aww's""
And I don't need doubt
See it's just me, Red, Gav, Curtains, Mello & Young Mouse
A small portion of a dyin' breed
It's Fox-5 slash I-N-E but still
So many years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible

(Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh god
(I pray the lord my soul to keep)
Yes, so may years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible
(If I should die before I awake) Oh lord
(I pray the lord my soul to take)
Fox, I gotta get my rhyme on
And everything I speak my mind on be word to Pac

See, it's the streets that inspire me
This is my proof of what fire be
My songs will please the inquiry
My versatile personal flows written and shittin', it's like diaries
Never tired my job, I confide in God
And almost effortless simply defy the odds
With the best the placin'
Will I be able to succeed and lyrically exceed my expectations
If I gain some fame, I'll remain the same
It's so ill how one bitch changed the game
And I'mma do it a lot faster
I probably have to die before they realize I was the best rapper
Young Fox, I'm a spittin' beast
This rap game's a puzzle, I'm the missin' piece
But, so many years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible

(Now I lay me down to sleep) Oh lord
(I pray the lord my soul to keep)
Yeah, so may years you been lied to
I now provide you with the closest thing to rap's bible
(If I should die before I awake) Oh God
(I pray the lord my soul to take)

See it ain't no party like a Fox Brown party
Cuz a Fox Brown party don't stop
But them bottles a pop, when Fox Five come through in the drop
With chinchilla on my back, it's the King {bitch} of rap
Catch us ?, up in bungalow eight
Rollin' through in the cranberry SK8 and
Call the crew, tell 'em come to the crib
I did my time, it's all water under the bridge
I got knocked and it felt like a part of my life
But I'm, back home I'mma party tonight
Through the pool party since no-one else is home
All my friends happy for me tell me ""Welcome home"" and
Yeah I know I got busted for a crime
Now I'm tryna have fun and make up for lost times
The world is mine, I'm so refocused
But I'm back this time and I'm back to grind, so
 (Young Gav)
What you gonna do when you get out of jail?
I'm gon' have some fun (let's have fun then)
What do you consider fun?
Fun, natural fun (I like that)
We drinkin' on the liquor til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me (what you drinkin'?)
We drinkin' on the liquor til there ain't no more
Tell me if you drinkin' with me (I like that, c'mon)

And, this is how it's 'sposed to be
No police, all night, hopefully, cuz
We got Armadale vodka too, I got
One of my homies on the ones and twos and
The food is banging, the hate is gone
The speakers blasting the latest songs
And all that time they had me alone
Now I'm, with my family, I'm happy I'm home and
We two-stepping cuz it's back in style
My friends laughin' and acting wild
See this type of thing, happen all the time
But you gotta get yours, just like I'm gon' get mine
Everything is fine, with my friends I pack a whole place in
For one day I forget the probation
I won't stop til the party is done and see I'm gon' have some fun!


Ain't no party like a Fox Five party, cuz a Fox Five party don't stop
Ain't no party like a Fox Five party, cuz a Fox Five party don't stop

Yeah I made the crime, but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'mma take my shine
You see I made the crime, but I paid the time
And from this day on, I'mma take my shine, so, yeah
I can't forgive 'em, I'm living my life different
I'm seeing just what I'm missing, I ain't tryna go to prison again
They got me on constant watch, but
Anything is better than to be on lock

The hood love the style that I'm delivering
Fox is hip hop, they just can't rid of this
And all the pain and shit I went through
And all the foul niggas I been through
The world is mine, I'm back to grind
You know you the best when rap dudes go at you
But see my rep is so amazing
The streets, the hood are still craving
I still be rockin' in my Gucci
But switched it up to Emilio Pucci
I love it when hoes try to roll up
Cuz once they see Fox they fold up
And quickly switch they whole flow up

The place I shop (Magnetic!)
Balenciaga boots I cop (Magnetic!)
Or the Birkin bags (Magnetic!)
This why I got ya'll mad

Yeah, the Bentley, H2, the Rover
I'm back, this rap game is over
From Nas, the Firm and Young Hova
Fox a young soldier, will cock the toaster
Young Fox, the new version of Roxanne
The streets talking like what's her next plan
Is she signed to Puff now or Def Jam
That go to show y'all niggas, I'm the best man

Man they copy my style (Yeah, c'mon)

Kept him fresh, kept his lil toe game up
Now he wanna have this bitch in my Hummer truck?

Fuck the rap. I'm like, ""Yeah, bitch I'm back.""
Cops around? I lay this whole fuckin shit down. But I--
Keeps my cool
The last time I acted a fool, they had ya girl front page of the news!
""Hey! What up pimpin'?""
""See you all down here slippin', fake bitch on yo side of your hip""
""See I'm done with the lyin' and shit, the cryin and shit"" And--

All My Life (Black Girl Lost),Ill Na Na 2: The Fever,UnKnown,"This is the story of a black girl lost
The story of a black girl lost

I knew a girl name Tanesha from the Bronx
Grew up in Castle Hill with two nieces and her aunt
Her moms and her sister, everyday and night
Moms tucked her in and kissed her hugging her tight singing this song

Aww my little girl

She was born on October 22, right down in Houston Texas
From two parents living reckless
The day she was born the doctor covered her warm
Placed her in her mothers arms
Tears rang out while moms sing out

Aww my little girl

When she was three moved to N.Y.C
Pops got sent up north did a one to three stretch
Moms all alone struggling for paper
Her daughters can't eat had to borrow from they neighbors, damn

Aww my little girl

Age five life lop side that's when her pops died
And moms crying, still trying all alone in this world
No money and two girls of course
The sad reality of a black girl lost and singing

Aww my little girl

Age twelve she think she's a grown woman
Now she in the streets late nights on her own mission
I met her summer '98 front of her aunt's building
Her moms looking out the window telling her to get in, screaming out

Aww my little girl

Thirteenth birthday here come the problem
Nesha fell for some kid name Phillip from Harlem
Introduce him to moms her moms ain't like him
So she ran away from home her and her moms kept fighting moms singing

Aww my little girl

Thirteen still a youngin' out on her own
On the streets dummin' out of her zone
Choose man over her mother left out of her home
In the back of her mind she still hear her mom cryin' singing

Aww my little girl

Fourteen still hustling Nesha got pregnant
Phillip found out that's when relationship ended, damn
Ain't it sad cause the dude knew that he trapped her
She can't leave tangled in his rapture, damn

Aww my little girl

Late nights Nesha slept in the lobby
Either pitch for somebody or, tricking her body
Back to hustling her face got slit in a robbery
In the hospital all she can think of was mommy screaming

Aww my little girl

Now it's Nesha and her baby Tara
She swore to raise her baby proper and show her the way
One day look at her daughter saw her splitting image
Seen herself through her child, she cried watching her smile singing

Aww my little girl

Fifteen year old dope fiend, part-time moms
Used the money in stash from her part-time job
See her childhood days was gone she realized living was hard
Late night singing her song and saying

Aww my little girl

What could she do? no place to sleep, no food to eat
She wanna go home and leave this alone
Bumped into her moms Lorraine on Edgecomb
Moms hugged her and embraced her thank god that he saved her, damn

Aww my little girl

Late night on February 9th
Nesha trippin' in her sleep can't make it through the night
Asking god to take her from this life
And forgive her for her sins and the taking of her life screaming

Aww my little girl

She can't take it now ran into the kitchen
Grabbed a knife; on the edge her bed contemplating how
She could replace her life from all this pain
So she slit her daughters throat, dead",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-all-my-life-black-girl-lost-lyrics

Now everybody a gangsta nobody got cheddar
My dreams were so much better
Big money from gold getters
Minks in the cold weathers

Homicide Lu and Boy George
Just see him go to sleep in the car
And pop a few pills

That's how we get down
Yeah that's the way that we rollin'
That's how we get down {bang}
That's how we get down down
That's how we get down
Yeah that's the way that we roll
That's how we get down

I've been a star since a virgin in high school
Since the age of fourteen I've been a rap bitch version of Michael
And I don't know how to trust, the church or the rifle
God or the devil, the burner or the Bible
Got a black cloud on me, I've been cursed by my rivals
I'm back bitches! The return of ya Idol
F-to-the-O-X, B-double-O
Blackhand keep them Lambos and them black Impalas
I rep the Sty homie, ain't a bitch chilla
I fucks with gangstas baby, like Prince Miller
And when they locked Tuquan, I felt the East split up
He and his Feds, but he left his legacy in killa
I keep my killaz on that Brooklyn shit
Fox rep the world like the Brooklyn Bridge
I'm back now, Brooklyn ain't never looked this big
I hold it down while y'all lookin' for BIG


I'm a gangsta, I know who is who
I got that good gene, sittin' on that Louis shoe
I'm from Queens homie, now who is you?
I let my pound loose, I got hit with duces
I don't give pounds, I don't do truces
I take my Remy straight, I don't do juices
I don't sex gooses, I don't do chickens
Strictly 5th Ave, I don't do picken
I got my hood clickin', while the plot thicken
Put them lights up, lift them macs up
Send hot gal scared bring them stacks up
Get my mink, ah, nah bring the racks up
Try to press Fox, y'all don't worry her
In the club y'all see me like a 
I'm worldwide, I'm all in ya area
I'm a gardener, I could plant fear in ya",https://genius.com/Foxy-brown-how-we-get-down-lyrics
