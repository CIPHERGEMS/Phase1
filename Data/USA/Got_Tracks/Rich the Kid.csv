Flippa
Slaughter Gang, 21 shit
You know what I mean?

Hit a nigga in the head (Hit him)
We ain't shooting at the legs (Naw)
Back in the day had a trick bike, had a bad bitch on the pegs (Bitch!)
Some of my niggas bang blue (Crip)
Some of my niggas bang red (Blood)
Some of my niggas bang black (GD)
All of my niggas keep straps (Grrah)
Spend three hundred on a napp (Ayy!)
They sucking, fuck the whole trap

Quavo walking Warren Sapp (Sacks)
Takeoff buying only Act (Lean!)

Bought a Bimmer, wrapped it matte (Skrrt)
Got a shooter, peep hole out the back (Grraw!)
Never been a minority (Naww)
Take the pot and Chuck Norris it (Oh!)
You niggas looking unfortunate (Woo)
Different types of babies like a orphanage (Babies!)
I hit my money in the storage

The way I'm whipping up my wrist and shit (Whip it!)
Damn, this hoe she annoying
After I fuck her, I'm finna get rid of the bitch (Gone!)
What type of shit that he on
Go get the 30 young nigga, go empty the clip (Grraw!)

Slaughter Gang, I'm the king bitch
Mac 90 with the beam, bitch
Hi-Tech, you sipping green bitch
21, hold the pot with my left arm
Catching plays like Brett Favre
You a gold fish and I'm a fucking shark
Whip the pot nigga, whip it hard
AK make a nigga Hit The Quan
Gas bag like I own the farm
She blowing on it like she on a horn
100 round drum and that stick
Pull up, roll the windows down and I hit
You cuffing that bitch and she loyal to dick
Chasing money, I can't lay with no bitch
Murda Gang, we don't play with the beef
Put 'em on a plate and we gonna eat
Niggas snitching, I put 10 on the G's
Margielas, I put rent on my feet
Niggas pussy, I see through 'em they weak
Fuck 12, we keep shit in the streets
I brought her to the spot that bitch was a freak
Fucked her on the floor, can't fuck up my sheets

Offset!
We really invented you niggas
The judge tried to sentence a nigga
Fuck a partner, my .44 my nigga
Stuck in the pickle, grinding from a nickel
Trapping in trenches, two bricks in the rental
I'm crazy I'm psycho, it's 'bout to get physical
Run a circle 'round the plug, that's a pick and roll
Feds watching so I walk on my tippy toes
I'm rich as bitch, I want in on that lick
I'm not romantic, my bullet gon' kiss
Get in that pot, get the work in your wrist
I was born with the gift, got the fame and the grip
Hop in the jet and I take me a trip
Geeked out on codeine, I sip and I sip
Jump off the stage, I might jump out the VIP
I'm covered in money, covered like a quimp
I'm smoking on cookie, not smoking on piff
Don't talk to the police, not giving out tips
That ain’t that boot, that molly look too clear
I don't care what you heard, I jump straight in my Lier
Standing in the kitchen, cooking fish fillet
Run up my money, I stash me a Wraith
Don't run up on me nigga, pump your brakes
I feed you the .223, dinner plate!

Run up on me nigga, catch a slug
50 and the 40, I don't use a glove
You know we got the straps up in the club
I don't fuck with you, you a dub
21 Gang, we got weight
All of my nigga, we straight
Pull up on a nigga, we'll take
Headshot a nigga, leave him in a lake
Round table with the Migo Gang and the Slaughter Gang, we on break
Bitch too skinny I don't want her, fuck the bitch, the bitch might break
I got a hundred round drum on that K
I keep that bitch with me, you know that bae
Never let a nigga know where I stay
Have a nigga staking out where you stay
I get that cash, I ain't got time to play
Hold up that choppa, this mask on my face
Shoot out the doulie then pull off in the Wraith
Curious George, got bananas in K's
Pussy niggas turn to preachers like Ma$e
Finna slide to where I keep me a K
Juvenile hit a nigga with tre
On Tenwood, post with that K
WOO!

Whipping a brick with a frying pan
Made a 100k with a broke hand
Trapping down with the desert eagle
Actavis all in my 2 liter
Finessing the plug for a whole thang
Rollie all white like the cocaine
I got a freak with a nose ring
Cut that bitch down like I'm 2 Chainz
Walking around with a 100 thou'
I'm actually rich, you just talk about it
Pull up with choppers and air it out
I empty the clip in your mama house
Hit a jug for the work, still serving
Get rich or die trying like Curtis
I roll with a brick and she nervous
Pull out the Wraith when I'm flexing on purpose
I started trapping in first grade
I put the lean in a lemonade
I pour a four, got a fever
Dab school, I'm the teacher
Riding scrap with the nina
Big balling, no bleachers
100k for one feature
Bad bitch, she no keeper",https://genius.com/Rich-the-kid-migo-gang-x-slaughter-gang-music-lyrics

Fucking a ho out in Calabasas
Spitting the fire like a fuckin' dragon

Water whippin' and the pot too hot
Drinkin' lean, out the bottle
In the Aston Martin foreign with a model
Twenty racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with six hoes like 2 x 3

Got the trap house jumpin' like Jordan

The trap be jumpin', and bunkin'
The fiends they running, the money keep comin'
I'm kickin' hoes out like a punter
If I start shootin', turn to a track runner

Looking for me, pussy nigga you found me
I keep real money makers around me
All my niggas gotta stack up the cheddar
All my niggas got to get to the fetty
Pull off in a foreign like it's Andretti
Turn that pussy nigga's brain to spaghetti
This a Rover nigga, this not a Chevy
Keep a couple white bitches with me
Had to nickname her Lil Debby
'Cause she whip the fuckin' pot, ayy
Bitch, don't you run in my spot, woah
Bro had to remix the drop, woah

Plug meeting on the yacht
I was running from the cops
Whip a 'Rari with the egg beater
Trap jumping off the beeper
Bring that scale, fuck the 12
Drop a bird on the stove
Had to get it, god knows
Rich nigga, I was broke
Now I'm ballin' like a champ
Break a brick with a stamp
Them diamonds they shining, lil' nigga
The chopper, it hit you, my shooters official
Bought a chopper with a scope
They was hating, I'm the GOAT
Bad bitch roll the dope
Drop a baby in her throat

Woah, damn, I just might run for president
I ain't doing shows if it ain't dividends
Got a white bitch with a big booty
Boy I swear to god she so heaven sent
Damn, eighty that's just how I'm rockin', yeah
Nigga run up, that's his arm, that's his leg, that's his head
Then that nigga dead
That's what happen when you talk to feds

Pussy dripping, leave her leaking
I put that bitch in Chanel
I'ma fuck her in designer
I'ma put it right behind her
Bet a quarter milly in a week, ayy
Geeking on molly, can't sleep
Then I crashed the Maserati twice

Goin Crazy,Feels Good 2 Be Rich,2014.0,"Riding round in the A
In the coupe going crazy
I ain‘t worried bout shit, young nigga I’m rich
It’s fuck you, pay me
Don’t let your ho come around me
Imma take your lady (Imma take your bitch)
Riding round in the A
In the coupe going crazy 

Touched down in the A
Maserati to Bugatti, a motherfucker start running from the paparazzi
Got 4 hoes in the pool of my Jacuzzi
Pull up, drop top, Phantom opera a movie
You see the diamonds in my watch, it ain’t a G-Shock
Balenciaga on my feet this ain't no Reebok
I'm at the W, never ever been to the double tree
Eating steak & shrimp on the yacht, fuck Applebees
Gianni Versace,
 
I come to your city, take over like Nazi
I got hoes from the A to the bay
Riding round and the coupe going crazy


Riding round in my Audi coupe
I dare a nigga look at me wrong, cause I’m gon' shoot
I pass the OG stuffed crust cookie Snoop
I take the pot and eggbeater, they call it cookin' a deuce
When I step inside the ‘rari, call me Crash Bandicoot
Blood diamond came from Africa, call me Al-Farouq
Lil' mama with the big ol' booty, come here
Have you ever been in an 8 passenger leer
She going crazy, private jet going crazy
Told the bitch to give me head in my grandmama’s ...
I ain’t give her nothing
Nah, Quavo ain’t a lover
You think I give a fuck about a bitch, I ain’t a sucker
She the past tense, got to make lil' mama absent
Versace, Versace, my fabric
Counting money in the mansion, your girl in the living room dancing
And it don’t take nothing to drop her panties
Quavo! (Gone!)


Coming down Peachtree in the Aston
With a bad white bitch, Jennifer Aniston
Feeling Molly Santan’ again
My neighbors panicking
In my hood, every day I hear an ambulance
Ain’t a damn thing changed, still serving the J’s
Felicia, she want to borrow my microwave
Deebo still in the hood, creeping through your window
I’m fucking Mrs. Parker, took her to Puerto Rico
Me, Craig, and Smokey smoke dope and we be choking
Which watch should I wear today, the heavy Breitling or the Rollie?
Reached in my Robins and I pulled out guacamole

Fuck the lies, you can save that (Save that)
Niggas talkin' trash, ain't got no racks
I can fit a fifty in my knapsack (Knapsack)
Put another hundred in my backpack (Woo)
Teach you how to make a mil', I promise that
I really get the check and you can save the cap
I tell your bitch I love her, she gon' say it back
But I can't save a ho, that's a big fact
I forgot her number, I ain't save that (Brrt)
I can make one-fifty in an hour flat
I can make the money flip and double back
I'ma make another check and I'ma save that

Now I'm rapping, Motorola in the trash (In the trash)
All hundreds, tell promoters give me cash (Woo, woo)
I ain't cappin', put two-fifty on the dash (Skrrt)
And I ain't worried 'bout these bitches, want the bag
Fuck bein' famous
Came up from the bottom, but I made it
At the top, you get rich, but then they hate it
When you get that check, you better save it

Killing niggas like I pulled out the shovel
Got a pint, double cup as a trunk
In the kitchen with the pot makin' bubble

Brick disappearin' like magic
I left the trap with a broke wrist

In love with the money we marry
She claim me and got embarrassed
You a rat like Tom and Jerry
Wet you up like a Squirtle
I be trappin', I  can serve you

Pull up to the party with no roof
I bought a brand new Glock

Hold up, hold up lil homie, wait

Racks!
Cash, Woo

I might pop a perc and just go crazy
Fucking on your bitch like I want babies
Diamonds hit like Rocky bitch I'm famous
Walking with a hundred bitch I made it
Leaning and tripping on two pills
Sippin' on pints of the double seal
They told me to stop but I'm sippin' still
Yo hoe putting up but she know the drill
Momma' said be patient
I had no Mercedes
I was on the block I trapped that rock, like back in the 80s
Just know that I pour up a whole pint
Like fuck it I'm back on the dirty Sprite
I'm catching the plays like Jerry Rice
My young niggas killing might take your life
My teachers said I couldn't do right
Pull up in Porsche and it's all white
I'm all in her head like fucking lice
Play with the money you pay the price

What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me

I might pop a xan and just go lazy
But I got them workers so they pay me
I got all these bitches like I'm pimpin'
And your baby momma' now she drippin'
Walking around with a lot of cash
Rari' I ride with a paper tag
Momma' she said that I'm living fast
I need to slow down but I do the dash
Put my wrist in it when I'm whippin' up
I got your bitch she gon' cook it up
Fuckin her all on the furniture
She don't speak no English a foreigner
Bitch quit playing I'm dangerous
I got the molly and Katy
I'm fuckin her she call me baby
Ain't go for it, you better pay me
Dressed in Givenchy I'm dabbing
Bricks disappearing no magic
You talking my money it's savage
A whole lotta' racks cause I gotta have it

What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it

At the Greyberry, laid up with two bitches
She sucked that dick like her teeth missing
That ass so fat but it’s paid for
She can ride that dick like a skateboard

Soon as I left she shot a text
Said she was feeling my feng shui
And the way that I macho man flex
I put her on molly, she sneaking and geeking
I fucked her, she wet on my Givenchy sheets
Giuseppe steppers or the red bottoms

She like to whip up my extras
We gettin' money forever
Quarter mil, dug it up with a shovel
Too much water, my diamonds a puddle
Thanking god I came up from the struggle
Wait, I cannot fuck with no busters
Half of these niggas be suckers
Get the bag and I tell them to truck it
Smokin' dope and you know it's so musty
Yeah, we pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it through dedication
I'm swervin' in something, she devastated
I'm winning, don't need your congratulations
Wait, most of these niggas they hating
Look up and told mama I made it
Don't give a fuck 'bout these ladies
My watch on my wrist cost me eighty
Everybody wanna go this way
Fuck your bitch, make her go that way
Rich, I might pull out a black Wraith
Ain't talking unless it's 'bout Rackaids

We pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it, it's no debatin'
Might walk with a hundred for motivation
My bitches they fuck off a conversation
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready

Ball tomorrow
Rich bought an Audemar
Call up Tavar
Caught a charge
Riding the wave so hard
Everybody wanna go get a Goyard
Y'all niggas ain't ready
Rich Forever pockets too heavy

They wanna copy the wave
They wanna ride the wave
I told my bitch to behave
Might put the coupe through surgery
Trappin' with a lil bit of burglaries
My pockets they look like a burger, B
Your diamonds is rusty, from Tiffany's

You got to be kidding me
Did the rackies and now she into me
Diamonds African, whips from Italy
Niggas chopping up bricks, do surgery
Diamonds cutting up, shits do surgery
She all on my dick, she heard of me
If you look like a lick it's burglary
Red bottoms, kicks look like a murder scene
Get the money, it's simple
Big chopper, shit's poppin' like pimples
Niggas talkin' but that's not what we into
Pull up, put some hoes in your rental
She give me the brain, the mental
Diamonds beating like instrumentals
You ain't getting no guap, why the fuck you waiting?
I might go drop the top for motivation

We pullin' up with no invitation
I finally made it, it's no debatin'
Might walk with a hundred for motivation
My bitches they fuck off a conversation
Told y'all Rich Forever pockets too heavy
Y'all niggas ain't ready

Trap Dab 2 (Intro),Streets On Lock 4,2015.0,"I don't really fuck with niggas, and I don't really fuck with bitches
Fuck the fame, I want the riches
I turned myself to a young Diddy
Young rich niggas in the building
Yung Rich Nation, is you with it?
Yung Rich Nation, is you with us?
Chopper gon' turn you to lettuce
Just wait on it nigga, you better be patient
My diamonds ancient
Walk on the North and they banging
Trap out the bando, we slanging
You niggas should go to the medical
You put your hoes up on a pedestal
They cuffing 'em, arresting 'em
I smash 'em, I get the best of 'em
Dreams I woke up in Raris
And now I'm swerving in the lanes in 'em
With fifty chains and bad bitch
And she say that she wantin' my purple pickle
Oh, my diamonds like Skittles
Green diamonds like the Riddler
Fifty bricks in the Fisker
Keep a shooter, Derek Fisher

I keep a shooter with a semi
Pull up trapping out the Bentley
He got the birds, and he got the pigeons
Out in Dallas moving Dirk Nowitzki
We set the hood on fire, moving that base
We want them cookies, we fly to the bay
You come around us and you watch what you say
We pop us a seal and we pour out the pint
I don't give a fuck, I got tats on my face
Money to blow and got money to waste
Money to count and got money to make
Young rich nigga, put a stack on my plate
Go back and forth and we never debate
Now she wanna fuck and I told her too late
Most of these niggas be fake or two faced
You try one of my niggas, get shot in your face

I just touched down from LA
The cookies I smoke from the bay
They saying I'm very important
Don’t see me if you were in them forces
Rich nigga, I'ma buy the bitch some red bottoms
If the Rollie tick tock then you got a problem
F&N, point blank range, headshot 'em
You ain't seen 'em on the block then the feds got 'em
You touching my coke then that's dangerous
She got the dope in her anus
I got the paper, way too many pages
You niggas just wanna be famous
Your bitch, she a ride like Six Flags
Stand on the block, I'm still trapping the gas
Walking around with a whole lot of cash
Still asking them why is they mad

Shoot at these acting niggas, Tyler Perry
Go to Dallas to Houston like I'm Jason Terry
My lil nigga gone drive them bricks to the mayor
Dirty Harry, nigga shoot like the sheriff
Twenty choppers with banana clips
I declare nigga guerrilla warfare
I put them bales in the air
I'm in LA like Fresh Prince of Bel-Air
Ed Pryor they rare
This ain't Beverly, this Moncler
Went Louboutin shopping, spent brick fare
Key to the city, got 10 pair
Plug just sent me ten thousand xans
Came in a teddy bear
Hit me a lick and went to Africa to go get diamonds like Sincere

Dab Flippa daddy, trap out the Caddy
If you need the skirts then just send the addy
I got three accountants, they do the adding
Thin mint my cookie, don't do the mountain
Migo mansion came with a golf course
Porsche truck came with good suspension
Throw the judge a bankroll to trim down the sentence
And if he was shooter you'd know he's no witness
So much gold, think that I was from Egypt
Me and Benji best friends, you know that I need him
Free all my niggas, don't play with your freedom
Fifteen hundred cash for the first one that beats us
Stop drop and pop, you think I'm Kyrie Irving
Me and Takeoff popping seals like they virgin
Slam dunk the pussy like I'm Kendrick Perkins
She bad and suspicious, but which one she working

I'm from Atlanta
We're toting them hammers, Amanda
Pour up a 4 right inside of a Fanta
I got them keys to the city, no janitor
Never been, but I got bitches in Canada
Running around the city like a damn animal
Go out in public, they pull out the camera
Pull up and hop out, they staring
Young nigga fresh out that brand new McLaren
We sip that lean, not no beer
Pop a Percocet and hop on the leer
I am Lil Duke, and lil bitch it's my year
Hop in the two seater, I'm switching gears
Should be awarded for dab of the year
I cannot see it, you are nowhere near
Talking about beefing, I'm riding your shit
I'ma young boss and ain't going out like Mitch",https://genius.com/Rich-the-kid-trap-dab-2-intro-lyrics

Change,Migo Lingo,2015.0,"Pull up in a Bentley, flexing, wearing 20 chains
Spent a hundred up in Neimans that ain't nothing but change
I'm a young rich nigga, ain't gon' never change
Spilling lean on my Robins cause I had to change

The money didn't change me and I'm rich and I'm famous, yea it just made me more dangerous
Hop fresh out the banana boat with the dope and it sell like a rope like in slavery
Im fucking the bowl, wrist out of control, Quavo told me whip that lil' baby
Tokyo diamonds on African gold im serving like Mitch in the 80's
The Bentley the color of gravy, I whip Mercedes damn and potatoes
Popping the seal like I beef with the navy, 22 chains on the back of your lady
That brand new Mulsanne watch me crome through in the thang' I'm in it and I blew out the brain
I'm gone need both of these lanes I leave with yo ho cause she know you a lame

Pull up in a Bentley, flexing, wearing 20 chains
Spent a hundred up in Neimans that ain't nothing but change
I'm a young rich nigga, ain't gon' never change
Spilling lean on my Robins cause I had to change

Young rich niggas, still pulling up with pistol
Young rich nigga fuck it so I bought a missile
Twenty chains on me he only took one, got goons on the hunt that do it for the fun
Walk in the bank, a hundred thousand on my waist
A nigga thought I had a fucking bomb
I put it the Nawf on the map, we make the bando the trap
I put the work in her hands, she boomerang money bring it back
Got twenty chains on when I serve ya, look at the coupe it just came out of surgery
You want a zip nigga? That's just for me
Nigga hit my phone when you want a whole P

Pull up in a Bentley, flexing, wearing 20 chains
Spent a hundred up in Neimans that ain't nothing but change
I'm a young rich nigga, ain't gon' never change
Spilling lean on my Robins cause I had to change

Sipping and spilling the lean, I'm living the dream, my chopper got infared beams
Twenty chains on it's a half in my jordans, bitch from Bermuda she trapping in Beverly
I'm stashing the bands in the basement, my shooters they aim at your faces
Whipping up work in a vacant, walk in the trap you can taste it
She say I got too many chains on, some niggas they say that I changed on 'em
Fuck what you saying, my diamonds they kill like they came from Japan
Got plenty of gas in the back of the Bentley, I'm flexing again
Way more chopper than a Pakistan, still in the kitchen with bitches quit playing

Pull up in a Bentley, flexing, wearing 20 chains
Spent a hundred up in Neimans that ain't nothing but change
I'm a young rich nigga, ain't gon' never change

Whole lotta money on the table, pesos

That's not my baby like Maury
Lil' bitty bitch, stop calling

Vlone on me, yeah, dat way
I took that ho out to London
Meeting my plug outta country
I got to keep flexin'

I was just hustlin', I wanted the check
I did fuck it up, made it back a thousand times
Who's trap bad beating letting it alpine
I got the Raf Simons on me
And I knew I would do what God told me
Still buying more rings on the go like Kobe
Young nigga in the trap with the OG's
My bitch is Bad and Boujee

These niggas they what, acting like groupies
She ate a Macdonald's but wanted some sushi
Broke ass bitches, 
Young rich nigga in the coupe, yeah the Bentley
Diamonds on my neck play tennis
Broke nigga don't talk just shut up

Want a new Bentley truck I'ma cashout

Bankroll to big pull my pants up

Drink lean in the morning like Starbucks
You can't be my girl, I'm sorry
Ain't loving these hoes they garbage

Bitch make shawty crack, like they in the 80’s
Thugga wear Versace, she rock Old Navy
Everybody swagging, got these bitches debating
Nigga living life just like Walter Payton
How many times have I told you that Thugga got rich off a sentence?
How many times have I told you I like my Henny and Remy?
How many times have I told you that I would send you a lil remedy?
How many times have I told you that I would eat you like Denny's?
No JC, I buy her pennies
I took her out of the cheap shit
I bought her the mink now she fizzy
Oops I meant fuzzy, I pray that bitch is my bousin (Suwoop!)
You pray that bitch is my cousin, and now she say that we dirty

Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
I got girls kissing girls while they in the shower
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower

Breaking down bales of tree early in the morning
Garbage bag full of grass like I just mowed the lawn
Got a super plug, so I got super power
I feel like Austin Powers, real gangsters move in silence
Doing 150 in the coupe, I just love the rush
It’s a cold world we live in, and so in my chopper I trust
100 shots I bust, 100 motherfucking P's of Reggie on that motherfucking Greyhound bus
I feel like MC Hammer, I can’t be touched
He tried to charge me but he broke, so it can’t be much
Hating get you nothing, money bring you Austin Powers
I swear these niggas just like this blunt, man these niggas sour

Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
I got girls kissing girls while they in the shower
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers

The bitches they hated, they said I wouldn’t make it
Young nigga I’m finally rich

Pull up with Soulja, these bitches gon' bother me
More pints than a pharmacy
Covered in gold, you cuffing these hoes
Was broke but I’m touring the globe
Young rich nigga, whole lot of cash on me
This chain on my neck worth four Rolexs
The Audemar look like a waterfall
The trap is jumping, no basketball

Rich nigga got bricks in the wall

Now it’s QC the Label and I’m sitting at the top nigga
You a lame ass nigga, still cuffing these hoes

You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back
You ran with that dabbin’, now give it back
I think that it’s time that you give it back

Who brought Versace back?
Who’s bando was the trap?
You know we invented that
You can go look it up on the internet
Give it back, give it back, give it back
Make that bitch put the dope in her kitty cat
Maison Margiela, I mix and match
Watching my dab like it’s cinemax
Dab on them folks, dab on them folks, I do it
Eat it up, eat it up ‘til you get full
We ball like Kareem, I’m talking that bull
Smoking on gas, smelling like cow manure
We trendsetters, we piped em up with the dab
Infected, you niggas spread it like a rash
Emmitt Smith, we brought the stakes, need the cash
I’ll take you to dab school, 10 thousand a class

Baow, I shot him with the gun
I should’ve played for the Phoenix Suns
I got a white ho, she a nun
I met the plug in Vietnam
You taking my dab, you the Migos’ son
Counting up guap at the top of the Renaissance
Preaching the dab like I’m Quavo reverend

(Dab, dab, get em Flippa!)
Put your head in your arm like you’re sneezing
My dick in her mouth like she teething
And I go crazy with it like a heathen
I’m the first one that dabbed with the leg kick
Took it, I could’ve gave you an assist
You claim you dab king then you taking a risk
I can teach you how to move but it’s gon’ cost a brick

Who dab is that? Who dab is that?

Broke niggas gettin’ mad
Hating nigga you a clown homie
Dab king, put the crown on me
Look at my dab, bad bitch
Foreign thick, red with the ass on her
She think I’mma put a few bags on her
I fuck her one time and I dab on her

I fuck her one time and I dab on her
After I fuck her then I call a cab on her
My niggas serving that cash only
My niggas trap on the block with them bags on me
Who dab is that, niggas know we invented that
Fathered you babies, I fed em that Similac
Ain’t no discussion, you know we gon’ handle that
 then went and dabbed, that’s a dab attack

Yeah

Dab went world wide
We gave the whole world dab fever",https://genius.com/Rich-the-kid-who-dab-is-that-lyrics

Greedy,Keep Flexin,2016.0,"I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle
I count paper, don't read it
Call me Mister Big Shot
I hit then won't stop
Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy

Let me pick and roll, say you want the play play
Want a fix huh? Slide in your playground
All she know is big business, all I know is gettin' in it
I walk through some doors, just bought the coupe, no ceilings
Nah, I ain't tryna just spend it, but fucked around and threw rain here
All I know is we runnin', Forrest Gump into the money
Told her, ""It's bedtime"" wrist on wristwatch
She said, ""Daddy don't stop"" leave the band on my spot
Nope, they talkin' in the street, some are chasin' that Summer breeze
Face on a wall like Mona Lisa, 
clap that ass, don't need no audience
So cold, leave the Summer , hope you ain't on no teasin' teasin'
So fine you ain't gotta sneak her, kick a little then we get to sneakin'

I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle

Call me Mister Big Shot

Doing big, can't stop
She only calls when she needy

She be callin', she fiendin', four in the mornin', she need it
You a fool when you eat it, my flex on her for no reason
I'm in Paris, she freakin', neck cold, wrist freezin'
Waterslide, she leakin', straight to fuckin', ain't speakin'
From the bottom, got this shit out the street, I was hustlin', made a mili a week
Overseas, on a jet for the cheese, fifteen hundred just for my jeans
All she know is big business, flexin' up 'cause I'm winnin'
Copped the foreign a new Bentley, she wanna peel with that 
Why they hatin', pull up Lamborghini, model bitches out the magazine
Lil' foreign put on for the team, makin' money, you can't intervene
One hundred, I can never switch up, too foreign, got my trunk in the front
Bad bitch, give her dick and a blunt, too greedy, talkin' 'bout what you want
Rich!

I don't wanna get greedy
She only calls when she needy
Got bands in the duffle

Y’all just talkin’ ‘bout my face in the Forbes
A lot of rat bitches fucking on the floor
I am the greatest, mama I made it
Flexing in Hollywood and they hate it
I don’t really need no new friends
Met a bad bitch at the Ruth Chris
Givenchy and Louis, I’m dabbing some more
I came from kicking them doors

Went and bought a chain with my first check
I got out of jail, bought a new TEC
Sniper, sniper, it gon’ take you off
I was juuging, came up on the north
Gas, molly, used to trap the soft
Had to make it, but I took a loss
Bet you can’t do it like me
Got her on the Mike, now she geeked
I been counting money, can’t sleep
I done made 100k in one week
I’m the GOAT, pull up with a hammer
Magazines, I’ma fight in Atlanta
I’ma pick a bitch off of the runway
On the boat with Pablo like Kanye

And she suck dick good, better choke

Pockets filled with asparagus
Walk in the kitchen, experiment
Baby you know I got to go, I need that paper
Murder scene put chain cut like a shank
I told you I don't need help, I had to hustle myself
Everybody stop and they starin'
I think I might want a Mclaren
Overseas in Paris
The altar with money, we married
Look at my water, that's clarity
Verified like a parakeet (brrrppp)
Niggas askin' for a handout
I was really hustlin' in the street

Bitches in the kitchen, dancing, water whipping chickens
I’m addicted to that paper, got to get that guala
I know niggas that’ll kill you over 20 dollars

Now money ain’t shit to a rich nigga
I got killers and gorillas that’ll deal with you
Snag a rapper on the roof, poof, with my shooter
And my pockets over  like that whore ass 
I ain’t got to shoot ya, cooling in Bermuda
My money long like the bus, your money like a ruler
Bitches in the kitchen dancing, water whipping chickens
Js in my trap they got a room just for sniffing
Now I’m trapping out the mansion, moved up out the bando
All my killers move in silence like they’re dressed in camo
I will put you in a box and ship you to your mother
I got all white bricks like Janet Jackson’s brother


There he is, it’s Chill Will
Done bust more guns, then wild Bill
Yeen got to play hard, take it easy baby
Cause I’m making cash money just like Weezy baby
Her ass so fat, no butt pad
My pockets so fat, look like 
Imma take your ass to school, real talk
No school but  full of white chalk
I’m strapped up, act up
Pull the knife out, give your ass a tummy tuck
The trunk, back up
I looked in the rear, white unit backed up


Why the fuck they call you dirty when your ass so clean
My bitch real nice but that ass so mean
I just pulled up in a Benz, bout to hop out in a ‘rari
I’m shitting on these niggas, excuse me, sorry
16 hours in the kitchen, I’m cooking up that yayo
That money come fast, watch me stack em up like legos
When the bricks touch down they hasta luego
Say she’s a Migos fan so I pass that ho to Quavo
Migo got a U-Haul truck I told a nigga send that shit
The money coming rapidly, that’s exactly how I spend that shit
Got them shooters all around toting 45s and Ks
You niggas plan on robbing me, bitch nigga not today

I am America’s top trap idol
And as a teen I was packing the rifles

24 inches, I ride in that Chevy
Pick up my wallet, that shit kind of heavy
Bitch see my face and that bitch call me pretty
Beat up that kitty and nut on her titty
Told that lil bitch don't you dare act siddity
Your ass is fake and your weave looks shitty

Bitches fucking for some Remy
She was flexin', drive a Camry
I told that bitch don’t you call me
Got her geeked up on the molly
Sent her home in a cab
Goyard, got the racks
Put Atlanta on my back
I was broke, I got the sack
Flippa running with a Mac
Lil Yachty in the trap

Louboutin with the Supreme
I trap Yao Ming, do you know yadda?
Photoshoot, Flippa in teen magazine
The cap ain’t nothing, nigga it ain’t what it seems
See my bitch then make a play when I serve a scene
Stay down, stay 100, and expect greater things
30 racks, 30 rounds, it’s in my jeans
Get money, fuck bitches, it’s in my genes

I remember in high school I was serving the beans
15 hundred for a young nigga’s jeans
Young nigga, I’m the king of the teens
Dick deep, make the pretty bitch scream
Young nigga, I’ma fuck up a check
Two months, I’ma say check my neck
I’ma call up Flippa, tell big bro bring the TEC

Revenge is so costly
Tell me what would you pay

I was trapping I was lying to my mama
Niggas hating I was looking for a come up
What would you do for a rollie a bust down
The price of the fame is too much now
Taking trips on the bus when I was jacked
Real niggas they'll die about respect
Back then I was broke now I flex
Pull up in a Bentley or Maybach
The rari I ride in Miami
I promise you won't understand me
I gotta provide for my family

Everybody wanna be a rich nigga
In the mall bad bitches take pictures
I don't trust no hoe can't kiss her
I was born , my wrist go get it
The fact that I'm rich but grind forever
Look at the rollie its presidential
Came in the game for the gold medal
Walking around with a gold bezel
What would you do for the millions
They said I wouldn't make it

Sipping the lean out the ceiling actavis smoking on cookies

Walk in the trap with a spatula
Dropping the top and I laugh at her
Niggas they dab then they mad at her
From the bottom now I'm selfish chopper
On the road getting money I ain't stopping
I need a guy have a master plan
Touring the country I thank the fans
I just need a tour bus with a stove in it
Little bit of money bought more bitches
I cannot talk on the phone with ya
Chasing the paper need more riches
When you broke ain't nobody there with ya
Got niggas they getting it life sentence
Police can see me in a Porsche tinted
Flexing for bitches that Benz rented
 came till tomorrow
Please do not ask me to borrow
Spending your money on clothes and louboutins
But cannot pay your car note

Walking around with a fifty, Versace like Biggie
I’m rich, but your pockets are empty
These bitches calling and stalking young nigga
The king of my city, two chains but no Tity
I’m richer than Diddy
I’m trapping the Hannah and Lizzy
The lean is killing my kidneys, Monefa she got to stay with me
I came from the bottom, back then I was starving
Capping and trapping and robbing
You can hate me now but I won’t stop now
Young nigga walk round with a touch down
My mama she told me these niggas they fake
They plotting, they know that you made it
I had to stay patient, I waited
Fuck nigga I’m finally famous
Flex on my shoes, know my Trues, Diamonds ocean blue
You taking her out for a dinner and movie, she fucking the crew
You wife her, you taking lil mama, young nigga she laughing at you
You fucking that ho no rubber, she a prostitute!

What you tryna do shawty, I’m a millionaire
I got bands on me, jumping out of helicopters, eating steak and lobster
I get guala with my partners
I’m in Haiti, bitch I ain’t gon have no problems
I got rich nigga problems
I got issues, I got motherfucking problems
I got problems, I got rich nigga problems
Young nigga I came from the bottom
Now that I’m rich I got problems",https://genius.com/Rich-the-kid-problems-lyrics

Passed out, I just poured out the pint
Walk in the trap and it stank
I told that bitch cut on the sink
So many racks like the bank
Passed out on the four out the pint
Walk in the trap and it stank
I told that bitch cut on the sink

Told mama I would be rich forever
Now I’m riding in a Masi, rich forever
Niggas hating then I bought a bigger bezel
I be staying on the stove like a kettle
Play with the keys like Zaytoven
In the trap, wrists moving, J’s smoking
She from overseas, Rolex get away
Maybach pull up, get in it
Let your main bitch fuck and then I drop her off
In the Goyard ballin’, no basketball
Fuck 12, said a nigga free Gucci
Have your bitch wipe me down like Boosie
I be in Hollywood swerving
Like the president, back of the Suburban
They been hating on me but I run it up
Everybody been waiting on the Trap Talk
I broke my wrist, 360
This bitch so hot, saddity
You was just mad ‘til you fell off
I was getting money out in New York
Fucking your bitch, then I leave her
I had to trap out the Beamer
I’m talking the trap out your speakers
Bust in your bitch like a desert eagle",https://genius.com/Rich-the-kid-rich-forever-outro-lyrics

Knew the money would change me
Look at my chains, my diamonds they wavy
Bitches they tried to play me, now these hoes asking for babies
My whole life changed all in one year
In the kitchen made a brick disappear
Lot of ice, whole block in my ear
It took a lot of hard work to get in here
Police they say they have evidence
Free my niggas, that's irreverent
Taking trips out to Beverly
God said I was heaven sent

Wake up and I gotta go get it
Rich nigga I done ran up a million
You can ask me how I did it
I'ma tell you go get it

Coupe going crazy
Looking at my diamonds they wavy
I knew that the money would change me

Bitch I got rich and I'll never change
Came in this bitch with the Migos gang
I'ma make your ho do the dishes
High class trap nigga in the Fisker
Real shit, I'm living like Diddy
New York right now smoking cookies
Made a hunnid, when you see me I'm flexing
What the hell I ain't do no texting
In the field getting pints outside Texas
Sipping syrup in the morning, no breakfast
I heard they said I'm a superstar
All of my trap got them burglar bars
Came from the hood now I'm switching cars
Thanking the lord that I made it far

Wake up and I gotta go get it

I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move

Riding round hundred bands on me, nigga no strap, I ain’t working that one
Say you don’t like me when you see me, like Matt , we can get to clapping
I’m working the move, bitches whipping powder in my new factory
If 12 bust a move, nobody is snitching, the work is not ‘ttached to me
Woah, you better move, don’t be mistaken by my Loubotin shoes
I’m not a fool but I dropped out of school
I made a million on the avenue
Look at the critics, they want to ask me
Look at the bitches, they want to smash me
McJacking, dabbing, and I came from 
Power move, and we move out to a mansion

Fake watch buster can’t bust me, I ain’t working that move
Cuffing these bitches, I ain’t loving these bitches, you do it
Riding round the city, no pistol, I ain’t working that move
Telling on your partner, talking to the police, I ain’t doing it
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move
I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move, I ain’t working that move

Wrist Gone Crazy,Rich Than Famous,2014.0,"Hold up, stop, grab another pot
Whip it, re-rock, cause my wrist gone crazy
Hold up, stop, get another pot
Whip it, re-rock, cause my wrist gone crazy

Baking soda beats, chickens Imma cook a feast
In the trap nigga everybody finna eat
I got a band, Molly Santan, wrapping the work in saran
Plenty of dope, moving the coke, I live in a boat
And my plug he want 5 just like John Papi
Imma juug him for the rest, bitch you can’t stop me
Cooking up like 6 bricks, in the trap with my new bitch
Diamonds dancing, my new wrist
Stay in the kitchen, I water whip
All she do is complain, I don’t know her name
Bando, I got white and the Mary Jane
Get you gone, back than I was starving
Run up on my niggas, Imma hit you with that carbine
Run with the Glock, hugging the block, I got the dope in my sock
Cook with the pot, kitchen is hot, whipping the rock
I’m from , chopper get to spitting
Houdini, the brick is missing

The fuck you saying, niggas got plenty of grams
You’d be like oh damn, you don’t understand
I was chilling on the block with my boy Rowdy
Ain’t seen that boy Bobby, he just caught a body
Migo gang swerving in lanes, too many chains
Got shooters, they aim at your brain, this ain’t a game
If she talking bout my money that’s a whole lot
In the kitchen I'ma whip it with an old pot
Some niggas they’d rather be famous
I got the crack like 80’s, young nigga with whole lot of babies

Hold up, stop, grab another pot

Backend  a ticket on meeting her

Left the club with two ho's now they strippin'
Shoppin', shoppin', shoppin', bitch you boppin'

She got a shoppin' problem, and I got a dabbin' problem
The mansion it came with commas, we set a new trend and we start from the bottom
Never slippin', dab is always drippin', and my roof is missin', and the  missin'
Cartier clear frames, bitch I got good vision, pocket rocket in the club wearin' 
Bathing ape, Maybach drake
My youngins eat OG Flippa cut the cake
I do not discriminate I hit every race, addicted to lean fell in love with the taste
I spend a whole 20 then pull out some more, I used to kick doors out a Honda accord
Hit a missionary til' she gets sore, and when we count condos we count the whole floor

Thousand Times,Feels Good 2 Be Rich,2014.0,"I got 8 chains on, 6 rings on, feel like Jordan

I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times

I done fucked up a sack, had to make it back
Had to hit a juug, hit licks in all black
The struggle, the struggle, the struggle
I got to go get it in bundles
Ain’t nobody give me shit, bitch I had to juug
I done ran up a sack, now my family good
The haters see me on top, I’m grinding, they wish I would stop
I’m tipping the strippers, the hundred, the fifty, the twenties
I get to the money
The kitchen, I’m cooking and whipping and flipping
The bricks I serve in a dummy
Our money Gianni Versace, the Gucci, the Louis, the Fendi
I’m trapping and eating at Bennys
You broke, you eating at Wendys
I done fucked my  up like 1000 times
If it ain’t guala than please don’t waste my time
Trapping, it turned into rapping
I don’t even know how it happened
Vacations across the world
I’m cooling, I’m chilling, relaxing

I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times

I perfected my hustle, all you rappers in trouble
My first bed was a single, the money under it double
Yeah I came from the rubble, now I’m a diamond the rock
And your bitch want a shot, we know her nigga gon block
Just to get to where I’m getting, nigga take a second
Cold shit dropping and they say I got the lake effect
Hot boy, but every time I hit em I can make em wet
They say he getting money, well little homie place a bet
See I done fucked it up and made it back 100 times
A new watch, a new whip, homie you can see the signs
And if you can’t see that, then you’re probably blind
Nigga say he get it like me, then he probably lying

I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times

I ain’t never been worried bout no dollar, nigga
Cause getting what I want ain’t never been no problem, nigga
I got watches, I got chains, I got coupes and trucks
Revolvers, automatics, when we shoot em, duck
I’m from the ghetto where they smoke, snort, and shooting up
And for them robbings choosing  niggas boosting stuff
If it’s a  my BGs booting up, rolling up
Heavy skunk, cop a brick, shave it down till the corner cut
Make 40, then burn it up
Off of that one night of turning up
I done made it back a million times, a million times
Off a million grinds
Now my Cuban bracelet got a million diamonds
And a hater blocking, tryna stop this shining gon get this iron

I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, I stayed on my grind
Tried to block me, tried to stop me, you can’t stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine
I done fucked it up and made it back 1000 times
Niggas hated on my struggle, tryna stop my shine
Got to hustle off the muscle and take care of mine

Imma take that bitch, no repo
In the track and I’m moving them elbows
Stuck in the trap, no Velcro

Wrist is Katrina, call FEMA
They walking around with the rat,  arena
She used to ball like the Pacers
Tell her how we like to ball like Lakers
Money long, got acres
Fucking all night, we gon need new neighbors

Got a red bad bitch from Jamaica, she ball like Lakers
Her money real long like acres, she go and buy makeup

Drinking the cup with the Actavis
My little niggas strapped like a terrorist

Call me on my phone, I don't say shit
I make money when I talk
I'm a boss, take a loss
I could introduce you to the plug
Bitch, this ain't no Henny in my cup
Stayed down, now the racks up
She gon' let me fuck, ass up
Plug, I stuck kis in the Louis V
Fuck 12, I’m a G, ain't no stoppin' me
And my wrist is on overseas
Rich nigga, you can't talk to me

Plug walk
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off

Splashin (Trap Symphony Version),UnKnown,2019.0,"Ayy, we can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
Never bring a freak to your spot
Dolce and Gabbana on my flip flops
I don't do no relaxing
Run up the bag, get the cash in
Fendi, am I drippin' or I'm splashin'
12, they can't catch me when I'm passin'
How you got a check and went broke again?
Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em
Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em

Off-White with the Gucci, I might mitch match
When I fuck her, you can get your bitch back
What the hell she was thinking? I can't kiss that
Why she ask me where the hell I got my wrist at?
Why the hell a hundred-thousand in my backpack?
Why these bitches think that we can come in contact?
This is my drank, this ain't cognac
You ain't get a milli, why you sign that?
She wanna fuck, I decline that
Look at my bitch, she a dimebag
Look at my pinky, it's a waterslide
Rich Forever, come and see the money side

Ayy, we can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
Never bring a freak to your spot

How you got a check and went broke again?
Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em
Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em

I flip the money, got my check up
I'm flexing up, but I'm no wrestler
Blue cheese pockets got the extras
I stack the money up like Tetris
How I got two-fifty from my neck up?
How I made it from the hood to a Benz truck?
Bitches wanna fuck, I got them lined up
How you with the gang but you ain't signed up?
Pull out my dick, tell her kiss that
She just want a nigga with a big sack
Pull out the choppa, we in combat
Touchdown on the plug like a lineback

Ayy, we can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
Never bring a freak to your spot
