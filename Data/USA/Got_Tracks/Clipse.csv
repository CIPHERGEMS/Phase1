Pussy,Barbershop 2: Back in Business Soundtrack,2004,"[Hook: Pusha T,

I ain't in to fat lippin, I'm in to gat grippin
A cat's slippin, is a cat drippin
Why I say that? the cat's slippin, the Mac's spittin
The cat drippin, look in the mirror you's a fat kitten
Puuusssssssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy-ah

All I wanted growing up was remote controls
Now my whole life remote control, hit the block dope controlled
Got ghetto corners choking slow
Grandmama go to church trying to soak my soul, oh!
This one's for my foes
Find yourself, in a hopeless hole trying to go against him!
I puppet you Pinocchios, flows on strings
It - is what it seems, just call me Geppetto
A Young Stock Market, put money in your pocket
Cause when Pusha talk it is the object then I drop it
I rose gold ya, huh? pink diamond ya, hah?
Set it in a rhyme now the industry got pink eye
Contagious, flows high demand, like the new Lou Vuitton Monogram
Pastels is cute; How you niggas follow suits so well?
These barrels encompass the heat from hell
Nigga the Franchise of Star Trak sales, uh!

The cat drippin, look in the mirror you's a fat kitten
Puuusssssssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy-ah

They rather see me not breathing, than see me achieve
Have my mama grieving, crouched to her knees
Jealous hearted niggas, y'all wear it on your sleeve
Like a scarlet letter, for the world to see
Can't hide the truth, decendents of Cain
So y'all get exposed like the sons of Hussein
My game way grown, this is known fact
When cats was Ac coupe, I was Cadillac Brougham
I'm not these rap kids, with childish antics
Who make diss records, who rock hat backwards
These are higher stakes, this is not average weight
This is not pinching penniess bitch, this is carrot cake
This is the difference 'tween rookies and the pros
They pattern after me, they cookie-cut my flow
But so (so, so), I'm never one that be jeal'
Do as I do so I can say, ""Papa raised you well""

Puuusssssssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy-ah

They say the Lord closes windows, to open doors
Nigga don't make me open yours
Seen hearts beat through, open sores
Subliminal rap shit, so immature, that's why I ignore
Punchline niggas on front time, silly ho shit
He who questions I is unfocused
Copperfield flow yes! I'll make careers disappear
Like hocus - pocus - no joke, it's Push'

Mercy, mercy! Oh Lord who is he?
Who curse me, curse me? But doing me
It hurts me so, puts me through changes
So I got Porsche's and Hummers to deal wit the anguish (oh, oh!)
Ask Liva, but only if you speak the language
...And the rest is Comic View
Star Trak The Movement, who you pay homage to?
You don't want it with them boys, this I promise you, you pussy!

I’m Serious,Cradle 2 The Grave,2003,"OK, Pusha..minus the T
Niggas is talkin' too blasphemous
Tell me is it these Asscher cuts that got you thinkin'
I'm not in touch with that mask 'n glove
Don't let the Reverend close your casket cause
We think you thinkin'
These verses is curses, the only thing worse is
I'm the ringmaster of the circus
Meanin' that, I'm the only one in the show with purpose
Most of you motherfuckers don't scratch the surface
Look, still ghetto, still tote heavy metal
Still throw a nickname on all of my vehicle
Like the Cooperfield coupe, now you see it now you don't
With one flick of the wrist wow! the roof will go poof! (poof)
I'm an achiever make all of you believers
And I'll be damned if you overthrow Virginia's Caesar
Spend a day, sin away, walk with me
Hug corners in the hood like a ghetto renegade, switch!
Spend a way, rolls gold Jesus
Pink diamonds face flush like it was dunked in pink lemonade
Listen, I'm not actin', this ain't rappin', this live in action
Let's consider all the facts in
I got caught dealin' some weight back when
Now that I'm blown, it's new to men
I know its hurts to see it, but players please believe it

I'm cool with your wishin', don't talk cause I'm listenin'
Fuck 'round and end up missin' if you're curious
No weed or no vodka, my soul will make me pop ya
Don't make me have to milk box ya, I'm serious

See how ya boy do, I pull up in that ride quick
50 on the wrist leanin', niggas is sick
Steamin', they can't understand the meanin'
So they plot and conjure up ways to interrupt my well-bein'
But that 9's been a damn good friend
Trustworthy, made it to see 30 and I owe it all to him
Jewels lookin' as if I done robbed a vault
So if your bitch takes an interest it is not her fault
I mean, look, head to toe heavy in weight
Pockets loaded, hey I must say I take a cake
They speak ill, but words don't break him bone
They bounce off him, cause see him is purchasin' homes
See his stones, how they complement each other?
Size of the rocks and they fluctuate in color
That him is me get a clue enough's enough
Took it easy on y'all fuckers and I ain't even rimed my truck (Uhh)
To put it simple I'm a rarity, ma
From the cars to the jewels what clarity, ha
Stick with me show you life that's out of this world
And I ain't lyin' to you love, I only lie to my girl
I lust for the riches, what a treat this is
The Lord is dealin' with my demons and my weaknesses
God forgive, lose it all or God forbid
But from the Cradle 2 The Grave I'm a live",https://genius.com/Clipse-im-serious-lyrics
Mr. Me Too,Hell Hath No Fury,2006,"You know we back, right?
Clear the streets out
Come on with it, ha-ha
Star Trak

Niggas is haters, I'm doin' deals like the majors
Ice Cream sneakers, I signed my first skater
So you can pay three and buy yourself some Bapestas
Bulletproof under t-shirts because they hate us
Do like Snoop say, step your game up
Double-decker boat nigga, Meditterane' up
D-Class Asscher cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberace fingers, niggas hit Lorraine up
Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin' off the plane, both us laughin'
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Italian heartthrobs could not get rid of me
Up in Donatella crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, ""Gimme that Enzo"" (yessir)
I know what you thinkin', ""Yeah, me too""
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

Been two years like I was paddy wagon cruisin'
The streets was yours, you're dunce cappin' and kazooin'
I was just assumin' you'd keep the coke movin'
But I got one question, fuck y'all been doin'?
Pyrex stirs turned into Cavalli furs
The full length cat, when I wave, the kitty purrs (meow)
All my niggas caked up, sellin' gray and beige dust
Had that money right or end up in the trunk taped up
We don't chase and duck, we only raise the bucks
Peel money rolls 'til our thumbs get the paper cuts
Chill, retardo, South Beach Gallardo
Teals started up, go brrr like it's Nardo
Women, if you love me, please let me know
Tie rags 'round your neck and learn the sets we throw
These are the days of our lives and I'm sorry to the fans
But them crackers weren't playin' fair at Jive

I know, I know, yep, yeah, you too
Okay, we get it, yep, yeah, you too
I know, I know, yep, yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too
I know, I know, yep, yeah, you too
Okay, we get it, yep, yeah, you too
I know, I know, yep, yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

I know what you thinkin' why I call you ""Me Too?""
Cause everythin' I say, I got you sayin', ""Me too""
I say I got a Benz, so you said, ""Me too""
You hangin' out the window so they can see you
But you ain't hangin' out the window when you in that G2
Or that G3 or G4 like we do's
Star Trak, Clipse, Malice, come on

Wanna know the time? Better clock us
Niggas bite the style from the shoes to the watches
We cloud hoppers, tailored suits like we mobsters
Break down keys into dimes and sell them like Gobstoppers
Who gon' stop us? Not a goddamn one of you
Mean with the Re-Up, nigga, we street tumblers
Ivory white, yeah that's the same color
Of the 'Zure, nigga, best believe it's the Mulliner
Take no prisoners, rap niggas are whisperers
Choke on your own spit just as soon as you mention us
Champagne corks and kicks by Louis sports and
Keep my hoes in Pucc' and Charles Jourdan, uh!
Cop it, chrome it, touch-screen component
Mink on the floor, make you hot, don't it?
You don't wanna know what the fuck I spent on it
Tomorrow ain't promised so we live for the moment

I know, I know, yep, yeah, you too
Okay, we get it, yep, yeah, you too
I know, I know, yep, yeah, you too
Okay, everybody meet Mr. Me Too

Who gon' stop us? Fuck the coppers, the mind of a kilo shopper
Seeing my life through the windshields of choppers
I ain't spend one rap dollar in three years, holla!
Money's the leash, drag a bitch by her dog collar
Now ho follow
This is my ghetto story like Cham, Ice-P is the 
Don Dada
Open the Frigidaire, 25 to life in here
So much white you might think your holy Christ is near
Throw on your Louis V millionaires to kill the glare
Ice trays? Nada! All you'll see is pigeons paired
The realest shit I ever wrote
Not Pac inspired, it's crack pot inspired,
 my real niggas quote
Bitch never cook my coke, why?
Never trust a whore with your child
At you make believe rappers, I smile, ha! Canal Streeting my style
Like you internet sharing my files, you MySpace niggas
So kill the comparison, I'm South Beach sipping on Sarafin
Royalty check nigga, I never been
Coke money clean through Merrill Lynch
Accountant just gasp at the smell of it! (

Keys in the floor, mistress in Dior
Bitch tell me she love me but I know she's a whore
Shit could get ugly, shit, she talk to the law
And that's just what I get, it's the Roses of War
Fuck the Bureau, rather be spending Euros
And get fed grapes, fuck hoes in plurals
Just like heaven as I gaze at the mural
What a peace of mind when you cop you some Shapiros
Cheers to the future as we toast to life
I'm Prive-ing in Miami, I'm a socialite, nigga
The cars are big, the cribs are bigger
The kids are happy, the perfect picture
Gemstar razor, the fruit of my labor
And I walk with a glow, it's like the Lord's shown favor

You know, Broadway, daddy
Manteca, crack, hooray
Toda la vaina que hay aqui arriba
En Uptown baby, otra vez (
G-g-got it for cheap
)
Clipse, ""Hell Hath No Fury"", B
Let 'em know, daddy, Mr. Lee! Haha!

Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him (Got it for cheap)
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, I German engineer 'em
No serum can cure, all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to selling it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's selling it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm more in touch with the keys, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yo-yo
Bouncing like a pogo
, 
they praying I never go solo

G-g-got it for cheap
Do it! (

I fuck with the real niggas, daddy (

G-g-got it for cheap, g-g-got it for cheap
Fucking envidioso, bunch of palomos
G-g-got it, got it, got it, got it

The wool's removed and now I see
My leg was pulled, the joke's on me
So heartbreakin, like lovin a whore
Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it? The shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last, not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never

G-g-got it for cheap
Ay, dios mío! Malicioso! (
Got it for cheap

The handcuffs are off now, daddy
Got it, got it for cheap, g-g-got it for cheap
Entiende, cabroncito (

I'm the best since he died, and he lied
The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad
CPR Pusha, the flow tends to revive
Pullin the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A 4'11"" Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity, the fury was born

Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggas just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma, look at me, I'm turnin the other cheek
It's the R-E-U-P G-A-N-G

G-g-got it for cheap
From the street to this música (
Got it for cheap

We get this money, we never stop (
Got it, got it for cheap

Young'un, don't make my sails rise (Ugh)
I shoot you out your Chukkas

Papa said, ""Stay free of them suckers""
Minus the wicked jumper, street baller like the Rucker
Skip to my Lou if you lookin for a couple
, roosters in the duffle
Keep the hood screaming, ""Cock-a-doodle doo, fuckers""
Coke by the ton, rap niggas, I'm the one
With basic rhyme pattern, how the fuck you tryna chatter?
ASIC ass rappers, got 'em runnin' for they life
I philosophize about Glocks and keys
Niggas call me Young Black Socrates
West Indies bitch drop to knees quick (What?)
With dreams of being a rich man's bitch
Feel sorry for niggas, pull triggers, and they shit click
So many bullets jammed in my shit, call me Lead Fist
Shake the diamonds out my wrists

Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious

Youngin', learn from me, let's not be at odds
We're more like than not, 2 peas of a pod
Same hustle, 'cept my hustle now flows
I once gave it away, at 30 grams a O
That accounts for all them days in the cold
Feels like kids and cake mix, can't wait to lick the bowl
But it's a bigger picture, homes, trust I done seen it
From Frankfurt to Cologne, Oslo to Sweden
From Italy's Milan to the shores of Napoli
Now I consider Ferrari and Salvador Dalis
I'm no longer local, my thoughts are global
That's why I seem distant, son, expand ya vision
Even adored by Norwegian woman
Blonde hair and blue eyes, I'm gettin' back with a vengeance
Whip it like they want me all attached to the kitten
And they wonder in these raps if I'm kiddin', huh

Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Big home, palm trees and watches
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
My only accomplice is my conscience, uh

""Miami Vice""
Sorry Heavenly Father, once again I hate to bother
It's P, the evil creeper, send some to the Grim Reaper
Meanwhile, me and my missus like Solomon and Sheba
Sign of the times, her Emilio Pucci sneakers, uh
Ghetto literature, I'd damn near die for Bolivia
It don't take much to get rid of ya
Once I send for ya, better call the minister, ugh!

I'm sorry, Grandmama, for mistakes I have made
When I aired family business, how you put me in my place
Even my baby mama, I can't look you in the face
Cause I can't do enough, you a symbol of God's grace
So I place you in the flowerbed, porcelain shower heads
Throughout the house and keep the youngins' mouths fed
And when I'm gone, I hope it is said
I gave structure to the youth by the example I led, uh

Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
I don't fear Tubbs & Crockett
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious
Got two hot rocks in my pocket
Mama I'm so sorry, I'm so obnoxious

Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuck wagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Ugh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snowman, call me Frosty Lover

This for the 100,000 dollar kitty German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fucking with college bitches with innocent looks like Mýa
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars, I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floorboard
Enough to start World War
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches
Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, shit 'bout long as Jesus'
Hostilely speaks the Gospel, so match this
Pusha push John P. keys with these sounds of crackness, ugh!
The Black Martha Stewart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches, ugh
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

Life's a circus, I parade the 6 through these clowns
The crown is vacant, I'm taking the proper steps
I'm takin' them Poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling, the king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Franck Muller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, laying over dark skin
Looking like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish where the sharks a-swim
In that opaque linen with the odd-colored stitching
V12 on the Modena, you can see the pistons
HREs on it, mami, see it glisten
When I (*vrrroom*) make all of her twist like Dickens
It's feeling like parts is missing, top stole, push soul
Gotta drive it like pole position 'til my soul is risen

And the three behind mine (Ugh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snowman, call me Frosty Lover

Welcome to the world of Rollies
VS diamonds and that 50,000 dollar show piece, got me shinin'
First nigga holler, ""Show me""?
Let that 9 millimeter turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fucking faggot, you need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome—chrome rims with stallion insignia
Listen, young'un: you've only just begun
""You'll understand when you're older,"" said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs; slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousel of horses with dual-exhaustion, 'fess up
Young'un, you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch-up, nigga

All I want to do is ride around shining while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuck wagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Ugh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snowman, call me Frosty Lover",https://genius.com/Clipse-ride-around-shining-lyrics
Nightmares,Hell Hath No Fury,2006,"I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid

I'm waking up in the middle of the night
My heartbeat's pumpin' like something ain't right
Oh, what's goin' on?
When I go outside, I feel something behind me
I'm looking back, but nothin's around me
(Oh, what's goin' on?) Man, I don't know
What am I trippin' on?
There's something in the room (There's something in the room)
It's lurkin' in the shadows (Lurkin' in the shadows)
Staring through the darkness (Ohhh)
Man I don't know
These four walls are closing in (Closing in)
These voices ain't my friend
They hauntin' me
Those, those memories

I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid

Yeah, they comin' for me, they runnin' up
I'm on my balcony, seeing through the eyes of Tony
They say we homies, but I see hatred
Do not they know brotherly love is sacred?
Niggas catch feelin's, even contemplate killin's
When you see millions, there are many chameleons
You're not a gunna for real, you're just a runner
Haters, I spot you from afar and I'm the deer hunter
They be thinkin' nice car, nice crib
I be thinkin' how long will these niggas let me live
I understand, cause people need things
And they will take it from you and take you from your seedlings
So even when the mumblers talk
I still walk the most humblest walk
And one day, they may even catch up with me man
But 'til then, I'm Leonardo, catch me if you can, uh!

I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid

Look over your shoulder, something is near
And I'm so scared; when I'm alone, I'm so scared
Now it's inching closer, trouble is near
But nothing's there; when I look, nothing's there
I'm outta my mind, I'm runnin' from guilt, but
It's right by my side, there's nowhere to hide, oh
I'm outta my mind, I'm runnin' from guilt, but
It's right by my side, there's nowhere to hide, oh

I make big money, drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
Virginia nights
, 
sellin hard white
To sellin' out shows, every gangsta love my flow
Still I creep low, thinking niggas tryna harm me
Hoping my karma ain't coming back here to haunt me
Was it that nigga? I took his powder with a smile
Pray to the Lord, the gun ain't pop and hit the child, shit
I pilt niggas' girls back
 like 
alpha-hydroxy
Spent money like ""Happy Days"", I'm the real Fonzie
Top off the coupe, that's how JFK got shot,
 B
Can't let niggas roll up beside me, and 2Pac me
Holla if you hear me, tears flowing sincerely
Check up on my block weekly, my health yearly
Something's wrong with me, niggas don't get along with me
Got a fo-fo, hope your body got strong kidneys, oh!

I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid
I'm having nightmares, ooooh
My niggas say I'm p-noid
They say I'm just p-noid",https://genius.com/Clipse-nightmares-lyrics
Hello New World,Hell Hath No Fury,2006,"Straight crushing you

Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, ""We on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, ""I'm on my way!""
Yes I rap but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi, screaming, ""It's on its way!""
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Look out world, I'm on my way""

I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the Hyatt though
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Ohh!)
At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fucking plenty bitches while ducking a baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
""Say yes!""
 
Niggas hear the ""yuugh!"" and they know it's me
Make 'em sick to their stomach how they s'posed to be
Sipping on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where its s'posed to be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm s'posed to be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning

Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, ""We on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, ""I'm on my way!""
Yes I rap but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi, screaming, ""It's on its way!""
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Look out world, I'm on my way""

This goes out to my A-alikes that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nikes, live a hustler's way of life
In white tees, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumping that D arm readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin, stay lookin over they shoulders
Holdin them boulders, tryin to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at 'cha, quote-unquote ""famous rapper""
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live
But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must, be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, six gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
Cause the judge is saying ""Life"" like it ain't someone's life

Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, ""We on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, ""I'm on my way!""
Yes I rap but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi, screaming, ""It's on its way!""
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Look out world, I'm on my way""

Yo, what up, what up
This is ya man Grimey from downtown Norfolk
Just want y'all to know it's about time for us to come up and make a change, man
They keep tryna keep us down, but that ain't the way to be, man
It's about time for us to get it together, man
Everybody else put they shit together
Why the niggas can't get together, put they money together?
Hustlers come together with hustlers, know what I'm saying?
This ain't just for the playas in VA
This for playas all over the world, this is Grimey

Time's a-wasting, niggas doin so much hatin
Free ya heart and show ya greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin my patience
Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggas rise up! Get that money
Put them 9's up
Piggy-back out the ghetto ‘for times up! Niggas rush!

Hello new world, here we come on them Twinkie trains
With the hood screaming, ""We on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screaming, ""I'm on my way!""
Yes I rap but best believe

Chinese New Year,Hell Hath No Fury,2006,"I'm at your door, your eyes are like, ""Why are you here?""
Judging by my steel, I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year
Blatt! Blatt! Blatt! Blatt!
Blatt! Blatt! Ca-ca-ca-ca!
Blatt! Blatt! Blatt! Blatt!
Blatt! Blatt! Ca-ca-ca-ca!

Mask on face, Glock in hand
I was in and out of homes like the Orkin Man
Never listen to my parents like an orphan man
Strong finger on the trigger like it's in dwarf's hands
Confiscate goodies like Repo Man Sam
Make nigga kick that can
Fall victim to the Klick Klack Klan
My vixen eat ya face like she Ms. Pac-Man
My wish her command, ugh, ADT's ain't stop me
Simple like ABC's
Snip, cut, yank just as easy as 1-2-3
Breaking and entry so elementary
Get what the hustlers get for tryna do what the hustlers do
Give up the cash 'fore I turn you Cookie Monster blue
And your man and them for tryna be hustlers too
Ernie and Bert, I bet them bullet holes burning and hurt, uh

I'm at your door, your eyes are like, ""Why are you here?""
Judging by my steel, I got something to do here

Let's play cops and robbers
And watch Heckler & Koch turn cops to martyrs
As well as niggas with plots to rob us
Try me, I'll turn this motherfucker into ""Shottas""
With them 911's revvin'
Gunfire leave brethren remains like it's 9/11
And get the sounds of rounds dispensing
That clack up make 'em back up like it's invisible fencing
When I picture bits and pieces
Of bone chip and flesh, it tears me to pieces
Cooperate, escape is useless
Trust me, I'm your friend, I will talk you through this
Trick or treat niggas with hoods want the goods
I feel like Robin Hood when I share it with my hoods
Don't forget, he who plays hero gets hit
Don't let the 9 mil' riddle your wits, smarty pants

I'm at your door, your eyes are like, ""Why are you here?""
Judging by my steel, I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears
Front of your crib sounding like Chinese New Year
Blatt! Blatt! Blatt! Blatt!
Blatt! Blatt! Ca-ca-ca-ca!
Blatt! Blatt! Blatt! Blatt!
Blatt! Blatt! Ca-ca-ca-ca!

Sympathy? I feel none, when you hear that humming
Common sense'll tell you duck and get the fuck outta harm's way
You dying will absolutely make my day
Why he had to go look cool? But he wasn't so he got betrayed
This is what I did to him, nozzle with a Sig to him
Hurried out his crib, before that took everything
Powder to pocket change, even the lint
Left the boy laying with his skin
If I didn't get you right, you better hold your pistol tight
When we meet in the afterlife, Coldchain on the block when it bleed
Rosco P, young G, I don't speak, I just squeeze
97 P will make you drop to your knees
Before you know it you'll be floating to a better place, your soul feeling free
I'm young, black and I just don't give a fuck
Big burner on my waist, drugs in the trunk
Sitting high in a truck, call me luck, come press me

I'm at your door, your eyes are like, ""Why are you here?""
Judging by my steel, I got something to do here
Give up the money or the angel cries two tears

On the chest of a biz-oss, it's a must I fliz-oss
My dream team wrestle for cheese like Eric Bischoff
From the kickoff to tip off
I give off rays from the VVs

Thinking they can see me, I beg to diff-arr
Look up in the skiz-eye, it the Big Dip-arr

Meanwhile, study something nigga, this Gucci, Parker
From France where the kids sing Frere Jacques
If not there, I'm somewhere mixing vodkas
In a far off land, where they shake maracas and shit

Still slingin' that P-I, E what I bring by

Still hugging that corner so tight it can't breathe, I
Never let it go cause a nigga gotta eat, I
Came to conquer the game, the flame and the powder
And the pot, stirred it crazy, hustle I'm a lead-a

Love for foreign cars would explain my Carrera
Who cares when these fools talk?
Don't mean jack 'til that tool gotta talk
Icy wrists help me to cool off
And the second hand on this bitch, it moonwalk
Reminds me of how I applied myself
And why I now ride with Tiptronic help

In me getting robbed, well follow ya heart
And I'll waste ya, hell, I raised ya

Rarely do I toot my own horn

Pulling up on your grill, I'm so trill

Of Pharrell, from The Neptunes
And I just wanna let y'all know (I'm yo' pusha)
The world, is about to feel something (I'm yo pusha)
That they've never felt before, c'mon

From ghetto to ghetto, to backyard to yard
I sell it whipped un-whipped, it’s soft or hard
I'm the, neighborhood pusha
Call me Subwoofer, cause I pump base like that, Jack
On or off the track, I'm heavy cuz
Ball 'til you fall cause you could duck to the Feddy Govs
Sorry my love, what I'm seeing through these eyes
Benz convoys with the wagon on the side
Only big boys keep deuces on the ride
Gucci Chuck Taylor with the dragon on the side
Man, I make a buck, why scram?
I'm tryna show y'all who the fuck I am
The jewels is flirting, be damned if I'm hurting
Legend in two games like I'm Pee Wee Kirkland
Platinum on the block with consistent hits
While Pharrell keep talking this music shit

Patty cake, patty cake, I'm the baker's man
I bake them cakes as fast as I can
And you can tell by how my bread stack up
Then disguise it as rap so the Feds back up
Watch it, like my whip, like my chick topless
Doing a buck-six with me in the cockpit
Grindin' cousin, I got wholes for a dozen
Even 11-5 if I see ya keep it comin'
And my weight, that's just as heavy as my name
So much dough, I can't swear I won't change
Excuse me if my wealth got me full of myself
Cocky, something that I just can't help
'Specially when them 20's is spinning like windmills
And the ice 32 below minus the wind chill
Filthy, the word that best defines me
I'm just grinding man, y'all never mind me

My grind's 'bout family, never been about fame
From days I wasn't able, there was always 'caine
Four and a half will get you in the game
Anything less is just a goddamn shame
Guess the weight, my watch got blue chips in the face
Glock with two tips whoever gets in the way
Not to mention the hideaway that rests by the lake
Consider my raw demeanor the icing on the cake
I'm grindin'

I move 'caine like a cripple
Balance weight through the hood, kids call me Mr. Sniffles
Other hand on my nickel
Plated whistle, one eye closed, I'll hit you
As if I was Slick Rick, my aim is still an issue
Lose your soul in, whichever palm I'm holdin'

You ready to come down here?
It's Virginia, nigga
We do this in broad daylight
It's a whole different degree of homicide, nigga
You ready?

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (
talkin' 'bout what?

Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (
talkin' 'bout what?
)
Where we re-up, re-locate, we off them rooks (
talkin' 'bout what?

So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (
talkin' 'bout what?

In my home sweet home, 
I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin'
, since I love the feel
I guess I'm passionately pimpin', it 'tis what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seam of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through the streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny, out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme
Got semis waitin', heat like Caribbean summers
I been there, each year, a diffferent bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under, Push' or Mal'
, Gonz or Grimes
With me, 
with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at that Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild, but what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like OJ
Beat murder like the shit is okay, that's what our dough say
Talk the evil that men do, I'm lost in the mental
I miss you Shampoo, we miss you Shampoo
And your grams too...

Seem like they all got a comment to make
In regards to my paper, now they guessin' my weight
They fast to predict the outcome of my fate
Wonderin' 'bout Clipse and if they got what it take
""Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit""
You right on both counts, bitch, Clipse is us
And there are some things that you don't discuss
Don't ask me 'bout the Neptunes and what's they fare
Don't ask about the loud screamin' chick with the hair
Don't ask about my music, and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly
Now face down, layin' on your tummy or you die
I tried being humble, humble get no respect
Now the first sign of trouble, that's a hole up in your neck
Plus what I look like spendin' my nights in jail?
I could never be a thug, they don't dress this well
I reside in VA, ride in VA
Most likely when I die, I'm gon' die in VA
Virginia's for lovers, but trust there's hate here
For out-of-towners, who think that they gon' move weight here
Ironic, the same same place I'm makin' figures at
That there's the same land they used to hang niggas at, in Virginia

Clipse, The Neptunes (Get down!)
And the new label (Get, get down!)
(Get down!) Star Trak!

Top down, chrome spinning
You see the boss grinning, I'm loving these damn women
I let two get in, she tried to let the rest fit in
I'm like, ""Naw love, that's forbidden""
I ain't for squishing, that's a problem to the wheel well
Trust I know them 20's real well
Now we coasting, me, two chicks and toasting
I turn up the volume, watch the bass get 'em open
Soft spoken, with a wild side
I love 'em in the ride, they lovin' the ride
We was moving bodies before we hit the party
Before the DJ started cutting (I was already fucking)
Cinderella'd you girls; from nothing to something
Hit the parking lot, hear the club system thumping
Lose the face, you two's was great
But it's to the V.I.P., I got new moves to make

Smoke something, drink something, get ripped
And make the girls in the party just strip
Move ya ass, girl (Get, get down!)

How many chicks can you fit in that ride?
Put 'em up, homie (Get, get down!)

Hey, it's just a day in the life
Club nights, one of the reasons I love life
Chicks be in the back tipsy
We gets in for free—""Ay, they with me""
Two stepping, you see each crew repping
Slipping on the floor, mirrors and walls is sweating
Shorty in my ear say she got a thong on
And I love how she move any time a song on
I like that ma, you do something to me
Come this way and prove something to me
Fast or slow, she got the right moves
And I got the right dough for any date that I choose
I'm open, but naw, I don't lose focus
If the shit jump off, you know the thing that I'm toting
But I'm only here to party, y'all
Carry every weekend like it's Mardi Gras

Smoke something, drink something, get ripped

Put 'em up, homie (Get, get down!)

Yo, you are now listening to the sounds
That are vibrating your speakers
Please do not be alarmed (Get, get down!)
It will not hurt you at all
For it is the real
For all my real niggas and bitches (Get, get!)

When they say, ""Last call"", it don't mean the night's over
It mean it's time for her to show ya
How quick she can hop out those Gucci loafers
Pin her ass to the sofa and attack the chocha
S&M chick, asked Pusha to choke her
But I thought about how rich I am and said, ""No sir""
Chick was crazy, gave her crazy space
What did it? The whip appeal or my baby face?

The night's still young and I'm already leaning
Cruise through the lot on the deuce-two's gleaming
The liquor in me and I don't need a reason
Obnoxious with the women, hot tucked in the linen
I pull up, let her get in, she know from the beginning
She added to the list of them chicks that I done been in
Her head spinning and my head spinning
Mine from juice and gin and hers from neck and chin and
I'm a winner, man

I’m Not You,Lord Willin’,2002,"No, no, no!
I told you, I lived this shit
I ain't up here just rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit
Naw, uh-uh, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you, rapper
I'm not you, Pusha

I keep that ziploc bustin at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow to ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Prolly think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots, A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clown?
 Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, ""Wow, that didn't look like my man""
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin
Half static and face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and, I didn't give em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on em, pressed the 40 up on him shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
The coffin the cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain ""Super Nigga,"" I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men

Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest, no sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down, any place I step
And I love getting slept on, cause I'm rawer than dope
Fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor?
You wouldn't understand, cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if (come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, ""No, I move coke"" (uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen them pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (so sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit
And that's how I know that I ain't shit (I ain't shit)
My heart bleed but that's aside from the fact
I live for my kids and theirs and them youngins after that",https://genius.com/Clipse-im-not-you-lyrics
Intro,Lord Willin’,2002,"Playas we ain't the same, I'm into 'caine and guns
Chopard with the fishes make the face lift numb
Out in Panama in that amazing sun; I'm amazing, son
You niggas wonder where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw Crockett & Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big when they televised that raw
My mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down the stairs too quick hummin'
""Miami Vice"" theme music, Calderone made me colder
I see the villain's impact, now that I'm older
Ignorant fool, views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money, keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session they handed out the rules
So I gravitated, related to life's cruels
The meaning? Pusha T's more than he's seeming
Not just a rap name, more so like a damn shame
Nothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap and I ain't lost my past
Shit could get hairy, I could lose myself in a flash
Niggas'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that mask

I even went by the book at first
Until I realized 9 to 5 wouldn't quench my thirst
So I start my mission, leave my residence
Mama knew that a child like me had better sense
But something had to give, that's real, I had to live
I chefed that soft white and pumped from her crib
Scout's honor, started with my grandmama
Who distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner please, I grinds, I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate surrounding the street
If I was you, I'd be tryna get down with me
But no, see these niggas know too much
Meanwhile I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak many times back to back
And still feel belittled sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown ass rappers who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it however they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MCs no longer your favorite
Hey, I'm one of the greats, I can't lie
I mean great to the point I'm concerned I might die
Make no mistake, Malice is who you tuned to
It's all in the name, trust, I will wound you",https://genius.com/Clipse-intro-lyrics

Unapproachable appearance to how I pack the ninas
Out of two Clipse, they say Malice the meanest
Got love for guns and caine, let nothin' come between us
You mistook me for a rapper, huh?
Well that makes me an actor, cause I would rather clap a gun
And buck on them niggas who hate
Who wanna be in my shoes? Live my life but can't carry my weight
I understand that the envy is part of the game
But make no mistake, you and I, we are not the same
Naw bitch, I'm liable to splatter ya shit
Light up ya world 'til you start to stagger and shit
Watch how them hollows straight rattle ya shit
And I leave it to y'all to freestyle and battle and shit
That's not me, I'm more at home with the chrome
Or at play wit the yay, moving 12 for a zone, I'm gone

Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money

God damn, when that white hits the pan and
Comes back hard, I can account for every gram and
The streets molded the man I am
The pimp, the hustler, the crook, the killer, gorilla
Traits of a blow dealer, cost my fame
I hustle, I'm rich, blow scrilla
, 
I'm the torch that, carry the game
The flame I throw
, 
crack change came from blow
Push the O's, six lay close
Hug the streets, I hug the beat, change flows
Thug the streets, my love is deep, my pain shows
My heart's on a sleeve-a
Nigga that they gave they soul and hearts to mistreat you
Nigga told they breaking my heart on the streets so
Watch the phonies, watch ya homies, we pop-pop, drop you homie

[Verse 3: Pusha T & 
Pharrell

They call me Pusha for one reason
Cause I keep that sniff all seasons
Whether the price is up or down
I keep a mound to pitch from, you don't have to shop around
When it come to that money, I get stealth
Three guns is fortune, and I don't mind sharing my wealth
Dawg, I know about life
I been around the world thrice times, I mean what I say
From that Panama sun to France's Champs-Élysées
Grind so deep-rooted, I can't turn away
To sell base is now somewhat therapeutic
Hear what I say, please don't confuse it
My verses heal, like Curt Mayfield's music
(
I'm your pusha!
) Damn right
, I treat ya nose to hook ya
And only pull back to cook ya, partner

Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money

I be damned if I die of starvation, things is fucked up as is
So I bangs my cabbage; do you not know the most effective
Way of gettin' money? Pull yo gun rapidly
And watch you see the situation be corrected
Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish
They say whatcha do comes back on you two times
I shoulda been died, but I'm still walking around with two nines
Who wants to be a millionaire? Me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
Cause every move you make, I'ma throw a slug
And hope you choke blood, nigga, on every breath you take
Not to be broke, cause Coldchain's fate witness
Naturally spitting from me, human gat, field to the limit
Head to diminish, loud niggas talking gibberish
Grind beef, I deliver it with complimentary service
For certain, live in the living room, searching to hurting you

Cot damn!
It's a new day
Cot damn!
But that nigga wanted money
Hoooo, uh, hoooo, uh
Hoooo, uh, cot damn!

Dear Diary, here I am once again writing to you 'bout this bitch-ass nigga
You know I was fuckin' with him an' all that
Supposed to be a creep thang
I understood about his bitch aight, I accepted her
But then he gon' come with this bullshit
You know I thought I had time invested in this motherfucker
He gon' tell me, you know, ""Things need to change a lil bit
We need to slow down a lil bit""
Slow down for what?! Not for that bitch!
I know you not tryna slow down with me for that motherfucking raggedy ass bitch
Yo girl this, yo girl that
Your girl is a motherfucking fake wearing all that fake ass shit
She buying out of somebody else's motherfucking truck
See, one thing 'bout me I'm an authentic bitch
I put yo' motherfucking ass on it
You still buy her fake motherfucking shit
Her and that teeny lil ass motherfucking car
You gon' throw some cheap ass twenty dollar rims on that motherfucker
You think you got some motherfucking bag?
Bitch you ain't got no motherfucking bag
I showed you the motherfucking ropes
I showed you how to motherfucking dress with that lil bit of money
That you had at that point in motherfucking time
I drained yo' motherfucking ass
I drained yo' motherfucking ass broke
And here you gon' riding round in a '95 car tryna get a 2002 bitch motherfucker",https://genius.com/Clipse-cot-damn-lyrics
Comedy Central,Lord Willin’,2002,"Say dawg, let's not get involved
You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome 4 that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen:
""Good night friend, 'til we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again""
Uh, I never front like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend, if they could, they'd kill me, friend
Cause I weigh too much, 
learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on

They call me Mr. Please-Believe-It, believe it please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease
This guy's in a hurry
Ma, I can't even fuck with you if you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying their jewelry
Why's your ice cream, like it's made by Ben & Jerry?
Y'all the type of players that be getting two-day contracts
E-mail snitch got Ds in your two-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans with the deuce trey on back
The Street Family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July and we had on Woolrich's
I got them teflons, to shove in the 4
That have undercovers and po', recovering slow
The government know, the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow
Ghetto

I keep the streets so numb they call me ""Novocaine""
I turn over 'caine, over and over again
Hell, so much clientele
I could lose it all today, be back the next day
Still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures: down, up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime: snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask him, Pusha T, Pusha-Ton
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run
Yes I'm holding, whether it's heat or coke in
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
It's money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Mine's mental, others is made up stencil
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in a rental
I'm livid, they act as if I don't live it

Young Boy,Lord Willin’,2002,"You're out of line!
Mmm, I'll tell you what I'm talkin 'bout
You're out of line!
When I was a young boy
You're out of line!
My momma always told me don't take no shit
You're out of line!
Motherfucker hit you then you better hit 'em back
You're out of line!
So when I hit the nigga, it go ""blam!"", uh
(
You're out of line!
) A nigga out of line, uh

Back when I was 'bout Big Wheels and race tracks
Pops pushed a Tornado and rolled to eight tracks
Never stood a chance, exposed from way back
Lying to the baby, saying its Ajax
I was 'bout four when I walked past that door
That shoulda been closed where I first witnessed the raw
See in my household it was quite unique
Playing hide and seek you might find a key
Caught glimpse accidental, it branded my mental
Pals my role model in that 
Lincoln Continental
Bought all my friends Icees, it was 'bout six
And when he pulled off I was like, ""See told ya we was rich.""
How I turned out, let it be no surprise
When they speak of cousin Ricky it brings tears to their eyes
See, my family got a history of hustlers
Lil' brother, 
big brother,
 mother to grandmother
It's tradition

Mmm, I'll tell you what I'm talkin 'bout
You're out of line!
When I was a young boy
You're out of line!
My momma always told me don't take no shit
You're out of line!

(
You're out of line!
) A nigga out of line, I said
(
You're out of line!
) Motherfuckers out of line

My momma didn't see it coming, my daddy was there
What's my excuse? Cartoons were the root
Started with Yosemite Sam with the gun in
Palm of each hand, what couldn't I demand?
See, thirteen, studied the gangsta's lean
Low brim, no smile, lot of cash, meanwhile
Daddy had the Chrysler Fifth Avey
Hustlers on the blocks cars were aero-dynamie
With ghetto paint jobs, Mango M3s
Seventeen inch BBs riding tough
The bike was Huffy,
 attention was froze
In a twenty-five cent frozen cup laid my soul
The streets had made the mold
Since fourteen holding, Pusha T was chosen
Rebel like Che Guevara
RC Tyco versus Carrera, it's P

Mmm, I'll tell you what I'm talkin 'bout
You're out of line!
When I was a young boy
You're out of line!

So when I hit the nigga, it go ""blam!"", uh
(
You're out of line!
) A nigga out of line, I said
(
You're out of line!
) Motherfuckers outta line

I think of grandma and the weight she would foot 'em
She kinda remind me of Madame Queen in ""Hoodlum""
Sport the grandkids, each one she would treasure
Said she kept two guns and to do so was a pleasure
The cigarette dangle forty-five degree angle
Still every bit a lady but you don't wanna tangle
Let that explain me and how I got involved
Young'ns hustling in the Creek, me, Jon-Jon and Jamal

Age fifteen, walking through the hallway
Plate the new Jordans, first ones on the scene
See I could afford 'em, living out a dream
Hustler on the rise, laces untied
Slid past young'ns, couldn't break my stride
Didn't know I was knotted in street ties
Teachers askin' how and why
Bitches passing by, ""Oh my, he's so gangsta""

Mmm, I'll tell you what I'm talkin 'bout
You're out of line!
When I was a young boy
You're out of line!
My momma always told me don't take no shit

Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Gimme somethin' to roll
Somethin' gangstafied
Hey, hey, Star Trak, Star Trak
Now let's smoke and ride

Oh girl ya taste is
Sweet like mornin' dew
I would go crazy girl
If I couldn't have none of you
I said ya from Jamaica
Straight outta my Mercedes trunk
You make me wanna roll ya up
And then you make my body slump

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

I only love her on occasions
Keep my heart racin', 
love to take her on vacations
Where the time zone changes and money exchanges
The speed is in kilometers on the dials of the ranges
Far away
With my Jamaican sexy, every day is like a holiday
The cheeba got me in a slum sleeper
But when I try to leave her, I just find out that it's cheaper to keep her
Plus she keep my thoughts deeper, really zonin'
Like my Cali homies 6-4 rollin'
Or them Detroit 'Lacs trimmed and golden
Or my Texas family 150 wires strollin'
Damn, I was caught up in the Matrix
But not Keanu Reeves, as she rolls in bamboo leaves
I think of ways to ship off these piano keys
Since the trappin' is gangsta lean

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

Look, you put me where I need to be, twist you anytime I feel the need
Love ya touch and how you set my mind at ease
In Virginia where you kept me motionless
From that point on, I knew I could never get over this
Now they wanna see us broke up
Cause I'm lovesick, got me all choked up
Look, you keep my head in the clouds mami 'til I can't breathe
And next to that heat seeker you my main squeeze
Plus I get twistin' didn't even spend my money on
Now either I'm a fool or you really must got me gone
You got me open these days I must admit
Body numbed up and in a slump like I've been hit
But luckily it's just the green got me leavin' smoke streams
And blowin' smoke rings as I flee from the scene
Gangsta leanin' in a 850 beamin'
I'm like K-Ci and Jo-Jo, love you got me fiendin'

Oh girl ya taste is
Sweet like mornin' dew
I would go crazy girl
If I couldn't have none of you
I said ya from Jamaica
Straight outta my Mercedes trunk
You make me wanna roll ya up
And then you make my body slump

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean

You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
Make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)
You make a nigga have a gangsta lean
(Talk about the gangsta lean)

Her sex so sticky, I'm talkin' real icky
Have me gone and twisty, make my other women miss me
Just by the way she kiss me
Hold her with the index and thumb tippys, ma, I'm so trippy
Hard to hold back, scent so sweet
Got to Cognac and honey wrap her this ain't drink
From Taiwanese to Amsterdam greeny green
To hydroponic that make a weak stomach vomit

Listen, at times you hinder my vision
Blinded by ya love and you got the room spinnin'
It's not jealousy the reason why I keep you hidden
Hell, I hit you then I pass you to my man like I do my women
I know just what I'm investin' in
I done traded currency with the Mexicans
In Texas just so we could get affectionate
Your complexion lime green with red specks in it
I love you

Which make a nigga have a gangsta lean

C'mon, I wanna love you girl
Just wanna love you girl
Let me love you girl
Let me...

When we met, I was talkin' that game, parkin' that thang
Since then between us, a lot of things changed
Now it's like the world got a whole different name
I can't stop chicks from sayin' my name
Most of it's lies, if not, don't be surprised
You knew I was ballin' when I met you
But really, I started layin' low just to net you
I'm raw as hell yet can't deny that you special
These girls can't either, winter, his and her Vivas
Summer, his and her Louie sneakers
You don't think that bother people?
Guess again, you even need to check your friends
Sayin' that I cheat
, right, maybe with my heat
Got a pearl handled chrome thing that I call Sweets
I greet with her, creep with her, even eat with her
Late nights under my sheets, yeah, I sleep with her
But thats it

Look, ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryna split up us lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit? (
No
)
You see me sendin' her on trips and shit? (
No
)
If the answers no, don't forget (
How's she know you then?
)
I don't know

If I don't know I don't know, let's not go that road
I don't know who she is, don't care who told
Look, stop flippin', no need to explode
I seen the number in the pager, I don't know that code
In the streets too much? C'mon, that's absurd
Gettin' no complaints when I be flippin' them birds
Your girls just talk 'bout this, that and the third
Believe half what you see, none of what you heard
You askin' me who's her, I'm askin' who's mink fur
With that rock on her hand makin' their eyes blurred
Could that be you plus who cop every gem?
Who spend like I spend? Then act like it then
Got the dream home and we settled in it
Our lives too perfect, that's why they meddle in it
Now, just chalk it up as just part of the game
You know who I'm about, who got part of my name?

Look, ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryna split up us lovebirds
But that's not it
Now you see me buyin' her whips and shit? (

I'm not most men, my heart truer than theirs
Of course your girls hate, our whips newer than theirs
We hardly fight, arguements way fewer than theirs
Even down to the ice, look, bluer than theirs
What they gon' tell us about us, huh?
What they gon' talk 'bout without us, huh?
The envy got 'em speakin loosely
Tell 'em walk in your shoes but first let 'em know they Gucci

And even if I did twist her, I promise I didn't kiss her
Wasn't shit touchy feely
Grudge on the floor like Mister did to Celie, no respect shown
My homies laugh while she talk dirty on the speaker phone
Now don't you start, I spared your heart
If you ain't see it, I didn't do it
, ain't I played my part?
Bricks, chicks, whips, chips, that just go with the grind
What else do you want from me? To say it? Fine

Look, ma, I don't love her
Don't listen to her words
She tryna split up us lovebirds

Rapper or a hustler, who rocks is bigger?

With the B-12, I make that straight killa
I flood the block,
 
I hug the Glock
I have a whole neighborhood asking a thug to stop (
Stop!

Cause I show 'em what Waco see
Then hit the district, pay a visit to Jac-O-B
I like my diamonds colored, watch is smothered (
Me too
)
Show off at the place of jewels, let the white man love it (

I'm too much, got bitches out for me
Bring 'em home, give 'em they choice of balcony

Game that I spit and the length of my hair (okay)

And yes, I'm still spendin' that Kris Kross cream (haha)

Please, don't move too fast
I scared of y'all niggas and my nerves is bad""
So sad but I won't think twice
We rich, we get the best judicial advice
Threaten my life with them words that they utterin'

In the pros, we live for the crowd roar

Run, but all in fun

Super hero status, what a baller feels, uh

Charge to the rim, like runaway freight
No time to waist, don't hesitate
Tear the rim down, make the whole house shake

When they cut the heat up, and the pressure's mountin
It's game time playa
When you go in OT, wit the shot clock countin
It's game time playa
When the double team ""D"", got you surrounded
It's game time playa
When it come off the glass, better rebound kid
It's game time playa

Clear the lane, he's high oc-tane
All gased up, that dude got game
Three point land, that dude got range
Swish, beat the buzzer that dude got aim
Ain't about the fame, but the love for the sport
Blood sweat and tears, seen thier hunger on the court
Ain't nothin stoppin the ""D"", like ain't nothin stoppin me
From droppin three from top of the key

Down low in the paint, better get ya weight up

Than your homey's on the corner who pourin' that malt liqour
Sicker than sick I'm flippin' a switch
Im inventin' a feelin' of venomous spit I been in this bitch uh
Girls, broads, boppers females
Rims blades choppin' spree-well's
Draper Inc. records we sell
With the Clipse offically Big boy shells...

I don't mean to brag
I don't mean to boast, but
Baby I'm A Roller
Now move them things up and down the coast
Like daddy showed ya'
Keep heat close on the waist Fa-SHO
Always been a soldier
Hoes and money that's all I know
Definition of a roller...roller

Center of attention my back to the ropes
All eyes on me the streets got me in they scope
Ain't hard to tell a nigga reelin' in that dough
In a 4.6 range feelin' like the pope
I keep it real close this you can quote
For any motherfucker maybe feelin' like I'm joke
But I'm not Richard Pryor
But prior to rap I was cookin' crack over an open fire
Why they wanna try and play malicious
I'm humble to the point I down play my riches
This is what it is it's hard to be discreet
While the frank mueller watch play peak-a-boo to sleeve
Tucked in the chain in order for you to breathe
I'm out into a mote here this is you to me
The comparison is way to embarrasin'
Niggas ain't averagin' what I'm averagin'

I don't mean to brag
I don't mean to boast, but
Baby I'm A Roller
Now move them things up and down the coast
Like daddy showed ya'
Keep heat close on the waist Fa-SHO

First nigga to rock Play Cloths on stage, besides myself
Come to my city, sold out crowds and shit
Showin respect, we love that shit
Uh, Trendsetter nigga
Okay

Feel this, I'm fearless, now hear this
Tackled it after Lupe killed it
Push-Ton, the last son of Mildred
Stumbled upon the rock like a pilgrim
Made money, money made power
Unstepped on as it came off the Mayflower
I come from graffiti'd halls
Now the X marks the spot on my graffiti walls
Statuettes- X'd eyes on those graffiti dolls
Ghetto Bitches ask why- I say it's just because
The double entendres remind you of Andre 3K
Make you spin it back like a DJ
This track feeling like it's D-day
Fucking with P it might be D-day
My heroin lines like checking out at BJ's
Uh, yeah, uh-huh

Dumb It Down
Street nigga version of (C'mon, ugh)
Numb It Down (Ugh, let's go)

Way before my first mil'
Hustler's etiquette been instilled
Since a young'n been a rider since the big wheel
Count my dollars in big bills
You can't touch me, I'm sick like leprosy
I'm that ill
Check my legacy
Catch me out in Beverly
Hills on Rodeo, with Ocean Drive checkin' for my J-Lo
The chain like a pot of gold
I pied piper them hoes, follow the rainbow
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, we hustle hard
Re-up gang CEO, must be a god
From no business, to 50-50 deals
Joint ventures got the fans screaming ""Clipse, we missed you""
So I could never diss you
Download or not, nothing stops Malice from ordering a drop
Nothing stops Malice from driving off the lot
The eyes on high, the water's boiling in the pot

Numb it down (uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Numb it down
Big shout out to Currency
Repping those Play Cloths hard
You know
My nigga Wilay what up
Sound like some morphine shit right here
Numb it down
Fade that shit out, uh

Pusha Ton is in the building
Powder to the motherfucking ceiling
I'm so consistent every verse
I prototyped this coke flow, y'all just my children
Don't get caught up in your feelings because
You just original fakes and I am the cause
If you follow fashion, you can follow my bars
If not, get your Hypebeast on, follow the blogs

No one on the corner

Two diamond chains, my neck on its double-dutch
Standing in my action figure pose for them hoes
A.P.C. Denim the tops is Play Cloths
Yuugh! The trend-humper vs. the trend-setter
The CL is V-12, the V for vendetta

All this money...

No one on the corner got swagger like us
Cocaine cowboys, too much to flush
You can't comprehend all the paper I touch
All the jewels run their colors; then the chain just blush
I see, I want, I cop, hardtop
I Busta Rhymes—""Tear the roof off""—I must
Lamborghini two-door, drug dealer's rush
Bad bitch, shotgun, new Lou Vuitton clutch
Purse says ""Hérmes,"" not Von Dutch
I Autobahn lean on the clutch like a crutch
Who you know this fly? Give it to 'em pinched right
Gucci hard-bottoms, names scribbled in the inside
See you haters through the Gs on the aviator lenses
My friends in Benzes
Three Ms on the hood emb-uh-lem
Got the curtains pulled back so the sun shines
And it's just me shimmering

I say it's more about style rather than fashion
It's class when you show a ho cash without flashin'
I can even grab on they ass without askin'
The '09 Jag, look what the cat dragged in
My past no good, my present still shameful
The fact I'm in his nose should show that I'm no angel
By far, my baddest bitch was Anglo
Met her in London Fog, Burberry raincoat
We ain't in the same boat, throw on the life jacket
Voted for Barack, McCain was my tax bracket, though
I Sarah Palin hoes, kick 'em out, leave the clothes
Back to the pipeline, luckily I'm twinkletoes
I hold the flask with a wrinkled nose
My connect basis is a need-to-know
The gavel slam and I'm free to go
It couldn't have ended on a sweeter note, yes!

It's the reincarnation of Raekwon in an apron
Lou' Vuitton printed and coke scented
Winding through the flow cuz it's so vintage
Nothing like these timid gimmick, prepaid rappers with no minutes
The real niggas live it; they mimic, they H-O-V lane it and don't pin it
The difference, the Blue Magic ain't in it
We should form a senate to govern critic opinion
I watched them niggas throw away the pennant
To he who claims to be the heir, how dare Pusha nay-say it
Them niggas hear me and they mayday it
So I could care less if Jay say it, it's too political when Jay say it!
He play the game, just instant replay it
The best duo ever

This my letter to the better, I Masta Ace

Finger to the judge, echoing our sentiments

Prepare for the flood, as written in Genesis
With more birds than Noah
No escape, trapped in the whale like Jonah
The SL showing I'm grown up
Passenger side, a bitch prettier than Sho'nuff
No bluff, I cuff that nine milli
I show 'em I'm a soldier, boy - I get silly
My pigeon flown the coop, I free Willy!
My cup too full, I know niggas'll kill me
But I don't bow, even though the crown's heavy
Table cracks, they saying they found Wezzy
Label me the rock king like Presley
But I prefer that hard rock especially (yuugh!)

You know
E-everybody in the game who
Who they've been sayin' for the past ten years is going to jail
They've been wishin' jail on us for the past ten years
That's crazy, right? Haha!
I love it though
Fuck 'em

Tell me, how could you go against the lord's will
Count my blessings every time them Yokohama's squeal
Or that engine purr, that fur feline feel
Death to haters so I gives it to them overkill
Over kill chill in chains like field niggas
You know my roots, my history's revealed nigga
Straight fish scale, all I'm missing is gills
The rosé spills on that eel skin 
Thousand gram relay, we just passin' the baton
Niggas runnin' the race just to settle for Solange (second)
Every bitch love 'em, they just sit and discuss 'em
He just they closest thing to heaven, only god's above 'em
Keep the devil below me, getting money to show me
I ride the 'rari, hopped over the Aston, I'm Kobe
They wishin' death, as they see my worth escalate
I'm driven by the disgusting niggas, so I welcome hate

Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no
Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no

Imma leave it in my memoirs, Chauffeurs and foreign cars
Lines 'round the building the fan's paying homage
The charms resilient, the women too willin'
Barcelona, Spain on the beach, the sun's brilliant
I give to the hood, I pose with the children
Even though I got ties to the rock like a pilgrim
I got guns and papers to conceal them
Once revealed the fury is unyieldin'
'Til then, steppin' out the coupe like I'm in slow mo
Play Cloths, fucking up the game like I'm Romo
Lord knows them hoes is my Goliath
They already know, come to daddy and imma buy it
Under the palm trees, you feeded my papaya
The latest in Louie bags, 
 three times 'for the rooster crows
To the fed's it ain't mine, let the truth be told

Nothing gonna stop us now, you can't stop us
What you gonna do right now, you can't run
We need the boss in you, we've lost this year
Cause ain't nobody doing you're thing, we do, oh no

The prelude to Til The Casket Drops
Third time's a charm motherfuckers
We done seen it all, We done done it all
We done been through it all
Ain't nothing but warriors here
Yes!
Turn my headphones up

They say the third time's a charm, I say that's too long
To go unrecognized when you're a phenom
Clearly you can see that I'm the best like I'm in neon
Til the Casket Drops, the greatness is reborn
No excuses, no more 
Got a newfound love for everything that's jewish, I
Duck the Judas and I dodged old Brutus
The backstabber out the way
Motherfucker's let's do this, It's the
Hood's Obama, shovelin' McCain
Out the project windows, the Drama's insane
The rap game's upside down like David Blaine
You fans is Times Square for following them lames
I gave you truth, revealed my proof
Loosened the knots from your minds I was your masseuse
The message got twisted, I'm just young, black and gifted
The theme was coke, but the line's was uplifting
On my road to the riches with the bitches in the cars
It ain't hard to tell we can't all be Nas
The truth really is we can't all be stars
But I'll be goddamned if I settle for Bronze - ever!

Haha! Never!
Never, motherfuckers!
Til the Casket Drops!
As If you don't know!
All we give you is classics!

Dear god forgive my iniquities
The triple beam weighed it down like it's Mister T
I play the keys, Beethoven had the center piece
Stayed with them bundles, a joy since they infancy
Y'all in disbelief, the coach roofless
Cruise by I smack 'em in the face like the Stooges, as if
You can be like me, niggas is clueless
The insulated doors silence the acoustics
Nothing beats a true flip I do it in the dark
I cut it just right like when I parallel park
My hands in the white like on the parallel bars
The coke that I push is as pure as a child's heart (My God)
I still take part, I can't even say formally
Til The Casket Drop or cops corner me
Oyster Rollie watch, white diamonds adorning me
You better cry for yourself, ain't no sense in you mournin' me

No, ain't no mourning us
If I die today or tomorrow I done it all
You tell me how you one of the best, huh?
You better cry for yourself !

Wrist wear, did it up, neck wear, lit it up
Overdid it, platinum patron till we spit it up
Scarves and the belts with the logos knitted up
Been fly, delve in my photos nigga dig it up
Came from the school where you break bricks, whip it up

Based on the Hustler's that get they paper chase on
Blueprints rose to the game get your trace on
Motels back at work, Clerks write the plates wrong
Hotel's looking so familiar like Trey Songz

I guess that way they get to keep what they owe ya
But it's not a cell that hold us
As long as the rock's in the pan like the Cold Crush

Close girlfriends, broke ‘em apart like Kit-Kats
Old to me now, bitch used to blow me down
Big Bad Wolf with my homie, we calls her “Hand-Me-Down”
Haha, feels like I’m taking off
Set the camera up, look at her take ‘em off
Jeans stuck at her ankles, now, watch her shake ‘em off
Rep ruined in one night, now, I’m skating off
What you thought was get-back was jsut wack
Comparing notes and chokes as we sit back
High-fiving off the stunt we pulled
A good girl gone bad for good, by Push-Ton

I had her, and he had her
Then, he had her; now, we’ve had her
Now, I had her, and he had her
And he had her; now, we’ve had her
You see, I had her; then, he had her
Then, he had her; now, we’ve had her
See, I had her; then, he had her
Then, he had her; now, we’ve had her

I just take my pick and roll, pass it off, give and go
I can’t get involved, feelings make it difficult
Sparing your heart is me, be an adult
Before it goes too far, I bring it to a halt
My girl find out, I turn to the Hulk
So ‘less it’s for good luck, you don’t throw salt
And give thought to how the fairytale ends
I tell her, I insist on her keeping her male friends
I can’t take the blame for you catching a tailwind
Stick to the script, like Biggie would tell Kim
Bitches got the audacity
Thinking they gon’ be my wife-to-be; now, kick it, bitch
I buy ‘em all, Louie, pardon my bag of tricks
The C4 S4, they ask to sit
With dual airbags in case I crash the whip
220 redline, I got cash to get

I had her, and he had her
Then, he had her; now, we’ve had her
Now, I had her, and he had her
And he had her; now, we’ve had her
You see, I had her; then, he had her
Then, he had her; now, we’ve had her
See, I had her; then, he had her
Then, he had her; now, we’ve had her

See, sis?
We do girl records, right?
Hahahahahahaha
Yo, I be calling you, telling you ‘bout all this shit that be going on down here
Fast bitches
You know I like fast girls, though
I can’t—You know what I’m saying?
I always need ‘em fast
They always forget they past
Then, we both wake up
Hahahahaha

Hot damn! But them boys want the (money man)
Hooooouuuuuu, hooooouuuuuu
Hooooouuuuuu (What you say, what you say)
Hot damn!

My, how the boy's grown
From roaming low-income homes to homes of his own
No catching up, he's in a whole another zone
Still true to his roots, stay close to the chrome
Haters stay clear of 'em, y'all stand cheer for him
Got up out the game and overcame, let's hear it for him
Keep a new toy, so I wonder how could
I not enjoy life, I'm reliving my childhood
Big chain monster, whip game bonkers
Monster truck, remind him of Tonka
Diamond F color, plush gold, still gutter
My deal is in the mils, motherfucker, and I ain't stutter
Bittersweet, my life's a musical
From holding nose to rose gold, the Lord's beautiful
Before him I'm too shamed to show my face
But shit's so mean can't help but to fall from grace
, motherfucker

Hot damn! It's a new day!
Hot damn! But them boys want the (money man)
Hooooouuuuuu, hooooouuuuuu
Hooooouuuuuu (What you say, what you say)
Hot damn!

Hot damn, when the white hit the pan, it
Twists and it tumbles, it flips and it fumbles
I mix it like gumbo,
 I pitch it so subtle, I
Keep hustlers puzzled, Feds, I got 'em wondering
(Wondering) What happened to that boy?
Six maneuver, how'd I slip into that toy?
Is it the pimp, the crook, the hustler thing
The man, the music they're making a king
I'm simply building my mink, a million men marching like Khan
The King Kong of verse, making the world sing
My heart's on the sleeve for dark faces just like mine
Peeking through bars, hoping the sun shines on 'em
But you still got to watch the phonies
Watch your homies, we (*gunshots*) got you homie

Hot damn! It's a new day!
Hot damn! But them boys want the (money man)
Hooooouuuuuu, hooooouuuuuu
Hooooouuuuuu (What you say, what you say)
Hot damn!

Yuugh, 
handled the rock like none other
Wrist over the stove, head under the cupboard
In the kitchen 'til the fume make me feel smothered
The way it melt, fiends can't believe it's not butter
The way it melt, he won't cop from none other
Then he who holds Os like Krispy Kreme's oven
Or Easy Bake
, pink Dibis make
The Presidential look like strawberry shortcake, P
(Imagine that Rolls Royce crashed and me unscratched
In that Billionaire Boy's Club fashion
Uh, you niggas is clones
 I hand out styles
Like ice cream cones, the fuck outta here) That's for real
My gats is real, SL 5 is lookin like the Batmobile
Chrome lips with the matching wheels, uh
Both chains probably match your deal
Y'all dudes is an act for real, Pusha

Hot damn! It's a new day!
Hot damn! But them boys want the (money man)
Hooooouuuuuu, hooooouuuuuu
Hooooouuuuuu (What you say, what you say)
Hot damn!

Neither the sun or death can be looked at, that's what a OG told me
That was the exact moment I decided to take a pack
And if you owe me and if I decided to take it back
It wasn't nicely, expect Roscoe to put you back, in place
I'm on you call a destructive warpath
It'll be shell showers in today's forecast, you a gangsta? I can't tell
Your diamonds don't glimmer when the light hit it
Those jewels aren't genuine, because if they was
I'm nice with it, I woulda' been took that
That skinny stack in your pocket, I woulda been shook that
In this world you gotta watch it, I'm hear to warn you
Cats turned informant, over snow wrapped in wax
My son's home cryin', don't give me no slack
Just put the motherfucking money in the bag
These words are being said as I hide behind glove and mask
Coldchain's not your typical crook, I'm being watched
Look at the camera lens and push

First the firing then the siren you'll be hearin'
Your man got a few heartbeat lefts they fearin'

It's me or you or them or us
Regardless of what them things gon' bust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I clear the land, in god we trust, nigga

You come in here for me, nigga it's the blaze of glory
The blaze of glory, the blaze of glory

Eghck! fuck ya crews and who ya choosin'
Critics and news and all their reviews
The watch jewelled and VSS jewels with
Different hues of rogues or blues
The street movement that I move with
Hurries the caine like Miami U
Ya niggas foolin', what you doing
Obviously you ain't got a clue
It's the blaze of glory, I'm killer in the clutch
Like the Lakers' Horry with four seconds left
Rappers can't ignore me, quit steppin' on my heel
You fuckers riding my flow like I'm your trainin' wheels, ugh!
Mind over matter, SL blacker
Sunny days, I minus the thinking cap ROOF!
You niggas fishin', well wishin'

Sheah, the blaze of glory, rewrite history
Turn pages for me, my story is epic
Hustle in my blood, my story is metric
Bring that O backwards I'm feeling dyslexic
Grew up misdirected, dark complected
Sometimes no electric, it was hectic, it was harsh;
I was awed, I was affected, neglected
At sixteen, I got connected like Tetris
Had the power to zone, turn powder to stone
In any beef, iron drept it, iron tested
Think back, I invested, I assessed it, I reflected
Think back, I was requested by God
I shall lead as I was directed
Demand to be king, I was selected a menacing thing
Defying the odds, defying with arms
A tyrant's evolved, the tyrant is on, so run for ya weapon nigga!

It's me or you or them or us
Regardless of what them things gon' bust
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I clear the land, in god we trust, nigga

You come in here for me, nigga it's blaze of glory

I'm for that hit rich quick shit, for that quick lick
For that quick Vick fucker, I ain't for the bullshit
I ain't for the small talk, strictly bout the ballpark
Figures on my numbers these niggas is all talk
Niggas is missing out on life, I ain't hit him
I ain't sitting round thumb-twiddlin', I ain't wishin'
No one could ever tell the Malicious I ain't livin'
The home town homies hate my name, I ain't tripping
I don't retaliate, I don't hate, I obliv' them
Jesus 'round my neck, I'm a Christian I forgive 'em
I was chosen to hold this throne
I held my own, ever since I held that zone
And served it, from all the days I heard mama's curses
Now I put it in verses, it was worth it
Don't let it hurt kid, push a pack, cook a crack
Whatever be the plate, motherfucker get the bank, uh!

You are now listening to the all-time phenomenal
Used to bag work in VA at the Econo Lo'
Now I'm laying out at the Delano though
But don't get it twisted, the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing ""Geronimo!""
Pull up in the CL, the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb, they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch, she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit, I don't know
Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano, I mean, Pharrell'll know
The head shop bitch from D.C., ay P, let 'em know!

If you knew what I used to do
But call me uncle, yeah, Uncle Cam
I tax 'em (Like who?) Like Uncle Sam
From the jungle, fam, where niggas bundle grams
Fumble or you crumble, get murked on the humble (Annnd)
The gat on the belt on the hip (Annnd)
I keep it for real with the clips
Drive a hard bargain
 (bargain)
I'm Harlem's only Gagarin, car foreign
The other man stood-stood stutter-fied
I know your moms well, tell your mother ""Hi""
I'm the other guy that got your mother high

Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-Caps
 to 
avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope returned like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like ""Saturday Night Fever""
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the Feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is repent, ugh

Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you?
Heh, you should call me uncle

Third time's the charm right? Hahaha!
Come on

I'm kinda like a big deal
It's unbelievable, you see my warning gives you big chills
The flow running on BIG's heels
My life after death, BIG ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's the charm, baby
After two classics, another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessing to blow a hundred thou' in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha-ha, we're ballin', drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin', Re-Up is the gang and I'm all in
To the powder and the flame I have fallen
Get money, blow money is my calling
Yuugh! Watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push

They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

Ayo, I'm sitting on top of the, it's more than a feeling, ain't it?
I be killing, damn it, I'm illin', I'm illin', ay-ay-ay-ay
Meet Mr. Popular, go get your binoculars
And see ""Penthouse 3"" where a nigga be
Spitting fire on a PJ, in my PJs
Fire Marshall said I took it to the max like TJ
Y'all ain't peep, I said Marshall's, replay
I guess I'm like the black Marshall meets Jay
Meet 'Ye, alligator souffle, got it made
Special Ed got head from a girl in special ed
You know the pretty ones in that dumb class
But she got that dumb ass
Hit high school and got pregnant dumb fast
""What happened, Tisha? Your boyfriend come fast?""
Turn around, give me pound like we folks
""Hell no, I went raw, dawg, three strokes""

They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting
Pardon me, I must say, I'm kinda like a big deal

Lights, cameras, action!
The chain itself's a damn distraction
You claim the belt, the glory I bask in
I'm B. Hop in the ring, niggas, you cash in
It's like stopping a train, nigga think he's stopping my reign
Talk slick while dropping my name?
I'm putting y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits, I X out the middleman
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
The C-4S with the rims protruding
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me looking to the heavens like a javelin throw
Y'all twiddle your thumbs like the average Joe
But just as you reap, so shall you sow

They whispering about us, I know you haters doubt us
How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting

Freedom,Til the Casket Drops,2010,"Speak, speak of freedom
Sing of amber, all ways of grain

With every line written, and all I have given
Music’s been nothing more than a self-made prison
I’ve taken inmate losses at the hands of this one
My pen’s been the poison to family and friendships
Now it’s time to mend shit, time to bring closure to
The clear conscience of Pusha is long overdue
Thinking to myself, what could I be owing you?
They only tell you you great when they're reminiscing over you
Before I Trouble T-Roy, it’s just a D-boy
Let me play the role of a Common on his B-boy
Speaking my truth in rhyme, no matter how bland it is
A heavy heart lightened, that’s just what my ransom is
All apologies, I bear the cross, I wear the blame
We in the same group but I don’t share my brother’s pain
Not to confuse, our sentiments are all the same
I just don’t feel nothing, I’m numbed by the will to gain
Same thing brought tears to innocents
I turned away and didn’t even flinch, yuugh!
The music drove me crazy
Looked up and lost the first bitch I ever wanted to have my babies
Nowadays she can’t even face me, I’m sorry for the heartbreak
I promised you forever my lady, Jodeci baby
Pompous motherfucker, just look what them jewels made me
I’m only finding comfort in knowing you can’t replace me
What a thing to say, but what am I to do?
I’m role-playing a conscious nigga and true is true
Cocaine aside, all of the bloggers behooved
My critics finally have a verse of mine to jerk off to
I own you all

Speak, speak of freedom
Sing of amber, all ways of grain

This is where the buck stop, here's where I draw the line
I touch the hem, God's work is so divine
I've seen the error of my ways over time
Never to return, Malicious has been refined
Like wine, with time I get better
Napa Valley vintage, my flow is fermented
Now drink of me, as if I bought the bar
Run to these words, as if there's no tomorrow
Never mind my car, careful what you wish for
Behind every curtain the devil and his pitchfork
Jealousy, I ask thee, ""What is this for?""
How was I to know I was happy being piss-poor?
No, whore, that's not love, we was fucking
I was in search of a chickenhead, you was clucking
And I was lusting, we were both out of order
I should've known better as I'm reminded of my daughter
Am I my brother's keeper or for himself every man?
I have been your reaper, there's blood on my hands
Accept me as your keeper, there's been a change of plans
Careful what you speak of, I've come to understand, preach

What else you want from us, huh?!
What more can you ask? We've given you everything
We lost life, we lost love
We lost family behind this shit
This shit you call music, we call this shit life
We gave you proof, they ain't give you shit!
We gave you truth, do I entertain you motherfucker?!
Well dance then bitch!

Every All-Star, every Cancun
Every holiday, South Beach in full bloom
Thousand dollar suites, white sheets, white rooms
I've got a bright future, neck like a full moon
Buy what we want, spend what they want
Young, rich, hot nigga, everything she wants
Triple beams scales got me under deep spells
Kiss my forehead, momma knows I mean well
Cocaine bought me everything I ever had
And I ain't never been scared to spend my very last
Cause I can get it back, watch me get it back
Last 2 or 10 bricks, shit I'm cooking that

My life's too real to be a PSA
The million in the ceiling's for a rainy day
I cut it, then whip her like she Annie Mae
Praise God, I escaped by His amazing grace
Nah, never was I saving face
Some family ties are impossible to break
The Almighty Judge, only He can save me
Don't cry for us now, just pray for our babies
Mercedes 5, with the open roof
Miami high rise in the ocean view
The tell-tale signs that expose the truth
Lil Willy Rat King, this one's for you

Cars, crib, everything big body
Big charm, hanging from my big chain
Swing side to side, feeling like I'm T-Pain
Pull up to the crib, bitch thinks she's seeing thangs
Make a hundred stacks, blow it like it's pocket change

If the good die young, then the greats go to jail
I miss my Tony, hope you snitches burn in hell
Kiss and tell with sales on us ballers
All because them two doors coming with big spoilers
All because them bitches is acting like they jaw-less
And we don't count money, we weigh it like fish orders

Hoe I'm major, that shit nothing
Young nigga, old money, Benjamin Button
Seeing through your poker face, that nigga bluffing
Ladies going gaga for a nigga tryna fuck 'em
Nickel plate tuck it, hesitate nothing
And I got the AR, why I like to bust it?
Why I need counseling? Why I won't discuss it?
Why I spend Donkey Kong knots in the mall like fuck it?
Pull up at the stop light, looking at this cop like
Yeah I drive big shit, naw my license ain't right
Still let the top drop back when it's sunny
Cause life ain't nothing but bitches and money

I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention, I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Saying fuck the rest, it's time to shine
I know that's how, the good ones died
But I need that risk, I need that drive
I'm stealing your bitch, I'm stealing your grind
Bitches sing this, and that's why I'm
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy

Old school Chevy, wide body like a Phantom
5 stars love him but them haters can't stand him
UK money, 150 thousand pounds
All-white Lamb sitting low to the ground
I just joined the game, the Millionaire Boys Club
Gave me a box of baking soda and a skateboard
I'm in the kitchen putting the work on steroids
Peeking out the blinds for the Feds, I'm paranoid
Naw I ain't platinum, but how I'm a millionaire?
I know this a four-door, so how it ain't no ceiling there?
Showing off little mama, going hard little daddy
Yo Gotti homeboy and I'm a walking dope package

I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention, I just can't hide
Keep hearing these voices inside my mind
Saying fuck the rest, it's time to shine

Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy
Showin' out lil' mama, showin' out lil' daddy

I'm from the era of letter to the better
They tell me rap changed, well I'ma have to let her
Common loved her, I wish I never met her
They slutted her out, there's nothing left to treasure
Seems all I hear em say, ""Nigga, where them dollars at?""
Here they go right here, tell them niggas holla back
Hit it then I quit it then I step like a welcome mat
That 2010 got me feeling like I'm all of that
Re-Up Gang trinity, Liva, me and Pusha T
Got my money right, them haters tight like virginity
They don't understand how I feed off the energy
My table is prepared in the presence of my enemies

I don't know what is, it's something inside
I need that attention, I just can't hide

Hey! I did it! I really did it!
I'm like the poster child for niggas that just get it, get it
I'm supposed to smile for my niggas who ain't here to live it
I'm putting money on they books so they can ball in prison
And feel the spirit of a boss, dual pipe exhaust
All we know is to floss
I'm cocaine Cassel and throwing bombs to Moss
My bitch keeps the newest and the latest
A street nigga, she know I'm the greatest, hey, hey
Hold up that Rosé, pouring half the bottle out

If not yourselves, then you need to have them kids in church
Mistook my work for selling crack
You should've got more out of it then that
My Grandma would say ""boy you backwards as the hat""
Rather in a trap, NFL draft pick or rap
Virginia's for hustlers, hustlers get it back
I thought that life was a bad bitch, bad car
Life is with your kids watching Madagascar
In the headrest of the H3 with crash bar
Rocking Play Cloths, every day's a catwalk

Earn my respect, niggas hating cause they want that
Been to hell and back, only champions can walk that

Talk that, put yo money where ya mouth is
Tee off on the green, golf course is where the house is
A long way from pumping out housing projects
Investing in real estate, weighing out my prospects

Footsteps,Til the Casket Drops,2009,"Follow the leader, exhaust pipes and breathers
The flash from the barrel turns bullies to believers
The time of a life make the bitches wanna keep ya
This is my reality, want it? Well let me teach ya
Follow my footsteps through tragedy and triumph
Through flows give you mein kämpf
Kilos consigned 'em, 
do as I say like Simon
And you too will diamond blind hun
I'm on my Dylan, 
Dillinger flow just killing ya
You wonder why the real ain't feeling ya, you're frauding
I Mason jar Martin Margiela them O's together
Since Hov was name dropping Charles Jourdan
I kept them nodding, snorting
Slobbing, barfing, and bought cars off them
The realest rapper that's unwrapping got them
If you can fit these shoes than walk them
I parked them

I could have been a goner but I had to save my soul
I'm out here chasing my dreams, looking for a place to go
Trying to get up out the ghetto, come follow with my footsteps
Put down the heavy metal and follow in my footsteps
Cause if you don't, it might be danger

It's not for you to do what I do, rather do what I say
These footsteps could lead you astray
Lead you to the cell or lead you to a grave
Either way, you might never see the light of day
Don't let my wrongs give you the right of way
To emulate my past escaping the law's grasp
Told you the truth, yet who was I to brag?
Especially seeing how Kimani finds it hard to laugh
I miss my homie by she's missing her dad
It weighs on my conscience and I hate conscious rap
Apart from that, I wish to see you succeed
So I speak to my people in spirit of chuck D
You behind the glass, trust me, it cut deep
And the words to every verse haunted me in my sleep
So now what you see is Malice's contradiction
He who has ears, I hope you're listening, come on

I could have been a goner but I had to save my soul
I'm out here chasing my dreams, looking for a place to go
Trying to get up out the ghetto, come follow with my footsteps
Put down the heavy metal and follow in my footsteps
Cause if you don't, it might be danger

Follow me like Twitter nigga, you can check the timeline
I'm the quiet one but my intellect is Einstein
I'm so unnerved by the shit that I've observed
Just looking at you coons got a nigga lost for words
Verge of insanity, I'm at my crossroads
Shame on the birds that led em like lost souls
We got it wholesale, we move it like Cosco's
Mercy on the court left us standing here heart broke

I taught you how to cut it, cook it on hot stove
I taught you how to share them when fucking with hot hoes
I taught you how to rock right shit up on your toes
I taught you how to smile for the camera when heartbroke
I've been the inspiration for all you industry dick tasters
To your local dream chaser I am King Push
I set the stage for all these triple beam hooks
I weighed mountains while them niggas just sang hooks (yuugh)

Oh, oh, oh, your mama said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your grandmama said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your baby sister said
Oh, oh, oh, your nigga said
Oh, oh, oh, now your whole block said
Oh, oh, oh, oh, your old teacher said
Oh, oh, oh, your misses said
Oh, oh, oh, your preacher said, yeah

I could have been a goner but I had to save my soul
I'm out here chasing my dreams, looking for a place to go
Trying to get up out the ghetto, come follow with my footsteps

Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Ye-yet yet yet I move on, (You know I gotta go and get it)
Yeh-yes I move on (There ain't no other choice in it)
Yeh-yes I move on (Ain't tryin' to be a part of the percentage)
Yeh-yes I move on (Hear me out now)

Where I'm from see us guys don't believe in luck (No!)
I can't believe what they doin' to my nigga, Buck
(Tryin' to hang my nigga!)
Facin' time, twenty-five to life
Twenty-five the same thing as life (You tell me!)
Only chips is to fight or to forfeit
Baby momma tryin' to make the mortgage
Daughters prayin', try'na put cha back up in the portrait
Uh, it's like the tears never stop
When you was home it's like they smiles never drop
Collect calls with all the hopes of the best
And hang up with a knot in my chest
See, see your cell is my hell
My hell is our pain
The hurt gonn' never stop until we see you home again
And that's all we wanna see
Maybe in a dream, but not a memory
Forget that, hold your head man, head man
Last night what I seen made my life change

Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change

Yeh-yes I move on (Ain't tryin' to be a part of the percentage)
Yeh-yes I move on (Hear me out now)

I was wretched, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked (Filthy!)
So much so I had left my family forsaken (I'm sorry, babe!)
A troubled soul whose heart was often achin' (Can you forgive me?)
So much dough but my spirit ever so vacant
Foul and flagrant, I was taken off course (I was lost!)
The road ahead should have ended me in divorce (I see now)
But now I see clearly with the family of four
Never did I deserve a two-seater Porsche (Never!)
Heart filled with remorse, my life was such a mess
Now I'm back on board, due to the Lord's GPS (I'm back!)
180 degree turn, whoever could've guessed?
Malice believe in his heart and out my mouth I confess
YES... more than blessed, I was choosen
I been on the troop, my wisdom is that of old men
Wasted so much time stuntin' for folk (Wasted so much time!)
When really the whole time I was just stuntin' my growth (Can't get that back!)
A message to the youth, what I'm offerin' is hope
Now something's gotta change. I'm at the end of my rope, cause

Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change

Yeh-yes I move on (Hear me out now)

Uh, Lord knows I done seen the worlds cold shoulder
Seein my future through the crystal-ball of bakin' soda
Oasis of hoes, my champagne supernova
The high life and high times, I watched 'em turn sober
Seen it all come crashin', crashin'
The Feds was at the door, and no they not askin'
Sayin' they found drugs, but they ain't talkin' aspirin
Diesel design ones and I ain't talkin' fashion

Money hoes and clothes is Malice's past tense (The past is past!)
All said forgiven, all you do is askin'
Even when laughin' I can't explain the hurt
Knowin' I can't change the world in a verse (I wish I could!)
Even to myself, I'm feelin' my screw's loose
But how can I deny what I know to be true? (I gotta live with myself!)
When I didn't have a clue, shoulda viewed it as a gift
Now I see what they mean - ignorance is bliss (I see what they mean)

Last night what I seen made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change
Made my life change

Temptation always been my nemesis
A few sips then take her back to my premises
Innocence lost once again
How could we be more than friends?
Baby don't be mad, think back of the fun that we had
The love we share so cheap like a E-Class
You ain't alone, I too am a sleaze bag
I guess I need ""Celebrity Rehab""
Because, ain't no real chance at love
All my wrongdoings forbid me to trust
Oh God, forgive me for lust
Don't let another heart get crushed, come on

Think you better go to counseling
Tame the beast you keep inside (yeah)

Maybe I'm crazy, maybe, just maybe
It's hard finding time, can't tell me I'm lazy
The way my phone ring may seem a bit shady
I'm 'bout my cash money, ma, maybe it's baby

Never Will It Stop,Til the Casket Drops,2009,"Never will it stop
The 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust
Fuck what ya heard, you ain't countin' paper like us

Go-getter, I come from the corner like most niggas
Now from afar, I toast niggas, roast niggas
Anywhere, whichever the coast nigga
Compare me to them two ghost niggas -- Hail Mary
Heart break when they tales fairy
I kissed that girl and I likes it, like Kate Perry
The tongue-tester
Niggas on the corner juggle Os for the king, like a jester
Child of a lesser, God, so when I drop the top
It's my way of feeling closer to the Lord
Reaching for the heavens; 'til then, I settle for the 7
30 floors upper, room key at the Western
With her on her back, and her on her knees
My ghetto ass trying to pronounce they dungarees
I say Raph, they say Raf Simon
They think it's real cute while they giving me dome

Liva, heh, the cross I bear
So fly in that Purple Label cloth I wear
No matter the cost, I make Porsche like fear
Every stitch, every seam, when I floss, y'all stare
Ferrari 500, them horse I tear
I circle, I veer, y'all pause like deer
In the headlights, mami play red light, green light
And hop that red torch I steer
There's no law I've feared, arm glowin' like a roadside flare
King-pin so the soft I shared
I carried, I huddled, I dared, I muscled, I bled
I sweated, I teared, got crowned and got cheered
You 10 grand quarter pound ration
Went 36 flat, that's a asking, now two-thirds got it for a fraction
A cinder, put in the dash in the fender
Dryer sheets, that cover that scent that it renders

Never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Never will it stop
The 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust
Fuck what ya heard, you ain't countin' paper like us
A million in the ceiling I can touch

And still don't nothing move but the money
Nothing like 50 bricks wrapped like the mummy
With the return ensures the second coming
So tongue-numbing nigga, you can bet your last
Not a gram off either, you can bet your ass!
I stay with the fifth since niggas want to grab
Fast life, get it? Y'all is on the fast
And them hoes never say no 'less they on they rag
Louie bags, I trick 'em with good faith
In hopes they return the favor, with good face
Mentally, my mind in a good place
Wake up e'ery morning admiring landscape
Hell, even my garage a menage
Like my hoes exotic, same as my cars
Million-dollar deposit, you suffer from withdrawals
I got in the game in the bag like I'm Claus

Never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Ever, never, never will it stop
Never will it stop
The 50 in the duffel won't crush
It settles to the bottom like dust

Guns N’ Roses,Training Day (The Soundtrack),UnKnown,"Uh uh, uh huh
Clipse (Clipse), Exclusive shit (Exclusive shit)
Yeah, whooo

Guns n' roses mafia proses
Briefcase money, hot cars, and hot clothes
This is the life, nigga that's the life

I wouldn't have it any other way
Yeah, gun play burning loves the one die
Makes me cry some days
Lawless, riding backwards on a one way
D color flawless, bitch I reek of money (bitch)
Fast life, born to die, who gives a fuck
We done seen it all by 25, and lived it up
From the rawest to the raw, to the slug through your door
They missed you but pressed your bitch in a hollow tip bra
There's science to the way we move, cock tools
And walk through the club without scuffing our Prada shoes
On this side we on the by by, we buy the rules
So when you play with us y'all niggas just gotta lose
Lust for them things that turn women to wives
Live for that shit that determines your street size
Run with them twins that waters you mother's eyes
That's diamonds, cocaine, and burners on my thighs
Raw like peeblo, guns and mink coats
Light up canoes, til titanics I sink ships
Love doing bitches with pink lips, call me Padre
Talk shit with a gun in my hand call me cock-ay
Did this straight, bricks ain't large
Bricks for weight, filling a crate, filling a barge, now that's large
Sipping blue ells, and playing cards
Plus a pat on the back from the fucking coastguard
 x2

Yo yo, I got a love for small arms and hair pin triggers
Dare niggas third in my crew, it's known killers
Model hoes that sniff blow with hour glass figures
We live for raw sex and 80 proof liquors
Run, walk, and crawl for catching hot balls
From my dogs who take game while smoking lock jaws
Why burn your mouth in the name of cheat talk
Be prepared to change your tune by the time my heat spark
After dark get your crew for me is a cake walk
And I love rap records with lots of gun talk
It's day time two both pies on waist sides
Can't trace, I cop fat cribs on lake sides
I make five which is why y'all hate
I got dark skin, jet black bitches with jade eyes
We wildin out, hang them high, and dry them out
I do them type of things y'all niggas is lying bout
My speech is the reason my race is dying out
So I pray to God the same time I'm pulling the iron out
We rock stars, smoke red, mixed with lobster
We Jamaican sexing, pillow talking, and pop trois
In pasta, look, you wanna be a mobster
On stage recipient of a nice guy
Malicious nigga y'all cats fictitious
When the shit hits, it's how you know we mean business
 x2

When the slugs hits, I wonder will the pain last
See my life like a movie, inside my brain fast
I'm asking you, cause we used to rock the same ass
When I die, put me in mausoleum with the stained glass, the stained glass
When the slugs hits, I wonder will the pain last
See my life like a movie, inside my brain fast
I'm asking you, cause we used to rock the same ass
When I die, put me in mausoleum with the stained glass, the stained glass",https://genius.com/Clipse-guns-n-roses-lyrics
I’m Lovin’ It (McDonald’s Commerical),UnKnown,2003,"I'm lovin' it is this the place to eat?
Since I don't cook I'll just rock to the beat
I'm lovin' it at the end of the day
To relieve the stress we add a little play
I'm lovin' it sometimes we have mishaps
You Just overcoming adaptive setbacks
I'm lovin' it you know you're my world
How can I mind love taps from my girl?

McDonald's
Ba da ba ba ba
I'm lovin' it

Move your feet, rock to the beat
Hungry for the music gotta eat, I'm lovin' it
I'm lovin' it no guts no glory
Seems like I stumbled in the wrong territory
I'm lovin' it looks can be deceiving
There's a slight change of plans for the evening
I'm lovin' it my cars way too clean
If only I could start this fine piece of machine

Hesi-tate? Never, I'll put hole in whoever
Don't make Push' Russian Roulette ya
Gamble with ya life
Change came from cocaine I've measured
White was the treasure, comfort was the steel
I pedal to the corner like a child on a big wheel
Flow more sicker,
 
so much shake in the street
They measure my weight in Richter
Make no mistake, I rhyme for the public
But still I push yay that make the ghettos quake
By all means I've seen I've lived
By 22 years old, 50 thousand dollar vehicles I rimmed
My dreams start over the stoveI ran over the globe and back again
You seen em, five-ten, hair swingin, dark skinned
Gun on my hip like a sergeant
Wrist Green Power, Chris Tuck' in my watch
Anytime the small hand move, it's Rush Hour

Homie you don't want no probs wit us
Cause we the type of dudes who don't think when we bust
You die (

And you might get hurt walking up to my car

I offer y'all, 24 bars of rawLike eight balls in hard or soft
Time I, push em off, they need help now
Cause I, flood the street with straight melt down
And I'm not proud, in fact I hate this route
This the same game got my brother strung out
So I, count the ways that it fucked up his life
So I don't have a problem with upping my price, uh
And who said the game ain't fair?
A God damn loser!
Look, just like chicks, 
them cats they be runnin' they lips
Worried to death am I still in the Clipse
Well, here's a secret bout me and the Clipse
Even in my absence I'm still the shit ya dig?!
Everything doing it big, from the cars to the home
From the cash to the chrome, they can't say the game ain't grown
Did they tell you bout the nine? I keeps me that
And I don't ever fall off like 
Adebisi Hat
When times get tight
, the coke game like riding a bike
You heavy as me? Not in your life.
 Hang it up


See me in a gold Hummer
With two ??? bitches that makes ???
Somebody touch them, then I'm a bust them
Both hoes is accustomed
To getting coke through customs
They ain't' the average women would cut them
Trey Eighters out the leather blazerPoint 'em at your Chevy BlazerThen bust holes in your Pelle blazerYou 'bout to ride in Hell's elevator
You got somethin' else to say to God?
You gonna have to tell him later
Time is money
Doubt none of y'all find this funny
See I ain't got time for dummies
So I keep the Nina Ross right beside the tummyAnd I'm leavin' with the scratch and the finest bunnyI'm so far from a million dollars
If y'all feel me, holler
Put your drinks in the air, then peel your collar
Chrome wheel Impalas
Make 'em bounce for FAM-LAY
Cuz your drunk ass might get killed tomorrow
Narcs jumpin' out of U-Haul trucks
Leavin' you all stuck
Behind a park bench, balled-up
So I sleep all day, hustle all night
Like a vampire
But I don't suck blood, I bust slugs
Liquor got me trigger-happy
I can tell that you a hater how you lookin' at me
Young boy, but I'll pop

Got Caught Dealin’,UnKnown,1998,"(Chorus)
I got caught dealin, at the age of one-five
Had all my bitches stealin, just tryin to survive
And it was business as usual if one of mine had to die
Cause fuck dat yo, I gotta make sho my dough multiply
Crimes I commit heinous, y'all niggas is brainless
You tied up at gun point, flinch make you famous
Blow make me live aimless, my gun stainless
Aim for your temple, hope you die painless
Illest shit we wore those, marked money we tore those
My whole team channelin coke through urban portholes
You livin like meer immortals, your block's foreclosed
We forty deep on in the street, and fuckin your hoes
Seen your man club bathroom soft stuff heron
Come out, loud talkin and shit, claimin he Don
Hope he know when he step outside baby it's on
Watch my guns illuminate the sky like Vietnam
My confidence shared by all conglomerates
Everyone in my circle is dominant
We live prominent, your world we bombin it
Stuck in the pen? WALK the shit in
Come on and cock it
(Chorus)
Eight-fifty navy blue, kill like a Laker do
Twenty inch chrome shit, who must I say to you
Watch what your lady do
We stoned the fuck out
Not just your car nigga, chrome ya truck out
Calico plastic, twin to match it
Ice white like some Star Wars space gun
Though, that ain't how they come my friend make 'em
Sleek wit 'em like a L.A. nigga, love is day tons
They talk shit you nigga where it hits the procedure
I got rats dim as the site fool quick to switch cheetah
Actually they want the cheeba I'm the owner and leader
Yo my clip's my bitch, I own her and beat her
Huh, shit, dick missile tomahawk
One thing I love is sex discussions and armor talk
Who got all the CEOs disputin?
And my clipse niggas fussin and shootin?
Yo, it's that same nigga
(Hook)
It was.. make money money take money money what?
Make money money take money money what?
Make money money take money money what?
Make money money take money money money
You ain't never seen it like this
Ices this priceless, pullin heist-es
One wrong move, they lifeless
Thug shit, bullets and clips and pwice this
Where I come from niggas shoot guns and dices
What the price is, scratch that we don't ask that
We blast that gat in yo mouth, where the cash at?
That's how I roll drugs get sold but never hold shit
Malice face two-five to life, but never told shit
It's like that, love for my clique, go ahead and light that
When shorty left with no ends, y'all been never bite that
Day in the life, ain't nothin nice how I hit 'em up
Hands high get 'em up, cash tried lit 'em up
Regret that? Countin my stack I had to wet that
Hog tied, telephone cords, speak to the lord
And while the cops untyin you, my whole team eyin you
Cause even if you talk in your sleep my heat fryin you
(Chorus)
I was thankin thankin make money money take money money what?

Roll With The Winners,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Roll with the winners, the soul of the sinners
Which ring, which chain; the most our dilemmas
My uncles before me mixed the diesel in the blenders
Then crack came, I seen the coldest of winters
Mountains of snow -- made fiends tremor
Mink to the floor, we use the crème de la crèmes
Such a need to shimmer, the Benz got the slippers
Club owners love us call us yellow bottle grippers
Flipper? No. Whale scale tipper
I'm from a line of ex-kingpins that's turned sniffers
Pray the Lord forgive us while the maricons fill us
Up to the brim, call them the coffee bean spillers
Blasphemous, he calls kis God's pillows
Ivory white, bury me in my chinchilla
Ain't none iller, no! Ain't none realer
It's Pusha, just ya neighborhood dope dealer

You gotta love the gall on 'im
Twenty on the arm on 'im
Twenty-four inch blades, see the frame fall on 'em
Drug czar, retired, like I was Shawn on 'em
Came back to star -- Jordan as he falls
Released to score raw on 'em, 2.2 pounds exactly
Tape criss-crossed like a bra on 'em
But the streets I was marred, I was scarred on
And ride around microphone fiend with the R on 'em
I'm Bad, James Todd
On the white part of the water, my third got scalds
On the right side of my palm where the soft got hard
On the right price, give me the light, I Sean Paul on 'em
Run the city, Sean John on 'em
New Marvin, screaming ""What's Going On,""
I'm trouble man, I rubberband man, push hard on them
Same block where I crawled on 'em, I'mma fall on 'em

I couldn't dare do the arm, and not the neck with it;
Jesus on the charm, show some respect with it
Don't be alarmed, if y'all don't connect with it
Something like the Arnage, if you select with it
To most a mirage, but even when I'm pinched
The boy far from dreaming, the Porsche with the vents
Tucked in the trunk let the dogs track the scent
""And I don't give a fuck,"" about our best defense
Catch me if you can I am ginger bread
And the mink interior is crimson red;
Y'all talk before they even mention Feds
Of how I got the block like the Dawn of the Dead
Seems amongst thieves that honor is dead
Bucking the court 'till Your Honor is dead
Y'all take heed to what is fall upon ya
You are in the presence, Re-Up, the ensemble

You got no choice but notice me, everything I drop hard
Challenge is wiling out on opium playing dodgeball
With some bullets busting out the narrow barrel
Hitting you hard, your fate don't need no tarot --
Cards to be read, I reads about niggas like you daily, obituary;
Dead weight, my head straight, my bitch is very
Steadfast, that wet ass, ki daddy marry
Float through your city like I'm in a ferry; took the 7-60 off it
Put 8 o'clock on it, Eight-Double Dot-Double Zero
Add four more, you know the time with my earlobes
Niggas is mad, niggas is last, niggas is fake, niggas is late
Niggas need to be in the lake -- the bottom of it
Fuck you buck in new brick boots
With a burgundy wet suit for thinking you death proof, pussy",https://genius.com/Clipse-roll-with-the-winners-lyrics

Seein' my life through the windshields of choppers
I ain't spend one rap dollar in 3 years, holla
Money's the least, drag a b**** by her dog collar
Now *** folla', this is my ghetto story
Like Cham, Ice-P is the Don Dotta
Open the Frigidaire, 25 to life in here
So much white you might think ya Holy Christ is near
Throw on your Louis V millionaires to kill the glare
Ice trays, Nada, all you see is pigeons paired
The realest s*** I ever wrote, not Pac inspired
It's crack pot inspired, my real n***** quote
B**** never cook my ***, why? Never trust a ho with your child
At you make believe rappers I smile, ha
Canals treatin' my style, like you Internet sharing my files
You're my space n******
So kill the comparison, I'm South Beach sippin' on Sara Fin'
Wellfy check n****, I never been, *** money clean through Maryland

Word on the street is you gon' love how it melt
And I don't come with a pitch neither, the s*** sell itself
I yell re-up 'til I'm locked like ma-mia
And get it cross the state with the grace of Maria
Keep on toys, you gon' know us when you see us
Living street tales worthy of Don Divas
K*** in the floor, mistress in Dior
Bitch tell me she love me, but I know she's a ***
Shit could get ugly, *** she talk to the Lord now
It's just what I get, it's the roses of war
*** the bureau, rather be spending Euros
And get fed grapes, *** *** in plurals
Just like Heaven as I gaze at the mural
What a piece of mind when you copy some Shapiro's
Cheers to the future as we toast to life
I'm preventing Miami, I'm a socialite, n****
The cars is big, the cribs is bigger
The kids are happy, the perfect picture

Hello New World [Clean],UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming, ""I'm on my way""
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""
I can't wait for the next n****
From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""
I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up *** at the higher dough
The news called it **k, I called it Diet Coke, oh
At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
F****** plenty b****** while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, floetry
""Say yesâ€ n***** hear the, ""Eghck"" and they know it's me
Make 'em sick to their stomach how they s'posta be
Sippin' on a 50 foot yacht, n****, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where it's s'posta be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm s'posta be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roofs on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning
Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming, ""I'm on my way""
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""
I can't wait for the next n****
From my hood to say, ""Lookout world I'm on my way""
This goes out to my Halites that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nike's, live a hustlers way of life
In white T's, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumpin' that D arm, readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin', stay lookin', over they shoulders
Holdin' them boulders, tryin' to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at 'cha quote, unquote famous rapper
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live
But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, 6 gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
But the judge is saying ""Life"" like it ain't someone's life
Hello new world, here we come
On them twinkie trains, with the hood screaming, ""We're on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming, ""I'm on my way""
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming, ""It's on its way""
I can't wait for the next n****

Yo, what up? What up? This ya man Grinding, from downtown Norfolk
Just want y'all to know it's about time
For us to come up and make a change man
They keep tryin' to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be man
It's about time for us to get it together man
Everybody else get they s*** together
Why the n***** can't get they s*** together and get they money together?
Hustlers come together with hustlers
Know what I'm sayin'? This ain't just for the playas in VA
This for playas all over the world, this grinding
Times a wastin', n***** doin' so much hatin'
Free ya heart and show ya greatness
I like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin' my patience
Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my n***** rise up
Get that money, put them 9s up
Piggy back out the ghetto 'for times up, n***** rush

I'm talkin' you can count it papi it's all there
I'm talkin' cookin' up that 'Slumdog Millionare'
I like them fast girls, who like them fast cars
Who rather sell it to ya than ask for more tomorrow
I know those YSL platforms ain't comin' cheap
And plus I like to show, I gets it from the streets
I'm gettin' dressed like I belong on TV
Settle for less, hell no, that wouldn't be me
Hate now all eyes on me, pay it now I skipped the line for free
Bass loud how it's got to be, hate now all eyes on me
I see your name in lights, your face on the big screen
Let's cruise drop the top you deserve to be seen
Rockin' them Prada goggles, you're my next top model
Your style like Jackie, yo now just sit back and let 'em marvel
I know you see this paper I bet you count my cash
Countless trips to sex with her make Kata Perkin bags
New  let that quench your thirst
Damn right those bitches hate 'cause they just mad you had it first
I'm gettin' dressed like I belong on TV
Settle for less, hell no, that wouldn't be me
Hate now all eyes on me, hate now I skipped the line for free
Bass loud how it's got to be, hate now all eyes on me
Jockin' my swag I'll pop tags, you'll be borrowin'
No drinks in here ya'll thirsty, we be swallowin'
Don't matter where I go those haters be followin' me
So hate now
I know what girls like, know what you lookin' for
Them tights is fittin' right, you hyped them up some more
You pulled that hair back stick, that ass out for them boys to see
You damn near broke your heel from posin' tryin' to catch a G
Gucci, Fendi, Louis, your man don't do that, do he?
Now take the stage, the floor is yours come on let's make a movie
Work that camera mama, rip that runway baby
Now pop yo collar, see them dollar signs is why they hate me
I'm gettin' dressed like I belong on TV
Settle for less, hell no, that wouldn't be me
Hate now all eyes on me, pay it now I skipped the line for free

I ain't in to fat lippin, I'm in to gat grippin
A cat's slippin, is a cat drippin
Why I say that? the cat's slippin, the Mac's spittin
The cat drippin, look in the mirror you's a fat kitten
Puuusssssssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy-ah
(Verse 1 - Pusha T)
All I wanted growing up was remote controls
Now my whole life remote control, hit the block dope control
Got ghetto corners choking slow
Grandmama go to church trying to soak my soul, oh!
This one's for my foes
Find yourself, in a hopeless hole trying to go against him!
I puppet you Pinocchios, flows on strings
It - is what it seems, just call me Jepeto!
A Young Stock Market, put money in your pocket
Cause when Pusha talk it is the object then I drop it
I rose gold ya, huh? pink diamond ya, hah?
Set it in a rhyme now the industry got pink eye
Contagious, flows high demand, like the new Lou Vuitton Monogram
Pastels is cute; How you niggas follow suits so well?
These barrels encompass the heat from +Hell+
Nigga the Franchise of Star Trak sales, uh!
(Chorus)
(Verse 2 - Malice)
They'd rather see me not breathing, than see me achieve
Have my mama grieving, crouched to her knees
Jealous hearted niggas, y'all wear it on ya sleeve
Like a scarlet letter, for the world to see
Can't hide the truth, decendents of pain
So y'all get exposed like the sons of Hussein
My game weight grown, this is no fact
When cats was at hoop, I was Cadillac Brome
I'm not these rap kids, wit childish antics
Who make diss records, who rock hat backwards
These are higher stakes, this is not average weight
This is not pinching penny's bitch, this is carrot cake
This is the difference 'tween rookies and the pros
They pattern after me, they cookie-cut my flow
But so (so, so), I'm never one that be jeal'
Do as I do so I can say, ""Papa raised you well""
(Chorus)
(Verse 3 - Pusha T)
They say the Lord closes windows, to open doors
Nigga don't make me open yours
Seen hearts beat through, open sores
Subliminal rap shit, so immature, that's why I ignore
Punchline niggas on front time, silly hoe shit
He who questions I is unfocused
Copperfield flow yes! I'll make careers disappear
Like hocus - pocus - no joke, it's Push'
(Malice)
Mercy, mercy! Oh Lord who is he?
Who curse me, curse me? But doing me
It hurts me so, puts me through changes
So I got Porsche's and Hummers to deal wit the anguish (oh, oh!)
Acts live, but only if you speak the language
...And the rest is Comic View
Star Trak The Movement, who you pay homage to?
You don't want it with them boys, this I promise you, you pussy!

Death before dishonor, cut by Kitana

Getting fucked by Lana, hoes in the sauna

Arrogant for a reason, s** all season
Two chicks, one dick, the odds are uneven
Niggas die for treason, heart stop beating
Hang em from the lightpoles wintertime, when it's freezing

Got jewellery like I robbed the Sphinx
Got money like I robbed the Brinks truck
Fuck y'all niggas that pray for my ship to sink
I'm a problem, coupes I copped them left to right
The garage looks like the Bat Cave at night
He who tips scales, off that fish scale
Hands gracefully brush them keys like it's brail
Safeties on guns don't sit well
Send new shells to old foes, suckas!
Bail like oh no! flows is so cold
Hoes stick to me like gum to shoe soles huh!
He's vain, 88 you're thinking, 2004 - resurrection of caine!
Here I am, such a young baller
Flow shows promise, like LeBron James
I bring life to the game


Niggas is losing it, out they mothafuckin mind
How another nigga talk about mine, I must be doin it
They must see, a significant rise in my stock
Multi-colored jewels, wit hues of blue in it
Or take you the real estate, where the realest gate
Outline the perimeter, I'll show you where we're doin it
Hear the new, the Clipse is huge
And these crews continue to hate, like Ebenezer Scrooge
But it's cool, I too once, averaged the same
Til I got slick, took risks, carried the 'caine
Then I cooked shit, pushed it, married the game
Now these days, I just 52-karat the chain
I pump base to the projects
I was Tyrannosaurus Rex to the pyrex
These dudes can't wait to see the doom of me
But big deals, so what, what's new, humor me, bitch!


Do-ray-me, fa-so-la-ti
Oh my God, the - wrist stay Rocky like Balboa
The bar's been lowered, here to raise the quota!
Keep guns in pairs, I am the ghetto's Noah!
Nigga need horseshoe for luck
Tryna test a flow like such, jewels like Tut
Children hush, while King Pusha speakin
Or paramedic you'll be seeing fa real

It's every bit what it seems! these is dreams I'm living out
The ride I'm getting out's a fraction of the house
Your living can't obstruct my vision
Franck Mueller jewels, I'm convinced this is living!
It's a given cats gon flap that tongue
Till I appear then cat got tongue, better relax
'Fore I clap that gun, perhaps even collapse that lung
Trust in me that that gat's no fun, one!",https://genius.com/Clipse-stuntin-yall-lyrics
