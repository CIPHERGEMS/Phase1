Friends,Escape,1984.0,"Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– ones we can depend on
Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– before we go any further, let's be
Friends

Is a word we use everyday
Most the time we use it in the wrong way
Now you can look the word up, again and again
But the dictionary doesn't know the meaning of friends
And if you ask me, you know, I couldn't be much help
Because a friend's somebody you judge for yourself
Some are ok, and they treat you real cool
But some mistake your kindness for bein' a fool
We like to be with some, because they're funny
Others come around when they need some money
Some you grew up with, around the way
And you're still real close to this very day
Homeboys through the Summer, Winter, Spring and Fall
And then there's some we wish we never knew at all
And this list goes on, again and again
But these are the people that we call friends

When we first went out together, we barely knew each other
We had no intentions, on becoming lovers
But in no time at all, you became my girl
Me and you, one on one, against the world
Talkin on the telephone for hours at a time
Or else I was at your house, or you was at mine
And then came the arguments and all kinds of problems
Besides making love, we had nothing in common
It could've lasted longer because it started out strong
But I guess we went about the whole thing wrong
'Cause out of nowhere it just came to an end
Because we became lovers before we were friends

Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– ones we can depend on
Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– before we go any further, let's be
Friends

You say you and your girlfriend were so tight
You took her out with you and your guy one night
She even had a set of keys to your home
And you shared mostly everything you owned
But as she shook your hand, she stole your man
And it was done so sweet, it had to be a plan
Couldn't trust her with cheese, let alone your keys
With friends like that you don't need enemies
You wonder how long it was all going on
And you’re still not sure if you’re glad he’s gone
You say, well if she took him he was never mine
But deep inside you know that's just another lie
And now you're kinda cold toward people you meet
'Cause of something that was done to you by some creep
But nevertheless, I'll say it again
That these are the people that we call friends

Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– ones we can depend on
Friends ‎– how many of us have them?
Friends ‎– before we go any further, let's be

Freaks Come Out At Night,Escape,1984.0,"The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Discos don't open till after dark
And it ain't till twelve till the party really starts
And I always had to be home by ten
Right before the fun was about to begin
Crowds of people lined up inside and out
Just one reason, to rock the house
But in the day time the streets were clear
You couldn't find a good freak anywhere, cause

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Now when freaks get dressed to go out at night
They like to wear leather jackets, chains and spikes
They wear rips and zippers all in their shirts
Real tight pants and fresh mini skirts
All kinds of colors runnin' through their hair
And you could just about spot a freak anywhere
But then again, you could know someone all their life
But might not know they're a freak unless you see them at night, cause

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night

Now the party's jumpin', the place is packed
And when the crowd's like this, I'm ready to rap
But before I could bust a rhyme on the mic
Freaks are all over me like white on rice
Freaks come in all shapes, sizes and colors
But what I like about 'em most is that they're real good lovers
They do it in the park, they do it in the dark
But most freaks are known for breakin' hearts
You could never tell what a freak was thinkin' of
And you may never catch a freak without at least one glove
And they don't walk, when they step, they strut
And nine times out of ten they drive you nuts
But take my advice, you don't stand a chance
Freaks are so bad they got their own dance
So if you wanna live a nice quiet life
Do yourself a favor, don't come out at night, cause

The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night
(the freaks come out)
The freaks come out at night
Hut one, hut two
Hut hut hut

I’m a Ho,Back In Black,1986.0,"I'm ready
(here we go)
Yo, Donkey?
(Yo whassup man?)
Yo what's happening tonight, man?
(I'm goin' to check out a few skeezers over there, know what I’m saying?)
Yo, man I seen a lot of skeezers in this place tonight, man
(I know I'm ready to do the wild thing, know what I’m saying?)
(And, and, and, it goes a little something like this)

Some say it's an art, some say it's a shame
You would give me your body, before your name
But I'm a jigga-high, and I'm a gigolo
I'm a jigga wherever it can go
So later on don't act like you don't know
When I pick out the freaks in the front row
I'm the rapper J, that's the rapper Ex
We're known for playing tag team sex
When I get you in the house, you know what I do
Well, let me tell you a story that's definitely true
When I came to the party I was by myself
Nine times out of ten I'll leave with someone else
It's something about the way I rock the microphone
The ladies in the place wanna take me home
Stretch me out all along the couch
And show me what good lovin' is all about
So when I get 'em, then I let 'em
I throw my jimmy on the top and then I wet 'em

'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
How do you know, because I told you so

Now the lover of many I just may be
But I'll never touch another man's property
So if you got a little momma, you wanna keep her neat
Then keep the little freak off my street
Because if she comes knocking at my door
It's my duty to give her what she came here for
What can I say? That's the life I live
Now how's your wife and my kid

'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
How do you know, because I told you so

Now if I knock on your door you should open it up
You wanna know who it is, the neighborhood slutbuster
Been rocking freaks, all through the week
Now when I say freaks, I mean the ones with the sneaks
I mean the ones with the nerve, the ones with the guts
To call me a ho when they're giving it up
So I think it's about time you all learned a lesson
Slutbusters is our new profession

'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
I rock three different freaks after every show
'Cause I'm a ho, you know I'm a ho
How do you know, because I told you so

A-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dick-what?
A-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dicky-dick-who?

Now if knock on your door, you should open it up
You wanna know who it is, the neighborhood slutbuster
Been rocking freaks, all through the week
Now when I say freaks, I mean the ones with the sneaks

Five Minutes of Funk,Escape,1984.0,"Now the party didn't start 'til I walked in
And I probably won't leave until the thing ends
But in the mean time, the in between time
If you work your thing, then I'll work mine
We came here together so we could have fun
Me and you baby, goin' one on one
Now this is the last chance for us to get off
So either get loose, or you aught to get lost
'Cause I'm just about ready to do my thing
'Cause I'm the stone cold, New York, Rap Machine
I'ma give you what I got, and baby that's plenty
And never has one man rocked so many
I'ma make you wet and make you sweat
Just to see how funky you can get
Now when I'm on the mic, I do serve well
And I go by the name of the Rapper Jalil
*Four minutes left*
Now sit back, relax, put on your head gear
Get ready for a trip through the Atmosphere
Gonna take you for a ride through the Twilight Zone
I don't need a space ship, I use my microphone
So hold on tight, with all your might
'Cause Ill be rappin' like this for the rest of the night
Its Jalil, yo, your master rapper
And when I'm on the mic its a sheer disaster
'Cause MC's crumble when we rumble
Some think I'm soft just because I'm humble
So all you MC's, I hope you're real good listeners
'Cause in this battle, I'm takin' no prisoners
I'm slayin' MC's right on the spot
'Cause I'm the the master of the Rap, the doctor of the Rock
The Jack of all Trades, The Master of One
And the thing I master is called havin' fun
We got three minutes left to rock this funk
To separate the good stuff from the junk, so
Get in the groove, and feel the sound
And once you're inside, spread yourself around
From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
Come on Master Dee and get funky while we got em
*Three minutes left*
Me and my partner, from the start
We usually get together, after dark
Sometimes to rap, sometimes to sing
In the Summer or the Winter cause it ain't no thing
And ever since I first came 'round
Side by side, we'd throw down
We came here to this here place
To serve you all right to your face
Because this jam here is our show stopper
We didn't wanna use it but I guess we gotta
We're the men of the hour, makin' the ladies scream and holler
Too hot to trot, too sweet to be sour
I'm gonna set the record straight
And I hope that it is not too late
If you want the best, I won't settle for less
Put your money on me, I'm your best bet
Come on
One for the treble
Two for the Bass
Three for the ladies
Four for the plaid
Five, minutes of funk, this ain't no junk
So pull your bottom off the tree stump
Ladies real pretty, from city to city
But now we're gettin' down to the nitty gritty
From the bottom to the top, the top to the bottom
*Two minutes left*
I'm gonna rock em, while I still got em
Our rappin' shower has style and power
And this, is our disco hour
I don't know what all of you have heard
So it's up to me to spread the word
About the man that we feel has got to be real
Our crowned Prince on the wheels of steel
He goes by the name of Grandmaster Dee
So if its alright with you, its alright with me
We gonna rock you people's minds with ease
With some help from the Maestro, if you please

One Love,Back In Black,1986.0,"From the L to the O and the V to the E
The L... the O... and the V... the E
Love... love... love

The words love and like both have four letters
But they’re two different things altogether
'Cause I've liked many ladies in my day
But just like the wind they've all blown away
See to love someone is an atmosphere
That you both still share when one's not there
There's no real way it can be explained
I guess it's the way I smile when I hear your name
It's the little things you do that mean so much
It's the care that you put into every touch
It's the way I trust you, and you trust me
I guess some of us are so lucky

I was known for having the upper hand
I was known as a stone cold ladies' man
If it wasn't for you, I'd be that way still
But lately there's a change in Jalil
Though my friends play games, and tease me a lot
I know I'm more than happy with what I got
When I get up in the morning, and go to work
See all day long I stay alert
Until we come home at night, and close the doors
Two people sharing one common cause
When I say one love, you can trust me
'Cause never have I been so lucky

One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love

Now the love I used to have just left me cold
I used to buy her everything from diamonds to gold
At first I thought she'd left me 'cause I didn't buy her enough
But then she left me a note along with all my stuff
Said ""Maybe one of these days you'll have to learn
That love is something that you gotta earn
And once you earn it gotta know how to keep it
You got to want it as well as you need it""
To have lost love was a hurtin' lesson
But to have had love was a definite blessing
And I know what the Beatles were thinking of
When they said that money can't buy me love

When you say lost love, what do you mean?
I just went through the exact same thing
Mind was lost for a whole different reason
I lost my love because of cheatin'
Started goin' through the streets all day and night
I guess greedy best describes such an appetite
I wish I had her back, but it remains a wish
I guess a bird in the hand beats two in the bush
I'd like to thank you girl for teaching me love
Because all in all I had a ball
Guess it's better to have loved and to have lost
Then to never have loved at all

One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love

Now I think it's 'bout time that we break it down
This is all about the love that we lost and found
About the love that we missed, and the love we shared
About the love that just up and disappeared
About who's was for real and who was fake
So you can learn from our mistakes

'Cause it was already written, done and said
So you can stay two steps ahead
The L is for the love which you give
The O is for the one who we live
And the V is for the vibrant letter
The E means may we last forever

One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one love
One love, one love
You're lucky just to have just one",https://genius.com/Whodini-one-love-lyrics
Big Mouth,Escape,1984.0,"A big mouth, a big mouth!
There’s a rumor bein’ spread about me and the crew
About somethin’ we did or supposed to do
You might not have heard it or maybe you have
But when I first heard it all I did was laugh
I used to get angry and all uptight
But you could say what you want, just spell my name right
‘Cause all I’m ever guilty of is rockin’ the house
But that’s not what the rumor was all about
Now if you like me then tell all your friends
And if you don’t wait until you see me again
This way I could hear it from the horse's mouth
And right then and there we could straighten it out
Because I don’t get involved with he said, she said
So take my advice and quit while you’re ahead
Because one day I might not laugh
The day your mouth writes the check your behind can’t cash
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth!
People used to say that you had a big mouth
And now I understand what they’re talkin’ about
Because what we do is just between me and you
Not somethin’ that you run and tell your crew
But you had to tell Sharon and she told Carol
Then the story rolled on just like a wheel barrel
Carol told Dee Dee and she told Pam
And Pam was overheard talkin’ to her man
Pam was told Cookie what she thought she heard
And somehow Easy E had got the word
He told somebody I knew from uptown
And they called me up and put me down
Now the whole darn story’s been changed around
And that’s the reason why I’m not with you now
Because you never shoulda opened your mouth at all
And I wouldn’t have no reason to make this call
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth!
Now you’re the Don Dapper of the neighborhood
And every time I see you you’re up to no good
You’re just like a snake crawlin’ on the ground
Lookin’ for some new dirt to spread around
Then you stick out your tongue and start spreadin’ lies
And now somebody else has been victimized
You may stop for a while, then you’re at it again
And you always got to have the last word in
They call your mouth almighty, tongue everlastin’
You ain’t satisfied unless somethin’s happenin’
You don’t have to be there no more than a minute
But you always got to have your two cents in it
So to all you big mouths this jam’s for you
Some’in’ else you could run and go tell your crew
‘Cause we made to be big so we could rock the house
But we also made it big enough to fit in your mouth!
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth!
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
You got a big mouth, a big mouth
A big mouth!",https://genius.com/Whodini-big-mouth-lyrics
Funky Beat,Back In Black,1986.0,"Extra, extra read all about it
Whodini drops another one in everybody's face
And dig it, they call this one Grandmaster Dee's ""Funky Beat""
Film at 11

Funky beat, funky beat
Funky beat, funky beat, funky beat
Funky beat, funky beat, funky beat

Right here and now, I do declare
This to be the new funky beat of the year
If you want a funky beat, why not use mine?
I be rocking funky beats, all the time
So now's the time, and this is the chance
Cause the next record might not make you dance
Cause funk ain't nothing but a four letter word
That's often spelled but seldom heard
Listen to the bass drum hit the ground
The bass sounds like it weighs at least a pound
You heard the drum roll, there was a glare in your eye
But tell me the truth, are you that surprised?
We make beats with rhythm and rhythm with beats
Hear my records in the clubs, as well as the streets
So to all you emcees, that's looking for an idol
Jalil is my name, Master Rapper's my title

This beat here will be served and deserved
We'll rock on point, and turn all curves
We'll rock every beat with the greatest of ease
And if you try and drum roll us - we'll bob and weave
We'll slip and slurk, tear off our shirt
Just to show you what it's like when a rapper's at work
So from now until the man who we feel
Is gonna go rocking on the wheels of steel
Grandmaster Dee, hit me!

Funky beat, funky beat, funky beat
Funky beat, funky beat, funky beat

Now you heard DJ's on the record scratch
But how many have you heard bust a rap?
My DJ, Grandmaster Dee
He raps on the mic with Ecstasy and me
And when we're at the party, we turn it out
Cause that's what Whodini is all about
I am the rapper that they call Jalil
Master Dee is the one on the wheels of steel
Behind the turntable, one and two
Something from Whodini, special for you (yo)
You (yo) you (yo) you (yo) you (yo)
You, you, you, yo' Drew!

Yo last 
Fresh Fest
 I was rockin ""Good Times""
This Fresh Fest I'm busting out rhymes
When I'm on the set I take total control
I rock your mind, yo' feet, your body, your soul
Other DJs may stop and stare
But when I'm on the set, I show no fear
I rock the beat because it is bad
Jam the other the DJs know that I am
Def, def, def, def, yo Ex!

The point we tried to make, is simple
On the turntables he's quick and nimble
Since he's here we're gonna prove our point
Now that Whodini's inside the joint
Born and raised in the streets of Brooklyn
There are three of us, and we're all good looking
Young ladies hearts, we're sho' to win
Cause like five plus five we equal ten
So easy on the tweeter, heavy on the bass
With some help from Master Dee we're gonna rock
My time is up, it's on you Jalil

All DJs aren’t created equal
To this rap there will be no sequel
People like you must understand
That all rap groups don't need no band
All we need in order to achieve
Is some help from the Master you better believe
And you'll get results, and not insults
And that's the way our business is dealt

The words we speak are so explicit
We rock from the Atlantic to the Pacific
We're the men with the international beeper
But call us at night because our rates are cheaper
And it's our intent to represent
The DJ that'll give you one hundred percent
Mo' excitement than a one man band
Too good to be great so we call the man Grand
Master Dee
Ooh-wee! (9x)

Haunted House Of Rock,Whodini,1983.0,"Welcome to the place where all the creatures meet
The last building to your left on a dead-end street
You'll find skeleton bones outside on the pavement
And torture chambers down in the basement
Cobwebs hangin' over your head
And music bein' played by the Grateful Dead
And spinnin' on the turntables back to back
Is no other than my main man wolfman Jack
The M.C. of the night rappin' to the tunes
Was the creature from the black lagoon
There's a sign on the door that can't be missed
It reads: ""Enter... But at your own risk""
'Cause people seen reported goin' in the haunted house
But never again seen comin' out
You ask me if it's true
I'll leave it up to you
Here's an invite
I hope I see you tonight

We sent out invitations for weeks and weeks
We invited in all kinds of creeps
Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
The Addams family and the monster five
The invisible man
Where could he be? We know he got inside the party free
One of these days they're gonna catch him red-handed
If not for sneakin' in free
For being a booty bandit
The bartender was cute
But kinda hairy
And Dracula was killin' those Bloody Marys
He got drunk as a skunk
And started trouble all night
But everybody knew his bark was bigger than his bite
It was the only place for you to be
The first 200 witches in the party were free
And all was well until the clock struck 12
Everybody jumped up and started raisin' hell

They were screaming
They were breakin'
They were foaming at the mouth
Just minor side effects of the haunted house
You'll have haunted dreams all in your sleep
You'll be tossin' and turnin' to the funky beat
Frankenstein was there with some crazy looking chick
I think she said her name was ""Voodoo on a stick""
She had a big fat head and a skinny body
I wouldn't be caught with her alone
There is none at a party
Igor was there with the monster crew
I seen everybody there except you
Why didn't you come?
Weren't you prepared?
Or could it be that you were scared?
It's just not fair that you couldn't be there
Because you really missed a lot, I'm tellin' you
We really brought the place down at the haunted house of rock!",https://genius.com/Whodini-haunted-house-of-rock-lyrics
Escape (I Need a Break),Escape,1984,"Escape, gotta get away
I need a break, gotta get away
I left my house this morning on my way to work
Some lady on the train spilled coffee on my shirt
And people started laughing like the whole thing was funny
I woulda went home except I need the money
'Cause times is hard, my boss is crazy
The guy that works with me he's so damn lazy
Sits around all day drinks coffee and tea
He expects all the work to be done by me
And sometimes I wonder what they hired me for
To operate computers or run to the store
And when I ask for a raise, they tell me be patient
I've been working three years without a damn vacation
Things could be better but they're gettin' worse
Until I got this job I never used to curse
Well, I've had it up to here with people treating me wrong
Somebody tell the DJ to play my song!
Escape, gotta get away
I need a break, gotta get away
I buy a lottery ticket every chance I get
And if I hit I got someplace my boss can kiss
My friends are backstabbing so I hang out alone
Think it's crazy on my job it's no better at home
My girl's half-mad, she drives me wild
All she ever cares about is rippin' the styles
She wants diamonds, furs, and now she wants kids
But what she needs is somewhere else to live
My psychiatrist tells me to give her more time
But one more second might blow my mind
The pressure's building up on me more and more
It's gotten so I'm doing things I've never done before
I need a break, y'all, I can't take this place
I feel locked up and I wanna escape
And I wanna escape, and I wanna escape, escape, escape, escape, escape, escape! escape, escape
So you wanna leave your job, but you need the funds
Take a sick day off and find another one
And if your girl or your man ain't treatin' you right
Just the same buncha headaches night after night
Don't go crazy trying to please somebody else
You don't owe them a thing but you owe it yourself
So do what you gotta in order to escape
Take it from me it's never too late
'Cause I'm breaking these chains I may never come back
Going to go out and give myself a rap attack
And if I like it a lot I'm going to make it a double
And if you stand in my way you're looking for trouble
There's only one way for me to have peace
And that's for me to go out and rock the beat, ha
So turn up the highs, boost up the bass
Come on everybody let's rock the place!

Magic’s Wand,Whodini,1982.0,"Oh my God, I think I'm having a rap attack

Somebody get a doctor!
Quick, man
She's having an attack!

She said “Rap attack"", man, not “Heart attack”

Oh, you mean she's alright then, right?

Of course, man
You never heard of a Mr. Magic Rap Attack?
Where is this guy from, man?

Oh, I heard of a heart attack or a Big Mac attack
But what's a rap attack?

Come here, man, I see I'ma
Have to explain it to you like this
See, a rap attack means

Deejays jammin' in the street
MC's rappin' to the beat
The people downstairs sayin' they can't sleep
'Cause the people upstairs are stompin' their feet
It's not like they're startin' a riot
“We'll call the cops, 'cause we want some quiet!”
There's no need for them to get excited
They're just mad because they're not invited
(It's all in Mr. Magic's Wand)

Oh see, now I understand what a rap attack is

Well, it's about time!

All you had to do is explain it to me
But let me ask you a question:
“How long have they been rockin' like this?”

Well, rapping's always been around
(Well, it says that it's big time now)
Every neighborhood had its own crew
(That meant you against me) and me against you
(They would jam every weekend at the neighborhood center)
And charge a small price for the crowds to enter
(The parties would be packed inside and out)
To see who was best at rockin' the house
(It's all in Mr. Magic's Wand)

Then Magic went on the radio
And everybody said: “What a way to go!”
The moment he went on the air
It was plain to see a new phase was here
He started out playing mostly rap
Then they all said: “Nobody's into that”
Well, they all turned out to be wrong
Cause rappin' on the mike had caught on strong
Some still say it's not what's happenin'
After 'Rapper's Delight' went triple platinum
The record world was in for a smash
Sugarhill, Kurtis Blow, to Grandmaster Flash
Blondie, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie
They even made a rapper out of me
In no time at all, a star was born
And I think he owes it all to his Magic Wand

Now that you heard our rap and you caught a contact
(And by now you're all to be blasted)
We want you all to know that we got to go
(But it was big fun while it lasted)
Hey y'all, but we'll be back again, so tell all your friends
(Good things don't always come to an end)
With somethin' innovative (To rock you all well)
From Ecstasy (And the Rapper Jalil)",https://genius.com/Whodini-magics-wand-lyrics
Be My Lady,Six,UnKnown,"Yo these niggas ain't ready for this

I can't wait to get it on
I can't wait to get it on
I can just feel it

Whodini, 96, so so def... smooth shit

Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me
(Be my lady)

I can just hear it

Why don't you why don't you why don't you

Somebody, somebody, somebody calling me
It started as a small thing
Like me watching you walk
Damn she looks good
But that's the way niggas talk
So at first it didn't phase me
Just another lady
Walked by looking fly
Catch my eye
Now usually I could see two to three to look fine
At a later time neither one is on my mind
But not with you baby
Something's crazy
Tell me what it is
Tell me why baby you make me feel like this
I've only seen you one time
But in my mind it's like a million
Never met you but want you to have my children
Right by my side through thick and thin
I see you not just as my lover but my best friend to the end
I hope to see you again so I could let you know
How I feel and what the deal is from the door
Thought I was slipping but you fit the description to a T
Of a woman I need so I wanna know
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
In too many spots around time
I ain't got lock down
Never had a steady woman cause I like to get around
Out of the crew
I was the one who never talked about tying the knot
I couldn't see it, I couldn't see me getting got
Until I bumped heads with you
All the things I talked about not doing
Now I'm ready to do
The dance floor was the location
I saw you, you saw me
And then I started my transformation
Casing out every little thing you do
I watched you and how you make all your moves
Contemplating my approach
Take it easy or be agressive
I take two to make sure you get the message
Got my beverage and I proceeded as planned
Me letting you know how I wanna be your man
And even though I don't know you
I feel I do so
Believe me when I tell you
Cause what I feel is true, so
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
What it gonna take to get next to you
Tell you some good shit and have sex with you
Show you nothing about me's shady
And I'd love it if you be my lady
(Come on baby, come on baby, I said come on girl)

Somebody's calling for me
See I'm wise enough to know when someone's yearning for me, lady
Can I sing it again?
See I'm wise enough to know when your body's yearing for me, yes I am

Rap Machine,Whodini,1983.0,"Look out, world; stand aside, MCs
Cause I'm a definite threat to society
My name is Ecstasy and I'ma tell you what
For me to get down, you've got to get up
With the pep in my step and Jalil by my side
I've got the ladies yellin' ""Ride, Whodini, ride!""
My work ain't hard, my boss ain't mean
Cause Ecstasy's kickin' like a rap machine
You know I heard this story just the other night
They built a computer that could rock a mic
A computer whose rap was always right
A rapper with built-in disco lights
A MC that could last for years and years
A rapper that all MCs would fear
I finally finished my MC king
Let me introduce you all to the rap machine

I am the rap machine
May I rap with you?
No, you can't
I am the disco dream
The rhyme machine, the rapping— Drop that...
They have computers that read, computers that write
And now they're tryin' to make one to rock the mic
But never ever in your wildest dreams
Could my rap be replaced by a tin machine
Because rap is somethin' that is in the heart
And you know it's there right from the start
Looks good on paper, but picture that
A computer that could duplicate my rap
You know, some people won't give science a chance
My rap machine would be so advanced
A rapper that had a computer's mind
A MC who didn't steal other rapper's rhymes
A rapper that never ran out of breath
A computer whose rap was always fresh
Now that's what I call a MC king
Nobody can compete with my rap machine

Right about now on the microphone
It's the rap machine and I rock it on, rock it on, rock it on
Cause that's what the rap machine is all about
Don't you know that the rap machine, rap machine, rap machine is in the house
I said all the people in the place to be, the place to be
The one to see, I will MC
I will  your fantasy
A, a real MC
A, a real MC
E, E, reprogram, reprogram, reprogram
Let me cast the first stone
In an attempt to tickle your funny bone
Cause if you want the best, you won't settle for less
Put your money on me; I'm your best bet
Cause I'm a natural-born rapper, I could rock all night
Hey Ecstasy, stop doggin' the mic
You say your rap is strong, but your words are wrong
Take my advice: just move along
At first you had so much lip
Now please don't think you can mess with this
Cause I'm just about ready to do my thing
I'm a stone-cold New York rap machine
With the bass in your face, the highs in your eyes
Just a little somethin' to keep you energized
 in the place to be
I'm the rap machine, on the M-I-C
Because this is what our party's like
When the rap machine is up on the mic
All the young ladies get a big delight
While the fake MCs sit back and bite
Cause I'm the disco king, electronic whiz
The master of the rock, the human beatbox
The show stopper, the party rocker
The disco dream, the rap machine
All you MCs look what I mean
To the party people in the place to be
Nuclear family repeat after me
Let me hear somebody say
Let me hear you say rap machine
Everybody now, (rap machine)
Say rap machine
Everybody now, (rap machine)
You know we get on til the break of dawn
The rap machine, he's rockin' on
Say the hip hop, the hibbie, the hibbie hibbie
Hip hip hop, you don't stop your rockin' baby
Baw, to the baw, the bang a dang baby
The shiggidy bop a bang baby baby
Hip, hop, the hibbie, the hop, the hop
The hop hop diddy bop bop
'Til the rap machine just disco master
I keep it on, keep it keep it on
Keep it on, keep it on, keep it on
A sucker MCs runnin' home
Say onnnnn and onnnnnn
Rap machine, let me hear you say it
Somebody say rap machine, let me hear you say it
Somebody say rap
Machine, everybody now
Rap machine
Let me hear you say rap machine",https://genius.com/Whodini-rap-machine-lyrics
Growing Up,Back In Black,1986.0,"Chorus (1)
It’s all just a part of growing up
Things are gonna be hard, but don’t give up
It’s all just a part of growing up
And we like to wish you all the best of luck
(Ecstasy)
Now growing up is a hell of a job
The pay is good but the work is hard
Sometimes you feel like you wanna quit
And that’s when you remember this
(Jalil)
There ain't nothing new, under the sun
What’s you doing now’s already been done
Fifth period, I did the same as you
I used to play cards in my lunchroom too
(Ecstasy)
Now I used to cut class hanging out in the hall
I tipped my hat to the side cold playin the wall
Because smoking in school was a against the rules
So I did not smoke and I still was cool
(Jalil)
Now you get yours just like I got mine
Wanna see you there at graduation time
Fight your battles, don’t ever run
Cause you win some and then you lose some
CHORUS (1)
(Ecstasy) Tell no more (?),(Jalil) Blind man’s bluff
(Ecstasy)
That’s just what it’s like when you’re growing up
(Jalil)
These games I used to play as a kid
Describe exactly the way I lived
(Ecstasy)
Run catch and kiss was a game I played
But losing you was a mistake that I made
I tried to have my cake and eat it too
I guess that’s why you did what you had to do
(Jalil)
Sometimes, you got to be down and out
Before you can understand what it’s all about
I guess really, to understand the story
You got to feel the pain as well as the glory
(Ecstasy)
And now that the shoe is on the other foot
I really don’t like the way that it looks
(Ecstasy and Jalil)
It took us a while but we understand now
That what comes around also goes around
Chorus (2)
It’s all just a part of growing up
Things are gonna be hard, but don’t give up
It’s all just a part of growing up
When you get to the point when you get fed up
CHORUS (1)
(Jalil)
When I was 10, I used to say I was 12
When I turned 15 I was bad as hell
When I was18 I was hanging out freakin’
I was cool at 18 no longer a delinquent
(Ecstasy)
I used to go to clubs with fake I.D
Who you laughin’ at you did the same as me
Sometimes they’d let me in
Sometimes they’d put me out
I guess that’s what growing up was all about
(Jalil)
About phases and changes and re-arranges
Growing up these days is getting dangerous
(Ecstasy)
Too many people taking not enough giving
I’m just an average man just trying to make a living
(Jalil)
And I don’t have to tell you that it’s hard as hell
But this is my life and I live it well
And when I get fed up all I do is shout
“I may be down but I’m not knocked out!”

Can’t Get Enough,Six,UnKnown,"I put the helmet on my mic and tackle MC's
I break backs of fat tracks and freeze
And get up on these, and hit your knees
Trick, can do what you do, they call me Peter
Oh, you ain't feelin me? I ain't feelin yo ass either
Now if you know this shit when you hear
Drop your blunt and your beer
And put your hands up in the air
Then I steer the 600 and flex through your hood
I get your money or girl, I take your car, then I'm good
Call me the rap killer, thriller, loungin in my villa
I'm chocolate inside, but on the outside vanilla
The darker the berry, they say the juice is mo' sweet
But it's 2 dollars more, bitch, if you want white meat
Now I - never lost a battle in my life
God came close, and yo, I beat Jesus twice
I take it to your block, your party, and do my thing
Cause I don't give a shit how you niggas wanna swing

You can get touched, cause none wanna mess with us
I call your bluff, cause y'all just be actin' tough
You get bust, cause competition talks too much
I know it's rough, but y'all still can't get enough

You might think I'm one of those men who couldn't keep they woman in check
But all respect to the Ecs passin checks while you're payin for sex
You take her out, you buy her things, you bring her flowers
Come home, and she's with Ecstasy up in the shower
Now picture that, now you wanna get your gat
But I keep a strap, so get your shit exact, I got my shit intact
And it's a fact that Jalil got my back at the face of trouble
Get in that ass on the double, we blown like a bubble
Shovelin' and buryin' our way up out to rubble, half heart half humble
So all expenses paid as I'm headin up this platinum road
I'm out to get it, you can keep your gold
I got an album full of rocks
Good luck to all the labels on lock
In '96 Whodini's callin the shots
It takes two to play this game, but three makes it better
Master Dee, Jalil and Ecstasy, we here forever

You can get touched, cause none wanna mess with us
I call your bluff, cause y'all just be actin tough
You get bust, cause competition talks too much
I know it's rough, but y'all still can't get enough

I can get swift as if I was Mario Andretti
Mastermind, my crime time and rhymes keep steady
But I'm quite ready, rhymes cut like Freddy, now
Give me a mic and a crowd, I'm quite deadly, how
Tariq, hypnotizin when I'm comin out your equalizer
Flee me when you see me, that would be wiser
I know you wanna be me, ridin in my coupe
As I ride by I see you sittin on your stoop
Lookin' funny with no money, but no cash, no honey
I was told you can pay to make your rainy day sunny
It's the money in my life
Allowin' me to get all that honey from your wife
Yeah, she's tall, slim and trife
Sharp like a knife, yet dull like a Sunday
I met her on Monday and fucked her on Monday
That's one way to know that money comes and goes
And so do freaks and hoes, that's why I don't trust em
I lust for them, but I gots no love for them
In the winter, I don't got a glove for them
So I keep a steady pace in this race for these ladies
I got her on tape drinkin Bailey's on gravy

You can get touched, cause none wanna mess with us
I call your bluff, cause y'all just be actin tough
You get bust, cause competition talks too much
I know it's rough, but y'all still can't get enough

I'm smooth as a Lexus, yet I ride rugged like a jeep
It's the rapper Jalil, money, that's creepin in your sleep
Call me Freddy, except I'm smooth, black, long and steady
Ecstasy pass the mic, cause my rap time's ready
Now who wanna swing it? Don't even sing it
It's party time, put your hands up, players, bring it
I lounge with the big boys, sippin Crystal
And when the music stops, find me in the hotel
All my dime pieces in the back, where you at?
I got the fatment, plus this rap shit keeps me stacked
Fly me on a plane to Jermaine, good lookin
Atlanta, for representin Brooklyn, you shook, and
I'm So So Def, and yet I'm so so smooth
Give me a mic and a beat, and watch this blackman move
Takin it to another level, flippin my steez
So get up on these and pass them trees if you please

You can get touched, cause none wanna mess with us
I call your bluff, cause y'all just be actin tough
You get bust, cause competition talks too much
I know it's rough, but y'all still can't get enough

And we don't stop

Do It Again,Raiders of the Lost Art Compilation,UnKnown,"Whodini, launchin' rockets in the 90s!
Now I remember in the days of way back
With just a 4-track
With no SP-12 to make tracks
Wearing leather suits and boots was the gear
Of fly bands and hip hop stars of the year
""Hey-ho"" when rockin' on the street was the show
When the people clapped but they went home with no dough
Sportin' All Star walking to the beat of the Funky Four + 1
And the awesome Treacherous Three
Bump it in your Walkman, the music was explodin'
But these are The Breaks from the king Kurtis Blow
And giving us The Message is Grandmaster Flash, The Fearless Four
But still they said that rap won't last
Radio was playin' it, street kids were sayin' it
Soulsonic Force had the funk and they were bringing it
Then we threw the Whodini sound in the crew
With Magic Wand, had it going on (Old school)
Bringing the freaks out at night, Rapper's Delight
Fly girls were giving hip hop a new light
Pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due and remember that time repeats itself
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Let's do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Now check it out
I remember in the days when we wore gold chains
And leisure suits, Adidas and Pumas with no strings
And boppin' to The Rap Attack
Run-DMC was hittin' everywhere with Rock Box
The inner-city was complimentin' Big Mouth
One Love, and Friends
The Five Minutes of Funk, those days will never end
The Dynamix would break and all over town
All over the world, hip hop came and made its rounds
Taking up the fresh cuts, 1, 2, and 3
That was Whodini and Run-DMC
Lookin' at the kids with boomboxes on their shoulders
Sheepskins, Gazelles, leather bombers lookin' bolder
Then LL and Rakim came to life
One for makin' us dance, the other insight
The fans was getting bigger, look what we delivered
You still think that rap is gonna die, how do you figure?
Every time you say it's gonna pass
Hip-hop comes out with another style of rap and slaps your ass
Boogie Down Production, Biz and Public Enemy
DJs The Red Alert and Magic gave us energy
Tour and tour and show after show
And everybody freaked when Marley Marl had control
And pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due, remember that time repeats itself
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Let's do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
(You know we got a...) reputation
Do it, do it, do it
Do it, do it, do it
I'm thinkin' of today's sound and how it all changed
To hear it on the radio, no longer in the game
Videos just get me depressed
Well I guess a 9 to 5 isn't a way to end my quest
I see mad MCs with fat raps and 
Thinkin' if Whodini could ever compete with that
Little kids rockin' on the mic 
Whatever happened to the nameplates of funky fresh era?
Then I see Run-DMC comin' back
Old school MCs become the new school styles of rap
Like Naughty by Nature, Leaders of the New
A Tribe Called Quest, Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy too
Red Alert keepin' it street for the core
Of hard rocks, respect to you Red and many more
Awesome Two paved the way thru and thru
Thanks to all the DJs keeping it real and true
We used to be on the outside lookin' in
Now Whodini is comin' back to do it all again
Pioneers who've given rap its life and itself
All praise due and notice that time repeated itself!

Fugitive,Back In Black,1986.0,"To the highest degree, in quality!
In our rap technology ladies and gentlemen I am the rapper Ecstasy!
And standing to my side, this is my partner, the master rapper Jalil
Behind us on the 1 and 2, Grandmaster Dee, do-do-doin' the do
And it goes a little something like this
It's true my friends who said they saw
My poster hanging up on the wall
The pictures clear there's no mistake
My video plays in every state
Well I didn't do a thing, I ain't got no kids
And they labeled me a fugitive
I ain't got no time to spend locked up
Cause I'm ridin' high on lady luck
Things could be better, I know they could
But you gotta take the bad along with the good
I'm one of many on a list
And I want you to acknowledge this
Well, things got heavy and that's a fact
So I've pulled a disappearing act
So, until things simmer down
I'm gonna do my thing underground
Presto, zesto, alakazam!
Never mind where I was, this is where I am
And right here and now before your very eyes
I will definitely do what others dared to try
Let me break it down for you and stop all confusion
The microphone's the only thing I'll be using
Now the names Whodini but I'm no magician
See I came to this party 'cause I'm on a mission
I've been meaning to talk to you face to face
'Cause if it wasn't for you I wouldn't be in the place
When it comes to making money I don't waste time
My brother I said please I'll be in front of the line
'Cause I was taught the early bird always catches the worm
And a lesson well taught is a lesson well learned
That's why I'm on the move and everything's alright
And the clothes I need to wear were prepared last night
'Cause if I let you get ahead of me, you'll know you instead of me
When opportunity knocks, I've gotta be ready see?
He who hesitates is lost and the price that you pay is called the cost
When they said money maker, they must have meant me
To make money and time you need a M and a E
'Cause time is money and money is time
You might waste yours, but I'm rocking mine
So rock on!
Look here!
When your money takes over like Grover, you ain't worth your weight in gold
All you need to getcha through is a good ol' fashion roll
Just like Batman's on his way in the nick of time to save the day
These people are wishing upon a star and guys like us driving in big cars
So we pledge allegiance to the rhyme
To rhyme to every beat on time
And to our public to which we love
To show everybody what there really was
So united we stand, divided we fall
We're not the first but were still here y'all!
We're your best bet 'cause you can't get
A better show for your TV set
'Cause we're the ones who rock at your request
We're the ones to call if you want the best
The ones that'll zap you with the super blast
With jams from the present and hits from the past
Hey, you never know what we're gonna do next
So don't waste your time, don't try to guess
'Cause we're the one and only masters of the ceremony
Guaranteed to rock the house, definitely not a phony!
Now, those days are gone and I'm on the move
'Cause I ain't got nothing to prove
I've got a summons a day, for a year or less
They even got a warrant out for my arrest
'Cause I'm a fugitive and I'm on the run
And my line of work? that's number one
My best friend in the world is not a dog, boy or girl
My only friend in this world I know is my portable TV radio
So when we get up, out and on the go, we always travel in stereo
Because after I've put a town to use
I look back and see who's got the juice?
And when things finally simmer down
They won't have me to kick around!",https://genius.com/Whodini-fugitive-lyrics
Be Yourself,Open Sesame,UnKnown,"Grandmaster Dee
If you please

Be yourself

I’m not rocking this jam to insult nobody
This one goes out to the carbon copies
So take a stand, as quick as ya can
If ya plan ain’t working then change that plan
If you wanna be a loser, that’s up to you
Just don’t be a loser ‘round me and my crew
Before you find yourself, picking up ya self
With no one to blame beside yourself

Be yourself
You gotta be yourself

You must think my head screws off and on
But see people like you don’t live too long
You think you’re a ladies man but you’re not
To tell the truth - you’re the joke of the block
Your hair’s fried and dyed, pressed to the side
You think you’re Billy Dee drinking Colt 45
Mimicking and imitating somebody else
If you wanna hang with me, you gotta

Be yourself
I said you’ve got to be yourself


When you were young, you wanted to be president
Sometimes, I wonder where those dreams went
Those thoughts that you had were dreams of the past
Speedballers get a ticket for moving too fast

You’re living the wild life and nothing to gain
Getting busy Lover Lenny was your neighborhood name
You think you’re at the top of every girl's roster
You’re not Billy Dee

But you’re more like Alfalfa

(You know what I mean)
Be yourself


Fake fingernails, ponytails down to the floor
You said that you bought ‘em so I guess that they’re yours

Grace Jones one minute, Chaka Khan the next
Selling hair everywhere 20 dollars an inch

When I seen you today it was a helluva surprise
Yesterday I didn’t notice that you had green eyes

Everytime I see you you’re face looks strange
You're like Sybil, everyday your personality change

Be yourself
You got ta be yourself

Hit me
Hit me again
Don’t hit me no damn mo'


You say you got yourself together but I’m calling your bluff
When you gonna learn that enough is enough?

If he jumped off the bridge, would you do that too?
Monkey see, monkey do, why don’t you be you?

You see everybody can’t be in front of the line
So why ya always wanna tag behind

Went to school all ya life and got a W.B
A diploma in school for a wanna be

Be yourself
Be yourself
You got ta got ta be yourself
Got dammit, be yourself",https://genius.com/Whodini-be-yourself-lyrics
The Good Part,Back In Black,1986.0,"When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)

Get down, to the good part (good part)
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
When we gonna get to it?

You was at the good part, you just didn't know it
Say what? You don't believe me and you want me to show it
When the good times came, well then the good parts went
Think about those good parts that you spent
'Cause the more you make, then the more you spend
A then you find yourself, back in debt again!
'Cause a fool and his money is soon departed
You lost yo' good thing before you got started
So you wanna know when you gonna get to the good part
Well it depends on where you start
If you start from here, then you get there quick
And if you start from here, you right next to it
To make sure there's no hold ups, in between
When you say good part, what part do you mean?
Oh that's what you mean~! I bet you do
Well baby I saved it all for you
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)

Are we gonna get down to the part I like?
You know the part that happened in the movie last night
You know the part that happens in everybody's life
You know the part I'm talkin 'bout, you know the part I like
Are we gonna get down to the part I like?
You know the part that happened in the movie last night
When the guy and the girl went out for a date
Then after that, came back to his place
Where the guy and the girl went up in the house
Closed the doors, then turned the lights out
Excuse me if I'm so rude to remind you
But all night long I done wined you and dined you
I done spent, every cent I had
Now listen here baby I'm about to get mad
All night long at the dinner at the movies
You was talkin' 'bout what you was gonna do to me!
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
Get down, to the good part (good part)
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
When we gonna get to it?
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
Get down, to the good part (good part)
When we gonna get to the good part? (Good part)
When we gonna get to it?

Now we gonna rock and bust a move
We gonna show y'all people how we groove
Now's the time to get on up
We gonna make you dance, and shake your butts
Boogie down, to a brand new beat
And I want you all, to dance like freaks
Be ready to rock, and ready to roll
Gonna rock this beat with so much soul
So boogie down, boogie down
Boogie booga boogie boogie boogie down
And now we gonna get to the good part
Get, get get to the good part
Now we gonna get to the good part
We gonna groove, gonna groove to the good part
Now we gonna rock to the good part
Gotta rock gotta rock to the good part

Now, you might think I'm playin but this is from my heart
I don't believe there IS a good part!
'Cause I've been hustlin', bustlin' and bustin' my chops
And I STILL can't get to the good part!
I'm not lookin' for a yacht or a diamond ring
I don't want a Rolls or take the limousine
Cause life is a center, of many treats
But the worst people seem to get the best seats!
But I keep goin' fo' it, and I won't stop
Because I don't believe there IS a good part!
'Cause I've been searchin' and lurchin' and lookin' real good
'Cause if there IS a good part, it ain't in my neighborhood!",https://genius.com/Whodini-the-good-part-lyrics
Cash Money,Open Sesame,UnKnown,"Cash Money Cold Cash Money (x4)
You see
Bill has lots of dollars so we call him dollar bill
He spends money like a fool 'cuz it gives him a thrill
The aim of his game is wealth and fame
A real wild lifestyle connected to his name
He's got Gucci on his arm, dressed in Louis Vuitton
AMG Mercedes Benz with a phone and alarm
But if you try and call Bill, you'll be too late
'Cuz Bill's got a bill he has to pay Upstate with no
Cash Money Cold Cash Money (x4)
Suzie's man's had a good job working 9 to 5
She said she wanted luxury, not only to survive
So now he's got another job from 10 to 4
And she still complains he's never home no more
You should've kissed him but you dissed him so he closed that door
You say you miss him but you're suing him for divorce
You wanted half of his cash and lawyer laughed
Now the only thing you are is another poor ass with no
Cash Money Cold Cash Money (x4)
Young boys on the corner outside selling crack
So they can drive in their sports car and wear big hats
Politicians just admitting about the deals that they've made
About the money they have stolen for the last decade
A bank teller catch a crook steals a hundred bucks
It's not that it was a hundred, it was a hundred too much
I've got a dollar to my name and you want to borrow that
When I yell ""Hard times!"", ""Tough Luck!"" echoes back in my face
Cash Money Cold Cash Money (x4)
Donny and Dawn, they spend all that they've got
When you tell them ""Slow down"" they say they just can't stop
They say what's yours is mine, and what's mine is mine
But the Money Huts they make designs how they recline
So if you want a big house with chandelier light
Pay attention to your spending and we'll be alright
'Cuz every dollar that is made must be properly spent
Stop spending all that money like you have no sense
I'm only telling you once, don't make me have to get ill
That if you like the way you're living, I think you'd better chill with the
Cash Money Cold Cash Money (x4)
We're the W-H-O-D-I-N-I
And we have decided to get a piece of the pie
We're not rhyming for the money this is straight from my heart
People think my car sounds funny but I can't get it to start
As I did it you were with it on top of the charts
I'm not rocking for the money what I do is an art
People say ""Yo, Whodini, I heard you made a killer
Where's your house and where's your car?""
Yo, man, we're just chilling with

As we proceed to rock the house
We would like to explain what this is all about
You see it's all about Adam, it's all about Eve
It's not all about one, but seven seas
Because I was born to rap and you were born to listen
We were all created different so there will be nothin' missing
That's why you could never live the life I live
How dare you  stop trying kid!
How dare you stare in my face
And have the nerve to think that you're taking my place
'Cause what I left behind is no longer mine
It's something I threw away and you happened to find (How dare you!)
One more thing that I'd like to add
The life you're tryin' to live I already had
And when you open your eyes you'll be surprised to see
That you could never be me
How dare you!
How dare you!
How dare you!
How dare you!
How dare you!
How dare you!

How dare you compare the love we shared
To a messed up relationship you had last year
Who told you the old should be like new?
And who gave you the right to compare the two?
Well whoever it was, they must've been wrong
And for people like you, we sing this song
How dare you! (How dare you)
How dare you! (How dare you)
How dare you try to change my life
Who are you to tell me who should I live like?
We got the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker
But see we all come from one creator
The birds and the bees make different sounds
And that's what makes the whole world go 'round
So why you want me to be like somebody else
When I'm so damn good at being myself

And Larry-Lar, he's the king of the beat

Last Night (I Had A Long Talk With Myself),Back In Black,1986.0,"Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself

Yes, in case if you wanna know what I'm talkin' about
Last night, I finally had to have it out
I sat down with myself, to set myself straight
'Cause this is one problem that couldn't wait
I tried to be cool, but things have gone too far
I said to myself ""Who do you think you are?""
Then a voice answered back that sounded just like mine
And to top that off, it also rhymed
It said ""This is your conscious, this is your pride
This is all the things you've been trying to hide
You can run and hide, from everyone else
But you see you can't hide, from yourself""
So take my advice, and give it some thought
You better change your ways, 'cause life's too short
So tomorrow I plan to be a brand new guy
And if you wanna know the deal, i'll tell you why

Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself

What you said last night, it wasn't very nice
But I sat back, and thought about it twice
But believe it or not, girl, you was right
So I decided, to take your advice
I mean after all, you are my girl
You're the last thing I want to loose in this world
I was so wrapped up in my own little game
If I ever lost you, I would be the blame
You was there to share, what I lost and found
You knew it when I blew it, when I messed around
You was there through thick, and you'll be there through thin
You was there from the start, so be there in the end
That's why I itch no one or bug it
And if you never went erase, I will always love you
And tomorrow I plan to be a brand new guy
And if you want to know the deal, I'll tell you why

Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself

Last night, just about this time
I bumped into a good friend of mine
And to see him again, was a pleasant surprise
Together again, rockin' side by side
And as we spoke and joke, he started to complain
Talkin' about he noticed how much I'd changed
Slowly but surely, as he said what he thought of me
Believe it or not, my eyes got watery
He talked about a plan he made up today
Talk about me and him rockin' all the way
Right to the top, and I mean non-stop
To be the first and the best to make it off our block
The sky's the limit, together to the finish
You got to be in it, in order to win it
So tomorrow I plan to be a brand new guy
And if you wanna know the deal, I'll tell you why

Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself
Last night, I had a long talk with myself

Echo Scratch,Back In Black,1986.0,"Serve you your way
From the people's republic of turntable town
Where instead of having battles we have showdowns
Where everybody's put into the spotlight
 rap  if they'd like
So get on up, don't be shy
Listen to us rhyme as time goes by
Everybody stand back and brace yourself
While I pull a book of rhymes off a rhymin' shelf
From A-B-C, we're X, 'Lil, and Dee
Master Dee is the cook and we're the MC
But like the waiters in your favorite restaurant
We're gonna serve you anything you want
We got a menu just as thick as any book
And if it's not on the menu, we'll ask the cook
Because special orders don't upset us
If you want it done special, why don't you let us?
Serve you your way
Serve you your way
Now I think it's only fair that I warn you
If you stay here tonight I'll be all up on you
And if you try to leave, I'll ask you to stay
'Cause baby if you stay I'll serve you your way
'Cause champagne's what you want, don't give it a thought
Just relax for awhile, let me pop the cork
If you like it a lot, let's make it a double
That's Dom Perignon, it's supposed to bubble
As the champagne works and relaxes your fear
I'll make you feel what you've been fakin', all these years
This is a brand new time, a brand new day
It's about time you got served your way
'Cause if I serve you my way, I turn you on
But if I serve you your way, I can't go wrong
Although my way's the way and your way's OK
If you want to play your way
Then I'll serve you down, to the ground
I'll toss you up in the air and spin you around
And if you wanna know what's that in the back
That's what we call the echo scratch
Dee goes , the  goes 
And that's what we call the echo scratch
Serve you your way
Serve you your way
We  and  when we give you the word
We really don't care who's second or third
In the way we speak because we play for keeps
All that we learn, we're willing to teach
To everybody, so gather around
'Cause the ones with the good stuff's back in town
We've asked those questions and learned the lesson
So we're tellin' you for your own protection
We put our special talents together
Now we're a team wearing  and leather
With platinum records, yeah we're well-respected
But there's one trick Master Dee has perfected
 itching up and down your back
Scratching to the bone while I'm on the microphone
Prepare yourself...we're introducing the echo scratch
That's what we call the echo scratch
Dee goes , the  goes 
And that's what we call the echo scratch",https://genius.com/Whodini-echo-scratch-lyrics

Swing it anyway, I gotta swing it
Anyway I gotta swing it
Swing!
Swing it anyway, I gotta swing it
Anyway I gotta swing it
Here we go with a flow for a pro
In the show a medium tempo as the spotlight glows
Artists in action, against distraction
Negativity breaks us down to fractions
We don't subtract, divide or hide
Whodini adds and multiplies
(Pose it in the form of ?)
Simple mathematics called sub-development
Anything else is totally irrelevant
Any way I got to do it to get to it
The method is fluid (so enjoy don't abuse it)
Who said youth is wasted on the young?
(That's mighty dumb)
But a dumb man said
That's crap, can you hear me in the back""
Pull out a map and let me show you where my head's at
That's why we're here, E equals MC squared

Face some haste ? chase
The bass, brings it in your face like mase
A fast that's ? what I'ma heading for
The quicker the better for the metaphor predator
Sound systems of the precise mic go haywire
Fire controls my empire
My next jam ? so slammin' you'll examinate
Dead in the head brain cells I reanimate
Suckers evolve but they ain't too sharp
Your date is in the dark
Like the raiders of the lost ark
Brothers ? dis are a disaster
It's fact, rappers are ? like plaster
Feel up ladies ?
Handmade, manmade ? on the crossfade
All suckers find it hard to swallow
When we're swingin' it, we're a tough act to follow

Yo Donkey!
Who wanna see it. I'll straighten it all out, I'll show ya
I'ma hit like this!
We ain't done son!
All the people in the house!
Creativity causes longevity
Lack of activity causes despair
If I let you get ahead of me
? instead of me
Like a thief in the night I appear
That's a ? lurch you
Shame my name and I'll hurt you
Parties getting turned out
Rappers getting burned out (quickly!)
Lyrics are decided swiftly
Funky ain't it, beats and rhymes musically painted

Just don't see each other
Time passes by (and we)
Still can't compromise

All I'm sayin' is that since you're my girl
(Can we) spend more time?
Yours for a night
I wanna be, I wanna be yours baby (Just for a night, just for a night)
Yours for a night, I wanna be, yours for a night, yours for a night
I wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Been so long (since we) sat and talked about it
I need to (exactly) what's on your mind
Feels so good when you're around
But lately girl (I swear), I've been feelin' down
Yours for a night
I wanna be yours for a night, yours for a night
That's all I'm asking you baby
Can I be yours for a night? yours for a night
Yours for a night
Can't you see I want to be yours?
I wanna be yours, I belong to you
My heart, my soul, and my body too
Now you need your friends and I understand
But don't forget that I'm still your man
I love ya girl and if ya feel the same
Some TLC will ease my pain
It's not I don't wanna share you with no one else
But just tonight I wanna have you all to myself
It's simple darlin' it's plain to see
You spend more time with your friends than me
I jumped out of bed, I closed my book
I even picked the phone up off the hook
It's the huggin' and the squeezin' I really miss
It's just the anticipation of your kiss
You might think I'm wrong but I know I'm right
Because all I wanna be is yours for a night
Yours for a night
I wanna be yours for a night, yours for a night
That's all I'm asking for baby
Can I be yours for a night? yours for a night
Yours for a night
Oooh, I've got to be yours?
Yours for a night
Yours for a night
Yours for a night
Selfish me, I don't mean to be
See your love has a strange effect on me
It makes me wanna be with you all the time
And when you're not there you're on my mind
The solution is simple, all we gotta do
Is starting spending more time just me and you
No ifs, no ands, maybe a butt
'Cause excuses are full of you know what
That's the way I feel, I gotta be blunt​
As far as I'm concerned, you're all I want
Don't look around girl, they're not involved
This is one problem only we can solve
And don't ask your friend, they don't understand
'Cause half your friends don't have a man
Don't say a word, you know I'm right
Come here girl, you're mine tonight
Yours for a night
I wanna be yours for a night, yours for a night
That's all I'm asking for baby
Can I be yours for a night? yours for a night
Yours for a night
I really, really, really, really want some..
Tell me why does it seem (that we)
Just don't see each other
Time passes by (and we)
Still can't compromise
I'm not asking much (from you)
All I'm sayin' is that since you're my girl
(Can we) spend more time?
Yours for a night
I wanna be yours for a night, yours for a night
That's all I'm asking for baby
Can I be yours for a night? yours for a night
I need to be, yours for a night
I want to be yours
My heart, my soul, my body too
Come here girl, you're mine tonight
Yours for a night
I wanna be yours for a night, yours for a night
That's all I'm asking for baby
Can I be yours for a night? yours for a night
Yours for a night
I wanna be yours for a night, yours for a night
That's all I'm asking for baby",https://genius.com/Whodini-yours-for-a-night-lyrics

I say 
What's all this about an underground?
Could you perhaps explain to me?
Uh the problem is you see we in England
Don't really know about this sort of thing
You see an underground here is in fact, uh, a subway
Now you take tubes and things like that
Huh  what's all this about, is it a club or something?
Who do you , care to explain?
We're gonna take you to the underground!
Come one, come all
We're gonna take you to the underground!
And we're gonna have a ball (Yeah!)
We're gonna take you to the underground!
Just follow me
And we're gonna have a ball (Yeah!)
We're gonna take you to the underground!
Come live in ecstasy!

We Are Whodini by Whodini,UnKnown,UnKnown,"We've got a style of our own on the microphone
And when it comes to rocking we stand alone
I'm the rapper Jalil and I'm ready to rock
And once I get started I'm hard to stop
I've got the magical touch to make you shake your butt
And Grandmaster Dee, is the king of the cuts
So party people in the house make no mistake
Jalil and Ecstasy are inside the place
And..
I am the man with a thousand rhymes
Couldn't say all of them in one weeks time
So I say some here, say some there
And I'll still be rockin' by this time next year, (Line may be incorrect)
That's why people rhyme because I'm back in heat
Plus nobody knows my rhymes except me
We're the originator, not the imitator
No one rock better, no one rock greater
Now we're one for all, all for one
Yo first class ticket to havin' fun
We're going to give you what we got and baby that's plenty
Because never have so few rocked so many
Hotter then fire, too young to retire
With a special gift to take you one step higher
We present you the American dream
Protected and respected on the disco scene
Climbing that latter we're taking the crown
Because you just can't keep a good man down
We deserved the part, from the very start
And everything we do is straight from our heart
We're the Pied Pipers of the nineteen-eighties
I'll dis your show people drive you crazy, (Line may be incorrect)
As you all well know we got the gusto
I'm telling you the crew is magnifico
Grandmaster Dee...
The rapper Ecstasy...
The rapper Jalil...
Dynasty...
The Debonair Doctor Ice..
The Kangol Kid...
Lady Stephanie...
Che Fu... (Line may be incorrect)
Lisa...
Brooklyn rock the house!
