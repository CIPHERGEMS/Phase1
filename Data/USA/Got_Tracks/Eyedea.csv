Even Shadows Have Shadows,We Came from Beyond,2010.0,"I stand alone, burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
A stronger tide is coming, I've been running
Trying to function fine without my mind
Climbing out this fucking corner

I was born a thorn away from the rotten petals
A forgotten rebel
Wrapped in the absence of Heaven's heavy hands
To develop an evident level of benevolence
So it's probably better I sold my soul to the Devil
This is a message to anyone I've met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand
None of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, look, Mom – no cuts
Just a stomach in disgust, and the fearthat I might go nuts
This year, if I don't slow up, I'll see you on my way
One day this shit'll kill me, but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all faith in a world so full of hate
And I don't fucking love music, I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
And putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll, but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to be awake
Introducing the corroded bones I hide behind my smile
I'm angry at the Universe for the way she treats me now
It keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity
Not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze
The real imprinted Hansen's disease
Not healing in this century
I'm kneeling to the entity
Who built this penitentiary's as filthy as a centipede
And guiltless in a sense, ‘cause he
Was willing to just let me bleed while I wore a game face
In 10 years, don't check for me, I'll be in the same place
This planet's just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walking round constitutes another obstacle
So here it is, I'm finally coming out my shell
All 19 years of my life have been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure about every facet of my existence
From my addictions to the condition I choose to live in
Who you kiddin'? I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind
And I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
But I've been fine disregarding my insanity
Every form of art isolates you from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
So fuck education for a decade and three years
Of headaches from my peers
‘Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow
Everything that keeps me whole
Everything that ever meant anything to Eyedea, so
I leap with golden hope to rip the leash that holds my focus
But the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 feet or 100 feet
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
Some people say I've changed and it's harder to relate to me
Good! I never liked you; our friendship was make-believe
I'm peeling the mask back and
Revealing the rap that's been filling my organs
Drilling short distorted portions
Of morbid masochistic torture that unfortunately crafted
An interest to orbit my portrait
And inflict my image with disorder
The minutes get shorter, walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on by one clothespin
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look alright, but on the inside it's so wrong
I want life to change, but I don't know if it can
For a man or machine or whatever the fuck I am

I stand alone, burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
You want to die my life
Well, come and stay in madness's favorite little corner

‘Cause even Shadows have Shadows
And my secrets are eating me
Eagerly feeding to scream my dreams away
But they keep on defeating me
(Even shadows have shadows)
Welcome to the dusty subconscious of an actor
Who murdered his childhood to stop the audience's laughter
(Even shadows have shadows)
How am I to break free from my fears
When I don't like what I see and I can't feel what I hear?
(Even shadows have shadows)
So don't judge my book by its cover
‘Cause my story's just as fucked up as any other",https://genius.com/Eyedea-even-shadows-have-shadows-lyrics
Here For You,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"There is a way out of this mess and shit
You just can’t think your way out of it
Thought is your enemy
I know I know, I got to think less. I had that thought actually
You have to let go. Let go
Let go of what? Let go of you
I mean, think about it, what have you done for you lately?
I’m having trouble following your philosophy
You have to jump in. Jump in by those scopes?
No, in the water. In the River?
Yes, Jump in the River, Jump in the River…
We're all born into this river without knowing how to swim
And eventually we learn how to keep the water under our chins
Some times this river is so cold to be in
Freezing my soul, solidifying my skin
Regardless of how far I see, I never see my travels end
We're carried by the current, being driven by the wind
The scenery we pass, we'll never see again
So we store it up as memories and don't let go of them
Were under a spell thinking the river should go straight
We set goals and desires to control our own fate
But all the pain we experience is a result of our expectations
Because it's the rivers nature to twist and turn
The shit can burn
And I know it
I have the same conflict
But I try to sit and flow with this rivers natural process
And sometimes when I watch myself float downstream
I see the beauty of it all, and it feels like a dream
And at that time I appreciate the rivers course
Some call it God, reality, momentum, force
I stare up at the naked moon, and she stares down at me
Outside false boundaries I’m all I look outward to see
The universe is not something separate from yourself
I know you feel alone, but that's why I'm here to help
I know you feel alone, but just look up at the stars
And everything that is out there is what you really are
We gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life
Everyone has different pasts and we're seeking the light
The world is divided between peasants and kings
But the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing
Now I want you to know
The role you play is part of the whole
Without you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion
So if you need anything, I mean anything at all
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
I'm here for you, in the same way that you're here for me
Each person in an intricate piece of infinity
I feel that if you could see what I see
Then we as humanity could be free
I'm here for you, not for any self centered reasons
Because existence is interdependent and all's related
Connected in its different manifestations of one single mind
You ain't isolated from the world even though it feels like that sometimes
I see the hurt when I look into your eyes
How you struggle to hold it and keep in bundled inside
It drives a dull blade deep in my heart; it makes me want to cry
So I offer you a hand to help wash away the rainy skies
I'm running out of words, but I haven't yet made my message clear
So if none of this makes sense, I just want you to know I'm here
As a musician, as a friend, as a teacher, as a student
To grow and realize that everything's in constant movement
Each problem that we face is just a part of this movement
It seems helpless, but if we stick together we'll get through it
And return to the essence from which we've been uprooted
And wake humanity from these illusions
The second you can look into the sky and see your own reflection
You know your head is in the right direction
The river riding always moves, but with it I live
And everything is perfect, just the way it is
We gotta learn to see the beauty in each moment of life
Everyone has different pasts and we're seeking the light
The world is divided between peasants and kings
But the truth is everyone is looking for the same thing
Now I want you to know
The role you play is part of the whole
Without you it couldn't be, and I mean that with compassion
So if you need anything, I mean anything at all
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
I'm here for you; all you gotta do is ask man
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream
Everything's cool as I float downstream",https://genius.com/Eyedea-here-for-you-lyrics
Weird Side,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"??? this is Felipe Cuauhtli from Los Nativos crew Rhymesayers entertainment
I'm up in the studio with my man Eyedea, I'm up in the booth doing the wop?? and the running-man looking for the keys to my lowrider
Yo, ya'll might think he's a cool cat, but this dude be acting weird

Why they always looking at me, like there's something on my face man
No matter where I go, I'm always feeling out of place
And I know I'm not your regular I got a different taste
Probably cause most my life, spent right in my basement
I didn't watch the Super Bowl, don't drink alcohol
Don't carry I.D., don't go to the mall
I'm extra argumentative and really good at fast talk
I can't dance or sing but I can rap my ass off
Hey my voice is unique, I'll leave it at that
But no rapper you know, has the ideas I have
And it ain't like the skin color really is significant
It puts you in the category of art {​​​​​​fag}​​​​​​ or idiot
But I don't try to fit in
My life's like a novel of science-fiction
My mission is to get into your mind, and make you listen and
Rewind what you were missin', everytime that you insisting to be blind
I paint a picture with the rhyme and climb the instrument
I'll hide behind a picket fence, slice a little wickedness and I
Win at this so you better bet on me
I only smile in public if I got a lot of energy
Don't go to the doc, I got my own remedies
Oh and I almost forgot I got a really good memory

I know a lot of people that'll tell you that they hate me
Cause they know I bring out the weird side
Some say I'm a genius others say that I'm crazy
But they all say I'm a little on the weird side
It ain't like I can help it, it's the way I was raised
So I'm living every minute on the weird side
Here's a ticket for the train, pay a visit to my brain
If you wanna know about the weird side
It goes dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do

I only write with a certain type of pen (chameleon)
Switching from an itchy introvert to loudmouth
First thing I do after I buy a CD is open it up
And see if my name's in the shout outs
I read books on yoga and quantum mechanics
Psychology, philosophy, peyote and acid
I like Jimi Hendrix more than any rap shit
And my favorite movie's Dr. StrangeLove, that's a classic
Never had a fist fight, got knocked out one time
Stupid motherfucker thought peace was a gang sign
Yo I never liked the circus I was too afraid of clowns
20 years in the same city still don't know my way around
And still get lost inside of my thoughts
Sayin dumb jokes just to hear myself talk
Yeah I know my clothes probably need to be washed
But I like em' and if I didn't I would take em' off

I know a lot of people that'll tell you that they hate me
Cause they know I bring out the weird side
Some say I'm a genius others say that I'm crazy
But they all say I'm a little on the weird side
It ain't like I can help it, it's the way I was raised
So I'm living every minute on the weird side
Here's a ticket for the train, pay a visit to my brain
If you wanna know about the weird side
It goes dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do

I'm not accepted by any certain group of people
I'm a walking talking freak-show, by now you know my steelo
Hey, everybody's weird, you know that's true
I bet you even got a little bit of weirdness in you
My lyrics are due depression and in essence repression unprecedented
Identity representin' the quest
I guess I'm just ahead of my time
Blame my pedigree, I'm telling you a tale of the time, embellish the melody
Who are you to say I got a few loose screws, dude?
The tools humans use can never measure my texture
Extra, extra read all about it Eyedea's an extraterrestrial don't let him
Touch you or even sit next to you
Hey I don't write, so you're wrong and that makes me right
Song after song, night after night
Gonna spit my words into the mic
And the crowd reacts nice if it's something that they like
Now is that so strange to want the attention
If you think I should change, man save your suggestions
I swear someday I'm gonna be somebody's hero
But until that day I'm just another fuckin' weirdo",https://genius.com/Eyedea-weird-side-lyrics
Infrared Roses,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"Well I guess this is it, I guess this is uh.. time or whatever
So I guess I'll start it like this
And I'll never again be as happy as I was when I was in the 7th grade
Before the guilt of having no goals ate my life away
Each day introduced me to something that I hadn't experienced yet
Traded A's for F's to gain the time to experiment with drugs and sex
I'll never forget me and Jakes first roses trip together
Or the times when we all walked aimlessly in the summer weather
With nothing better to do I rode to S.A
And tried to steal a pack of squares
Man I miss being a kid with no cares
It's the excitement of knowing everything you touch is new
I just wish I could've stopped to cherish the moment while it lasted but
Maybe that's the point, the second you're smart enough to recognize freedom
You're no longer free
You see heaven isn't some place that we go to when we die
It's that split second in life where you actually feel alive
And until the end of time, we chase the memory of that
Hoping the future holds something better than the past
So why do I spend my time runnin' away?
When the truth is right here in the mirror inside my dying face
I can waste my energy tryin' to reproduce something that's gone
But my childhood is dead, it's time to move on
So what do you call a person that's already past his peak?
Just a stagnant sheep you keep counting when you can't go to sleep
Two years out of high school goin' on way too deep
Tell me again why 7th grade was so brief? Damn...

The curiosity that killed Schrödinger's cat was the only thing that
Kept it alive matter of fact
When life takes your life away how do you get it back?
Like that... like that...",https://genius.com/Eyedea-infrared-roses-lyrics
Forget Me,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"Would you believe there's only four more people in the world
And when you're not looking they change masks?
Somewhere over the rainbow
It's the same old set of needle infested train tracks
No matter how fast you run from the I you hate
There is no escape (There is no escape)
So I wait for the heaven that I seek
Which makes everything insignificant differences
Innocence indolence the vision amongst religion
Visioning innovative criticisms are the state of mind we're living
Time is ticking
If you listen to the sign that wisdom efficiently spreads
Sing a song that officially deadens the mission
They're clinging onto fiction
I stand stiff in disposition
Plans shift
Cause to me your man is in an issue of your ego tissue
Explicit to the point of non-existence
And life in the past is your only interest
I used to build forts in the backyard to hide from the daytime
Missing all the beauty of the sunshine
It's my fault
But I blame the world to a small degree
I've never seen the sky cause I been too scared it would fall on me
So what? You're mad cause I don't want to talk?
But you'd be even more pissed off if I told you what I really thought
So just walk away (just walk away)
You're better off never caring what I say (never caring what I say)

I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm my own mental patient
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free
Kill my dedication
Put me on your medication
Drop me off in space and never come to get me
Nothing that I say has ever been that amazing
So when I die do me a favor and forget me (forget me.. x7)

Well
Something in the air make me not want to care
Let 'em stare till I'm riding on an empty spare
Follow the vein straight
As it drapes across the landscape and the sand and the lake
Off the beaten path
Learn the secret math
Keeping the laugh, smug
Too deep in the back of luck
Happy as fuck
But nobody's convinced
Play daddy to the love and try to drop a couple hints
Ever since I first came to learn all the right turns
I was cursed with the cigarette burns and the lost words
Found inspiration inside your misery
Always trying to take an inch
More than what they're giving me
Dear God
Let me die on the rich people's lawns
Because I'm not so sure they're gonna learn my songs
Every morning he repeats that same shit
Spends the day dying to be famous
Well another day, shot
And I'm thinking this aquarium is deeper than the last one
My castle was never made of sand
It's one big aluminum can
The chateau of the damned
The shadow of the man you pretend you are
Had a rough thought that got caught and went too far
And if I did have a car I'd go broke from the gas
On the shoulder of the road
While you roll past

I've been a lot of places and I've seen a lot of faces
I don't miss none of them and they don't miss me
Fell in love with sensation
Now I'm my own mental patient
But that's the price you pay if you want to live free
Kill my dedication
Put me on your medication
Drop me off in space and never come to get me
Nothing that I say has ever been that amazing
So when I die do me a favor and forget me (forget me.. x7)",https://genius.com/Eyedea-forget-me-lyrics
How Much Do You Pay?,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"No one really understands the experience that jades logic
And paves an agnostic place to lay and decay in toxic waste
So most carry identity paraphernalia to familiarize with smiles neatly
Painted on a robotic face
But not this man, he played the bucket with his hands
And got paid by whatever change
People would drop in his can
Twenty-three years ago he was a lawyer by description
But I guess all of a sudden he resigned from that position
But I've never seen the sky quite as clear as his eyes
As his blistered fingers beat down on the plastic
And in a twisted sort of way it all makes sense
While they rush to die he provides the soundtrack so tragic
He sits on the corner of 7th and 1st
And I was thirsty for the answer
To a question anyone would nurse
One day I asked him why he gave up his career
He said, ""I didn't, I just took off the name tag"" then he added
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
So I took in what was said but I didn't accept it
Well maybe I did I mean I just wouldn't admit it
I was too committed to the belief that all the hard work from now would
Improve my future existence somehow
So I said, you don't accomplish nothing sitting in the street
And I'm sure you barely survive off the pennies you gather
He said, to your surprise I make enough to eat
And I accomplish just as much as you only I stop pretending my job matters
He looked me in my face and told me I was a puppet
And what I do is no more important than playing a bucket
I still hear his voice when I set my alarm before bed
I never could wash what he said out of my head, so fuck it, it goes
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
See I can dress myself up in a white coat and say I'm a doctor
Carry an arm on my belt buckle with a gold badge and say I'm a copper
Maybe I'm just a sloppy lazy crazy carbon copy part of the heartlessly
Deranged nation that gave me the generation ecstasy under water, I forgot
The survivor of the mind washed and slaughtered. I've watched your offers, caught your calls and
Called your forefathers my bosses, lost it all in the name of gaining enough
To spend, consuming the youth since those pray in doom for the hand my friends, see
When I saw my man playing away on his drum
Something clicked in my brain and I became less numb
I'm working for bread crumbs
Pretending there's a meaning
But my employment is just a bucket, I'm desperately beating
And one day, I'll be old and retired
Looking at my life like what a waste of good fire
All because school never taught me how to be inspired
And the job concerned applying to myself just wouldn't hire
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
It don't matter what name you gave the bucket that you play
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way
Make Money and die that's the American Way

Bottle Dreams,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"Everyone knew she was a special young girl
From her neighbors to her teachers
Some labeled her a prodigy, others called her a genius
It was amazing the way she could play the violin
It made it hard for people to believe that she was only ten
But behind every brilliant mind there lies a monster
This one just so happened to be her father
See daddy was sick, he'd get a rush by playin' touchy touch
And tellin' her to keep it hush
It was his secret way of loving that he needed someone he could trust
Fucked her head up, sayin' if Momma was alive she'd be so proud of us
So she'd hide the desire to die
But if you paid close attention you could see the sorrow in her eyes
Walking around in the only real hell
No one would ever think she'd have such a story to tell
Afraid to go home, afraid to talk, afraid of cryin
She was too young to even know why

And everyday she'd go to the river with a message in a bottle sayin'
Please, God help me I don't wanna live to see tomorrow
Each day she'd scrounge for a tiny shred of hope
Just to wish the bottle would stay afloat
But every single solitary day, the bottle seems to sink
I don't know why but the bottle always sinks
She never sees it happen, but the bottle always sinks
Now only the bottom of the river knows what she really thinks

She made that violin sing with so much pain
You could almost hear her scream through the string's vibrations
What was once sweet and innocent
Is now rotting 'cuz the psychotic father
Chose to probe the flowers of the pure and sacred
Her instrument was her only tongue
To express the infinite abuse in its depths
At night the footsteps crept to her door and she'd begin to shake and weep
And with tears rolling down her cheeks, she's pretend she was asleep
When the nightmare was over, and the sun dawn is light
She'd retreat to the same place she always did
Rip a page from her diary, and write with all her might
Then send it off into the current, determined to find a way to live


Being a victim of her daddy's hands for so long
She lost the will to move on
Sick of picking up her violin to hide from what's wrong
Exhausted, but staying strong
She tried to play the bright side
But couldn't bring herself to make
Nothing but sad songs
Sick of that sick feeling that stays in her stomach
Sick of waiting for a rescue
By someone who found one of her bottles
Sick of being daddy's little secret
She got up at the crack of day
And smashed her violin into pieces
Then proceeded to walk towards the river with a plan
Only this time the diary and bottle was in her hand
Just walk with herself, away from the hell
Not knowing at the river bottom lied all the cries for help
It was weeks before they found her dead body
Some fisherman reeled it from the water
Like something from a detective novel
Diagnosis: suicide, stemmed from desperation
Cause near where she drowned they found about 500 messages in sunken bottles",https://genius.com/Eyedea-bottle-dreams-lyrics
Step by Step,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"(I got a little story I'm gonna tell y'all)
See it was September 1st, 1999, the day of my death
My back was on the cold concrete as I took my last breath
I saw my body laying on the ground as my soul hovered above me
Damn Eyedea, you was a good looking cat
But anyway, another day at eighteen years of age
Step into heaven's gate anxious to see what God got to say
Maybe he'll give me a gift for always saying my prayers
But he might send me downstairs for last year's love affair
Well, who cares
You know, right now it's all a mystery
I mean, I'll find out when I get there
Until then I can't let it get to me
I'm keeping my cool, besides, everybody dies
I'll just follow the white light like the do in the movies
It seems like hours went by and I'm still traveling right towards the brightness
Now this ain't heaven or hell, this realm is lifeless
And I hate to say it but this wild goose chase had me bored
No directions, no clues, and no *idea* what I was in for
But then forward I kept floating
And then a quick flash; the lights split directly in half
And created a forked path
Representing each side was an angel
""Now what's the task I have to untangle to meet the big man in charge?"" I ask
And the one on the right of me says
""One of us always lies, and the other one always tells the truth
Ask the right one the right question, and he'll direct you to heaven
But if you ask the wrong one son, farewell you're going straight to""
Well, y'all get the picture
The one on my left told me not to listen to his fibs
He said, ""it ain't that complicated to find out where God lives""
He told me to follow his path and tell God he said hi
Then the one on my right jumped in and told me not to believe his lies
And I'm like Jesus fucking Christ, I didn't care much for life
But I've tried to stay alive forever, if I knew this is what death was like
I was never good at problem solving, especially in emergencies
I get a tad bit nervous when concerned with burning for eternity
But anyways, I asked them which one lied, and they pointed at each other
And thinking I had it, I asked the name of my mother
One said he don't know, the other said he know but he can't tell me
Goddamn this is gonna be hard
So I asked like thirty questions and I still wasn't sure
But being me I got pissed and gave those pricks a few good words
Frustrated with it all
I turned my back to the angels and when I walked away
To my surprise
I found myself in heaven
Ya know I'm saying
Kinda just turned around from the whole situation
Rejecting everything that was going on
That's how I walked into heaven
I walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven
I walked away, walked away, walked straight into heaven",https://genius.com/Eyedea-step-by-step-lyrics
Soundtrack of a Romance,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"It’s amazing how many drugs you find out you actually do
Once you stop doing drugs
You know, you quit eating acid and downing booze
But you still indulge in food, sex, and six billion other nouns
That bury away your so called overall addiction
Right now I’m sitting in a hospital waiting
And I’m using my ability — or, or inability to write, as a drug
It sort of isolates me from the reality of what’s about to happen
I could vividly recall my mood the day that art was murdered
The wind blew a thin layer of dust on my garden burger
Everything you knew was sideways and phallic
The highways traffic added to Friday's madness
The warm wrinkled skin loosely hung off earnest cheekbones
Below eyes designed to bury the wolf under a sheep's clothes
Some peoples sang, a few begged for change
A young girl skipped along with her hand glued to a candy cane
I, however, walked with my back to it as usual
Wanted to turn this dark comedy into a musical
I'm used to reflecting the sorrow the world reflects at me
We're forever intertwined as the anxious and angry
The gloom moves into oxygen, consumed to keep me lost within
A mushroom cloud of toxins deposited to leave the prophets doomed
There I sat on a lead infested picnic table
Waiting to be born, carefully evading mating season's evil horns
I keep performing for the poets and philosophers
But they don't know I was insane before it became popular
I lose something every time I leave my house
Trying to gain something by running my mouth
My conscience don't hold a grudge against my impulse
Honesty should be the best policy but it's not that simple
Have you ever had the sky inject a cloud into your lymph nodes
So all you see is how she gazes through a frameless window?
Everyday I have a new argument with myself
Wonder how I got this far up the ladder
But by now I should have fell
Can't go to heaven, never learned how to pray
Oh well, Rather be in a place with less people anyway
Somewhere between a snare and the extra-tire hogwash
I got caught in a motion of a sex-inspired god talk
My long-lost lover left me to date a real artist
Ain't it strange how the whole story can be told through a guitar rift
I'm a pretentious vendor of invention
It's a demented way of staying the center of attention
Take my advice and never take my advice
I haven't left my own head long enough to really know about life
But I dug dirt out of the ground and found Plato's time capsule
Inside was a note that said, ""sorry I lied""
Part of my pride was dead the second that you talked to me
And I knew that no matter what lied ahead you wouldn't walk with me
So alone I traveled
Clown shoes through dirty speed infested tourist colonies
Tricking revolutionaries into thinking my records
A new age life-insurance policy
Then I'm off
And before they get the chance to give me a dirty look
Their money's spent at Borders on a brand new Krishnamurti book
A sturdy hook deserves a better catch phrase
But I'm only still here because they can't detect
Neurotic tendencies with x-rays
It was a perfect day to sit and watch the wind
Cause the recognition of my insanity
Made me want to be hip-hop again

My facial skin feels like potato chips
And the way these lights reflect of everyone’s nervous expressions
Reminds me of the fourth grade
A whole month just because I couldn’t outrun the enemy (Football's for idiots)
Anyway, so, how do you solve the drug problem?
Just move to the desert, quit everything?
I think the trickiest way addiction manifests
Is through the process of ‘giving it up'
So make music

I make music to ride to, to cry to, to die to
Times two, and finally realize you're alive to
I make music to vibe to, to close your eyes to
Break your mind from each vault that sits inside you
I make music for survival, to find you
To hide from the landscape humanity went blind to
I make music to rhyme to, to waste time to
To die to, to realize I'm alive to

I only pray my lips never follow the ever so hollow descriptions of these pictures in my head that make me sick
I'm the fight between a god-freak and an atheist
That argue the same point no matter which way the conversation drifts
Any human being that believes he's truly happy just found a fake way to escape from his craziness, you know?
I'd trade my dick for a safe place to sit
If I wasn't so afraid of grenades made by spaded patriots
I crave a fix teeth grinded when our hand shakes
So I'm just as approachable as any halfway intelligent sadist is
Mary had a little lamb blood buried in her sacred wall
Til one by one each belief you've ever had raped the bitch",https://genius.com/Eyedea-soundtrack-of-a-romance-lyrics
How Eye One The Write Too Think,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"It took me a while to realize that we was on the same page
We just go about reading it out loud in different ways
I ain’t the only person that’s traveled through this maze
Not really sure whether it’s me or them that’s crazy
Making a hole in every simple system to rekindle the vision
That lost its position, that’s cost is superstition
Sitting in a time machine, a bleeding mind dreams
Of beating blind at steam, to give the crime scene shine and gleam
I’m no longer a boy scout
Cause punching myself in the head won't necessarily get that voice out
That’s something no one ever took the time to point out
But I had to learn to whisper before I could enjoy shoutin’
Periodically I feel like I’ve wasted my breath
And all I’ve got to show for it is paper stained ink
But I ain’t really trippin’ at the end of the day
Cause life is experience, and that’s how Eye One The Write Too Think
It’s How Eye One The Write Too Think ya’ll
It’s How Eye One The Write Too Think
It’s How Eye One Write Too Think ya’ll
I think about all the time that I spent trying to find an identity rhyming invents
So then I could defy by the minds penitentiary four corner rooms, a forks in the path
Consume every inch of my inner symmetry to break out the trap essentially distant
Mentally I’ll eventually snap habitually proud dysfunctional prone
Groomed it new where his thought bloomed, tomb is in musical wounds
And my shadow grew to be my only tribune
And it taught me never to abuse a full
Moon is not suitable sometimes you gotta lose control to gain it
Kind of truths to hold the rain that falls don’t bruise my soul
Like it used to, I’m used to it
And now I’m just working on smoothing out the kinks
The circuitry allows some head room before the break
So what do you gotta tell me that I don’t already know?
Just shut the fuck up and let me grow
I learn from my mistakes and eyes widen with each
Disrupt the clinks or call it what you want but this is How Eye One The Write Too Think
It’s How Eye One The Write Too Think ya’ll
It’s How Eye One The Write Too Think
It’s How Eye One Write Too Think ya’ll
I was scared to death barely slept take a breath prepare to step from where I wept to shed my tears till no nightmares were left
I had my years but no one cares to see the prayers and sweat
They just wanna share the nest and earn their percent in turn
Let it burn till the ashes isolate the cold ground
On that I stood but on this I stand and hold down
I used to be the seed of this ghost town but that was then and this is now
That was then and this is now
The war between the old brain and the new brain was won
When the prehistoric forfeited alien strangles reptile and migrates towards inner peace
The caveman dies quiet the cries riots and bias cease
No one saved my seat when I decided to rise and slay the beast
I just shut my eyes and gave my speech
But I never could have known I would become my own missing link
And it feels greater than I thought that’s How Eye One The Write Too Think
It’s How Eye One The Write Too Think X3

The Dive (a),First Born,2013.0,"It starts out with a question. How much of it is real?
The skepticism sets in, and lessens your appeal
Next, you study conspiracy, develop some theories
And become extra wary of all your previous learned material
Your tolerence for stupidity degrades
Most of your friends seem to be trapped in the maze
You narrow your associates down to the few you can stand
And even they sometimes wonder what's going on in that head of yours
You study east and western philosophy, psychology, physics
You think a lot more, and start to question existence
You wonder about your nervous system's limits
You tamper with reality maps, and then ask hallucinogenic induced
""Who am I's? What am I? Am I forever?""
All information breathes in the shallow dark hells of never
You can see where it's leading. You wish you were dreaming
If the castle crumbles no one's there to put it back together

Have you ever felt yourself slippin' away?
Where all you think about's your sanity, and how it decayed?
There's no place to run, no place to hide
You can't escape from inside, and you're losing your mind
You try to think of when it started, and ask yourself why
But each thought deepens the sickness and completes the desert dry
Fear feeds the derangement of the inner eye
With nothing left you find yourself falling to madness so you...
... cry to your god, and act normal to your peers
What if God ain't hearing you? That's your only fear
Each day you think more about your psychosis
No one but you can help you, and you know this
That's the craziest part of it all
In your rational mind, you only know two things for sure
One is that you're totally nuts
And the other is that you're the only one with the cure
It doesn't make sense, it's not how you imagined
You never knew it could just happen
You thought it came from stress, suicide, a near death experience
War, drug trips, low pay, carelessness
You've heard plenty of stories about schizophrenia
But never had evidence of one who thought himself mad
You're going crazy, and desperately reachin' for reason
But the strain to stay sane's your only demon; best believe it

You finally realize that you've always lived in hell
No human model or metaphor can explain how you fell
The puzzle's alive, and it changes as you try to escape it
It created time and made it appear to pass by
You don't know what you think. You don't think what you know
You're a total lunatic, and afraid it's starting to show
Where do you go when your brain is your worst enemy?
The six hundred and sixty six foot tall bridge on seventh street?
You're scared. You're scared. Why are you so scared?
There'd be no problem if you didn't care
Now you've truly formed an opinion about heaven
It starts out with a question, and this is what it ends in
Now I know you've felt yourself slip away
Now all you think about's your sanity, and how it decayed
There's no place to run. No place to hide
You can't escape the fact that you've lost your mind
You can't erase your mistakes. There's no way to rewind
The harder you look, the harder it is to find
Fear feeds the derangement of the inner eye
With nothing left you find yourself falling to madness, so you dive
So you dive (repeated)
And with each foot you fall
The voice in your head starts to sound more and more like yours",https://genius.com/Eyedea-the-dive-a-lyrics
On This I Stand,First Born,2013,"On this I stand
Two sets of footprints placed ahead of the dirt softened from tear drops
And overlooking the earth as the son of the moon
Protected by a forcefield of pure thought (On this I stand)
A rally of unemployed disgruntled words long for long journeys to somewhere
Somewhere that only caused me pain as I strain my soul cramming it with light
So I can bring some there
I bleed the blood of a cold stone that rolls without a shadow
I'm only deep enough to realize that I'm shallow
My head I keep it up, but its hard to keep it straight
When you don't believe in love
And you just can't cope with hate
Metal rust, leaves turn into dust
As the difference between love and lust clarifies as trust
If you only had an hour to sum your whole life up
Would you spend that hour sayin' that an hour ain't enough?
I've escaped the shell that bound me to cowardice
Now I'm faithful to the wind, but compared to it I'm powerless
The first step was made, and it was a fair accomplishment
The pond was sittin' still, so I threw a rock in it
And as my reflection rippled, it all became clear
Seasons always change so there's no reason for fear
We made an autobiography of our pivotal years
It's all I got and I'm giving it to you because I care

A lot of the time humans, as artists, exist in a self-projected state of falsehood
We're either too close to our image to be objective in our perception
Or too far away to be subjective in any matter
This only widens the void in social conformity introduced to our souls at birth
And so I write, but
I don't write without the intention of objectivity or attention on the image
But only as an omni-directional bridge
 between the several, floating, tunnel-structured 
realities present in incomparable space and time
See I don't write for the future, I write about the future, for the present
I write with my past, about the future, for the present

(On this I stand)
The oasis of the limbo, adjacent to my generation, facing out the window
Waiting for some ventilation, patient while the wind blows
Graceful in its demonstration, overall innovation
(On this I stand)
A fountain of youth sovereignty, a thousand syllables more than a pound of flesh
A deep breath of achievement, a dream and a wake-up call
Another haul of the quest
(On this I stand)
A letter to civilization
(On this I stand)
The purity of creation
(On this I stand)
A paradigm for self
(On this I stand)
A 'thank you' for your help
(On this I stand)
My first born child
(On this I stand)
Something for now
(On this I stand)
Life, love, death, and hate
(On this I stand)
An album, glad you could relate. Peace...",https://genius.com/Eyedea-on-this-i-stand-lyrics
Walking,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"Crescent Moon is in the house
And the Oddjobs, they're in the house
And I Self, he's in the house
And The Micranots, they're in the house
And Mad Son is in the house
And the UP is in the house
And The Streets(?)
And Phull Surkle is in the house
Now check me out

Sometimes it's best to give up the fight
All that really matters is I know that I'm right
I can't be following anyone else's ideal path of success
I pass up that stress, feel mad for the rest, gasping for breath
Trapped in my head, asking for less rations in death, passion is left
Ashes to dust...
Just consider the love of an antique pot on my window sill
My mask is my flesh my dream is to grow wings
And sing 'til freedom rings
I got a rhythm but I'm eager to unplug my speaker
And let my heart be my teacher
It's hard to tell where all this comes from
It's like my soul holds a song that eternity left undone
But it'll never be finished
That's the point
I got to get going
Thanks for the inspiration

I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
So next time there's a rainbow
I'm a run away from it
So when I turn around
I'll see it while it's strong

Now I don't care about my whereabouts
I'll blare it out, I got to go that's all I know
I'll hit the road and find my soul in the sin
They say there is no maybe please don't doubt
Conceive what you can be, infinity
That everything and anything anyway
I see your eyes and realize I need to cry
That you and I it's hard to hide
What's being lied so deep inside
Thanks for your help
But I won't find nothing better
In a world this beautiful
I'll be walking forever

I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

Journey I don't expect nothing
But the un-expectable
The only thing I know for a fact
Is that I'll never know too much about myself
So I'm a keep learning
Cause I'm determined to find what keeps this fire burning
Turning these pages just as slow as I can
Reading every single word from the poet within
I float with the wind and stay content
Wherever it carries me
There was no beginning and there won't be an end
I'm just a piece of the galaxy
A seed in the soil
A stream of consciousness
And to the seasons I'm loyal
Don't take my movement personal
It's not that I don't dig you
But I can't be on the beach
Of your sea when it boils
And so I walk with the music
Because to me that's all that's real
Don't know where I'm going
Don't have a plan
I've been hearing instructions my whole life
And I still think walking away from the rainbow
Will make you more of a man

I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself
Speaking of walking, as I walked onto the set
The director was like, what the fuck you doing!
Glanced around and said, my fault I'm in the wrong movie",https://genius.com/Eyedea-walking-lyrics
The Walls Came Tumbling Down,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"I'll never forget that day
The reflection of the cave in the river
The day we accidentally broke the models
Dead, alive, asleep, and awake
 and genuinely afraid -
That there would be no tomorrow
I didn't see it coming, I must have been blind
I never knew that space existed without time
It's just some places that you're not supposed to find
In the deep, dark halls of the mind
You're never not you; that's the trip
And these zombies walk around not comprehending how it feels
To float in a realm where everything is nothing -
And you consider taking your life just to prove death is real, well
There's no devil outside the three of us
We hadn't wrote nor talked about it, we didn't need the stuff but
 -
We paid the fare, and we took the train
Three teenagers, helping each-other go insane

We were so excited for that day to come around
Just wanted to have fun like your average high school clown
No words can explain exactly what we found
And the walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
Came tumbling down
Came tumbling down

You guys know
That no one outside us'll ever understand
Truthfully I don't even think that we do
It's like thinking about thinking
And watching your head orchestrate a reality with the absence of ego
I can't explain it...
I can't find the words
The world probably thinks we're disturbed
But when I stood upon those rocks, I was in Hell
And ya'll were both there with me
By your faces, I could tell
And I admit, it was dangerous
We could have fell behind a trapdoor and never got out
But the fact that we did
See, that means we're strong
And the experience was all well worth it, no doubt
We never have to go there again
Maybe we only made it back by pure luck
But if I was asleep my whole life, when I finally woke up -
At least I knew that existence was nuts

We were so excited for that day to come around
Just wanted to have fun like your average high school clown
No words can explain exactly what we found
And the walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
The walls came tumbling down
Came tumbling down
Came tumbling down

We ain't ever gonna look at anything the same
Perception, animation, happiness, pain
I still feel like I'm sitting on that bench
And nothing around me makes sense
I remember the rain in the night falling right before our eyes
Horrified in a universe, we don't recognize
Let's not alter our nervous system for safety
Let's just watch ourselves paint ourselves in this painting
It's crazy, but at least now we know it
We can put together a puzzle with the piece we unfolded
The brain's a fun house, a madman's playground
But I know myself, that's something I can really say now
I hope you both, feel the same
Each personal Heaven, can breath forever
And if we're insane, fuck it; we're insane
At least the three of us are insane together

Pessimism at its peak dropping in the worst way
Never had the time to count all the birthdays
Besides all the true heroes die before they're thirty
Excited, the fantasies provide adrenaline
Rivaled by the insight often mistook for rhetoric
Gentlemen, put your perspective back in a box
If I was you I'd slit my wrist out of respect for hip hop
I only came cause I thought that you'd be leaving soon
And I woulda stayed had I known I'd get to see you lose

I watch you eat your words and wash em down with pride
Give the speakers a good excuse to overload
Suffocating wasteland, vanishing your plan so

Never knew a nervous breakdown could be so soothing

And the poet came to put the cyanide in the party punch
Back up, you rappers just suck
I hope you die and I hope in your next life you have better luck
Huh, I'll embarrass you in front of your own house
And turn around battle every rapper in the crowd and be like peace out
I'm gone, even my freestyles a nostalgic song
I'm eons beyond you peons when the M.I.C.'s on
I'm even ahead of myself by light years
Might not always be right, but I'll always be right here
Fighting the war, fighting off the ward I'm buried in the crevice that separates excitement and boredom
I'm a true genius, I always knew the world was flat
That's why they all fall off when they walk in one direction for too long
And I'll probably follow they footsteps 'cause if I had a chance to reinvent my blueprint
But I could sweet talk the solar system into sodomy
As long as I'm here, to contaminate your ears

I'ma be your new favorite form of pollution
Float on the tightrope choke on its loose ends
Pissin' in the gene pool promoting evolution
Never knew a nervous breakdown could be so soothing
I'ma be your new favorite form of pollution
I'ma be your new favorite form of pollution
I'ma be your new favorite form of pollution
I'ma be your new favorite form, favorite form...

Yeah, 20 bars left till meltdown acid indigestion progression hell bound
Every deed for my self now, lemme bleed all over your see through shell child
Young dumb and full of compulsion, neurosis
I'll lose this whole war, before I lose focus
So take your dirty hands off the mic, punk
Life's a bitch, and then you get treated like one
Trudging through the field the sinister grins diminishing anxious minutes
Feed my cynicism adrenaline innocent standby-er
Sit calmly in the fire sift through the wood chip, call me when you get tired
I can feel your whole aura needs a tune up
And I got enough momentum to back your whole crew up
Just relax and breath in the mustard gas
You can function as the normal social scab like you always have
Stay at two and ten on the wheel of karma
That is if you can get the ignition to start up
I don't believe you, and you don't believe in me
But you don't have to, you'll still wind up buying my disease

Float on the tightrope choke on its loose ends

Sometimes I wonder if you'll ever shut the hell up
But you don't quit, and you just don't stop
Sometimes I wanna hop on the 5 and ride circles around my city a couple times
And pity my troubled life
Sometimes I wake up like 'fuck the world!'
And after I fuck my girl, I wanna curl up in the corner of my basement
Waitin' for civilization to fold
The pressure to pay that toll, no longer takes control
So I can be a better dad, I can be better in bed
I can be a better man, I can be better off dead
I can a better son, boyfriend or employee
But I better fix my head before I let that shit destroy me
Yeah, you know me, that cat with no game, no gear
Been in love as many times as I've been alive in years
It ain't my fears that's riding me, nope
It's how I cope and construct, and how I act as if I don't give a fuck
But damn, if I stop and count the amount of fucks I've handed out
All in the name of trying to find what it's about
I'd probably drown, gasp, cough, gurgle, found dead
Stiff position as if I'm about to jump that hurdle
So while you lose your hair, I'm losing a war
You living thick off the pulp while I'm chewing the core
And sometimes I reflect, sit and wish that I was ignorant
Unaware of the poison so I could enjoy sipping it
That's why the only thing on my mind is everything
So I blame my brain for trying to hold me down
And when they finally wash it and hang it out to dry
Make sure they know I spoke, make sure they know my sound

Dear primate relatives with extra-terrestrial intelligence
I've gathered delicate information stating my spaceship's developed a virus
And I was thrown out of orbit past the moon
And crashed here November 9th, 1981, Monday afternoon
I've adapted to this twisted way of living
But I always knew I wasn't from this planet cuz I'm so damn different
I've kicked it with kids that would've but couldn't
Kids that could've but wouldn't
Some took it, misunderstood, stood under it and overlooked it
Love, hate, straight, crooked
Bad, good, should, shouldn't
Plastic, metal or wooden
It's all a powdered water-based pudding
This is a cry for help and I don't give a fuck
I've joined every alien cult on earth waiting for ya'll to pick me up
I've sipped the cup of reality, now my brain is dying
I try and explain I'm not human, now my room is an insane asylum
They blame the violence on children and try to forget they raised 'em
Jerry Springer and Banned From TV is what they get paid from
Man, I hate them homosapiens, they're a little too complex
Survival instincts are blocked for the biggest cock contest
Man, please come get me, the shit's sickening
Man, I can't stand it
I wanna break the ozone and go home to my own planet
This panic, I'm stranded, goddamnit I'm damaged, my sanity's bandaged
Ever since I landed I've been abandoned and planned to run
I ran and managed to reach peace for a day or two
But it's probably government computer chips that make me think the way I do
Hey, I knew my origin was beyond this galaxy, even as a baby
I asked the ones who told to call parents and they said I was crazy
I've been beat half to death by those designated to serve and protect
I pay them taxes from my check so they break my neck
Now take a sec and think what I did to deserve this
I'm waiting for the mothership spacecraft
To take me away from this purposeless earth shit
It's worthless
I'm like a polar bear living in the equator
Or an ice cube in the refrigerator
I'm outta place and outer space is where I need to get ya'll

Music without a place
Man without a plate
Metal plate in skull which means I'll never get a chance to fly
Wasn't coordinated enough to get college grants for playing sports
But I stole your girl
She was lucky enough to get the goods by a smooth talkin', player hatin'
On the class failin', shoplifting one man solar system
I'm the sun to earth, super nova Novocain, no preservatives
Don't know exactly what life means
But I know for damn well that she ain't talkin' to me
But I know everything I spend somehow will always end in negativity
I can smoke all your imbecilic isms and idol ideologies
For idiots who idolize ideals but never truly comprehend
And feel experience experiments
They said take breaths when you can
I fill my pockets will small triangle remnants of static moments
Pessimism appeals to Sole which stikes him as more likable
Never know no equals, still my style becomes more biteable
I forgot how to sleep, don't remember being tired
Which means heads think I'm sick until the day that I'm fired
A wise man told me be a snake and let all people believe you're a sheep
Cuz all ya have is your pride, so in the end you'll never sell me cheap

On a Clear Day,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"(On a clear day) I can see for miles
(On a clear day) I can be myself
(On a clear day) I can sit in my place
(On a clear day) I'm not part of this race
(On a clear day) I'm not in this alone
(On a clear day) I got freedom to roam
(On a clear day) I can sit in my place
(On a clear day) I withdraw from the race

Excuse me, but there's so much here for you to touch
And there's nothing I can do to make you give a fuck
Sometimes everything ain't enough
When the eyes retire from wearing desire's handcuffs
If I was content sitting I wouldn't need to stand up
Why am I living if I can't love?
I want to scream at the top of my bleeding lungs
Never meant to break your trust
Just wanted to wake you up
Once before I left in this personal search for clarity
Either they're scared of me or laughing hysterically
I'm just a parody of something that apparently
Was never properly prepared to bleed
Oh how do I wish that I'd never learned to cry
When your only reply is waving your hands from side-to-side
I am lost cause I'm my own tour guide
And if I ever talk to myself I'll probably tell lies
So for now I sit in this disfigured toadstool
Showing the face of a child that only smiles cause he's told to
Sometimes they look to me for the answers and I don't know what to do
I'm usually just as confused as you

(On a clear day) I can see for miles
(On a clear day) I can be myself
(On a clear day) I can sit in place
(On a clear day) I'm not part of this race
(On a clear day) I'm not in this alone
(On a clear day) I got freedom to roam
(On a clear day) I can sit in my place
(On a clear day) I withdraw from the race

The chord sprung a leak
The mind was filled with cork crumbs
Charisma bit its cheek and died of boredom
It's not a clear day until the war is done
And I'm no longer haunted by the bullet hole
I put in the head of a porcelain clown found porch bum
Reciting my spells biting the nail off my sore thumb
Leaving for good I knew that when the door swung
I don't believe that I could stay even if I wanted to
My brain ain't gray sky or water proof
So by tomorrow I'll be a robot again
The thought of the clouds coming in makes me cringe
But I've been in the storm, submerged in the distortion
For most of my days spent following this course and
I'm learning to love the moment that's rolling
Instead of openly viewing time as my opponent
So I'm always...
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Here let me cut this shit man
It's a nice day
Fuck sitting here and writing
I'm going for a walk...",https://genius.com/Eyedea-on-a-clear-day-lyrics
Track 1,Duluth is the Truth,2009,"Its October 23rd
It's a funny word
I touch the herd on the grass that's grazin
Crush my words touch me make it feel amazin
Let's keep looking stuff up and plug the wires in
Until it sets me on fire until life finally gets inspiring
I'm tired and I can't sleep, hungry can't eat
Come walk across the country with me bruised toes and feet
No one sleeps and no one knows the incomplete
I saw the bird speaking from the beak and I didn't know what to think
So I kept traveling kept it ongoing
I kept babbling as I kept on raveling this long hole I'm in
And there's no way to dig out, get out of my way
There's no thing that the kid can live out of any day
So let's play with the video games and the individual pain that paints the paint in your brain
It's the same as mine is, tie this, time is not existent
Because space is traveling past that be persistent
Ask if you are going to die
I know that you're high that's why I'm low on the ground looking up at the sky
That's where I caught your eyes divided in the clouds
I never provided anything that I didn't think was purposefully for now
And there's no smile no frown no town
Nothing that is a mountain that's broke-down no sound
Let's go around this is a ghost town
And now how can you try to just get on trial by jury, hurry up and die!
That's what they're saying but what I am displaying
Is just a part of me that makes me want to cave in
And I can't take it
We can turn the volume up
We can turn it down
It doesn't matter what it sounds like the, brain will still turn around
And as it paints and scrapes the inside of the skull
The dull becomes sharper images in this victim-less thing I pull from
So numb, full, come broken and stuff
Wanna give it a little touch?
I fold the bill, I know what's real
Gold rush, adrenaline rush, just a pill
Touch the ceiling, fuck your feelings
You're just a puppet string, now kneeling
Melting down the candle wax and I can't handle that
I'm damaged back jumping on a camel's back I understand the facts
The planet's flat that's why I don't believe in the round
Circular while I'm leaving it down
Perpendicular to believing in sound
I'm leaving it now I bleed in a frown
But I achieve a new smile
Every time that I climb up pull another trick up my sleeve
I'm a child that believes in magic still
It's not a tragic accident that happened it's just a rapid skill
Firing out of my neuron connections
You're on to something that you're off of so what's next man?",https://genius.com/Eyedea-track-1-lyrics
Song About a Song,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"Weird side! Ladies and germs!
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
Your leader and savior, Oliver Hart!
I just wanna send a special, special thank you today
Anyone who donated a little of something in the collection can
God won't forget you
Now see, this next song is a song about writing this song
Now I'm not some profound visionary but this specific incision didn't particularily take too long
I was just running up these backstage stairs
And suddenly it dawned on me
What a good idea, true inspiration
But with no pen or paper to record the creation
I aborted the plans of grand innovation
And stood bored pacing on the wood floor waiting for more wars to pour from my cranium
Maybe I'm not cut out for this writing gig, I thought for a brief second
But then it was like the lightning hit through me in a complete headspin
And kept punching me with phrases concepts rhyme patterns and song structures
A long flux that dropped fire 'til I was finally finished
And in a matter of minutes consciousness is linked with the inventive infinite
And one of my friends happened to have a pen
So I wrote it all down on my hand
That was that
Thank you
We're just gonna
Thank you thank you
We're just gonna pass the collection can around one more time
Try to find it in your pockets and hearts to donate all your money

Red Balloon,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"Excuse me
Excuse me
Yeah, you
Excuse me, excuse me...


Excuse me, I'm looking for my childhood
I remember back when, everything was all good
Now it's hard to stay sane searching for a new name -
But I stay afloat in the stream like we all should
I used to love the cool Summer breeze
And grey days with leaves falling off the trees
Now I know what I miss - I can't hold in my fist but -
One last touch would set me free
Somebody set me free from this trap that you all call the real world
It's all old, but in my heart I'm still young
And my soul says that I should have fun but to have one -
You gotta have some kind of billfold to survive, they say:
""You have to have a job you hate. 9 to 5 every day.""
Pushing you closer to the grave
What do we throw, what do we save?
What do we know, well, what are we waiting for?
Lets lay on our backs and talk about the cloud's shapes
I know all the different memories are floating in the sky
The ones of the earliest years catch my eye
And as you grow, you find new hills to climb -
But there's nothing like doing something for the first time
Yeah now, instead of the sky, I look at the ceiling
Just trying to get a good feeling
So if you talk and I'm giggling
It's not 'cos I'm not listening
I'm just trying to be a kid again


Flipping up these notebooks
Looking for my childhood
Staring at the sunset
Looking for my childhood
Flowing with the music
Looking for my childhood
Walking through this cold world
Looking for my childhood
But were did it go?
(I don't know, it just disappeared)
But were did it go?
(I don't know - last time I checked it was here.)
But were did it go?
(I don't know, it just disappeared)
But were did it go?
(Man I don't know, somebody must have stole my red balloon)


And if I never get anything, at least my name's common enough to always be on the souvenir license plates
The sign says walk and yet they try to cut me off 'cos I was wrong when I thought pedestrians had the right of way
In the center of my innocence, pretense are a percentage of resent for my indolence -
But I can be credited for everything that I finish without a footstep to follow
The walls are full of color yet the ground is so hollow
So what happened to the happiness we had inhabited, the magic averages the year were we stop our imagination -
Start with the education, stifling the childhood, I'd turn us all back into children if I could
I'd turn us all back into children if I could. 
And lead us all to play in the woods



(Excuse me, excuse me.)
Excuse me
Have you seen my red balloon?
I need to catch up with it pretty soon
It makes me complete, while I have a heartbeat
I plan on flying with it to the moon
Why's everybody acting like they grown up?
In a big rush to take on responsibility
I'm telling 'em;
""Stay young, 'cos the day will come, and when it does you can't surrender willingly.""


Now if they're feeling me or not, still, I've gotta get my point across
The coin is tossed into the air into a void of loss
I call both heads and tails, address the trail, and set my sails
But I wanna have fun -
I wanna live like there ain't no tomorrow
With no consequences to my actions - concentrating on my passions
Laughing at the ripples in the lake from the rocks I threw
Innocence of not knowing what's labelled impossible
The curiosity that killed Schrodinger's cat was the only thing that kept him alive -
Matter of fact
I wanna wonder -
Wanna be scared of the thunder and the dark and the figments of my mind that live under my bed
But nowadays your monsters can't be ignored
They demand full attention, and causing a war
For 18 birthdays I felt fine
But I lost my childhood somewhere down the line
For 18 birthdays I felt fine
But I lost my childhood somewhere down the line. ",https://genius.com/Eyedea-red-balloon-lyrics
Just a Reminder,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"God damn (Eyedea), this is some serious gourmet shit!
Back off, I don’t need you to tell me how fucking good my music is okay? I’m the one who makes it. I know how good it is. When y’all go to the studio, you make shit! I make the gourmet quality stuff because when I listen to it, I like to hear it. But you know what’s on my mind right now?
What?
(Random Guy)
Yo, I’m sick of all you stupid motherfuckers talking shit about my man, Eyedea. Matter of fact, if I catch you saying any stupid shit like that around me, I'mma punch a motherfucking hole in your head! Talkin' bout ""Eyedea this, Eyedea that""- get off his dick! And to all y’all critics talkin’ shit, you can eat a dick too, you punk bitches

You got balls stepping up with what you saying to me
I’m probably your favorite MC’s favorite MC
So let these lyrics infuriate your head's interior
Threaded by inferiority complex
Delirium content, please hear when my mouth sets
To tear you into shreds and put your arrogance in its deathbed your best bet's to quit laughing
Unless you’re good at dodging bullets
Ain’t shit gonna happen
Till you shut your trap and learn to focus
Open that overgrown head for a change
And don’t underestimate me in a battle I don’t play
I rip every kid in your clique in five, less than four bars
I’ll take this out to east and west
Don’t test the north star!
Oh are you pissed ‘cause your talent ain’t felt?
Well, this talkin’ shit’s easy, I challenge myself
If you were really dope, you wouldn’t say it all the time
You would be creative and I’d see it in your rhymes
You got the nerve to say I’m soft
Cause the thoughts that I talk
But I think that you’re lost, why don’t you go take a walk?
And find someone who cares how tight you think your style is
Now quit being childish!
Shake my hand and smile bitch!

What gave you the right to have an ego?
You got no skills! It’s obvious an MC’s what you’re trying to be
Well if it gets out of hand, my man, just remember
I’ll always be around to remind you you’re weak!
Rhymesayers Entertainment, you know we be the greatest
With the break and the paints, the cuts, the rhymes and the beats!
Homebase is Minneap, come on through!
And bring your crew
Next time you need to be reminded you’re weak!
(Bridge)
Ayo, look at that Eyedea kid
I don’t even know, man
Yo, that shit he did on the Blaze Battle was kinda tight!
Yeah, no doubt, but his album’s kind of weird!
I know man, he ain’t never gonna get a record deal sounding like that!
True that...

Check me out now!
I’m that kid, who never gave a fuck about a contract
If you need to make a buck, get loose
Rock the mic, but don’t be dumb and come and test me
Kids be jocking like the get-paid bus, swinging from my testes
Inch-by-inch I grow less convinced by those quote un-quote
Battle rappers that think they’re in the triple-leagues
Easily I took their title and I never gave it back
How come my weakest freestyle probably beats they best-written rap?
They doubt it, and then they call me out about it
And I flew off in these topics, I win, and the crowd shouted
And you can say the same but you kid
Beat, lines are skin-deep simply when you wimps become turned into mince meat
But being fresh is only half of the job
There’s a lot in this world that needs to be changed
And so I write each song with a message for humanity
And it expresses the wisdom expressed that’s in my brain
Complaining? No. Just draining pus before the cyst pops
Boy, you player hate, I’m tryna elevate this hip hop!
So stop trying to pretend you’re real
And go write a song someone besides your friends can feel! For real!
Sometimes you just gotta let ‘em know!
Most of these MCs don’t even deserve
To be on a dick like they do
And that’s the truth

What gave you the right to have an ego?
You got no skills! It’s obvious an MC’s what you’re trying to be
Well if it gets out of hand, my man, just remember
I’ll always be around to remind you you’re weak!
Rhymesayers Entertainment, you know we be the greatest
With the break and the paints, the cuts, the rhymes and the beats!
Homebase is Minneap, come on through!
And bring your crew
Next time you need to be reminded you’re weak!

So a masochist comes up to me and says, “I like your record, shit was hot!”

Motormouth’s Anonymous,The Many Faces of Oliver Hart or How Eye One the Write Too Think,2001.0,"So I says to the guy ""Hey, I'm writing a screenplay""
But Pavlov did pair it with an unconditioned stimulus for a reason
And whoever murdered prophecy can expect a prize from me
And at the exact same time in a totally different novel much stickier than this one came the life of a salesman when card houses crumble
Dammit what word rhymes with ""Hide the spike?""
Hey uh... can I borrow one of those cigarettes?
I don't know, I don't smoke

Everyone I know is hollow
So what am I to do I can't follow
Their footsteps If I wanna see tomorrow
I keep my chin even with the sun of the evening
So I don't succumb to the sorrow
Scarred and hardened is my heart of charcoal
The garden of weight to harness equates that of a car load
Borrow me five dollars for the art show
I'll pay you back the day I sell my gargoyle
Hard boil my eggs with a side of cardboard (?)
Carve my name in the barn to alarm all the farm folk
My ego problem's just a parcel
Vertically I cruise currently enthused to surgically remove my barcode
Momma's little boy seems to have some awful bizarre goals
He's not moving 'til the fungus in his jar grows
He's got a hair on his arm for every dart thrown
Hoping the bridge he built of gasoline-soaked yarn holds
For the followers, the deputies and the marshals
And especially the MCs who haven't yet had their card pulled
I roam the streets with a necklace made of shark skulls
And a tooth in the ground that's how I leave my mark

Don't you think American Beauty was way better than Fight Club?
I mean did Einstein reject quantum mechanics because uncertainties for devils or is that flower just not worth plucking?
It's intriguing, jeez this fucking phone cords
I know a song you don't know
I bet this glass will still be see-through next year
Hey uh... c-could you order me another beer?
I don't know, I don't drink

I used to always talk shit about MCs, but then I realized
I gotta grow up one day you see, now I'm more civilized
But, that is why you pitiful guys didn't die when victimized
Cause I still got it in me to bend a sissy and send him to his demise, pus drips from a bitter sky
What's this from is it my karma?
The snake eats its tail Wake me up fail to break free from jail
Flaky and stale's my armor
18 and frail as cardboard It's a hard chore escaping from hell
Pardon me for my language your honor
But lately I feel anguished conquering my inner power
A martyr racing a snail a yard or so behind
I'm wandering through the forest like a poor little coward
How were the head games that you experienced?
I nearly pissed my pants as I missed my chance to be
Seriously advanced
Spiritually enhanced
I'd watch the flame flicker and dance but I can't my man I got plans
I stand strong with my hand on the mic
Tryna freestyle the answers to life
Cause uh, you know I consider myself a pretty good freestyler
Yeah I like the sound of that (So what happens next?)

What happens in that space between ""I love you"" and...
Gödel's theorem suggests certain information can travel faster than the speed of light
But I keep flashing back to the first time I broke my teeth
But I'm on Mars
(...)
So smile strong, breathe good
The writer of this riddle is dead
Walking, walking, running, left

What's really going on? (repeat til fade)",https://genius.com/Eyedea-motormouths-anonymous-lyrics

Speaking of out there
SPEAKING of out there
Where's he from?
He's from some other planet, I heard
He traveled...

I think that's a myth
I heard about that kid
That one from St. Paul

No... heh... no
He ain't from St. Paul

Well, he says he's from St. Paul
But no, I think you're right

Yeah, he says he's from St. Paul
Cause it's, it's more marketable when you talk about you're from Earth
But check it out
It goes a little something like this...
He dug deep in his system to find nutrition for others
Lost sleep, tossed and turned, only to learn love is expensive
Talk was cheap, till my thoughts grew feet
Now I take them on walks with me
But don't let them off the leash
Cause they might cross the street and get hit
Listen a second, I pretended to need a friendship
With many forms of energy till everyone repented
Now I'm end this with a sentence(?) and a sentence become a way of life
To stay the night with my notebook, then wake up the next day to write
Again, and again, and again and again and again and again
Until my pen is inevitably inseparable from my finger skin
Lingering in the depths of this pool of resendential
Fighting a million and ten inner battles that'll sprain my neck into dudes(?)
Bobbing my head to keep cool, true, stays on the down low
Meaning proof for the bleeding, is it useful in the council
Meaning it cheaper what you believe to be the dopest at the moment
Yeah, he's exceeding the quotient and feeding me tokens
But the machine must be broken

Cause he'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So he steady throwin jabs just to get him to look
Man, every thought he ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push
Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look

For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push

From the north side to the southside, to the wild side to the pesticide
To the genocide to the homicide, you decide to set aside
Well, pick a side, any side, are you along just for the ride?
Oh me oh me oh my, I wish you would just die
Cause kid, you're the reason for my sore throat
Petty more dope(?), the war won't stop till you hop in a porthole
And sort those problems out, child, it ain't all about your style
Cause you could break your back to state the facts and make them smile
While the pain in my religion, paintin by the pigeons
Strainin while you're listenin to this brain on tire ribbons
Givin a splittin headache with energetic delivery
Livin as a poetic shredded by the edge of misery
Vividly describin the pain inside of this entity
Physically and mentally, we all pretend to need sympathy
Interesting enough, you say you don't give a 
But there's much I grew to like through this mic that I clutch
So keep your hands down, and put your attention span up
Understand now, man, sound is a dimension you can't touch
Plants crush, when the vocals of that local named Eyedea hit your ear
So c'mon, get your chair and stand up

Because I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give him a push
Rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook
So I'm steady throwin jabs just to get him to look
Every thought I ever had quietly sits in his book
For anyone that's afraid to jump, let me give you a push

Every mama I am(?) with a friendship bracelet and a tin can
Get your business down and dig me up outta the ground when you get rich, man
I'll take a round of applause, but won't take no kids hand
Cause the challenge tonight is to balance my bike without a kickstand
Now a spoon full of sugar makes the medicine go down
In a room full of , well my head isn't in town
I consume what you, shoulda, and assume that the lookers
See the moon and the fact they pushing you to do more than push a broom to
Cushion
Tune rolls to your head, and enables you to see
There really is more to life than bustin  and smokin 
But we proceed to say it ain't fair until we got gray hair
But next time I ask you to think, please don't give me a blank stare

Yo, cause I'd rather give him a uppercut than give him a hook

The root of all evils buried deep within the money
Society's a machine a puppet with invisible strings

The wings we're born with were quickly clipped to fit the form
We're kept warm and senseless, your shepherd's relentless
Every genius was considered a madman in his time
From Jesus all the way down the line to Einstein
And people are so naive to believe
They chose their frame of mind
You're conditioned so you don't provoke
While the plan is in the prime
That's why things like alcohol were designed
I'm not paranoid, you're just blind and that's fine
If you never wanna find out who invented the game
And told you can only use 12 percent of your brain
Nowadays if you believe in aliens you're perfectly sane
But a century ago a thought like that would get you chained

At its beck and call, let's set you all up against the wall
At its will, will even kill or be still my beating wrecking ball

Till you not only get the point but till you believe

Why do you think marijuana's illegal?
Because it's green? Different? And not good for people? (No)
It's chemicals access a dormant circuit of consciousness
Which could potentially change the brains thought process
And why don't the government want you to change the way you think?
Because if you thought about what they do then you might start a revolution
So their solution is to try to stop its circulation
Paying millions a year cause they fear its provocation
They did the same with peyote, mushrooms and DMT
And prohibited scientists to experiment with LSD
They put Timothy Leary in prison because he used it
But the CIA secretly tested it on college students
They stripped the product from the natives and the highly educated
Then put it on the black market so the users would be aimless
With the right guidance, we could benefit from all of the above
But if it's not there, it's just a drug

At the request of his greatness
We filled in all the negative spaces
With void stamps to stand on
Some hands-on experience
Stampede extravaganza cautionary gone and heeded
By the majority of the uprooted seedlings

 Burn the books, push the heroine, assassinate the speaker
 You need some dream sweetener!
 But I ain't asleep no more!
 Throw the scientist in prison and legalize free thought
 You need some dream sweetener!
 But I ain't asleep no more!

At the emperors request
We've undressed all the children
Stripped the process of the consciousness building
At the request of the emperor
We've ventured from the center of the thought
So we can package it and market it to be bought

And what do you see advertised on almost every billboard sign?
But wine ain't always the answer, so once upon a time
They flooded the streets with heroine
To stop the rise of the Black Panthers
They keep us doped up and psychologically clamped
The projects is just a concentration camp
Don't say we can't kill the system

Your momma bought some new shoes
So you could look cool but you don't
You not dope
I grab the mic and leave you broke
Emcees, it's done
Drop the mic, go home, you just got smoked

That was cute... like a plush toy
Now half of that shit you just said
You bet it wasn't hype
You know what the girls call me?
They call me Nestlé Snipes
And they all say
He's a warm chocolate latte
But you's about to get popped up
Take your rock, hey
Dude you know better than to fuck with me
Why you mention my crew?
Why you mention everything about my momma?
What the fuck you do?
Where your album at?
I wish I had something to say
Hey, I like the way that you was rapping, but I ain't heard nothing today
Now, where your tape? Now, where your CD?
Answer me
Where your money?
You been around the world? say it funny
You lost, you lost, you lost, you lost
I wish your ass was a frisbee cause you straight getting tossed

Yo, this battle about to take it
A frigerator getting tossed?
That shit don't even make sense
Try to say it
I grab the mic and get props
I don't got an album but if I did, I quick with it get dropped
Like your whole crew, I got respect for you
But still up on the microphone
I be dissecting you I wreck the crew
Guaranteed do
Emcees like you is queer
You used somebody's little dick to pierce both your ears, you're weird
Fuck, now cease with that shit say
Look at his dopest song, it was ""Six Tray""
Don't give a fuck about their weakness
Peace you can't freak this
What I say
Take your ass back to L.A

Let me tell you
You fucked up again son
You done slipped
You gonna end up mentioning another one of my songs
So you's a dickrider, you been listening, rehearsing
Hold up, wait a minute
I'm producing by the person
From a bitch nigga you damn ho you should be gone
I can't believe you wanted to come here and try to play strong
You want to try to tell somebody to go back home
Nigga, I could take you there today and you wouldn't survive in L.A
I could show you where to play
I could take you take you to the hood
I could make you sit down with the homeboys and they could give you some good tips
But you still want to come up here and act like you the man
Who's about to get diced, sliced, creamed, spit, hope you like getting sliced
Crush that bullshit


All right
Check it out
I'm first
And you're the next to rhyme
I'm eating you up
Not the first time but second time
The last time the judges gave you a break
But I'mma show you that you're fake
Take your legs and break them
I like that little intimidating expression you're trying to give me
Emcees try to step to me
I get up in your kidney
Fuck you up like cocaine
Silly fake gold chain
You can't hang
Blowing your brains out like Cobain
So try to bring it with that style you ain't intimidating
Penetrating, lyrically creating
You're just faking it
I don't know what to say
I did this once before
But I'm gonna smoke you up quick
Like a blunt
You whore

Six million ways to lose a battle
Choose one
First of all, you standing on stage
You done choose one
That choose me
Battle P, know what you gonna do
I should set your ass free
And bust yours too
But, look, homie
While you was listening to my tapes
I was back in L.A., trying to make some paper
And do this shit the right way
But you was on some flow shit
Getting up in this motherfucker
Coming with that bullshit
Man, look, I don't like physical exertion
All I like to do is get here and get in your nerves and
Bounce all around like a fucking basketball
Off the chair, off the lens, off the turntable
On that
Back

(Host: Final round)
(P.E.A.C.E: Come hard, come hard, or lose it)
OK. I'mma come hard
Check it out
The only way you win is if I let you win
The difference between me and you, testosterone, estrogen, whatever
Girly boy
You can't go the noise
You just annoyed
Want to be like the Beastie Boys
No, I don't even want to say this
You's alarming me
You bit your whole style from Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
 steady
I dissed you like that
With a tight rap
Emcees don't know how I just be fat
When Eyedea's straight grabbing the microphone, rocking the lecture
That cheap shirt, you'd look good with a pocket protector
Thinking you're fresher
Emcees is 
Your name is P.E.A.C.E
(Host: Time!)
Well I'mma leave P.E.A.C.E. in pieces

Listen you, listen you
You punk ass, pussy ass nigga
Let me tell you something
You done lost your figure eight, ah
Trying to go straight, ah
when I jumped off of it
I landed in the water did a backstroke splashing
Are you loving it?
I'm worse than the Little Mermaid
Trying to tell you where she gonna go but she can't
But hey
But I can jump the beat and I can jump the rhythm
All I give you what you looking for
Talk about me all day
Still can't beat me with the floor
I don't give a fuck
Tell that DJ to turn the beat down
Tell him, right now, say it, say it
Tell him stop
(Eyedea: No)
(Eyedea laughing)
Tell him. Tell him stop
(Eyedea: Stop the beat)
Stop the beat
Now, free!
Ah, two times, free, free, free
Three times, free, free
(Host: Time!)
 I bust the floor like nobody

It makes up one half of the yin and yang

Yeah!
Right now you coolin' in the place to be with ME, the E-Y-E
Just wanna give a crazy shout-out to all the original Headshots
Shout to Paul Minneapolis. 
Rest in peace to my man Sess
And uh, this just, you know, a little something I wrote... just a little something for fun. Check it out
I rhyme for the fuck of it what else would I do
I rhyme for the love of the excitement and juice
I rhyme for a lot of reasons but one reason that I rhyme
Is to remind you that I'm way better than you
I walk into the show, you know I'm the one
Challenge me if losing your life is your idea of fun
But think about it kid, you see me getting tooken
By some over-confident young buck, just turned twenty-one
Dumb dummy done drunk all the spiked punch
Mike ain't no punk, I will never be nobody's lunch
Step aside, You would never hit a fly
Check that pride 'fore I wreck your vibe
May I suggest a side
Of Prozac, with your Cognac?
Even though I know you know my flow equals your genocide
Betcha I getcha high
Identity amphetamine, Barbiturate adrenaline
Hallucinogenic opiate overdose, but I won't let you die
I'ma hold you close 'til you recognize
Petrified, shocked, when I rock, all you wretched guys
Better get your gynecologist to polish up your pussy right
Cause I'ma stretch it wide open with this old crooked mic
You don't sound alike or look alike if I'ma let you shook up my fan
I ain't even guessing why
In my book a tight MC has many qualities
But you don't qualify
So I owe you no apology for calling out the fact
That you couldn't write this tight if God was your editor
Squashing Competitors, Shocked all my rhetoric
Clocked 'til I fill up the block Off the exit
To rock every sentence to mock
All the headers that invented to attended when I'm stepping off the stage
And instead of stepping up, they come an ask me for an autograph
And all that rapping in my face, they're just a fan 
I'm thinking
Great, Wait, I get the props When I tend to drop
I'm the center block On the Hip hop fiends

You're under my jurisdiction
Where the purest vision: every lyricist winds missing
Wishin' he carried a pistol
It's such a risky tourist visit
Is it a moral issue
If he came to my home claiming to own
The right to show his might
Hold a microphone and recite that bullshit poem
You ask me he shoulda known we clown clones
And take crowns from fake foes who oppose the throne
With a pen and pad I'm bad to the bone
And even better off the dome if you get me pissed and push me into that zone
You must have had the Jones to get your head thrown
Get slapped brand Pakistan
And sent back home with your wack songs
Either right or wrong
I'm still real
You're silicon 
and styrofoam
Might drill a hole inside your skull
And steal ya soul, ya pride ya goals
And anything else valuable
Cause you're an intellectual coward and I'm an infallible international professional styler
Scholar an attitude and I don't approve of you

Destroy you who seek joy through weak ploy to doubt us
Like we're just part of some novices who  a b-boy crew
With beepers because we was long before
Signing bitch emcees and hearing your blood attach
A razor blade
Catheters to their urethras
Reacting with wisdom
Wanna listen to your raps and then diss 'em
You're lacking a rhythm
So I over-load with the proper techniques to hit you
I'm cruising til it resembles that of a homeless motorcycle accident victim
Doodoo dirty
Who you hurt, me?
You booboo worthy
An immediate cremation, no casket
And your mother?
Nothing but a gentle raping
Courtesy of Carnage wearing a soaked in your haemoglobin FUBU jersey
Ah-ha
Black trash that acts fast
Never having your wack ass
Hysterectomy the apollo song
That clapped all limitless
No hesitance remained at residence
Write a song called
""Fuck Eric B, DJ Abilities is president""
Sucker, I think you should sit this one out
We'll have a better game without you your running your mouth

Pillow Case,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"Now he sleeps with pillow in between his legs
Hoping that his dreams don't haunt him tonight
But they keep on coming back every day after day
He wonders if he'll have them for the rest of his life
Now he quit smoking cigarettes three years ago
Just didn't like the thought of being dead by fifty-three
He don't miss the head rush from the pack of Marlboros
He's just thankful that he was able to break free
He loves to sit under the sun and write his songs
Breaking his addiction proved to him he wasn't weak
But he does still smoke in fact he did all along
The difference is now he only does it in his sleep
And he tries to wake himself when he lights the match
But he has to inhale, he has no control
So he cries, cause he thought he escaped the trap
But it's a reoccurring nightmare and he wants to know

What is a dream (Something to sleep on)
What is a dream (Something he needs gone)
What is a dream (Something that keeps on)
What is a dream (Just a problem with his head)
What is a dream (Something that speaks strong)
What is a dream (Something that we want)
What is a dream (Something he'll sleep on)
What is a dream (He doesn't want to go to bed)

Now he met this young girl around the same time
He dropped his smoking habit and began it in the dreams
He let her in his life because he needed to shine
And she was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen
And he grew three years long, two hearts wide
And immeasurably deep, they were perfect together
And he knew somehow, he felt on the inside
That no matter what the weather it'd be him and her forever
Their hands interlocked 'till the end of routine
He would never break her heart because the love is so real
And he can't seem to stop having these dreams
Where he solemnly commits adultery against his will
And he tries to wake himself because he loves his girl
But he has to take it all, he has no control
So he cries 'till he's out of his subconscious world
It's a reoccurring nightmare and he wants to know

What is a dream (Something to sleep on)
What is a dream (Something he needs gone)
What is a dream (Something that keeps on)
What is a dream (Just a problem with his head)
What is a dream (Something that speaks strong)
What is a dream (Something that we want)
What is a dream (Something he'll sleep on)
What is a dream (He doesn't want to go to bed)

Now he bought a couple books to help him understand
What was going on on the inside of his brain
He thought if it persisted he may lose his stance
And was told that was step one to going insane
Every night it's the same, either one of the two
Lighting up a cigarette or cheating on his woman
And he fights constantly in his head what to do
Cause what he does in his dreams, in real life he wouldn't
No control, makes him skeptic of everything else
He don't trust himself cause dreams can come true
His soul is agitated from its image itself
And he wants to be happy but don't know what he's gotta do
So he walked one day, through the woods for miles
With the waterfall below he stood at the edge of a cliff
When he talked, he heard an echo so he exhaled his Marlboro, grabbed his dick and screamed
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit
Dreams are bullshit

What is a dream
Dreams are bullshit (x10)",https://genius.com/Eyedea-pillow-case-lyrics
Track 4,Duluth is the Truth,2009.0,"Head heavy
Left on the shoulders
Dead dead dead dead dead me till I'm over
I let my breath bleed all over your colder
Shoulder that you try to flip over
I know words might seem the same
But I can see a light beam that's pink in my brain
I called it this living information in my frame
But theirs nothing left that I have to paint
Can you guys give me one second
Cause I wanna try to catch it
And I wanna make sure that when its dissected
I wreck it
I give it a second
Fuck it I give it a minute
Because time and space don't mean shit if the earth ain't spinning
Cause that's how we define the lines that we set
Between the stars and the universe's design
It hurts but I'm fine
Because this is the type of person I am
I'm built to climb any mountain and any galaxy
And anything that lives inside of me, inside of me
And here it goes
The hero knows that he can't save the break brave
So he grows up to be another dead human being
Walking around like a zombie
Not even achieving anything and his dreams bleed right into his brain
They go into his life while hes awake
And I don't know what to do about him
Can't give him advice
Cause I don't really have shit to tell anybody about life
Cause if they looked at me and followed my device
They'd be stuck in my same crisis
Grasping on the light
And there's nothing but darkness inside of the heart compartments
And so the second you started
My heart skips a couple beats
I don't know how to breathe
I know what you can achieve
I know when you wanna leave
I can read it in your eyes
No tricks up the sleeve
I can beat it till it dies
And finally lives in me
Live inside of me until the day that you die
Because I know that when you touch the sky, you don't get too high
Your mine and your this design
That's inside your genetic code I can't let it go
Cause I'm still possessed by the flesh
That I just got stuck inside of
Inside of my best parts of my head
And my heart and my death
And the start of this little spark
That left me undressed
And I don't know how to contest
Because there's a part of me that thinks your the worst
And best part of me thinks your the best
And yes is a no
Its the same answer
Its the pain
Its climbing the cancer in your brain
I try to advance
I try to dance with you to this flame
But the candles not lit enough
So I explain why the light is not holding up to the sun
Why I'm alright even though I'm overdone
Why I feel like I'm alive even though I'm numb
Why I feel like I'm gonna die
Even though I'm someone that is meant to be alive
For as long as I can finally be living inside of a song
Or living inside a breath
Or living inside a death
I still try to write it till the destiny is dept
And there's no part that can be part of the whole
And there's no excuse for getting loose from the noose you hold
The truth was told back in the days
And I can still feel it
It's real to me so I say everything I can
I still wanna be your friend
Even though I wanna crawl it up my skin
I wanna just dig back into the fetus
In the fetal position
I wanna cut off my ears and find a way to finally listen
I wanna try to ride it in this new position
I wanna provide my light, my mind with new decisions
I wanna stop living in the shit that I live in
I wanna stop taking from you while still giving
I wanna get rid of this old religion
I wanna just break it then gap the bridge
And move on til I can live for my children
That I still don't have
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
Living for building
I'm living for building and if I'm not alive
I probably was killed then",https://genius.com/Eyedea-track-4-lyrics
Dead Wallets,Movement 4:6,UnKnown,"I've robbed myself on the ability to see the mountain by focusing on the mole hill you made and telling you all about it
Now you tip-toe around, careful not to awaken the problem
As long as it's asleep you call it solved
All flaws forgotten
Step within a mile
You can smell the self-loathe
Death of an only sundial
Made touch and hell helpful meltdown, burn up
Side-to-side, ache
Lovers know each other
How'd it feel when you imagined my face?
I hurt
Strangled by the money dirty bloody taste
You hurt
But we live to fight and fuck another day
Shut your eyes butterfly and trust the skies
I had enough of my shit too

But Romeo never got his way by faking a laugh

Drive to Doolittle,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"(Hey, where you going, man?)
We measure time by how much we think we've done before the sun sinks and leaves the sky
(Where the hell are you going?)
(Where do you think you're going, man?)
(Where do you think you're going, man?)

Some people say the town Doolittle doesn't exist
They dismiss it as a myth but I've visited this abyss
It isn't labelled on your map, but it's easy to find
And it is a fact; everyone goes there at least twice a lifetime
Me? I've been around many occasions - for too long
See, I never plan on staying
Are you strong? Be
'Cos if you're not; start praying
That your demons will let you leave this unbelievable vacation
My neighbors love the scenery - personally I hate it
It caters to your behavior to make sure you don't escape it
If it was my choice, I'd glue myself in the basement
But I'm tempted by a city with tattoos that sleeps naked
It's a modern Sodom and Gomorrah type of town
I wish I just had enough guts to burn it down
But while the dog pets the fish and the wolves play the fiddle
I put my ride in gear 5 and drive to Doolittle

Do a lot
Do a little more than usual
Well, I do it musical
You do your do's
And do it beautiful
Wipe the dew off the grass
Wipe that 'don't' out your ass
Don't ask
To go to Doolittle - you know that I'll pass

Hey yo, sometimes I write a song and it takes me home
I can't stand being stuck in such a place all alone
I see the city through different eyes
Now that I've grown a little substance in the mushy rub and tug by my headphones
See Doolittle's both nowhere and everywhere
It's got what you need from LSD to teddybears
A wise man told me, to go anywhere, except for there
Although most people like it better there
To explain it on a level, some blame it on the devil -
And run aiming rocks and pebbles at a book because it settles their adrenaline -
But I'm ahead of them, I know the  it's  introduce my Human flaws
See, it puts you in the days of euphoric limbo
You can't just quit it, it ain't that simple
And on my way to school some days I turn to look out the window and I'll see a sign
It'll say; ""Two blocks to Doolittle""


Ayo, I block myself in an imaginary box
Keeps me off the streets of Doolittle's Writer's Blocks
It's got your goals in a chokehold that I don't know
Where it comes from, how it starts, or why it stops
I'm tying knots to close that section of my brain
Baby, you relate it's just yours has a different name
Maybe, yours is sex, drugs, rock and roll, apocalypse, -
Impossibles, greener season obstacle, any reason not to grow
There it is, in the window of your shopping mall
Reality is heavy, watch it stall when you drop a load
I suppose my list, is just as long as any
And maybe even twice the size of the average MC's
I need to stop thinking and start writing
Drop the conversation and pick up a pen
Doolittle? It's a town made of personal laziness
And I'll never go there again, I don't believe in Doolittle

(Doolittle is located right between your ears)
Do little, do a lot, How much you do this year?
(Yo, you find it in your brain if you're even partly sane)
Do little, do a lot, do nothing, do the same
Well when your inspiration's dry and you don't even know why
Just chill, I guarantee the feeling will pass you by
Indolence is in the head, and if it's leaving you disturbed
Well close your eyes and repeat these words
Check it out, say:
""I'm in control of me""
Then say:
""I'll be what I wanna be""
Say:
""No-one can say I'm wrong""
Say:
""I'll try 'till the day I'm gone""
I don't believe in Doolittle",https://genius.com/Eyedea-drive-to-doolittle-lyrics
The Breaks,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"Dear Mrs Burden
This is very hard to say, but I sincerely hope that you're doing alright
I know my attempts will never ease your pain
But since it happened I truly haven't slept a night
I'm haunted by her innocent face
Each breath I take reflects my mistake
I never wanted to be the end of someone's fate
Mrs Burden, my scars grow deeper every day
I know tomorrow she would have been eight
If it wasn't for my irresponsible methods of escape
I understand why I'm subject to your hate
But I swear she came out of nowhere and by the time I hit the brakes it was too late
Crash, crumbled, the castle in my head
My body froze when I saw that little girl was dead
And on the side of the road I heard the mother crying
At the corner of ignorance and life I ran a stop sign
I wish I could go back in the past and not drink that last glass
The day altered eternity and I can't stop thinking of how it probably wouldn't have happened if I wasn't drinking
And now I swallow this holy water
I'm sorry that I murdered your only daughter
I'm not writing this to gain your forgiveness, but only to show my suffering as honor
Oh why did I survive and a child died. I wish it was the other way around
She had so much ahead of her, so much to live for, and that so much is nothing now
Mrs Burden, Mrs Caroline Burden, 
I don't expect my apology to bandage your burns
But each instant, remorse slowly eats at the core of my heart
If I'd have only kept my car parked
Now every time I close my eyes I hear that girl's cries
I'm not comfortably numb like the criminals you despise
Even though I'm physically unable to run from it
This jail sentence is the lightest of my punishments
It was an accident and in hell I'm burning
On my cell wall is a silhouette of one Felicity Burden
Who was introduced to death at a young age of six
In broad daylight a block away from where she lives
I got off work early so I stopped at the bar
Then not using my head I hopped in my car
Intoxicated speeding home to surprise my wife and my child
I was so close, but yet so far away
So now I swallow this holy water
I'm sorry that I murdered your only daughter
I'm not writing this to gain your pity
But I hurt too, for god's sake Caroline, don't forget I was her father
And I always will be
And still am
Sincerely yours with love forever
William D. Burden
I'm sorry, that's all I can say
I'm sorry",https://genius.com/Eyedea-the-breaks-lyrics
Even Shadows Have Shadows (Spoken Word),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I stand alone
Burned every bridge over the troubled water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
A stronger tide is coming and I've been running
Trying to function fine with out my mind
Climbing out this f**king corner
I was born a thorn away from the rotten petals
A forgotten rebel
Passed through the absence of parentally hands
To develop an evident level of benevolence
So it's probably better I sold my sold to the devil
This is a message to anyone I met that thinks they know me
Don't pretend to understand any of the issues that I'm holding
I was in a rush to grow up, look Mom no cuts
Just a stomach in disgust, and the fear
That I might go nuts this year
If I don't swell up I'll see you one my way
One day this shit'll kill me but I guess that it's OK
I've lost all fate in a world so full of hate
I don't f**king love music I just use it to escape
I'm caught between wanting to punch someone in the face
And putting a bullet in my head to leave the human race
Everything takes its toll but there's no tolls I can take
I haven't yet found a good reason to be awake
Introducing the corroded bumps I had behind my smile
I'm angry at the universe for the way she treats me now
And keeps me down, stealing all my energy
I'm feeling like my enemy, concealing my identity
Not dealing with my tendencies
I peel the skin and then I squeeze
The real imprinted Hanse's disease
Not human in this century, I'm ill until the entity
Who built this penitentiary, It's filthy as a centipede
And guilt was in his sense cause he was willing to
Just let me breathe, While I wore a game face
In 10 years don't check for me I'll be in the same place
This planet is just an overpopulated mental hospital
Each zombie walks around constitutes another obstacle
So here it is I'm finally coming out my shell
All 19 years of my life have been in conflict with myself
I'm insecure by every facet of the existence
From my addictions, to the conditions I choose to live in
Who you kidding I suffer from excess anxiety
A product of pollution in American society
Stare into my eyes and see the hell that burns inside my mind
And I no longer have an ego I can hide behind
But I've been trying disregarding my insanity
Every form of hurt isolates me from humanity
But it's provoked against being force fed
So F**k education for a decade and 3 years
Of headaches from my peers
Cause now I realize I could have learned more on my own
They taught me how to know everything except my soul
Which is everything I need to grow
Everything that keeps me whole
Everything that ever meant anything to Eyedea
So I leave with golden hope
To rip the beast that holds my focus
But the fact remains the same, I'm still bound by chains
It doesn't matter if your chain is 10 ft or 100 ft
The fact remains the same, you're still bound by chains
So people say I've changed, and it's harder to relate to me
Good, I never liked you our friendship was make believe
I'm peeling the mask back and revealing the rap thespian
Feeling my organs drilling distorted short portions
Of morbid acid keeps the torture unfortunately crafted
Interests to orbit my portrait and inflict my image with disorder
The minutes get shorter, the walls start to close in
Feels like the brain is hanging on but with clothes pins
I've hidden in the darkness for too long
I make it look all right but in the inside its so wrong
I want life to change but I don't know if it can
For a man or machine or whatever the f**k I am
I stand alone burned every bridge over the trouble water
No longer hiding from my personality disorder
You want to die in my life then come and stay
In madness' favorite little corner
Cause even Shadows have Shadows
And my secrets are eating me eagerly feeding
I scream in my dreams Away but they keep on defeating me
Even Shadows have Shadows
Welcome to the dusty subconscious of an actor
Who murdered his childhood to stop the audience's laughter
Even Shadows have Shadows
I'm about to break free from my fears
When I don't like what I see
And I can't feel what I hear
Even Shadows have Shadows
So don't judge a book by it's cover
Cause my story is f**ked up as any other!",https://genius.com/Eyedea-even-shadows-have-shadows-spoken-word-lyrics
Ode to Hip Hop,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"I've decided to take my destiny into my own hands
You probably can't understand but for me life is bland
And I have this constant hollow feeling
Days are cold, dark and filled with sorrow
Raining clouds from under my ceiling
Dealing with it all would take a person very strong
By the time you hear this, I will be gone
Along with my existence will be a way of life for many
I gave some substance, knowledge
And in return was used to make a petty penny
They've defeated my purpose, deleted my work
Cheated me, seated me underground and wound up bringing me to the surface
They corrupted my image, made me a negative influence
This shady world has been abusive ever since I came into it
Put here with no role models, no one to follow
I've been contorted, aborted, recorded distorted shorted
I forfeit against life, I'm a morbid maniac
Forced off this rough course, breaking the boards and making my own doors
So don't be sad when I leave because I know this is right
I can't take it, I can't fake it, I'm sick of life

I carried people through hard times and thought they were my friends
But they only stayed close to me cause it was the trend
And when I'm gone, no one will miss me
A few years will go by important people will die
And y'all will forget me
I hope the children will be alright without a proper guide
To all my loved ones and followers
Peace out at least I tried

I ain't what I used to be so don't shed a tear from your windows
I died a long time ago this just makes it official
I ain't what I used to be so don't shed a tear from your windows
I died a long time ago this just makes it all official

I, hip hop, being of sound mind and body
Hereby request that my few prized possessions go to the following:
Swallowing the facts that may be whacked by the track
Still beauty stands from stained hands and knapsacks filled with aerosol cans and fat caps
My abstract artistic energy must continue
To influence and embody the caps that are dedicated to ruining white walls
With creative strokes of imagination in the paint (splash)
I leave all my physical strength to the guardians of the floor
With their arms locked in a b-boy stance
Enhancing the culture to the more ultra-advanced acrobatical expression
Yes indeed when I leave, my presence will exist in the style
Of the few true but who knew
Smiles would persist with the changing mood
I leave my mood to the...
Musicians, turntablists, and wicked wizards of needles dusty sampling tangible vibe-setting rhythm scientists
It's my verbal aspect of my that goes to those riding, vocalizing
Poetical hybrids of life and excitement
Language of the tongue
I offer all my offspring the official mission towards society
The gift of words come and get you some
Yeah, the gift of words come and get you some
And my positivity, creativity, originality, and history should be spread equally over all that is mentioned above
Along with my many styles: aggression, knowledge, evolution, solution, revolution, tolerance, and love",https://genius.com/Eyedea-ode-to-hip-hop-lyrics
Weerd Syed,The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"Why they always looking at me, like there's something on my face man
No matter where I go, I'm always feeling out of place
And I know I'm not your regular I got a different taste
Probably cause most my life, spent right in my basement
I didn't watch the Super Bowl, don't drink alcohol
Don't carry I.D., don't go to the mall
I'm extra argumentative and really good at fast talk
I can't dance or sing but I can rap my ass off
Hey my voice is unique, I'll leave it at that
But no rapper you know, has the ideas I have
And it ain't like the skin color really is significant
It puts you in the category of art fag or idiot
But I don't try to fit in
My life's like a novel of science-fiction
My mission is to get into your mind, and make you listen and
Rewind what you were missin', everytime that you insisting to be blind
I paint a picture with the rhyme and climb the instrument
I'll hide behind a picket fence, slice a little wickedness and I
Win at this so you better bet on me
I only smile in public if I got a lot of energy
Don't go to the doc, I got my own remedies
Oh and I almost forgot I got a really good memory

I know a lot of people that'll tell you that they hate me
Cause they know I bring out the weird side
Some say I'm a genius others say that I'm crazy
But they all say I'm a little on the weird side
It ain't like I can help it, it's the way my momma raised me
So I'm living every minute on the weird side
Here's a ticket for the train, pay a visit to my brain
If you wanna know about the weird side
It goes dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do

I only write with a certain type of pen (chameleon)
Switching from an itchy introvert to loudmouth
First thing I do after I buy a CD is open it up
And see if my name's in the shout outs
I read books on yoga and quantum mechanics
Psychology, philosophy, peyote and acid
I like Jimi Hendrix more than any rap shit
And my favorite movie's Dr. StrangeLove, that's a classic
Never had a fist fight, got knocked out one time
Stupid motherfucker thought peace was a gang sign
Yo I never liked the circus I was too afraid of clowns
20 years in the same city still don't know my way around
And still get lost inside of my thoughts
Saying dumb jokes just to hear myself talk
Yeah I know my clothes probably need to be washed
But I like em' and if I didn't I would take em' off

I know a lot of people that'll tell you that they hate me
Cause they know I bring out the weird side
Some say I'm a genius others say that I'm crazy
But they all say I'm a little on the weird side
It ain't like I can help it, it's the way my momma raised me
So I'm living every minute on the weird side
Here's a ticket for the train, pay a visit to my brain
If you wanna know about the weird side
It goes dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, da doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, da doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da Dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, da doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do
Da dee-dee-da, dee-dee-da, doo-doo-do, doo-doo-do

I'm not accepted by any certain group of people
I'm a walking talking freak-show and by now you know my steelo
Everybody's weird, you know that's true
I bet you even got a little bit of weirdness in you
My lyrics are due to depression, and an essence impression, unprecedented
Identity, representin' the Midwest I guess I'm just ahead of my time
Blame my pedigree, I'm telling you a tale of the time, embellish the melody
Who are you to say I got a few loose screws, dude?
The tools humans use can never measure my texture
Extra, extra read all about it Eyedea's an extraterrestrial don't let him
Touch you or even sit next to you
Hey I don't write, so you're wrong and that makes me right
Song after song, night after night
Gonna spit my words into the mic
And they probably react nice if it's something they like
Now is that so strange to want the attention
If you think I should change, man save your suggestions
I swear someday I'm gonna be somebody's hero
But until that day I'm just another fuckin' weirdo",https://genius.com/Eyedea-weerd-syed-lyrics
Glove,"When in Rome, Kill The King ",2010.0,"Run from the feeling
Lay the lonely down
Fill your hopes with someone else now
You could turn this city into a new town
As long as you find someone new to be around
Don't trust your choices
Run when you get sore
Eager for the next chapter
Still stuck in the one before
You could turn this city into a new town
As long as you find someone new to be around
Run from the feeling
Lay your empty down
Fill your hopes with something else now
You took his hand and crammed it into your glove
But just because it fits, doesn't mean that you're in love
Everything is old
Everyone's alone
Everything is old
Everyone's alone",https://genius.com/Eyedea-glove-lyrics

(Long day at work... I wonder what's on the radio?)
""Now that I'm working out and conversing-""
(Now that I'm working out...)
""Macintosh""

The drugs
Say no to me
I broke emcees with
Poetry blowing holes in me
When I broke yo teeth
I go off this beacon
(What?)
(Hey baby, baby)
What, what, what?!
(Come here, come here!)
(It's that kid from Blaze Battle)
What do you want?
What do you want, man?
What the fuck do you want, man?
I don't give a damn who-
(Listen!)
Man
You gon' have me here listening to this shit, man?
(Hell yeah!)
Turn this shit off man

Deleting you, deleting them, deleting men
I'm eating them, defeating them
Leave them weaklings
Been up in the weekend
I be serving them
Words is dumb cause I urge them-

(Turn that shit? Turn that shit back!)
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about
Oh yeah, that's my jam
(Turn that shit back! It's Eyedea!)
Hey what are you doing?
(I'm saying, do you know who this is?)
Fuck that shit I'm up outta here
(Bye)

Emcees try to step up
My dick is what their lips touch
Bitch, what?
They want to try to step to this
I recommend that they couldn't fuck with me
If they was down with an exorcist
Because I got demons and they got semen
Guaranteed beating me, hah, shit
I guarantee they was just dreaming
Keeping that shit tight
Every weekend speaking on this motherfucking mic
I keep that shit tight, locked like a door knob
Emcees try to step, I'm a rich cat they're a poor slob
Don't even try to step to this
I recommend that
When they ask their friends that
I just blast their ends in glass and shatter their chin
I'm badder on the patterns from Saturn and back
The raps is just gathering and fathoming
No imagination and I grab reputation
On the microphone
I grab the microphone and they be pacing slow
Breaking those, taking notes throw it often
Emcees try to step to me
They know they flowing soft
When we get through the jam
Emcees know you the man, please flow
I be grabbing the mic and making it stop
Like a bus depot
We blow so ill though
When I grab the microphone I stick like a dildo
When rip with the kill flow
So kid try to step
Terrell grab the microphone and take all their reps!
Who the sickest?
Who the quickest?
Who can lick this?
Who's the sickest?
Who's the quickest?
Who can lick this?
Yo my nigga Carnage, Carnage

Carnage, Carnage never talking that garbage
Emcees I be scrubbing the tarnish
Off of their ass quick
Melting like plastic; quite sarcastic
When I grab the microphone emcees be
All smelling like fucking ass dick and
Any other thing that be smelling kinda funky
The rhyming junkie guaranteed to blast
Every emcee swinging like a monkey
In the motherfucking jungle I
Swung your lyrical style way off into another orbit
Yes I'm morbid; more shit
Cause when I be kicking
Emcees I be ripping and
Thinking of taking you
And you wouldn't even be stepping up to
These lyrical flows that I be using
Swiftly ripping the mic
Flipping the track
Never the one to be coming wack
Always the one to be smacking 'em
On their motherfucking back
When they be fucking wack
Think that they can hang with the way
That I burn a reflection
Don't y'all wanna be wise
Til I get an erection
My selection
Symbolizing
Nothing but
Pure perfection
I take them out with verbal aggression
That's what I be using
Emcees I be abusing with the rhymes I'm choosing
Guaranteed to never be losing a motherfucking battle
Emcees should
Go get a saddle and ride off try to get with the team
Gotta realize that my
Motherfucking rhymes are never soft
I be the lyrical boss when it comes to flipping that fast shit
Emcees running up to the microphone
And guaranteed to get their fucking ass kicked

No shopping rocks on the block
Cocking Glocks; better not
Hopping spots when it's hot
When I'm dropping props on the spot
My rock is not gonna stop
Shocking watts til you flock

Dropping crops til you're fucked
To watch you flock to the jock
You talk a lot of shit that you can't back up
And I'm not nervous cause
You're an insecure bitch that acts tough

The the the the
The fact is e g a n r a c

Carries the weight of
Vocabulary heavy enough to leave your back
Crushed!

Drop before depressed chest
Make heart dark
Stomach plummet
Lyric rivers spleen
Scream knees screes
Find wine in
Back crack
Smash that nap sack
Filled with wack raps
Act black
Niggaro what's in your flow
Abrasive
When I'm packing the heat
You're attracting defeat
If your rapping is weak
Knuckles and feet'll be
Cracking your teeth
When I'm properly
Interacting with beats
Hit the sack and the meat
Chin strong D.C.M
Of king b exhibits an
Ability to crumble
When rumble
Humble still
Downgrade your battle cry
To a feminine mumble
You might fumble away
Stumble
With great parallel to that of
Hyena in the jungle
Mic stand then lodged in bunghole
Plus your rhyme recital booed
Situation avoidable
If I'm just getting the respect
That I'm entitled to

You motherfuckers need to give up the props
And take notes

Today's lesson:
If your lyrics suck
You ain't clear to bust
Fear this cut
Better get used to us 'cause the only
Place we're going from here is up",https://genius.com/Eyedea-prelude-to-coaches-lyrics
Track 3,Duluth is the Truth,2009.0,"Keep that shit poppin as long as the little kid's drop it out of the adult skull I never felt like the vault was full so when I robbed it I tried to stop it before it pulled me apart
I don't owe you a heart I don't even know you I wanna try to sew you a new heart
Inside of ya empty fish tank inside of your chest
I live to give thanks to people who provided the best inspiration for me
Now as I'm ignoring my own thoughts because I walk with them too much they become boring
And I tore things apart so many times that I look at the inside of my mind and it's plenty fine
It's okay it's sunshine it's no day it's lunch time it's crunch time it's all okay as long as you feel fine
I know my mistakes will never fish you on the line I will never give you anything but a kiss to make you feel okay
And as I feel the gray skies break apart I take your heart and hold it to the sky and try to make it art
Let's make it start let's make it stop let's do all the same falling in between the walls you claim
It's the tallest brain a small refrain it's just just the wall and paint different little scriptures that we use for the pictures that we hang on the top of the walls and on the bottom of the thoughts that won't fall
I can't stop I won't stall cos' there's no electric shock that can actually get me alive again there's no rush that will make me feel leviathan I've tried to spend my life doing the same stuff brain tough smushed in mush and that's in my skull there's nothing left to discuss and if it was just us I would say that there would be a theory that I could try to oppose but I feel like you wouldn't hear me
I clearly spoke I got lost in your ghost I can talk circles around the way I think and I can't even cope with the fact that my brain is running on this race track I try to stay back bases are loaded and I've got this bat and there's nowhere to go there's no bleachers and no coach there's no person that can even tell me where the fuck to go
And if I had one I would call it a dad for fun I would just look into my past pull off my mask and not run any more from the sun rays or from the moon or from the attraction in the gravity that keeps us all consumed with reality I'm challenging my thoughts and my structures I was a philosopher as a young kid a dumb mother fucker a stupid shit talking arrogant piece of shit that was trying to live through his parents non-existence every time I walked talked with my lips and walked with this clips lookin at a solar eclipse feelin' like a little piece of shit
Never really gave anything that I couldn't make cos' ever since I was in eighth grade I was still contemplatin my grave
And I couldn't save myself and nobody can save me and I can't break myself cos' nobody can hate me because I can't take myself to the place that I'm escaping

Walking (Mikey Version),The Many Faces of Mikey,2015.0,"All I wanna do is sit here and write
I'm not worried about anything, I'm just living my life
I can't be bothered with anyone else's ideal
Path to success, I pass up that stress
Feel bad for the quest, gasping for breath
Trapped in my head, asking for less rations in death
Passion is left, ashes and just...
Just to sit in the love of an antique box on my window sill
My mask is my flesh, my dream is to grow wings
And sing 'til freedom rings
I got a rhythm but I'm eager to unplug the speaker
And let my heart be my teacher
You're welcome to listen to these words
But I don't know where they come from
I think my soul holds the song of eternity that's undone
It'll never finish, that's the point
But I gotta get going
Thanks for the inspiration

I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
So next time there's a rainbow
I'ma run away from it
So when I turn around
I'll see it while it's strong

I don't care about my whereabouts, I blare it out
I gotta go, that's all I know, I hit the road and find my soul
And they say, ""Listen, if you get a degree, look up and see
What you can be: infinity,"" but everything ain't anything anyway
I see your eyes and realize I need to cry
But even I attempt to hide (?) would be alive so deep inside
Thanks for your help, but I won't find nothing better
In a world this beautiful, I'll be walking forever

I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

On this journey, I don't expect nothing but the unexpectable
The only thing I know for a fact is that I'll never know
Too much about myself, so I'ma keep learning
'Cause I'm determined to find what keeps the fire burning
I'm turning these pages just as slow as I can
Reading every single word from the poet within
I flow with the wind and stay content wherever it carries me
There was no beginning and there won't be an end
I'm just a piece of a galaxy, a seed in the soil
A stream of consciousness, to the seasons I'm loyal
Don't take my movement personal, it's not that I don't dig you
But I can't be on the beach of your sea when it boils
And so I walk with the music 'cause to me it's all that's real
I don't know where I'm going, I don't have a plan
I've been hearing instructions my whole life
And I still think walking away from your rainbow
Will make me more of a man

I'm walking
Not cause I'm mad at you or anyone else
I'm walking
Walking until I find myself

Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
So next time there's a rainbow
I'ma run away from it
So when I turn around
I'll see it while it's strong

Sometimes, the closer you get
The further away it gets
I run towards the rainbow
But when I get there it's gone
And I promise you
If I ever touch a rainbow
I won't turn it into a song

Itchy,"When in Rome, Kill The King ",2010.0,"I don't know what's wrong
It's nothing special tonight
I just feel like I could use a friend
Sometimes I do too much
Itch my way through the high
Everyone needs something to help them hide
If I die before I sleep
Heaven will look just like a dream
If I go up 'fore you do
I'll save a spot in heaven for you next to me",https://genius.com/Eyedea-itchy-lyrics
Best friends (feat. eyedea),UnKnown,UnKnown,"I think this one looks like a fight, between a plate of fruit and my dads exercise bike
I bet if these ants dancing next to my head could fly that high
They would use that cloud as a bed
But my dad said that bugs bite and fly with the wind
And if the sun isn't hung right then run like a fish
We could win if we both try to untie our fins
And climb that pine tree with the swing on it behind the fence
Alright, one, two, three, let's race, I bet that I can beat you there
Last time you ran faster than a grown up when we were here
Remember? I scraped my knee then got stung by a bumblebee
And the old man that lives behind the fence came out and yelled at me
Of course I remember, Oh how could I forget?
He wrote my mom a letter and my daddy threw a fit
But this time will be better I promise as long as we're honest he'll give us permission
Yeah he can't say no to a kid
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's all puppy dog kisses and hugs
So fill my cup with cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleepovers
I don't wanna grow up if it means getting older
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's all puppy dog kisses and hugs
So fill my cup with cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleepovers
No, I don't really wanna grow up if it means getting older
See, what I really don't get is why the big kids never get grounded after playing ding dong ditch
And the slingshots look like mighty fun, wish that I had one
That way I could stand up to bullies, instead of trying to run
Yeah, and they always get the baseball cards from the policemen
Being tall don't make you smart
At least we can always find something to do
Like looking at the clouds with my best friend, That's you
I'm not sure what to say, I'm just happy that we're small enough to look up at the sky and feel okay
And I'd be lying if I tried to say that I don't feel the same way as you do
So let's be on our way it's time to play
Oh, to the jungle gym or to the swimming pool
School's out forever
And I hope I'm never too cool to keep on making my life better
Whether 5, 25 or 80 as long as I'm alive I'm in love and forever changing
I will never turn my back to a lollipop to lick
It's kisses and a hug with love
Fill my cup with a bunch of good things that always feel alright
Cause I'm a little kid, we're all little kids on the inside
Never turn my back on a cupcake
Love mixed with kisses and a kitten with love
Now fill my cup full of cotton candy, ice-cream and weekend sleep-overs
I will never grow up, cause I'll never get older",https://genius.com/Eyedea-best-friends-feat-eyedea-lyrics
Storm’s Coming (Sleep Tight),"When in Rome, Kill The King ",2010.0,"Storm's coming was the talk of the truck stop restaurant
Settle up the green and sky's coming close
Buckle the baby down
Mufflers sound like cellos tuning
Wind like a theremin
She dreams cartoon mice barber shop quartet serenade:
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Sleep tight, baby
Outside it's my shitty car silhouette
Backlit by lightning
Then came the flood
Road fills with mud
Mouth fills with blood
It's time that I tell you where the angels come from
I promise to keep you warm 'til they arrive
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight
Sleep tight, baby

Fortunately Gone,"When in Rome, Kill The King ",2010,"I wait for you, in heaven
On this perfect string of love
And drink your soup of magpies in a pottery bowl
Looks as I am now
Brown, round and warm
Chime on a rain wet
An ankle toes or two
Sweetly as it drops upon your head
Just like it did today
Fortunately gone (Bah bah bah)

They don't want you around anymore (Yeah)
Well you know that my sex face is solely yours
With built-in blush
Super woman glue to stick to your guns
You sure draw a crowd

I have no comment
I'm not your heaven
Unless you cut yourself into pieces I can understand
Die for your causes
I'll be your witness
You don't always bore me
It's just that you can
They fly around my bones
I can't even escape them in death
Find the one who makes the grass green
Then it's off with his head
I have no comment
I'm not your heaven
Unless you cut yourself into pieces I can understand",https://genius.com/Eyedea-lather-rinse-repent-lyrics

Eyedea freestyling in tour van,UnKnown,UnKnown,"With the phat type of flow, and so
When it comes to shattering your goals, I’m
Climbing to the top of the ladder, thought you knew
But you don’t, so you just caught the flu
I be gettin' sick and ripping this ridiculous shit, who
Is the one to fucking serve your whole crew
Every member in it, every contender, and every winter in it
I get it hot, turn it back to summer
It’s no wonder, MCs are just a bummer
Th-Thinking they can fuck with me
But they just can’t
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da


It’s the dream team
The dopest thing your team ever seen
I’ll sever your dreams, these motherfuckers ain’t really steaming hot
Call the kettle black
I’ll rip an instrumental track
And you won’t never get me back

Call the pan frying
Watch how I come hit you with the third eye
And every time I’m climbing to top, to the tip, when we rip
Gotta a grip on the Glock
Watch how I do this shit
When we drop, never stop

Never stop
Shit we never even start to rap
I rip apart a cat
I make your heart just snap
I’m on like that
Even when I’m off
I’m still up in my prime time
I kick a dope rhyme
It’s night time
So shut your eyes, blind

I’ll heart attack you

Kill the light
I drill your life
Motherfuckers don’t really know how to feel the mic
Press play and this cd will keep it going on
Motherfuckers know my flow’s the bomb
You can see a cat
They could never see the raps
I defeat the fat and  on their knee caps
Who the fuck thought they could see raps
We defeat wack MCs
Making babies with my tongue
These motherfuckers got rabies
And they bit me thinking


Hey yo your beats is aight
I’m defeatin' the mic
I’ll teach it
I go out to eat with your wife
Have a little bit of beans and some rice
Then I give her fu-fuckin' dreams for the night
She wants to see me
Rubbing on me kinda like a genie

That sounds like a story about you and my wife, with the beans and the rice
Watch how I gets nice twice, with the device
No I don’t got an apparatus when I’m rappin’
Yo you motherfuckers need practice
Yo that’s just a simile

That’s what happened
Put them in a black hole
Trapped by the shrapnel
Every time a kick a phat flow I let a cat know
Let your backpack broke down on your shoulders
You thinking that you know it but your weak fucking style is over

And if your wack  then I have to let the cat go
Watch how we come through ‘cause I be that phat bro
And I mean that on some metaphorical shit
I weigh a buck fifty and you always act bitch

Even when the track slow, know when the track kind of fast I whip a wack ho
Check the way that I bust motherfuckers like tobacco
Chewing them, doing them, ruin them when I rip the microphone
After the show, bitches, I’m screwing them

I’m hotter than Tabasco
Don’t ask no fucking questions
I’m the dopest motherfucking thing to ever touch a session


Even if the beat is fadin' out
Imma play you out
Rappers never say my name without the clout
So shut your fucking mouth
Rappers really don’t know what I’m about
That’s why I’m sitting in your house next to your girl on the couch
In your own house, turn the motherfucking cable off
You think that your rapping hard? Well I’m gonna make you soft
So take your naval piercings off, so we can kick it phat
Every time I freestyle it sounds better than written raps
I don’t give a fuck, my dick will snap from the way they jockin’
Because I display it often, make rappers lay in coffins


The horns is going, I was born with flowing
I get your girlfriend open doing porn, it’s on man
It don’t even matter when I get to zoning
I don’t even have to plug a fucking microphone in
Do this shit on the couch, do this shit in a van
‘Cause when I’m the man I don’t need to win Scribble Jam
I win titles and I 

 when I win
I grab the microphone and never will I sin
Over the beat, because the horns is coming in
This is how I do it with that Black and Mexican
Tell you every time what my racial background is
Watch how we do it because you know I'm flipping shit
You understand how the medley we'll work it
Grab the microphone like a dick and I will jerk it
Split it over the head like hitting you with a rock
Until you end up dead, watch
How we coming with the beats and the snares and the drums
'Cause it's like that, I'm always having fun
And I'm rising with the sun, 'cause the indigenous Aztec
Ritualistic bitches, every time we do this
Yo, I do it crypsis
Yo, my shit is like that, like the addicts
Ya mother fuckers don't understand
When we rapping all up in your ear hole
Fuck you dude 'cause your shit is kinda wierdo

Who’s the new hero, with the Superman cape
Your crew is so damn fake, I don’t know, your pancake
Made of Bisquick
Jumping on this dick
You thinking your kickin’ sick shit?
That’s why you have a slit wrist made by my razor
I’m the fly fly paper, fly caper
I don’t like thy neighbor
So check out my flavor, I’m greater
The time taker, the rhyme innovator
The earth, space, and time quaker
Either way, I go it broken language
Can’t no one hang with, the flow is strangest
It’s the, it’s the, ill talker, I kill walkers
Spill skills, still pill popper, the ill watcher
The MC killer, the need filler, the beat killer, the iller
The mother fucking caterpillar, turn into a butterfly
Shut her guy, shut your eyes while I kill her
These motherfucking rappers are just filler
That’s the style, it’s the style spitter, the wild kid just to hit ya, then I put a clipper
Under your nose because I got wondrous flows that are so thunderous ho
Hold up, put your thumb on the rose
All you stickin’ is the thorn, I was born to flow
Corn rolls in your head, I’m about to rip them off
My dick is soft, so get the fuck off


It don’t got enough room to hold you and your rest of you family tree
I’m damagin’ MCs for no restitute
Every time I’m wreckin’ you
Mothersfuckers don’t know I’m dissecting you
Protecting you is what your family’s doing
But this man will ruin, any rapper that I’m running through and
They say I’m not human, but who the fuck you doing
I grab the microphone and give it to you, and the crowd starts booing
Like who the fuck are you man?
Who the fuck are you man?
They start repeating it, I start beating it
I feed the dick until you face, until your cheeks rip open
These MCs ain’t even flowing
When it comes to stepping to the microphone, they got no one

 MCs is open, open to any contest
Watch how we come, never ever settle for less
Yo, I'm Buddha blessed, with the weed in my ear
This is how we do it when we coming crystal clear
Like a fucking windshield with rain on it
Yo, y'all mother fuckers can't do it when we bombing on my Babylon shit
Every time we make these beats, yo
Watch how we grip it and we come so complete, yo
Know , but you're not hard
Had to get you harder
Watch how we're coming through but we had to play the martyr
Yo, so you end up dead, in the head
Every time we coming when I fled
Like fucking fugitives, I'm not new at this
Ya mother fuckers better do it, because you ruin it
So you need to stop it
Put on the shelf and let it get dusty
Watch how I'm coming, never rusty like cars in Minnesota
'Cause I'm coming with the snow-er flow-er
Every time I do it 'cause you know it's a roller coaster
On the top of the pendulum, watch how I swingin' 'em
'Cause mother fuckers never bringin' 'em
And when I mean that, what I mean by that is words
'Cause that shit is absurd, every time they play the 
I play the , you understand the difference?
'Cause imma coming in, because you know my shit is significant
Yo, trying to come with different styles, and coming every time because you know it's like that
Put 'em out in piles like wax on the record because mothafuckers don't be doing their best to respect it
I put the fucking needle on the record


Needle on the record
See who gets dissected
Check the free flow when I wreck it
I redefine the new session
I hold it down
My flow will clown
Ain't no one around
Imma showing a frown
Imma  hold it these
These MCs ain't really fucking with the E-Y-E
It's so easy for me to grab your soul and snatch it
From your spine when you think you can rap, kid
I'm, aaa, the proper doctor of tactics
To watch the hypnotic way to smash this
And ask this, who's the classic?
Rap shit to bash it, I do it just for practice
And that's it, sticky like a cactus
Sticking to the motherfucking atlas, and that's it
So go back, my rap style's a classic
I kick some phat shit, I shatter you like a glass, bitch

My man, my man, my man
 is the atlas, then I play the roadmap
Y'all mother fuckers just play the really wack rap

They don't know how to flow phat
So I'm like hold back
I kiss your princess and turn the bitch into a ho, jack

You've got the dick so you please best to hold that
Understand we do this shit because you know it's so phat

When I grab the microphone I straight broke that
I don't got enough room for your whole click on my bozack

You seen us coming in the party and you said ""oh crap""
Because you are not even tight enough to cuss black


You've got no hands still trying to rock a soul clap
Do it with your elbows
Hell no, you can't float that",https://genius.com/Eyedea-eyedea-freestyling-in-tour-van-lyrics
