Int’l Players Anthem (I Choose You),Underground Kingz,2007.0,"So, I typed a text to a girl I used to see
Saying that I chose this cutie pie with whom I wanna be
And I apologize if this message gets you down
Then I CC'ed every girl that I'd see-see 'round town
And hate to see y'all frown but I'd rather see her smilin'
Wetness all around me, true, but I'm no island
Peninsula maybe,
 it makes no sense, I know crazy
Give up all this pussy cat that's in my lap, 
no looking back
Spaceships don't come equipped with rear view mirrors
They dip as quick as they can, the atmosphere is now ripped
I'm so like a pimp, I'm glad it's night
So the light from the sun would not burn me on my bum
When I shoot the moon,
 
high jump the broom
Like a preemie out the womb, my partner yelling, ""Too soon!
Don't do it! 
Reconsider, read some liter-
Ature on the subject? You sure? Fuck it
You know we got your back like chiroprac-tic
If that bitch do you dirty, we'll wipe her ass out in some detergent
Now hurry, hurry, go on to the altar
I know you ain't a pimp, but pimp, remember what I taught ya:
Keep your heart 
Three Stacks
, keep your heart
Hey, keep your heart Three Stacks, keep your heart
Man, these girls is smart, Three Stacks, these girls is smart
Play your part... play your part""

(Sweet Jones)
My bitch a choosy lover, never fuck without a rubber
Never in the sheets, like it on top of the cover
Money on the dresser, drive a Kompressor
Top notch hoes get the most, not the lesser
Trash like to fuck with forty dollars in the club
Fuckin' up the game, bitch, it gets no love
She be cross country, givin' all that she got
A thousand a pop, I'm pullin' Bentleys off the lot
I smashed up the gray one, bought me a red
Every time we hit the parkin' lot we turn heads
Some hoes wanna choose but them bitches too scary
Your bitch chose me, you ain't a pimp, you a fairy

Baby, you been rollin' solo, time to get down with the team
The grass is greener on that other side, if you know what I mean
I show you shit you never seen, the Seven Wonders of the World
And I can make you the eighth if you wanna be my girl
When I say my girl, I don't mean my woman, that ain't my style
Need a real street stalker (stalker) to walk a green mile
We piling up the paper on the dining room table
'Cause you able to realize I'm the truth and not a fable
We rocking Russian sable, keep that 'chilla on the rack
What I look like with some thousand dollar shit up on my back?
I'm a million dollar mack that need a billion dollar bitch
Put my pimpin' in your life, watch ya daddy get rich
Easy as A-B-C, simple as 1-2-3
Get down with U-G-K, Pimp C, B-U-N B
'Cause what's a ho with no pimp, and what's a pimp with no hoes?
Don't be a lame, you know the game and how it goes
We tryna get chose

Eeny meeny decisions, with precision I pick or
Make my selection on who I choose to be wit', girl
Don't touch my protection, I know you want it to slip
But slippin' is somethin' I don't do, tippin' for life
That's like makin' it rain every month on schedule
Let me tell you, get your parasol umbrella
'Cause it's gonna get wetter
Better prepare ya for the C support
She supposed to spend it on that baby, but we see she don't
""Ask-ask Paul McCartney, the lawyers couldn't stop it
Slaughter-slaughterin' of them pockets
Had to tie her to a rocket""
Send her in to outer space, I know he wish he could
'Cause he payin' 20K a day, that bitch is eating good
Like an infant on a double D titty, just getting plump
'Cause you miscalculated the next to the-the last pump
""Dump-dump in the gut, raw from the giddy up
Better choose that right one or pick-pick the kiddies up
(Shit)""",https://genius.com/Ugk-intl-players-anthem-i-choose-you-lyrics
One Day,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"Well, well, well, well
Hello baby
For one day you're here
And then you're gone
Well, well, well
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
I know
Lah dah dah dah dah
Yeah
Well, well
I know, I know, I know
Yeah

Mama put me out at only fourteen
So I start sellin' crack cocaine and codeine
Time to stack some paper, I gotta do it quick
Thinking I'm a juvenile but they don't know who they messin with, yeah
My mama's only son
But I live every day like it's my muthafuckin last one
Every nigga and they mama askin' why
But I'm in the game, live by the game, and in the game I'm a die
And if I die or should I say if I go
Bury me in Hiram Clarke next to the Come N Go
Cause tomorrow ain't promised to me
The only thing promised to a playa is the penitentiary
So I'm a take care of my business on the smooth tip
Watch my back sellin' crack and pack two clips
And when ya think about that you say ""It'll be on""
It's a trip you're here today but the next day you're gone

One day you're here, baby (Yeah)
And then you're gone (The next day you're gone)
One day you're here, baby (Wooooo)
And then you're gone (Baby, the next day you're gone)
One day you're here, baby (Noooo)
And then you're gone (The next day you're gone)
One day you're here, baby (Then you're gone)
And then you're gone

It's what we living in, man, it ain't nothing but drama
Everyone wanna harm ya
And New York niggas gettin shot for bombers
Now they got your life in the palm of
They hand like California
Niggas with dubs of hydroponic marijuana
Gangbangin' got the ghetto hotter than a sauna
Down in Orange my nigga Pots died on the corner
Behind a funky-ass dice game
I saw him once before he died wish it was twice, man
I remember being eight deep off in Chucky crib
Lettin' us act bad not giving a fuck what we did
When we lost him I knew the world was comin' sin
My brother been in the pen for damn near ten
But now it look like when he come out man I'm goin' in
So, shit, I walk around with my mind blown in my own fuckin' zone
'Cause one day you're here, the next day you're gone

One day you're here, baby
And then you're gone (The next day you're gone)
One day you're here, baby (Wooooo)
And then you're gone

I'm up early cause ain't enough light in the daytime
Smoke two sweets and 
sold three chickens 'fo the clock strike 9
Big nut holder, my boulders smolder on the PA pipes
AK loader as I get swallowed under city lights
Niggas be lookin shife, so I look shife back
Can't show no weakness with these bitches, get your life jacked
Man it's a trip where I stay, especially for me
Them bitches trying to lock me up for the whole century
They gave my nigga Donny 40, Dante 19
I wish that we could smoke again and take a tight lean
My world a trip you can ask Bun B, bitch, I ain't no liar
My man BoBo just lost his baby in a house fire
And when I got on my knees that night to pray, I asked God ""Why You let these killas live and take my homeboy's son away?""
Man if you got kids, show em you love em cause God just might call em home
Cause one day they're here and baby the next day they're gone

Oooohhhhhh
Gonnnnnnne
I know, you know
Well, well
Yeah
Aaahhhh

Pregnant Pussy,Banned,1992.0,"Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Preg-pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
I got your fat pregnant bitch in my waterbed
And I'm 'bout to bust a nut on your little baby's head

I guess you can call me a family man
Cause I care for bitches' babies every chance that I can
I don't give 'em clothes, or diapers and shit
But I like to feed they babies with my big black dick
Cause I'ma tell you if you didn't know
You ain't did shit 'til you fucked a pregnant ho
The pussy is hotter, it's got a extra kick
It feel like hot potato pie around your dick
Sometimes I swing high, sometimes I swing low
Sometimes I like to fuck a pregnant bitch on my floor
Hit it kinda hard, and speed it up fast
Fuck her 'til she get the cherry blisters on her ass
Cause if she expecting, I can satisfy
And at the same time, give her kid a pacifier
And I love it when I bust that old nut
Cause I know that her baby's just gon' lick it all up

Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Preg-pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
I got your fat pregnant bitch in my waterbed
And I'm 'bout to bust a nut on your little baby's head

Ain't no pussy like one impregnated
A pussy made for nutting in, I could never hate it
A swoll pussy hole is the best on earth
And a big dick helps make an easy childbirth
I love the big titties but I hate the taste of milk
And a bigger, fatter ass on my dick is smooth as silk
Now if she got a boy, it ain't fun
But if she got a girl, then it's two pussies for the price of one
And if the belly's all stacked
I'll put the ho on all four and hit the pussy from the back
I'm fucking all over the womb
Now I move your baby to the side so I can get a little room
I love to fuck them pregnant hoes
Your baby's sneezing out nuts because I bust one in his nose
So when your little child is born
I bet the motherfucker tell you pregnant pussy got it going on

Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Preg-pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
I got your fat pregnant bitch in my waterbed
And I'm 'bout to bust a nut on your little baby's head

You see, fuckin' pregnant pussy is simple
All you gotta do is hope the baby think your dickhead is a nipple
And if the cum snatcha stimulate my sack
He just might get a fat load of Similac
And if he start kicking, I'ma keep sticking
Go a little deeper, give his bad ass a whipping
Within nine months, I can hit it late or sooner
It's me, Miss Jones, and Mr. Jones Junior
And once I get the bitch in the raw
Me and her kid can have a nice ménage à trois
So believe I ain't kicking no bullshit
Cause pregnant pussy is the best you can get

Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Pregnant pussy is the best you can get
Fucking a bitch while her baby sucking dick
Preg-pregnant pussy is the best you can get

Diamonds & Wood,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"Yeah, 
coming down
Dedicated to them boys riding slab

I fli-, I flips down the Ave
Know I'm looking good
I'm banging ""Screw"", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I flip down the Ave., you know I'm looking tight
These jealous niggas looking at me and my car so shife
Wanna take my life, and wanna jack, but I see all through that
Never let these bitch niggas take what's mine, nigga, never do that
Who say he going through a thang, when y'all ain't never lied
I gotta baby, but his mama act like he ain't mine
Wicked women using children to live on
Wanna hurt and try to hate 'cause she know the thrill is gone
Say, man, 
I stopped smoking wit' haters back in ninety-four
But niggas thinking that a Sweet gonna get him through my door
And niggas talk alotta shit in a safe place
I know 'cause he can't look me eye-to-eye when he in my face
Now, nigga, listen to my beats, and see just what I mean
Nigga, I ride dirty every day, but still I shine so clean
Glitter and gleam, ain't all what it look like
So I keep swanging out here clanging tryna live my life

I fli-, I flips down the Ave
Know I'm looking good
I'm banging ""Screw"", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I see these niggas and days, go and come
And for me, just to wake, I know I'm blessed
I grab my 'ses and split my Swisher wit' my thumb
Some of my Sweets be tight, now some of my Sweets be fucked up!
But all o' my Sweets gon' blow, so killa' smoke get sucked up!
I lucked up today, and didn't fall prey to none of that pistol play
But who is to say, tomorrow they won't be blasting this-a-way
I'm puffin' spliff's of hay, still upset about the drama here
At this time of year, I'm wiping away my dead homies mama tears (Shit)
But naturally, them fucking laws was always after me
So I have to be in that manor on that five-oh-three
I'm living dastardly, must be all about survival 'g
These niggas passing me, streets just keep on getting live wit' me
They said there has to be another way, but I ain't feeling that
They tried to steal a 'Lac, and my wig, they wanna peel it back
But still the fact remains, it's all about the 'cain
""Swang and Bang"", peace to ESG and all the victims of the game, mang

I fli-, I flips down the Ave
Know I'm looking good
I'm banging ""Screw"", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood

I'm flippin' through P.A., I'm trynna see some good
But everythang is still the same, in my neighborhood
Niggas frown when you up, and smile when you down
And when you change for the better, shife fools stop coming around
I see the jealousy and hating and the wicked ways
We all lost children, praisin' paper, smoking our life away
Got to the point where I could not decipher day from night
She say she love me, but all we do now is fuck and fight
My conscience fuck wit' me so much that I can't eat or sleep
The other side of selling dope, and out there running the streets
And even though I'm gaining street fame, coming from this rap game
Lustful thinking and compulsive drinking is a normal thang
Some get erased and misplaced, trying to win the race
Some try to hold on to they place, by smoking wet lace
But see drugs and plastic thugs ain't gon' change the hood
I'm smoking skunk and popping the trunk to make me feel good

I fli-, I flips down the Ave
Know I'm looking good
I'm banging ""Screw"", nigga
Diamonds up against that wood",https://genius.com/Ugk-diamonds-and-wood-lyrics
Murder,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"I'm still Pimp C, bitch—so what the fuck is up?
Puttin' powder on the streets cuz I got big fuckin' nuts
Comin' back from Louisiana in a Fleetwood Lac
I just served them niggas some shit to put they fiends on they back
Got the pounds going for 4 cause you know I just pay 2
Nigga bought thirty from me So I front him 42
He gon' pop for 700 times 62
24/8 is what I do so nigga fuck what 'cha do
If I told ya cocaine numbers, you would think I was lyin'
Young niggas 22 is talkin' bout they retirin'
In the game ain't a thang comin' foreign with Benz
Brick home and two apartments where I entertain friends
Mo bounce to the ounce cuz the Brougham the shit
I done got me 50 ounces out of birds in this bitch
Tightin' up, no slack, bitches checkin' my stock
Got some birds I sell to niggas, some I go rock for rock
Just got back from California kicked it with B-Legit
Put me down with purple chronic and that hurricane shit
At the studio with Tone
, I wish I could stay
I got to holla at Master P, cuz we got money to make
And when playaz from the South stack G'z man
Like Ball I got to stack big cheeze, man
Bitch say he wanna show you got nine grand?
I ain't rappin' shit until my money in my hand
South Texas mutherfucka that's where I stay
Gettin' money from yo bitches every goddamn day
Big paper I'm foldin'
Hoes is on my mutherfuckin' jock for all this dick that I be holdin'
I hate clone men show it
Especially them fools that take our style and act like my niggas don't know it
Kick it with the trill niggas so you best not trip

You need a swift kick in', yo ass is ripe for the pickin'
Now as my pockets thicken
I be kickin' nickel slickin' you sick when I be clickin'
Now take a look at the bigger nigga, Malt liquor swigger
Playa hata ditch digger
Figure my hair trigger give a hot one in yo liver
You shiver, shake, and quiver
I'm frivolous if a nigga get wetter than a river
For what it's worth it's the birth of some niggas doin' dirt
Fuck her first night, take off the skirt, make her pussy hurt
It's the Master
Hit the Swisha faster then you fever blister bastard
Fuck yo sister passed her, fifty 
elbows
 for sale yo
Brother better have my mail, ho
Fore I catch a murder case and go to jail
Oh, hell no! Time to bail hit the trail so
We can sell mo fuckin' yayo get the scale
No other bullet duckers can shove us out of this game
So they better buck us, 'cause the cluckers they love us
Make them glass dick suckers shake their jelly like Smucker's
I hit like nun-chuckers, 
cause Short Texas bring the ruckus
This for my muhfuckers, cookin' cheese to crooked G'z
Rockin' up quarter keys just to get the hook with ease
Wannabes get on yo knees
Feel the squeeze from them HK 1-3s
From here to overseas, we do what we please
Don't trip 'cause we flip, light up a dip
I'm breakin' 'em off from they hip to yo lip
Go ask that boy Skip, that nigga Bun rip
With one clip, soon as the gun slip
Now I done whipped out my Barrelli
Flyin' through yo Pelle Pelle and
Some smelly red jelly is drippin' out of ya belly
Served 'em like a Deli jumped on my cellular telli
Ho sell it like it's goin' out of style
You can't see me, Marcus,

Pocket Full of Stones,Too Hard to Swallow,1992.0,"I gotta pocket full of stones (Hey mothafucka) 7x

When I first started back in 1989
I wasn't moving keys I was barely moving dimes
Started coming up fiends recognize my face
I was paying off the laws so I wouldn't catch a case
You want to freebase I got them hubbas for your ass
A boulder on your pipe and you can have a megablast
Cash went to stacks, then it went to piles
Thanks to the dope fiends hitting crack vials

Back in the days they used to run up saying Pimp C what ya know?
I tell em get this crack and get the fuck away from me hoe!
Cause everywhere I went it became an instant cut
Cause they knew I cut them twentys and them big fat monkey nuts
A fiend gon' be a fiend, you can't change they ass I guess
So them mothafuckas tweak until they take a Brilo pad in they chest
Now they won't leave me alone
Cause they know I got a whole pocket full of stones

I gotta pocket full of stones (7x)
And they won't leave my ass alone

I bought a Cadillac dropped it to the street top
Got me a family and started pushin crack rock
Rock crack sho paid good in the city set'
Had a fucking ho for every letter in the alphabet
Annie and Brenda, Carla and Dee
And a whole lot a fiends that used to suck my dick for free
(Bun B) Then what you did C?
I bought my first key from my babymommabrutha
I cooked the shit myself and started passin out them hubbas
Everybody in my faaamly was clockin loot
Sold my cadillac and got a brand new lexus sports coupe
I gotta house on the hill gotta boat on the lake
Got a detail shop to cover up them duckets that I make
It's to the point where I don't see dope no more
Still smoke weed still drink beer and toke
Now the laws won't leave me alone
Cause they know all my niggas got a pocket full of stones


Living real smooth like Aloe Vera lotion
I'm selling crack rock, the devil's love potion
Three wheel motion on my buick park ave
Fiends used to smoke twenties, now they smokin slabs
Paid like a muthafucka clientele is growin
Geakin' so bad I got pregnant fiends hoin
Suck a dick and lick an ass just to get a bump
Fuck Black Caesar niggas call me Black Trump
Pistol Grip pump in my lap at all times
Niggas fuck wit other niggas shit but they don't fuck wit mine
Got my money totalled for a big time pass
17-5 I gotta bird on they ass
I put my boys down so they wouldn't have to rob
Now my click is coming up like the fuckin mob
My workers got workers everybody making green
Gettin cash for putting stones in the pockets of the fiends


Keys are moving daily, the product selling fast
Me and my nigga C is makin money out the ass
This shit is gettin silly dope is so easy to sell
Pay everybody bail ain't no spendin time in jail
I gotta make the sales cause it's all about that green
Mo worker mo workers, my face ain't on the scene
My attitude is mean cause I keepin my respect
Ain't nobody out of line cause I got em all in check
I broke a cops neck cause he step outta place
Dead pig, murder 1 now I got time to face
The judge that sent me got capped by my nigga C
And now his ass is sent up the river next to me
Four years pass and we back on the shoulder
Hit the cut with fifty, bought a nice fat boulder
Cut it to a nice fat pile of hubba tens
Got a pocket full of stones starting all over again",https://genius.com/Ugk-pocket-full-of-stones-lyrics
Hi-Life,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"Dog, it's real up in here
Niggas will kill you if you fuck up
You know what I'm saying
They shoot all kinds of game
I'm just thankful the lord blessed me that I can see it a hundred miles away
You know

Hi Life
We living that hi life
Hi Life (Hi Life... mmmmmmmmmm)
We living that hi life... mmmmmmmmmmm

I'm tired of living fucked up, tired of living bad
Tired of hearing grandmama telling me
When you gonna go to church Chad
Now I'm trying to live up to the image
That she would want to see
But I got one foot in the street
And every week I flip a Ki
I never wanted to be a G
But niggas depend on me
It ain't safe to hit I-10
So niggas fear wit me
And all the niggas that I went to school wit
Got cool wit, went to fool wit
Out there sellin' that white shit
Pushing cocaine, niggas' whole existence
Dependent on the game
What ya want me to do, it's like somebody cut my throat
Got $20,000, trying to turn it to a hundred
And ain't nobody got no dough
So niggas tend to smoke, bad habits do exist
And this bitch think that she can ease my mind
By sucking my dick
Bitch maybe for a minute but that shit never lasts
It's 1996 niggas is dying from laying on some ass
First Magic Johnson got it, then Eazy-E died
And you be wonderin' why young niggas out there smokin' fry
I wish that I could tell y'all I wore a rubber everytime
But if I told you that, nigga, you know that I be lying
And I've been fucking pussy since the tender age of nine
It's getting to be a full-time job just trying to stay alive
And Crackers tend to smirk, offended by the weed smoke coming off my shirt
But still I put in work and front for my folks
Cause where I come from, nigga, family just ain't no joke
Now D be getting married, and Edgar on the boat
But what about Baby Doe, some say that nigga's selling dope
And you know I ain't lying, that's just how family talk
But what you gonna do when the Devil poke you with his fork
And everybody sitting in the pulpit ain't saved
Most preachers are false prophets
Fucking hoes and getting paid
I'm looking for the

Hi Life
We living that hi life
Hi Life (Hi Life... mmmmmmmmmm)
We living that hi life... mmmmmmmmmmm

You only got one life to live
That's all they give us to do it
You can bullshit your way through it
Or stay true, it can be complicated 'cause niggas
Be getting shot in the cross
People and names get lost
The feeble and lame get tossed
Streets'll eat your ass alive
Take your possessions with pistols, bare hands, and knives
And nobody's surprised if somebody
Don't survive the dusk to see dawn
It's treacherous how we was left here to just die
On the streets that we be on
Motherfuckers sleeping on them corners that you pee on
Probably cause society felt they didn't belong
Now who in the fuck made it this way for us
Got all these little niggas selling that yay
Because it ain't like they make higher levels gainable
And that quote piece of American pie just ain't attainable
So how can I sustain a full life before death
Man, I'm left out here to make it by my goddamn self
Now c'mon, who gives a damn when you can't afford the turkey or ham
Living off of Raemon Noodles, beef jerky, and Spam
Now that's sad, but that's a fact of life
All I can see in front of me is up for grabs
Come off your slab
'Cause poverty will push a nigga over the brink
Over the edge especially if you don't know your ledge
And so instead of being without, I'm hustling
Trying to get through these ungodly days
Thinking of ways to get the fuck outta this maze
A man'll commit a crime 'cause a fucking crime pays
I'm going through a phase you don't grow out
Until you a reason a mother fucker gots to po' out
His 40 on the curb, disturbed and left with no doubt in his mind
But still sometimes he don't know why
He walking around just hoping
He get one more try to make it
It's bullshit he going through, but yo, he gots to take it
You can't fake it, to get the hi life

Gravy,Underground Kingz,2007.0,"Uhhhhhhhh!
If you know like I know you would get down on the floor
I keep a magnum for they back and I keep a swisher full of dro
We can get down for my dime and we can fuck on the low
And if you didn't want a Pimp then what'cha fucking with me for?
Every lady ain't a ho and every ho ain't my bitch
It take a real trill nigga to recognize this type of shit
Every girl around me legit, I don't fuck around with no punks
Ride with me she holding a pistol while I'm whipping and popping the trunk
We gon' blow a lot of skunk and we gon' make a lot of bread
And we ain't never gon' have no problems long as she hear what the fuck I said
Pimping ain't dead it just moved to the website
Still like to get my dick sucked under the street lights
I'm Tony Snow, I'm out here living by the code
In love with a lifestyle, not no bitch I'm in that mode
I'm looking at you, you choosing me my dickhead never stop
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm shooting for stars, we headed to the top

I'm staying true, I'm out here whipping my Mercedes
Fucking with the midnight ladies the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm banging Screw, my young girl looking fine
We staying out here on the grind and keeping money on our mi-ii-iind

Well I'm certified official, authentic and the real McCoy
Guaranteed to blow the spot when I'm in it, got to feel ya boy
100%, real Bun B I represent
Trill with that gangster ass persona so hard that it can dent
Still
in the hood cause it needs me, and the corner it feeds me
So I eat all I want, my reputation proceeds me
If you grimy or greasy, then your best step be easy
Cause that forty-feezy, leave you leaking fo' sheezy
Trigger fingers I squeeze see, and the cannons is bust
Them bullets blow by you breezy, like a midsummer gust
It'll put your dick in the dust, when I put one up in your dome
You be leaking out plasma and puss, and your mouth'll fill up with foam
So you got to go hard or go home, either be a boy or a man
Got to pay the cost to be the boss or you take a loss understand?
Got to play the hand that you're dealt, that's until it's your turn to deal
Otherwise you get it how you live, I could give a fuck how you feel

I'm staying true, I'm out here whipping my Mercedes
Fucking with the midnight ladies the game is cold but it's gravy
I'm banging Screw, my young girl looking fine
We staying out here on the grind and keeping money on our mi-ii-iind

I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm from the South
This scary ho don't wanna know what this about
Cause I stay country true down to the core
Dick good like uncut blow
In your nose, in your jaws
Feel it tighten up don't stop, don't pause
Candy nigga drive candy cars
Fuck the D.A. fuck the law
I fuck the snow
But I love a pro
Like flat backers
I'm a Cadillac'er
On parole well I'm a pistol packer
Drugs sold, powder jacker
Get with me if she a money stacker
Bitch around me man I'm a mack her

From the land of cheap work and steady licks
With pounds of dro and them powder bricks
We grind to eat, and eat to live
This shit for real, these ain't no tricks
With 36 hoes to the ki, and 10 kilograms in the sack
And 15 sacks up in the trunk now that's 1.5 mill' worth of crack
It's Big Dick Cheney, Tony Snow, the King Committee is now in session
Today's agenda, get that dough cause the clock is ticking, time is pressing
No second guessing, make your mind up, step your grind up and get that pay
Gotta sell your ass or a nigga blast if you wanna roll with that UGK

I'm staying true, I'm out here whipping my Mercedes
Fucking with the midnight ladies the game is cold but it's gravy

Touched,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"Dog, I was just lookin'—man, lookin' 'round, I see two niggas kissin', man. Shit out of sight. Motherfuckers tongue-kissin'. Hahaha

Listen up, I got a story to tell
Aye, fool, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, dog, listen up, I got a story to tell
Say, man, listen up, I got this story to tell
On the cool;

Now, once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
Now, this was not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no goddamn sense, try'na push me
He used to hold dick, now he wanna be in my shoes
Hatin' like a baby mama 'cause I'm payin' my dues
Tryin' to hold on to my little chunk but not a punk in the parking lot bumping his gums
With his Ki's in the trunk, oh what I'm supposed to jump 'cause you got a pump
You aimin' that bitch in the sky, you chump
Point that motherfucker this way and dump
Oh, what, you scared to go to the pen?
Thinkin' them niggas gon tap your rump?
Man, I thought he played bold but he ain't even fuss
Man, the nigga was way swole actin' like he wanted to buss
But his trigger stayed cold I wasn't surprised
I recognized that fast breathin' and fear in his eyes
Unmask his disguise a sheep in wolf's clothing
On the prey, who tried to hunt the hunter
And got hunted down his goddamn self in PA
Niggas it's where we stay
Ain't none of that K-K-K'n or playin' so see A
Or E about your life 'fore you test yourself
And make a nigga break you off some peace to rest yourself
Oh, yes, your health is what's in question
And I hope that this ass whippin'
Teach you a motherfuckin' lesson

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
'Cause deep down in the South boy's comin up cold
Talkin' down on my name and what it's all about
You niggas better be gettin some cut and get my name out yo mouth
'Cause I dunno why you got plex with me
Testin' me but I'mma pull my shit and let you see
That all that carry the jack ain't able to survive
So you haters need to quit with that po' hustlin'
And take another ride
[Verse 2: Bun B + 
Pimp C
]
Niggas jumped and crossed the line
The movies got these boys fucked up in the mind
Not to mention the wine and codeine syrup combined
Easy access to 9s
And shit talkin hoes, that's fine
And all they got time for is pourin' Swishers down
Committing crimes amped off water
And some exaggerated rhyme
So if bein' hard ain't in your heart
Then don't start niggas'll tear your weak mind apart
Bitch, your old man talkin' to me like I'm in school
He don't know I hang with killers we'll erase that fool
Wouldn't give a fuck about him but he kin to my son
If you think that I'm that nigga then you picked the wrong one
Cause I live by the gun die by the gun
Hot bullets burn some say that them bitches stun
So raise your own children don't try to raise mine
And when you see me step with caution cause I'm buckin' for mine, bitch

Speak the wrong words man and you will get touched
You done crossed the line now you gon get fucked
I already told you before but you ain't barring that
So this time I'm handlin' mine and gon erase you off the map
Such a shame but it's all in the game
And since the early 60's ain't a damn thing changed
We got haters over here and haters over there
But I got my pistol and it ain't pointed in the air

I see you trippin' off that water and you feel like you bad
Cause yo bitch done chose a pimp and that pimp was Chad
I see you hurt cause I fucked your girl
Put big dick in her world, bust nuts in her curls
When I hit it from the back she said ""baby I can't take it""
Push my dick up in her harder bitch I'm straight up tryin to break it
You a simp-ass nigga you told that bitch that you love her
But I'm straight up fuckin' that pussy like that nigga off 
that colors
But I ain't gonna get shot cause you ain't shootin' shit
The best thing you can do is go and try and beat that bitch
Cause this man's style showstopper pistol popper you ain't ready
If I let this hot thing hit you fool, your stomach like spaghetti
Fool you talkin' loud but you move too slow
Tellin' niggas all your plans got you tied up in a van
Nigga what the fuck is up (up) in the place to be
First I want the money nigga then I want the fuckin' Ki's
Kidnap robbery cause you said you wanted me dead
Since you want a nigga dead
Buck that bitch off in his head
Just like E-40 nigga I be comin' fed
Got the sawed off pump with night vision infrared
So play me like a pussy and you will get fucked
Nigga I'm hangin' out the truck b-buck buck
Hit your nigga in the leg hit your bitch in the gut
But we know where your ass stay
So your ass will get touched

Speak the wrong words I'm high on them herbs
And you will get touched cause yo ass deserve
To get done real bad in front of yo kids
To show 'em what real type of bitch you is
And it's that boy named 3 to the 2 forever stayin' true
Just a player makin' do and I gotta tell it to the
Whole wide world how you got bitched razor necked just like
A motherfuckin' girl",https://genius.com/Ugk-touched-lyrics
Wood Wheel,Dirty Money,2001.0,"Smoke somethin', bitch...smoke somethin'...

I'm up early cause my nigga
Don't sell dope after night time
Love choppin' blades, rollin' hooptie
'N move the dope through the pipeline
Pimp C, bitch...holla at yo' bitch
Now yo' bitch on my team;
Got her buyin' us sticky green
Lace some with promythazine
Candy sweets, a candy bitch
You lookin' at a candy boy
I done came down Main and popped trunk;
Hit the switch on my candy toy
We all young ghetto boys
That's why we act this way
Tryin' to see a million dollars
Hopin' these niggas don't blast today

Pro smoke, pro choke
Anti-broke, conservative liberal
Left-wing slangin', right-wing hangin'
In criminal court, it's civil
In the middle of reality
Unsolved mysteries riddle
Knockin' over fat cats
And gettin' my dogs some bits and kibbles
On note pads I scribble
Write rippers that'll make you think
Snap so hard it'll break your synch and splits ronicity
Fuck it, take a drink
I fake it, blink 'n poof
We disappearin' into a shroud of dojer
Cloud composures, 
all-nighters like Folger's
But, bitch, I tried to told ya

Rollin' Seville
Grippin' my steel
Might pop a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Sedan DeVille
House on the hill
Countin' up my scrill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Nigga, how you feel
I feel so trill
Might pop me a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
House on the hill
Marijuana fields
Grippin' my steel
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel

They tellin' me, ""Bun don't go there""
But, man, I just gots to bring it
These niggas, they wanna hate on that Texas
But scared to sing it
They don't know what that star 'bout
They don't know what that barre 'bout
They don't know what that candy car 'bout
Or smokin' that jar 'bout
All they know is what the fuck I tell 'em
Or what the fuck we sell 'em
Smokin' Swishers, wood grain
And leavin' stains on cerebellums
Rebellum, propell 'em, gel 'em
From P.A. to Deep Ellum
Tell 'em I tol' 'em
Wrote 'em, fuck it, phone 'em
To hell to heaven

I just spent 60 G's
On a brand new Eldo-reeze:
Black-on-black, drop top 'lac;
Northstar
 
fifth wheel on back
Sometimes I feel like Lil' Ke
When my trunk steady hummin'
Had to leave my bitch
Cause I fell in love with my chrome-plated woman
I love my wood wheel Grant
'84 Cadillacs that slant
Slowed-down Screw tapes that knock
Blowin' on Green private stock
Bitch, I don't eat hamhock
Try 20-ounce Angus beef
Hangin' with young niggas, that pack big triggas
'N got big-ass diamonds off in they teeth

Fifth wheel and grill
Candy Seville
Might pop a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
House on the hill
Still flexin' mils
Countin' up my scrills
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Comin' down so trill
Nigga, how you feel?
Might pop a pill
Bitch, I'm workin' wood wheel
Grippin' the steal
Nigga, I'm so real
Bitch, how you feel?
Nigga, I'm workin' wood wheel

Smokin' on bionic, bubonic, chronic, it's so ironic
Sippin' gin and tonic: supersonic like Johnny Mneumonic
We crash your party, piss on your parade
Sip syrup like it's Lemonade
From Paris to the Palacades to the Prominade
Bomb and fade, closes the car, break worlds, it's plain as day
That's the game we came to play
It don't change, ain't a thang to say

It's goin' down in the H-Town
Young playa from the South 'bout to blaze a pound
Tryin' to find me a bopp with some good mouth
I know you freaky bitches know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Ain't got no time to play, girl
Let me get a little throat and some good skull'

Off in the street, lookin' for the good stuff?
Bitch, I don't give a fuck about yo' man, so
Bitch tryin' to fuck fast, I'mma fuck slow

Couldn't not recite us, come to our show
And bitch niggas try to fight us
Ho niggas scream and talk, trill niggas bust and leave
How the fuck you're gonna go to war
When you bitch-ass niggas ain't got no cheese?

It's going down, leaning, drink your drink
Candy sweets, nahmsayin' third coast, nigga, UGK 'bout to wreck shop
This C-Note off that Botany
Smokin' and leanin', nigga
Stacking paper, fool
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

Man, I'm larger than life
These motherfuckers ask, is it the bark or the bite?
It's both, chilling on streets you scared to park on at night
Just forfeit, just like I'm becoming part of the light
And you, man, you going to be the biggest mark at the fight
See, I never understood what made you think you was handling
You half-ass running through my neighborhood vandling
Next time, I'm a light your world up like a cannon
Get some Italians to play your ass like a mandolin
These cocaine wars got my mind in a frenzy
The feds tried to confiscate my 'Lac and my Benzy
Colombian assassins hunt a nigga like Lindsey
And one of my workers came up short with my ends, see
Shit, running the streets used to be complicated
But now it’s all either drug- or strong-arm-related
But never can a bomb be faded, fool
Ring the alarm, pour the Dom

I'm coming down real shiny like candy paint
'Bout three in the morning, yawning
I wish I could come down, but you know I can't
Cause I'm leaning off the dank and the good ol' drink
I got five on the weed, fifty on the drink
Fool, I'm coming down, fuck what these hoes think
I wish I could come down, but you know I can't
Cause I'm leaning off the dank and the good ol' drink

Three in the morning, just turned over
Pimped into my clothes
Got to get around, some hustlers moving in the Chevy Nova
Done flagged me down for some more of that brown
To go with that green, now they sitting on lean
Now the light is green, got to get the snaps
So I bails from the scene, the watch was still packed
With dealers and fiends freaking for Gs and greens
See, it's the same every night
Niggas creeping down G way and keeping they head tight
Watching for laws because you know they wanna hate
Jealous cause a nigga getting ahead of this paper chase
Can't place my faith in these streets
But some niggas gotta hustle just to eat
Niggas jacking and packing, they playing for keeps
No peace of mind, keeping my heat behind
My seat 'cause I do not want to be caught sleeping
By another fool out creeping
While I'm chilling getting sweeted

I'm coming down real shiny like candy paint
'Bout three in the morning, yawning
I wish I could come down, but you know I can't
Cause I'm leaning off the dank and the good ol' drink
I got five on the weed, fifty on the drink
Fool, I'm coming down, fuck what these hoes think
I wish I could come down, but you know I can't
Cause I'm leaning off the dank and the good ol' drink

What you see is what the fuck you get
Young Pimp C, baby, coming down real wet
I got a pump in the 'Lac cause these niggas tried to jack us
But we don't give a fuck, I got the AK in the back of us
Came out the night club, three o'clock struck
Trying to holler at my people, she in Lexus, I'm in truck
We 'bout to eat breakfast, we in Houston, Texas
The city of the crack, and the 'Lacs, and the plexers
I'm hollering at Botany, Courtney came with the love
We coming down, mane, blowing smoke in his lungs
'Cause I'mma candy sweet dipper, a big 'caine pimper
I'm playing with the clit-ah, I'm squeezing on the nipples
Even though this ho look good and the pussy is tight
After I hit, jump in my shit, I'm scratching off in the night
Fuck that laying in the bed with the ho 'til the morning
Bitch, I'm getting out here yawning, coming back to reforming
Three in the morning
Three in the morning

I'm coming down real shiny like candy paint
'Bout three in the morning, yawning
I wish I could come down, but you know I can't
Cause I'm leaning off the dank and the good ol' drink

Grippin' on the grain, drippin' stains in the hood
Leather and the wood, pretty lady and the chrome
Comin' down on the fo's, gettin' my shine on
So when you see me leanin' on the buck with the stitch
Hide yo' ho', cuz I probably finna fuck with your bitch
So when I'm in corner
With my playa-ass persona
Put my pimpin' game up on her
Guarantee that she's a gonner
Easy for you to get her but it's harder to keep
When that real pimpin' hit your boulevard on the creep
Now nigga you can beat, put dope in they lungs
But it don't even matter
I finna scatta' with ya hoes
Don't hate the playa, hate the game

Red bone, pretty thong
She done got me feelin' on
I'm really strong, clear as stones
Man, a nigga really on
I got a bad yellow bitch
When she bust it back it's pink
Her pussy hair softer than the feathers on my mink
Fresh outta school, ball up in this
Young, and super fine
Told her how to rub my nuts when I fuck her from behind
I ain't lying, she a dime
And she be 'round all them bad hoes
She love when I rub my hands 'cross her ass ho'
Pretty brown, pretty face, pretty toes
She a stallion and she stay on all fours

No matter where I go and no matter who I meet
Everybody tryna tell me how they feel 'bout the South
On the cool, them haters need to shut they fuckin mouth
Cause we grip grain, nigga we pop trunk
We to' straps and we ready for the funk
Some niggas two-step, some niggas dance
Some niggas just ball wit' a bottle in they hands
Sell a couple ringtones niggas, that's bread

Made a deal with the state to turn your foul partner in
But he took 15, befo' you could tell
He ain't witchu no mo' ho, you got twenty in a cell

Ain't no appeal, but they dropped it to five?
Who you had to fuck to give back that time?

Three big brothers, fo'—wanna squab with me
So I guess a brother gotta throw
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up out my camp dude
Befo' I have to pull my gat and get, real rude
I don't figure that it's worth gettin hurt
Just cause ya gal wanna give me that skirt
Bet it feels funny when ya doin 69
Knowin that ya sippin on all my jimmy wine
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bad
Knowin that ya swallowed all the skeeter that I had?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda shot you up instead I told ya somethin good

""Tell me something good  (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)""
""Tell me something good (Oh yeaaaaah...yeah)""
""Tell—""
""Tell me something good (Ohhhhhhh-hoo!, tell me, tell me...)""
""Tell me something good (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)""

Aiyyo, what's up with that bulge in ya khakis?
You wanna pack a gat, but you STILL ain't got the pull to come and jack me
You betta bring a gangload of homies when you think you wanna throw
Cause by yourself, you'll run into the flo'
I seen your kind befo', man ya nothin with your hands
More than a punk but still less than a man
You talk a lot of nothin when ya chillin with the ladies
Let me catch ya by yourself, you're pushin up some daisies
See crazy you wanna be, but punks with no heart, they ain't hard
They just waitin for Bun to pull they card
You betta keep your weak self locked in ya hood
Cause without your boys I'mma have to tell ya somethin good

Brothers nowadays got a habit that they really need to stop
Gettin all shot over a girl that I done popped
You need to check ya girl and what she did in the past
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her REAL fast
But I don't trust the dugout, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the skinz like government cheese
But not me player, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had your test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fight with me
You need to check ya blood and let somebody check your skeet
But if you don't step, I'mma drop on ya fast
And pump off bullets like government cash
I didn't do ya girl but your sister was alright
Took her to my homeboy's Caddy last night   (*girl moaning in the background*)
She waxed my jimmy, and then the little street tramp
Did me on a box of tens and a Pioneer amp
I hit it from the back, and the girl just threw me
Told me, ""Pump it harder,"" and she scratched me on my booty
Now everybody in the world
Know that your sister is a nasty lil' girl

""Tell me something good  (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)""
""Tell me something good (Oh yeaaaaah...yeah)""

Let's talk about these half-n-half punks
By day they sorry bastards, at night they talkin bout, poppin trunks
But a .25 cain't keep you alive
From a sawed-off, fool so I hope you survive
See bluffin might save ya tail one day
But who's ta say, it won't catch ya next week, on the runway?
You might shoot a few shots in the wind
But the same time tomorrow, you'll be runnin again
Now can you keep it up, every damn night?
You steady runnin to the argument but runnin from the fight
What's the deal man? Why don't you take your Raiders cap off?
Cause one of these days, you gonna getcha head slapped off
You cain't keep a crew cause they gettin sick of seein you bail
Like a punk'll hit the backstreet trail
And the women don't like you cause ya act like them
And that's why your little jimmy never went fo' a swim
Ya talk about slangin, makin G's
But I saw a fiend chase ya from, BJ's up to Mickey D's
Now everyday punks get took
Either for they dough, they'll ride 'em for the powder that they cook
You bookin from the scene cause ya couldn't hold ya own
A 40 ounce bottle slams, ya dead to your dome
Now you want revenge, so ya get your automatic
Find a group of hard-heads, and startin kickin static
Ya pulled ya little chrome but these fools got gats
Try to run and caught two buckshots in ya back
Now you nothin but a memory that's gone in a slayin
So when I tell you somethin good, punk I don't be playin",https://genius.com/Ugk-something-good-extended-version-lyrics

And I'm a red hot undercover pimmmmmp (pimmmmp)
That make them guls get down on the flo', on the flo'
Like a real live money makin pro, uhh

You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

Unh..
It was a Secret that Victoria tried to hide
A little sly delight, I done pushed my pride aside
Just to slide inside, man I done died tonight
Now what I'm 'sposed to do? Been got close to you
Lookin like a poster to, don't wanna boast but you Missus
Do a Dr. Feelgood, lay a playa real good
Limpin came back, and it was still good, she will
Put a few tips in her mouth, that's that definition
Of them true chicks in the South, let me do my thang
On the cool quick to the cock, get the beds but guess what?
We kickin them out, shakin it soft, shoulda been here
She did eight in the loft, but you was late and you lost
Man she was takin it off

Take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

I'm steady touchin' with my diamonds on, and man I
Miss that boy Pac, sippin' liquor
 tryin' to grip the chrome
I keep a chip off in my cell phone, they used to call me Pimp C
But now the chicks they call me James Jones
And if I skip I'm back to D-slangin, keep them boys nod-headed
Keep the boppers with they butts swangin
I used to be the young playa holdin
Now I leave them guls with they jellyroll swollen, I'm rollin

You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick

Comin direct from the Gentlemen's, full of the Phenergan
Live on stage fellas, this is Cinnamon
Fine, Black and feminine, I'm fin to win, look at the sin I'm in
Full of hallucinogens, me her and her friends
Now the venom in my snake, wanna poison
Come in with a brother and the boys and
Make sure you don't forget to bring the toys and
We stuck it check it, we gots to keep em gettin bucked naked
Makin it soft, we keep these boppers takin it off

Take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off some, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH
And let a first class nigga break you off, chick
You gotta take it off, take it off, UNH

Cause they was bitin' too much Pac
But what goes up, must come down
While these bitches suckin' dick
And droppin' to the ground
Every city, every town
I'm ballin' in the mix
I'm servin' niggas bricks
Keep a bad yellow bitch
On my team, sippin' lean
Ain't a thang of the past
The '84 Beritz with the slant-back ass
Keepin' me a pro, next to my folk
Instead of stackin' cheese
He steady screamin' to that ho

Dress above they knees, jellies and G-strings up the ass
Man I never let 'em pass
So tell me where can I find 'em
With they nigga or in that candy Cadillac right behind him

Bitches tellin me ""C yo' dick grand.""
All she wanna do is ride Su-bur-ban
Put her ass on the leather, and rub the wood
See we got boppers in Texas oh man that pussy look good
So I let them hoes ride and I show them a grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
When she told me I looked good I didn't feel no pride

Your homeboys lookin for ya, but yo' ass gone
You left your niggas at the club and took ALL them hoes home
And didn't even fuck, MAN WHAT THE FUCK?!

The place where I be laying low, lamping in my hometown
Niggas ain't trippin' so I get's to keep my chrome down
And I be dippin around the spots where the niggas pass

Making dollars, hoes holla, definitely bring ya drama
Uh, but I don't sweat it fool, I come from where the best ride
Ain't no punks where I'm from on that west side
PA nigga, a lil town with big nuts
Where outta town motherfuckers lose they life on the cuts
But we ain't trippin', pass that dipplin'
It's gonna be all right, soon as I get fried tonight
Yeah bitch, I got ya ho, but ho I'll break ya knees

Well I'm Pimp C, bitch, I'm smoking big fat dank
I don't fuck around no mo with that god damn drank
But every time I get with my nigga 
Big Mike
We go and get a bottle of that Dom all nice
I got that green monster baby can you buy that?
Plus I got Swisha Sweet for days, you wanna try that?
I roll em up so big and fat they look like ball bats
I live in P-A-T, the east side, nigga, San Jac
These laws be trippin cause they think I'm selling much crack
They just can't stand to see a nigga roll in Cadillac
But I bought it cash and I don't think that you can take it back
I feel like Goldie every day I think I'm living the Mack
And I ain't trippin flippin then switches taking a trip to the 'Backs
Cause my nigga D called me and said that bitch was gonna be packed

How Long Can It Last,Underground Kingz,2007.0,"Dear Lord
I know You don't condone the things I be doin out here in these streets
(Help me, Lord) And I hope that, I pray that You can overlook
(Help me, Lord) the wrong that I had done in my life...
I don't know no other way to survive out here
(Wrap your arms around me, Lord)
I got a whole bunch of people dependin on me...
Just walk with me...
Walk with me...

Busslin and gamblin, hit licks scramblin
Bricks I'm out here handlin, I'm pimpin and I'm payin the rent
Didn't choose this dirty game, this dirty game it chose me
Every city love cocaine, they'll get it from him if they don't get it from me
So I get cross-country wit that thang, makin that crisp, lettin 'em hang
Bangin that 'Pac, if I die tonight, least mama know I didn't die in vain
Cause I put up sum from every sale, so all my chil'ren can live well
Might go to heaven, might go to hell, but just put me in wood grain lane Deville
I wonder sometime how life would be, if it was no such thing as D
But then I put that Sweet down, cause that bullshit don't apply to me
Cause out here on the real streets, a dreamer always stay sleep
Cause out here the strong survive, and now they didn't die from thankin weak
Gotta play for keeps, gotta play it HARD, still tryna get right with GOD
Still read my Bible lone, cause Reverend do wrong, still livin fraud
Tonight if I get down on my knees and ask the Lord to forgive me, please
You thank He gon' hear me? Cause tomorrow I'm still gon be slangin keyyyyys...

Out here livin fast (livin too fast)
How long can it last? (How long, how long, how long, will it last, baby?)

See I was born in the ghetto manye I was raised in the hood
And unless you lived it yourself, it just can't be understood

But it's hard when that environment you live in ain't healthy (healthy)
You ain't givin no hope (hope), nobody showin you pride (pride)
And you live with all this anger and frustration inside (side)
Dog, don't let nobody tell you what you can or you can't do

You can be who you wanna be (uh), live life how you feel
Just put your faith in the Lord (yep), now that's keepin it Trill, fo' real!

Out here livin fast (livin too fast, livin too fast)
How long can it last? (How long can it last, how long can it last right now??)

UHHHHH! I wonder if it's a heaven up there for real G's
For all the niggas in the game that's been slangin cheese
For all them boys on them swangers and the fifth wheel
I'm out here riskin my life, niggas shife but I stay Trill
I pray so much, I wonder if the Lord love me
I think He do, but I'm so caught up in my thug deep
The feds bug me, followin me around for three
Niggas couldn't catch me so they hit me wit conspiracy
(Uh) You know that that's the other level of the GAME
Ain't got shit on me but some niggas said my NAAAAAME..
So here they COOOME, they thang TIIIIIIGHT
They playin shife, no Bun givin me life
(Uhh!) I ain't goin back, I'mma make 'em kill me

I can give a rat's ass where a rapper is from
I remember N.W.A. and PE
Had me feelin like a rapper was the thing to be
You can't fuck with Willie D, UGK either
Disrepsecting the code, jealous muthafuckas need to

Quit hatin the South... (baby)
We gettin paper in the South... (gettin money)

To all the radio, T.V., and even the presses
Been hatin on the Sizz-outh like we ain't ready
Y'all think we came here to play, say man we came in the stay
Y'all shoulda listened to Andre, bitch we got somethin to say
And all you washed up rappers, you ain't what it's about
I see y'all tryna rap like us and puttin grills in ya mouth
Y'all buy the beat, buy the beat, like y'all bouncin and twerkn
But ho we know what's goin on and bitch that bullshit ain't workin
I'mma O.G. Rock Balll, write my name up on the wall
Fuck yo' bitch and hit the switch and put my dick up in her jaw
(I'm Sweet) Jones, fuck a clone, legend on the microphone
Player's choice, silky voice, keep yo' bitch's pussy moist
I bump that Screw, that's how I do, sippin drank, byzantine link
In Benz, big blue lens, knock this bitch and fuck with her friend
Candy car, exquisite mouth, bought the ranch man fuck the house
And y'all still gotta buy y'al dope from us so what the fuck you bitch
Niggas talkin 'bout? {*echoes*}

All you ole sensitive ass niggas! Knalmtalkinbout?
Y'all niggas on y'all period up there BITCH!
Knalmtalkinbout? Y'all hide behind them e-mail addresses
Sending that bullshit through the air!
Bitch! Say my name bitch, I'mma come to ya house!
Fuck how you feel, country rap tunes NIGGA!
They put all y'all records on one side of the store
And put all the country rap music on the other side of the store
And see who sell out first... bitch ass nigga!
It's ya own fault ya shit ain't sellin!
You reap what you sew!
Fuck you in ya pussy!
Keep talkin that shit, them young gladiators go come get you too patna!

Cocaine in the Back of the Ride,The Southern Way,1988.0,"Pimp C bitch! So what the fuck is up?
Step wrong nigga and I'll take ya fuckin nuts!
Got more dope than a pharmacy ho
Got a job for the city bitch, I'm shoveling snow
South Texas motherfucker that's where I stay
Gettin pussy from these bitches every god damn day
Kick it with a trill nigga so you best not trip
Bought the Caddy crossed the pier and kicked to Ganksta Nip
Selling weight, get it straight, fuck them 20s and 10's
Only love my fuckin momma no such thing as no friends
Motherfucker either down or the motherfucker ain't
And if ya bitch-ass ain't, then ya dick is in the paint
If ya gal look fine you better hide the bitch
Cause if I find her I'mma fuckin make her suck my dick
That goes for your momma and your sister too
And if I'm locked down in jail that shit might go for you
Don't try to get no false nuts, I take 'em sucker
Fuckin 'round with C you'll be a dead motherfucker
Nigga only 17 but I'm runnin the show
Sellin dope from Louisiana down to El Segundo, ha!
I think it's only fair that I should knock on wood
Cause my bitch is on the street, pussy sell real good
And all my ho know not to trip, bitch fuck pitty
I'll take out my nine and shoot ya in ya fuckin titty
Ho niggas forty-five tryin to, get with me
Sellin fifty dollar slabs as I'm slangin them ki's

Cocaine in the back of the ride (Yeeeeeah, motherfucker!)

Aiyyo it's Bun B bitch, and I'm the king of the hubba trade
Pockets fat as fuck from all the ducats the brother made
Hoes like to jock, but see I try to contain 'em
They droppin them drawers because I move they cocaine in
But I just laugh, cause pussy games be triflin
The legs get spread, I cut that ass like a knife then
Bust a nut on her stomach, wash my dick in the sink
And buy a 40 at the store, from the god damn chink
Dope games keep ya SICK, just like a disease
Movin ki's makin G's, hoes drop to they knees
Little kids on the corner, steady grabbin they nuts
Sayin, ""I wish I was Bun when I grow the fuck up""
Baby blue Riviera, Dayton and laced rims
Khaki pants, black sweater with the U.G.K. brim
Black gat fully loaded nigga come with respect
Step up the wrong way I'll break yo' god damn neck
Big dick in my drawers, the niggas from down South
Down to put a twelve gauge in yo' god damn mouth!
Think I'm playin bitch try me, it ain't no thang
Put them hands up bitch, and kiss this god damn ring
Cause I move tons of dope, twenty-four hours a day
Cocaine from Argentina to the 'Frisco bay
DEA try to stop me yo, but they shit ain't cold
Cause the nigga's got politicians on the Big Tyme payroll
Narcotic agents wearin cement shoes
Reported missin on the news, they singin the blues!
And if my money get fucked, I'll let it slide
It's just some mo' cocaine in the back of the ride, bitch!


Yo, I wanna send this shit out to them motherfuckers

South Texas in the house, on the behalf of myself

One motherfucker, two motherfuckers
Three motherfuckers, fo' - wanna squab with me
Over they, motherfuckin ho
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up off my dick nigga!
Befo' you have to deal wit my motherfuckin trigger
I don't figure that it's worth all that, G
Gettin yo' ass shot, cause ya bitch gave me the pussy
Don't it feel funny when you go down ta eat her
Knowin that you suckin on another nigga's peter
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bliss
Knowin that ya swallowed all that semen and that piss?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda kicked yo' ass instead I told ya somethin good, bitch!

TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah...yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)

Fo' motherfucker, three motherfucker
Two motherfucker, one - get a fuckin gun, cause it's fuckin Bun
Ain't no ho shit, I'm packin that lead
Nine pointed at yo' head, I guess you know yo' ass is dead
You bought yo' boys like you wanted to squab
But instead of a fist, I let my gat do the job
Now I don't know what time you be livin in
But fuck a fight, I bet my gun'll have you givin in
Wanna pull a knife when my .45 is cocked back
A bullet in yo' ass, I bet yo' bitch'll jock that
..Now you on your deathbed and cain't even hum right
But that's what you get for bringin hands to a gun fight

(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)

Niggas nowadays got a habit that they really need to quit
Gettin they ass kicked over a skank ass bitch
You need to check ya ho and ya need to check her fast
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her fuckin ass
But I ain't bout to fuck her, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the ass like government cheese
But not me nigga, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had yo' test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fuck with me
You need to be lookin for a fuckin MD!
But if you don't step, I'mma draw on ya fast
And pump off lead like dash in yo' ass
I didn't do fuck ya girl but your sister pussy tight
Fucked her in my homeboy's Caddy last night
She sucked my dick, I bust a nut in her throat
And she didn't take it out, and she didn't even choke
I fucked her doggystyle and the bitch just THREW ME
Turned me on my stomach, started lickin out my BOOTY
Now everybody in the hood
Know that your sister lick a booty real good, hehhahaha!


Now brothers need to get they shit straight
These lyrics that I'm stressin goin farther than this tape
It just ain't a song, motherfucker, it's the real!
If yo' ass ain't trill, BITCH, you shuffled in the deal
See, I tell the shit like I see it
You open up ya nuts and I'mma knee it
If you don't like it, so be it
I learn how to walk, I learn how to run
I learn how to squab and then I bought a fuckin gun
And now I got an attitude adjuster -
A nine wit a sixteen shot clip and I'm ready to bust ya
Lips get swoller, the punks get rolled-up
Them niggas get shot, and UGK STILL hold nuts
Raised on the streets, and yo I never said I wasn't
The hookers are the nieces, the fiends are my cousins
The dealers are my brothers, so FUCK you, ho!
I thank my family for my 'Lac, wit the trues and Vogues
Cause I can remember when I was back at ?Wentrel?
A little BAD nigga that was up to no good, yo
I told a nigga, ""Fuck you!"" and couldn't even back it up
Then fucked around and got smacked up
So I got my boys and we beat that ass down
Threw him off to Sea World, and watched his ass drown
Niggas knew who did it, but what could they say?
Not only got my crew, I got my nine and my AK
And I'mma roll the streets, any-fuckin-way I want to
And if you think you the shit, nigga I want you
I keep my dope, my hoes, and my motherfuckin hood
To my side, so FUCK sayin somethin good!!",https://genius.com/Ugk-something-good-the-southern-way-version-lyrics

And that nigga that you live with ain't like me
Ain't from Atlanta but I know these hoes like me
They pulling on my zipper wanna bite me

In the bed with her head in a jib
Eating on my dick like its some corn or a barbeque rib
Drop it to the floor, let me fuck with you
Get the camera out, bitch I'm finna take some pictures

Real stuck on that backside, It's looking kind of right
With the juicy tank top and louis vuitton heels
All bullshit aside, she looking ready to kill
But when I say kill, I mean murder the cot

She ain't watching the clock, ain't finna answer the phone

Put your feet in the sky, bring your knees to your chest
Grab a hold to the sheets bitch, and I'mma do the rest
Get to pressing on your pink, gripping on your soft
To the side, take a ride, From the back I break you off

I want some pussy and some navel and some ass and some mouth
I ain't fucking for me bitch, I'm fucking for the whole south
Show me what you working with, bitch what you got
I really wanted to fuck but ho you went and shaved your cot
A bald head pussy ain't shit, got them razer bumps bitch
Grow some hair and get legit

Big Dick Cheney and Tony Snow, (cocaine cocaine)

Uh the bitch, been good to me
Been bad to my homies, keep it cool with me
I played it by the rules, and the regulations
I use to switch cars with the Mexican, at the gas station
Mine had money in it, his had the work
After the deal was done, I make my girl pussy squirt
Cause after the deal, we would all celebrate
Happy cause it wasn't no jacking, and the product was straight
I never came, with the funny business
That's why we steady playing in Jags, and Benzes
Some niggas, let the city eat em up
I was just coming up, whipping my pyrex steady beating it up
I'm a shark with the fork, microwave or pot
I'mma hit it with the Sprite, and make that butter lock
Everything was cool, I was ice cold
Till I let that bitch, get up in my nose

Cocaine, cocaine

They call it cocaine, coc-a-ina, yayo
Coca leaf, whatever you wanna say bro
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, it ain't hum-drum
And we all know where it's at, but where it come from
The mountains of Colombia, and Peru
Extracted from the coca leaf, but see that shit ain't new
It's been around for hundreds of years, exploited by the rich
They even use to put it in Coca-Cola, ain't that a bitch
You had kings, queens, princes and princesses
Even priests and popes, fought to getting it in different instances
A privileged possession, for dozens of centuries
Helped a few wars, legal and illegal industries
Grown by the cartels, protected by gorillas
Transported by the best, to the ghettos to straight killers
The power of the powder pimping, you don't understand
Ask W man, he's a dealer and a fan of cocaine


You chilling on the corner, looking cooler than a mo'fucker
Got a pocket full of hard, it's hotter than a mo'fucker
Living in that condition, my Phantom in the front yard
We them real dope boys, I ain't gotta front dog
Big dope in the trunk, following my Map Quest
Choppers in the white house, pistol on my lap yes
I remember, when I first met that wonderful girl
Club Rolex, she fathered my mother a pearl
Spinning wild living foul, diamonds all in my dial
Pimping style, but they yayo got me wearing linen now
Getting paper, paper plates on convertables
M-I-yAyo to P-A, that work'll move
Ricky Ross, only fuck with legends
Pimp C, Bun B got the hustle perfected
I could ship it to ya, or you could come and get it
Just bring the cool million with ya, when you come and visit (Ross)",https://genius.com/Ugk-cocaine-lyrics
Good Stuff,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"Motherfuckers kissin', man, they still kissin'. Nigga's jackin' they dick up under the car, all of that. I don't participate in that, myself, shit. Fuck that. I need to get me some motherfuckin' ass, some hash, some ooh-ya-ya

Where the hoes, where the hoes
Lookin', lookin', tighten up, tryin' to tighten up
Where the hoes, where the hoes
Check it out

I'm coming down candy, I put in my work
Got a $10,000 link medallion hangin' on a $2,000 shirt
The game's been good
And all the hoes wanna sit on leather and the wood
Bitches tryin' to price my diamonds
But that shit is just so common
Cause they see a nigga shinin'
But I'm movin' too fast
96 karats if you think that you could manage
Got the drink and the salad
Now the bitch is on the jag
I'm comin' down Gulf way, I'm tryin' to see what's up
I see big ass and some titties
Now we flippin' in the 'Burban to the city
The attitude's shitty but I barred no plex
Ain't talkin' 'bout the Malcolm but I'm ridin' on the X
The highway was so wet, I'm slippin' out my lane
The bitch was on her knees, but now she's runnin' me a game
I bet you never seen a big truck like that
I bet you never got a dick sucked like that
The bitch didn't know that I was tapin' the whole scene
Now we watchin' that bitch suck me on a 5 piece screen
The glitter and the gleam, we saw them in the show
Chauffeurs and the sofas, hotel pictures and the hoes
I got the haters, and the jackers, and the million dollar crackers
Tryin' to close me down, but I got ghetto love
I'm Pimp C bitch, I'm comin' down richer than rich
So bitch you know you gotta gimme good stuff

Lookin' for that good stuff
Ba ba babada da da
Tighten up on your backstroke
Ba ba babada da da
Lookin' for that good stuff
Tighten up on your backstroke
Comin' down on fresh paint
Blowin' Swisher Sweet smoke

We flippin' worldwide, P.A.T. International jetsetters
Bigger than the Hollywood letters
But don't get us confused, you lose when you bet us
Breakin' off the jealous with pitch black Barettas
My fellas and tellers who holdin' plex against them Texas boys
Bringin' the noise to haters in 9-6 plex
Like you major boy you have done played yourself
Too $hort smoked you like a Newport, and you bought
A one-way ticket to something bigger than you
Over your head and got scared
Exactly what I figured you'd do
Now who you kiddin', I'm slangin', bangin', and skiddin'
Busta playa moves and if you done it and did it
As I sit in the lap of luxury
DEA is tryin' to stick bugs to me
Undercover motherfucker tried to sell drugs to me
What could be more throw
Mafioso's puttin' bombs under my load
Never show no grief miss the signs in the climate
Now I'm comin' down shinin'
Pieces and chains full of diamonds
I'm winin' and dinin' and Caligula
Pretty boys gettin' off the hook
Bitches sayin' but I'm diggin' ya
But I know that make ya mega crunk
And make ya make it man it make a nigga wanna pop trunk
Got skunk from the Rasta, eatin' pasta, steak and lobster
Like a mobster and gots to be lookin' for the good stuff

Lookin' for that good stuff

Tighten up on your backstroke

 (star)
Now, all these niggas wanna fuck my car
She a video ho, the bitch make big money
Like to let her hair down when the sky get sunny
You can catch her in the Dub or the King magazine ('Zine)
Young red bitch, pussy wet, five screens (Five screens)
Now watch her fat ass drop (Drop)
Fifth pouring out, and the trunk gets popped (Gets popped)
These niggas scheming on my young ho
Niggas so gung-ho, bitch can't let me go (Let me go)
I bring the bitch value up ten times (Ugh)
It's going higher every time I write another line
I get my paper in the streets
Big cocaine, grip grain and pimp the lane (Pimp the lane)
I really miss Robert Davis
I'm repping for you, baby, leave these niggas on the pavement

I got the grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman

I fell in love with my chrome plated woman

Well, let me introduce you to the baddest bitch alive
Can't nothing fuck with her (With her) when I put her in drive
Other hoes got four shoes, but mine got five (she got five)
And got the hood buzzing like a beehive
She's immaculately dressed, with good hygiene
Take a bath everyday, 'cause she gots to stay clean
I wipe her down slow with a real soft rag
Now, she looking so good (Good) a nigga gots to brag (I gots to brag)
When we pull up, my nigga, we stop to show
You'll probably kill yourself when you see the suicide doors
In the summertime, she might come outside without a top (Without a top)
And one look'll make a nigga mouth drop (Your mouth drop)
We don't stop, we keep it rollin like a ball
With a bitch this bad, how could a nigga take a fall?
Naww, she ain't for y'all, you gots to get your own
Just make sure that she's covered in chrome, c'mon

I got the grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming
I fell in love with my chrome plated woman

On the highway (Way), living the fly way (Fly way)
Bitch on my hood, guidin my way (Ugh)
Money on the nightstand, never did lay (Lay)
True to the game, I put that on P.A
P.A., still gettin sucked under the streetlights (Ugh)
And nigga, it sure feel good when you're living right (Living right)
Eating right (Eating right), fucking right (Ugh)
Steady pimping bitches through my website

So get your head right (Head right)
And get your bread right (Bread right)
'Cause babygirl'll hit you in your chest dead right
Have it on your mind 'cause she'll put it in your heart
The game'll be over 'fore the motor even start
With the brand new parts, (What?) got them boys erupting
But don't call it plastic surgery, it's body sculpting
Take a old school, give it new car sense
And then, I don't regret one motherfucking dollar I spent, man

I fell in love with my chrome plated woman
The grill on the front, trunk steady humming

Use Me Up,Too Hard to Swallow,1992.0,"I got a girl and she treat me fine
But the homies all think that I'm losin my mind
I'm trippin and I know it cause I'm all nerved up
Cause everytime I go to sleep, I see this big ol' butt
See I ain't never gave no chick fo' stars
But she treat me so good that she be drivin my car
And everyday it get better, I cain't lie
Went to the house and she made me some hot potato pie
All my friends be sayin, ""She ain't nothin but a scrub""
But she make me feel high like I'm, hooked on drugs
So I give her what she need, and what's done is done
But I'm a special kind of fool but aiyyo it don't bother me none
I cain't help myself, I know that I'm trippin
But she got it goin on like Kentucky Fried Chicken
So everytime she ask me for my, credit card
You know she get it cause ya know that... (Chill, C) I know, G
I used to be the playa, now I'm gettin pimped
I used to be hard, now I'm livin all limp
Why I let her play me? You cain't understand!
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man...

I-yi-yi-yi-I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin used
Oh, you can just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up

I been to the mountain top, and down to the valley low
Went to Austin with 3-2 and STILL ain't find no finer hoe
Not much no finer girl, but one that treat me so sweet
Rub my back, when I'm so' and cook me somethin good to eat
She worked me so hard 'til I, hurt my back
So I'm passin out them ducats and them, Kroger sacks
And everybody wonderin why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I won't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, axe me why I wanna dis her
I told her cause her lovin ain't better than her sister
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she always do me up
Bun say I'm trippin out, and Byrd say I'm trippin, too
But this time I just can't LISTEN to my whole crew
Cause back in the day, I vowed to never change my pimp game
But '92 came around, and thangs go insane
I gotta get my thang back on track
But the mo' I try to stay away, the mo' I comes back
Why I let her play me? You can't understand!
So sit yourself down and just listen to my man...

I-yi-yi-yi-I, said brother, if you only knew
You'd wish that you were in my shoes
You just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...
Until you use me up...

Until you use me up...
Until you use me up
I-yi-yi-yi-I, wanna spread the news
That if it feels this good gettin used
Oh, you can just keep usin me...
Until you use me up...

To sum it all up, I'm breakin ALL my rules
Cause she got me droppin off her little brother to school
I be gettin bills, and stubs from checks
I work all day, just to spend it on sex
But all that really matters is I'm happy, dude
And I be happy long as I get good soul food
UGK sayin peace out, and plenty of luck
And she could keep usin Pimp C - uh, just a use me up!

Ain’t That a Bitch (Ask Yourself),Dirty Money,2001.0,"Uhh, you stayin' with that bitch, layin' with that bitch
Fuckin' all your paper off, playin' with that bitch
At first, all you want to do was fuck with the bitch
Years passed by, now you stuck with that bitch
Ya fighting mo' and mo' now you fed up with the bitch
But you knew that was a ho when you hooked up with the bitch
But you trusted the bitch, cause you lust for the bitch
Ya suck on the pussy and bust nuts in the bitch
Now she around this motherfucka pregnant and shit
But a child to a bitch, is seen as nothin' but a lic
The next thing you know the bitch gotcha in court
Tryin' to getcha paper, calling it ""child support""
Takin' half of yo' shit, talkin' bout a divorce
If you don't know the game, then here's a crash=course
They say, ""You live with the bitch, so ya common-law married
And the bitch done got accustomed to the paper she been havin'""

Ain't that a bitch? (
Ain't that a bitch?

Ain't that a bitch? Now, ask yourself;
Ain't that a bitch? Ohh
Ain't that a bitch?

I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened, and read it, it said, ""Fuck UGK
We've been watching your success ever since you niggas dropped
We would've spoke a long time, but we thought you would've flopped
Man, two niggas got some nuts, to graduate to mainstream status
From being two broke bastards from off the cuts, growing up in a town
Where population fifty thousand, only three high schools, but eight sets of low-income housing
Look, when you two did 
Too Hard to Swallow
, we thought it was a fluke
When you boys came 
Super Tight
, we played it cool hand Luke
Ridin' Dirty
 went gold with no video, we gave a break
But this MTV award nomination shit just took the cake
So read this letter real good and take it as a warning
We'll be watching you when you sleep and when you wake up in the morning
The people that you running with and everything you do
Sincerely, yours, signed—nigga, you know motherfuckin' who.""
[Chorus: Devin The Dude + 
 Bun B

(
Ain't that a bitch?
) Ain't that a bitch? Ohh
Ain't that a bitch? Now, ask yourself;
Ain't that a bitch? Ohh
Ain't that a bitch?

And just when you thought that pussy was specially for you
You put all your trust in the bitch and guess what she do?
Round two in the mornin' that ho's gone
Then she come with some different clothes on
I guess the bitch is so fine, that you pay it no mind
You asked her where she been, she said ""with one of her friends"" that ho lying
Her pussy is a gold mine, well that how she feels
And she can get a few thangs in exchange for cheap thrills
The price of pussy is turning some women to whores
And just because they give you some pussy, it ain't yours
So I don't trip on it, but I'll stab if I can
Then wipe off my weapon, and turn into the traveling man
See like I fucked Ruby Tuesday, but Friday I'd had to slap that ho
The bitch got knocked up by Rosco, and said I'm the poppa though
In this game they got a name for a chick, who's gettin' rich for lickin' nuts and dick
Ain't that a bitch?

Ain't that a bitch? Ohh
Ain't that a bitch? Now, ask yourself;
Ain't that a bitch? Ohh
Ain't that a bitch?
Ain't that a bitch? Ohh
Ain't that a bitch? Now, ask yourself;

Tell Me Something Good,The Southern Way,1992.0,"One motherfucker, two motherfuckers
Three motherfuckers, fo' - wanna squab with me
Over they, motherfuckin hoe
Tell 'em like this, ya better get up off my dick nigga!
Befo' you have to deal wit my motherfuckin trigger
I don't figure that it's worth all that, G
Gettin yo' ass shot, cause ya bitch gave me the pussy
Don't it feel funny when you go down ta eat her
Knowin that you suckin on another nigga's peter
And when ya get a kiss, do ya feel bliss
Knowin that ya swallowed all that semen and that piss?
You wanna step to me but I don't really think ya should
I shoulda kicked yo' ass instead I told ya somethin good, bitch!

TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)
TELL me something GOOD (Oh yeaaaaah...yeah)
Tell-TELL me something GOOD (Ohhhhhhh-HOO!, tell me, tell me...)
TELL me something GOOD (Ohhh, baby, baby, baby yeah)

Fo' motherfucker, three motherfucker
Two motherfucker, one - get a fuckin gun, cause it's fuckin Bun
Ain't no hoe shit, I'm packin that lead
Nine pointed at yo' head, I guess you know yo' ass is dead
You bought yo' boys like you wanted to squab
But instead of a fist, I let my gat do the job
Now I don't know what time you be livin in
But fuck a fight, I bet my gun'll have you givin in
Wanna pull a knife when my .45 is cocked back
A bullet in yo' ass, I bet yo' bitch'll jock that
..Now you on your deathbed and cain't even hum right
But that's what you get for bringin hands to a gun fight

(Ohhhhhhh-HOO!)

Niggas nowadays got a habit that they really need to quit
Gettin they ass kicked over a skank ass bitch
You need to check ya hoe and ya need to check her fast
Cause if you know like me, you would drop her fuckin ass
But I ain't bout to fuck her, cause I'm scared of that disease
Cause she's passin' out the ass like government cheese
But not me nigga, cause Pimp C wanna live
Have you had yo' test? Are you H-I positive?
But instead of gettin checked you wanna fuck with me
You need to be lookin for a fuckin MD!
But if you don't step, I'ma draw on ya fast
And pump off lead like dash in yo' ass
I didn't do fuck ya girl but your sister pussy tight
Fucked her to my homeboy's Caddy last night
She sucked my dick, I bust a nut in her throat
And she didn't take it out, and she didn't even choke
I fucked her doggystyle and the bitch just THREW ME
Turned me on my stomach, started lickin out\\n my BOOTY
Now everybody in the hood
Know that your sister lick a booty real good, hehhahaha!


Now brothers need to get they shit straight
These lyrics that I'm stressin goin farther than this tape
It just ain't a song, motherfucker, it's the real!
If yo' ass ain't trill, BITCH, you shuffled in the deal
See, I tell the shit like I see it
You open up ya nuts and I'ma knee it
If you don't like it, so be it
I learn how to walk, I learn how to run
I learn how to squab and then I bought a fuckin gun
And now I got an attitude adjuster -
A nine wit a sixteen shot clip and I'm ready to bust ya
Lips get swoller, the punks get rolled-up
Them niggas get shot, and UGK STILL hold nuts
Raised on the streets, and yo I never said I wasn't
The hookers are the nieces, the fiends are my cousins
The dealers are my brothers, so FUCK you, hoe!
I thank my family for my 'Lac, wit the trues and Vogues
Cause I can remember when I was back at Woodrow
A little BAD nigga that was up to no good, yo
I told a nigga, ""Fuck you!"" and couldn't even back it up
Then fucked around and got smacked up
So I got my boys and we beat that ass down
Threw him off to Sea World, and watched his ass drown
Niggas knew who did it, but what could they say?
Not only got my crew, I got my nine and my AK
And I'ma roll the streets, any-fuckin-way I want to
And if you think you the shit, nigga I want you
I keep my dope, my hoes, and my motherfuckin hood
To my side, so FUCK sayin somethin good!!",https://genius.com/Ugk-tell-me-something-good-lyrics

About this nigga talkin' 'bout a Pimp C wig he gon' split
I laughed then I dashed 'cause I'm fuckin' his chick
She told me all she wanna do is ride my dick
She kick it with the nigga 'cause he give her the stacks
But every fucking night I try to break her fuckin' back
And now the nigga say that he wanna fight
But if you fuck around, I'll put that fire in his life
Man, keep fuckin' that broad, and if he trip then it's on
Never let a nigga say you a broad—prove him wrong
Fool, I'm fuckin' this nigga' gal now and he know it
Got a fist but won't throw it, talkin' shit but won't show it
Yo, it ain't nothing goin' on but nuts on naked tricks
They never fakin' licks, suckin' dick while I'm takin' shits
I do a bitch bad and treat a nigga worse

A dip, dip, nigga, trip, trip—ya fried
I took my fuckin' pistol, shot a dope-fiend in his eye
I ain't got no love for you fuckin' hoes
I'm hot from smokin' click, I gotcha drippin' on my fuckin' clothes
I got that fire bumpin' in my brain
I'm thinking to myself, ""I need to go to sellin' 'caine""
And all the time, I'm bumpin' WC
'Cause it seem like he the only nigga making sense to me
And the shit ain't really the same
It's movin' too fast, I dips with this water, will it open my ave?

I promise; anybody tryna to be a bold bastard
Gettin' fried like that dip, I'm full of that dank and ready to trip
It's been a lot of niggas swearin' that they hard
Like I care, and I be sharin' slugs with some of them studs if somebody darin'
Tearin' hoes in half, laugh and hit the blunt
And give it away, and see which one these niggas won't be livin' today
Haters, what's up? 
Got me a cup of that Erk & Jerk, puttin' in work
Till I'm blowed
, and never the 5-4 bitch 'cause I'm too cold
I explode like a bomb, droppin' 'em daily, so don't say we

It might not be all bad as it first seems... (I used to walk around with a bag full of rappers)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh

Them hoes can lock my body up, but they can't lock my mind

I call some women bitches and I call some women whores
A bitch a dirty boar, a ho open up the pussy store
Now what's the difference between the two? Man, I just told you that
But that don't mean that every woman I know is down with that
If you a bitch and wanna switch, it ain't too late to change
It's all about how you carry yo'self and how you handle thangs
Some say that hoes and pimps is born, I don't believe that shit
Cause anytime you wanna stop, it ain't too late to quit
Just cause you sold your body don't mean you a ho for life
I got to speak it right for all the one that paid the price
But if ya in it to win it, go head and live the life
But baby, if you ain't in it, you still can do it right

You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money

To all the babies havin babies on ya' own
I know you feelin fucked up and feelin all alone
I know ya people tellin you, ""Ya fucked up your life""
Ya only fucked up if you lay down and don't continue to fight - uh!
And to the young nigga out there tryna sell dope
I know ya family fucked up and it's your last rope
In your heart, I know ya cold with this rhyme shit
But ain't nuttin hap'nin but this twenty and this dime shit
And you the daddy wit lil' mama that's bout to have the baby
You wanna own ya team but niggas tellin you, ""Ya crazy""
""What you thankin? You too young to have a family""
But all the moves ya makin, look like you a man to me!
When you get caught up man them niggas ain't gon ride witchu
But get down wit that girl and she gon keep it live witchu
But she gon help ya put your money up and save somethin
Cause right now ya run it, th'ew it back and you ain't made nuttin
It's time to change sumthin

You can't let no bitch shatter yo' dreams... (hmm...)
It might not be all bad as it first seems... (hmm...)
You might not have all the things you need, yeah-heh
But all you got to do is believe
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah
I got to get my money-hey, oh-ho
You got to get yo' money-hey, yeah-eah
I got to get my money-hey, yeah-eah... - you got to get yo' money

If you a ballplayer, man go 'head and play ball
Don't let nobody steal your dream if you ain't came to fall
I know they say, ""It ain't enough room in the NBA""
You tell them haters, ""Save that bullshit for another day""
If you a sanger, lil' mama go 'head and sang ya song
Them hoes say, ""You ain't gon make it"", the funky bitch is wrong
You ain't got to get butt-naked on stage in a thong
Just sang your records to show the people you got it goin on
I see a whole lotta motherfuckers come and go
I know young niggas sold they soul for the dirty dough
They want a rapper, I understand go 'head and chase ya dream
But chase too hard, give up the lord and end up like a fiend
Some people gay, what can I say? The only judge is God
But don't be ashamed and try to hide cause then you livin fraud
Cause everythang done in the dark, gon' come to the light
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right
Right, right, right, right
So do yo' thang, cause cain't no man tell you what's wrong or right

Still Ridin’ Dirty,Underground Kingz,2007.0,"Look me in my eyes playa, tell me what you see
If you man enough to face it, a muthafuckin G
If you man enough to say it, the muthafuckin one
One that none wanna play wit, muthafuckin Bun
Many have come and most would go, yet
He remains as most would know (most would know)
Came in with less than the ones befo' him
A Sweet full of 'dro, (and what?) a cup of Pro-M (huh!)
Muthafuckas would act like they ain't know him
His mentality was, ""Fuck that, I'll show them""
Made men mad or not, rich men getting scared
Trill 'til I D-I-E, I didn't care
Ridin on fo' bald tires wit no spare
No nuts, no glory and I'm ready to go there
And I can't...

I can't explain the way I feel
When I'm behind the wheel.. (Still ridin' dirty)
Ohh... oh... oh...
I'm still ridin dirty
""Peep this game here, nigga I'm not no pimp. I pimped fifteen years ago
Nigga, I got DEGREES in playa..and pimpin on niggas
Hoes, err'y nigga get in my face, I'll play on 'em. You up, nigga?""

Look me in my eyes nigga, tell me how you feel
When you see the Pimp, be shinin and grippin on the wheel
When you see the boy, be grindin, ain't nothin here for free
It's the one ya love to hate, call him Young Pimp C (Pimp C)
Niggas done tried, I'll bust they side
You can run up on my ride, I'mma look at your mind (look at your mind)
On the concrete, cauliflower on the street
Make ya jelly jump, ain't no need for this shit punk
Muthafuckas be playin like they can't get killed
Fuck what ya represent and fuck how you feel
Ho niggas eat a dick, blow you can get a brick
Twelve-five goin' live, Lamborghini wit the stick
Ridin up ten wit ten books and a half-breed
Tryna get to P.A. and the laws just passed me
And I can't...

""You in the WAY man on some real PLAYAS. Stompin' on them lil' Navigators and carryin on man. Gettin trucks under the year and puttin' spinners on it
YA FAKIN!!! CHURCH!""

I live off truth, you live off lies
So when yo shit falls short, don't even be surprised at all
You go off opinions and I got facts
So when yo shit don't add up, don't fix yo face to ask at all
You do what you can, I do what I feel (do what I feel)
And that there in ITSELF the definition of trill
You live by the gun, you die by the slugs mayne
You live off of fiends, you'll die behind drugs mayne
Them mean mugs hides tears and pain
And I can't feel your frustrations, so please refrain
You ain't got nothin to gain, from playin around
And I ain't got nothin to lose, in layin you down
I made a promise to make it home for the kids and the wife
(What that mean?) I didn't come to kill
But I will leave with yo' life, and I can't...


All I see is muthafuckin' laws galore, hot the pen and then I swore
Never be a stupid ass, I'll never hit the pen no mo'
Them hoes gave me eight and, nigga had ta pull half
It almost killed my mama when the feds bought the drama
The IRS say I owe 'em nine mill-ion
Took all the paper from my wife and my children
Hold my mama shit, my grandmamma and daddy too
Now tell me what the FUCK was I supposed to do?
No money on my books but I got my game
Had a young guard bitch to smuggle me in some cocaine
In her pussy, I'm jackin off smellin plastic
Slangin powder in the pen, shit drastic
It's money in this bitch, I send it all home
Locker full of food, big hygiene and a cell phone, BITCH
Knalmtalkinbout? And I made it home muthafucka..

All you funky-ass bitches out there..
Picture me rollin like 'Pac, BITCH

Mr. copper Mr. copper can we speak?
How many niggas do you beat down in a week?
And do you get a kick when you beat a nigga down with that muthafuckin' stick
So you can suck a nigga dick
Rodney King really fucked me up at first
But at least he didn't go home in no hearse
A lot of niggas dead, a lot of niggas died
Cause (pop pop pop) with yo muthafuckin' 9
But no me pappy, I'll cap that badge
A ratta-tat-tata-tat-tata-tat-tat uh yea
So don't even think about tryin' to play me bitch
I'll gat ya down with my fuckin' .38 ya bitch
Ya got suga in ya nuts just like them grip niggas
Ain't shit without that stick and that fuckin' trigga
And yo I think it is my duty
To slice some laws thoroughly, cause they killed my nigga Rudy and I don't think that's right

The policemen are your friends
(but all my niggas say)they're here to protect and serve
The policemen are your friends
(and all my niggas say)they're here to protect and serve

I try to keep my face off the street
Cause that 99 always wanna swear
It was me at the scene of the crime,I wasn't there
Bitch, I was at home with blistered feet
Soaking my dogs, with my gal smoking a Swisher Sweet
But before I could put my Nikes back on
I pulled to the curb by some blue and white tryin' to get there jack on
Even though I had the right inspection
Tricka they still dick a nigga like an erection
Lookin for a muthafuckin' criminal, he ain't here
Pussy muthafuckas', what color you painting fear
But you can color me bad
Like them crackas and there choking
But understand the real when its smoking
I'm loccin' and smokin', niggas is fightin' fast
Now your lil trifling ass is doomed to feel the boom of my titan of class
So with my 9 I'll buck up a trick
And a crooked cop just might get shot
Just for the fuck of it

The policemen are your friends
(but all my niggas say)they're here to protect and serve
The policemen are your friends
(and all my niggas say)they're here to protect and serve

Fuck the fast laws, make ya blow on the trigga squeeze
I don't want to kill a cop
I just wanna bust that nigga in his knees
And watch him squirm and squeal as I buck him there
Get down on the floor ho you ain't goin' no fuckin' where
One in yo arms, yo knees, yo shoulda
I'm laughin like Joker, now turn your punk ass over, bitch
But this ain't for my brotha
Its strictly for my niggas whose triggas died undercover, no lovas muthafuckas
Suck a dick, I'mma let you tell it
Bird state you be diggin' all y'all ass
And y'all know ya wanna smell it
Fools, so gon' take a sniff
And right before ya choke, catch the smoke
From the chrome and the spliff

Out, nigga, from the clique that don't stop
Barkin at a cop with a pocket full of rocks
So call the {​coroner}​ and tell him what I said
I know ya got a vest so I'm aiming at your head
Bloody, red, I'm going to your funeral I'm spraying hoes with lead
Fuck respect for the mutherfuckin' dead
Cause I don't give a fuck about a punk ass fed
I'm splittin' niggas wigs and leavin' pussies on they head
And I'll be goddamned if I don't hit, {​killing him}​
Tell {​Moody Harris}​ they gon' want to come and get 'em
So ashes to ashes and bless his soul
Now bend his ass over so I can fuck him with his stick in his asshole

Feel Like I’m the One Who’s Doing Dope,Too Hard to Swallow,1992.0,"I woke up at twelve on the dot
Went to my closet and I checked my matchbox
Two rocks gone, that's the third time this week
So I'm going to the bedroom to check this freak
I said yo bitch some mo' of my dope is gone
I know that you stole it so bitch you know it's on
She said before you kill me, here's a little token, the other night
I walked into the bedroom and it was you that was smokin
I said die bitch as I shot her in the head
Picked up my shirt from the side of the bed
Picked up my keys off the dresser
Stood over the bitch, blew her a kiss then I left her
I remember waking up later on that night
I'm in Lafayette and some shit just ain't right
My head feels tight and my mouth taste strange
Plus some bitch is in my trunk calling out my real name
How she know my name? Did I tell her? Who told her? Yo what's the tip?
Plus I feel a fever blister coming on my fuckin' lip
And you don't get that shit from smokin' buddha
The other night I woke up, in my hand was a straight-shooter
I could smell crack burnin' in the fuckin' air
I looked down, I didn't have on no underwear
Looked in my other hand and it was full of nut
I looked around, I'm butt-naked on the cut, I think I'm the one that's doing dope

*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 Shit, I can't cope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 Shit, I can't cope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 I can't cope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 Shit, I can't cope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 Huh, I can't cope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 Shit, I can't cope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 So get the rope
*Scarface - I feel like I'm the one that's doing dope*
 Fuck

My nigga Bird came and picked me up
Took me to Alvester and my mama cleaned me up
I'm feelin' half alive and I'm feelin' half dead
It felt kinda funny sleepin' in my old bed
My pager went off and it said to call my home
I put my drink down and I picked up the phone
Pat said this nigga just dropped off my pack
I went to Crook and told him drive me up to San Jac
But when I got to San Jac, I put the key in the door
It didn't hit, man this is a chance for some fucked up shit
I started knocking and a white man came to the door
I pulled my pistol and I shot the motherfuckin' ho
Went to my bedroom, there's a white bitch in my bed
I told her up the pussy bitch and give me some fuckin' head
She said I'll give you all my money just don't kill me though
I told the bitch that all I wanted was some pussy ho
Pussy was good but as I felt that second nut
I pulled my dick out, grabbed my knife and shoved it in her gut
I turned the knife around and shot nut on her chest
Look in her eyes and I can hear her take her last breath
And as I got up I look and yo it wasn't my bed
I look down, my carpet is tan this carpet is bloody red
This ain't my house it's one street away
I can't cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doing fucking dope!


I check myself into B.N.A
I'mma hurt myself if I don't get shit straight
To top the shit off they just give me more dope
I think I'm crazy now I'm at the end of my rope
My mama comes to see me every motherfuckin day
As much as I want to, I don't have nothing to say
I want to say I love her with all my damn heart
But hustlin' is a fiend and yo it's tearing her apart
I woke up that night with that same taste in my mouth
My mind just went bezerk, I gotta break the fuck out
I killed the bitch that's sitting at the front booth
I broke the guard's neck and put on his fucking suit
Took his keys and got to the doorway
In about 2 seconds, it's a smooth getaway
Got to the truck and I'm gone scot-free
What the fuck? A siren motherfucker's after me
If they take me they gon' have to take me dead
Before I go I'll put a bullet in my head
I try to hold 'em back but the teardrops comin' down
I let my foot off the gas and put my head to the ground
I put the gun to my temple and then I went click
I heard a ringing sound and woke up to my hard dick
I was crying, my girl told me Chad it's just a dream
I guess I ain't no motherfuckin' fiend

Texas where them trill ass niggas be livin naughty
Rollin' up ho's like turtles in half a shell
Open up my trunk and let's see what I have to sell
I got the dope, if you ho's got the paper
And if you a faker then you'll meet your fuckin maker
Cause I ain't takin no shit on my guts
The UGK posse got the big big nuts
Yo, so who's a bold bitch?
Try to make a sale, You betta bail before they find you in a ditch
This dope ain't yo dope and these cuts and yo cuts
Yo, but this is my 12 Gauge in your muthafuckin guts
Don't make me pump this bitch and unload
Beat your feet muthafucka, hit the muthafuckin road
And don't even try to come back nigga yo
Cause me Dre and C got fingers on a fat trigger
We making too much money moving weight
And before you hit my cuts, you better get your shit straight
Cause it ain't safe to just try and show your ass up
Street sweeper booming cold blow your ass up
And ain't nobody scared to blast
We pull them triggers fast
And then we bailing on your bitch ass
But if your shit is legit, then you can join my crew
U.S.T. graduating class of '92 in Short Texas


Niggas on the track dropping shit about T-X
As long as there's fiends that's them tax free dope checks
Young muthafuckas at the age of 16
Cooking up some yayo for the local drug king
The market's not open so they call it closed circuit
Short Short Texas watch them hard thugs work it
5-0's on the scene make the all time drug bust
Out next week slangin some more white dust
Real, oh so trill, the life's no glamour
At the end of my time is spent in the slammer
Fuckin up shit with the 9 inch chrome
So all you scary got-it-good young-ass bitches stay home
And if you get picked up by the laws
Don't cry cause it's for a lost cause
Clientele, ounce of yayo, in jail make bail
From longs to short, it's constant dope sales
Stupid muthafuckas smoking dummies and noids in jail
On U.S.T., Crack University
Home of the Fightin Fiends, the streets reimburse me
Cops finding my stash, yo what could the worst be
Through so going undercover then turnin dirty
Bitch, I'm dead and swole in a ditch
Just the other day, a fiend in your Lexus
Calling my name Blue Light, I'm Short Texas


I don't give a fuck who you be!
You ain't bout to sell no fuckin dope in P.A.T
You could be Tony Montana in this bitch
Have a boat load of dope, but you still ain't selling shit
Cause we don't know your face so I don't really figure
We gon let you come up and sell dope in Texas nigga
See you don't understand, it's our muthafuckin cuts
So step in, like I said before, we'll take them muthafuckin nuts
Ask the last nigga brought his fuckin ass down
Trying to sell that fuckin dope he bought in H-Town
Couldn't sell in Houston, so I guess he figured
I'mma go to Port Arthur and run them fuckin niggas
Brought his fuckin gun, guess he should've bust
So they took his shit and put his dick in the dust
Stupid ass nigga had the nerve to come back
Rolling on the cuts in his white Cadillac
Got to the block and the guns just exploded
Shot his car up with the 9, and the clip that he unloaded
Sent the nigga home to his momma like a ho
They jacked all his money and they stole all his dope
Can't be trill in the villa of the trillest
Cause where I'm from nigga house some muthafuckin killers

But I'mma keep it one hundred, when it come to the game
Tame attitude, they get the wolves to grouping up
They laying boys down, they future they scooping up
We keep it click tight, so when niggas start lurking
In the dark heaters start, anybody start jerking
Put my work in on the reg', the powder in the keg
A dragging society, don't borrow don't beg
For tomorrow so gon 'head with your pity, I'mma be cool
Kindergardeners was looking up to me, in pre-school
Down with Pimp C fool, and P-A-T the town
Representing it to the fullest, till I'm gone I hold it down

Punk niggas to the street, split they wig to the meat
Laying in they bloody red, then I leave their ass flat dead fool
And I bet that on my ass, I'm ready to get on my blast
And I ain't the easiest motherfucker to fly past
Last time I looked I wasn't wearin' panties so don't say I was
I'm from that Texas, I ain't your blood and I ain't your cuz
I'm just that nigga trying to make life as easy as I can
But 
most of these punk ass niggas don't understand the plan
 I got
Now they hot, walkin' round pissed off but I ain't worried
Im lettin' off bullets in a hurry, and my people scurry
Cause I'm full of that damn dank and drank
So I'm finna shank your ass and while you're layin' in the grass
Thinkin' that I was the nigga that you fucked wit'
Gun stick to ya lips, I'm from P.A. nigga, don't fuck wit'

Fuckin hoes wit' big ol' thighs, 
and bucking niggas 'til I die
Nigga you ain't running shit, fronting like you making stacks
Riding round my niggas' house in that old beat-up Cadillac
Yelling how you down with C, talking 'bout you book my shows
Never ever was my friend, always been my fucking foe
Never had no love for hoes, like that nigga ?? said
So nigga you dead soon as I buck you wit' that fuckin' lead
And that's more real than a bypass
You need to bend yourself over so I can boot you in your fuckin' ass
Ya think you're slick and so you're bigger, but I squeeze the trigger
Cause I'm bigger and I'm that underground nigga
Straight from P.A.T. where the shit don't stop
Niggas always gettin' smoked on the goddamn block
Short, Texas motherfucker, see I live in the bricks
Where the niggas smoke them Swishers and the bitches suck dick

That’s Why I Carry,Ridin’ Dirty,1996.0,"Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

My nigga, you done pushed the wrong button, I ain't never ran this hot
Now you the number one nigga I wanna whoop the piss out
And this not a threat, bet that, I ain't gonna let that shit slide
Gotta get that bitch right, want him dead by midnight
I followed him from his crib to the crack spot
I watched him go in and come back out, I got ready to pull the Mac out
Sandwiched him by the feeder of 610
Unloaded the pistol, now dirt is now what his dick in
Shit, I seen a slab get stripped
The discs, seats, and sound gone, and candy paint burnt to a crisp
These niggas gettin' hated on for the '84s that they skated on
Jackers in the dark alley waited on
The fool comin' out the gamblin' shack
Pistol to his back, took 4 ounces of crack, and a fat doja sack
That's why I pack, my nigga, that's why I pray
'Cause where I stay I got to carry my muthafuckin' gun every single day

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

The p-l-e-x is crowding all my space
'Bout to pop this motherfucker cause he standing in my place
He selling on my block, jacking from my boys
They coming on our side throwing down and talking noise
Now, I occupy my time hustling and getting paid
He occupying his time trying to get boys for they blades
Getting 'em for they Chevy 'Burbans, they jumping out of who doos
Coming down swinging, jumping out of candy blues talking 'bout give it up smooth
Baby boy, it's some hating going on in P.A
Mostly over stinky bitches and who sold the most yay
Niggas stunting, pulling pistols ending up in the grave
When I pull I always pop, that's why I'm living today
Girl-ass niggas causing plex between friends
And when you bust on your boy don't neither one of y'all niggas win
You end up killing somebody that you really ain't wanna kill
Over a pussy-ass nigga that's showing ho-type skills

Motherfuckers wanna start shit in every way
That's why I carry my motherfucking gun every single day

Coming from the small town of madness, late night its all murd'rers
Player haters, scan'lous hoes, and 'Lac-driving slab hurters
Acting bad after 8, you can catch us on the late
Rolling dice, blowing, and sipping on the bar straight
We got the red drank, orange drank, purple drank
Laughing at these mark hoes that say they never heard of drank
Half-gallon Big Gulp, Big Red, big cup
Drink mixed up, blowing sweets, and lighting sticks up
Now in my new world, slow down, I can see
Niggas talking shit, trying to see if what they said got to me
But ho-ass type of skills say a lot to me
You just gon' fuck around and get yourself shot, to be
Or not to be, motherfuckers plot to see me crack
Under pressure, so they just impress a nigga to see me react
These niggas try to stare me down like a scary clown
Don't dare me, 'round here we fuck your game up like Larry Brown
And carry pounds of killer 'round like groceries
With a presence that make you not want to stand close to me
Talking about we s'posed to be brothers
Don't make me laugh motherfuckers
You chose to be on the side opposing me
Don't matter what coast you be
From, Bun and C will light your world up explosively

Roll like a stone, like my name Mick Jagger

Run a drum machine like my name Roger Linn
Write the rhyme do the beat, the hook and the mix

Of a true and livin' Goddamn fool
I came to sweep you off yo Goddamn feet
Now pass that Sweet and get back
Lookin' for action, retaliation, and reaction
That's where that shit at
Click-clack, that's that pistol
Bullets cuttin' wind, make a fucked up ass whistle
You know it's yo' dismissal
Now this'll nip it in the bud
For my brothers in the pen
Every day I gots to bust two nuts nigga, what
I put it down, keep puttin' it down
So I advise hoes to not fuck around
This that Underground
Bitch you couldn't cut the sound
Would blow up, hold up
Wrong move, but it's time
To call the first family to handle these niggas
Because we are the worst
You bitch niggas laid yo' eyes on
I'm so fo' sure
That these G's goin' 4 fo' 4, and blow for blow
It's Silkk, Master P, and U.G.K
Front door, front row, slow it down ho, you know

Playaz from the South stack G's
Flippin' tight on that white
With that Candy on them gold D's

Flippin' tight on that white

Ready to bust on the nigga that talkin' shit
I'm bad, like Jason
Don't compare with them other niggas
'Cause I ain't freebasin'
Y'all niggas gone on that fried black
I had fucked mo' niggas in the game than a quarterback
I got them G's, them killers, them keys
I'm fuckin' doublin' them D's
I'm triplin' them T's
Tryin' to make this dope into quarter keys
Ask me where I'm from, New Orleans (New Orleans)
Where them niggas in the projects be ballin' (ballin')
Slangin' that Iceberg and Plirens
Runnin' from the sirens
Don't know how to comp
But work the fuck out a triple beam
Eliminate niggas like Calgon (Calgon)
If there was a motherfuckin' band I'd be a baritone
See the P is from that motherfuckin' Calliope (Calliope)
Where them niggas boot up and gold teeth
Don't give a fuck about a ho
And niggas stuntin' on that water (water)
You know we 'bout it, 'bout it
Don't give a fuck about seein' no motherfuckin' tomorrow
And won't stop, send me to the pen
I won't stop 'til them motherfuckin' Saints go marchin' in


1-2-3, you know Silkk a G (G)
All about that motherfuckin' mail (mail)
Gold on my ride, front, back, side-to-side
You know a nigga all about them sales
I don't fuck around with them niggas that front and stunt
Nigga ain't ask yo bitch ass to come
I'm from that Third Ward nigga (Uptown)

For them niggas that boast, I be like blast it
Watch the ground gets full of smoke
And watch y'all get ghost like Casper

Same spot, same Glock, cook more rock

Be on Down South Hustlers, I wasn't surprised

You'd have to bring four eighteen wheelers
Fill em' from back to front

But bitch I'm gettin' the bacon
And wood and candy just an every day thing rubbin' bud
Because she like the way that fifth wheel
And that grill look

Sipped syrup with murderers
Keepin' food in my mouth
In case you bitches ain't heard of us
Nigga, I live for the rush, I live for the crush
I'm down with Ricky Royal and the motherfuckin' Flush
Yeah, and the motherfuckin' Organized Noize boy, what's up


Now I got holla at Port Arthur
And all them motherfuckin' niggas in Texas
Know what I'm talkin' about

Just because it rhymes with Lexus

Like my syrup and swisha can't leave without it when I ride
Even though I'm the king of the city where I reside
I wouldn't and couldn't do it without my woman on my side
Sometimes I got it figured out, sometimes I'm confused
I win 9 times out of 10 but now and then I might lose
But no matter the road I choose and how the drama unfold
A playa always got his better half right on his shoulders
She gon' hold me down to the fullest, rainy or sunny
She seen me ball out of control and dead broke with no money
So when the game got funny, she ain't pack up and roll
She help me get back on my feet now man that's way too cold
If you got a down woman wit'chu keepin it true
Don't try to hate, appreciate her for the things that she do
This dedicated to the dedicated ladies that stand up
If you keep it real wit your man, then put your hand up, c'mon

I love the fact that you don't need me to make you whole
Doin it fast or takin it slow, you know when to let me take control
And I apologize for puttin tears inside them eyes
When I wasn't fair didn't compromise, put you in fear when I told them lies
How I love to dive inside them thighs, I love your cockiness
Ain't gonna ask if you roll in rap, you know this right it's obvious

I came to smoke a son of a bitch that went for his but didn't pull it
Fast enough and got blasted up with a bullet
I'm sniping, I got you in my scope so what's the use of trying to bail?
I'm ready to catch a case but not for yayo, for a murder, mayne

I close the deal from the front door
Fuck me right and suck me tight
And you just might hit the blunt ho
I don't stunt and blow smoke up your ass baby
But don't be acting all saditty with class baby
You with a nigga such as my self it'll cost you
So pay before a nigga fuck around and be the tosser

Sweet Jones, gripping grain
With all that shit you talk ain't got no bezatine chain
And most of y'all niggas ain't nothing but tricks
But we sipping lean and breaking bricks
Popping pills, work the wood wheel
Fuck where you're from and fuck how you feel
If you want to go to war I'll take you to war
I got an AK-47 and a TEC in the car

I got them bitches popping pussy getting buck
And you know that we couldn't give a fuck
I got them bitches on the corner selling cot
And the game that I got don't stop
I got them thug ass niggas with the syrup
And you know that we always blowing herb
And in the club man you know we stay strapped
And bitch you know that it ain't about this rap
Bitch niggas getting hit in the front
I give a fuck bitch you can hit the blunt
And everyday young boys that's paid
Lay it down when we chopping on the blades

I'm always trying to put in work, niggas wanna do my dirt
Balling down on Beale Street, sipping on a pint of syrup
Chopping up the chronic weed, picking all the fucking seeds
Trying to slow my roll, in my trunk, I got them fucking keys
Always riding Chevy things, shining on them twanky things
Kids, I'm a role model, Police, I'm a dope man
Can't forget to check my traps, got me cheese a player slap
People say that pimping dead, never has it left the map
Optimos, a fifth of crown red eyes with a frown
Niggas with them gold teeth, fast talking on the town
Some of us are under cover, make your baby mama love us
Knot in my right pocket, left pocket got them rubbers
Right hand Rolex watch, stuffed shirt, plastic Glock
Back pocket Chevy keys, ready for the brain wash
I'mma go pimp a bitch,I'mma like, wicked witch
Always learn to watch your friends, backstabbers cause a snitch

Now see let me blow your mind the real business in the wind
The main thing fucking up these hoes is their fucking friends
You remember back in day it was niggas pimping hoes
Take a look around now it be hoes pimping hoes
What the business what the deal man these hoes got me fucked
Make me walk up in the strip and kind of get like buck
Oh you fucking with my cheese oh you fucking with my paper
Bitch you got to pay the piper even if you straight rape her
I ain't mad about my girl licking pussy with a girl
Cause she got to get it done but that thing ain't my world
Bitch I'll tell you what your job and your job nonstop
I need the spectacles, testicles, wallet and watch
I need the coke keys, door keys, low keys, rover keys
On knees and Bentley's, mozzarella cheese
Now nigga now you talking hoes get to walking
And I ain't trying to hear that bullshit bitch walk (Bitch!)

"Pocket Full of Stones, Pt. 2",Super Tight...,1994.0,"36 ounces make 'em bounce in the street!
I don't wanna do it but a nigga gotta eat
I'm fresh outta jail so you know a nigga swole
Straight to Short Texas where the fucking dope is sold
Cocaine lady white lady selling good
Got them hoes on that bar in my motherfucking hood
Making all that paper fucking hoes in the sheets
Motherfucking fearless, smoking big fat Swisher Sweets

It's the return of the main motherfucker selling crack!
Time to give it away now, on the Short four years on my back
(?)They know me when they see me so they holler ""Big Bun!""
The nigga that don't give a fuck about the value of a dollar
Fiends go get (?) wave like I'm a star
Cause they know I've got the white girl and the black tar in my car
So when you see the nigga face you know it's on
I'm back in this bitch with another pocket full of fucking stones
Bitch!

I got a pocket full of stones
Got a pocket full of stones
I got a pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone

The law turn their backs on the street so they trip
Trying to catch me on the sharp while I'm slanging for my grip
So now I'm hitting licks, quick quiet as a mouse
Last quarters (?) damn its time to get a house
I found me a shack deep west by the bridge
And stored half a bird in the next town by Willow Ridge
And brought it back to P.A. right past the undercovers
Couldn't find my o-clip so I ask their lil brothers
They still wearing Dickies like they did when I left
Making moneys number one before life or death
And fucking hoes down Cause I been in that world
Coming up on these wannabes sporting Jheri Curls
So anything ya need whether weed, speed, cain
Heroin, ice, ecstasy ya find I got it made
How far to see ya peep, when you need ya very own
Bring ya mother or your brother
When ya'll need another pocket full of motherfucking stones
Bitch!

I got a pocket full of stones
Got a pocket full of stones
I got a pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone

I bought an old ass 50 dropped it down to the pavement
Every damn dime that I made I made a nigga save it (?)
I knew a nigga in the city with that case (?)
?
Making big stacks (?)
Got some hoes slanging sugar at the school for me fool
Selling big bundles of that Heroin with that E
No more ounces baby all I sell is forty keys
I got a house and a car but I stay outta sight
Ask DJ Bird I (?) chilling nigga (TIGHT)
Sharp as a (?)
I got some shit make an elephant buck (?)
So tell all them hoes you met Pimp C
A slow walking, country talking, weed smoking G
Cause I'ma show these hoes how she supposed to be
When you ain't a fucking nigga you can come inside with me (?)

I got a pocket full of stones
Got a pocket full of stones
I got a pocket full of stones
And they won't leave my ass alone

Shit is fucked up but I still pack that chrome
Motherfucking feds got a tap on my phone
But if they run their fucking ass up in my home
BUCK-BUCK-BUCK to they motherfucking dome
Cause like Bun said ""We ain't no punk ass tricks""
And tell  he can suck a nigga dick
Cause niggas tired of all that fuck ass shit
And if they leave it up to me they find em stanking in a ditch
Cause can't no gosh damn body stop crack
As long as young niggas making big fat stacks
I tried to do it legal making records (?) bent
Like 2Pac said ""it didn't pay the fucking rent""
So now I'm cooking (?) of that crack
A nigga doing bad so I had to sell my fucking (?)
I tried to get a job but they say that I'm too known
So I'm back on the streets with my niggas
With a motherfucking pocket full of stones

I got a pocket full of stones starting all over again",https://genius.com/Ugk-pocket-full-of-stones-pt-2-lyrics
Feds in Town,Super Tight...,1994.0,"A bad day for the niggas in my clique
I just got had a call from a bitch at the PA P.D. that's on my dick
It seems the drug situation is so to' up
In Po' town the fuckin DEA had to show up
I got shit sewed up so the 99 can’t hassle me
Now, they got the muthafuckin feds to come and wrestle me
And throw my game in a suplex
They got my 2 best workers on secret indictments now who’s next
Word on the streets is that they're rollin
Word on the streets is that they rollin
In Dynasties..I-ROCs…and Caravans and muthafuckas is FOLDIN
Like paper stacks in a rubberband
For an all out attack on your local crack slangin brothaman
And fiend servin is slow as fuck
Cause my niggas are nervous
And if they even think they see five-o, they duck!
So now, instead of rollin thick, niggas is Cappin with a frown
Cause, the motherfuckin feds in town

And now they got me runnin from the feds (6x)

Yes, the shit is silly, I put up my 9 milli for a switch-blade
I don't need no shit with these bitch-made
No more clownin in this town bro
No high-cappin in the clubs, I got to play them on a down-low
I took my thangs off my buick and y'all know I ain't love that
Rollin' on some white walls and hubcaps
And even though I got long nails
No more French manicures bitch, you got to do your own nails
I told my niggas to make sure that all their shit was tight
Cause they're gonna be on y'all ass every day and night
Tryin to run all kind of game
So, put y'all motherfuckin cars and yall cribs in yall momma's name
I took my jewelry to the pawn shop and sold it
Brought the money to my baby's momma and I told her to hold it
Cause Lil Bun might not see Big Bun up in his face
If I catch a fuckin case -- when the feds in town


God damn, it's been two motherfuckin months
Since I took my Rolex from under my sleeve
These hoes act like they ain't go never leave!
That shit is funky like a black skunk
Fuck all this waitin man, it's time to get this motherfucker back crunk!
I let them motherfuckers slack up, reorganize my clique
Got two birds and opened my lab back up
And told my boys, ""If a nigga looks crazy, blasts his ass in the eye
Don't give him a chance to identify!""
And show his badge, I'm sorry to inform you
If your girl is pregnant, you ain't gon live to see your child be born
I'm blastin laws at rofom, cause I believe it's time to hand them
Slugs to the dome man God Damn em
I'm sick of hiding like a bitch in the closet
So, y'all hoes can't find me
Y'all better try to blind me
And remind me of the jail time
Cause in my yard is a big ass I got Yayo sign
It's time for Tony Montana stacks
I got niggas on the corner holdin big ass coffee cans and crack
Filling up Texas with that rock up
So, if y'all thinkin about checkin
My fool come running with your Glock up
Cause, I'm a blast my nine to my last clip
To my last slug
Before you take me for my damn drugs
So, we can have it all night, fight
Cause bitch, I'm ready to die from my tight white

Pimpin’ Ain’t No Illusion,Dirty Money,2001.0,"One time for yo' muthafuckin back bitch
Kool Ace, UGK

Pimpin' ain't no illusion
And pimpin' ain't never died
Mo' pimps was on that heroin
And yo' pimp tripped out on that fry
The dikes done came through
And straight threw off all the game;
Got all these hoes thinkin'
They could manage they own change

But it ain't no illusion
I know you all have witnessed
He rollin' in my Caddy mo'
Wit' fly bitches
Makin' ole deals: Now, ho
Ain't Bob Barker
But I'm caught up in this game
More like Peter Parker
P-I-M-P, take the P's that I am
I want you payin' hoes in my army
Like Uncle Sam
And we gon' jam
I'm talkin' 'bout the world greatest show
I know my shit is extreme
But I'm all about them does
When I'm steppin' on the scene
Be there four deep, hella clean
My reality is your favorite dream
(Stop that shit, daddy)
Best believe Kool Ace gon' keep it real
Pimp C & Bun B to testify for the ear
Excuse me, y'all, but this about Southern shit
Now, tell me can you uh, feel this, bitch?
We givin' 'em brain contusions
Pimp C, what's the conclusion?

(How the fuck you know Sweet Jones?)
My hoes still out there sellin' ass
Yo' bitch is out of pocket
Cause yo' pimpin' was scary;
Real hoes gon' front on a simp
But she gon' do it for daddy
Fuck niggas watch The Mack and try to pimp on my floozie;
But, boy, my bitches know the difference
Between real pimpin' and movies
It's the difference between real leather
And that shit at yo' house
I don't know what y'all doin' up there
But we really pimpin' in the South
Every since I was 17
I been stackin' my green
Went for servin' rocks to fiends
And rockin' club full a teens
Went from bumpin' Screw in Houston
Sippin' promythazine
To ridin' in a 8 600 with sheath
To smokin' on sticky green
I'm still Pimp C, bitch
I'm claimin' P.A., they hate us;
But, me and Kool Ace rollin' a Lexus
Sittin' on all gold Daytons
Bitch, take a look around
Those hoes steady choosin'

If you got any love fo' that broad you wit'
Nigga, move her 'fore you lose her

Third leg is a bitch abuser, infamous
In cities where big pimpin' is my hoes clean
No AIDS, herpies, cyphillis
Come catch a whiff of this
Damn, can't you taste it?
Now yo' money's up in smoke
Like you freebased it
Now bitch replaced it
Wit' a sexual favor
But don't get mad at real pimpin', nigga
Check yo' behavior and savor
The aroma from Promona to Tacoma;
Got my pimpin' diploma for bein' a Cadillac chromer
Fuck a Sonoma
I'm on a mission for Benzes
Knowin' 'xactly where my ends is, ballin' relentless
And then my friends is
Slappin' niggas with glass chins
It's funny sendin' tricks home
Broke and defenseless; and, ever since this
Boy been pimpin' the pen
I promise never to ever leave home
Without my pimpin' again that's why

You know, I got to tell you players what I'm talkin' about
My bitch got bold opened a bank account
When I found the bitch checkbook
I didn't get mad
Cause there was no doubt that I be gettin' the cash
I broke it down to her
She gave me the dough
Do you remember what you was
Before I made you a ho?
You was a broke bitch
You couldn't even smoke shit
Couldn't stay fo-cused
And, don't forget it, bitch
Yo' whole life changed the day you met me
Now you think you need a bank account
Baby, I can't see
You managin' this money, it's too much
All you do is look good
And then you fuck
Git my money, git yo' money
It's all the same
The shit ain't even funny when you talk about this game
They call me Too $hort, baby
I'm still in it
Ain't no camouflage, nuttin' but this real pimpin', bitch

Just big fat balls and a trigga in they backpack

But I bet you hear me when I fill you with bulletholes

Money tight Glock, bustin them shots
When I break yo ass off somethin hot
Niggas steady catchin lead to the head, I never aim for the chest
Muthafuckas sportin bulletproof vests
So I guess, when I start blastin, niggas start passin away
Dearly beloved, I had yo ass gathered today
So I can lay you hoes in a line, draw you to a square
Put them hands on yo ass, and bail on out
Pass the pen, Pimp C and Bird, I take the blunt
Now surprise, surprise
I'm gettin chinese eyes
In this bitch here's a switch
I might slang, bang then bail and burn
Scope mean now its the return of the trill ass niggas",https://genius.com/Ugk-return-lyrics

By no fault of they own, goin through struggles and strife
Havin to deal with a fucked up life (that's cold)
I know they thinkin nobody knows, or nobody cares
Why can't nobody see the shit, when everybody stares
Man we losin the children, we losin the youth
Cause you motherfuckers won't tell 'em the truth
So they runnin 'round unprepared, and uninformed
It's understood that's why the hood is dumpin on 'em
We gotta show 'em it's a better way (F'REAL) at any cost

I'm playin in the candy torture rim with TV's like my Roy

I'm wonderin if it's a heaven for MC's
Like the Freaky Tah's, the Big L's and B.I.G.'s

I wonder if they got a heaven for the convicts
Niggas doin life, I saw old men in that bitch

I wish today that the Lord take me away
I'd get to see my old man and I wonder what he would say

I feel that, I miss Monroe too
If I could bring him back I'd give up all this shit fool

Dirty Money,Dirty Money,2001.0,"Say, look here man I'm a rapper
Hold up, let me take that back
I make rap music, but that don't mean all a nigga do is rap
But that don't matter I've been labeled, stigmatized, stereotyped
There's an entertainment disease worse than cancer
A venereal type
I spit imperial-type game like Digga from the Sqaud
But they act like they can't separate a real nigga from the fraud
Rule number one: never send a boy to fuck a grown ass lady
And respect the game cause the game is known to be
Gone fast baby
Now It's a long pass maybe you should try diving for it
Fools act like they striving for it hit Total Request Live and blow it
Knowing ain't a giving and nothing is
See all this candy-coated and bluffing is detrimental to our beautiful black southern kids
Enough of this man, let's get this here straight like creases
It's a never-ending cycle and motion that never ceases
It's compresses and releases and for the love of Jesus
It's breaks the soul, now we forever left to pick up the pieces it's dirty money

Niggas laughing but ain't a damn thing funny
You gotta have paper in this land of milk and honey
Yeah, it's bright outside but not nessicarily sunny
And no matter how you make it, it's all dirty money baby

Every drug I sold was for the dirty money
Most of my niggas is dead because the game is funny
You could get your life took at the drop of the dime
But I'mma pimp till the end and keep my money on mind
Most of my life I've been broke trying to save my bread
I never ask to be hustling now I watch out for feds
Cause niggas be talking and giving up game
About the cheese, the green, the pills, the coke D's
I married my pockets, so now I chase my green
Keep a thang for the haters with the red beam
Every since fifteen I've been a big money fiend
Sippin' cold codeine and pulling up clean
Popping up at the spot and dropping the top
And keep a bad yellow 'bop with my dick on rock uh!


You can't get no house, no car
No weed, no bar, no flash, no show
No class, no flow, no help, no love
No liquor, no drug, no clique, no crew
No tracks to flow to, no pager, no phone
No flavor, no zone, no fiend, no cut
No wife, no slut, no name
Nowhere in the game to get me five
No nothing without that dirty ass M-O-N-E-Y


My momma taught me what the value of a dollar should be
But everybody I saw balling was rolling selling Keys
In the late 80's niggas pulling up on D's
Putting dick up in these hoes and making 'em pay fees
Learn how to ride dirty cause ain't shit for free
Then all them niggas got popped that's all I needed to see
For some the dope game cool cause that's all that they could be
I know God ain't put me down here just to be serving no fiends
I know God ain't put me down here just to be serving no fiends",https://genius.com/Ugk-dirty-money-lyrics

Nigga fiendin' but steady holdin' wit' a tight hold
No more crack but steady pullin' wit' a tight pull
All fucked up and eyes redder than a red bull
Look at that, I bet she don't know where her kids at
Used to be all that, now she's dating Mr. Crack
Had her first when she was 13 now he's 11 years
And he standin on Texas, sellin' rocks and drinkin' beers
She got another girl, she's 8, stayed with her aunt and uncle
But uncle's sick, cause every night she's suckin' on
Her uncle's dick, who can she tell? Nobody gives a fuck
She tells anybody she fucks him she'll get fucked up
So the shit keeps goin' on for another six
14 and now she's tired of suckin' uncle's dick
Got a .38 from her girlfriend in school
Went home, loaded it up and cold smoked the fool
Cause he's a

Lord, lord, lord
Lord, lord, lord
Lord, lord, lord

I live in every city, I stand on every block
I'm beggin' from everybody so I could smoke any and every rock
You see I'm homeless, I'm broke, I stink
I got some fucked up teeth and I'm a thief so I gank
For them kids lunch money, a child I would choke
And clothesline your granny for some change so I could take a toke
You see I'm not in my right mind
So I'm hopin' that I can get some dope in my system by night time
So to make a lil' cash, I might wipe me a windshield or pump gas
Or take your purse and dash
Try'na to make a deal witcha, huh
But if I can't get a dime for 6, fool I'm 'bout to get cha
Don't fuck up and let me taste it
Cause I'mma chip your shit, take my lil' piece and freebase it
I ain't nothin' but a clucker, your typical glass dick sucker
Basehead, geekin' motherfucker
Just call me a...


And I'm still rollin' a fattie but I'm dippin' it into that water
And makin' me a wet daddy, the green monster
Tameka be tellin' me not to do it
But everyday I find myself full of that fuckin' embalming fluid
Yeah, so you can certify me as a fiend
And if you smoke dip fool you know what I mean
Now let me lean to the motherfuckin' left
Start walkin' fast and get my blast by my goddamn self
That's how it goes, movin' slow in the south
A stone cold junkee with some drugs in his mouth
High till I die, and fry is all I taste
Don't make me catch a case by pumpin' them slugs in your face
I'm at the geekin' stage so you better not trust me
And I'll still buck you down, motherfucker if you fuck me
So close the top of the toilet cause it's finna get funky
I'm smokin' like a fiend cause I'm a stone cold junkee",https://genius.com/Ugk-stoned-junkee-lyrics

See I ain't never gave no chick four stars
But the dugout is so good that she be drivin my cars
And everyday it get better, I can't lie

All my friends be sayin, ""She ain't nothin but a trick""
But the girl got a PhD, in suckin dick
So I, let her suck and I give her them ducats
I'm a special kind of fool and I know it, but aiyyo fuck it!

Fuck my dome, I just can't leave the bitch alone
So every time she ask me for my, credit card
You know she get it cause ya know that my, dick on hard

So I'm passin out them ducats in them Kroger sacks
And everybody wonderin why I smile all day
All the girls wanna know why I don't give 'em the play
My ol' girl called me, asked me why I'm trippin and shit
I said, ""Cause yo' pussy ain't better than my new bitch""
I can't get enough, the bad got me stuck
I give her all my money and she give me right to nut and

Bitch don't never get no rest

Uh...Grippin' the five, 
I'm a pimp in my mind

My bottom bitch got some goals, with a good credit line
So, we pop the plastic..
If she hustle, I ball
Long as she payin' daddy
Ain't no problems at all
So, we break the mall
Now and then we fuck;
And then the bitch gon' be cool
Long as the paper stay up
When she suck on my pipe
Them golds shiny and bright..
Got them lames hittin' that service every fuckin' night
I'm tal'in' 'bout NBA tricks
NFL tricks
NHL tricks
Payin' my bitch
Grade A pussy and she payin' for my dick;
She on my two-way now
The bitch done hit a fat lick, a fat lick
Chorus: (Bun B)
Now tell me what it's all about in that South:
Big gold grill in yo mouth
With leather inside your car, on yo' back, in yo' house
Get in a nigga's ride, the seat feel like a couch
Big cheese in my pouch
Bitch, if it hurt, say ""Ouch""
Chorus: (Pimp C)
Show ya grill if you will, show ya grill if you will
Show ya grill if you will, and you down with the trill
Show ya golds if ya bold, show ya golds if ya bold
Show ya golds if ya bold, and ya diamonds is cold

See this one right here, my niggas
We gon' dedicate it
To them boys from the ghetto keepin' grills gold-plated
Never hated, never will
We stayin' forever trill;
But boys on the blocks
They keep comin' forever grilled
Open face with them designs...shit
Maybe a rack on top and bottom with a couple of diamonds to add some shine
Some niggas got that yella gold
Some niggas got that white
Some niggas got that platinum and bling, bling 'em all night
Shit, I know this boy with one gold, no ice;
I know a nigga who got robbed and bought the same teeth twice;
Muthafuckas with fangs, symbols of gangs or they squad
Some real and some fraud;
Spell the name of they broad
Got boys that praise the Lord
With open face and they cross
Some did all thirty-two, and paid a heavy-ass cost
So, whether you the boss, the runner, or the square
C'mon down to the South;
We got gold grills everywhere
Chorus

Gold in the middle, they stay shiny
One on each canine;
You get one free if you not paid on government aid
Go get some shades
You blindin' hoes with 14 carat sun rays
But while they all up in yo grill
They vision blurry for days
Stacked, and ya say, ""But couldn't I just stop at one"" just like Lays
You left the whole jaw twinkle, to stick a rag in ya face
You buff 'em and shit;
They sparkle like the comets in space
I got two crosses with a diamond, heart, a club, and a spade

White ice on gold; that's what we be flippin' dog
3rd Ward to The Mound
You know that we keep it raw
8Ball on my grill, baby, love it when I smile;
Say it make her pussy wet
And make her nipples get all hard
I try to break myself from the same ol' pattern
In the boulevards scattered, full a hatin': nigga chatterin'
Hoes, if you ask me, ""What them niggas be about?""
Hate me cause my flow official

Pregnant for who?

You ain't pregnant for me, I ain't make no motherfucking baby
(Sorry nickel and dime ass funky nigga)
I don't give a fuck, making babies for them niggas that make love, I fuck, I don't make no babies
(Bitch you don't know the meaning of fucking ho')
I must know the meaning of something, you come around her talking about you a baby for me, well I got something for your motherfucking ass, it ain't mine
(Yeah, you gone take care of your responsibilities trick)
Man, motherfuck me and them responsibilities, you better go to the welfare line with that bullshit
(Welfare? You got me fucked up)
Man, look here you better get out of my motherfucking face because I ain't claiming nan little motherfucking baby, so you can go on with that shit

Now all you ho's listen up to what I'm saying
Regardless of the consequences Bun B ain't paying
You're laying in my bed and dead center's what I'm looking fo'
Let me get this nut and you can get your ass to booking ho'
Don't cook no breakfast and don't cook me no lunch
You ain't nothing but another little banana in the bunch
Catch the metro home or you can walk like a bum bitch
You ain't worth a John, break this rock and catch a crumb
Yeah I nutted in you bitch, you got a problem with it?
See I left some on the bed too, you can go and get it
This bitch is tryna game on a trill ain't it funny
You know them trill ass niggas ain't bout giving up no money
I see you starting to get a little belly on you bitch
You two months swolle with that old seven month bitch
I hope your nigga ready for the bills he bout to get
Best not send no papers my way ho' cuz I ain't paying shit
If anybody ask me bitch, I ain't even done it
Rather feed a feign a crumb and punch yo ass in the stomach
Cuz from my point of view get your ass out my face
Next time around tryna catch a fucking rape case
Cuz if it's mine or not, you can raise up off my dick
Better sign up for some food stamps, welfare or the WIG
Cuz child support I can do without
Here's a fork and butter knife, cut it up and shit it out
The motherfucker ain't mine

I ain't claiming shit
That's what I said
She said the lucky man is you
Get off my dick
I ain't claiming shit

Fuck around with Pimp C and get your fucking neck broke
Ho' gave me the pussy, now she claim I shot sperm
But they all know I keep a hood on my fucking worm
Bitch had a mind to try to catch me in a rape case
Caught her ass slipping shot three shots in her fucking face
Cuz I ain't the one, ain't the two or the three
So how the motherfuck is you gone fade Pimp C
Gotta get a grip ho' or better get a clutch
Before they find your ass walking round here with a crutch
Cuz I'm a trill nigga, so you fucked the real shit
I kick ya in your stomach and leave you naked in a ditch
All heard of J, dirty and magic
So get your tail up and get the crawfish out your ass
Talking bout you got a baby growing in your sack
But I ain't bout to claim her now, fucking shaving yak
You want to have a baby cuz you think that I'm rich
But like that other ho' you better take your ass to Beaumont bitch
Cuz bitch I don't think you want to push me
I throw you on the floor and shove a hanger in your pussy
Come to think about it bitch, what you talking bout?
Can't be from me because I nutted in your mouth
Girl you must have lost your fucking mind
Cuz I know that the ugly motherfucker ain't mine

I ain't claiming shit
That's what I said

Get off my dick

Now hoes be getting anxious to get a niggas cash
Just give up some pussy and you thinking that my money Imma pass
Kiss my ass bitch, It ain't gone work
Tryna have a baby for me ho' I ain't no fucking jerk
Gonna get your ass hurt fucking around with the trill
You must not know the deal
Me claim a baby? How the fuck you feel?
No bitch, no way, no how, ain't no happenings
If I claimed it, your trifling ass would be out high capping
Bitch I wouldn't give your ass the pleasure or the pain
Me and my nigga's ran a train so why you pointing my way?
Ho' I was second out of six
And that's too many dicks for your trifling ass to try and make a bit
Bitch you better start with the first
Then skip to the third cuz that little Bun B shit is absurd
But see now I done heard it all befo'
But keep that bullshit up and you gone make me get some shit on my toe
Ho' I ain't with it so you best go home
Before you fuck around and get your little trifling ass rolled on
Have a baby for me, how you figure?
I love pregnant pussy, but only when it's for another nigga
But see now that trigga ain't no punk
So bail before they find you and a cut up baby dead in my trunk
Don't make me chuck your ass in a ditch
You talking all you want, but see the motherfucker ain't mine bitch

And tell the hoes to get this dick
Now punks be lookin at my boys on the block
They scopin' the corner, motherfuckers I warn you
Too many niggas tried to get these fiends
You brothers better cut some fuckin' hubbaz on this scene
Cause cluckers don't go for small dope
You fin' to lose when dope fiends cut ya fuckin throat
You see my shit is legit, so it's on
Cut a fifty cent slab and tell that bitch to get gone
Because my face don't need to be on the street
See I put out my dope, get my cash, then I'm tearin' ass
I'm in and out quick as day
Might drop a hundred or two, but I won't miss it anyway
Because as long as the majority of shit gets fat
I'm cool to give myself a little slack
See I've been doin this too damn long
To short my slang, and makin all them pay for dem thangs
I got a thirty-five square block cut
Down to take your money, dope, your ho and your nut

You claim you got much dope, and you got much backup
But you ain't got JACK SHIT to make this nigga slack up
So if you wanna buck buck up bitch and let me black that eye
Ho you fin' to kiss them teeth goodbye
Now if you're down act like it bitch
Step in that grass, I'm fin' to put them hands on yo' bitch ass
And buffin ain't a good ass plan
You get smacked the fuck up, now un-ball them fuckin' hands
You see you need to be true to yourself
Cause if you'll front, your ass'll be on my shelf
And trill ass niggas they love to blast
But if we ain't got the gat, we'll also choke yo' motherfuckin ass
And you ain't never been shit to your hood
Your ass shoulda listened when I told you ""Something Good""
But right about now I ain't sayin a damn thang
If you wanna do it then step your ass to the ring
And bring on your boys, I'm takin ALL you hoes one by one
Hands flyin like bullets from a gun
I'm steady whoopin' that ass ho
Nigga by nigga out the window, you better watch that glass ho
Stepped to Bun B, and you thought I was a punk
Now you bitch-asses half dead in my trunk
You fronted big man and then went out like a ho
Nigga kiss that motherfuckin flo', cause I'm a trill ass nigga

I'm just a trill ass nigga walkin down the street
It's Bun B bitch, the nigga you and your girlfriends wanna meet
My nuts hang to the road
So buck up and get fucked up by the Big Tyme mother load
You better watch that ass when you roll
Ease up on U.G.K. you gotta pay the fuckin toll
And we ain't hearin' that ying-yang
You keep on runnin that lip and watch yo' ass get slanged
Yeah Bun B'll talk shit
But if you think I can't back it up niggas, try and make a fuckin hit
Pimp C'll slam you to the peel
You're layin' on the ground, ayo Burt, kick him and his fuckin' reel
The U.G.K. posse they mighty fool coon
And we down to let the gat go boom
So call 9-1-1, and let the law scoop yo' punk ass up
Before we make you niggas shit in your drawers
The life of the trill niggas ain't no joke
Cause we down to go for motherfuckin broke
So watch out for the niggas in the khakis
The U.G.K. posse backs me, so don't jack G
Because the dicks hang low, to any two-bit ho
And I'm about to get some shit on my toes
And I'ma keep on doin it Clyde

I brought the new style in and the bass it got crunker
I bought me a slab and now I'm a pop trunker
Do I wanna rap or swang on 4's
Your brother's comin down slammin Cadillac do's
People tellin me that it's just my time
They know it's UGK for life and I get down for mine
14 on the mic and you never seen me play
Big Dick Cheney comin straight up outta P.A

Been a legend since 1993
Gimme thirty thousand and I'll serve ya some heat
I'll write your rhymes, sang the hook, and I'll make ya a beat
I used to dream about this shit, now my money is legit

Don't you hate when broke niggas be on yo' dick~?!
I can make a lot of money, I know I can

Lot of cash in my pockets just to show my friends
I can put it in the bank to buy fo' mo' rims

Now my freedom is to me my main asset
So I'mma keep it 100, and give like I get
Chill at the ponderosa and smoke that good
I'm tryin to get rich while I rep for the hood
See everybody's got that same old dream
Of big cars, bad bitches and a mountain of cream
Drive a brand new Bentley, Benzo or a Beem
But ain't none of that worth tellin on yo' team
It's on you homeboy, so what'chu gon' do
You need to take my advice and stop snitchin fool
Or you can close yo' ears, and run yo' mouth

Candy,Underground Kingz,2007.0,"Now my candy, is 
so fresh so clean
I break them boys off when I pull up on the scene
In my candy, with ten coats sprayed tight
And that Northside royal blue is settin off the white
On my candy, 
sho' ain't the average paint
You go to Ike tryin to buy it he gon't tell ya ya cain't
Have my candy, it's like a one-of-a-kind
And you might have a painted slab but it ain't pretty as mine
Cause my candy, worth mo' than money can buy
Brought it to Funkmaster Flex and seen a grown man cry
For my candy, sittin on nuttin but glass
Stoppin traffic on the freeway, when I fly past
In my candy, got no competition on the street
You can win a Dub car show and still can't compete
With my candy, cause it's the sweetest on the block
And I'm trill, workin the wheel, that's why they all jockin
My candy~!

Candy, painted, drop top, El Do', riiiide
{*""Break the boys on the ave cause the slab's so tight""*}

Now my candy, is sittin tall on them Vogues
It's like an alarm clock, wakin up all the hoes
My candy, is wetter than high tide
And it's lookin like I just had a blizzard inside
Of my candy, got mo' wood in it than a forest
One look'll get you hooked like a motherfuckin chorus
My candy, drips an unerasable stain
It's real magic, not like that motherfucker David Blaine
My candy, it got the woman on the front
And a Ph.D in showin niggas how to stunt
My candy, it got the fifth up on the back
And it'll swang through your hood like it don't know how to act
My candy, the 8th wonder of the world
Like floatin downstream when you're starin at the swirls
My candy, ridin real trill, stayin true
And it's a legend in H-Town like DJ Screw
My candy

Just like candy, it's so sweet
Fadin niggas, on these streets
People watch as I ride by
In my candy, I'm gon' shine

Now my candy, is so smooth, so laid
And these boys can't comprehend how the paint got sprayed
My candy, makin people stop drop and stare
Pull out any car you want to but it won't compare
To my candy, it's like a fo' wheel mirage
That's too pretty to park, in a motherfuckin garage
My candy, it's like a part of the fam'
So lose my friends or my ends I wouldn't give a damn
But my candy, is an extension of me
So when you lookin at my car you lookin at Bun B
It's my candy, player, throwed, fly
And you can't fuck with it no matter how hard you try
My candy, the other level of the game
If you ask me again, bitch I'mma tell you the same
It's my candy, yeah nigga mines not yearns
Long as I got syrup to sip, and Swishers to burn
In my candy

Pussy got Me Dizzy,Super Tight...,1994.0,"Got me dizzy
Pussy got me (Dizzy)
Pussy got me (Dizzy)

I got some high school pussy and you know it's the lick
'Cause every day after school, she be ridin' my dick
She come over to my house, and my dick is 
I was in love like a muhfucka lickin' the pearl tongue
She always come over with a new bag of tricks
She got titties like  and a booty that's thick
The pizzy is so easy that my tizzy's dizzy to know
But I can't get crizzy about no busy sprung-ass ho
I got another  added to a freak and shit
She work at the post office and she work for my dick
Back in the day she kicked me down when I was livin' poor
I used to skip school and fuck her on the bedroom floor
Everything was cool
Cause her husband was the principal at the local high school
I got the loot, took the kids to the park
And in return I got good hot pussy after dark

Pussy got me (Dizzy)
Pussy got me (Dizzy)

Yeah, my nigga's at a show at motherfuckin' D-Town
And after we rock we holler at hoes that wanted to be down
Rest of my niggas walk off with they own pussy
And me and  tryin' to make clean clits mushy
We hollered at some  we saw 'em sittin' in a threesome
I said ""I wanna see some, pussy let's have some Bun B fun
Which way you do hoes wanna be wound up
The tricks, I wanna stick and fuck""
She said ""I ain't givin' up the pussy, even boy you gots to lick and suck"" (Biotch!)
I said ""What's up? Can I bend you over?""
She said ""I'm sassy but I ain't Lassie so don't  rover""
But I talked her to goin' up to the hotel
Make this little ho smell
My dick and she would say I fucked her so well
I sent her home and called her back and it was on again
Broke her back in her bed that I boned her in
See on the tool, I had this li'l ho skippin' school
To ride on my dick too, had to be trippin' fool
One day I fucked her without a bath, she went to her J.O.B
Came back with that stank, tryin' to lay on me
When I was takin' it on top I couldn't smell it
But from the back I had to inhale it and I could tell it
Wasn't clean. I told her ""Hold up, I can't cope
You oughta  with some Scope, don't bother, get you some soap
So wash your back with a 
But don't push in the bush 'til she dush' cause the puss'll make you dizzy""

Pussy got me (Dizzy)
Pussy got me (Dizzy)

I want a white biotch, a blue-eyed devil
So I can put her stanky ass on that other level
Let her legs open, I'ma start strokin' gladly
I don't know about you but 3-2 beats the pussy badly
But see it gets kinda scary 
When I place my dick in that asshole area
In and out, I work it all over
Put it in her mouth and try to tear her fuckin' tonsils out
Cause  be up and I'm strong
Pressin' down on that pussy, tryin' to break that pelvic bone
See  my dick is like a piece of crack
It keep 'em comin' back and they love it when I hit it from the back
So ho bend over and touch your toes
That's the way I like to do you 
And after I finish holler ""3-2 thank ya""
Cause all real G niggas know, the bitches love the gangsta
But still, givin' it with the niggas on the avenue
And every day,  is known to flip at least a bitch or two
But you know, they know, one them hoes gon' kiss me
Cause that stanky pussy be havin' me dizzy

But I think this right here is about to shut dem damn haters down!!

I'm from the streets that make niggas walk slow talk low
With white chalk-o, mi casa be siete uno ocho
Brooklyn motherfucker, handle this
Pardon my Spanish and French (Brooklyn baby!)
Okay, I stay clever like Mayweather with lay leather
'Til your face sever, one of the greatest ever
Beyond ringing bells, my name's so demanding
Shit, I got the swagger that'll leave Dakota Fanning
(That boy still standing!)
I hope you niggas over standing; I stay sucker-free
The next Kane up in the game, you ain't got enough to be
Your career last a week, that'll be luckily
Fuck wit me, the rap game'll need protective custody
(AHH!) I'm the same thug to be, surrounded with women
Gave the game True Religion before you found it in denim
Feel the Wrath of Kane and you cannot escape
The hip-hop version of The Ring
And you just watched the tape
(Next up!)

And keep your eyes on the niggas in noir
Triple black in the candy painted car is the color of war
Me and my brother on par with nann nigga
We trill workin the wheel, understand nigga? (Understand?)
I smother and split a bitch down to the tendon
High pressure, if you don't break your ass bendin
I'm way past endin in my series of warnin
You flex with me tonight playa you dead by the mornin (Woo!)
Bun Beater the best ever breathin or deceased
From the South to Midwest, Cali to the East
Got to any city nigga and bring my name up (all of em!)
I bet I eat the best rapper they got in the game up
Call a nigga up, email him or chirp him
Make a meal out his motherfuckin ass and then burp him
(DAYUM!) Don't fuck around I'm not your lil' homey
I'm the king of the underground so act like you know me
(Next up!)

Feel me, homie, we big steppin, big reppin
We givin kids Smith & Wesson lessons, you get left with a sketchin
Left with the Midwest, clique Texans (who dat?)
G. and Daddy Kane, the click Texas (word)
Pop you to death
I put private planes on swift Jetsons, niggas know what it is
When you see the ball cap and a slick Thessons (woo!)
Til you strip vexing to a movie clip from the Westerns
Shit from the Uzi clip lift up your midsection (Tell em G. Rap)
He will introduce you to the nose on the Glock fam
Give you metal jackets like clothes from a rock band
Multiple holes, you get those on your top, man (oww!)
High roller dose some hoes on the cock plan
Froze but never coldly rolls with a hot hand
We stackin cheese til the rubberbands pop scrams
And I ain't breakdancin when I'm in the pop stance
Bank pounds like James Brown give 'em hot pants

I make your gurl get down and open it up
Put my dick up in they jaws and go in they butt
I'm a young hot street flame (flame)
They call me Sweet James
Or call me Sir Jones, two hundred dollar cologne
(Uh!) Bond 9, or Issey Miyaki
I got your gurl mine, meat strong like saki
I ain't Rocky but I keep a rocket
Fuck around I'll knock your tuna fish out of socket
Your bitch out of pocket, she under pimpery
She reckless eyeballin watchin my top fall in
On my Lambourghini with the three screens
Fettucini, linguini, shrimp and a bowl of lean!

Nigga your piece big but your diamond look monkey

Everybody rappin like they ballin' and they rich
I see em' in the streets, I ain't believing that shit
They diamonds ain't shining, and they Rolex ain't real
While I'm gripping on this grain, sippin' lean and poppin' pills
Fuck how them bitches feel, I'm working wood wheel
In a 2000 Seville your stepdaddy can get killed
If he keeps talking shit, ain't no thang to get hit
On your video you trill, on your record you trying to diss
But everywhere we go, we represent the south
For Them niggas and Them girls with them golds in they mouth
Them boys with them P's and O's in they house
It's all about the trill bitch you ain't what this about...about...about

Disapprove we can get ya and your bullshit, I be the same
The game will never be the same, It was made for me to gain
You see the thangs for me to name I go by, so fly, oh my, flow sly
Wait awhile you know why (Why?) too many niggas pop collars and drop dollars
Baby ballin' bullshitter frontin' like rottweiliers
No bark, no bite, but showing fangs
Talking loud like they knowing thangs
I'm from Texas nigga, all we do is blow them thangs
Fuck your clique, your corner, your city, your last name
Stuck in the fast lane, look, I'll get your your ass, mane
Bask at the light, blast at the day, blast at the night
Got your ass in a fight

Waiting for me to fall, but Gipp ain't comin' off the wall
Till I'm ready keep that gun steady and ready
For anybody crossing the line with that fuck shit
I got a stack and got a ho, got a trunk with the funk
Got the radio on pump when I come through a slump
Remember me? The one that had your back up in the club?
Remember me? The one that bring you on and show you love?
Remember me? The one that rolled by deep in a cadillina
With a rusty ass niner looking for trouble

Yeah so what? I go the same places you go
I got the mark in my skin so you know my set

Well hold up, look how baby just rolled up
Coogi jeans on with the backside swoll up
She make playa straight slow up
Say man this girl is a dime from head to toe and from the flo' up
She make a drank-head not even wanna pour up
Take his al money to the mall and buy the sto' up
Never a flaw when she show up
These other broads hatin on her, if they sick they need to throw up
She got class and panache with precision
Picture perfect in my vision and I done made a decision
That I'm tired of wishin, get down with the Bun and Pimp and
You could roll with the playas on the million dollar mission, c'mon


Uhh, hey mama, I'mma tell you what the deal is
I like your style, I like how you handle your business
You ain't out here trippin chasin boys in showbiz
You're confident, you out here puttin it down for yo' kids
I don't care 'bout no nigga, he don't concern me
He ain't teachin you nothin, you need to learn me
Check out my mind, I'm 24 on the grind
I got the key to the streets, I got a open line
And I don't get caught up in ""he say, she say""
And I don't chase the cat, I keep the P play
I wouldn't holla if I ain't thought you was ready boo
I know you feelin me, cause girl I'm feelin you


Ooh baby (ooh baby)
Ooh baby (oh baby)
Give it up, give it up, give it up, give it up now

Yeah she a bad mamma-jamma, a brick, house
Still I fits, out, cause she thick, stout
With the feminine fat, in all the right places
She look me in my eyes and she make all the right faces
Cause she's a real catch, we make a tough pair
A true dynamic duo and we up there
We sittin tall at the top
And if she ride or die for me playa I'mma give her all that I got
I break her off and not, let her hold the keys
I don't take her out of town, man I take her overseas
It ain't trickin if you spend it on your lady
Bring the bacon home to baby and everything'll be gravy
Just let me know if that's soundin like a plan
Cause all you really need to change your life is the man
And you appealin to the King of the Trill and
I just wanna know if you're feelin me like I'm feelin, you

Nigga, you're a lame you ain't holding like Sweet James
They choosin' (??) on my phone, call me Sir Jones

20's on the car, keep a pint of barre
Gripping on the wood, playing Above The Law
Hustlas, ballers, selling boys cane
Fuck y'all pussy niggas too, it's whatever y'all wanna do....do

Dollars, we foldin' na, slab, we rollin' na, bitches we controllin' na
Man, I'm Holdin na (Repeat 4x)

Man, I break the scene, way before I became a teen
Crushing boys on the boulevard from summer to spring
Music orientated, so when the rap game originated
I fit it like puzzle pieces, niggas couldn't fade it
I made it to a level that other players only dream
Brought heat to the scene, make the women on me cream
And my money went from green to poppin' chrome
Plus I Got my self a yellow jazzy bopper to bone
Got the home and the cars, got the plaques and the stacks
But mane back in the days, it wasn't nothing like that
Shit, I remember when at first they wasn't really with it
But they damn near shitted on themselves when we did it cause we holdin' na


I'm holdin' na, big Benz looking swollen na
Because we young, they probably thinking that we stole it na
My papers' foldin' na, cigars, we be rolling na
And it's the whole third coast and we control it na
Down south we sippin' nothin' but barre
Four TV's in my car, I'm a ghetto star
Chromin' blades on Escaldes and parking lot pimpin'
We got these broads steady trippin' cause it platinum we shippin'
From Cloverland to PA it be on for life
And if you fucking with them boys, you might lose your life
Niggas runnin' in your crib, you might lose your wife
And if we catch you at the light you might lose your ice
It's the C the N to the O-T-E
And you can crown me like a king, like my niggas UG

Motherfuckers need to be repremanded and straight jacked
These boys is givin the wrong niggas out here respect

Bitch you can go
Get another cause they love us niggas in the fast life
Niggas that can put it down and came up with they cash right

Up like a flashlight, walkin' cause of all of my bling (Bling)
One of the baddest motherfuckers that the game has seen
Think about it
From the first time that ya heard me
Way back in the 90s early
Me and my pimpin' out here doin' our thing in SWAT

I got the money, hoes, and power
We be in to see that ya cuttin' I'm all about cha'
But if ya not up in the mix girl I ain't trippin'
Cause all day all night, we steady pimpin' pimpin'

Still smokin' out, pourin' up, keep these bitches hoin' up
They break Pimp C long bread cause everything I touch be blowin' up
Candy cars, I'm a star
Choppin' blades, sippin' on bars
Young pimp I'm from the South
Run off put that piece in ya mouth
We Jone, fuck a clone
Keep a lil' bitch on my phone
All my cars blaze chrome
Bitch can't leave my dick alone, alone, alone
You ain't from no Memphis bitch
Cause I was playin' Project Pat hittin' the switch
Puttin' the dick up in ya dame
Every time make her say my name
91 I been grippin' grain
Bitch nigga wanna steal my fame, fame, fame
I be at home smokin' dro, dro
And see a nigga doin' a dance on the video
But I'm young pimp, steak and shrimp
Flyin' high like a blimp
Write my name in the sky on track
Tell the bitch to bring my money back, back, back, back bitch

He talkin' directly to you


Well if it ain't cash then I don't want it
I'm a million dollar striver, I get liver
Then the pimps that push clock punchers nine to fivers
A high diver, with mo' tricks up my sleeve than ya boy MacGuyver
A cadaver, that'll get cha' voted off my island like ""Survivor""
Is you blind, my pimpin' only gets better with age like a fine wine
And it's time to put up yo blinds
I might raise a pimp to shine
Decide to yo mind, desing
Two steps ahead of yo slow roll
You best to get a grip on ya world, world
Or we'll put that Miracle Whip on ya girl
Pimp her, let a trick sip on that pearl
Let her pay that is
Ol' sucker for love, titty baby, mama's boy
That's just the way that is
And that's the way that it's gonna be, gonna be
So ya might as well take ya lil' Heartbreak Hotel reside

With randoms and RICOs, With cameras and peep holes
Can't stand us, we chose the scandalous, who planned this your peoples?

Sell pipes and birds, water and herb, but not on the corner because I wholesale serve

Everything I drive got wood and chrome

Move over please, make room for elbows we cell phones we sell those for

We meant tied up in scotch tape, now watch fate take it up a notch

Baddest boppers under the sun

No wonder we gonna watch a stunna become a livin' landmark

You know Bun B the business street soldier in the trenches
Frontline coming down on twenty four inches
Dope boys hanging on the corners and the benches
Saying it's a drout so it's plenty of heat pinches
Boys used to come up from the rags to the riches
Plush lifestyle with the bad ass bitches
But now its like the game is full of nothing but some snitches
And wanna be gangsters thats scared to put'em in ditches
FED's taking pictures so the cameras go click
And video rolling while I'm holding my dick
They follow me around like they doing they job
But while you watching me how many people getting robbed
Lets keep it trill cause we already know
What it already is and how it already go
Thats why we chop blades coming down real slow
Pop trunks, swang, riders slam cadillac door
Pass the swisha lets blow

Where niggas'll fuck you out cho' money, yo mind, yo keys
From the days of Pugh boys, tries and Mickey D's fight
The fact that Beans was tight, B.V. on Sunday night
We had the first family, C and Mr. Chris Brown
My niggas DJ and Leroy was puttin' shit down
My DJ burns Volvo, Ski-Daddy and Big Mitch
J.B. and Big Bun one crazy son of a bitch
Y.G.'s, Lil' Daze, Rat Raw, and Ty B. and the rest
The Louis Manor Posse, some of Port Arthur's best
And Carver Terrace, known as Jesse Prince House
Westside got that way and that power will dismiss y'all
BJ, Savanah, 5-0-3, 8th Street and mini-mart
Reventual and Beverly's is full of fools with plenty heart
And Villa, Main, Jefferson, Rampart longs in ya face
With Swisha Sweet Houses all over the place
Cause it's a family affair


Hold up, gots to holla at the playas from my city
Real, trill ballers makin' half ass hustlers look shitty
Talkin' bout Linda Brown, Kita Shirley scratch
That chicken coupe, with a flock of birds ready to hatch
Lil' Earl, Big Boy fool and Percy Blake our brew
Lil' Block, O.B., Squeak can't forget about you
B.J., Kiyay, Spoon-Guy we been down here long
Lil' Lynn and K-I-R yeah them boys real strong
Gary Ellis, B. Cricket, Dooky, Shandre Shagg
J-Will, Kite, the sinuses'll kill smokin' big bags
Wreckin' Crew, R-B-J, Lucky's in the shack
Yeah that P.A. click, they got them stacks and that's a fact

I'm a pimp ass nigga, so I collect riches
Don't spend my time trickin' with hoes
Ain't supposed to hang with no snitches
Now niggas down with this, or down for offerin' shallow pockets
But when the drama jump down ain't nobody down but cha' mama
Some women fuck they men a lot, they think they pussy the bomb
No matter how much she fuck him, he in another bitch arm
And even though you sucked the mushroom head of his dick
He still gon' go back to them hoes cause in his heart he a trick
And yo bank account lookin' low
My pimpin' is straight lookin' thick
She's see the ho and I'm the pimp and straight dis this shit
You can't say ya guard low and ya covers is bare
One of my hoes just broke a trick and it's a family affair",https://genius.com/Ugk-family-affair-lyrics

You know you got respect in the mens stall
Broads having meetings up in the ladies room

Just in case you gassed up cuz last up, for you its all down from here
Far as we concerned yall need to get yall self around from here

With a solid gold byzantine cuz you know Im trill
Drop screen, sippin lean, assorted ranchers in my cup
Hitting the scene diamonds glean
A yung player with big bucks
You can tell im a pimp, by the way that I walk
You can tell Im a playa by the way that I talk
You know, I'm super fly by the car that I drive
And you kno, I dont love broads hollering pimp or die
I drink and drive

""Cause where I'm from nigga, house some motherfuckin killas""

Aiyyo Bun, there's a lotta niggas out there
That's dissin Big Tyme and U.G.K. man
But them motherfuckers don't know where we come from or where we did it
But you know what I want you to do, tell 'em where you from!

Niggas always askin what the fuck do trill stand for?
Trill mean if you ain't my nigga, what you shakin my hand for?
Trill mean if you ain't my bitch, don't sit on my lap
And if you ain't from P.A.T., nigga keep ya strap
The trill drink Olde E., out on 7th Street in Texas
Drive a 'Lac, or a Buick, motherfuck a Lexus!
Trill niggas got the big nuts and big dicks
So what they hittin fo', fool? Roll that 4-5-6
Either wearin Dickies or they sportin Hi Fashion
Sellin dope and hatin doin {?} wit a passion
Laws on the creep, so look for the nine twice
I bail to the shackle five-oh-three and roll some dice
Trill niggas hit the car wash and make 'em shine
You better watch yo' ass when you see the 99
The trill niggas only hit the streets when it's the night
At Circle K.R. Churches, to see who wanna fight
We don't take to new faces, quit airin P.A.T
You cain't just runnin talkin 'bout - ""Aiyyo, wassup G?!""
Why you pullin out you hand? I'm pullin out my gat
Catch a blast muthafucka, you don't know where you at
Cause see now P.A.T. don't stand for ""Punk Ass Tricks""
It's ""Pullin All Triggers"" and we pull them hoes quick
You talkin to a nigga wit trigger-finger twitch
If you ain't from P.A.T., I'm unloadin on you bitch!
Ain't no punks where I'm from!
""Ya muthafuckin right""
""Cause where I'm from nigga, house some motherfuckin killas""

Bump and Grill,I Got the Hook-Up! (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) ,UnKnown,"(Pimp C)
I gotta come down, I got a bangin trunk
So when I come through you feel the slab just bump
Them niggas sippin syrup and them bitches on that gin
Man hit that sweet one time for Smoke-D locked down in that pen
I'm blowin out the window, you know I'm rollin glass
I'm bumpin that Screw, that t-a-t, that boy actin a ass
Cause down in Texas nigga, we got our own stars
We got the baddest bitches and we roll the freshest cars
I flip to New Orleans Bayou Classic I'm on the scene
Got dressed at Rubensteins I step out that bitch so clean
I poured out some liquor on the street for that fool Todd
He was a trill ass nigga never came at me fraud
Man I was talkin to Playa G just the other night
He told me about this nigga that was talkin about me shife
Fool nigga this UGK Bun and C we run the streets
And tell your bitch ass brother he can't fuck with my beats
So if you wanna be bangin nigga the good shit don't come cheap
I'm talkin 7000 over 3 knock off a G
Cause fool this ain't no game nigga all about my change
I'm comin baby Fleetwood swangin on them thangs
(Chorus 4x)
I gotta come down
I gotta stay real
I gotta break them boys off bumper and grill
(Bun B)
Now tell me what it's all about in the south
Big gold grill in you mouth
Much leather inside yo car, on yo back, in yo house
Sit in a nigga's ride the seats feel like a couch
Big keys in my pouch
Bitch if it hurt say ouch
Now if I look like a south don't try to cap
You know a nigga like me be ridin dirty with big dope up in his lap
Oh, but when I'm shinin bitch I'm blazin
Hoes shrivlin up like raisins talkin bout it so amazin
How big Bun be rollin through Texas with sexy hoes keepin they wig done
Bustas bite the big one
From dis to dip this swisher houses
Let's flip from that maker maker to that after hours on Scott
They always drinkin trip mixed with crush 75 or 4
Make a nigga wanna fuss, but I can't
Cause I need the rush of codeine so I can lean
I prop a pill
Cause I'm trill to the bone
Crushin with that crome
Chorus
(N.O. Joe)
What's up bruh this N.O. Joe representin gumbo
Funk in you trunk that got yo ears wide open like you dumb ho
I'm livin larger than most a coast to coast slipper
That ice-bowl sipper that's never known to be a set tripper
Too many diamonds for you to try to look at directly
Haters don't check me they respect me
A pistol packin, no shank, shiny grill, full tank
Checkin out these bustas thinkin they real when they ain't
Y'all call me mister foreign
I'm comin down at navy porscha
Either way I'mma be a highway scorcher, blunt torcher
I'm catchin out doin 120 on the tallway the whole way
Turnin the corners that I once hung out
I got the boppers strung out
Walkin around with they tounge out
Naw, I stay behind the wheel grinnin
Burnin 500 dollar rubber, 5000 dollar rim spinnin

Well, it's me, the I-N-F-I-N-I-T-Y
Comin on the m-i-c to let you know that I

Only out for one thing, and that's to get you undercovers
You wanna lick me down, strap me down
Think you're gonna toss on me, well I won't be around
For you to put wear-and-tear on my body
If you know like I know
You better go cause I ain't even hottie
To tell you the truth, you ain't that major
Cause you made a little album and you getting the papers
Well, it's my turn and you're catchin the vapors
Before you know it, you'll be askin for favors
Remember back in PA?
When you were constantly jockin and callin my everyday
The truth hurts huh, and you won't admit
Cause, you're too busy thinking you're the shit
YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!!

Hold up dammit, you got the wrong man
I hate to bust your bubble
But, I'm down to drop a load, then I'm gone man
Ain't with no relationships and suckin on toes
I LIKE A ONE NIGHT STAND, JUST KICK IT WITH SOME HOES!
You down with that jimmie, then it's on!
The 9-2 king of the quickie, so get me then I'm gone
Just open up, and you gone get got

Let me in it, and let me out
Wham bam thank you ma'am, yeah that's what it's all about!
And, don't take it personal when I bail on ya
Just smoke a cigarette and kick it in the sauna
Cause havin me all on ya ain't the lick
You're down for a love affair
BUT SEE, I'M ONLY DOWN FOR A QUICK STICK!
So, check your watch or your clock
Cause, I ain't about havin nobody feenin on my jock!
YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!

I got to have some time to get to know ya, let me date ya
Cause one night stands ain't really in my nature
I need some substance to take it
I love you on the first night, ain't even gonna make it
Cause broken hearts, I don't had enough of
I need sensuality, not a bunch of broke love
If you can provide it, let's have it
Take your time baby, stop jumpin like a rabbit
Let's start somethin on a come-up
We can have it goin on here from sun-down to sun-up
Don't try to run up in me fast
I want to find out how long can B-U-N B last
Pass the ice and the honey, the money you can keep
Watch your back at all times, one eye open when you sleep
I can't have you for a part-time lover
Infinity has found another
CAUSE YOU'RE CRAMPIN MY STYLE!

Love you down but only for a little time
B-C-B, baby, I'm goin down for mine
My my my, I see you want me to spend the night
No, not quite, I did my part, now I'm takin flight
You just might see me again, but not soon
You can keep the wedding
I JUST WANT THE HONEYMOON!
You might be good, but see - that ain't even the point
I got all that I wanted, now I'm out of this joint
So, you can pass me my draws and pass me my cap
Cause, I ain't go be here when you wake up from your nap
And, that's the haps, no ifs ands or buts
Now, pass my matchbox, so I can hit the cut
I love them guts, but not enough to stick around
So when I raise up, you can keep on layin down

Well maybe that's cause they bitches

Stankin bitches say I hiside
Cause I pass by
Don't smoke my fuckin weed wit em
Don't let em sit on my plush crush
Three times gold, I'm a pimp ass nigga
So like a ball is how I roll
And I don't be paradin with them bitches in the street
Ho is you payin me?
Well if not ain't no need in you thinkin that you gon stay wit me
Bitch I'm a pimp cause that's the way you bitches force me to be
You say you broke well bitch you need to stop fucking for free
So when I ride by, I don't give the ho the time
Lil' girl you fine, but you must done lost yo mind
Thinkin you got game
Well bitch game is my middle name
Suckin on thangs, fuckin for fame
But bitch you plain Jane
Straight up and down
I hate silly hoes that talk a lot and try to clown
When she know that I know that she done fucked the whole town
And that I know that she a freak
Bitches say we hiside cause we pass and don't speak
Don't speak, don't speak
Bitches say we hiside cause we pass by and don't speak
I know they wanna freak (3x)
Bitches say we hiside cause we pass by

Sometimes there be a lot of shit I wanna do
But won't do, if I gotta do shit in front of you
Oh bitch don't act like you ain't nosy
I know exactly how you hoes be
Blowzy mad cause I declined when you chose me
But what I need a broke bitch for?
And how the fuck I look walkin around scratchin yo itch ho?
No keep them crabs keep that cock in that case
Cause bitch a pussy ain't nothin but my hand wit a face
And any bitch can take another bitch place
Now ain't that a foul taste
And it wasn't a fuck it was a waste of my mutherfuckin time
I coulda been somewhere flippin or smokin a dime
These bitches now a days out of they rabbit ass mind
Ho you gets no sunshine from me just because you fine
I told em I heard it through the grapevine
You ain't nothin but a freak
So now bitches say we hiside cause we pass by and don't speak

See bitches in P.A
Get mad when they see a young nigga
Full of that chronic havin it his way
But them hoes got us fucked up
The preacher got the clothes and the hoes wit his dick on swoll

I peep that shit, I read my Bible at home
Cause I ain't payin for that nigga's wrong
It's time to ride 600, picture me and Bun B
Wit 4 million two drop top gold royces
Now we smokin somethin
Them bitches tried to set us up, but we
Butt-fuck the D.A, fuck the judge, and fuck the P.A.P.D
I already gotta deal with the rednecks
And ho ass niggas in this rap game comin with that complex
But bitch this ain't no fuckin contest
And if it was we won
I'm a trill nigga live my life by the gun
I love smokin swisher sweets
Uh, now fuck them bitches that say we hiside

You catch me at the mo-tee, Bun big bone a fill' up
She might be shit to you, cause dude give her pay G
But pussy get played out, and pussy comes daily
As long as your game be strong ain't no thang
My phone always rang cause of the dope shit I sang
Keepin hoes on my dick yo, and ain't no lettin go
The net keeps flyin out, the pussy stays wet so
I turn on my VCR then I put a flick in
The hoe starts lickin that dick and pretty soon
I'm stickin that ass, like a fool in the bed
All I can see, is the top and back of your head
It ain't about conversation or make that hit
On a first name basis hoe that ain't bout shit!
Look trick, tell me how many rubbers to pack
I hit the room from the front, the ass from the back
And yo it ain't about the phone call, this about the nut'n
So let me bust a fat load on your bellybutton
See, quiet storm done put a notch on your belt
And when it's over, I don't wanna hear how it felt
I'm just pullin off my rubber, takin a bath
Gettin dressed to reminisce of how I cut ya in half
It's all in the day of an Underground fool
So dial the digits and I'm divin in that ass like a pool
But when I get wet BITCH, I won't be drownin
I clown on hoes to leave their pussyhole frownin
Or if you bitches wanna hear some more of this
Lock your bedroom door trick, pick up your cordless
You can suck a mean dick, lick a good ball
And if I keep on fuckin, you'll keep on callin
And I'll be playin you, when you think you'll be playin me
It's just pussy games with some help from AT&T
So if you need a dick to be real friendly
Dial nine-seven-six, B-U-N-B, bitch!

Bitch, who taught you how to cook food?
The next time we both gon' drop seven in a pot fool
I bet I come back with 29
Bitch Snow blow up - make the dope fiends flow up

It's all about the ducks mayne, the stash spot tucked mayne
A hundred packs stacked inside my Cadillac truck mayne
It came from cross the border, I bring 'em cross the state line
And if they catch me wit 'em I ain't finna do no state time
But see I'm trill, if they get me I'ma take mine

Pockets used to be leakin', but now my pockets hangin'

With a digital beam and a mayonnaise jar and a razor blade and an ounce of cream
Posted on magazine with a Mini-14, servin' them fiends in the middle of the night
Tryin' to get my money right, gettin' my dick sucked in the broad daylight
Clockwork, work around the clock, by myself when I go clock
Roosters, chickens, geeses, hawks, on the block goin block for block

I used to be the smallest of ballers but now I'm taller
It's a shame what that 'caine and that soda did with that water
Ask your mother or your father, your sister or either daughter
Or them ballin' ass pimpin' ass niggas from Port Arthur
I'm a starter, I go harder, mix the soft in the pot
Hit the hood, up to no good with jugs and whatnot
All gas, no brakes, no shake, just rocks
Been gettin gooder with a gang of chocks, it don't stop

Apple cranberry juice mixed with the bar
28 inches in the air we are
Two pimp niggas in the area
With them P.A. niggas, Rap-A-Lot mob
Salute to the president and I don't mean Barack
Fire up the sticky, let the champagne pop
And the big thick yellows to they knees best drop

Yeah I used to be the smallest, now I'm tallest on the yard
I'm straight up hard, I'm smilin' like Bob
I'm pimp type! MJ, act like you done heard of

And makin' up a batch that's as creamy as eggnog
The Feds log every move that I make
So I keep on switchin' clothes, switchin' cars, switchin' plates
They ride behind me undercover in the Rover
I cross over four lanes of traffic to fuck them hoes over - hol' up

Most drug dealers doin' life in the pen
Or spend they last 90,000 on a droptop Benz
Uhh, and I'm a Trill representer
I pray every night but I still Ride Dirty, I'm a sinner
If he try me I'll leave his shit on his lunch kit
Sometimes I wonder how I got off in this fuck shit
Then I look around at the cars and the clothes and the jewels and hoes
Ain't no secret, it's all exposed

Choppin' on the road, blowin on the dro

You can't stay rich if you a bitch
Cause hoes can't hold no bread
Fuck two million, niggas need a daddy

It’s Too Hard To Swallow,Too Hard to Swallow,1992.0,"Open a book, let’s take walk through the mind of a trill one
Who will come from the left real fast, tryna kill one
Or two of you hoes, by just beatin’ ya black and blue
And if I miss while I’m shooting, I’m giving my gat to you, nigga
‘Cause I ain’t scared to rest in peace
So if you wanna buy death, then invest in me
‘Cause I don’t run from a gun, I’ll take the shot and the pain
My soul might go, but my trillness remains
And even if I got bloodstains on my clothes
Hangin’ on to life, I’ll still say, “Fuck you hoes”
So if thinking ‘bout tryin’ to jack me up
I got 50,000 trill niggas to back me up, nigga
So smack me up if you think you got it like that
Shoot me all you want, I’ll be damned if I don’t fight back
Try to take mine, nigga, but I don’t forget
Gotta bring nuts to take nuts, and I got a six-pack
You want what’s mine, take me out or do what I did
Bullshit’s caught up in a muthafuckin’ hybrid
Fuck this, fuck that, fuck white, fuck black, and fuck hollow
I’m true to my shit, nigga, too hard to swallow

Now, one by one, I see muthafuckas comin’, muthfuckas go
Half went out like soldiers, they other half went out like a hoe
But by act of due process, I’ve risen to fame
By kicking ass and taking muthafuckin’ names
Again and again, I’m given fame from my actions
But with the gat in my hand, I’m the muthafuckin’ man
And any nigga out that oppose this
Just step to the stage and get your ass taken out in a blind rage
I ain’t gave a fuck since birth, but for what the shit’s worth
Ain’t no need for me to finish if I ain’t comin’ out first
And if I curse or scream out loud and banned ‘em
Muthafuckas might never see the bullet I’ma hand ‘em
See, for every nigga out there that don’t like me or spite me
You can get your ass tore with a left and a right, G
‘Cause I’m down for my shit note for note, verse for verse
Line for line, rhyme for muthafuckin’ rhyme
With my nine, my niggas, my blunts and my nuts
I put the real in your face straight from the muthafuckin’ place
That I got it from, fool, ‘cause I know that I’m bored
By you hoe ass niggas, pull your triggers
I’m too hard to swallow

Knowin’ damn well they get they muthafuckin’ wig split
Pimp C, bitch, so what the fuck is up, hoe?
Somebody better tell him better act like he know
‘Cause I don’t owe a nann nigga not a nann muthafuckin’ dime
So he better get that shit in his muthafuckin’ mind
So don’t try to play me so close, kid
‘Cause you just might catch a .38 slug in your muthafuckin’ head
So fuck all the actin’ like the hoes, and fuck the snitches
‘Cause most of them niggas is just some jealous punk bitches
Yeah, I pulled your whole rope, step up to this hoe
And get your hoe ass neck broke
I need to check a few niggas in my town
That been broke and keein’ in my face and be claimin’ that they down
A lot of niggas don’t understand but I know a few follow

Wanna rub on the grain, wanna sit on the butter
When bitch you will discover I'm a pimp and not a lover

Made sure in '96 that I'd would be gripping' on the grain
I traded in the Fleetwood, in with the new

Till one time pulled me over in my old school Oldsmobile
Officer, what's the deal?
I'm just ridin' round here on chill
With my dick on this ho's grill
Got the 98 smelling like straight kill
He said sir you know you're ridin' with one headlight
I've been rollin' for two months with them hoes on bright
He said your girl friend here is doing an awful lot of choking
It must have been that cigarette she was smokin'


Deep in the hood, I ain't driving too fast
Got my beat up loud and my ghetto pass
Why you pulling me over, what I do?
Got a funk full of dope, nationwide too
We in stores and we independent
That's why we always ride new benzes
I was smokin', yeah I did that
But it wasn't no weed, it was a cigarette
Now I gotta get out, I already know my part
People stopping' and staring, cause they know I'm a star

Got a stable of 'em, I never run outta freaks
Ridin' through the hood, high sidin' lookin' good
I blow a bitch mind every motherfucking time
With these pimp lines
Spittin' out the window
Car full of smoke but it wasn't no indo


Saturday night, we in the mix
A whole lotta bitches and a whole lotta tricks
I'm upstairs at the bar with hoes taking flicks
Try'na pick out the one that love to suck dick
I got two or three blunts rolled already
Two or three chicks ready to go already
I'm fired up, startin' to blow already
These hoes take one puff and blown already
We trippin' and we kicking' it
Drinkin' up, smokin' shit
DJs bumpin' hype shit, getting' a bitch open shit

Nose in the air sweating a nigga 'bout sparking up

Top drop down, top top drop down

When the top starts fallin the bitches start callin
My trunk start bangin and the fo's start crawlin
The drank mixed up, in the cream soda bottle
Her lips, hit my dick that's why I smashed on the throttle
Swisha Sweet candy, Robert Davis in my cup
I'm swervin like Bootsy but I couldn't give a fuck (fuck)

They both for me now watch them girls get buck (buck)
Ain't shit friendly but we still have fun (fun)

The great state of Texas, candy in the Lexus
Dick for them hoes jaws, pistols for the flexers
Somebody asked me why I'm ridin on the East
All I did was told the truth, the bullshit niggas cease (cease)
If you ain't hatin nigga why the fuck you mad?
If your records ain't sellin, get your fingers out ya ass, bitch!

The granddaddy kush mixed with a little O.G. (fo' sho')
That's my breakfast, off top I gotta blow three
Not to mention codeine, liquid and the pill (pill)
Bloats on my grill with my hand on my steel (steel)
Just another day in the life of a King
So while the candy paint drip, and the Cadillac swing
I'mma gon' and pop the trunk, surely but slowly
Let you see my name in lights, just so you know me
I'm gettin more points than Kobe, for my G-ness
Regardless of who's comin after me you gon' see list
Rims ain't big enough, paint don't glisten
And your trunk don't even rattle from your garbage ass system (no)
Your slab ain't holdin, ain't no use to you frontin
And I'm fin' to shut the game down when I push the button
And the.. {*echoes*}


Swangin on fo's nigga, uhh
Back on the slab for the first time, I'm full of that purp' nine
Boys mad at me cause I know what I'm worth now
Droppin them tops down, beatin the blocks down
Leavin 'em with they mouth wide, stuck at the stop sign
Blow-Pop candy paint glistenin off my panky rang
Listenin to some old school Underground Kiiiiingz
So you know I'm sittin on swaaaaang
Cory Mo about to do the damn thaaaaang
In the butter guts with the diamond in the back
King Kongs in the trunk, hit the switch and watch it crack
I'mma let my paper stack and quote nothin but facts
So don't ""ax"" me nothin partner 'less you droppin some cash (cash)
Now she hoppin it fast (fast) that's just how I like it (like it)

Look like they worth G's / dress above they knee's
????? and g-strings up they back side
Takin' up all that slack right
So tell me where can I find him
With they playas ???? and that candy cadillac right behind em

Hooker's tellin' me 'C' you so grand
All she wanna do is ride suburb vans
Put her ass on the leather and rub my wood
See we got boppers in Texas so her body look good
I let the thugs ride and I show her my grip
But she blinded by the candy she can't see I'm a pimp
So when she told me I look good I didn't feel no pride
All she really want to do is just whip my ride
Chorus 
Now I stare a playa down when he step to the boy
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come on, who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
They look your partna up and down like he a superstar
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come, on who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me they wanna ride in my car

Oh yeah, they really think they cute
In skin tight cat suits
Assumin' that they body's too boomin' to dispute
But you know it's the root of all drama
And attributes put up in they head by they momma
Oh yeah, Ima tell it like it is
I seen where ya been in
These fools talkin' about how they be passin' around women
But all you do with them is kick it, you ain't wicked cricket
You just doin' a whole lotta trickin'
Fifty dollars there, a hundred dollars here
Man you bought her a drink, all the homegirls up
Ya homeboy's is lookin for ya
But look what you did you left your partnas at the club
And took the bitches to the crib and didn't even hit it
Man you need to quit it, they don't want to hit it
They need to get up out my Shhhhh you know what I mean
I ain't showin' nobody off so they can be seen
You know what I mean

Now I stare a playa down when he step to the boy
But they ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
Come on, who the hell you think you are, by far
They ain't trippin on me, they wanna ride in my car
They look your partna up and down like he a superstar

Wrote none of these rhymes
Put none of these track toghether

You spent your money
You've been waiting

The Corruptor’s Execution,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Hold up
It's the motherfuckin' corruptor, since I came I was a hustler
It's a shame, I got to blow out niggas brains
To make these motherfuckers peep my game
I let 'em hang to the flo', snot on the snow
And full of kicked on rivals, it's for survival, in the intestines of the city
'Cause the game's shitty, and Piggly Wiggly on the payroll
So they can't bust us and we shine like diamond clusters
'Cause we some made motherfuckers
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I be workin' and twerkin' my portable digital
Triple beamer scale like a teeter-totter
Kind of like a see-saw, up and down
A hundred and twelve milligrams of some of that
There soft white baby powder, equals a they call up the Valley
Heat up in the garbage dumpster, ""Who's sack is dat?""
All the tiffles and po'po' I got it back, don't make me do ya
I know these streets, like the Grayson's know jujitsu
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
I'm havin' small change with gats and hundred sacks
I got to ball main with thangs, I let 'em hang
It ain't at all strange with game, remain the Savage
And cabbage, got to come, if not, five-oh for one
I come with guns smokin' leave you croakin' in Oakland
Without no words spoken put the Chevy in drive
And ride the block hopin' not to choke up in back
With the strap, and the kick in the back, imagine that
Because I take out my weapon and I quickly start bustin'
I go, cold loco lay 'em down by the dozen
I look at my riders, they say nothing's confusin'
Why, why, why? It's the corruptor's execution
It's the corruptor's execution
Now, we get the cash the stash and bash
Your brains all over this dashboard
Give up the hash, and get you some gas
Who'll blast you main in man's sport
Now, brrr, stick 'em I kick 'em, Bobby you lick 'em
We stole 'em and brick 'em to death
K.S.'ll go left, finger flick 'em, bitches is breathin'
They last motherfuckin', breath
On the real how you feel about caps get peeled
I just baby, deal with the talk
You backin' the guns and all the law
So just hopin' these bastards know that we strong
Fuckin 'em quick in the back with the dick then
Make sure while they don't know throw a trick in

Pockets once was phat but now your bummin' smokes
And now your gung ho got'cha niggas by your side
And the topic of your every conversation's let's ride
But let's take 5 and then put that shit aside
But you know as well as I know

What they want to do
Them niggas quick to cock they straps
We cock straps too
And we blast on fools,fuck you over

I'm comin' from a school where if ah nigga mouth
Get out-We aim the hit at you
Method subliminal-I'm The Original
That bullshit I heard on your disc was pitiful
I'm critical-nigga I ride around and housin'

To Broadway in ah broad day
Now I brought the underground plunger
Sound from down under
Somethin' like when that thunder pound

Hey I'm from the South mane
Plus I'm the south main fanatical film broker

Close your mouth mane
I ain't ask to see your tonsil's or your tongue
Lookin' sprung like The Prince was for Repunzil
I gets twisted like a pretzel these rappers cryin' the blues
Cause I make this shit look crazier than tyin' my shoes
People ask me do I write rhymes
