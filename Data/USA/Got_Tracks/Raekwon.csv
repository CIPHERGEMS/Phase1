Ice Cream,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…,1995.0,"Ma, throw down some money
The ice cream man is coming

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, Wu tears it up

Yo, honey dip, summertime fine, Jheri dripping
Seen you on Pitkins
 
with a bunch of chickens how you're cliquing
I kept shooting strong notes as we got close
She rocked rope, honey throat smelling like Impulse
Your whole shell baby's wicked like Nimrod
Caught me like a freshwater scrod, or may I not be God?
Attitude is very rude, boo, crabby like seafood
It turns me on like Vine's Cee Allah Rule
They call me Starky Love, hon, check the strategy
By any means,
 
Shirley Temple curls was done by Billie Jeans
Black Mrs. America, your name is Erica, right, true
Lazy eyeball, small feet, six shoe
Caramel complexion, breath smelling like cinnamon
Excuse me, hon, the Don mean no harm, turn around again
Goddamn, backyard's banging like a Benzi
If I was jiggy, you'd be spotted like Spuds McKenzie
I'm high-powered, put Adina Howard to sleep
Yo, pardon, that bitch been on my mind all week
But, uh, back to you, Maybelline queen, let's make a team
You can have anything in this world except cream
So what you wanna do? What you wanna do?
Let's go ahead and walk these dogs and represent Wu

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
And scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

Shaolin's finest, what up, boo? Peace, your highness
Yo, I'm lounging big dick style, y'all niggas is the flyest
Moves you're making, too fly, jewels are shaking
Not a rape patient, you're looking good, fly-colored Asian
Ghettoes, them is your hometown
We can go the whole round
After that, I'm shooting downtown
I'm rocking hats and your wig is all intact
Who's that queen bee chick, eyes pearly black?
Freaks be moving in fly sneaks
Two-finger rings and gold teeth and ain't afraid to hold heat
So when I step in the square, dear
You better have cream to share, Ricans, ven aqui, yeah

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in my ice cream truck, who tears it up

Black chocolate girl wonder, shake ground like thunder
Politic to your deficit step, give me your number
Your sexy persuasive tatas and thighs
Catch my eyes like pies, I want your bodily surprise
Double down some time
Ice cream, you got me falling out like a cripple
I love you like I love my dick size
Ooh, baby, I miss you, your sweet tender touches
Take pulls off the Dutches
Orgasm in my mind-state, masturbate in your clutches
I want you for self like wealth, so play me closely
Bitches paranoia for the sting, who want the most of me?
Only a hard dozen wanna be calling me cousin
Thirsty for my catalog, baby, shopping spree you're loving
Call me if you wanna get dug like the pockets
I jizz 'em like a giant, break wombs out of the sockets

Wu-Tang in the cut, for real niggas, what?
It's the afterparty and bitches wantna fuck

Watch these rap niggas get all up in your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in my clutch
And want they titties sucked, ice cream, yeah
Your guts
French vanilla, butter pecan, chocolate deluxe
Even caramel sundaes is getting touched
Scooped in the ice cream truck, who tears it up
Ice cold bitches melt down when in the clutch
They want they titties sucked, ice cream

One love to my chocolate deluxes
Keep your nails done and your wigs tight, word up
One love to my butter pecan Ricans for calling me papi
That's for real
One love to caramel sundaes with the cherries on top, yeah
And big up to my French vanillas

Verbal Intercourse,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…,1995.0,"No tricks, no tricks, baby
Yeah, ayy, yo, Rae, check me out, y'all
It's the science (Fly wonderful, yeah, y'all)
Tony Starks and, umm, Lex Diamonds (Tony Starks)
My nigga Nas
Word up
Stay wise
All types of shit, yo, son
Hit these kids mad, couldn't know our story, right?
Show those crabs how to rhyme (Yeah, baby)
Shake a nigga with a few of them joints
It's only like five percent out of a hundred
Do it to 'em, baby

Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamor, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace, leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run, police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf, I hold heat nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real, it never haunts me, while
Funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster-heads profile on the bus to Rikers Isle
Holding weed inside they pussy with they minds on the pretty things in life
Props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle, niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back, do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life rapidly, that's the ritual

Perhaps bullets bust, niggas discuss mad money
True lies and white guys, we can see it through the eyes
Catch the most on tape, kilos disintegrate
Pyrex pots, we break, fiends licking plates
In the building, niggas building, like little children, staring
Them older niggas ain't caring
Sirens circling, fiends are lurking in your baggage
Oh, one's gone now, what? Smack him in his cabbage
In the woodwork
Crack sales bubble like Woolworths in the projects
Richest niggas rocking all the real worth
Police questioning, rooftop cats invested in
Trading in they Lexuses, GSs, sending messages
Two and two makes four, Cristals crazily pour
Gun wars, my crew feel 'em like swords

With the green leathers, hundred-pound snakes and cakes
Fiends found in lakes, jealously jakes we shake
What I strive for is what I live for
Infatuated by material things in this wild life of war
Like somewhere over the rainbow, I see a big pot of gold
Future stacks, so I hold
Thousands of cracks bagged up inside the shoebox
Don't keep jack in my lab, don't wanna see 2Pac
Got two spots on New Lots flooded with rocks
Shootouts making me hot, crooked cops, bag Tony and the ball drop
In denial, I'm banging niggas for slot time
Hurry up, duke, I'm next on line
And what the fuck is you looking at?
By the way young blood hit me off with that Green Bay hat
Watch your back inside the hall, new niggas slide through
Like doors, yo, you're staring in the mess hall
Your adrenaline runs
, 
cigarette niggas be swindling
New jacks surrendering, come home not remembering
Made bail with different size kicks on, a white dress shirt
Looking gay in the yard and you got hurt
Flashbacks of the day room, mop wringer style
Your faggot ass got bashed trying to turn the dial
You told your boo you was wildin'
Once you heard Wu, out of the blue, your family's from Shaolin
High class cooks, throw on vests out of phone books
Infirmary niggas are screaming, ""I got juxed""
Sharpened toothbrushes
, 
one-ninety mixed with baby oil and shit
Your man's in the kitchen stashing ice picks
Well I'ma end this with a big red cherry on top
Me, Nas, and Rae got the best product on the block

Cream, my whole team is eatin' off of this good shit (
Word up, throw your hands up

Guillotine (Swordz),Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…,1995.0,"Allow me to demonstrate the skill of Shaolin
The special technique of shadowboxing

Poisonous (Word, word, word), slap (Poisonous)
Y'all should slap these⁠— all y'all niggas for comin' in my fuckin' face with that shit
 (Shh, shh, alright, cool)
Yo, man, go ahead
Poisonous

Poisonous paragraphs smash your phonograph in half
It be the Inspectah Deck on the warpath
First class, leavin' mics with a cast
Causin' ruckus like the aftermath when guns blast
Run fast, here comes the verbal assaulter
Rhymes runnin' wild like a child in a walker
I scored from the inner slums abroad
And my thoughts are razor sharp, I slice the mic from the cord
First to criticize, but now they have become
Mentally paralyzed with hits that I devise
Now I testify, the best is I
Rebel INS, Your Highness, blessed to electrify
With voltage of a eel, truth that I reveal
Will crush the amateurs who scream they keep it real
Caesar black down, hoodied up in fatigues
Part time minor leagues 
receive third degrees
Attack like a wolf pack once I pull back
The God-U
 
and bust through like a fullback

Yo, you fourteen carat gold slum computer wizard
Tappin' inside my rap vein causes blizzards
The wildlife that kills for ice trife
 like by the digits
Gorillas injected with strength of eighty midgets
The Earth spins ruins, rap exotic blends
Let my peeps in, niggas gaspin', swallowin' aspirins
With a dosage, you overdosed in rap
High explosives, my posters hypnotize with hypnosis
I sell goods, my whole Clan is on the run like Natural Born Killers
Record-breakin' the album Thriller
Got access to tear gas, bombs and rocket launchers
Flow like dough, Killa Beez is what I sponsor
Your entrepreneur, pens and gear like Shakespeare
When I fuck, I grab hair, 
collect drawers as souvenirs
Fuck yeah, my crew down German beers
My career's based on guns throwin' cats in wheelchairs
Et cetera, damage any lame-ass competitor
Who try to front, get broken in fast like leathers
Whatever, hot hard-heads get shattered like mirrors
Beretta shots splatter your goose, scatter your feathers
Say never poetry chumps crumbs deal with graphic
Flew my family overseas, I'm maxin'
If rap was crack, fully packed, I'd be tall caps
Taxin' kingpin of the rap drug traffickin'
Village niggas get slapped in Manhattan for rappin'
Big Ghost steps off laughin', ha

Were you just using the Wu-Tang school method against me?
I've learned so many styles, forgive me

Sit back, relax, fake niggas don't get turns
Watch me massage your brain with slang that's king
Projects filled with young men cause threats
Who has that? Thousand dollar chains and TECs
Focus, the brokest niggas of life shit
These mics is like cocaine, son, check the suicidal hype shit
Exchange mad blunts, tapes for sweepstakes
Keepin' up on fakes, outta state for cakes
, no doubt
Plus nobody amount, we makin' dough off
Puttin' fifty on the Land and Allah, it's like that
Pull ya shoes up, black, matter of fact, just adapt
Tie up your black Nikes and tight hats
Corners stay surrounded with foreigners, 
what up, dread?
Feds caught your bredren for his bread
, but regardless
Peace to jail niggas with charges
Unify layin' in the yard with La
My Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Slingers and gamblers and gram handlers
Tical, light the Owl cigar, let's get steamed
Infrared guard your beam, so seek 'nuff respect
Rude bwoy, you bet, keep it movin',
 
Mashallah
Pro black like tar, designin' the fly shit and stay shinin'
The RZA pour more beats than Cristal's fine wine
Concrete raps, go to bat
With 50 other niggas on the other side of the map
'Til it's all good and all done, what we want, son
Mike Tyson of this rap shit,
 
pullin' out Macs for fun

The nigga don't get mad, I got mad styles of my own
And it's shown when my hands grip the chrome microphone
Verbally, I catch bodies with cordless shotties
Intriguin' MCs, I keep 'em trained like potties
I bomb facts, 
my sword is an ax to split backs
Visible, like dope fiend tracks
Sky's the limit, niggas are timid
And nobody knows 
how we move like wolves in sheep clothes
Producin' data, microchips of software
Underground and off-air, the land of the lost

Incarcerated Scarfaces,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx…,1995.0,"He looks determined without being ruthless
Something heroic in his manner
There's a courage about him, doesn't look like a killer
Comes across so calm
Acts like he has a dream
Full of passion
You don't trust me, huh?
Well, you know why
I do, we're not supposed to trust anyone in our profession anyway

Knock niggas out the box all the time
Niggas know my motherfuckin' repertoire, big ones (Uh-huh)
(Yeah, motherfucker, straight up)
(I'll fuck your whole team up) 
Take care of B.I.

(Yeah, bust it, yo, yo) Fly G.I. niggas

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

Thug-related style attract millions, fans
They understand my plan, who's the kid up in the green Land?
Me and the RZA connect, blow a fuse, you lose
Half-ass crews get demolished and bruised
Fake be fronting, hourglass-heads niggas be wanting
Shutting down your slot, time for pumping
Poisonous sting, which thumps up and act chumps
Rae's a heavy generator, but yo, guess who's the black Trump?
Dough be flowing by the hours, Wu, we got the collars
Scholars, word life, peace to Power and my whole unit
Word up, quick to set it, don't wet it
Real niggas lick shots, peace Connecticut

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out

Chef'll shine like marble, rhyme remarkable
Real niggas raise up, spend your money, argue
But this time is for the uninvited
Go 'head and rhyme to it, bitch nigga, mics is getting fired
More fiends, chicks be burning like chlorine
Niggas recognize from here to Baltimore to Fort Greene
But hold up, Moët be tasting like throw-up
My mob roll up, dripped to death, whips rolled up
You never had no wins, sliding in these dens
With Timbs, with MAC-10's and broke friends
You got guns? Got guns too, what up, son?
Do you wanna battle for cash and see who sons who?
I'll probably wax tracks, smack rap niggas, you, facts
Niggas' lyrics are wack, nigga
Can't stand unofficial, wet tissue, blank busting Scud missiles
You rolling like Trump, you get your meat lumped
For real, it's just slang rap democracy
Here's the policy, slide off the ring, plus the Wallabees
Check the status, soon to see me at, Caesar's Palace eating salads
We beating mics sending keys to Dallas
I move rhymes like retail, make sure shit sell
From where we at to my man's cell
From staircase to stage, minimum wage
But soon to get a article in Rap Page
But all I need is my house, my gat, my Ac'
Bank account fat, it's going down like that
And pardon the French, but let me speak Italian
Black stallions wildling on Shaolin
That means the island of Staten
And niggas carry gats and mad police from Manhattan

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases
Word up, peace, incarcerated scarfaces

I do this for barber shop niggas in the Plaza
Catching asthma, Rae is sticking gun-flashers
Well-dressed, skating through the projects with big ones
Broke elevators, turn the lights out, stick one upstairs
Switch like a chameleon, hit Brazilians
Pass the cash or leave your children, leave the building
Niggas, yo, they be folding like envelopes
Under pressure, like Lou Ferrigno on coke
Yo, Africans denying niggas up in yellow cabs
Musty like fuck, waving they arms to Arabs
Sit back, cooling like Kahlúas on rocks
On the crack spots, rubber band wrap all my knots
View bitches who fuck dreads on Sudafeds
Pussy's hurting, they did it for a yard for the feds
Word up, cousin, nigga, I seen it
Like a 27-inch Zenith, believe it

Now, yo, yo, what up, yo? Time is runnin' out
It's for real, though, let's connect, politic, ditto
We could trade places, get lifted in the staircases

Yo, (Blaow) first of all, son, peep the arson
Many brothers I be sparkin' and bustin' mad light inside the dark
Call me dough snatcher, just the brother for the rapture
I hang glide, holdin' on strong, hard to capture
Extravagant, RZA bake the track and it's militant
Then I react like a convict and start killin' shit
It's manifested, the gods work like appliances
Dealin' in my cypher I revolve around sciences
The 9th chamber, leave you trapped inside my hallway
You try to flee but you got smoked up by the doorway (Blaow)
No question, I send your ass back right to the essence
Your whole frame is smothered in dirt, now how you restin'?
While I'll be trapped by sounds, locked behind loops
Throwin' niggas off airplanes 'cause cash rules (Cash rules)
Everything around me, black, as you can see
Swallow this murder one verse like god degree
Then analyze my soundtrack for satisfaction
You adapt like a flashback, chain reaction
(Lace them niggas, son)

AK's black, bust back like seventy MACs
I'm all that, street niggas knowin' my steez, black
Ron G, you know he coincide with me, see
Marvelous menace for society
But anyway, let's toast, champagne thoughts with Ghost
I max the most shotguns through the nose
Fuck rap, hip-hop put me on top
'Lo wears and Tommy Hil' fly shit with a knot
The witty unpredictable live shit, drive-by shit
Do-or-die shit, I'll take your lye and shit
And then you know I'm runnin' through the penal
Foul, fall through, child was wild
The old lady snitched, but fuck it, you know what?
One love, kid, no, I'm not doin' a bid
Too much to get, for what, 'cause six niggas got stuck
And the nigga chain was truck?
Yo, fuck that, criminology rap, sneakers stay
Jet-black floatin' in the flyest Ac', nigga

Double-breasted, bulletproof vested, well protected

Casting stones, cracking two hundred and six bones
And watch your ass get thrown to a sea of fire and brimstone
How dare you approach it with them poems?
The overfiend, light nova beam gleam, show 'em what a soldier mean
The grand exquisite imperial wizard or is it
The RZArector come to pay your ass a visit?
Local biochemical, universal giant, the black general
Licking shots at Davy Crockett on the bicentennial
Happy millennium two thousand
Microchips, two shots of penicillin goes up your adrenaline
Son, it's time for bouting
It's a model you're resembling, the niggas who like following
Trapped inside your projects like a genie inside the bottle and

God stepping forth upon holy ground of the track
It's the sound that surrounds and hurts me like I'm under attack
So I decided to bite down on the mic
So the pain of the track won't deny the fact that I'm the master
For what lurks is an expert that hurts
The individual who tries to visualize under
'Cause I strike like thunder
Niggas couldn't stand my heat, it's unbearable
My wisdom fucks up your respitorial
Systems are fractured by the killer tactics
Style is ragged and thoughts are mad jagged
Enter the entity, my vicinity
Is three hundred and sixty degrees of humidity
Represent the school of hard knocks and Glocks, my
Clan is hostile, got mad moss for blocks, so
Feel the force of impact from the iron side of the gat as I attack the track
From the blind side of the pack, Starks, pass the chrome

Full moons make me howl like a wolf out of breath
Soley on Wu cords y'all heard Genius on Gef
So step back to the lab at high velocity
My team make hand-to-hand sales, we're like a pharmacy
Fuck Geraldo, Pablo's plan bro is Bravo
Goodfellas, we know bestsellers become novels
The man rocking headbands, silk scarves, and jams
Early '80s British Walkers, playboys, mocks, and shams
The laser beam vocalist does well at symphonies
Bad days, watch me snatch ice right outta Tiffany's
Remember them kids that came off with eight million?
Robbed the Brinks and I labelled in royal pavilions
Them flour-heads must have been stupid
Tell me how the fuck black niggas get caught with all that loot, kid?
There's jet money, underground money

Degrees of punishment increase intensely
Syndrome was caused by the deadly drums
But the battle was won by swords bein' swung
Slicin' with a vocal from the international vocalist
Your style is too local to fuck with this
Offensive antagonist
No assistance, movin' motionless
Mysterious swiftness
Thoughts roll down the shaft of the brain
Mental gives the signal to the physical
Whirlwind kicks and hits from every angle
Violent temperaments left continents dented
Poison vintage wine rhymes I invented
Drunk by the drunken 
punches
 that punctures the heart
Vital sparks from the arteries stopped

But luckily I'm born to be wild and then be out
Move crowds, collect twenty thou' and then be out
Heavy convoys, my crew keep pretty boys paranoid
Built like a steroid 
pat down Dan Aykroyd
My seeds grow with his seeds, marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang money all up in the family

The treasure is the glaciers of ice
The treasure is the glaciers of ice
The treasure is the glaciers of ice

original man
Possess the power to hold G's, guns and grams
Baker, baker, pull off a 
Keystone caper
Point out the baddest bitch in the house and watch me scrape her

Been a long time since the Father left in '69
It's been a long time since Wu-Tang had the chance to shine
It's been a long time since we had diamonds, gold and drank Cristal wine
It's been a long time, my people walking around here dumb, deaf, and blind
It's been a long time since you had a Son of Man chant like golden wine

Alright, don't play me like I got a flowerpot head, kid (*Loading clip*), on the real, man
Just chill, let's go get this money fast, son
I know how we got to do this, kid (*Gunshots*), trust this (Alright, scrungy-head motherfuckers)

Lay on the crime scene, sipping fine wines, pulling nines on
UFOs, taking they fly clothes, they eyes closed
We getting loot, no doubt, check the word of mouth
Unheard about, guns go off and now a murder route
I'm out, my raps play the part like a Get Smart secret agent
In a maze and style's blazing
Johnny Blaze and Tony Starks in the Days Inn
And Rhyming, my nigga Lou Diamond with Robert F
We like Meth to go and fuck with Noodles
Having them poodles on the lockdown, buying me
Amarettos and chewables, smacking pharmaceutical
Rap niggas on dust and woos
Yo, I told you some killed, robbed and fold
The goal's untold, fuck it, it beats parole
So stroll marvelous, soul controller of the globe blow
Goddamn, I got it sewn and yo
What up wop? Pop the suitcase high and we can talk
You can walk out the fucking building and get caught
Save the fully inflatable, rap relatable
Drug relatable, niggas here to play with you
A hundred dollar Rottweiler, go to spot sellers
Guns and Glocks for them niggas who got props
Off top jail niggas get mad bigger and yo
Mail a guy about a hundred pictures
Word to mama, this rap wonder rhymer team got drama
Comma, blunt smoke real-ass marijuana
Chef Maranzano boats across the Verrazano
Immaculate, bust off my gun so accurate
And get cream in the cuisine of Queens
I told you, money skated with night beams and two rings

Crazy fag, I'm getting ready to do this shit (Sniff mad shit)
Man, niggas know not to step on this shit

Who's the knucklehead wanting respect?
Chop his fingers in the drug game, money well-known
Lead singer, humdinger, flash is the aftermath, here's his photograph
Run up in his lab, take off the mask, Chas, and think fast
Don't laugh, bag the cash, grab the hash, don't forget his stash
Grab the tear gas and place it in his face fast
At full blast (*Speeding car passing*)
Then skate to the next gate further upstate
I heard they got crazy weight bagged up by the cakes in
Crates like disco breaks, yo look out for jakes
Give it all it takes, let's burn the place before we motivate
Yo, Blake, nigga, don't fake, rape his mate
If the bitch scream, for God's sake grab the grey tape
It's by the plate with the blow crushed up with the flakes
Killer snakes, four bodies found floating in lakes
Drug related paper talking about the kids who didn't make it
Hits without a trace, never seen the bricks, see Rae and Ghostface
Congratulations, Chef, let's celebrate and sniff an eighth (*Tires screeching*)

The rap scar is on, rap Parmesan, poke on, put it on, seal it on
We're silicone, spark it on your talkathon
This rap phenomenon to correspond took the arms
Hit me on the hip and horns, rap chaperone
Scars, tones, bar thrown, war tones, raw tones
Blowing out their jawbones, but your rap's fraudulent
Plug in these rap coordinates, it's reinforced with suspense
Be on your rap sword defense
These microphone professional, sensational, fully operational
I got niggas here to play with you, you know the steez
You know my whole program, brothers from the no-lands
All we want is the G's, guns and grams
Living fat like the Hoffa, mafia, sipping, eating pastas
Laying in the house telling the seeds about the sagas
Before we got dramatic and thoughts got sporadic
We grabbed golden tablets and quick guarded the Abbots
Slugs hit the Pelle, punch hopes into the belly
Suckers tried to knock me out the box like Skelly
I smoke the weed trees, I drop top to the breeze
Honey dip spending G's on nails and hair weave
The crime boss taking no loss, excessive force
We can play the A-Train back of the iron horse

Crazy piece, buying keys in Greece
Was a rich nigga, picture the nigga without dough figures
Condo with his chick, rocking the gold vigor
Mafia flicks, tying up tricks was his main hobby
Teaching his seed Wu-Tang karate
Mixing drinks in clubs, hairy chest with many minks
Night time rolling with snakes
Extra live, he claimed he couldn't die, top rank
Sixteen shots in his fish tank
And his pet piranha, he named him Marijuana
Smoking ganja, calling his weed pipe Sandra
Claiming New York was ancient Babylon
Where the sky stayed the color of grey, like heron

But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping over SIXTY-TWO's
Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G, I had to get P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
Four chumps trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand
Cause man

A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M
Still struggling, Survival got me buggin'

Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough

Still strugglin'

Lay out your maintain

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one
And that one, pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smoking woolies at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G's

On rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich, son, show and prove, ask my bitch
Stood up late nights, build with my a-alikes
We can pull a heist, snatch ice or rock mics
But this rap shit, got me wanna clack back the latch
How it goes the only pesos made from scratch
But in due time, soon to get mine like Bugsy
Heavy on the wrist, Polo mocs, socks and rugbies
Old flicks remind me of Gucci's
Back in Union Square when little Maxmil blast Pierre
That was Build Build, fast forward, ninety-four
Who got the bad base? Filthiest fiends scream for more
Bless me out of state, howdy, Jake, 
Starks is back
Niggas want work, nine brought back off a g-pack
Coke rocks flood the co-ops, live in gossip
Them big lip niggas singing to cops need to box it
Stop it, the projects over-flooded with slow leaks

What brings rain, hail, snow, and earthquakes?
The beat breaks, 'cause all my niggas to break, son
Styles is similar to criminals locked up
With gats, ghetto tabernacles is fucked up
I live once, though the mind stays infinite
Traveling to touch nine planets in my midst
While I carry, to earn a decent salary
Soon get married, raise a family, but the plan'll be
Real great, to sit up in the loft, count stacks and max
And real cats cold watch my back
But listen to the Wu, son, and maintain
It's all real, starving individuals kill
I puff what's only right, leave the poison alone
Projects infested with rats, cats, and crack, holmes
Half of us'll try to make it, the other half'll try to take it
So many fake, half real freedom-build
Born to science my alliance analyzes
Wild surprises, keeping my eyes wide to this
The unfortunate, laying in mountains counting
With jewelry on, can it be the next team house the horn
Chill dun, just for real ones, light the lye up
I hate to have to tie the next guy up

Check the banging-est sounds that I invent
Fake niggas who tried to flex hard came and went
They couldn't match up with the fly nigga with his back against the wall
Heads clocked once I came in the door
I played the speaker, sippin' a Kahlua
Saw this bad bitch wit' a switch and, yo, I had to step to her
In a manner, and rather wished the current was warm
When I had reached her, I looked and knew the shit was on
Peace, excuse me, allow to introduce myself
Yo, I'm the man, and honey, you've been rated top shelf
Yo, what's your name, hon? Hair wrapped up in a bun
Your eyes sparkle just like glass in the sun
Never diss 'em, it's hard for a nigga just to miss 'em
Especially when you're browsin', goin' fishing
Your waistline bangin' like a bassline
Physical form is well complex, and, yo, I love your outline, boo
Your whole body is wild with your rugged profile
Enough to make a hard rock smile
You can't strike out, tell me what can really go wrong
You're rocking labels, Tommy Hil' down to Claiborne
Show me some love, hon, show me some love, boo
Show me the vibe and I'll be more than glad to shoot it through
Ayo, peep it, I know you love Victoria's Secret
And lovin' all the marvelous slang on how I freaked it
Plus, see you're the type to make a nigga crash
Far from trash, your flesh is way softer than a baby's ass
Your body lotion is the potion
This shit got me open like dust and, yo, your stee is Thai potent, yo
We can go the distance, I'll put you under wings
From this convo, we can spark and see whatever brings
I walked the hot Arabian desert barefooted
I grabbed your hair, you grabbed my joint and knew where to put it

Word up, yo, straight up and down, yo
Check the joint, baby
It be the Wu-Tang production
Yeah, yeah, and all types of shit
And brothers catchin' repercussions
Yo, straight up",https://genius.com/Raekwon-wisdom-body-lyrics

Doing my regular thing, man
So I'ma get back up with you though, baby
Know what I'm sayin'? You know you my nigga, kid
I'ma always come through for you, baby

What's up, baby? God damn, look at you, man
Damn, God, I love the shit out you, man
Man, I done watched you, man, since you was a little crumb-snatcher
A little weed-hopper lookin' to runnin' around here, man
Look at you, baby, you look good, you understand?
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
I've watched you go through a lot of trials and tribulations, Rae
(
G-O-D's my reality
)
But you know something? Like I used to always tell you, baby
A good listener's a good learner
I see you listened very well, you understand?
(I'm elevating strong and I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
Your time is comin', baby
And see, sometime, it could be like a, a rear view, you know what I'm sayin'?
And people don't know when their blessing comes
But I've watched you grow, baby, man, and you's a very intelligent man
Man, I watched you when I would just sit down
And you would just trick me out my money, shootin' dice, nigga, is you crazy? Hahahaha (Crazy, you crazy, man)
(G-O-D's my reality)
Yo, man, you remember that shit, man?
When we would be down there in the hills and shit, man?
(I'm elevating strong I'm gonna go on to the highest degree)
And you'd catch the— oh, here come Old Man Freed
""Yeah, I'ma get him, ya little slick ass"" (
Hahahaha
)
Talk to me, baby, you know what I'm sayin'? (
Hahaha
)
I remember all them things
But I'm watchin' you growin' (
Yeah
)
But remember one thing, Rae, like I used to tell you
The child you was was making you the man you is today
And if you don't know where you came from, baby
You damn sure know— you don't know where you're goin'
Can you see what I'm saying?
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead, oh)
Know which way you traveling
You understand? And follow that destiny and follow the light
And it'll set you free
(G-O-D's my reality)
'Cause I've watched you, baby, you my main man (
Yeah
)
(I'm elevating strong and we're gonna go on to the highest degree)

Now that could be the Wu-Tang production
Start to knuckle up and gun shots start to click, the block's duckin'
Could it be and would it be that we was babies?
Catchin' rabies, niggas seem to act crazy
Day one in my spot, July the tenth
I had a mint, stickin' up Devines hittin' them with nines
I was toxie from layin' up in Roxy's all night
This nigga bust a shot, licked my man's wife
It was havoc, I contact the Abbot
He shook the shoulder though,
 then he passed the phat chrome automatic
We goin' to war, you know he had a two-to-four
He would've did it for me, fuck it, let's mosie
Scheming dough with the P.L.O. wrapped on tight
Sayin' in my mic, ""Yo, we gotta go""
My first impression was to ask some lessons
Question one, what made you even show your gun and blow the session?
He replied and rocked the green eye
And, yo, he started yellin', ""Them niggas sellin' two for fives""
But he's a goner 
and I got my corner
, what?
I'm feeding my babies, cash rules from morn' to dawning

Yeah, Rae, baby, check it out

Feedin' my babies, cash rules from morn' to dawning
Only God is the son of man
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead, oh)
I'ma say this to you one time, and be certain that fake God does not exist
(G-O-D's my reality)
(I'm elevating strong, we're gonna go on to the highest degree)
This is why the universe, by the self-balancing scale of divine knowledge
And it was measured by the portion of solid knowledge
No man can judge for another
(Arm and Leg, Leg, Arm and Head)
But each man must weigh all facts and circumstances
(We've got the powers to resurrect the dead)
And find truth in his own judgment of righteousness
See, the way to evil, balance equality in no man

Rich and Black,Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang,2011.0,"And regardless to how much power you have
When God sends prophets and messengers
They don't care nothing about your power
Because they come from the power

Rare nigga, I'm a wonder
Your best success is my worst blunder
Feds tap the number
Jewelry Jacqueline Onassis could appreciate
Weed to alleviate the pain
Eddie King, Richard Pryor pinky ring
Watch your conduct nigga
Throw parties for my niggas that’s living, you guessed it
Models y'all keep them if they anorexic
Love em but can’t trust them
Hate em but won’t bust them
Caking in savings, spending, wasting
It's like a custom
Tats are hieroglyphics
Lipstick on the collar
I got more to lose than you do but I’m a rider
When did the rules change
Y’all living trendy on pennies
Meeting deadlines with ease, no game
You fire, I'm butane
Gator Timbs, ostrich belts
These be the times that I surprise myself
My niggas looking like black crows and packed shows
The Don voice stay pristine like I'm still seventeen

I'm rich, Black, African
Rocking the golden Mack
Shearling leather, Gucci leg it's on my back
Willie Bosket hoodlum in the trench
Rinse these niggas
'86 Cazals dicing near the fence
Mike Tyson disciple
Trifle with my pen, it's a rifle
Sixteen ways to shoot you through your Chrysler duke
Exhaling with niggas, the jails argue
Bring the best niggas to the table
I'll sic all my whales on you
Custom wooden speakers, rock Elysses, rump on polices
Dump on creatures, holidays and preachers
Stainless steel watches, ostrich turtlenecks
Here's the deal
If we can't come in, they can't have the field
Bones in Cisco', murder instrumentals
Cayenne Porsche rap, how many horses live official
I run with generals who flash Uzis in interviews
My shit is deep, we fly, swiming, dude

Verse two gotta be all murder just like the first verse
Timbs yellow like the hair on a Malibu surfer
Yellow like my Harry Winston glistening arm B
Yellow like New York City piss-stained concrete

That’s right, yo, who voted toasting in the wind
Las Vegas Otis
What you know
Leave it right here we ghost in the Lotus
Put a package on your head, be promoted, keys in effect
Paying these dumb fucking D’s off with donuts

I hate, to see you, acting like a slave
To get an advance here, an advance there
Because somebody else controls your destiny

Aiyo, I’m rich, Black, umbrella calico captain
Wes Craven with a blade and a black
I’m hood ornaments
Junkies win awards in my tournaments
My shit is listed like informants pics
You know we order hits
Planes flying, niggas is sure to get you
Whether in Costa Rica, Lisa, she sure to twist ya
Eating Chow Lo Mein with chopsticks
Glocks with aim
Watermelon chips, pop some ‘pagne
For all the riches
Niggas forcing out they feelings, kid
Whether in hallways or the boats, now feel us, kid
Out in Alaska, in the Astons, remember my passion
Hungry wolf who never eat in his castle
Bolivian connects restless, yeah

Hunted by the FBI

Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump
Troops on the left, fight to the death
Fam on the right, infrared lights
Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what!
Soldiers in the front, let the heat pump

I pop off like a mobster boss
Angel hair with the lobster sauce
Summertime, can't top the scorch
Check my hot broad, I dropped the Porsche
FBI wanna watch the force, tryna lock my source
Where I'm from—hear the macs, Tecs, Glocks and fours
Hide the safe, nigga, lock the doors
No respect for the cops and laws
In the land where your own blood brother still plot for yours
Seen things that'll drop your jaw
My soldiers got dropped in war
See the mural on the project wall?
Won't stop til I cop them all
Wanna block me? You gots to brawl, trade shots and all
'Cause I ain't on the clock for talk
The spot rusher, blow down the spot for sure
Still break off the block with raw, my stock is more
The General: watch your board

Deep pockets with the eight on me, sleep with the safe in the wall
The camo's on with the makeup and all
Swap six 45s, twist reefer in the flicks
Pop your whoadie, ride
Bolt his gun off, from know your whore, she lied
Fly criteria, bury me in Africa
With whips and spears and rough diamonds out of Syria
True don, only I could do wrong
Rock fitted hats, get crack money and drive a sick blue joint
Retard-less, I'ma blow regardless
Résumé is straight up live, I shank niggas up for larger Es
And speak with the youth in the spot
Eat the fresh fruit in the crop; all these hip-hoppers eat cock
You could see me in the street or the yacht
I'd rather be promoting your block
Or buying fresh sneakers with guaps
Yo, I'm an ill dude, always been a real dude
Don't fuck around, I will spill on you and kill you in the field, boo

Troops on the left, fight to the death

Wolves in the back, ready to attack, for what

Leather jackets on, rocked-up rockstars
Treacherous bank robbers, the plan go dub, we pop guards
The team gotta eat, seeds is hungry
That's why we ain't scared to dump on niggas, our guns is chunky
Usually we bust niggas down with bats, swell up they joints
Elbow, wrists, they shins get cracked
We still humiliate, brutalize, Ruger pop, pulverize
Still got gear in the closet that's stupid live
From Benetton rugby skullies
Oshkosh conductor jumpers, the train hats fit me lovely
Rae job is to make sure the coke is fluffy
While I politick his birthday bash with Puffy
Bag me as soon as I linked up, the kid ain't inked up
I'm an old mummy, my gold weigh as much as King Tut
Slippers, robes is minked up (Yeah, ugh)
Under the do-rag, bro, my three-dimensional fade is clean-cut (Yo, yo)

Man, y'all niggas ain't shit to us, still a pistol bust
Split your melon like I split the Dutch (Yeah)
Got a lot of piff to puff, and I ain't come for fisticuffs (Pffff)
Or for the cop that wanna clip the cuffs
Man, is Staten in this bitch or what? Don't get it twisted, we...
Twist it up and even mix with dust
See, these fans can't resist the rush, they Wu-Tang for life
Scarred for life, they can't forget the cuts
Got a whole line of classic joints and while you at it, pass the joint
Let's push this music past the point...
Of no return, til it crash and burn, down the ashes
Then placed inside Ol' Dirty Bastard's urn
When it's my time to go, for sure, your nigga goes to war
What you think I brought these soldiers for?
To send shots like forget-me-nots at any nigga
Respect, bitch, that figure they gon' get me got

You can't move fast enough!
And you don't have enough strength!

Yeah, let's go
Silent King
Yeah
The big park shit
You know how it go
In them alleys
(I'ma holler at you, though)

Since rap got locked right before we visit the '90s
Chef in the kitchen, cooking up with the crimeys
It's late fall, dime season
We bought the crib next to Bill Clinton mother
'Cause she fuck with the Chinese
They hitting niggas with hero'n
It's fourteen of us with Beemers
We won't stop pitching the Chevron
It's packed, kid, Black kids don't know how to act
They flashing Macs, Gillettes, a couple of stacks, yo
The systems is -upid
Yup, shorty with the pumps on
And dunks get provided and scooped, kid
And bloodhounds is hating, they knowing how the kid get down
Silent shottys with grenades, I'm waiting
And everybody love vintage
You see like four, five niggas with half-moons and wave intentions
""What's really good?""
""The 'dro hit 'em, killed 'em in the hotel
Heard he had some old chick with him""

Ghostface Killah

That's how we make it happen, that's how we break it down
Hood all day, nigga, watch how we take the town
That's why we do the do, just know who is who
Acknowledge me all day (
Yo!
), and understand Wu is Wu

But on the other side of town it's Tony, laid up (Ugh)
This white chick want to gargle my nuts
I put the Bailey's down, tap the blunt out
Grabbed her by her hair, watch blondie-love whip my dick out
Spit dripping down my balls, she slobbing me
""That's right! Suck that dick! Get it hard for me""
Pyrex in one hand, 
large amount of grams in it rocked up
And she pregnant, my little man got her knocked up
He popped up (""Oh, shit!"") 
I'm like a crooked cop
Richard Gere
, big smirk on, getting my cock sucked
He pulled the joint out, a bullet spun out, but it was too late
Already nutted on the side of her mouth
Side of her face, and hair like 
Something About Mary
I can't front, my son gun look scary (""Whoa..."")
""Chill! She's a whore!
You knew it from the time we ran trains on her
And you still went and fucked her raw?
Come on, son, give me the gun (""Gimme that!"")
You gonna kill me over this bum-ass bitch you can't resist?
Remember Vel had her in the telly, taking the fist?
Watch how you aiming that shit, you should be aiming at Trish
She take a bone like a ribeye steak at Ruth's Chris
Yo, be easy on the trigger, son, you squeezing the fifth
I only did it just to show you—She's the easiest bitch""
He came close, had to duff him—""Nigga, give me that shit""

That's how we make it happen, that's how we break it down
Hood all day, nigga, watch how we take the town
That's why we do the do, just know who is who
Acknowledge me all day, and understand Wu is Wu

""Fuck your gun, motherfucker. I di—Pull a fucking gun on me again, I'll blow your little balls off. Go to the store and get me a fucking 40 'fore I smack the shit out you, man. Word up.

It's like six in the morning
Me and Miller just finished our pack
Couple fiends on the avenue, they lookin' for crack
Grab the Nextel like yo L, police on the jack
I'm in that wide-body six and I'm sippin' on yak
Blunt of the apple haze got me chilling on lean, back high
Mean like, drive by pumpin' that lean back
Peace out, ridin' the whip
Look at how I'm ridin' my six
Four fifth tucked right on his hip
Some dumb drunk, this nigga has stick
Was parked right on the block
Watchin' us but I ain't peep him and shit
Anyway, back to the story, you steamin' and shit
Pass the piff, we got fiends waitin', fiendin' and shit
Connect got me waitin', fuck, so I'm heated and shit
On the phone cursin' at shorty, ""I'm leavin' you, bitch""
Too much goin' on at one time, I'm dumb high
Seen a group of  tryna run by
This man in a whip, threw the clip and my gun dry
Please cock back, but he spin around one time
 his man comin' by
We're like two more trucks and they creep from behind
Threw it in drive, now Hue ride sick when he high
Pull up  they want us to die
Loose cannons do damage, well I'm dumpin' this 9
Whole clique in the back and we ready to ride

I said I'm fast and I'm furious, headed on the I-95
Ready to ride when I'm blastin', I'm killin' shit

Hey, yo
Got the call from the connect from down bottom
They said they got the squares
And they all for a good price and they solid
Reply 10-4, hung up the horn, got dressed
Waves, rest the best, yes, threw the Franck Muller on
Sophisticated, nothin' flashy, solid king, move like a boss
But the calm flowin' into somethin' nasty
Puffin' on the finest cheeba, green as a rainforest
Doin' a buck on I-95, screamin', ""I live for this,""
They just seen us comin', blew a flat
Pulled over to the shoulder
Pop the trunk to see if it's a spare in the back
A van pulled up, with Florida tags
Three men jumped out with guns drawn and they all wore masks
Snatched me up and handcuffed me
Hit me with the butt of the gun
I'm thinkin' to myself, ""The war just begun""
Thirty minutes in the ride, the mask came off
The chickens dropped, the two in the back had Russian accents
Askin' who my connect is, where he rest shit
You better off squeezin' that tool bitch
He said, ""Nah, you're worth more to us alive than dead.""
He's flashed his badge and started laughin'
""Cocksucker, we the feds""

I need some of that, slide through the back
I need ya'll to come back to the, I heard juice
Back of the store over here, just be easy and tell ya man to be cool
We got some culinary cats right here, we need you we'll kill him if he fault

Aiyo, rappers steppin' to me, they want a brick son
But I'm the Chef, my price is twenty-six son
Move up, about thirty-two of those and open locker dough
Soldier got locked up, blow killed the doctor
Flamboyant police is X fives, watchin' my lofts
So many leeches I just left it and walked
My flow wicked, Miami money, movin' and ridicule
Geico on the arm froze, rose gold with me
Take baths with white women, lingerie see-through
Takin' trips to Iran, my Spanish nigga peoples
Sellin' drugs to Flatbush, call my nigga Cecil
Snub with the black gloves, on half-moon Greek do
Killed him in the Bahamas, his wife ran white van pulled up
They caught him out in Brooklyn with a white man
Slutted out, rosed out, sister was gone, she geekin'
She threw the rifle in her mouth and said good evenin'
Yup, Paul Wall grill line, be getting money, crime thief
I know her from Africa, pretty smile, nine teeth
Gold joints, frames only, Louis Vuitton, pony
Leather with the matching sweater on, you owe me

Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick

Beefsteak Charlie niggas eat and they get fat
Chase heads up and down the block and kill rats
Skilled with the gats, even feds don't know where the shells at
The shell trapped up in nice crib with four packs
Four macs, caught a nice sale for four stacks
Yeah, me and my nigga Arafat
Gotta escape but we'll be right back, real soon
Chef cook it up, we got a date with real goons
Telling you Ghost, my connect crazy with the wet
Might know him used to talk to his sister named Yvette
I speed it up, me and the Linx, was getting weeded up
I beat it up, yeah I hit that, but I ain't seed it up
Meanwhile, back on the block, we seen two trucks
Then the windows rolled down, we see these two fucks
Soon as they jumped out, see these tools bust

Knock the ash off the blunt, confront niggas who cunt
Swing an ax, tax niggas rhyme different from cats
Specialize in mic rippers, splashes
We the last skippers, big rocks and the block will stick

Yeah, yo, I lit a boogah up, rocks is gone, so we baggin' up all shape
Binoculars, scanners, we all listen to jake
Ran out of baggies, my mouth is dry
Got them dirty joints that scatter, don't act surprised
Nah, nigga the currency rushes like popping a wheelie
Holding a pipe with one hand, the other countin' the billies
You know how it be with the peppermint Clarks, throwing darts at a hoodrat
Getting slow neck up in The Bronx
That's all me, thirty four shines, forty four lines
I just chill like Aaron Hall, writin' raw rhymes
Like, threw Kool-Aid rubies in a lemonade bezzle
When I was twelve in the church, I started packin' that metal
A deuce-deuce, my supplier was Loose Bruce
Ever since I had the drop, my instinct was to shoot-shoot
This ain't For the Love of Ray J, it's for the love of the AK
Cuz you can get 
scratched like AJ
Cuban Link Dynasty has emerged, this rap shit stop
I have a team of niggas moving my furs

Anthrax pussy, the minks, whiskey king
Wrote my name on her face, yeah, yeah, kush me
Elevation keep the arm clustery, thousands of guns
We got money too, and we know how to fight someone
But niggas get burned and sodomized
Chopped into a capsule, amass cool, I'm that live
Yeah, shower that nigga down, he pussy
Tryna hang with wolves, yo, you still plain pussy
Don't ever move, we'll detonate

Really need a crown on my head like a catholic
Never been a bitch and I don't plan on startin'
Blood gang, beat a beat like Pam on Martin
And you wonder why my right hand man stand-offish
'Cause he got that blam blam on point like swordfish
I'm walkin' 'round the mansion on a cordless
Arguin' with a bitch 'bout how I cannot be her boyfriend
And then I told her, ""Hold on, let me click over""
It was my homie T, 'bout to bring them bricks over
We 'bout to break 'em down like when hammers hit boulders
If one of us goes down then we keep our lips frozen
Who that nigga with, Blood? Make that nigga spit blood
Bullet ain't got no name but the nigga that it hit does
Come through in my bitch's car, shoot you with my bitch's gun
She asked where I've been, I just had to make a quick run
I'm an NWA, nigga with an AK
That'll put an end to the melee
Smokin' on pounds 'til them shits just deadweight
Ben Franklin straitjacket, my money gon' stay straight

Who gave you crime action stories, live from the bricks?
Now it's more diamonds, more bread, more bitches, more head
More land to cover and haters get more lead
Monster rap, decorated, general stripes, I'm top rank
Raise your arm up, salute the globe's most realest still
M16 rounds from 16s
Blood money over here, cash rules daily
Flip train, lay it down flat, call it a G language
Keep flamin', sophisticated killers that's rich and famous
For actin' like your bakery bakes stacks
Get your cake snatched, and your pride too
Money can't replace that
Run but you can't hide
The games that you play'll get you viewed by a coroner, coward
This is my corner

Dedicated goons understand it's high stakes

It's a cold world
Surely weather with the V bombs and leathers
With the fur on the collar
We 'bout major dollars
See the hoes, they holla
When they eat us and swallow
Cause we them dime dadas
Get them top shoppers
Eyes on us, death to those that lied on us
And love for ever for all my soldiers that cried for us

Lame niggas fall back in our presence
Bow down to the king, when you see me, nah mean
I ain't playing with you
Yeah, you gonna take one for the team
Fucking dog crying, ever seen a grown man scream

You tacky like head rest TVs
Your value drop, you not worth these
Bacon strips we gets, you stay broke
We stay leaning in new red Rolls
Smoke stack lightening, coming out the crack black window
That's us getting high, letting things go
We getting it, the money don't stop
Beef don't cease, the drama gonna pop
Soon as we step in the spot, shots on me
Line 'em up, kill every single bottle they got
The drama gonna pop like the pipe bomb
Hyper, the son don't chill, Allah
You get burned, try and dap me

I think it was the year '89
He stayed the freshest, Polo boots
Wallys with them colorful 'Lo gooses
Coming from Medina
, we boost
We up in A&S, slipping and dipping to Bedstuy
Native, he used to beatbox, thousands would listen
Yo, that's before, the Wu got on
Him and Allah Just' and RZA
 came to the Island one morn'
A nigga could dance to slow music, outdrink any nigga
On the benches, while we hitting reefer, he sold loosies
Five-foot-seven, a legend was born, Russell 'Ason"" Jones
I know him for his braids and lessons
A wise man with knowledge 120
Kept a flag on his chest
A right hand, you quick, serving you Remy
Yo, let's toast to the fallen, lost forgotten
Aiyo, if niggas could hear me, then roll up some broccoli
Ason, the heart of a lion, a purified mind
The way he did it, with a mic and some wine
I would never forget the days we used to sit back
Days I be all up in the crib, listening, holding, align him and yo
I just miss this nigga
And now, I understand the meaning of love when I kiss the nigga

My name is Ol' Dirty Bastard, you know what I'm saying? I don't hide nothing back. I barely—I mean, I come from a family, man, of poor welfare, you know what I'm saying? When I came out my mother's womb, I was on welfare, you know what I'm saying?
So—So—So, it's like, you got to keep it real, know what I mean?

Loud as the ferry

best friend was Mama Cherry
Sweet lady, BK baby
She taught Dirty how to cook, clean, singing the songs
Say the old school dances and O.E., Ballantine, the wine
We sip, while we sat with the O.G.'s
Knowledge of self, good health
The fortunes that came with the game had my brother insane
It's like wealth ain't enough to live for
But if you got love in your heart, just believe in yourself
That was the Black man rap, baby Jesus in the black land
Few jewelry pieces with his gold fangs, his fam
(
""Brooklyn Zoo!""
) you know my brother was ill
The first dude to say, ""Yo, keep it real""
Yeah, the lover, the father, the hustler, the rap professor
Now, he with Allah, that's a blessing

See, it's like, ok, where I come from
In my neighborhood, my people know me
You know what I'm saying? See, if I try to come any different
They ain't gon' respect me no more
You know what I'm saying? Because they -- you know people
Got their thing about themselves, you know
If you come from the neighborhood, you know what I'm saying?
You couldn't, you couldn't get out the neighborhood
But you could never take the neighborhood out of the people
You know what I'm saying, but if you try to like jump and crossover
To the other side, people won't understand that, and they don't like that
That's why they don't be buying people music
See, we keeps it real, and we always gon' keep it real
You can't knock what's real, You know what I'm saying? We telling the truth, man",https://genius.com/Raekwon-ason-jones-lyrics

Killing time, making a name
Wasn’t about money or the fame
Why hide the scars?
It’s who we are
It’s who we are

Purple cloths is on me, salute my presence
DNA is worth a fortune but I've still seen a life of peasants
I gave y'all style, taught you how to be fly, go 'head and grace the sky
Gave you wings to soar like you ought to
Forever may not exist in the flesh but my music will
All praises due to the Most High
With my toast, shocked the world, wasn't Casper when I said
I came through when the roaster blow in half a Billy Goat
Just because I'm living this life I'm accustomed to it
Floating in them fly cars, damn I'm supposed to do it
Pretty women fall in love with my expensive taste, luxury, lust
Physical touch by this ace, handcuff 'em
That's a no no 'cause I don't trust them far as I can throw those
Gold diggin' vixens who's in love with the coco
But fuck it, you know I'm here for this dough though
Let's pop another bottle of Don and watch our gross grow
I love it

Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasn’t about money or the fame
Why hide scars?
It’s who we are
It’s who we are

Clarity stones in my bracelets, watches and rings
From a rich nigga's perspective you know what that brings
Hatred, what do I do when I'm so used to shittin' on 'em
Do I stop because a jealous ass coward wants me to
Or do I go harder and buy more diamonds and blind his crew
Fuck it, I guess I do that 'cause I love to make 'em blue
Getting 'em bags,  stayin' fly, stayin' high
Do what I wanna, no more strugglin' just to get by
Yes, fresher than a new born baby's ass
New money, got my ex wishin' she was never in my past
I laugh, enjoy these fruits from my labor
But still feel the strain and pain that be from my labor
Spent my time to achieve all of the fortune and fame
And for myself makin' a name
But deep inside I try to cover up the scars to be a shinin' star
I guess that's just who we are

Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasn’t about money or the fame
Why hide scars?
It’s who we are
It’s who we are

Forever may not exist but who else is as hot as this?
I played the beat then I tried at this
Cuban links on my neck and I just put a presidential on my wrist
This year you haters gonna acknowledge this
It's G-Rapo and Raekwon, told the homies this wouldn't take long
My verses always just as real as the true story it's based on
Chopped the blow on the table plenty times
In the lines that she puts her face on
And this is not by accident
Anything can happen if you simply imagine it
My OG put a torch to the blunt then he's passin' it
Believe in something, stand for it or take a knee and stand like Kaepernick
Anything to get the point across makin' a statement
You'll only go as far as you take it
20 years later and we're still slappin' that purple tape shit
Greatness so close I can taste it, face it

Forever may not exist
But man do we got our moments
Killing time, making a name
Wasn’t about money or the fame
Why hide scars?

And keep it true

As reaper stay sprayed, still niggas is smoked
Four in his pocket, a diamond'd-up chain and some coke
Champion hood, the goodies in a brown bag, by the radiator
Near the cookies and the bundles of dope
Fishscalers, I live in elevators and gross
All this paper, profit make her lay there and post
With them Adidas that Bruce wore, stay in the juice bar
All I know, if you saw me, you thought I was broke, Black, yo

Fifty deep in the lobby, large, rocking camouflage
Dark Caesar holding my nuts, played the building front
Fifth of Henny, throw a little snow in the blunt
Just growing up, schooled by OGs, holding Os and up
Daily, new drama unfold—""They popped him over what?""
It's so rough—nobody know him, so what?
""Ayo, the money's close by, homie, show me the stuff""
Borough-hopping, copping bricks, bags, burners, and kicks
City slickers, circling the strip, working them tricks
Like Friday night, cruise in the coupe, new volure suit
Fruit-flavored kicks, taking flicks out in 40-Deuce
Farmer jeans, hammer swing, tucked in the loop
How they hit Ms. Fisher, they was busting that suit
Up in 54, underground, parrot and Q
Made man with the grey shams, wrapping the boo
Stay flam, every day, fam, stacking my loot
Eighty grams in the cake, bam, packages flew
Sipping passionfruit, Alizé, 
in back of The Ooh

Bake cakes, hundred dollar bill holders
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers
Bighead, I thought I told you
We soldiers, boy, we soldiers

Old men gossip with tales, you know?
Police burners with bodies on 'em, bury 'em
Worry for minutes then we fire them (blaow!)
I see firemen, ambulances, narcotic mansions
So melodic, rock chronic, pop tonic scramblin
See all these niggas into gamblin - yo
Just give me square feet, uniquely I'm handlin niggas
Done danced with niggas, plus yo, threw niggas in vans
Left him on trains, his veins got ham in 'em
Take a message, he ran, it was a quarter to four plan
He had me on the floor with my man
We both drugged out, scholars with grams
Tri-colored rocks, follow the hands, full sorrow in plans
Make one false move you blam
Eh yo take the globe right out of ya land
We broke out in Iran

Eh yo it's eight million stories in the city
Niggas actin' shifty, Ice Water back on the grizzly
Brand new handgun that hold about fifty
It's a new boss in town like Mauseberg Mickey
Eight million stories and six is from the hood
A real live hustler up to no good
They needed more yae-yo to ease they habit
They said we fell off, the streets don't believe you faggots!

Where all the wolves live, sub-machine guns and big beamers
Yo circle the crib, you see teamsters that try you again
Little niggas is blind, the nines fly out and slap a few men
That's mine, let up off 'em again
Take seventy more shots, the remedy, Wu through the fence
This bench God, lays in gents
Eh yo pop the head off right under the tents
This is more current events, pay attention
The legend is here, as long as you know him he coffins ya men
What? Bulletproof pimps, big hammers, multiple flips
As long as it's bread, you know you was hit
Eh yo let that stack get rinsed
Play the back, sharp as a fuck, ownin' my own shit
Grown niggas get moments to vent
Give 'em the real Lex Diamond Story, welcome 'em in",https://genius.com/Raekwon-pit-bull-fights-lyrics
Shaolin vs Wu Tang,Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang,2011.0,"Master!
*sounds of fighting*
Toad style
.. hmmph
The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord
To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting!
The Shaolin would never do that!
Wouldn't you? The Shaolin have always looked down at us
Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you?
You?
So you used your Shaolin poison to set up my master and deliberately frame me!
That's nonsense!
It's not nonsense! I saw it myself!
Nonsense! The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang but our swordfight

Aiyo! Come on! Let go of the ratchet, son, come on, let's go! Come on!

paintbrush

Ostrich turtlenecks

She on, and we up, let's re-up, and free'd up
Jakes hate it, Rae made it, Clientele, we gon' sell
You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales
Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved
We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real
Old records, old luggage, you ill with no rugged
You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards
We love it, can't stand it, you hid, the 
The Wu Manual
We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling

Hold your fire!
You two traitors!
You've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang
No, we have not, it's just that they're the same
That's right, my Lord
You misunderstand our kung-fu work
It doesn't belong to anybody, IT EVOLVES!

Marvin,The Wild,2017.0,"April 2nd 1939, the stars is in line
Divine intervention at it's own intention
Birthed a gift, in this DC kid, he sung heavenly
Good values and all and his father was in the ministry
God fearing man with a mother that's so beautiful, the angels would serve her
What's her name? It's Alberta
This little boy quickly became a man
From blowing in his father's church, to making his own band
Called the Moonglows, sensational with his vocals
That drove the ladies crazy, panties got thrown at his shows
But he was far from happy, he wore a smile just to hide it
Behind them doors him and his father constantly colliding

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

Destined for greatness, counting his blessings
Young'uns struggling with pressures
That the fact that his pops was a cross dresser
But he still loved him, you know the bond between his son and father
That only pushed him and forced him to sing harder
His main man Harvey Fuqua gassed up his car
Believed his sound
And took him down to Motown y'all
That's where it all happened
Success in the palm of his hand
But unfortunate the fame wasn't enough
He wanted more out of life
Took it further and found himself a wife
Pretty 
Anna Gordy
, she made his time sit still
She was the cousin of 
Barry G, the founder of Hitsville
Please pay attention because the story it gets ill
Shit's real, trials and tribulations son's facing
You gotta play the cards you're dealt
Ain't no telling what life deals
Death will cause you to have night chills
Enough to keep a nigga bothered
Especially when the negatives start coming from your father

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

Money, women and drugs came into play
Now wouldn't you know, there goes another happy home down the drain
That night life had him speeding through hell
Scarred by the death of Tammi Terrell
Couldn't believe it, he spiraled downhill
Secluding himself, from the music and the press
He was sick and really getting depressed
Time passed so he bounced back on track
New and improved
Even got himself a new wife too
Everything is on the up and up, got his act together
Spiritually he claims, you could see the glow up on this fella
Tried to make amends with his father
But the hatred is too strong, revolver in his palm
The warning that death was close
His mother screaming out ""Honey don't do it!""
One shot to the chest made Marvin lose fluids
April 1st he died on the spot the scene was so horrific
How a father could kill his own son defines wicked

Marvin, the sound of your voice
Sets fire to my soul
What a glory to behold
Marvin, my heart, my heart still wonders how
I just hope you're happy now

It's the sound of the music

Masters of Our Fate,Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang,2011.0,"Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been is, is not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!
Salvation will not be denied us!
Salvation will not be denied us!
We are the masters of our fate!
As long as we have faith
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!

The time has come, I just begun, this is designer rum
My wallet got flowers on it, killer cowards from milan
The stolen land where gold chains control a man
300 holdin hands, stolen grams
I play the fan, and wave and leave that nigga for dead, or should I save him?
Spittin out phlegm, no, just grave him
I remember days I used to work for niggas, eat jerk with niggas
Buyin whippids, laughing at jokes and try to flip
Clip is loyal, fly spoil on the block, display royal
Even though we go back to royals, black oils
Live as ever, can’t tell me nothing
Whatever this thing of ours is empowered by my niggas who pumping
24 hours of sling motion, wave brush
Ya'll knew my hair was the ocean
Running through the building just nego-tion
Some of the creeps knew me very well
Knew he would sell, knew he was potent

Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been is, is not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!

Ok, bridges I burned some, lessons I learned some
Money I spend some, lent some, earned some
My eyes tell a tale of the hell I returned from
Spark up a L for the homies I haven't heard from
Burn when the urge come
I’m living lurge(large)
Never chilling on the curb, just a villian on the verge, son
My tenth shot is as official as the third one
Second one, first one
Worse come, the worst run
When I was pushed out of the womb the earth spun
The only way to describe this is inertia
Some rappers think they could try me, Who the first up?
I don’t guarantee no survivers, nigga surfs up
Yeah, soul on ice, courage and sacrifice, hold on tight
And save your laughter for the afterlife
These chumps thinkin they good, ain't even half as nice
Your fate will be a one-way ticket to paradise

Now we are the masters of our fate
That the task that which has been is, is not above our strength
That its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance
As long as we have faith in our cause
And unconquerable will power
Salvation will not be denied us!

Ain’t nothin', just swimmin' in life you know
It’s all good and shit man, word up man
So yo, you go around the corner
You got nourishment over there, waiting for you, man
The other dude, youknowhatimsayin’
Tell U Bar Allah, I said, what’s good
Who was up in the spot last night

Word to the gold Panameras and to the wood grain in my Lambo
I go the extra mile, my flow scaffolds
Crew cuts, the older niggas, the game rumors, just the same goons
When niggas catch visions for killing capos
Palestinian armor, golden rocket launcher, my aunt
She copped it for me, bought it in Rwanda
See demon schemin', niggas get live in the Beacon
I’m shaw to shank shit up like Morgan Freeman
Pussy getting rapper, rich nigga, one-on-one rents niggas
And incidents, my fingerprints been tore up
We sell love slingin' like Siemens, the snort-able Beemers
They love callin' niggas names out, you screamin'
Feds try to trap us and plus tap us, niggas’ll grab us
Throw you in the rassle, yo, clap ups
Catch me at the Stephen King mansion
With four of my Branson niggas
With me, me and Britney, a dancer
Know your shit authentic by the way your hat fit on you, with it
I’m like the Blair Witch nigga in the rented
Curtains in the five-seven, chunky and short
Baggin' dope up in the backseat, your package's walk
Holdin' my girl wedding ring, she Medellin
Name is Beretta King, live in Alpharetta and she never leave me
Flow freely this is all graffiti, the cloth we cut from
Is straight from a rich nigga, greedy

Yo, Scarface gangstas, criminal niggas up in the trenches
Army coats on, playing the benches
Getting paper, sly, that’s the motto, intelligent goons
Inside a hundred thousand dollar whip, follow

It's the Vacheron Don! Su Wu-Tang!
Still gritty, leave the pretty to the females
The watch mother pearl with the seashells
Pick of the litter, have this nigga picking paper up
Twitter thug, I’m the timeline strangler
Get ‘em up, banging dangerous as angel dust
Cuban Linx smokin' stink in the Brink’s trunk
I run with killas who snort powder, extort cowards
Ankle monitors under garments, so fuck showers
I give a fuck what you talking ’bout
Mob meetings, we them only niggas walking out
Sparkin' purple once a nigga done spaghetti slurpin'
Fly away in my new, Scaglietti surfin'


Yo, we in the back roasting marshmallows
Bottles of Krug
The dialogue is the big chain niggas is rude
Law library scholars, potatoes over the thirty-eights
With bald-heads, all live wires
Eleven homes, six trust funds, came home from doing a dime
We just left Un’s, straight up
And we standing over the stoves, in denim Gibaurds
Brought a Dairy Queen to Queens right next to Lowes
IMAX Theatres
Astoria Waldorf
Philip Drummond suite, pretty young thing suckin' my balls off
Bubble baths, hash, zooted up, eyes closed
Silk drawers, fronting in my key-lime pie Wallo's
And I still got a half a ki indeed, Frank Lucas shit
Hid it in coffins, flying over seas
And if you ever try to ruin my knight
I’ma make sure my best pawn put like three in your kite
Shot caller, laying in big lofts
Rock of Gibraltar, my pinky joint, killing like Orca
Daytime hawker, a nasty street author
Me, Rae and Rick, uzi’d out in the porches
Case we gotta Warner bro, like Malcolm-Jamal
I’ma Falcon, Seven Mike Vick with the ball
Cause I can hut-one, hut-two, disrespect
I hunt you down
Ain’t a muthafuckin' crew we can’t run through

Soak my bullets in cyanide

No kind a background, claimed killer, then who did you shoot?
Must've imagined that, with your far-fetched raps
Shit is real over here, til' we blast on Satan
Take trips in and out a the country
Turn dark clouds to sunny, I'm livin' good, my paper got me comfy
You in the hood talkin' bout you wanna war with me
I get your projects shot down while your land lord sleep
Now you in too deep, no turning back from your actions
You a killer then show me, if not, then meet my savages

While I'm ditecting a German, hateful niggas, chicks be swallowing
And if you look funny to me, and there's a problem then
I put you under an ultraviolet light or a halogen
As if I was busy deciphering counterfeit dollars and
Hoes in like some kind of Biblical figure, King Solomon

Newports are $7.50, a box of Huggies is off the meat rack
She's back, thirty days, she relapsed
Our troops need to leave Iraq
And rap niggas need to go on strike so we can get more cash
'Cause...

When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice
When it's cold outside, and the rain turn to ice

Said mama's out here flipping out, shots just going off
Somebody laid out, little kids smoking weed
Drive-bys every day, wonder what's going on
Here outside with my motherfucking AK

Oh, ho
What I'm gonna deal when it's cold outside?
High, high
Ah, ah, oh, oh

Ridin' the married boots, take care of me, sincerely
I'm Israeli, machettes is cris, swish some Baileys
Snuggled up, mink on, call it a cover up
Just like two murders in the hood, I'mma double up
The rap surgeon fix the game up, crack merchant
Everything I sell is well, my shit is that worthy
GATs that come up out the ceiling with the beam on it
Chinese Queen, Parasuco jeans on her
Rock long jeans, known for throwing blings on her
I stay king, by any means scream on it nigga

Come on, let's go nigga
Word up, close the door to the Aston nigga
Yo, get out the, take that shit out the ash tray man

Do you remember a real gang member?
Choppin' til he timber, December to December
Never stoppin', too busy poppin' off lead in the heat
Clownin' ass all around him, they crown him the Dogg Father
Glock hot, crock pot on the block with a chef
Out of bounds on the grounds with a hole in your chest
Invest in back in feedback, gorilla the west
Take a whiff of me, spliff, till it fill up my chest
Convertible with the Cadillac, mackin' the mack
With some Roscoe's Chicken in my lap, imagine that
I'm groovin' down Sunset Boulevard
No harm, no foul, no body guard

Yo, stop right there man
You don't know what you're doin' man
Chill, chill, let them handle that man for real

Chill yo, the movie is scary
Take off the sheep skin shotty
Nigga make a move, and don't dare me
I'm blessed with these million dollar hands, I'm like poker
Niggas screw they motherfuckin' face, so what?
Guns are collected, flips perfected
Boats flying in, every brake's inspected
The clique's connected, everybody wrist and neck lit
Two shots of Cisco, let's slip
Post like Scarface and Sosa with my memosa
All that motion, see my billiongs posted and roastin'
See my villains most of them roastin'
Freshmen chickens get close in 'em
Make one move, she buyin' me the Ghost in it

Pass the dutchie
You know what it do man
We in Wonderland huh

Stealth but get loud like a space shuttle
Catch a case, a motherfuckers got a place for you
And it's 100 brothers like you that's cold with the Typhoo
Slang and things and buck 50 with the jinzu
Draw that line, flip that dime, spit that nine
Homie this Crip on mine

We cold crushin' bum rush the chef, it's my nephew
The king of the west too, niggas to test you

Aiyo, aiyo

I grew up on the foul side, nickel bag vial side
Purple tops, two for fives
I had seven grams, outside with my eleven mans
On the corners with a pocket full of contrabands
Running up and down fire escapes, NARCs coming
Jump in the window, let your Nikes fly, hide the flakes
Guess up in the Hill it was real to me
What a nigga would of did if you steal from me
All my life around drug niggas, villains who want millions
Niggas with them hoodies on, with techs in the building
Mad fiends, bags of green, Gillette razors
Fly neighbors, all live blazers, designer jeans

Pacing, from here to L.A., and Hawaii and Cuba
Blew new uzi too, serial numbers is brail
So when you rub against it feel all twos
Now I'm with some special niggas
Next level niggas with rubble bezzles
Who drive Exeleros with jewels
Brolic boots on, olive Goose, calamari soups and noodles
That spell out, ya'll niggas the truth
What it is baby boy, reclining in the big Benz

And cock blocked but can't stop the official, what

Yo god, remember back in the days god?
When we came a long way and shit, man (no question)
We supposed to be blessing each other
On our physical days and shit, you know what I'm saying?
It's like basically, I wanna hit my family with like land and all that
Diamonds and all that, we ran through that chamber dun

Mainly stack mine, indeed it's been a long time
Let me feed y'all, fruits of life, shut up and eat y'all
Flavors for neighbors, Wallee's down to gators
The whole configuration stacking paper
Yo we do this, on the low though
If so, we running John Dolo
First thing, you need if you don't know
We carry cause it's a real world, show and prove
In ill words, all my herbs know the slurge
Dress nasty like fuck, keep my bird on the job yo
You got to straighten up
Do the worst thing to hurt her heart, damn
Took care of that, shared, even shed a tear for that
Bust my gat to throw gear on her back
Damn son, why she taking you through that?
She's a part of me, pardon me flow Allah, we sworn we
Wising up, take care of home bases
Then we slide to another part and start more hatred
Life is sacred - the other side of that paw, you lie naked
Clothes in the box, go 'head take it
Flash back Jew status
Salute moms and get ya boots splattered
Batting average, your moms had it
Just a broke young dumb, full of cum ready to haunt something
Takes something of yours, here you want something
Growing up around fifteen
Watching how the big niggas rolling wit big cream
Big schemes
Quick to flash your gat, laser beam
Pool table action black, hundred stacks made my niggas leave
Some be saying ""Let em breathe""
The others wanna deceive
How we gonna make it if we don't achieve?
Right now, catch it from a vertical degree yo
We starting showing our asses, committing burglaries
One got caught, threw us all off
Threw us in the hell section near the boardwalk
Wondering how the sword talk, did he fall off?
Did he stand like the hawk that he was in New York?
Kept the waves spinning on the cross, of course
Come back a little cutty endorse
Risked it for his kids the pain is lost
We sitting back on a better note, yelling ""Peace god
I love you love you to death, you thoroughbredable""
The Robbin Hood of the hood
Sit back, it's all good
Won't spoil it if we call it, we all hood, ha ha

I make knowledge born to save self, you know?
Who gon' live it, gon' live it
Be is to be a born, know what I mean?

Soaked in degrees of knowledge, polished by sun rays
Carving by nine swordsmen
To a needle point of perfection
It's a blessing to deliver this lesson
While traveling the planet, extending development
And vote for the mind
Never ended we now send it long-winded

Shoes forbidden in the crib, especially on my Alaskan polar bear rugs
Pictures with billies and parties out in Ibiza

High ceilings, 18th century paintings is basic
With litters of money, many casinos in the basement
A million letter way a nigga parlay
With money to wrinkle your face up like a Shar Pei
Limited box of cigars from diplomats in Cubana
Rare art of Basquiat feeding fruit to Madonna
Copacabana, I'ma celebrate 'til they respect a
Success story with trucks unloading imperial nectar
Too many whips, I built a valet

Dancing and swinging like a ballet

Legend in the flesh and I rep New York
Crowned king, been down to bang, I'm House Gang
Knockout specialist, in and out the ring
Got dinner tables long as boats with old kitchens
And Wu-Tang logos splashed on all the dishes
You know how I speaks the truth, how I teach the youth
I'm an animal, I beast the booth
Been grinding, banging out for food to eat
Your boy still eating good, check my new physique
Since the world is mine, I'ma write my name on the clouds
So that all yee faithful, can praise it and bow

Now he's an old Mafia don, from back when
He managed to survive the game, ducking fame
It's how he maintained, the State of Grace, kept his lab laced
Ladies of a fine taste, kept his place guarded
While the young charted, found acquitted, all charges
And his heart loss and, marksmen take the contract
From the contact, waiting for the right event, it all made sense
He left no prints on the weapon, and he was blasting
Came home from prison stashing, still stacking
His whip still matching his kit, steel flashing
Hands quick, nice with his shit, three holy foods drops jewels
From a street corner level, young brother, I'ma rebel
Here to instruct private soldiers to buck arms
Y'all rap cats had your last win, toast the kings
It's Wu-Tang, it's our thing, kiss the ring

When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it
When I step inside, kiss the ring, Wu Familia
La Cosa Nostra, it's our thing
So salute, and toast to the best who done it
Murder rap shit, I spit, for the vets who love it",https://genius.com/Raekwon-kiss-the-ring-lyrics
Casablanca,Immobilarity,1999.0,"Stop touching the fucking door man
You so fucking paranoid man
What's the matter with you man?
It's like a nigga could write for hours
And get real theatrical wit' this
Understand? Telling you kid
I got stripes when it comes to this right here
Y'all know my repertoire
It's dangerous, and the cats I roll with is dangerous
And they ain't your regular average cats
Here we go

A-yo; It's all elegance
He spoke third power style high intelligence
A young man handle the game like Merrill Lynch
3 A.M. breathing, leaning in gates
I mean creaming
Selling these cakes in slabs like Land O' Lakes
Fiends beaming, steaming
Associated with names and demons
All apparent reasons
We live here the gate blew in a year
Sort of like time share where crime, sport it like I shine yeah
Rainbow dough was the M.O
So many flavors yo
Buy your neighbor off underwater vault
Then I met him, Colombian name Flako
Had the whole block locked selling tons in Morocco
Wristwatch Vacheron Constantin - nigga dead up
Sniff the rawest mist mixed wit 7up
Had a black wiz spoke German
Higher learning burning
Ask Vernon got a bed set bought a black jet
Bitch large percentage on her rich motor lodge
Lost her arm, shot with a AK up in the south
Paramedics rocked her
Said she had connections out Anartica
Barrels of juices from Florida
Can't forget live dusthead centerfoldin
Out in Club Med butt ass laying like she dead
Wise guys fell for her ambiance
Pull it together, black renaissance Queen Elizabeth aunt
Crazy swift Cristal murderer
Guzzle the shit like she dying kid
Showing off her diamond
Flashbacks now it's me and him again
Last word I caught
'Put your money in we could have the shit bumping
That's federalo music
I caught the glimpse from the bitch
When she winched yeah Santa a grinch
She blinked twitched her nose then froze
Check your Rolls by the blow
It's time to roll nigga let's go
I thought about it broke the money down
What's the total count it, no count it over
In the mix day going slower
Nope not time to motor
He estimated over me
Not being a crook, count it over
Yo only on the strength of my man
We ain't hit him with the strong hand
Gun him down leave him out in flatlands
He backhand smacked her
Threw her on the table jacked her
I broke out in laughter fifteen minutes after
Police knocked on the door
Looked out the window of my room
As your, nigga yeah that's yours
He opened up the door this nigga wilding
His bitch is in shock
Start smiling and speaking on Valen
Yo wisen up bitch this from the rich
Immobilize the game get your name right
Envelope came hype
Regards from the mayor you hype
Fuck right, lets fuck this money up
And get large and blow outta sight
 (x2)
Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
Who you gon' choose - me or him? - you a fool
Pay attention, fuck around meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen

Wise niggas wake up, dead niggas lose
... you a fool
Pay attention, fuck around meet the tension
See you in the next dimension, y'all niggas didn't listen

Snake Pond,Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang,2011.0,"Very good!
Who are you?
We are from the Wu-Tang
Shaolin's the foundation
From which all kung-fu springs
Buddha's name be praised

I met him by Snake Pond, my hand on the flamer, my bomb
I park, Rae, Ghost, then lit up the bong
It's nightfall, nothing here, nothing to fear
Just got things to touch on, then he walked up weird
Walked in frail as stale, his eyes were soft
His face was pale, I looked at him kneel
Just wanna talk, you a deer, starting chasing him
He jumped in the tree, had grass in his ear
I'mma kill you nigga, you gonna have to come down
Little did he know I was a leader, a full bred eater
Jump in new V's, shopping, had the fever
Next stop Starbucks and Spiegels, Jags had diesel
Then she walked in, fly little diva
Niggas on the scheme for your gleam, they come from your school
A bunch of snake bites, they bitch smacked Shareen
She slid in the '09 Beemer, with that sex whore Sabrina
Forging checks, live in Medina
Thanks for the info, my kinfolk, listen, Miss Window
With the big pimple on her temple
Any more knowledge is college, you gave enough to be bounced now
She shot up in Chipotle, don't quote me
917, 646, you know it's war, bitch, can't dress for nothing, she fronting
Took a piss, roll up, let's twist, pulled down my pants
Good look, and shot through her tits
Now I gotta picture who I'm looking for, fake ass Brooklyn boy
I know his fucking family, fuck 'em all
I used to love brothers, now I hate 'em
Mostly them gator boys, who stunting and they never seen nathan
Me and my real soldiers who started it, won't play part of it
But I'mma get to the bottom, I got 'em
Newspapers saying they shot 'em, but on the low
I heard he shot himself
A trip, yo, the poison me, I come from the poison bees
Where mothers run old nightclubs with tons of ki
Old lady holding them G's, dope fiends, holes in they jeans
Magicians that can make blow green
I know his whole team, no craze, dough so low
I hit 'em off mean, now he wanna hold me, no bro, B",https://genius.com/Raekwon-snake-pond-lyrics
We Will Rob You,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II,2009.0,"""Who in the hell teaches you kung fu?
Your master must be an ignorant idiot as well!""
(Uncle Ricky, would you read us a bedtime story?)
Nah, kid, but I'mma give you one them old Raekwon crime joints
Feel me? We will, we will
We will, we will—here we go

Well it was late one night, walking through the park
With my leathered down coat and Wallabee Clarks
Getting my step on, big shit, big six, big wrist
So much excitement in the air, I was crisp
Money suitcase, Louis joint
(yo, Rae, I'mma get some shit just like yours!)
Go make it happen, black God and get rich
Saw the D's fly by, in a New Yorker, yup, tints and shit
They made a right on me, them last two dicks
Know I seen 'em, Max loaded, jog right back to the car
They spun around again and blast their shit
I dropped a Backwood, a puff and then a 6-4-5
You'se a live nigga, you almost smashed your shit
I'mma don my way out the bitch, moving through the car
Nice and slow, two hoodies on and a golden pit
Nigga had a white eye, they both blacked down
What's the clown shit for? The dog jumped in the whip
It was a trained one, wops pointed at me (yo, nigga, freeze)

I told the Chef Raekwon, pump the brakes
Slow it down, you know these C-Cypher Punks scanned your plates
Release the seatbelt off the shoulders, a mile ahead
Then the vibe got a lot colder when the marksman said
""Black niggas in the Jeep, get the fuck out the car""
Put your hands where my eyes can see or suffer a scar""
He was a veteran, who kept, pepper spray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, thirty eight brandisher
On top of that, the blunt smoke just rang a bell
Of his bloodhound who had an acute sense of smell
Beef tripping, saliva dripping from razor sharp teeth
That was pointy as the daggers of the Indian Chiefs
Same cops known for extorting pimps and booking whores
Aimed Glocks at me and Rae, cause they was looking for
A few MCs wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen, wearing long minks and snakeskins

We will, we will, rob you
We will, we will, Glock you
We will, we will, what? who? (not you)
Here we go

You know my Clan done ran from Japan to Atlanta with stamina
Peace to Chef, Mr. Meth
Move it on your left, with the Iron Lung breath
Ghostface Kill', U-G ill
Deck so real, Dr. Ason Unique, the medic
Ahh, Allah Just, The Abbott, y'all niggas can't forget it
You might catch a Cap if your shit ain't Street
Allah Mathematics make the cypher complete
See knowledge is the foundation of existence
To know starts the spark of the flow
Wisdom activation of the Nation moving
Wise words, show and prove or understand the 13 letters
And the Masta, culture be the way of life
Freedom is reward, who will pay the price for the power
Spending hour after hour, preparing his self
For the hour, now look how refined
When the mind and body is one, every part of me
Supreme equality, manifest the nature of self
G-O-D, now build and add on to the truth
Destroy the bullshit, born incomplete",https://genius.com/Raekwon-we-will-rob-you-lyrics

Swimsuit mammal get high, float flammable
Drop off in a Benz boat lampable

Nikki Barnes gon' lynch me
What, fruit flavored nikes
Benz 2000 the hype piece
Send half my love out to white peeps
Wu-Tang emblem, success, make a nigga tremble
Nine of us stand, nine resemble
Filling out tax reports
Look live up in Guess shorts
Bitches got love and support
Yo, leather jacket, yellow
Leather hat, mack it real mellow

Multimillion dollar mansions manufactured  mud

My method is meditative musical medicine
With sergeant mentality mechanisms

I’m medicated materials methane meet the master massive
Y’all monkeys no match, make a mistake and get mauled by this mamba
Movin’ with the mobsters of Molotov
When I mingle in a midnight, moments are muggy

Advise y’all nerves to be neutral, all of that nonsense

Move like a running back, 21 Tomlinson
Know how to push it back, you should pay homage and
Shit is too potent, make you feel like vomiting
Your black/white birds can give me five like Donovan
Pop the champagne for the illest hustler in the game

And I ain't even mention my deals yet
Cuz I don't wanna have you freaked out over this real shit

I got the sour so I'm Rolling Stones
I'm popping shit on my mobile phone
I never slip cause I keep the fully loaded chrome
And have my niggas even stay …
That's why we pour a liquor for the Grateful Dead, we miss you
Where I'm from, it's either guns or roses

Take it back to the Lee's and Wranglers
Take what we want, explain this
Famous for my kitchen knives, rings, and the fifths are stainless

I feel sorry for you, my boy

I've been living in this world
Not knowing where I'm going (Knowing where I'm going)
This world ain't showing
That it's gonna get better, better (Yeah, it's gonna be trouble again)

My days getting shorter, my nights getting longer
My cell getting smaller, my son getting taller
I exercise my mind, my body getting stronger
But my blood getting colder, heart getting harder
My chances for appeal, getting slimmer
My skin getting brighter, my hair getting thinner
See, when you stressed out, you could age fast in here (Have mercy)
I done seen weak niggas not last a year
So before lights out
I write my kids every night, kiss the stamp on the kite
Say a prayer, I hope it lands safe in this flights
I pray they sleep safe through the night
Try to teach my son right, give him some jewels
But it's hard to raise my boy from this visiting room
Many cells turned to prisoner's tombs
I just pray I don't die in here, and last night I almost cried a tear
(Have mercy)

To all my gun holders, stand up, get it
Cuz when the killas come around, it's on
Bullets get blown, warn 'em and they re-up fast
Say some back shit, your flagship gone
Can't play the building no more
Can't hang around by the store no more
It's really on, you a dickhead
Now you a dead man with no hand
Now you can't believe you jammed

Between my six niggas, sixty years, stay in the crispy airs
Hundreds, blunted, we up top, switching lairs
Money equal power, horror equal real when borrowed
Ratchet barrel under your ears
Mean streets in the middays, they robbers, but life's so hard
Even the cops clutter us to starve us (Have mercy)
The killers is star struck, look at the cars and trucks
Rambo guns, it's hard to get luck
Whether fail or a come up, your number is up
Period, make you bleed Caesarean
Chop through your body, leave you right in the lobby
Hear me, kid? Extra holes right in your derriere
The blitzes, the rushes'll touch something, back in the cells
Two days later, yup, back in them cuffs again
Or leaning on the customers, hustlers, my hood illustrious
Marvelous raps, screw on mufflers (Have mercy)

To all my gun holders, stand up, get it
Cuz when the killas come around, it's on
Bullets get blown, warn 'em and they re-up fast
Say some back shit, your flagship gone
Can't play the building no more
Can't hang around by the store no more
It's really on, you a dickhead
Now you a dead man with no hand
Now you can't believe you jammed

Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh, ahhh
It hurts my heart, to see what's going on

Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters

The blocks is molded, step up ya sword piece
Moving through them housing with more ki's
Rembrandts is fresh from Scotland, crisp hats, Cristal bottles
Niggas want the problems, we back
It's time to take over the game, it's nothing
I live on the line, from corner to castles with pawns and capsules
Scramble and find, my money's up, I'm praying for war
I do this all the time, all the time, all the time
Faces of Doom, sling in the lobby
Swinging cooked raw, if you played the field you was not leaving
Fast-pacin' for CREAM chasing team
Trying to come through the hood and lie, get left for dead naked in Queens
Let them other niggas wear that, we take the credit
While we was shopping for more Nikes and off-whites
Heroin stirrers, the crib, cracked mirrors
Career thugs who serve only judges and jurors
Got to make my money this year, whether it's through rhyming or criming
I'll be on the line with my iron
Promised them llamas'll fly fast, quick at pirahnas
Trying to intervene, get caught dead, no head in pajamas
You live like a slouch from vouchers
Nobody mad, you was a fake, dead, die with no trousers
Cause you crossed the line like Miller's Crossing
Off with ya dome, I walked you through the woods, we both smoked a bone

Run these mean streets from Cali to New York
Who could ya trust? Niggas they do talk
Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters

Mean streets...
Just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in
The streets stay flooded with crack rocks and Mac shots
The scenery's money, guerrillas in the back drop
The livest'll pop, the weakest get chopped where they stand
Singing the judge's name, dropped in the stand
Drug money kills, blood on my bills, mud on my Nikes
Only buying with the couple that I trust with my life
Twenty four sev' ducking the feds, infrared wtih lead
Gamble with off track betting instead
In my hood anybody can get it, and everybody want it
Cutthroat executives, the corners, the office
And the thought is to be boss of all bosses
The cost is ya life, swimming with sharks and orcas
So keep ya guards up, or get scarred up
It's a Cold World, I told you with Allah Just'
The bigger the funds, the bigger the guns that's blazing
It's sick in the slums and niggas are stunting for nathin'

Ayo, my gun been in more niggas mouths than a whore had dick
With creamy nuts on the side of her jaw
It's Rigatone, nigga, sliding through airports
Riding on niggas like MJ, same day I rocked you, comprende?
Yeah, I'm kinda off cuz my guns was dirty
That last joint that hit you, kid, you made the top thirty
Early, walk with me and strap with a vengeance
More or less Ghostface Killah'll stretch you out like mad words in a sentence
Smell the gas burning (yeah) feel the fire (word)
Real talk, it's not that bullshit from The Wire
It's them disco kids that clap iron
Champion hoods, if ya coke don't freeze, my face is not worth frying
We crack eightballs with pool sticks
Bungee jump off a mountain of bricks
Fuck you up if you slinging those nicks
Tony Stark's from the octagon, my ox is on
Snap Matt Hughes' neck with my boxers on

Run these mean streets from Cali to New York
Who could ya trust? Niggas they do talk
Running from the feds and out of state troopers
Look up ahead, you know we got sharp shooters",https://genius.com/Raekwon-mean-streets-lyrics

'Cause I know that you are far away, far, far away
Far away, far far away today
Baby won't you...

RoadsArt waddup
Let me tell y'all a story, man
Listen man, from here

I'm tired of fishscale wars stayin' in all green
New Balance sneaker, white wranglers on the scene
We was youngsters, 80's babies getting in shit
Stolen cars, fell from monkey bars, flippin' and shit
Little thieves fresh out the P's
Broke heads is sled, slidin' through, two' five in my sleeves
Eggs and cheese, young niggas, by any means
We was saved watching Malcolm and Martin
Hold them things police, freeze, niggas is jettin'
No time for off track bettin', we was wetting niggas
Take these gunshots, sippin' rum shots on the roof
Hibernating blow with ease
Better needs, the father seeds, cutting school, dippin' but truancy Ds
Influenced me with trees
Blue and cream, sat back, all I know is how to dream
Check the theme, watch the playboys run with kings

Now it's all about good livin', raising my children
I done seen the flames, escaped from the hell storms
Credentials of a high chief, blowin' on that potent broc' leaf
My old earth got a chance to see a black man run the white house
She shows her bright teeth, oh what a beautiful sight
But still some livin' strenuous through the struggles are unbearable
To ease the pain and eagerly seek the preacher for parables
To stop the rain and hoping somewhere to bring some sunshine
I'm livin' proof that it's possible, any obstacle, you face it
Can be erased son, don't let it conquer you
Throughout my journey had some snakes in my past
But I couldn't let 'em strike me and catch the Devilish germ from them
But the lesson was valuable, yeah, I learned from them
If they ain't godly, they wicked, there's no concern for them
Know in a good space, more connections with more cake
Before I let somethin' come between a nigga I burn some'

Aiyo, burn some', kid
See if a man can flip himself inside out par
He fall out and die if you see all this shit that's going on man
It's real",https://genius.com/Raekwon-cant-you-see-lyrics

The watch he had was Bulgari, golden
Spanish kid let him hold it
He said he hit him with three cartons of menthols
The kid let him roll with it
The face had snow in it
, the bass in his voice
Now, he's acting like he ain't rich and poor in it
Crock pots are steaming, Jasmine rice and Jack Mack
With cornflake batter, it's cold in here
10:45, we lock in, pull out the headphones
Jump in the bunk,

Horn the child, I'm half-sleep, yo, hearing the pots
I see the same ice grills
Bum niggas talking to me with cold in they eye
I can't finish my meal
Under the grits, two pieces of steel
Then Spoon had left; we got guns though, we trying to chill
Big Will walked in—him and Seville
With blood in they eyes, early bird, like they ready to kill

Meet you by the store for the one vision of glory

Play wealth, keep your health and your heart first
The belt that's been passed on the last car collision and cracks
We was there rolling up, holding duffle bags, that's facts
Blood on his Fila's,  Levi's
Laid there, two chains on, where's the throne
I was slick, like poets who know his shit, cold as shit
Thugs that stay loaded then blow throughout the global quick
Fast money and sneakers, cool out king silks on
Right in front of the Flash Gordon, you crabs goners
Stealin' styles so we taxed him out on Billy Childs
The bodies was ripped from water, twist the chalice
A grown folks game to the older folks
Grey haired gangsters rockin' New Balance
See the chodes, a few challenges
Money spill, heads tumble, thugs rumble, drugs crumble
But still I'm still upon in bankers trust, thankin' us
Preparing my speech, pulled up in a peach Corniche
Seats are burgundy, soccer gear and Louis cleats
Hand me my medals, Pussy he just laughin' at us
I know you wanted my bitch, but money won't attract it
They trained, pullin' pistols see the aims
It's desert shark, that blow apart flesh and bones when it starts
The originator, cuban linx chains, diamonds and Clark's
Swim on this crime wave where bags of money get washed

They say Loyalty's golden and it will make you rich
Well, I'm royal, my cloth is purple, I never switch
High chief, low eyes and hella jewels
Word from the wise, it's time to rise and show and prove

Getting money is easy, keeping it that's the hard part
Creeps and scavengers roam the land, call 'em aardvarks
Go ahead and try me now, filthy rich Africans
From the slums' glorious days, I bring the action in
Long hair Brazilians love swallowing my childrens
Self made poet, poetry constantly bringin' millions in
Scratch that small talk, meetings with the higher ups
Walls necessary, cemetery bitch and bury chumps
Spark  and sip the champagne for the pain
Let's celebrate, this duffel bag snatch your dime piece bag another coffin though
From the era where the code is 'never trust a hoe'
My advanced stride is the coldest, yo
Ritual's get the bread and stay upon your square
For the leeches and the sly foxes please be aware
'Cause they will pray upon your shortcomings
Jeopardize the family's heir
Here's the first glass, sip it to hell, I'll see you there

Skinny chain on, family, that's thirty grand
Dirty crown in position, yeah, worthy man
Bezels is like metals, nigga, hold the Phantom
Convertible roof, hard headed, angry amber

I'm on Rodeo with yae yo, fifty baby hammers

If it's priors, I do my own dirt, spray the cameras
So many soldiers, no soft niggas in the slammers
We run wild like 'lo gazelles and baby pandas
Small nigga with his gun rum, crazy gamblers
I'm uptown fronting, the fans know what gave me grammers
So when it's over I'mma fly to my lady mansion
And get riced up, some Japanese baby salmon

Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass
We disguised as, some niggas who gon' rob, blast
Paint thousands of pictures, this my drive, smash

Blowing holes in your tipi, little wise ass

I rhyme for under the stairs niggas who hate phonies
Keep it funky, I got to, it's kings only
Timberlands, hard denims, rings only
Rock a big ass gun, when you come from me
Your president of your country, yelling 'big dummy'
Chef a fly ass nigga, he cook every Sunday
He had a beef on the runway, making shit ugly
I had on alligators clarks, camouflage rugby
Bad bitch from Brazil, who fuck, never suck me
We was cooling in the Trump section, throwing bubbly
Got my niggas with the guns out, bowling lovely
When it's on, you gon' remember, ooh, you made him hungry
Top three of the east, nigga, well what, what, B

Smoking that black cabbage
Making my enemies go poof begone

If they cover their faces stocking
Run up in the spots and let the Glock kick

Shifted, my way of thinking

And could care less about the nerves on you

One day it might change your life

Better fresher in white leather
From out the hand me downs
Flashing high-priced threads
Matching the foreign cars in the driveway

Paying more, then we came with short money, pile it up
Rocking them niggas, they rocking us back
Cause every day we thrust back, felt like the work’ll reverse that
My worst cat’ll blow you in the church, black
The day that we felt got jerked we came to two guns and three bats

We’re not gonna make it

We’ll break your legs for steak and eggs, the menu is taking regs
Beef patties with cheese, a Widala state at Ted’s

Bagged him, now we strong as hell and no going backwards
Leather jackets, new Astons, Mosans, crew flashing
Jealousy around the corner, niggas got two castles

Some went and sold dope, some came back broke and asking

From living right to living and gone in a splash, kid

All we know is jewelry and I mashed that, everybody excited
To see whatever bling on, smash that
Clever, more like a fox and ox together
Two stainless Glocks, rocks and a feather
Yeah, I'm from the lead era, shoot at
Anything that move, and move out America
And all we ever want is needed, seen it
Like a young Fillipino in Kuwait getting treated
Heavy horror armor, spike a bitch like her
Half a pound of good weed, then float through Gowanus
Brilliant master, sixteenth chapel in the Apple
Flooded up, Woolrich wackos
Park Hillians getting hillions, that means millions
All on feet like Nigerian

Shallah, I got 'em
Heatseeking missile spit, don't even try to hide, nigga
Sizzle through your skin bars, call me cyanide, bitch
Try me if you want, homey, violation's a no-no
I am the health hazard, skull & bone, poisonous logo
Unleash the dragon, massacre the scene
I'm spitting, burn a hole through the speaker, and start melting the street up
Somebody please call the fire department
And I'm a strong believer, ya'll know that I ain't the one to start with
Cuz once the fuse is lit and we strike a match and the spark smell
My face bleed and we nam them up like ox tail
Ya'll see what's happening, ya'll know what the truth is
Somebody please ask Shallah Rae why he making me do this
Cuz once I finish dudes, it's unfortunate for them yappers
Throw them in the trash, they ain't no recyling bin for rappers
I microphone control, it's the current dominant factor
The records been bodied, I personally request the pastor, gone",https://genius.com/Raekwon-crane-style-lyrics

Switch to Merlot, I know them niggas is bird, they swerve dope
Nobody gettin' it, whores is wicked with it
Little kids growin' up fast, teens is wickeded
No jobs, no checks, it's like rockin' an Olex
Rolex, her father is Cotex
Mother is so vexed, brothers is on X
Niggas is slummin' it, I'd rather see no necks
Dumb niggas, this the decade of bum niggas
It won't work, no matter how much bread you jerk

Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it
Roll up the strong, inhale it (x3)
Weed so loud, all my neighbors say they hear it

I'm usually in the lawsuits frontin'
Comin' out Bank of America, big knot on me, I'm comfy
Roll the joints, jumpin' in joints, niggas with coins beat the point
And we want appointments, yo nigga, get some ointment
Stop playin', start prayin', I just might start sprayin'
Niggas is ass and all day with it
No style with no pals, niggas is so foul
It shows how I only fuck with real, them niggas know now
I slow down, don't wanna catch a charge and go down
I'm too large, drop a bag, use a marksman
Pause, said, ""You don't want no parts of me, kid""
I'm just shootin' you real rap, so go wash with it
A legend with his hands up, suits is glammed up
I'm just bowlin' for millions out in Japan, what
Plannin' somethin', niggas ride around wearin' somethin'
Other than that or rap, I'd rather fade black


These niggas is dead already, I use machetes to eat spaghetti
They really couldn't ride a mile on my Pirellis
Bags so heavy the damns collapsed
Conversate about me, that's a chain reaction
Pressure to press in past aggression
Hope your body guard got pain protection
One in the chamber, middle finger, no fornicate
So many bullets in the clip, it's 'bout to sufficate
My uncle was late, my aunt ain't show up
How you gon' tell an old man to grow up
It's like comparin' Earl to throw up
Same frame of mind but a different poster
I'm 'posed to be what I wanna be
Dream so big for the world to see

And usually the only black man is me",https://genius.com/Raekwon-fila-world-lyrics

They pistol-whipped him, shot him with his Dutch
He lost all his trust
Smoking Dutch, choking in his lust
Living out his lies, so one day he stole a pair of nuts
Tried to go hard, that’s the wrong song
He should’ve just jetted, Moet in his mind up was wrong
He could’ve made it but he waited, hesitated
Laying on a bitch, they caught him right in front of his Moms
They did him extra dirty, stripped him, tied his hands to his Vans
Them old school niggas left a victim
His blooded waist, broken arm, cut him in his face
I heard the chants, he don’t deserve life, let him lamp
Choking him, poking him, hitting him with all kinds of knobs
Left him soaking, ?? all in his mouth
He was out, they broke him up, knocked him out
Three times then threw him in a slouch
They took his sneakers and his beeper
Where’s Theresa? Snatched the reefer
That bitch is next, catch you on the sequel
Swollen eyes, his face was pulverized
Trying to be a hustler, two ounces he want to mobilize
Dumb dummy, no team, he barely had money

Still Struggling,UnKnown,UnKnown,"I know how it feels to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you're the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish s-shit
I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew
Flippin' over 62s
Cause G-E-D was it B-I-G, I got P-A-I-D
That's why my mom hates me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out Nick's went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
Four drunks trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm doing court for an assault
That I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the ginger bread man
You better have your gat in hand cause man

A man with a dream with plans to make C.R.E.A.M
Still struggling, Survival got me buggin' (ghetto misery)

Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough

May help you maintain

I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no job
Had secondhands, moms bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one
And that one, pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen, who was a fiend
Started smoking wools at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed, for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off, and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick tight clique and went all out
Catchin' keys from across seas
Rollin' in MPV's, every week we made forty G

Out in Grenada, chilling snow pebbles on prosperous
Hugh Heff's who fucking his steps
Favorite color purple, we would circle the jets
He talk base, in a I-8 racing clear doors we face
In life, in trying to get away from these whores
Or rolling uptown in gambling stores
Stealing clothes in Macy’s, running out with like five, six Velours
Thug couple Rugby boys who get fly and break jaws

It's back to the real shit, that wave up, phase up
If he owe me dough, I hope that he pay up
Hand on that trigger when that finger roll, he'll lay up, ha
Wait up, just homicide humor
I could've bodied you sooner, I just provided the rumor
Whatever he rhyming on, I'll bring it to you
I'm a phenomenon, Travolta with the tumor, Fred

Blowing exotic kush, watermelon flavor, no seeds
Burn it by the O-Z, imported from O-T
Export it from T-O, salute to the OG
Flips is high risk, but the moves is low key
Young hustlers, dreaming about awards and tours
The world is ours, and any store accepting the credit card
Bought her: fly boosters, designer shades, and all that
Hit it in the back, then fell back in the callback
I’m busy chasing paper on the cash rule major
All we do is see numbers like an old school pager
Double your wager, we busy clocking like Flavor
Time waits for no man, man don’t be a hater

Champagne slackin', traffickin' while they travel
Word got back the old time friends and snakes rattled
Two different 'burbans, but the one that dropped the birds got tailed.. Information for the ones that like to steal, got mailed
Pussy power made the plans sour
Apartment full of party powder, outside a stakeout for hours
Click clacks from big gats and rags
Soon as the door squeaks they runnin' up on the grass
Bang, flash! Shots ride on path of broken glass

Be carful, sleep with the po-po's yo
It's like it's just Easter
If you was deceased just cleat ya
You might get slapped with the meat cleaver
Don't run the streets neither
You can't shop with your bitch either
No dirty franks, no bras, not even cheeba
Go ahead get movie caught up, please son
They might find you in the ?
A dick in your mouth, two franks stiff in the freezer
You never had respect, you had Visa's
You come through the hood, Jesus
There go this nigga with pieces
I should've just shot you for cheese sticks
Eat a dick you bitch, nigga reach
I got you just breathe bitch
You won't get the front on Rich, I got cheese bitch

Word up, cause we coming to get you nigga
Believe me, you won't be able to take a cab nowhere nigga
For real, cause we gone be on you nigga, Ha haa
Word up, word up, honey mustard ass nigga

With big hammers and big money man, word up
So, jus-jus-just move away from here man, y'knahmean
We don't wanna have to come and get you and make you leave man

Zonder mij,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Soms ga ik terug in mijn gedachtes. Om herinneringen op te halen. Je liet me los die gedachte kan ik niet loslaten. Ik mis je steeds vaker weet niet of dat ooit wel stopt. Denken aan jou maakt me blij maar tegelijk ook kapot. Ik heb nooit gezocht naar liefde maar jij bracht dat met je mee zou er altijd voor me zijn. Waarom liet je me alleen? Ik denk niet dat je weet wat je doet met mij! De liefde lijkt zover van de pijn. Maar het is toch hier me hart klopt voor jou maar het klopt niet. Soms wil ik jou vergeten maar mijn gedachte voor jou die stopt niet. Waarom ben je niet hier bij mij? Ik zweer d'r gaat geen dag voorbij dat ik niet aan je denk. Het doet me pijn om te weten dat je in mn hart maar niet in mn armen bent. Ik kan niet denken aan de toekomst als ik in het verleden blijf. Maar ik blijf liever kijken naar ons dan niet met je zijn. Ik zweer die gedachte die doet me pijn. Geen jij bij mij maar toch is het wij. Want ik zie mezelf niet zonder jou alsof ik op mezelf niet mezelf kan zijn. Ik snap niet waarom ik nog steeds wacht ik snap niet wat jij in die tijd dacht. Ik snap niet dat ik zoveel moeite in jou stak en dat al die moeite voor niks was. Gebroken ik voel niks meer. Zo gebroken, nee ik voel niks meer. Denken aan jou doet me pijn maar Ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. En ik hoop dat jij alles hebt wat je nodig hebt zonder mij. Ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik je mis en dat ik met zoveel vragen zit. Maar ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. Kijk ik snap niet veel van liefde maar weet dat ik dat had met jou dus als ik weet wat liefde is dan weet ik dat dat komt door jou. Zoveel geleerd van jou alles was gemeend met jou. Alles voelt zo leeg rond mij mis die late night dates met jou. Ik mis jou hand in mijn hand. Ik mis jou lip op mijn lip. Ik mis het om jou steeds te zeggen waarom ik jou leuk vind baby. Ik zie in je ogen dat die keuze niet jouw keus is. (Ik zie in je ogen dat die keuze niet jouw keus is). Ik liep en loop voor je. Ik word blij en word boos voor je liefde is iets speciaals. Dit gaat door je maag maar je weet dat ik kan koken voor je. Als geluk in de winkel lag zou ik het kopen voor jou. Je bent mijn queen maar wilt die kroon niet. Toen samen maar nu lonely. De liefde waait langzaam weg schatje maar mijn hoop niet. Je was mijn up up up toen ik down was. Ik had maar 1 wens en dat is dat je mijn vrouw was
Ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. En ik hoop dat jij alles hebt wat je nodig hebt zonder mij. Ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik je mis en dat ik met zoveel vragen zit. Maar ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij
Ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij. En ik hoop dat jij alles hebt wat je nodig hebt zonder mij. Ik kan niet ontkennen dat ik je mis en dat ik met zoveel vragen zit. Maar ik hoop dat jij gelukkig bent waar je nu ook bent zonder mij",https://genius.com/Raekwon-zonder-mij-lyrics

Yo, Straight up y'all
Yo Ghost I love you man
You know how we do this right here
We do this for our family
See you soon kid

The greatest thing a kid could have
To chill with his family, sit back laying on his Dad
Props go out, next thing you know Pops roll out
Moms cussed him out, ""get the fuck out""
Couldn't understand it, feelings turning to hard granite
Now she a one single parent
Growing up on welfare, she might need healthcare
That made me feel no one else cares
Moms is a part of my life forever
Getting drunk that's her business guess that's stormy weather
Fish and grits, twelve o' clock midnight pissed
Stop crying Ma take a kiss
Take care of ya brother and sis
Something happen to me I miss ya better be offic
She meant that shit, every mouthful accurate
Took me to school be immaculate
Taught by the best, remember stress
A ghetto agenda that's how we rest
Don't let 'em play with your emotions
Lotioning me, little money in my vest
Damn, Mom going through it, still holding me through it
Sneaker money fucked up, yo
Yeah when Granddaddy died, I know you didn't see me cry
Held it in, it hurted Ma a lot
Remember, Bucs had me in a tux
Went to beef stake Charlie's had my first pay cut
Yeah, loving you always
Screaming on janitors in hallways ""It's my son"" always
Caught me in the crib yo, smoking
Sat me down heart broken
Hoping the phase had me open yo
You like, hey yo, for real
You like loving you for life it's only right
Strong yourself we make it
Weak minded you naked
The pain and hurt I can't take it
Plus my Uncle in jail, that's your brother go see him
He look forward to it like mail
You my ace, you the lady in the place
You ain't a waste, we just trapped inside a low-life place
Trust me I'm gonna work hard
Tattoo my body, throw it on top where I got scars

See it son, start crying

What the fuck is that? Chill chill what up?
Stop playing, man, man, you know what it is, man
Fuck that, you know what it is, yo, nigga what up?
Where that money? Man, yo, yo, yo, come here!
Stop acting like you don't know, you already know

Indian head, jewelry
Out in Egypt with the wrists of fury
Spanking bracelet, rocking Asics
Trick bandit, Ghost is brick granite
At the U.S. Open with my whole len, slapping up fifty scramblers
Niggas said the II was classic, a lot of crack is in the game, yo
But your shit is the only 'lastic
C.R.E.A.M. rap, militant flow, combination with Swahilian dough
Guaranteed we dose that, in the beast like pizzas
All I know is reefer and street stuff
Stay fly, moving in fleece, what?
Traveling the continents with confidence
Cuban Linx III coming, don't know when, but the time is running

By any means on, Ron O'Neal lean on
Freestyle, you want it from Ghost? Then throw C.R.E.A.M. on
Suited up, smelling like Fahrenheit with jeans on
Knock the rice out a wedding, come and get your bling on
Next winter we in log cabins, more baggage, more savage
Central Park killas, that equals more stabbings
You read the papers, more horrors like Amityville
Profanity kills, you like lint on a raggety silk
We rock bulls, rock jewels, you heard the interludes
Blow up beds in a fifty yard swimming pool
Jumping out of planes for dough, Gucci parachutes
Abdul Raheem written across is the Ashtabu'
Suede loafers, 'Lo scarves, my little grandson want
The 20-10 Mercedes-Benz go kart
So he can pull out the lollipop keys on 'em
His pops'll push the Bugatti drop V on 'em
Stampede on 'em, Rap Playoffs got a three-nothing lead on 'em
Sparking MC's like we quoting our degrees on 'em",https://genius.com/Raekwon-silver-rings-lyrics

Jumping in front of cars, 
lending niggas four pounds
Walk, keep it moving, yo, 
hop in the range
I know you real, cuz I raised you, not gon' front on your aim
We spit together, rocking wrist lights, stunting, right in front of
The parking lot
I'm like that shark wearing, lighting, been Niking
One bling, two bling no, only Boeings
And trips to Australia, yo, my niggas is smoke fiends
Fuck in every part of the planet, slam a forty with a salmon
Hit your ho on target, we family
These are big niggas, grown men, who travel the world
Calling global drug dealing niggas, moguls
Never locals, only courts I now is sober
And this is real nigga food, Chef giving out his soul food

Get a plate, man, for real, man
Come eat, man

Bulldogs they calling, 
phantom doors lift up
, crawling
Kiss Shallah hand in the Holland
Larry and his guns is weird, six hundred onions a year
No more running, see the morgue, shorty
Wild nights, crew gunning cats, animal jackets and axes
Bulletproof buses, forty backs
Niggas is Romans, then turn around and they gon', then
Hoods is paro', niggas is logged in
Channel to channel, hammer to hammer
Rock a bandana knife like Rambo
 on the scrambler
Get high, trust your trigger man, logic is the bigger man
Get shit done, hit Orlando
New improved killas is beemer, plasma walls with the ninas
Stick your arm in the back, you jink
Thirty seven, three one five, eleven oh nine
With two T's, it's like rolling up new trees

Cloth the certain way, notice
My style's new now, with generals luau, drugs, guns
Chilling on the cool out, don't make me pop you, this is not cool
Guaranteed to give you something that works, you're dumped in the dirt
Shitting up blood, fingers is burnt
Many cycles when you fight in my walls, it's like Michael and the Bulls
See a flying piece of iron, no lying
No fib and no bullshitting, the shines is forbidden
We like Crouching Tiger, you just a fucking kitten
Bout to get that wig re-open and then smoked in
Bitches is watching, snatch you in the open, yo
Twenty-four, seven, we legends, the myth, the riff the gift
Shaolin bounded with more whiff
Clap 'em with them get down boys, we call them the niggas
Who want it with us, we the belt holders in the business


Yo, ay, the streets be calling and shit
A lot of veterans be calling it quits
They be calling my flow ill, but still I'm never calling in sick
This is Meth Man, New York niggas calling me piff
Fuck the cops that be calling me Cliff, flag me down on the Concord
Police dogs all up in my whip
I get cake, women all in mix, they wanna jump in the six
And groupie niggas wanna jump in your flicks
We live the life, Scarfaces and guns, I used to fight for crumbs
Throw an ace, kick the dice and run
Plead your case, you ain't nice as son, I got the drive to win
So where you niggas get your license from?
Bite an ear, Mike Tyson, uh, that means dough and my nose itch
And coke fiends is blowing they noses

(Yo, oh, who the fuck is this?)
(Yo, walk this bitch outta here, man)
(Her hands is all white and shit, looking all crazy)
Fingerprints all over the refrigerator
You fake ass Gucci wearing nigga!
Yo, girl, chill chill, come on, man
Just give me papi number, man, for real, man, you playing

I'm on the crisp blue yacht, with my hand on the twat
With a Commodore CD, a bottle of stock
On a green rug, GG's on it, a mean snub
Bad little Asian, named Asia, my love
Had connects, plus fame favorite flick, Black Rain
Pinky finger rocked up, giving me brain
Like Griselda's little flame, ran with her for forty months
Came home, her estate was insane
Vuitton toilet paper, Polo walls, Jimmy Choo
Pots and pans, this broad had a horse
Cash it in, yo, Masta, live with me, take it all
You can have whatever, five hundred leathers
Bruno Mag' sweaters, Gucci rain boots
Brook Brothers, New Eras, jew killers
New line sponsored by fellas, catch 'em in the hall balling
I thought about it, whatever

CNN watching, ESPN friend
Coat shopping, lochness, smothered up, god damn
Boo living it good, Aspen, the color of wood
On the outside, vibe is good
Knowing I'm hood, I should, escape project life
Run with my rifle, live in the woods
Grow a rugged beard, and chill, poppa real
Poppa eat, poppa a rolling stone, for real
This the deal, chill, this how we live in the Hill
Kill a nigga for me, kill or be killed
Share that money and still, when it's time to reveal
You never met me, but respect me, you will
Dinosaur wheels we peel, skated with the fly seals
She broke out, died in Brazil
Met her younger cousin Nil', you looking for birds, right?
Yeah, my cousin said you real, you gotta

Oh shit, Goldschläger in the gold dagger in a gold Acura
A gold Phantom pulled up, yo, go backwards
They had a package on 'em, hold half a bit, it's half rough
But still, I got me forty traffickers
Riding through Manhattan tough, got my mavericks up
We on, rolling thirty deep in the gadget trucks
Spending magic bucks, fuck around, get an Aston truck
Fly around, fucking actress sluts
We been clashing with the masses, what
Put the gasses up, flame 'em out his lab, splash him up
That's how we get it on, that's what's up
Don't ever wrassle us, you might get shackled in your castle, what

Put this bag out, and after that, take it to heed
Man, I see you in a minute, chill
You got to lay on the other side of the fucking wall for you

Straight up, last thing I heard, the nigga grandmother was in Argentina
I want her too, for real, for real, we ain't playing no games, man
The nigga like to shop and floor shine
He stay on 44th, catch the nigga by Delancey, too
For real, I got his baby pictures and everything

Probably cried, chinky eyes, heading straight for the dirt
That's how it is in my hood, Compton, niggas put you under the Earth
Four-five bulging out that white T-shirt like a hard on
This block shit is ill, like the nigga that put Raekwon the God, on
I can drink to that, but all the Patron probably gone

Ashy knuckles, taped up veggies in a duffle
Back to back Beemers, Moss'll play me in a huddle, yeah

Hard tops,

Swinging through hoods, ratchets and a couple Gillette's
Peoples is straight, can't tell me nothing, we cake
Rolling lovely, bricks and white shit up in Mercedes

When it's time to ride, I be in the front with the ace
Lighting blunts, Marvin Gaye shit, bumping them great
Glass of Cru', get a writing hand, wiping the paint
Candy apple shine, all my niggas in the line, pollying

Knowhatimsaying, you know the type of person you is

Being a street narrator (aiyo, what up, famo?)

Reefer lit, love hip hop, the gangstas got me like the broccoli
Brooklyn baby cooling at a swat meet
Real niggas wanna meet me, ladies wanna eat me
Money clean Mercedes claim, baby, beat me
Love getting dressed up, sweats and techs
Ride around the hood, good, getting Gotti respect
Hand is golden, an OG rolling and holding, yo
Fresh kicks, soft leather, pockets is swollen
Let my jam hit your tape deck, it's straight up, and made up
For every real nigga with his gun on him, hate up
Flying through the city nights, new flights

Drug shop, I'm sorry, Atari in the Ferrari

Them young boys'll run up on you, shoot your whip up

Pack it up, wanna rap, wanna rock, what up?
Wanna pop, get up, fuck around and get your block hit up
Bring your team and we'll box 'em up
Think M.O.P. is not what up

It seems I'm a bit late here
Don't worry, these men are all gonna die

See from the side where it slum at, dum at, rum at
Cognac, combat, contact, contrast
Crom's packing out like Beyonce back
She bang out a song like the Fonz back
Bigger things, bring the slangs, slicker than the sharpest pen
Nigga here, combat, sweet dick Willie T, Rudy Ray Moore game
Woodgrain all in the board reigns, before rain flooded
Like storm drains, boss man, bundling raw 'caine
Fours bang, neighborhood war games
Get your weight up, you looking anarexic
Posted on the block proper with the hammer vested
Bitch came with empty hands, that's the hand she left with
Thirsty ass with the water and it sounded desperate
Break a white an hour, based it forty grand invested

Throw em a jewel with meat on it, now did you
Analyze it like a 27 inch, give me the wrench
So we can throw a niggas some heroin and Jane and Finch

Bitch I'm from the ski mask school house
Where life stay complicated, intoxicated and gooned out
And niggas ain't graduated but they can relate with they tool belt
That 2 for 10 crack stems, needles and spoons out
Ooh I need some paper, ooh my fingers itching
I wish that Santa Claus would put a brick under my tree for Christmas
A new wig for my bitch and two choppers off in my stocking
Baking soda yola'n locking, you cop then drop the deposit
Signed my life right on the dotted line, wrote it in blood
Got my uncle wiping down my tires, sold em a dub
Niggas know I rap for most of my days, I rap with my plug
Before I see my platinum album, I see my day with the judge, fuck it

Everybody strivin' to feast, we in the belly of the beast
Leech us, starve us, niggas wanna piece

Punch broke the Dred's jaw, pulled the four out
And went off, told him that he can't sling his raw
When he fell, yo, he broke his wrist, his bangles flew off
His Balley's was scuffed, then he blew a kiss
Bleeding out the side of his ear, niggas was staring
And the silk shirt was ripped off, Punch cut his hair
Razors was bloody, he kept hitting, Dred grabbed his shirt
Showing his stomach, the kid had zippers on him
Bitches was flipping, they grabbed Tasha, caught her for a Louis
Snatched her titties right up out the bitch bra
No selling over here, Jack, heard the Dred mumble
'You be dead in a week' then he stumbled back
Little young Keyon rushed him, yeah, shorty was a vet
Gillette soldiers, shorty hit the neck
Blood squirted, look like laundry detergent, the Dred fell out
Right from there, he gon' need a surgeon
You ain't dead yet?

Gangsters, buffalos, flexing in bear hats
We call 'em Russians, New Yorkers'll wear that
Gambling outside Macy's, me and all these career rats
Don't know 'em but I'm about to break 'em
Ice roller bound, rolling in cracks
Yanks said stack it, this ain't how I get down
The crowd got silent, heavy face slap
He slapped his Wis in the face for looking down
Caesar with the half-moon, large gash wound on his face
Pretty boy, yo scarred for life
He ain't a sucker though, this nigga a killer
Caught his enemies up in the box, ill y'all, did 'em right
Now he rich, his partner's the real here
Curly haired Indian who sat in a wheelchair just scheming
Yeah Don, hop in the BM, come see me
Before you know it machine guns I'm seeing


Rolling yard weed out the jars
All I see is bag beaches, king, black sand, Wallabee Clarks
We in intense mad colorful pictures, everybody get nice
Gift bags for the bitches that's ice
A-yo the shotty in Alex hand, chill in the foyer
Give your lawyer this bread and be cool, just stay a warrior
The East is in the building, bottles with sparkles on 'em
Yo Rae, I fuck with your waves with the goggles killing
That's what it is, Manhattan all the way to the Grand Rapids
We stay stunting with the clappers
Fishscale parties, commercial niggas bother me
We just as hard as they come, that's my discography

Getting it hold the town niggas got a rainbow
Everyday motto, seek for pay day
All in the lotto, Sheep's could sued grey
Out in the Cabos eating steak plates

Moneybags stacked in duvet sheets
Few strange freaks follow the Wraiths
Walk through the gates, nigga
Pyrex Cubano connection
New York Mexicans, they call us the team for smugglin' wet shit
The Al Pacinos of rap, yep, they planned it with me
Pass the baguette, gold Louis phone, hand it to me
Raised a million champs, this is our civilian's lamp
Furless sweats, stay in jets, kill a billion camps
Pussy niggas get strangled fast
Still I'm cool on the fast, rockin' the grill of glass
Desert boot on, countin' a million cash
This is all I ask for, love is fair war, let's build the masses
Sittin', boat sailin', scenic routes, catch the quotes
Young, armed and dangerous  couple posters
I'm like known in a couple coasts

Contract killers so we rarely talk a lot
Guiseppes and my weapon when you see me steppin'
10th grade education with a MAC-11
The definition of a renaissance
Twice a day I change watches, chains and the charms
Tatted on my back, chest and my palms
Then it's me and Diddy, dice games at the Palms
Blew a mil' in cash just to let the bitches watch
Take her down to the lobby, get the bitch a watch
Tinted windows, smokin' with a screw face
Black hoodies on, bullies think it's Wu-Tang
Barry White blarin' in the white Benz
Runnin' like I had a curly perm back then
It's Rozay and I'm 40 up
Pink Belaire in a nigga's cup

Ayo jumpin' out the shower, jewels on, heated up
Fluffy Polo towels in Melbourne, gettin' it
Hands is ashy, cash keep comin', dice hand like Lil Poo
Young god bowlin' with thunder
Bettin' bricks out at the Knicks came with Cubans from Biscayne
Burnin' the Castro cigars with a big flame
Godfather coats and hard bottoms
Everything down to cribs, hoes and gear, we got 'em

Eventually, bust a rap gun mentally
Been doin' this century kid, just meant to be
Get on your knees and bless me with a gem in the Caribbean
Skiin' off by P.M
Snatch Canadian cream with Scandinavians
Fellatium style, play it like thirty-two Arabians
The greatest lesson is don't owe, you might get stole on

Acapella or deep dirty instrumental
I could blow the sky like the stormy wind blew
One gallon of whylin', Park Hill profilin'
I cut your face up rough fifty sure while you're smilin'

Every evenin', I have a by myself meetin'
Thinkin' who's gonna be the next to catch a beatin'

Tricknology is in one hand

The present's how will it be
The past don't even ask just believe
Looking in the dictionary
Trying to spell out hard words
Define 'em and design 'em
I shine and curve
Take this jewel in and conquer me
I blend it in wit ganja
Not for the babies it's a mind sponsor
From the 17 million God raised
2 million lost slaved
19 million may we all praise

For real and keep all getting paper

I shine in many parts, darts is suede
It's like smooth lemonade
With a tap of ginger, yes, I'm a ninja
Regardless of my info, it's meant for
The solids and the kinfolk
Sit down, check what your kin wrote, bro
Knowledge is college, blessings is lessons
Don't be no dumb-dumb-dummy 'cause that don't...

That don't make you solid (Ah, yeah)
Solid like gold (Solid like gold)
You need to let go (Woah)
Might bust your gun but that don't make you solid
Solid (Solid like gold, yeah)
You're hollow inside and I know (Woah, woah)
It ain't in your design, yeah
Make you solid

From blazin' half-moon Caesars in the west with some ends
They know Shallah, his glow is like fly, fly Benzes
In the midst with hustler style
Every corner is trial, stand for somethin' or get caught in the wild
I used to love gettin' down with the foul
Pullin' hammers in crowds
The shit from yesterday I wish I knew now
It's all bugged out, thugged out
Some in the mountains and some are slugged out
Hit with twenty-five, that ain't live
But still I bow
Praises due, don't fuck with the haters, dude
Add on and drop a few major jewels to save a few
Whether bein' tough and that's how you roll
Just listen to your brother with the scroll
Take these blessings and go, bro (What?)

That don't make you solid (Ah, yeah)
Solid like gold (Solid like gold)
You need to let go (Woah, woah)
Might bust your gun but that don't make you solid (Don't make you solid)
Solid (Solid like gold, solid)
You're hollow inside and I know (Woah, woah)
It ain't in your design, yeah (Woah)
Solid (Ah, yeah)
Solid like gold (Solid like gold)
You need to let go (Woah, woah)
Might bust your gun but that don't make you solid

It ain't in your design, yeah (Woah)

Nah man, Nah
Nah this what I'ma do
I'ma get on the phone one time
Stupid, yo, eh-yo, eh-yo

Why this shit ain't cooking up right
Papi told me this is solid white
Fuck it wrap it up take it back up
Still in all it's a play out
Tired of spending money might get them niggas laid out
Yo, yo Fernando sent me yo
Stop acting hostile yo
And yo don't point that shit at me
Bad enough I gotta come in the crib
With spanish niggas using languages and shit
I'm feeling like a dick
Left the crib with my hand brolic
This is some bullshit
Might get knocked take the wrist coward
Yo Fernando what happened?
Shit cooking up backwards light up a Backwood
Don't make me backtrack
Blew it dime it the llelo lay low
Saying in my mind, fuck that papi gotta pay off
Cash rules the Power-Wu chant it
Yo Louis this ain't our product, this is Carlos family
Oh y'all wanna play me like a smoker
Coming out my ice choker
My man in the back, looking colder
Papi yo why y'all wanna jucks me
Yo listen B we got the best clientele since '83
Fuck it, pull out the pot let's cook it
Light the stove up
Julie go to the store get some flour
Sat back burning a big dutch
With the crisp 18 shot Glock, stashed in my nuts
Poured it in the Pyrex sizzling
Now it start drizzling
Rainy day murder black won't miss him
Still I'm yelling this shit is business
But they still ain't gon' violate
What I stand for with these drizzers
He took it off the stove run the water
Trying to work me yo
Knew I shouldn't've hit the nigga's daughter
He mighta showed more love
Than went in the freezer
Broke the ice down, pour it in
We both looking at it on the twirl around particles grew
Fly Kahlúas is mad sliding Coronas through
Feeling like Castro's cousin
Gave them niggas all of my life
All of my paper all my judgement
It droppa only like an ounce worth
Should I just come out my shirt
Go berserk and let the Macks burst
Skate off body in the Bronx
Same shit Gotti was on
Shallah they gonna get your's play it calm

Ain't nothing my nigga, tryna get paid in full man

So you reppin' Black Wall Street right
(Black Wall Street general, five star soldier and all that)
No question I'm reppin' Vatican, we gone do this big nigga style
Let's take em there for real, let's go

Before flusty days livin' in Killa Hills
I was young'd out with rusty waves
Cuttin' hair, chillin', going down town blazin'
Layin' up in Albee Square, when I bought my first fronts there
Everybody young as fuck, in the pizza shop, what up?
Brooklyn niggas rap with a cuffle
Call the highlights the gangsta dialect
Before I let any nigga take mine I'm dyin', Moet
What's the jump off, the new shit
Demi sec, hold up a sec
Get this crack money, niggas except
Wick checks, food stamps and amps
Blue Wallabees, Aviaries' on in the back on the ramp
You know we pop off for hours, cowards beware
Word to Mother, you gon' respect my power
Respect the dollar, no quizzy, get busy
It was like adolescents at war, we clapped them thizzies
On the duece suited Voltron, the ratchet heavy
In the crib coolin' blunted, watchin' Tom & Jerry
Bagin' up, laughin', blingin', rhymin' and singin'
When it come to getting currency, call me a swinger
We rock Maybachs, Benzes is little
Icicles on, cover the ground with a massive dribble
Call us ballers, brawlers, them whores want all us
Suede down, coolin', playin' spades with quarters
And then left it for the rap game
All my niggas grab 'pagne
Bust of them seals it's mad flames, y'all lames
Stay in your lane, we movin' like big money
Bet a nigga die for them chains
You know the slang baby, watch me lay her
Half goon, half mayor, the other half call me a hater
But later, I'ma polly for Rae-ah, and a hundred wolves
Pull next time, respect the playa, what

I'm sick and that drop Aston is the medicine
Ridin' with the moon in the rear view, it's only evident
I'm fly as the wings on a seven forty-seven jet
Game code his rhymes, ain't even been recorded yet
On the fence where my Father used to sport a Vet
And my Uncle Red ran the rock like door set
Rewind time ten years before I had the Lex
Mail man scared to drop the bills on my door step
Little nigga street dreamin' 'bout a fast car
My father had dope tracks like his arm was Nascar
In eighty-seven, shit I was maybe seven
Watchin' my big brother throwin' ten, come back with eleven
Only knew what it was cause I overheard
My Pops on the phone talkin' 'bout selling all my birds
I cried over the next eight years over them pigeons
To only find out not one was missing, word

And read the DuPont all day nigga
And get the stove clean you heard

Our jewelry is different from all these
Phony ass, carrot cake ass niggas
Fake ice philanthropist, you know what the fuck I mean nigga
Ha ha, it's real niggas right here boy

Me and my homey, we bought like forty things up
Long as you owe me, you won't get a damn thing, son
Shoot off your kangol, while you in the plane, fronting
Stop, admire me, ya'll should of fired me
Cause when I come back, it's me and my diary
None of that bullshit, few men got tired of me
My niggas is wrong, they hated, and they lied to me
Explain the saga, fuck yo, your chain liver
Fuck the blinging, have my money by five, to me
Ya'll 'pose to bring it, fuck you and your whole variety
I'm bringing my hammers, I beat it like, five to three

Don't disrespect me, son, you will get popped up
My resume's off the hook, now, check mi casa

Thought you was loyal, now a nigga can't support you
Blastin' you up, and off me, now you look rewarded

Bitch don't yell, I'm not impressed, don't push me
I'm back with some haters, they wipe shit and blast pussies up
Bloody ya blazer, take all your man cush weed
Yeah, I'm coming just to claim a title
Rap is boring, niggas need another idol
When I'm gone, just let off like forty rifles
Aiming at rappers, biting off the God's bible
I destroy you, lyrically, I spit oil
This is war, you can never escape, conio
Ya'll some lamesters, never seen a yard soiled
When it's on, now we gon' see who's loyal

Grab a Phil, wipe the ashes off my leather pants, the vest is just lambskin
I'm the real Muhammad Ali style in the Phil
You know it, (?)'s my clique, Italianos
Walk through the door few deep, roll a leaf
Whoever want it, just sign up, I won't even beef
Ninjaz with heart, the payouts, the city is chaos

Searching for the big rainbow wearing a Kangol and a raincoat
Jump with the .45, it's Django
Flying in a new (?),, missing my man
You got a Christy in the can where you destined
They see the young cub come up, drop a bracelet through your burpees
Stay under the radars, no attorneys
Yeah gangster, stay gangster, made from Kingston
I wish real niggas would say something
Glorified getting it, guns on us, tons of trust
Few niggas in the slums is us, but hate being here
Just meeting here, thinking it's sweet in here
'Til niggas take your head off for creeping here
Far from the curb to the jails
I write poems to flip tails, and letters to judges to get deals
I miss the good days, you know, the hood days
Now we sit in mansions on good grades
The moments is raw, baller's is poor
Run with your boy, light and blow a blunt if you're bored
Take a flash when the (?), them niggas was ashy
Dreaming on the benches, don't bash me
Crying, letting the tears dry, no one I'm trying
Society rubbing me when I'm eying,

With war fears, hit the beers, just wait
Come up with a plan to hit a bank, what

I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together

Word up, yeah, yeah, yeah
Word up, blip blip blap blap blap
What up?

Who don't know? They don't know, betta let 'em know
There they go, here we go

Aiyo Clientele Kidd
Layin in the crib gettin' ill money, those who hate ours get hit
Got rugby's on and 4/5ths
Attractin' them niggas I go against, the money was his
One nasty unit of murderers, all type of Goons'll watch
Then four minutes later they burglars
I heard from the grapevine mine made it
Elevate the name up, this gift gotta reign and his game went up
And now he's stronger than ever, Nike jackets and Classics
Go against it and it's instant vendettas
He run things, gun down Kings, check the joint the kid flyin' in
Crib in Africa with two lions
Somethin' like the Prince of a jewel thief, so smack the millions
Came back wrapped it up, too sweet
The game is missin' somethin' unique
I put too much to fall back on, I rather just sleep

CHEF! We designin', rhymin' with Diamonds
CHEF! Ice Water, it was all in the timin'
CHEF! He gave y'all niggas bricks on consignment
CHEF! To the death and he Billboard climbin'

Yeah uh
Yo Don Carta' bomb harder over nearly everybody
Very rarely you find me without the mini-shotti
Just waitin' for Rae to give me the cue and
You see about 100 Puerto Rican niggas shootin'
Get down, lay down, we don't play around
I don't know what you heard but, we don't play around
It's cooked coke, but look, but what the fuck happened?
How you leave the dope game to pursue rappin'?
Already knowin' that ya shit was trash
Breathin' hard on the mic when yo' click is ass
All we tryin' to do is bring dignity to rap
And you kiddin' me? I'm literally the epitome of that
Uh, we much better than y'all, Terre-error the Squad
My niggas set it when we get in the yard
Whether Marcy or Comstock, triggers 'pon cock
Straight punch in ya lung and you niggas gon' drop
What?


Yo yo yo shoot him in his mouth.. (nah)
Fuck him, get the gasoline tell Terry to pull the Ac' up
Bring him to Rae warehouse, hang him from hooks then skin his ass
As lame as he look he ready to cook (yeah)
And he pleadin' for mercy, bleedin' from his dome and he thirsty
The first week we made him eat shit!
Videotaped his wiz and I fucked his bitch
Made him watch me on the couch havin' fun with his kids
So what hurts more: is it me showin' love to ya fam?
Or you in the box laid under the floor?
Or keep you alive blow torchin' ya balls?
My murder chainsaw, ya bloods on my Scarface walls
Not even Ajax can clean that, Jack
We need that maintenance man shit that kill that greasy blood on contact
Finish you off cuz I'm pressed for time
Your man and 'em will be next to die

Rockstars,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II,2009,"Aiyo, Rockstars, bases and capers flying through cases
With placed bread, lead blowing through domes, scalped faces
Moving through towns, skama lit, nations bend stations
Dope fiend Asians, smoke cream vanquishes
The town is thirsty for work, blood hurting
Flash the curtain, open, I'm scoping, Hutch and his team
Clutching Dutches Backwoods, other shits working, not perfect
Flipping discussions, cussing all froze with slush, kid
Lacer had the drop, pass the Glock, Woosie uzi
The car hard bluesy with the pay me mean 'Bach
Cream shot, clean slot, one in his dome, four shock
He partially zoned, his dome fell on the rock
His face dazzle, niggas baffle, son, hit the floor, he traveled
Yo, to a new land, I cracked his cerebellum
Wide open, open the crowd up, he fouled up, black laid in the hall
For like forty-five to an hour, soaking

Sound of the smoking barrel, live like them older stars
Scrooge like a Christmas Carol, stemmed from a bloody love
Shot through the old apparel, no police to respond
Dropped off the Verrazano, washed up On Golden Pond
Just like a Shakespeare novel, more problems to dissolve
If this is destiny, that's how this world revolves

Aiyo, it's real, better pop your steel
Cop those wheels, shop those deals
Full time with the grind for a meal
Stay down low like O'Neal
Rain, hail, snow or shine, put time on the field
Police ride on my heels
Still big time, big dime, how you feel
I rhyme but the nine stay peel
I, zone on roam, floss with the chrome on chrome
Host on the corner store
S.I.N.Y. on my own, it gets foul, but I call it home
Live red bone give me dome, champagne toast to Tone
Roll a bone, a homegrown with Capone
Cause more rips to the o-zone, wanna ride with a nigga then hold on

The place was very smokey and cloudy, the full lousy
Music was emotional, people vibes was laid back and far from rowdy
She sit at the bar, holding a glass, sipping on a drink
Tears flowing like water from a sink, her eyes never blink
Her cigarette was burnt to the butt, her wrist was wearing a cut
Her facial expression was saying ""now what""
Another drink was made, each and every time the bass was played
Bartender telling her to go, but then she only stayed
Riding on the borderline, between homicidal, suicidal
Just hours from the headlines, the story with the grim title
She questioned her reason for being here, but even with
Four kids at home alone, it still remains unclear
Opens up a bottle of prescribed drugs and grabs a mug
Down, every one of those pills, since she was feeling bugged
Kinda weak, she stumbled from her seat, but she will never return
I guess it must of been a, lesson to learn",https://genius.com/Raekwon-rockstars-lyrics

How long is your CREAM? This long?

Eh yo, his belt got karats in it
Swift description, E-320 nigga pitchin
Rock a raw dinosaur chain, hang to his thing
It's like, he pump isolated, still cashin in CREAM
Niggas in the hood hate him, drew a vase of him
Blaze 'em, he actin like Shallah raisin him
This is hydrogen, son ain't live as him
He like Maguyver in the chin 4 spies with him
Roll relentless, desert that he hold is a gift wish
Shash the list, give his miss dick

Nigga like Nicolas Cage with the gauge in your braids
2 cannons that'll spray, rockin banana suede
Suck this drunk alcohol dick
Fuck y'all niggas with hits
We bout to shit on y'all shit

Y'all brothas wanna call us out?
Name names, otherwise it'd be the best to shut the fuck up
Get pimp-smacked up, jacked up and macked up
You're scared and froze of bein exposed
I own Harlem, I bone Harlem, call me the mayor
It's my borough, you don't want no problems
I'm on now, you dead pop, all jokes aside
I ride the top, you glide the bottom
Pitfall, 5 foot 9, my dick, balls
Shit y'all, leave flat line to stick your's
We flip off basic and brace it
8 kills, 47 ways to taste it
Never understand what you never been told
You did your book bitin off of my scrolls
We hit man, Colombo, coats and hats to match
Bust off quick, and then, guns go back

I move like Arthur Ash against God
4 raquets, 8 balls and no practice
Every cypher's a heated discussion
The industry was like a beat that needed precussion
I brun the music, shit that make crews flip
State that I'm the illest, this is Q.U. shit
I used to heat-hole, now I'm takin over like the repo'
Bitches that roll, Cee-Lo that'll sniff a kilo'
We went from franks and beans to shanks and greens
Now we drive our Navigators to banks in Queen's
Y'all can't fuck around, your words ain't right
Every time I touch the mic, they say ""Perb ain't right""
But that's the truth though, d'oh, infact that's it
When they drop this shit, I'm gon' cop that shit
The new star, you want me? I'm at the juice bar
Y'all once hap' niggas, give me 2 stars

I heard what y'all rappin about, but bring your stash out
You shouldn't throw rocks if you livin in glass house
Sneak your weak shit at us, on the low though
Where these cats come from, speakin about po'
We got cash to cop it and crash it {*car crashing*}
But half of y'all cats just catchin up to Rae' last year
Got guns in the jungle, call 'em Jurassic
The chrome, the steel, the 20-shot plastic
While y'all niggas cop jars, me and my niggas cop bars
Gettin head from rock stars
We blowin everything apart, I'm smashin the charts
How I see it? (Yo, how you see it?)

Eh yo, what you wanna be when you grow up?
Yo, I wanna be a leader
Slow your speed up and stop tryin to be us
Say somethin always, got a future? Stay out the hallways
And get yourself right, a 100 more ways

Fly like iceberg, nice with verbs, precise words
Bently swerve, hit the curb, jump out, cock back, spit out
Shut your block down, get out, criminal route
Gangsta shit, can't talk now, gun in your mouth
Cream Team killas, cacoon cats like caterpillars
Giant size gorillas, break niggas backs from the skrilla
Scratch, greenback track, Fed's berserk
That's my word, disrespect Recca, get what you deserve
Inferno, melt down mic's, millionaire in my afterlife
Broke bread with Christ on the last night

I said good morning to Toronto and woke it up
Wake up, bitch I'm here, it ain't a secret
My third eye twitching, the way I peeped it
A G's incense when the weed lit
And keep the white girls moving like the peach pit
That's some deep shit, I do it for my dawgs like I breed pits
Cream polo, matching clean kits
College rings got a nigga feeling like a genius
Paranoid of the lights when they flashing
Cash out big, money cashing, flow's everlasting
Swag like my passion is fashion

Teflon king
A scientist at ringing
Buddha trooper jumped out the Uber
Eating grouper
Party with bitches and cougars
Peter Luger’s, that’s my spot
Sixty dollar shots, I’m high off the hookahs
Play the backseat and front
Come through the Rucker with two fuckers
Shawty in blonde streaks, my homie we on peace
Just here coolin’, everyday movement
Hit the booth, classics for niggas that don’t know what they doin’
To the dead, toast to it
Pop toast to it
Drink Ballentine, L’s, I knew it
Sippin’ Lance’s in the mansions
Hundreds of chances to win
Drug game is ruptured now drim 
Now drink some Jim or some Jack
Black weed in a black V

I feel my world starts turning topsy-turvy
And I just can’t fight the spin
Baby, won’t you listen to this love
Whose hearts been missing and don’t hurt me
‘Cause I’m falling your way again
Am I weak
Well, sometimes I just can’t hardly speak
That I have to pinch myself to be sure
That this love is more than I can endure
Sweet thing, you’ve got me signing

See a bitch in seconds an assumed that I could rip her
None hipper, copped kicks with the zippers
The Filas arrived, it was Levis and high
In V Tracks I was simply the mack
Everything I snatched had to match with the hat
Reebok rocker, whole crew couldn't knock us
Fuck who, only thing to do was just Glock us
Valley Competitions and the Jordans hit stores
I'm sitting reminiscing, T. La Rock it's yours
Now fast forward time nigga still on the grind
Haters everywhere, nigga still gotta shine
Guccis all kinds, switch 'em up for the weather
Louis' in lime, Only do it for the pleasure
Come fresher, from the tech on the dresser
Fifth in the waist, still crys'd and I'm laced

Could It Be I’m Falling In Love,We Wanna Thank You,2014,"Wow I smelt the pussy up, awesome
I came with a bang, filled the condom up, Rae you a bossman
Right in front of Saks, flagging me like she knew me for years
I’m from academies where niggas dress casually
Ass was thunder, hips curvy, the wizzy was thirty
Dizzy bird who worked the Walt Disney in Germany
Fly green eyes, a black woman
Known to attack men, catch them in their lies, call it perjury
Dress her ass off and dance
An R&B queen who love hard niggas rhyming, she a fan
Everyday we fuck, I’m intrigued by that
Her outfits was mean, she went to sleep in
I fiends for that then we fuck, fuck
Boo let me get some juice, what what
Keep it moving just fuck me, that’s enough, enough
Fuck me in my ass and I bust
Busted on her ass, I’m in lust

Since I met you, I’ve begun to feel so strange
Every time I speak your name, that’s funny
You say that you are so helpless too
That you don’t know what to do
Each night I pray there will never come a day
When you up and take your love away
Say you feel the same way too
And I wonder what it is I feel for you

(Could it be I’m falling in love?)
With you, baby
(Could it be I’m falling in love?)
Woo
(Could it be I’m falling in love?)
With you
With you
With you
(With you)

I don’t need all those things that used to bring me joy
You’ve made me such a happy boy
And honey, you’ll always be the only for me
Meeting you was my destiny
You can be sure I will never let you down
When you need me I’ll be around
And darling you’ll always be the only for me

Catch me south France lumberjack mink bunch of snow cones

I've been watching, I've been learning
It seems like I've been hustling for years
Now that I've got my earnings
I wanna get away from here
Cause as the world keeps turning
I'mma get mine I swear

Pull them off the lot, let's race 'em
I'm here to break the set to the break who can take 'em

The scratch that he flaunts, nightmares he haunts

Cause life is sweet you spread your wings
The land, the kings, we get right and handle things, you hear?
Like pieces on the board
And my quest for peace is what made me a warlord, dig it?
Spit bars exquisite
No lies, I live it
No telling which island I plan to inhibit
Laid up with a bad bitch, choking on a cigar real far
Feeling stout pussy by the seashore
Smoking jacket and more broads
I'm here to get all yours
The prettiest one you pick, down on all fours


Hide the body, I got that hammers that hate you
Extended clips that's ungrateful
Only thing I could promise is your exit won't be graceful
I'm just hoping your necklace is tasteful
Put you to sleep, that's how I wake you
No alarm clock could ever wake you
I stay out late at night grinding for my payout
I shot my way in, I shoot my way out
That's if I have to, see how it play out
You have a better understanding for the day out

Playin Einstein lenses and Auroras

Couple of francs, peep the blue Taurus
What up tuck your chain they came for us
Jumped out big nines and some hard bottles
Eyes of hate finally meeting up wid the stakes
It was who I thought it was
2 pair of Clarks one pair of Lugz
Wit the hardbottom nigga wid the snub
Cocked it, where rock at, stop that
Violate this cipher pa we'll definitely strike back
All of us right there slight fear in our heart
Blink we take it right there
Doing our thing apart
Broad jumped out tryin' to run shit
Spoken loud words all we want is his head
He did some dumb shit
Beef from Miami now
Damn yo big head Lance in some wild shit
Noodles caught the stair down
Now it came back to me yo
Handle it wise and brutally yo
Put down your tooly and talk like men
No shots rang yo, hittin' the ground like mangoes

Yeah, runnin' through the stairs and shit
Trynna to get to the roof
Narcotos is on, some other shit

My niggas won't stop til we straight, select bigger gates
We won't stop until we buyin' estate, yo
Pull out them burners and front, where I'm from
Better shoot something, if not, niggas won't salute nothing

Corner filled chains and Gucci glasses
The was the era when we flipped all the shh, on the store, splashed it
Had Dominicans runnin' and eatin' steak and cheese sandwiches
They in the back, braggin', the fifth slut
Fuckin' with a few niggas nieces, take it back when we would
Rock for a leases and stand on the speakers
I got the shit locked, I'll battle you, you, you and your whole gridlocked
Little shit, supported the beef
Fly Pierre couldn't tell me nothin' with a brand new beard
Couldn't wait, but kept survivin' the years
We sold crack daily, crack mad bailey's, crack faces and skulls
Sit back, watchin' the mack, twist carefully
It was them horrifyin' times, spit dimes
Police sneak up, I hope he know the time, get mine
Just livin' the ghettos, where we suppose stand loyal
But the game'll get you trapped when it's time, yo


The year's 1990, everybody grimey
Crack was what's in it, the vehicles was 1-90's
Young shorties be gettin' their bread, haunted by Jamaicans
Them niggas had their corners on red
Map the laws, runnin' cards, playin' bars
Mask the coke in the cars, twist the gan', mad, crackin' cigars
Smokin' through Queens, bitches stealin' Guess jeans
Get the scope on our stars, little did we know, we folow they dreams
Now we get around in live limosines, flash stacks in cuisines
Combat, get to smackin' the fiends, just max for a minute and lean
All the shit for the moment, slick omens, my opponents would scheme
We were shot downtown, hit trains, buy cables and remain
The illest villains, walkin' in spots
Playin' the corners, baby, vision or not
Said yo, and when it's on, we gon' rep and rock, nobody call the cops


Where all the major swingers, yo
Where all the live fresh, came home, up state livin' fly rangers
We rep them niggas and we love 'em
Sons, we hug 'em, they make it home and be gone in a week
That's some letters, all my niggas live together
Baby yellin' whatever, we all write in hands, nothin' but creeps
Hold me down, love, I'll hold you fatter
Watch me catch both of these actors, it's Ice Water throwin' hits in the cling
Bloodhounds is on you, goons is beamin'
Take it to the team to team, plot thing, blew you a bean
It's just a young poor hustlers thing
But your gun got a ring, if you gonna live like a young kid

Caught carpel tunnel in your wrist I'll be damned

Back up, my spots is like leopards
I come through with shepherds
Shoulder strap on, black Louis black bombers
Yeah the police is scared and it's weird
400 thousand, take them there

From right in time when I was nine years old
I was a hot mess, smoking cheeba, running with stolen speakers
Dropped beepers, even wore a victory vest
I run with niggas, digging knots from niggas, running out the school
Stunting, back of the bus, flashing the ox
Rock the V-Gooses, everything we wore was name brand
Sold three lucy's, just to get on call plan

Even the Spin Doctors, sat and smoke blunts, I been bopping

We used to do what? Running through the sewers and then shopping
Pick pocket, deuce baby, take it in truce, baby
You know how we do, come run in my boots, baby
The niggas came through, touch the God, here Shallah
Ever since went from ninjas to gem stars, sing Rah


Reunited, another LP, we're all excited

Hands down, I can handle you, you half man, half animals
If you are what you eat, and eat pussy, you'se a cannibal

Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

Broke the top of goose-down sheets, kissed her on the neck
Real love, hope this ain't the last time we meet
Felt like a King who had a Queen want him
I usually deserve hotels, this one's the gift, slick
On our eye-to-eye contact, body movement, all on the grind
A lady's starin' at me, all in my mind
Sayin', ""Boo, I gotta live with you, let's connect and be a bridge""
You stay three forths and I'ma wiz you

Months ago.. you came to me
Told me... love me forever
See.. time has passed.. and lonely days
Have rid his head now.. stormy weather
But out of the rain.. came some delight
I ain't ashamed.. I know that it's right
The way that I'm feelin'..
He touches me.. in ways I like
Says things you won't.. won't day or night
Givin' me healin.. I'm leavin'
'Cause you wanted to know.. that is the reason

Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

The only set back in my state of grace
Is that.. the love is real.. for you and him
In different ways.. and
You're out in space.. yes here on Earth it's fun to play
I wish you were present so my love wouldn't go astray
And he gives what I need
Quenches my thirst when you say ""Girl, please""
That's a waste of my breath
It's funny to me.. that you get upset
And I told you quite often
I would fill up the space.. did ya think I was talkin'
Out the side of my neck..
You left me alone, what did you expect?

Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers
Drove me to arms of another

I'm dead in my sleep, she's standin' over the kid
I'm terrified, shorty was deep
I had my hand in her account plus livin' in a lab
Like a Count, I had to go six shorties was pink yo
She had the yolk on me that's when I went broke
We used to flip coke together, get boasted and float
We split real bread, we was large
We had our weddin' in the garage
And then she stopped reviewin' my bars
Hold up

Lately... I had a love that would ignite all the fire
The desire would leave, for you I'd admire
Lately... you seem all corrupt
I've had enough and you forced me to hide under covers

I walk around fly, high, telekinesis
And my lady a well known designer who fell in line with me
And all she do is sell LV
We in the grow house, trees look alone
I built the Dutch Master train set, relax, you home
And watchin’ Carmelo when the Knicks go in
I’m playing my square, I’m in the front row, my bitch roll in
That’s not wifey, that’s a lover
She gave me some top, but how we met, she was alone with my brother
Givin’ twenty-year veteran good dick, came to my senses
Stay strong like old man in dentures
Wintertime rockin’ the fox, hangin’ with Bruno Mars, 
The Lox
Sting, yo, 
Nas’ pops
We gettin’ honeys, Rat Pack clique in my gunny
Blowin’ two Ls, Ocean 11 this money
Floss stays coolin’ on them horses
Hoppin’ over logs, long Polo boots, ownin’ them Porsches
Maxin’ king, everything Gucci
Just like the suits I play Saturday to stay in Jacuzzis
Brother Man, I’m floatin’ to mother lands
And came back with ounces of gold, wrapped aside, rubber bands
Hangin’ in 
McCormick & Schmitz
Doin’ my OG thing, slangin’ some ‘caine in the mix

I’ll be flying to the islands when it’s cold outside
Matching furs, his and hers, got matching black cars
On my life, livin’ right, baby, love is no limit
Life’s good either way, 'long as you in this",https://genius.com/Raekwon-86-lyrics
"Whatever, Whenever",Lost Jewlry,2013.0,"Yeah, fly shit, man, word up, man
It’s that old motherfuckin’ laid back and
Leanin’ back on that good old alpaca
In the back of the vehicle and shit
Countin’ up motherfuckin’ 68 thousand
Two motherfuckin’ vests on the floor
Got mad reefer in the ash tray
Police put 17 cars away
You already know, man, shit is realer

Threw on the Harley leather sheepskin gloves, my Beretta
‘Bout to hit the ghetto, hard-body bring the kettle
Niggas is drinkin’ and gamblin’, all you see is hammers in my corner
Champion sweats, hoes in pajamas
7-50 new blue, this is my lady
She stay playin’ suits, mad cute, two 3-80s
And her cousin, a police who live in the east
I knew him from the fifth grade, he definitely is a beast
A thug smugglin’ cop who live in the ‘hood
Plus he rock a lot of Carhartt, Braveheart, die hard
The day I seen him, was the day they tried to rob him
They pulled out a flare gun, they shot out his charger
Yo, beast started simmerin’ at dice games and pubs
Niggas runnin’ up in alleyways gettin’ mugged
Niggas lucky, ‘cause them other niggas butt
I sat back, calm as fuck, enter the conference

Whatever, whenever
Just keep that thing up on you
Wherever, whenever
Whatever, whenever
Just keep that thing up on you
Wherever, whenever

Show ‘em how we position, all of the shit glisten
Stones flooded the Smith and, liquor, I’m reminiscing
Fiends are still sniffin’, sons are still in prison
My pen is still scriptin’ all of them ghetto visions
They gave me the contract, came where moms is at
Left a Audi 86 in the driveway in the mack
Felt like young Bond, Tom Forrest, slacks and metal lenses
Two polaroid pictures in front of his brother’s Benzes
His sisters was some hustlin’ dykes, bullyin’ niggas
Ridin’ around, mollied up, plus suspended licenses
Hit the stash box – right there, a hundred in cash
Left a blue steel muzzle in the glove box, yikes
4:40 that morning, it’s foggy, I’m under the Gotti
Louis jumper jacket, huntin’ hat cocky
Mad ‘cause I ain’t fuck that morning
I had a Korean-Malaysian black sister with a thunder back ridin’ me
Made it to the balcony part
Tossed the rope around the big lion head statue, climbed up remarkably
Right by the window, they there
Took a glance through, they covered in Versace covers
Fuckin’ in the mirror
Couldn’t see the faces, heard the moans
La Perla Draws hung off the sectional chair, cocked the chrome
Emptied the barrel, all you saw was goose down flyin’
The trigger felt like wind, it was two bitches lyin’ there",https://genius.com/Raekwon-whatever-whenever-lyrics
The Hood,The Lex Diamond Story,2003.0,"Some day, I know you'll be far away
I'll be right here to stay, give me one day
Baby, baby, don't, run away, come see me
Some day, I'll be right, here today, just give me love, Rae

To my hood, I'm always there for you
Rain, hail, sleet, snow, and I'm there
For all the underprivileged, yo we here
My life is all in your soul, daily, since nana left us
She took all of your blessings, cuz she been there
My life change, yo, could never though be without you, yo
It's strange when I want it to rain
On my best friend's grooming, we all had visions of you
We broke nights, God, knowing you cared
Peace, nigga, only for a minute and I'mma break out
Come back and kiss you on your feet, here
I love my hood, I love my niggas, there, yo
The older we get, we understand, you might tear


You keep the little young ones, happy, true
Graduations occured, you look so pretty and new
Look at the sky, all blue, all old people with you
Facilities mailing, jail brothers miss you
Wow, it gets crazy when I think about the money you made me
Slipped me away, but Jakes tried to rade me
Nighshifts, smokin' on spliffs, you kept yellin'
""Carry your fifth, the down the block niggas is gay""
They keep police invadin' your space, we can't live
Plus, they gassin' the mayor, them niggas wanna give you away
We won't have that, suburban people mad at the fact
That you be gettin' more company then them, they just be scared of that
""Hood"", look at your name, spell it backwards
Yo, ""Dooh"", that's what they yellin' in vain
You the realest, the most livest, flyest, you part of life
I gotta give you love, cuz you gave it God and life


Who ever said you ain't do right by me, they frontin', yo
They couldn't understand that we was a team
I used to come out, hear you words, talk to me, walk with me, brother
Cool, try to be succesful and dream
The city lights is on, now, they wanna turn 'em off
Try'nna start some shit, actin' like you never made a penny for 'em
Dun, they doin' you dirty, we had Summer Youth for that, though
No need to cry, never get worried
You gon' live forever, word to mother
Cuz she raised you right, and you got fifty-one brothers
I sat with the trees and had conversations at bees
We talked about throwin' money up, landscapin' your knees
You forget that, something to talk about
Show me where to take the check, pay these suckas off and be out
The'll never be another place, everybody happy to see
That's why I keep coming back to you, peace",https://genius.com/Raekwon-the-hood-lyrics
Never Used To Matter,Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II,2009.0,"""Never used to matter to you...""

We used to come down in the slab together, we hit the ave together
Them wood grain wheels we grabbed together
Had the same plugs, cooked out of the same kitchen
Hustle with the same thugs, on the same corners pitching
We hit the same clubs, my family and your squad
Bought all the bottles they had, we hit 'em so hard
Fifty G's on Friday night, sixty on the next
Hundred thousand dollar weekend, my nigga, we used to flex
Bad bitches for the sex, best weed for us to blow
Now with me you gotta plex, wanna take it toe to toe
Is it over a ho, over this work, over the dough?
Boy, you in over your head, and don't say I ain't told you so
You never been a soldier, bro, so don't try to front for me, man
Then lifting weights, acting like you He-Man, ain't G, man
Quit showing out, nigga, let's go and keep it true
I guess the shit that we been through (""Never used to matter to you..."")

Yo, we puff ounces together, I could of bounced and left you
When they through them shotties under your nephew
You know I stood there, back you down, and stood ground, was part of the plan
I thought it said (""Never used to matter to you..."")
You played it like you was the ringleader, you was a queen
Lost your manhood, you're off of the team
Don't ever come back, I'm spitting on you, shitting on you, no more sales
These shells got your name in script, I'm flipping on you
Corner drug nigga with priors, your gun never went off
In jail you was a liar, your wore wires
Stop fronting on the team, you're through, buy a gun, a crew
But overall it never (""Never used to matter to you..."")
We hustle for money, you hustle and funny
Gave you that name, hated my fame, you hated my chain
Now the chair turn, this is our view, coward you through
Don't try to say it never (""Never used to matter to you..."")
You fucking liar...

You need some tissue, man?
Yeah
Shit is just real right now because, yo, everything count man. Everywhere you walk, a nigga gon' judge your walk. But only you can judge yourself at the end of the day, knowin' what the fuck is you doin'. A lot of niggas gotta see that man, immobilizing is the best thing right now coming from whatever we came out of, you know?
Yeah, but they don't make cats like you no more, baby. It's a different breed out here, know what I'm sayin'?
Indeed so
The world is yours though, baby. The world is yours
We got a plan though
The world is yours
We have no interests, no investments in anything illegitimate. Don't ever underestimate the power of forgiveness. This is real shit right here, I'm tellin' you
Mr. Raekwon and his associates is prepared to deposit 500 million dollars in the Rap Vatican bank. Such times as Mr. Raekwon and his associates receive majority control of the Immobilarity
Immobilarity? Immobilarity could be somethin' new, baby. It's a international conglomerate. A few families have control of such companies. These are important things that a black man like myself and like others need to know. And that's gon' bring about nature. Nature takin' it's course. Come on, let's add on. What you feel?

Right, yo pull my Rover on the side
Right there police coming man
Heard me

Yo up in the game room 4 in the morning and it's storming and we blitzed
Just rocked another wig yeah we on it
God had blood on his sweat pants
The way the tech dance on a nigga face, son ain't have a chance
Seen him high pitch yellow nigga from outta town
A young mellow ally trying to run through
Hell, it's on called the dogs to get on him
And we caught him, only thing this nigga was a lord in his forum
Bum nigga fresh outta jail, I used to play baseball with him
'Til son got large—bought a whale
Azure by the entrance, guess it's real nigga night out
He moving on his own negligence
Yo Lexxy strap up meet you in the back in the Acura
Spectacular vic, he stackular
Seen a nigga gem-down, fresh haircut trying to swim now
Aqua green Avias on brim style wild
We walked by eyeing 'im
Shorty ain't looked he trying to get fly, my niggas ain't dived on him
Kaze had the Mac in the vest, the way he moving might be dressed
He made two rights nigga move left
Standing by the incinerator, thank God he a generator
I can tell, bought his lady suede gators
Yo now it's time to move, spin nozzles on the tools
Might just bust him quiet style rules
He walked out the crib, yup draped
We on the elevator baked, staring at the nigga chain shape
We looked at him, seen all crooked, then we flashed on him
He knew we was live, my man Boo spazzed on him
Pulled out, take off the wool, nigga cool out
Walk you out the bulding, betta run nigga move out
This nigga liver than fuck, larger than fuck
Better kill me, all y'all niggas is butt, what spray it up
Tuck the chains in, Kaze shot him at point blank range then
He started screaming like a cave man
Blood got a salty taste, I can tell furniture fell out his face
Laced now it's a case
Threw up, vomit on my coat piece
Snatched all his ice now, Chrome T, boatin' off low-key
Didn't know the kid was large
Hour later call from jail, Mexicans surrounding the gods
Chill you bigga than the ocean, slow motion
Play it off no emotion but my man in there grossing
What to do they might kill him
We might kill you circulate death, that's how the real do
We sat there 3 live macks of the year
Crack beers one nigga in the back washing off his track Airs
Don't take it serious, vivid flow luxurious
I'm hearing this'll, make a real nigga curious

Bet he won't never fly my way",https://genius.com/Raekwon-friday-lyrics

The Scroll,Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang,2011.0,"Regardless, we all ninjas, and got money
But the theme of the story
Is yo, checking how they came for me

Kinda brief from the gold teeth era
Bro dreaming on C.R.E.A.M
Complimentaries and beef
I'm from the wild side, a militant was made by the foremost elite
It sound good, brung my rifle shit, clean
Met the others, lit a blunt, begin
I'm like Nicole Kidman in the wind, niggas is wild, niggas is eat
Then I chanced it, blood can always beat mud
Mud is part of being thug, I guess it's advance, we from the street
This is me, I'm ready to beat, whatever, we gon' off' it
One time alone, yo, they pricked up 
Unique
Meth standing there, rare hustler hair, right in front of the building
Them niggas do them killings out there
This is deep, me, Rebel, U-G, he walked in the room
Scarf rap, pair of Timberlands, beat
This the potion, roll the scroll out, speaked and another walked in
Knowing now this is a thief
We from the same voc's, this is like a pot roast
Hottest niggas who rhyme, I know them from the time
This is not 'posed to happen
Peace Black, we wasn't cool
Threw the piece back, everything good, I lit the leaf, captain
Got a mission, to make sure the world recognize our position
I'm standing near the kitchen
Shit just might work, I lit the stink, this could be the realest shit
This could be the realest flip quick
Everybody stand up in militant, army jackets down
I said to myself, this the realest clique
True champ, we gon' rep it through, keep it cool
No boot camp, no hard work, just some loot, family
All in, ball til you fall, loyal as ever
I grab my leather, I'm a lay til you call

Generals, demons, nighttime, vultures
Caught up on the ropes, let's team it

 what you mean?
Everybody C.R.E.A.M.'in', the all American dream",https://genius.com/Raekwon-the-scroll-lyrics
Call of Duty,UnKnown,UnKnown,"This is a renegade salute, yeah we on that
And keep what we kill, yeah we on that
We never fightin’ we just cock and go click clack
Turn that ass ‘round, bring it all back
Know you see me
I know you see me
I know you see me

Everybody call me the top driver
Run it down to the end of the drive line
This is a callout, callout, callout
Are you ready for the massacre?
Somebody throwing down, down, down, down
Sirens blaring, but they can’t help you now
Sirens, can’t help you now

Murder by numbers in Monaco
Me all fresh to death, big white thing go kinda slow
Got my elites in the suites, my stones is roughed up
Camouflage pants, my gold cheek
When we go, yo, we go together
Whatever is said, it’s still combat boots on the door
Still get a million a week, got the lions in the yard
Barbeque and breadsticks and chic
Fly generals, international, rational raps
Who kill like ten percent of these rats
My team thumpin’ in the crunches
We fucks with the hard, not anything else just hard


Tiger claw scar on his neck, rockin’ links
Mad Bull PTS riles and minks
Soldiers and gorillas fall fast in the paint
Protect the projects, intersections, and inks
You still prove gooses are we mooses?
Ears and eyes, mad jury on that blare like acoustics
Kill, kill, kill, kill, yeah more, while she's dying to feel
Soldier ceremony, we gon' go with horses
Nobody dying tonight, cause I said so
More gold chariots, fly back, we fly home
Sit back blinded in the cabin, General Bang
Hundred medals on his chest, neck and stab him


(Revolutionary) What is it like to be helpless?
When you're laying there hungry, yeah
Feel the pain and you're half dead
Not a game, no contest
And no matter how strong you are
Thought that you could be

Yo, it seem like niggas want war again
If you ain't know, bet ya niggas heard of me now
Can't stop me, best bet, murder me now

Aiyo Lex, put ya diamonds on
Grab ya vests and ya nine, cuz it's on
I rep Harlem World where they hustle at
All the way to B.K. where they bust you at

Yo, yo, gun on 'em in the x-rays
Real niggas lay tired of it
Nigga violate it, cut him in the face
Vivid hand Glock, loopin' the dance, shoot him in the ass
Like cupid, dealin with an old place, stupid

Yo, yo, ain't a team allowed to know, fuckin' wit this
Niggas mad like I'm fuckin' they chick
See me stuck in the whip, gun in the hip, one in the head
Ten in the clip, niggas is dead, they imposters

I used to bubble dimes, in the goose, I use to cuddle nines
And double the fact that you dare think that you can trouble mines
Big guns is layin', Timothy McVeigh 'em
Broad day 'em, push 'em all the way in

Aiyo, dred's in the bloody rep
Yeah, yellow canary Lex', specs on, movin' like vets
Tri-boro, thoroughest thugs move like DeNiro
Heat out, extortin' the heroes, 4/5 singles

Aiyo let's go get dough
Bust slugs in the club, thugs get low
Bitches showin' me the thong like I'm Sisqo
Up in the six, yo, watch his wrist glow, damn, it be sick though
This be the shit though
You ain't know, got ya moms in the disco
Singin' the intro, shakin' the ass like the nympho
Time to move, nigga, we in, time to catch wins

For magical mixes, remix the hell outta the Bible
Like strip it and switch the whole title
Robes hit the floors, shoes is buffed
Gold studded bracelets, handcuffs, they gave it up

Teach niggas how to resolve a big mob
Keep niggas on beat, fuck around and di-ie the mid-ob
Niggas gonna bump what, yeah, you wit it whatever
Let's body these niggas, a lot of niggas bump, yeah

Yo, yo, never been the type to hold a grudge
Did five, I was guilty, fuck the judge
The Ave. got mad when I slid back through
Iced out, just came home and I blew

We like, them frisky, rich and poet-esque
If it's chilly on our neck, then it's cold on our wrists
The cash flow is nuts, come through 8th Ave
Another hundred style, burn out for doughin' us

Aiyo, the hood's off the hook, hooded up crooks
Play the back burner wit black burners layin' for the juks
I'm too live, heats be the same as my shoe size
Fresh out the box, just copped a pair of new nines

Yo, my team is like nitro, it might go boom when the lights blow
Catch you in the spinal wit the same knife from Psycho
My mic flow like Michael on the ball court
All pro, result of this Cream Team, niggas is all out


Aiyo, rep for ya town (""Get ya shit beaten"")
Uptown, break it down (""Get ya shit beaten"")
Staten Island, break it down (""Get ya shit beaten"")

Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list, Rae gave them niggas cake
Battle the gun, you're wildin'

Half the bone out, halfway home, it's on now

Cats be telling on kids, do or die, son
Cats that run with you, dumb out, puff blunts with you
Cats be telling on kids, now that ain't love son
Cats be feeling you, then what, be grilling you
Cats be fronting on kids, Lex, you live, son

Learn how to bust these, gemmed out, yo Killa lust these
Try not to trust these, I'm six Guyanese, dust these
Set up to fuck these, good luck, trees rolling out with rugbies
You love these, certified thugs, blowing up g's
We all that, commissioner don rap, with the arm at
Set up saloons, bring pawns where we want at
Reward that, Oscar Award, applaud that
We like Hardcastle and McCormack, set up the floor mat
Splash four hat, Similac cats, tour rap
Faggot-ville, where other reals won't ball at
React tours that, Hillfinger drawers, Wu hat
Relax do that, whoever boo trash, two at
Beige or blue hat, suede wally shoe, lashin' Clue at
White folks, come out your night clothes, sliding through that",https://genius.com/Raekwon-kids-thats-rich-lyrics

Ok, what I did for you guys in Freedomtown, what was that?

Return of the kitchen kid, with the axe
All I know is real detail, coke, lasagna and them E pills
Million dollar merchandise, we on, get ya groove back
A hundred yukons, we all moving crack
All my soldiers got big rank, pa, Sicily money
Y'all had a bitch that got pregnant in Iraq
What's the movement? Superman money in the Ooh building
A few dudes who make a lotta rules sayin' 'you get it'
Right, wavy hair, all my niggas is polic'
You stay off the roof, or jakes see the crib
No snitchin', this Amityville detention
Might fuck around, get caught, or shot down, play position

This is raw way, lookin' in his eyes, and he butt
Yo, what's happenin'? I heard you got the streets back, captain
Yup, all niggas is dead, unless they team clappin' something

Take your sweatpants off, fix your mascara
Four hundred nineteen ounces, out in Long Island
Twelve strong bitches that's real, who not scared of housing
Yes, throw on them raccoon, chinchilla feathers
Let it drag on my boots, the jean burned leather
Jog through the back of the building, drop the L
Got the scope on your nosey ass mother, fuckin' up sales
Forty karat locked in, bowtie, chillin' at the Democrat party
Yo, Chef, your coat, got it poppin'
Coming soon, Purple Tape
, circle up the city let 'em know I'm back
Four hundred bricks, and yup, the kids stance
Sponsored by my cousin in Stan', maintainin'
Got the call from Tony Young Montana, my son campaignin'
Yup, I'm not no fuckin' bellboy, I war anything out there
The ring is mine, you can tell Roy
That's when I was hit with the call, your whole motto is get tour
Drug rap owner, you will rip all
Live like the pope, and get a big hall
Flipped them a claren, the front, like the Jag back like the store

Yo son, you got my shit?

Son you ain't got my shit?
(Nah, nigga, I ain't got ya shit)
Yo, son, my shit is gone
(Pah listen, I ain't got ya shit
Lex you sure you ain't leave it in the..)

I started buggin out, fell in the zone, half the bone lit
Passed off, rubbin on my ski hat - oh shit!
My blunt fell, my watch, you seen it?
Gleamin little young fella, he just had the stupidest look, weeded
Yo, I'm tired and stressed, hungry and I'm vexed
And I'm flippin cause these niggas wanna play me for test
Shit fell off ya hand Lord? Stop it, I'm eyein niggas in they faces
After that I'm goin at niggas pockets
The watch, faggot yeah, y'all niggas got my shit
""Yo Lex we family, I helped you cop yo' shit""
Then help me find my shit!
Eye-ballin every fake Frankie Lymon in the joint
Break out, find my shit!
Yeah, yo now I got robbed, I smell it
Mad bitches walkin' by the fella tryin' to crochet, bitch spell it!
Listen trick, be out, bounce
Blew an ounce off of weed in the bitch face, she pulled out two white owls
""Everybody back the fuck up, move!
Chef, you actin' like a loose cannon, Pah, with you and your dudes""
If my shit come up, cool
Matter of fact, clack-clack-clack-clack, niggas pulled out tools

Yo yo yo yo turn the fuckin' lights off
Pass the illumin' Lord, tell the DJ turn the fuckin' music off
We got announcements, we want y'all to listen clear
We just lose about mansion in here
And yo eh yo if we don't get it back it's gon' be a problem
Then my niggas gon' react and that'll be a problem
Eighty-five thou' gone we got a fuckin' problem
Ain't nobody leavin' alive until we find 'em

Excuse me, Miss, no I ain't havin' it
I smacked him with the four pound, bitch hit the ground
Then I stepped off, dry mouth and shit
Equipped with the dipped courdouroy Bailey's with the cream stitch
Powerhouse biscuits that blow roofs off
Rae watch is missin', you take ya boots off
And take off those chaaaaaiiiiiiinnnns
The fat fuck thought I was playin' so I started sprayin
Chicks hit the floor, bottles broke
The owner slid through beefin', duke threw the toast to his throat
We brought the noise like we here to promote
My man don't get his shit in four or five minutes yo we're leavin' with the vote
A gangsta's lotto, thirteen bodies and still climbin
Big shotties, bodied when they sniff body
We did our thing too we got to the Envy lobby
Our last four or five shots we see nobody


Eh yo shit got real that night
Power grabbed him, 'Vine smacked him dead in his head
(Oh shit, nigga he got a magnum!)
Yo we all holdin', rollin
Grab a nigga, search him if he front, fuck it, blow him!
Watchin' niggas foldin
The bartender got a shotgun in his hand
Let off, the wheelchair nigga got up and ran
Surround the Don, full body armor automatically on
The faggots passed off the watch and gone
(yo y'all niggas ain't searchin' shit!)
Yo where the big mouth at? Niggas step up
Matter of fact nigga, lie the fuck up
Nigga tried to swing on G's but he a gentleman
Son, he dropped the dead arm but failed to see it
Two shot G's pealed his meat {*starts to fade out*}
Let's see, niggas tried to front like my niggas is weak
Corey pulled the truck up, C-4ed this bitch, blew it the fuck up!

First time nailing me, realer than the obvious
They never said it was gonna be easy
Who can y'all put up with?
The streets... why you coming at me like that, man?
You payin' him? You taking care of me?
What's the matter with you, man?
See this the shit that make a nigga don't come over, man

Aiyo, fly shorty Penelope, fresh female chick
Straight outta jail, first time mailing me, God
Realer than the obvious, livelyness was on the line
I mean like, the sweetest thing, most seen her kind

Bloomingdale patient, slick finance who got a Benz station
Studying law, buying North Faces
Tried by the police, yo, straight up and down
I hold rollies, size six shaconies, daughter, might name her Water
Son, might name him Rich Porter, style, Law &  Order
Copped them quarters, it's real, blowing out in Florida
Displaying a game, frame, I'm adoring her
Blasting music, I'mma lose it, shorty romance the music
Just grind, don't dance to it, flexin' with a sun dress on
Shorty refreshin', less you stressed, stop swarmin' on her
Yellin', it's all made basic, taste it
Anybody lace this here, you can blaze it
Rinaldo stepped up, what, ""Lex, you know I got it lined up""
Bust ya gun from the side, what?
Take this thought in mound, your frame might be a dime
But the brain power might not shine
Shorty had a good head once, rolling up blunts, damn
She fucked up, got caught in the crunch
Now, down go her lifestyle
She on the FDR now, with a Audi J, bugging out
Stop that drinking, you wild, project chick, yo
Won't even tuck her chain, nigga, that's foul
Got caught up in the number run, dunn
I need to get my life back, son, share one
Lex laid it out, but she stunt, enter and still smoke blunts
Shit ain't real, she yelling ""Fuck everyone""
Yup, caught up in the midst, I mean glitz
Went from doorags to rich, now he blue hat and switch
I guess, the live way to rap it, shorty went backwards
Now she stuck with a dirty Guess jacket
Keep on, giving out the jewels wrong
Who wrong? Who want? Who trynna-trynna act like you never knew wrong
Now it's raining, now I'm maintining, gaining
Probably gaming with positive aiming, long dane it
Stepped in, jumped in the car, fuck God
Put the Wisdom for Knowledge, you bond, whine too hard
Shaking her ass, walking out to the garage, you large
Fuck men, fuck who weighing nods
Stopped, took a peak at the stars, the Zodiac, a fine Mars
Or lose it for a chick behind bars
Wash, waking up Lars, aiyo collect call Taj'
Let's take a half a million in the cards
Laying up, at the Laborage, say I need a massage
Stressed, jumping out the Guess jumper, charged
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo
Wifey material, make sure y'all observe the ariel
I'm mailing this through ya stereo

Benetton sweaters, Kangols and guns
The candy shop is where it all popped
Sellin' ounces of oregano
, free lunch, the spot
Thinkin' all better, can't wait to bag this block
Cause when I get on, my ass is just rock
Do a few 1-2s and shop
I get whore who's runnin' through 5th Ave, a Glock
I love Polo Gear and top
A few Woolrich pieces, yeah the  was hot
Dreams and schemes to make a knot
I sat on the stove and wrote ""C.R.E.A.M.,"" one blunt 2 o'clock
Gangsta hours if I'm not
I'm lyin', take a shot, I put it on my 40K rock
Shorty with an educated bop
With flavor for days, it's all praise, who amaze you a lot

Front out of drug buildings under the street lights
Guns go off, we keep pipes
Every kid caught in the zone, let's hope he make it home
And sleep right, instead of churnin' the heat night

Ayo maxin' with the machine guns, new 
Tryna stay away from the jail gangs and letters
My time is now, bread box is startin' to pile
Homegirl got no style but I'ma lace her
Catch me in a Blazer with a P9 laser
Drunk get 25 thousand a razor
Meet me in the mess hall
, you crazy, I'm out in Jamaica
Breakin' up black weed, chillin' with gangstas
Fuck around high, might die on vacation
Better have respect in the right place like

He told the God, hit the booth and start spittin
At first it was a dream to me,

Then move you from a block to a home
We came from nothin', seein' how the world is so cold
Some niggas comin' out of churches sellin' devil their soul, yo

It's time to rebuild, teach our seeds, that guns don't kill
It's the nigga behind the trigger that will
Society's ill, blacks support seeds for their mills
Mentally brainwashed, time moves on, we stand still
I seen life through the birth of my son, I seen it all again
A soldier stuck in these streets, hopin' it's war within
Too late to fall now, I'm on now
Niggas is born now, we doin' good, we on tour now
Elevate your prosperity, I'm seein' shit with clarity
No longer on the low, pa, I couldn't handle thieves
Too much to live for, I just wanna poly and grow
Stack ones and watch my little dun's blow

Yes I got you started all over again

Chef It Up,The Appetition,2020.0,"Yeah, yeah, yeah
Word
Yeah
Jump into the movie
Let's go

Flex around town with the powerful flow in the latest
I'm like a jag, more spots, more courageous
I'm here, I never left, the chef blade henchman
Rep with a thousand one trenchmen
We all wearin' sweats, Gillettes, and oxes, more foxes
Coolin' on top of the spots holdin' choppers
Some new Jordan 6s in the six
Fly niggas fuck this, fuck that
My winners get enough that
Teflon Dons and pimps, pop models
Louis goggles and the S class blast, don't hit the potholes
We racin', everything's laced, here's the ratio
Now bust that down, let's get more fellatio

Chandeliers on the throats, we still chef it up
We heal niggas with notes, we stay weapon up
Over the pots and stoves, we still chef it up
Through the valley of hopes we stay flexin', what?
Chandeliers on the throats, we still chef it up
We heal niggas with notes, we stay weapon up
Over the pots and stoves, we still chef it up
Through the valley of hopes we  stay flexin', what?

Grass get lit in bamboo, the band new
I will be one of the elites in the streets
Stores where fours get bought we open up wars
Some swords get caught, some broads got bored
Next level, new level, it's gods against devils
Czars against rebels, we never been flipped
Army brigades with blades on, all types of niggas catch fades
In the middle of the street in the yellow line
The timin' is massive, let's run to the parade
Bangkok hammers get blazed
It's in the streets, be amazed
How young homies turn into slaves
Eat that nigga for days, what

Chandeliers on the throats, we still chef it up
We heal niggas with notes, we stay weapon up
Over the pots and stoves, we still chef it up
Through the valley of hopes we stay flexin', what?
Chandeliers on the throats, we still chef it up
We heal niggas with notes, we stay weapon up
Over the pots and stoves, we still chef it up
Through the valley of hopes we  stay flexin', what?

And besides, see I never had a million
Got beefs that got millions and in buy-outs worth billions
Knotty nigga with a plan platinum jam
Found a million fans in the Lexus to the Lands
So whose the cat in the comfy black Ac?
As a matter of fact, I sick/six fingers I'm from fat
My projects be the livest that it gets
Watch me ---- back Tex and do murders in the backsteps
I want that b---h with a Lex, a house out in New Mex
She disrespect, she buys a Rolex

Flawless,We Wanna Thank You,2014.0,"Ever since I was 13, my biggest problem has been just to find the right road to get to that rainbow that everybody talks about
Like most people get close enough to count the stripes
But they don't have enough guts to reach out and take that pot of gold
What up my dude, you know
Going through a lot and all that man
That's why you be strong, you know what I'm saying
Feel great boy (Staten Island over yeah)
It's going now ()
Holla at the kid
(Let's go chef)

I'm flawless, the gowns that I rock is cashmere
Then roam through the lab with the hammer and black Airs
Thinking 'bout plans that's real, laying the bill
Drop a new classic album, my masters will
Enlighten your mind, I'm writing on times
When the youth reach real situations and they thoughts are blind
You know when I float a moment is fine, glass of wine
New elegance, the greeze just pass through the mind again
What happened, rap made it happen, back when
Two turn tables and a needle, action
We all huddled up, that's it, classic shit
Only our kind adapt to shit
Start rapping 'bout cracks and Pimps, cash to get
Call it C.R.E.A.M. now, no grind don't ask for shit
We bastard thick, pass the spliff

Name of this piece is called ""my bitch better have my money"" (applause)

I'mma leave you left, freezing and naked
Silverback gorillas, taught to bite tongues out faces

Dominican complexion with some hard ice
Can't nothing rock me, I'm legendary

I can make it happen, only one to hold you down

A good woman that'll treat you right
I'm the one to hold you down

Ay yo, come here young lady with the skin of a baby
Who dress like a Wall Street woman, you ?
I know your family, they my people for life
Had a beef behind the wall, one of your cousins, he threw me a knife
But that's yesteryears, life is intact
Been battin', quit rappin'
But I'm just reactin', your body packin'
I know not to ask a woman's age, but it's crazy these days
No time for slipups, the industry is crazy
Bloodhounds chasin' these girls
Girls chasin' these birds, they say whips we see curves
But I need one with knowledge and self
And whole word, say word
Yo hop inside the Aston, put your feet on the fur
Let's talk, put the Birkin in the back by the door
Don't put it on the floor, it's bad luck so don't fold
You've got a strong aura I'm digging this snow ?

Came back,  ain't nothin' sweet
My dome is yellin', ""Go home!"" but I ain't through
So many years in my career, it's a long route
Thinkin' when  skinned his face on the plaster
We was dusted back then, I smoked the last of it
And jumped into the Acura, sleepin' at , what it do?
Stew, beef, chicken, where my boo?
Had a quarrel with a hood rockstar, I broke his arm off
Cause he was pointin' his fingers at Ivanne's daughter

I wasn't stupid, I was ruthless

Dred upstairs
Passing all packs escorted from Kinetta ear
Yo the nigga's name unknown
Kingston, had it sown
Never rocked the combs
His wig was big
Rob robs on the side , little lucky charm
Dred with jars , flooded graveyard
Brown clarks on
Playin feds in the shark bar (Allahu Akbar)
With another dred named Gov
Both diamond jimmed out
Rockin rentals , spittin phlegm out
Sucked his teeth , two fingers pointin down
What up bonna , passing marijuana to Tanya
CEO of Benny-Hanna , He fucked , sent her to Ghana
He's Benz nigga , rocked shorts , beige Tims nigga he real
Took us to Switzerland , dressed us all ill
Smoking ganja , rocked Anacondas , on next border Elantra
Sent it to his mama
Now that's a major move , the nigga love family
Wouldn't hand me no drugs , showed me his jammi
Bulldog Stanley
Flexin on kinal , sit down , do it Chinese style
On graduation day he threw me a thous
He came through , heavy like fuck , suit flammable
Ill pair of gators he copped in Beirut
Had his man wit him , just stare , don't stand wit him
If assassination strike , he gotta make plans wit him
Roll a joint , keep him on point ?Don Troing poing coin?
Freaked it , members like that I wanna join
The next day I heard he got knocked , fucked me all up
We felt it on the block , let the seeds rock
Peep what the nigga got rocked for
Smuggling dust in Rushmore , four more he went to war for

Wu Crime,Shaolin vs. Wu-Tang,2011.0,"Yo, there's a rumor that an inmate heard
Salesman hiring, a convict of murder
Bodyguard, he used to use physical fitness
His business, catching and terrifying the witness
In the gym is where he gained his powers
Boss was the pizzeria owner that rolled flour
A made man, it felt good to be made
Turned murderer, extremely quick to upgrade
But he still baked pies and his cake would rise
Like his enemy, he watched to take dives
Allies would retaliate, at least even the score
Had a thousand guns they would calibrate
He sort a loss, if devil crossed
Moved on 'em swiftly, if worlds away set the shuttle off
Horror in the ville without the Amity
Scars upon the grill of your friend's family
Workers utilized then brutalized
Performance scrutinized then crucified
Wakes, fire bombs, function's shot up
The jakes was not alarmed, but damned is the product

Shooters mans, grizzlies stands up in the GT
Klansman with the sword that'll blow up a van
When the people's come, blow right past
Mind your business, I don't know nothin'
They found his ho in the trash
Barbecue wings, blings for my niggas that's true kings
Sit up in the crib, catch somethin' and screw fiends, yeah
Watchin' me, next time scotch me
I drink Cristal liquor, I'm a version of Hitler
On wax, no 'dacks just water
A du-rag on, I scratch waves sayin' niggas is trash
Yo, learn how to write, beware
I pull up, he here
I should've known I had a clone, see weird niggas'll get irked
Murked, dropped off in a new turf
Trunk full of Siamese rats and gnats yo
I do it for the cats and pits and all the bitches with big tits
Five hundred shoe game switch
Shake that shake, I bake
I live in the state that kill niggas over grits and steak
You might get smacked with a Mac 11
Or run off the road or shot in McDonalds for frontin' with fake niggas

Ay yo, Saladin vivid Wall Street sixteen
Muslims, kufis, uzis, the Wu is supreme
Ferociously I rank general a world's above self
Conspicuous crime make me grab the nine off the shelf
The dark hallways amazingly convenient
The phoenix with Jane, jugglin' cracks or playin' with ninas
Thug law of the streets, gangsters crave the beef to feast
Fiends with plates, a snake wanna eat
Gaze at the spectacular rapper, niggas is Dracula
Rap tours, Priest the hood ambassador
Passion for war, Wu-Massacre, threats, they never worry me
Plots to my death, mic jack conspiracy
Lyrically, I'm only afraid of my own ability
Words that shape into nuclear wars, we shooting through walls
Bringing down the mall, I ring around the store
Planets of the Apes, bandanas on our face
Hammers on our waist, cameras out in space
The nickel plate, fake armor, will harm ya'll snakes",https://genius.com/Raekwon-wu-crime-lyrics

On the strip tryin' to catch more cake than Oprah
I got clips that'll leave you with ya face on a poster
I talk slick and I'm sprayin' the toaster
Sparkin' shoot outs and start poppin' off shit the way I'm supposed to
You the type to go up North straight scrappin' a sore butt
And ain't nuttin' worse than gettin' shot as soon as you woke up
You got work? I'll be rapin' ya dolja
I'm takin' his pack and breakin' his back and makin' him throw up

Cuz ya bitch said she love the way the dick talk all in the cake
I need this bank money, throw me the safe
All these killas involved, the cops'll fuck around and chalk the place
Yo they wonder why we hang with crooks
Shit is take free, not used to money off the books
Broke faggot nigga caught in a juks
I'm a pirate in this rap shit, I leave you niggas off the hook

What the fuck you gon' do when we run in ya crib?
Either we leavin' with the bricks or we gon' leave with yo' kids
And they only got hours to live
So give up the ransom or find they ass up under the bridge
'Lite never been afraid, so keep lookin' niggas
Cuz I'll rob yo' ass faster than some Brooklyn niggas
Yo this rap game twisted, everybody beefin
Everybody killas now and ain't nobody leakin
Smoke a lot of weed so I don't like to fight

Now I slam it when I'm done, give me my ten G coat
To perform another song, cuz I won't let
Nobody press up and mess up, the scene I wet
I like to stand in the crowd, and watch niggas wonder
Damn, then think about, then you wonder
Clan, they just rag shit, rip shit, bruise shit
Maybe that's the rap shit, I gotta prove shit
Even if it's jazz or the quiet storm
Now flip the beat up, convert it to a hip hop joint
Write a rhyme and graffiti in, every show you see me in
Deep concentration, swift like the beamer, kid
Go with the crowd, while my lyrics spit flames
I flow-tate the vowel, cuz it's all in my veins
Another remedy, fly niggas is enemy
Cuz I'm live as some rap niggas with energy
Now do it, cuz I'mma put the nine on pause
My sharks beaming, catch you on the side of the store
Call your bluff, make you stare in my face, ya team suck
Remember me? The one you got your ideas from
How soon you start to suffer, until you get stuck up
When you start to fuck up, that's when you get bucked up
Bitin me, you think you dope, I smash your boat, with bad coke
You should of wrote, because I ain't no joke

It's been a long time, I shouldn't have let you
Without a re-up to connect to
Think of all the weak product you slept through
Time's up, I'm sorry I kept you

I was a fiend, before I was seventeen
I melt the microphone like blowing some evergreen
It's all in the making, from where hip hop was originated
Peace to the streets, the bubblers, mark & dated
Cuz I grab the mic, now I say ""yes ya'll""
Ya'll yell 'scrape it', then I'mma say 'let's ball'
Come on, cool, cuz I'mma get on rep
Twist a 'dro on the speaker, pull the snub and then flex
Back to them crabs, ya'll niggas had ya'll laughs
And then I spaz on the rhymes I splashed
From back to your brother gun, then I grab the double pump
Then this the opposite, and ask if another come
Cuz I'mma get busy, get dough with my team, yup
I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, rip up the stage and don't it amazing
Cuz every line is laid in
Caught up, thoughts are sort a, an addiction
Bags of pies, smell of bricks, kid
Vocals vocabulary, the stage is a suction
The mic is a draino, volcanos erupting

Every thing is written in the cold, slick & coin'

Fuckin with checks, throw the ringer on and blink out

For real, I shot niggas shakin' their hands, I'm ill

All ill technology to watch if I ran, he only gave me

Had made backs, eight labs, his date was Miss Mass-

Jabbed her and shot her in the back, I can't stand the bird

Gettin' lift ownin' Miami yo
Flips got bigger, makin' more trails
Set it out of nowhere when coppin' a jail, I'm eatin' fresh veal

The arsenal will have sixty three hundred murders
Livin' in apartments, wild he violated flight a Bianca
Took two hundred niggas down but two men houndin' him
The fuckin' cockroches posin' the on six million dollars sold
We're eatin' enchilada, goat cheese pasta
Yeah we're drippin' it with more salsa
And then they rushed in, found him on the roof dead in his boxers

I got to admit that Shaolin boxing ain't that bad!
But, now watch mine!

Ya'll niggas food, I peep that shit a long time ago
Dick rider niggas trying to front like they grimey, tho
This is my world, I just let you live in it
But the lease is up, you faggot niggas get evicted
How many times I gotta tell you cowards, mind your business
Oh, you still yapping? Time to catch 'em slipping
Doing dirty, we don't mind getting our hands dirty
And you can't fuck with any bitch because her ass dirty
Cuz when it pop off, we just up in shorty ears
And you just stuck with it, and how us niggas got you there
That little bad caramel with the long hair
Got you lined up, and caught in the crosshair
Nothing but bosses here, we enforced the fear
Always in the hood, my office there
Blow a bag with my comrades, polly my next move
And have you niggas bugging, how I wet 'em and crept through",https://genius.com/Raekwon-your-world-and-my-world-lyrics
A Rainy Day,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Just to let you know
Sometimes it takes a rainy day
Sometimes it takes a rainy day

A-yo, your skin color's the shit
Bubble when your back look delicious
My strawberry queen, Nestle quick, slide through Geneva
Switching gears on me, I’mma leave her
She driving her own shit, she a keeper
Then clip jury on, live in the woods
What’s good? No Hollywood, whole shit, yeah, you good
Sipping drinks, rocking minks, come visit the shrink
Check crib, it’s bigger than Liv
What you think? I’m just a part time romancer
See me in the club, I’m a ransom
Time me up boo, I go against you and I queen that I want
She gotta think like a king, respect mine
Boo stay in line, do your thing and we can meditate, do yoga
Chilling on a sofa and my lofas
You’re making that bread, I play golf
I’mma stare case baby with a train, vision it
I know I’m living it with queen


I did you wrong ’cause I was fucked up lost
They caught me in the Porsche, go crying divorce
A-yo, my jury look tough, when you was sober their lost
And then you did this to me picture me cross
And you was never there when I was grinding and just flossing
And I had you in school like daddy be bossy
And now you wanna cry sober, it exhaust me
But keep the wheels right here, then jet to Georgia
I’m a chief on ‘em, no, no, noble extortion
Yeah, take it or leave it, acquire losses
She did this for capital to ball like a boss
So hold the fort down, protecting what's yours
Hey yo, no more remorse, cut endorsements
Fuck that, go back home, jet to Boston
Barking like a full grown pit’, take caution
I’m just wanting the shits, this is spot shit",https://genius.com/Raekwon-a-rainy-day-lyrics
The Brewery,Unexpected Victory,2012.0,"Still shining, keeping my toes close
Catch me on the quieter, flip something up bring your llama close
So y'all already know I have a gun team
They don't hang, phones calls one ring, dumping flames
The XKR, flyer performance
Built like gangstas hide ya bum monkey ass like warrants
Reflections is ill, my mansion out in lake shore raw
Two Mexicans two ??, a dog
Everybody angry, the benzes is meaner
Bitches is happy, casinos look cleaner
The word is chef is rocking tuxes now
His main trooper, the Haitian nigga buck this clown down
Operation money, let's mail this
Paper stepped up now his gun game is real bitch
Don't make me kill your man's other man
This ?? real handsome man said

She get him for the ransom, money in the mansion
Always stay coordinated, my shit's longer waited
Cease, I make it bubble up like it's carbonated
Double up right on the spot, you know I gotta make it
Map out all of the plots, I keep it formulated
It's still real here, I never feel fear
Make moves I wouldn't sit still in a wheelchair
Affirmed young general, street life I'm walking with stripes
I'm in the hood where they pop on site
Running through woods with wolves, only all of them bite
On reserves under the moon or under the sun
Either way, false moves put you under the gun
We ain't playing yo, revolvers is spun, we as hard as they come
Fresh out the ghetto, we the marvelous ones
Move 'em out, less talk, put the tool in his mouth
Combination to the safe, get the jewels and we out

Nigga all black wardrobe, the gat attack foes
Sajak with the flow, I turn letters to dough
Play the hood close, ten coke jars of good smoke
Hoodrats, car jackers, project kids cold
Slicker than Crisco, my bite like a pitbull
I spot 'em and pop 'em, his nickname pimples
Check what I'm into, melodies that rip you
Snub nose, turn these rottweilers into shih-tzus
Y'all life is skimmed through, mine is like a book you must get into
Every line come like a missile
I got issues, all I do is make her whistle
Let the goons figure out if your diamonds official
Let you... bullets tear your bone gristle, lung tissue
Gun in every hole of your body dog, I can't miss you
Chef Reas' and Ceaz', three to your temple
And y'all was never hot, not even near a sizzle",https://genius.com/Raekwon-the-brewery-lyrics

Enough to zoom, ten minute a wound, I comfort this
Stark confronting her, hello, miss-miss, come out the Tyra bra, miss
Marvelous, awesome bitch, out as a rich
Fly groupie bitch, crazy cum color, Penela' swiss piss
Dirty burst on her, wipe his dick on her lips
Slow the fuck down Rich, half his wrist up in the uterus
She spoke, ""I'm tellin' Louis Rich"", Max, shoot the bitch
Rollie was rooting this, Goldie hardly spoke, shit was ludicrous
She bit his dick, God wilded on her with a kick
Bobby stressed out, just like life is like a lighter
Lit a gal' on her, boo, stop wilding, for real, lighten up
For Noodles caught a lapdance, pussy clap-clap just like a tapdance
Let her fuck you on your head, go to bed

Wash knobs for free, though, only me though
Hah, polishing wax floors, she's a real whore
Keep it raw, you break law? My cousin Blake break jaws
We all raw, broke bitch, try to come aboard
Snort on the right, ho, now right as a core
I'm only fucking ya'll, cuz ya'll on, keeping my legs strong
You dead wrong, talking that shit, giving me head wrong
Sextress, dress ya ass off, bullshit necklace
Here, rock this robe, if you lose it, death wish
More head, we all getting feds, forget

I couldn't let you walk around
Thinking it's alright to let me down


I gave you all my precious love
And anything you wanted from me
You didn't hear me calling out
Calling for your warm affection after all this time
You can't deny what I'm feeling is real
And I stood around, stood by your side
Went through all the hurt and pain
And you turned and walked away

Can't give up on the way you used to give it to me
Give it to me
What a feeling it's for real

Breaking down plates and charging niggas
Prices is high, don't try to argue niggas
You might get a job from niggas

They trapped my son, them bastards is done now, they ghost
Sipping Martini cucumbers, watching the crew's numbers
I'm in Cazals, Raymond Weils, and Miguels
Spanish house of love, mi casa su casa
Two rastas with me, who the bumba...?
High tech Macs for faggot niggas
Niggas don't wear Airs no more, they wear Chanels, word sale
Outta their face if they funny niggas

Dedicated to the gun game, we toast to the best

Can't even spend it with loyal niggas, they're grimy
Even your boys will try to blind me, be strong, pa, we from the 90s

Writing poetry, click clack, my brain'll go all
Lay this new down, I copped them out in Spain
That's some new town, all W's up, come from under Wu
Suckers switch rhymes, patterns on point, flexing slick lines
Catch me in the crease of the beast, Lexus big tires
Always been a leader homeboy, niggas'll blow the beef up
Drink beef eat 'em I meant the German, she be, but try
Thousands of talents, good with nine hundred of them

If you call collect, you better say what's up with them
If you borrow the Tech, you better have a muzzle on them
If he out in despair, you better have a puzzle for them
If we buyin' some gear, you know to bring the duffel for 'em

More than petty wars and monotonous beef
I'm more than meets the eye, I'm the eye of the beast
So keep eyein' me too long and get your eyelids beat
The militia, Ice Water dynasty
Your rhymes is weak, and you don't want the line to speak
Your wine'll freeze, Get drunk and climb in sheets
About a dollar, I could go through ten dimes in a week
I got sick of chasing stars with spacious cars
Like take this, tape of ours, no tape no bars
Hoping they, take it abroad in a place so hard
That I could replace my broad and replace my job
I pray that god grant me whatever I deserve
Cause I don't want to grow to be legend of the curve

Got caught doing threesomes in the Jag
Rolling joints (?)
No points

I said cool, no more love I gotta move
I left smooth
Punched a hole in the wall and blew
I had the Call of Duty Wrangler outside
Snakeskin skin, gold madam, black Timberland, laying down why
In a stripper warehouse in Vegas
Celebrities cater
Serenading bitches, I was just fanangling
39K a night I take it
Straight with the wraith
Take it home
Nigga I fucked up with my wife

Overlooking our problems baby
Overlooking our pain
Baby lets get together
Things are not the same
We're just hurting each other over again
Two wrongs don't make it right
We find a love and then...

Aiyo, caught me by the bodega, I flossy, saucy
In viesel jeans, pockets had the measles, gleen costly
A hundred on the wrist, glist Rothstein
Glad to meet you, his boo said I eat you, just a portion of me
Leather plush, burberry sweater with the furry gloves
With the trims on, the grin on
Looking mad hungry, but my beard chunky
What's happening, you black? No question, what you offering me?
Seventeen five a banana, grab a chair
Rapping like we at the Copacabana, niggas scared
The shorty working the arms, the sister's like two big magic wands
She shook her ass in the magic thongs
She recognizing I'm no average don
She seeing me posing, extra live with my karats on
Stop, tilt the glass on 'em

The Living Room,UnKnown,2014.0,"This is Lex Diamond nigga the boss all them niggas
With the levers is soft afraid to ask what it cost
Collar made out of horse hee-haw
Skeet in your wife's mouth bopped out the restroom and beemed off
Flawless jewels is real, I got jewels in my wheel
Eyes glued to your boo in her heels
The watch is a spanker, the hands don't tick
They roll, I'm in the Rolls Wraith exercise your blinkers
You just a pussy I know, hiding behind big homeboy
So one catch the bullet I'm throwing
Sitting in Polo or Brooks Brothers
Cooling on our  how the fuck we know if your clique lovers
The story we don't know that just don't front
Or he'll blow that and I'll be like ""I told you cause I owed you""
Flexing at the Colosseum, not the one on Jamaica Ave
The one up in my lab with no demons in it
Beat Switch

You know the kid he stay fabulous car power
Catch him on tour few spartan's holding gun powder
Oops, let the Coupe in the duece, jump
Out with chains on, nope, just a check book and some boots
It's like The Musketeers of Pig Alley
I jump out, army, leather, beard like Stalley
A wise man told me to listen with vision
A General, old gold gangsters live in kitchens
Keith Hammers cocked, stay sucker free
Check me in the spot, glaciers on the thumb of my son
Take a camera shot, bumping tapes, rocking fur coats and 'gates
Window broke, base heads and capes
High power homies is real, blow a branch for ya'
Chef Cuba six bring out the tarantula
We like The Ringling Brothers posing in Nikes
Rocking big dumb knots, that's stupid spray your groupie up",https://genius.com/Raekwon-the-living-room-lyrics

I remember, all you said

Aiyo, yes sir, everything's a blessing, let the cess' splurge
Spill it in your hand, and let the s's turn
You got them wild style goons in the room, with nothing but coupes
And Pumas on, rugged beards, mean underwear
Fly in the day, high by night, money right
Solidified gangsta with his paintbrush writing
Catch me off Lenox, Spanish dip, vintage shit
Floating in the open, niggas smoking that shit, you know

Vanilla envelopes of cess, 20 bags of bless
Pissy drunk, in the project steps
Throwing dice, til the sun come out, guns come out
Trains through the 151 come out
Then it's back on the block, I'm running from the cops again
The old heads love me, asking when I'm gonna stop again
But, you know the law of the streets
How we gon' dick the freaks and what we do over beats, bitch


Yessa yessa, rap is under pressure
Had me, had 'em, hungry hoody, wearing hoods, come getcha
Four fetcha, eat tracks, Hannibal Lecter
Keep gats, Tony Jaa, still, I'm The Protector
Street speak, reach peeps, treat peeps aggressive
Smif-N-Wessun, Chef connection, nothing less than perfection
Peace number 7, God Degree's the lesson
Equality's the evanescense for my peeps in the essence

Fresh mohawk, run up in the gun store, blow off
Jump in the couple, sled range, my dame blow off
Bamboo need for the go, it's like chilly
Don't be silly, my niggas pop wheelies for dough

I tell you the first time, I ever laid hands on a pussy
Smack Earth, Wind & Fire out of jazz, pussy
That's when niggas learned to respect my army
Respect my gun and recognize me as a don

Listen, I tell no lies, spread no rumors
Have your whole family smothered, taking me for humor

Get your laugh from elsewhere, your bricks from right here
You bleed just like I bleed, so it's no fear

Aiyo, flatten niggas, what's happening, rap niggas from Staten
Gat chunky nine, bullets sitting in napkin
Ready to pop your lid off, lay low in Manhattan
Stop fronting, buttons get pressed, we jabbed 'em, tagged 'em",https://genius.com/Raekwon-i-recall-lyrics
The Lex Diamond Intro,The Lex Diamond Story,2003,"Thirty years ago there was a gangster born
He controlled the island with over 4000 soldiers
He ran over 30 projects
Whatever you needed in the hood, you had to go through him
He had his hand in everything
Racketeering, money laundering, gambling, prostitution
It was all his for the taking
He had over 400 cops on the payroll
He organized a powerful elite with a cold heart and a hot hand
And those who were perpetrators were dealt in a torturous way
The neighborhood loved and feared him
He had a good heart and a fresh soul
His name is Lex Diamond and this is his story
? with the execution of my children
From that witness forward, everybody in that courtroom knew
Uh, and agreed, that the mafia existed
The mafia operated in the United States and Sicily
It had various rules and it dominated in this business
And that many of the people in that room were members of the mafia",https://genius.com/Raekwon-the-lex-diamond-intro-lyrics

I just wanna talk to you brother, let you know man

Just a couple of bars that I wrote
I just wanted to let my presence be felt to you, you know
We love you my nigga, believe that

Yo Big what's going on good brother
Baby paw, I miss you, I wrote a dart to describe my issues
The rap game is getting too scarce
Besides in New York, the money game is getting to weird
But on another note you legend, a father with his brethren
A stepper, A Coogi sweater that's cost effected
Gangstas from the Stuy, that's you
They thought we had a beef kid, but I would never violate you
You from a part where I come from too
Just because we rhyme on a dime and had albums that blew
And that beef was a sucker beef, friendly competition
But filled with crazy love underneath
You my nigga, Yo pardon me, but I'mma be a man about it
A roll up a big fat jar of weed and smoke for your legacy Don
I shook your hand in Cali, we led by gones be by gones
This a song to a fallen hero, make no mistakes O.G
We Good Fellas, always Dinero
The movies that you made you slay'd
Rhymes was impeccable, today you are late Marvin Gaye
Every time I shine I'm thinking, we would've rocked together
One way or another we spank it
Anyway I'm just here for the love purpose
When a thug surface can't nobody judge us, fuck cursing
Casting out my love for real, youu Don'd out, gangsta'd up
Keep it real baby you the deal
Love your momma, love your seeds, this is me
Love Puff, love Kim, love Faith, love D & Cease

Stuck in my head, eat cold eggs
And fuck with the herbs

Surprising to the real niggas, peace signs
Stay out the cold when the beast shine
And East Coast hot
I know what time it is, a revolutionist
Mind made exclusive hits
Drink the best paint
Sat in the royalty line, fine the paper chase
Some sell just to get their weight up
Just be careful word to mother straight up
Heavy thoughts from this game saved up
Respect a G when I'm in your presence playa
So here's some flavor
So you can nurture on and stay on your feet
And touch the culture

And let it sink in

Footprints of Osama,The Chef Vs. The Beast,UnKnown,"This the story of Osama
Allahu akbar in Uganda
Niggas put me on to the drama
Now sit back, it's on with the data
A boy from Saudi Arabia who had it made
But he hated the... fortune, glamour, the fame, the game
An Oxford graduate, he rather see the sun when it rain
He studied economics, Islamic, drink tonic, hate chronic
Didn't hate America, he hated the Congress
Old daddy died when he was ten
These are powerful men
Who had paper, slinging oil and men
Wealthy, religious, and educated?
Ay yo this made lots of bread
Family been straight since cavemen
Three wives at 17
Now it gets better, his team
Yeah it's time to form the mujahideen
War hero legend for the Muslims, by any means
Reminds me of Farrakhan, Malcolm, and King
Play boss who had driving for show
His plans was well written
So the kid slid to Sudan
Had a couple vans some land
Few good religious brothers did all his prayers with him
Giving him grams
It was Afghanistan, he had training camp, smash
Jumping out of mid sized Toyotas with hash in 'em
Fly turbans, Suburbans, sandals on, swervin'
Jumping off of camels, eating turkey and lamb
Blood brothers, holy warriors, the others wore covers
Fuck buying jewelry, let's explore, bring the luggage
They shot to Tora Bora with no order
300 degrees out one glass a water, for four of us
Drink brother, these are them Crusaders
Who slide through the Mid East
To Hamburg, back to the border
Then some beef pop off, now it's war
A global terror in your area, U.S. calling they dogs
Bush with his regime against mujahideen
Suicide bombers vs the Marines
Al Qaeda would scheme
Nerve gas, anthrax thrown on the scene
Taliban coming martyrly",https://genius.com/Raekwon-footprints-of-osama-lyrics

Gold on me and my ho's look violent
Live bitches, five sixes, flick it up, flyin' pictures
More flips now, niggas is dipped different
Renegades, Escalades, all fly ladies in shades
Get the best of me, bless me on stage
Drop your jerseys all year round, I'm here now
Merlot in a glass, smoke a hundred bad, pop you with a pair of pounds
Toss money, no laws, pop you with a pair of pounds
Sauce money, no loss, pop you with a pair of pounds

Six hundred Benz, kid, rocked up
Up in the club, close the bar when we popped up
Got a forty cal' thirty shot Glock up
And I'm warning ya'll shit about to pop off

Hand him that, we about to take sons cabinet
Chef got it genuine style, pink verizen with the great logic
Hands is like the Ali project
Wolves of Shaolin, we look good hooded up
One tough challenge, rough 'em up, bring out his raw talents
Money maker, send them to us
Remember the symbol, the Gods got the paper, now you with us, let's go


Aiyo, speak up, we up, villains in the beat truck
Unique luck, leafed up, playin' in the suite, feet up
Come here, boo, just feel it, locked down, niggas can hear it
Blazin' in PJ's, it's time, let the ill reveal it, yo
Wall to wall jump off's, fly shorty, live sneakers and speakers
Makin' sure the vibe ain't corny, yo

Jail heads know me, Chef got it locked, my block
We got more to rag you with, black, come through, kid
Park Hill Projects, send him through, mashin' it, step
No Hollywood, yeah dear, more paper, more acres
To sell on, we all got it fresh, from raw tapes

Roaming in funeral homes, coughing niggas up when I'm ready

Yeah, the herb is the birthplace residing in the hill where we bill 'em
Still chilling we lamp right under the light gambling

So many slugs flying, thugs come in hundreds
All of them my niggas where the ? at
Female persuasion Malaysian
Most of them gulp Tabasco down, shoe game amazing
Cooling up in P.F. Changs wool
Let me see your rings, I got them on, I know the rules, cool bang

Me nah have to touch in my wrist, son me have to push to waste
And all the boy spit fire, me lick a shot to retire
So them can not move no further
I spit fire, then me call Ghostface Killah
Tell him that me just start to murder
Me spit fire, then me call Raekwon the Chef
Tell the boy run for the lawyer
Don't test this fire

Word is out, other rappers usin' their clout
Your hands ain't dipped no more, you just pissin' me off
From a jurisdiction where niggas come up missin'
Rides, get housed right
Niggas even battle for bitches
And their game is to get yours, ride through the zors
You sure? Suggest you're wise to see what time it is Lord
The plane ain't the same, the game kinda weakened your name
What you better do is spit flames

The first thing what we gotta do man
Is know what we gonna do with this +CREAM+ when we get it
I'm not tryna just be.. sitting on motherfuckin' 200 thou'
And actin' like I'm just gonna be a.. a drug dealer all my life son
I got bigger and better plans yo -> Raekwon from Striving for Perfection

Thousands to M’s,ILL Bill Is The Future Vol. II,UnKnown,"Yo, send all the workers up to five b man, you know what time it is man
Niggas did good this week man, let's celebrate

Bottles of crew, bagging in the living room, high noon
Couple rachets, snares, the razors and earmuffs
Walkie joints chirping, niggas downstairs in the lobby converting
There's something next to live wires and goons
All in the sets hundreds to thousands, thousands to ms
Then tackle up the rims store, go and buy timbs
Hit the Popeyes, cops got eyes
We breezing through with nothing but fives
Puffing herb, we gon let the sun rise
They don't know niggas is slinging, what's the lingering?
Niggas ain't fiends, $400 jeans, cooling like it's England
Rather see me role in a hole, rocking state jeans and sneakers
Square sandwhich, juices and peaches
Not right now dick, this is our valve, we get down dick
None of that clown shit, we built it from a thou
See straight watchers, my niggas sleep, all of my unique poppers
Legends from the eighties came home, we got em eating poppers
Take money, eating steaks, being rude, feeding snakes
This is what get us all the planes and the eights
This is my land like Thailand, why?
Cuz I control it and I own it, But some say it's FBI land

Now just gimme that, don't make me take that
The minute I'm finished with it, I go straight back
Re up and reload, keep up my workload
Homeboy this block is mine cuz I say so (what)

Violation of the RICO Statute to cash rules
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, the fortune of intelligent thugs
We the ones that they write movies about
Beautiful pounds, got the best doobies in town
Shoot it the fuck out, wash money, wash the blood off of Benjamin's face
Defenders of the faith, measure the weight
Forever by itself, reaping pleasure from pain
We the best in the game, hit you in the chest and the brain
I move weight homie and expand like Scarface
Leave you hanging from the chopper like Omar Suarez
Ill Bill, suicidal live ayatollah, keeps it liver than al-Qaeda soldiers
Sign in the name of Allah Jehovah
Portable wars, the blowjobs never stop
Freak bitches won't stop, sniffin' till their nose pop
Nose candy enthusiast
Bitches able to swallow an entire one liter bottle, abuser shit
We super gangsta, accurately cruising for bangers
Ya'll in the womb rappers, happily remove you with hangers
We move like a federation of terror
Put you under the dirt, cus ain't no room in this equation for error",https://genius.com/Raekwon-thousands-to-ms-lyrics
To The Top,Lost Jewlry,2013.0,"Let's take it to the top like a escalator
To touch me, you need a elevator
Black mob, my team strong, my style greater
Smooth criminal, white linen on yellow gaiters
Started with a dream to make it to a key
Now, we hoppin' outta cars that never use a key
Came out hard off credit cards and open schemes
Now, it's women who make a livin' right on their knees
All them nights, prayed a night for better days
Feelin' like Biggie in them Versace Shades
Vegas lights, sparkles bright, I got a wave
Feelin' right, bitches nice, I can't behave
Chillin' in Miami with my Cuban piece
She won't let me leave, grabbing on my Cuban linen
Pop Models, pop mollies in large dose
Pack light, pack hammers at them Award Shows

Smoke screen, cooler than them boats, sellin' choke, jump out, the whole world know us
I'm only rich, floating
Real Deal Bentley, niggas
Feel them heaters, we them Beatles
Pull out on family members, snaking leaders
Quarter-Million shit on the stove
Got some real Brooklyn killer-stack niggas with me
Spit on your globe
Got my Lawyer in the back of the foyer
Eatin' sauteéd fish, pass the goya
My gun named Toya
Marble Floors in the Benz
The rims is regular
Come through, new lots ?
Adorned with a sword in his leather
And I've been on the walls
In Ossining. And bring it back
The best and my cleaver came with me
Yo, King with me, reload quickly
I'm surely down fifty a cheeba, elloquently
I relax in the Waldorf
Under the covers, and the sword off
Sweat this shit, growing a mohawk
Ready to blow off",https://genius.com/Raekwon-to-the-top-lyrics

Fascinating in gun fights, wallabies is Chris

New Brighton hell niggas, what's happening?
Harbor where the gangsters live
Stapleton, Smooth Willie's
All of us fly high
Peace to my goon Gilley
Chef, criminals have to eat ferocious
Six wheels, Maybach black, blowing on roaches
The empire is built from the ground up
I come around, what?
You get nothin' now
Stand there all frowned up
The emperor especially in buildings
Got a temper
No money coming slapping
Something down, it's suspenders
Now back to my shorty at hand
How you want it?
What's the plan?
Just be cool
Converse with your man

So many things I'm going through
So much that I wanna do
It's starting to become so clear to me
Tomorrow ain't really guaranteed
So many days I've thought of you
It's about time you knew the truth
Got to act quickly you and I
We fall in love
So many reasons why

Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we?
Why don't we fall in love?

Why don't we fall in love?
It's so many reasons

It takes such a load off to let you know
That you're the only one
I never want to go
Things I never did
Now I want to do
And love I never felt
Now I feel for you
Why?
I want to just swallow
Each and every ounce of my pride
Everything you do
I wanna feel again

She was a crooked one, yeah thats my nigga

They're known to sweet beef then break out  lay low in the Aspens

Are we really sure
Can a love that lasted for so long still endure?
Do I, really care? Hey, hey
Let's talk about the distractions goin' on elsewhere

I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
Why? I keep hearin' footsteps baby
In the dark, in the dark
My mind drifts now and then
Lookin' down dark corridors and wonders what might have been
Something's up ahead
Hey, should I keep this same direction or go back instead?

Honey, now lets stop walkin' around
When there's love lost to be found
And you know I still care, I still care
What's the sense in goin' elsewhere?
Who feels really sure?
Can that feelin' guarantee your happiness shall endure?
And do we, really care? Hey, hey

Federal bureau with ikes, did it all our lives
We Swiss bankers, cream making in Australia
Floss whales, we live, men, plus the son of the Mahalias
Gold plated horse with the wooden face, catch me up grace
Iceberg blanket, Queen Cheeba sheets
The Giganti's, paparazzi nazi, elbow money
Invisible glaciers, laying over rastas
Let the stars know, the crescent is the blessing
We came here to show and prove, make moves, for every dollar in the groove
Rhymes that's imported, wore platinum kitchens and shit
Niggas gave bitches, most got extorted

Yo, aqua swiss iceberg wrist, the chocolate swiss miss
Love the Spanish kid, with the Starburst twist
Marvelous, with the '59, 50 fitteds, matching the kicks
That's crispier than Saint Nicolas fish
Do take, niggas slipping the disk, Wop and Rae world premiere shit
Like Sermon and Smith, homey, my sermom is swift
I got them powerful verse, that if
This was a church, the'll give a cripple person a lift
And now he crip walking, I ain't just talking
I do this thing often, ask Kenyon Martin
Last week, I gave his chain a bone
And told him, take this with you to Boston (the kid's awesome)

From every borough to borough, every castle to castle
We connect, put it down, and we ask you
Real niggas rapidly past you, mumbling, come on
Standing right in front of the building, son, nigga, you might die

Yo, I came across the Verrazano, to polly with Mr. Polly, himself
Plus I need a pair of wally's with the cheddar melt
Goat snake skin to coincide with the belt
It's doe or die, baby, like Sosa, hold your penny up high

Aiyo, inkless colorless Aston, toast, nigga, post
One of the finest made taylors to sow
My medicine's growth, young popes, greatest of all time
Spoke, who drove off, had sixty horses on post
It's automatic magic, thirty kangols
Understand, fabric spray at faggots, close
The legacy's dying, fakers approach, hit him with the hater soap
Clap at your gators and snatch your hoe

It's the 2 double 0 3, version of the Cold Crush
And Force MC's, I'm bout to force mc's
To get their weight up, yo Rae, I'm a DJ, and I'm still telling
Rap cats, to step they game up, ain't that some shit, playa?

Paid niggas don't talk, just straight to the bar
Buy the whole shit out, then light up a bark
Colorful kings, wardrobes is different from yours
You don't want no beef, better take it to Moe's
Put the drink on the side and say what
My mans with the turban on, mouth froze

One more hand gon ride tonight

Fuck it, catch him by the crib

For a buck, she would guzzle your kids
And let you kick a tall-boy Heineken up in the shit
This wack-ass nigga fronting, yap about bids
Behind the walls, niggas pissed on him, gave him the biz
Just a tough guy fronting cause he famous and shit
Back in '89, baby crimes, rape and some shit

He's so grand, Had plans to go legit but couldn't quit
Misfit mentalities lead to death young, Hold your tongue
Don't get strung and fall victim to the street life
For real it's real, Still we blast steel
Write your will cause we will, Kill at will when it's real
Cream Team is the sun's equation, In this nation of free-basin
Crimes we be lacin, Keys get cut like Jason
Lifes we erasin, He got a lead donation at Jay Street train station
In the theater, I saw the drama go on
They actin like it can't happen, I yapped em did you clap em
That's confidential information, I move like Perry Mason
Inside Pappy Mason, Raekwon gave me education
He said it's one nation, Power in his bitch station
Queens was mine like, Fiends was mine
And we ain't pussy, Murder seeds we hot
Never divid, Even if our dreams collide, Yall on the other side

Thermometers hot, Shit boilin
The cast of Troy, Gun on my lap boy, Black boys shoot moist
Python linger from the Nike armor
The Prince Charmer, Select big armor now it's horror
Multi, Say it again, We regulate and take your pies

Dirty work technique, Smoother the crime out like jerk meat
Merkin in the burnt three, He hurt me

There go Meryl Lynch mits, Brownsville bitch

With the boots on, police on us for real
And I love it, my guns is rugged, bulletproof vans with plans
To stay gangstered up and scramble
With the rest of the stresses, the tests
My bank HSBC, yeah, feel all my blessings
While wild out, I'm mild out, calm and humble
Blow a hole in your soldier, come through
Beyond that, guns for combat, right in front of the lobby
My hobby just too ill to saw black
He ain't the shit, we ain't the shit
But we will squeeze for them keys, point black and spank ya shit
Always in Nike, pen filled gooses, leather knockouts on, Tropican' juices
One false move I'm pressing niggas, automatic buttons on 4/5ths

Legacy, you're the don, legacy, you're the king
Stories of the hood, lights, the fame bring
We runs the past, the strong survive
For perfection we strive, the legends alive

Yeah, what up, Rae? Yeah, living legend
They say nothing worth having comes easily
Let's go get in, buzz it down and spread it out evenly
Camouflage my rides, blend with the scenery
And bang in the face of my enemy
Divine from the waist ain't no killing me, it runs in my family
Bloodline, prepare for the best, through tough times
Fifty car caravan, anything jumping
Got the wheel real big with the rims still rubbing
But my rims ain't touching, I'm a Defcon button
I'm a Russian made Kalashnikov, motherfucker
The same thing that builds you up, ain't reserve notes
Watermarks stacked, In God We Trust
But any man can and will be crushed, heaviest move like elephant tusk
Think you better adjust the way you approach, don't get too close
Because you might get hit with a shitbag, and a wheelchair dented in zig-zag

Legacy, you're the don, legacy, you're the king
Stories of the hood, lights, the fame bring
We runs the past, the strong survive
For perfection we strive, the legends alive

Huh, Murs, yo
Now when I first started out, they said I wouldn't make it
I'm made of less metal, probably just couldn't take it
I roll with my aces, certified assassins
Mid-city militia, we come through smashing
We fucking with them butterknives, we swinging them katanas
Sharper than piranhas, cutting through your body armor
It's all about honor, man, respect the code
Touch a point on your neck and make your chest explode
And the water turns vets into vegetables
You gotta, stay on point or be the next to go
Whether, dickies or chucks, or the guess and low

Skated with six hundred and cash, he did the dummy
We splashed 'em, then boat it in a CLS glass, we vicious


Come one, I see my cash is getting low
And if I can't shake no dough, what the fuck am I living for
It's easy for my heater, just to let these niggas know

In this rap, fire my ratchet, I'm shutting this rap
Caddy steel, face the back, or blown the fuck off from rap
Reach across and blow this shit out your boss in the back
Survived in a porsche, I rap, at a buck 80 verse
Or verse, daddy, let's do it for change
I'm forty eight hundred grams, one chain, the trend, a new range
Or any project bench, with all my shit on
Flashy don, Gucci on uptowns
Fucking up classics, gay baskets, D.H. niggas
Won't snitch for shit, criminals that spit
Oh shit, I forgot all about you man, twenty and change

Swinging remorsely, guns I'm waving 'em

Kill them lines, we living in them airs with wears
You heard of us, the most powerful glastrinomical
I'm used to big shit, light hitting off the big tower, boo

Foul, live like a Lion
Listen to the streets and your gun go off
Sorta like a show off
Jungle way of livin', hittin' dro off
Lifestyle changes niggas see that
They gettin' anxious just to throw one in your ski hat
Watch your language, yeah, you fresher than a Million bucks
You got a new hustle, you hardly knew niggas would envy lust
They gettin' hungrier and niggas bust
They lit a bigger dutch
Fixin' them Calicos to dig your guts
Detectives roam
Niggas come home and got a bigger dome
Ready to zone on what a nigga own
Caught in the mischief
How can you live when it's a sickness
That sorrounds that projects and the trenches
Walkin' through the bushes at night
You gotta be sharp like a butcher knife
Subtly show up when the jooks is right
And everything will have a major like
Whether it's black or white
Nobody knows until they snatch your life
Wake up son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up!

Blowin' each cartridge
We ill, realer in each market
Feel the leather jacket, sleek ostrich
Unleash the arsonist, just popped the wig off of each hostage
Make it real and make his niece watch it
Yokin' Grandmothers up, we kill until his peeps squash it
Verse is somethin' mean regardless
A green jar of harvest
Just smoke, niggas got the green Garcia's
A terrifying team of heartless
Move on the Narcs's
We only on it for extreme profits
And anyway we dream darkness
I saw it through the Jean Paul Gotier mint green gleam optics
So wake up Son, the season's just a thing the mind make up
It's only real kid, ha, wake up
Chorus 2x
Verse 3:
A message from Elijah's kids
My eyes opened, got wise on the biz
Start risin' my wig
Seen everything I saw before
Had dreams behind a wall
All I wanted was to balance my all
Make it through feedin' my kind
Readin' the lines
On how the dollar bill is shaped and designed
Taught from the Eighties
Talk, build, and protect all Babies
Strong shelters with strong Ladies
A nigga died, died amongst Daisies
He did it for the Babies
Thats peace, feed 'em if they gettin' lazy

Can’t see nothing I wear, fronting out here
They ask me how I’m eating, I be hunting out here, yeah

So many rings plus surrounded by kings
Sitting back in the fourth row, examining Queens
They like “Chef, yo, you built for it meet at the Biltmore”
Any violations I agree to get killed for it
Where’s the real rap? Niggas is lost now
Hmm, how much it cost now to marry it up?
Divorce it, blaow, extortion style
Shoot the first nigga who talk, you lost your style
My next album might be called The Wild
Wolverines, bears and whales, no snails
Foxes, good Great Danes, that’s all, he Cale
Kill all the rats, for real
They live in the hoods
They all come out convinced to sell
Little clothes niggas is frail
‘Cause when he rap it’s like poisonous lines that’s rich
Mix together virgin blood and gallons of piss, yo
The real lowdown in the midst
I come like Sandy in the middle of the year like Christmas

Twenty four hour funny, long as it's no money

To every nationality and black seeds, I stand

Hundred that'll rock for me, still kill you, over your men bitch
Skiing in Alaska, half the man, half Casper
Runnin' with wolves, the bulls look nastier
Silencer, each is thee least, will kill on Easter

Can't believe you the most slept on
Took a break since the Cuban, niggas lookin' like you just repped wrong
You done slimmed down a bit, got caught with the hammer
Steal banners, medical examiners, clocked live hammers
For real, you a live nigga, rock ya five in ya slippers
Like them other five guys in ya picture
Come on, watch, I'm the star of the show, so blow then
Mothafucka, you ain't blew in three years
You son of a bitch, that's why I rock the big shit
Don't forget who you is, nigga, you my little shit
I will crush you to pieces, stop ya heart from tickin'
And you mad 'cause you a older clock, couple rocks missin'
And my Breitling--the band: you can say it's iced lightning
You don't like him, do you? You wanna fight him
In fact, I should've put you back, relaxed on the stones
And copped the two-thousand leather in snow cones
A bowl of milk almost killed you, ak, you almost drowned in Pops
I bought another box, I'ma keep it real with you
And I'ma murder you if ya bitch-ass get on my nerves again

Yo, Ghost, you'se a funny nigga
Turn on the radio, all you hear is X and Jigga
Ha ha, you vexed, nigga?
No airplay

Bet my gat spray

And up North, nigga, you ain't gettin' jailplay

Hold on, let me park my shit
Let me find out this nigga barkin' and shit I'm a Don of this shit
And you know that shit I wrote with Golden Arms is a hit
My Wallos show off, go off like an alarm in the six
Draped in yellow and I'm still poppin'

Beat trial with illegal aide, fuck Cochrane
And if it's on I might blow you if I'm boxed in.. {*echoes*}

And a half a cup of brandy
And throw in a bag or two of sugar
And just a pinch of vanilla
Grease up the cookie sheet

Then preheat the oven to three-fifty
And give that spoon a lick
Say everybody have you seen my balls

If you ever need a quick pick-me-up
Just stick my balls in your mouth
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
Put 'em in your mouth and suck 'em
Suck on my chocolate salty balls
They're packed full of goodness, high in fiber
Suck on my balls

What's that smell?
Smell like somethin' burnin'
Well, that don't bother me none

Became friends with baking soda, Arm & Hammer craziness
Started learning cooking up, cooking up, cooking up
Nose feeling like it's high, door open windows up
Out of state money was coming great, we sold weight
Another scramble, Commonwealth law gamble
We out touring, leave the hood now the hood boring
Niggas still doubting my greatness, my great shift

Four shottys, Two lasers a plate, Chewing
Start a movement, Keep doing what your doing
Niggas are straight, We like Shar Pei in prestigious face
Love diamond rings and apes, Big money, Coffees and tapes
Play'n, You get sprayed in the lake
Hog tied and scraped, Chop fingers off you and skate

Live through the babies, Busting my gun for sure

Fresh sneakers, Stressing for ass
Write mad letters in slabs, Niggas'll be home shortly

That's what I like, that's what I like

Raised fly while we in the midst of getting high
Take a walk through memory lane, watching when all the pain fly
Things that, happen in relationships, dealing with weapon
And men be on the same bullshit
Let's travel, take a walk with me, yo
I'm like the whiskers that be blazing in your transister
Relax, spoil me, I be on the tour shortly
With enough to spread fortune out, lord, you caught me
We analitical thinkers, we crow too with top rankers
Big thick juicy rocks on the finger
Chill, all my niggas who keep it real
Throw your baseball hat down and keep paying your bills


A wiseman spoke on my behalf, til then I enquired the math
Rae exist with God in the half
Lessons, a mouth full of food, sit back
I tell a story for the blocks and the power moves
Shorties claiming that they hustle for a cause, get caught
In the sharp blade of a knife, but older niggas's go
But some shine, that's the best part of they flaws
They need cover, because we trapped inside these Winter Warz
I come to ya'll as Elijah, stars on the crown symbolizes
Planets for a new horizon
It's all peace when you sizing, the next man enterprising
Learn how to move, don't disguise it
The bulk of the brick will be shown, you all alone
All you think about is getting you fly, that's getting you torn
The evil that maps out of my vulture, murder raps'll sculp you
Hip hop selected our culture
One nigga word ain't enough, let's get up and exercise
The mind like a sit up, walk with your chin up
Post that stormy winter, animos'll tear a friend up
Principals make a nigga light dimmer


It's like Babylon, my society, so wild, been a variety
Which make me seek prosperity
Brothers and sisters let's connect, show love and respect
The youngings is watching, put 'em in check, yo
Your life could change in a sec, ambitions, you bet
Today your here, tomorrow, leaving out the projects
Wake up, we all got morals, striving for perfection
It's just a lesson to look forward to, yo",https://genius.com/Raekwon-my-life-lyrics
Lex Diamond Story Outro,The Lex Diamond Story,2003.0,"Some still say Lex is a powerful man
He is still one of the most influential gangsters of all time

Who said gangsters couldn't be governors
And governors couldn't be gangsters
I know he's still around and we all have a little Lex in us
But until then, he will always be, the official Lex Diamond

I got niggas'll that ride, and if the cops pull up
Just splash the drain and run, we just blow stuff

I'mma bang, them 10 sharp pointy things through your coconut
We dodge prison, got lawyers for that
Holdings knots up through riddle shit, you know it's a rap
Need I remind you, so many killas on my line, too
We can form an army, get money and rhymes
That's the breaks when it come to just getting papes
No remorse, violate, we just take up the source
I'm the Montana, with long hammers, the strong arm of the city
It's just promotion on cameras


Yo, we been the life of killas, ever since we was born
First got on, we blast on gorillas
Been taught from babies to bust three eighties, the skies just blaze
Then come back, with your head in a jar
My peoples is the most important part, yeah, take us apart
Annihilate, fiends scrapping, we hating these czars
Lions in the mountains, wolves in the hood
With four pounders, how dare you lounge in the park
It's ill how we setting standards, to let them cannoms slam you
It's all strictly, pardon your art
Yeah, the general's path to blow, I'm up laughing
You fucked up, send 'em back, this the city of God

Bloodhounds who play the building, buildin', brick at a time
Trying to turn my little dime into a million

Formulate a plan, don't even plot, just get a nigga
But see, we knew a crew of dudes, who hustled a lot, we broke
The opportunities and set up drug deals in the parking lot
Stacking cuz it's necessary, notice how the world go round

You wrong, where's the evidence, watch the firearm
Where a tunnel of fans stand, I knew I had little bits of love

Suade fronts, Balley's and blunts
Living amongst thieves, all we did was robbin', we won, Marvin

Hey baby, what you no good? (That's right lord)
And trusted and back with, it's me I want

War is hell (War is hell, and get real with life)
And will it be (start teachin' ya'll brothers, man)
When will people start gettin' together again",https://genius.com/Raekwon-whats-goin-on-lyrics
Ever Since I Was 13,"The Vatican Mixtape, Vol. 4",2010.0,"Ever since I was 13, my biggest problem has been just to find the right road to get to that rainbow that everybody talks about
Like most people get close enough to count the stripes
But they don't have enough guts to reach out and take that pot of gold
What up my dude, you know
Going through a lot and all that man
That's why you be strong, you know what I'm saying
Feel great boy (Staten Island over yeah)
It's going now ()
Holla at the kid
(Let's go chef)

I'm flawless, the gowns that I rock is cashmere
Then roam through the lab with the hammer and black Airs
Thinking 'bout plans that's real, laying the bill
Drop a new classic album, my masters will
Enlighten your mind, I'm writing on times
When the youth reach real situations and they thoughts are blind
You know when I float a moment is fine, glass of wine
New elegance, the greeze just pass through the mind again
What happened, rap made it happen, back when
Two turn tables and a needle, action
We all huddled up, that's it, classic shit
Only our kind adapt to shit
Start rapping 'bout cracks and Pimps, cash to get
Call it C.R.E.A.M. now, no grind don't ask for shit
We bastard thick, pass the spliff

Name of this piece is called ""my bitch better have my money"" (applause)
My bitch better have my money, through rain, sleet or snow
My ho better have my money
Not half, not some, but all my chash
Because if she don't, I'mma put my foot in her ass",https://genius.com/Raekwon-ever-since-i-was-13-lyrics

Flush Verse,"The Vatican Mixtape, Vol. 4",2008.0,"Selling glass and blasting, machinery sling past
Next stop: Bowling Green, bling flashing
Glow my ass off, Po-Po they try to harass
My dough - ching cash - and I sit in my dash and vent
You know the W that come from Dirty Bast
Bird baths, love to stunt, we got birds with gats
Fly past, buy NASA, caught up with the cash
Why blast when you know we in your crib? Bypass
I mastered what? The treasurer of getting ass
Whip assing, red pipe and leather; slick nasty
Sassy, but at the same time raspy
Plug me a thug, your mother eating plaster",https://genius.com/Raekwon-flush-verse-lyrics
Pioneers,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Fly as the new Five
Live as a white man with black skin
Powerful grimeys, who eat raw like Chinese
Petty cases of coke, boat loads of good ol' dough
We carry back to Medina from Beringia
Feed me a Spanish, half-black, massive back
Thick in the legs, bank account stacked
A nigga with a liable piece of gold
A ranch made of brick white picket fence
Vision my dick
Six horses, four Shar Peis, crib like Holyfield
Build mine slowly, grow G
And a lesson building in manifestin'
Keep the stress off your chest
Then get money like Mexicans
Live as a corner with hard rocks
And big nines and dimes, I'm only part 2
And you a dart
Distinguished gentlemen who love getting dick sucks
Hate comical rap, but kill men for 10 bucks
The palm lady spit on my grave and said, ""Chef, you stay paid""
One shell hit you I fell with you
And till then, blow forever
Keep family snakes away -
You got a daughter to treasure
Have twins name one Caesar, female called Anisha
We out to Fiji on Easter
Good bottle of wine
Nine on me dwelling on time
Wearing bally sneaker watch Phillip Stein
Mad grey in my waves, 101-EX
Exelero behind me, dumbstruck meat heads
Thinking of the days I got robbed, not for money
When I mean albums, they couldn't catch it I fouled them
But now more aggressive, checks look special too
Do the knowledge, young boy, we professional",https://genius.com/Raekwon-pioneers-lyrics
On the Fly Note,Blood on Chef’s Apron,2009,"Maxing on a fly note, real nigga's appear
We honor those gangstas who ain't here
Legends was born, Apollo classics, young niggas with ones
The hype ratchets, New Balance and Bill Blassie
Roof top nights, the booth, coked down
Air Force on since twenty two
Live niggas try to rhyme, but died
Off the strength of the name, on wack cocaine, niggas is high
Let the beat journey, we could all see clearly
Tweak through the earlobe, with peak of this shit, we seen years go
High times rhyming, so divine, lines that taste like spring water
Shorty dope like a nine
Poison shot the lungs of young
Went through the barrel of sparrow, one who ain't hawk through the slum
Bums had no where, train style, one chain out
Mission was dust, a foam blew my brains out

Who would've thought it was me?
Who would've thought it was you?
Just vibe, just watch you ride it, ride it",https://genius.com/Raekwon-on-the-fly-note-lyrics

You don't come here
No, no
You go to England
That's wherever the fuck they make it
If you want champagne
You go see the French
If you need money
You find a Jew

If you want dirt
Or scum buried under a rock somewhere
Or some secret nobody wants anybody to know about

So that I know I won't get hooked
Not on no coke, you can't get hooked
My friends have been snorting 15 years, they ain't hooked

From the tone of the voice, it's moist and choice
A special, he shoot 'em in the face with them boy
Yo, from all them niggas off of Hoy Street, came this
Large nigga taking over parole
Crib all stretched out, bulletproof saunas
Furry minks, touching the ground, she slaughtered six shrinks
One of the primetime kings, all of the young niggas
Who lived it, will sit in the box and dream
He coppin' lots of things, he even got rasta connects
Now, he bling, if lord love me, he'll throw it up, all lovely
Open the shirt, all ugly
He kept the Purple Tape, hug me
Tell that nigga Chef, when that nigga get on, plug me
There it go, Barnaby Jones and Mugsy

Let's go (Yeah, nigga)
Good lookin' Rae that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
(It's all good don't worry about it)
You feel what I'm sayin'? (Don't worry about it)
Yeah (Word up, let's go)
You know how we gotta come at this niggas, man
Yeah.. come on.. yo

Stuck, y'all like gum underneath my kicks
Better move little fucks when the heat I'll spit
The hammer clap like the ass on a meat-out chick
Dump clips like a trifflin' ass bitch to drop
If you short you're a chance in the box
But I ain't lettin' you play with the guns in the club, I'm boothin' the ox
Got my eyes on the ho's and I'm a peripheral
Got you cowards poppin' that Moe', my hand on the 'istol
Wild out, have a ball, you could drink 'til you 'url
Thought the Firewater was strong, the pound'll leave you curled
On the floor, like a new born baby, God
What you mean ""Is he dead?"", what type of shit is leakin' out of his head?
When you cowards see the drama and it come to a head
I'm hittin' Rae up on the jacket, it ain't much to be said
If it's on, go without sayin' somethin', deliverin'
Visa verca, this is Havoc, baby, we those niggas (we those niggas)

All that money is us, now what's fuckin' wit' us?
Eh yo all around hungry, that's us and can't get nothin' get it
Eh yo all that money, all them niggas
All them shorties, everybody yell ""All lovely""

I chop meat out ya face, Daddy, gladly
Mad breeze on, rubberband currency and I splash ya visa
You know the code, yo caesar low straddlers
Front Streets, cracks all in the front seat spazzin'
Imperial wizards, Staten
Knife game off the chain and I'm with four hundred with wagons yo
Live wires, shoot darts for bread
Any map, I assist that, I'm holdin' it, all niggas dead
What? Battle for cake and fuck wizzes
We do it straight business, all mount ride, ain't no fake niggas
Reminisce, spit faces
Pissin' on the fake little swindler's list, Rae gave them niggas cake
Battle the gun, you're wildin'
I might levitatate well, I might take ya shit, push up, stylin' it
Oxes, reefers, police need us
The regime of Shaolin with Queens re-up
Fuckin' with the poisonous hand
Remember y'all, no commercial, I hurt you, yo go get ya mans


Eh yo select me, Gucci sneaker recipe
Not the S dot Carters, no disrespect but respect me
One of the top five gangstas alive
My element is just the Elliott Ness, niggas who hide
Yo I ran from some niggas that was police
These niggas heard about me bringin' marked money in, I had the whole East
I've been the greatest, been flippin' the latest
Somethin' like the new haggler on the Ave., ham it up, pullin' haze
And all the young niggas praise me
It's like the talent of the Six Million Dollar Man, 'yana pace
Come on, banana squeeze, aim at these Caravans
Heard he had his man and that ugly Keish'

Yeah, fuck them niggas, homey

For years, he had the coast's on lock
Jamaicans make bread, Cubans call him pop
Was a young O.G., considerate, fly gangsta anxious
His face is rude, that made him more dangerous
Went suddenly blind, he couldn't see faces
He rock glaciers, well known in strange places
Been killin' niggas, all ages
Paid his way up out of court cases, extortin mazes
Love stay greens, livin' in Queens
Cousin named Dahoom, who you, nigga I'm Team
Dressed real ill proper, when he locked up
Playin' the wall, one foot up, what, the kid was into soccer
Love family, nigga in Miami, right, Air Force's on
Four horses smokin' on china white, they bad
He had the Shaft look, and then he yell Rae
He had cribs hooked, he had nasty books
Him and his right hand, worth a hundred in the can
Little short Dominican, little Duran was fam
Eyes bloody, pop Vasine and he studied
Gave rides to me, dropped me and Old Earth in Brooklyn
I mean Brook-lan, a super crook don off the hook
He had the juks look, and he loves Benzes and gongs
Get wands, daddy, Yukon, grow up get on's daddy
Be sure, watch for, eat all that, daddy
Yeah, young'n's, supposed to marry
Don't play me close, kept the loot in his boats, he threw the toast at me
I wanted to be with him badly
Had me like a little nigga, runnin' with wolves, they all glow gladly
Heavenly, now he seventy, got rich representin' me
He won't throw me no cash, play pool, baby
I be like, ooh, no you didn't, baby, get drunk money
You'se a slick dude, baby, slip through, baby
Yeah, I'm on, makin' records now, I be gettin' money after you gone
He's a Don, slick Juan, Marijuan', Don Juan
Eatin' Caribbean food, feedin' me wrong
Breathe from the tongue, Chef you live
Make these niggas realize you gon' be number one

We in the night up from sunset to dawn, light it up
See the mutts’ first breakout, pardon my nuts, and grab it
Where your boss at, faggot?
Switching lanes, tidier chains, listening to the things you saying
With no money, motherfucker—not a dime

It’s all about intelligent lines (Be yourself, nigga)

Playing Lionel and Diana, talking on the phone to a whore
“Bring the baggies, take the thousand to Nana”
While I’m in the zone, cat daddy, indica home
Blowing Earth weed, pardon me, Perth weed
Looking good, smelling like Indonesia (Yes)
Hair full of waves in the caves of Pisa
Chilling singing that “Mona Lisa”
Gold teeth in my mouth, handful of rings, the thiefster
All I know is “Rob ‘em, wing ‘em”
Under the building, blinging, 24 hours of slanging
Caking off G and staking off
Me and some goons from different parts of the Mediterr-ean
They thought all my brothers were Korean
Japan know me well, stop, that’s the Chef riding a BM
