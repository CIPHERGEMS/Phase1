Doo Wop (That Thing),The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"Yo, remember back on the Bully
When cats used to harmonize like
Yo, yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen
Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)
(Put them up, put them up)

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again
(A win win, come again
A win win, come again)

Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?
Come again, come again
Come again, come again

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out
Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls, you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys, you know you'd better watch out
'Cause girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

Hey, we’ve got some very intelligent women here, man
Do you think you’re too young to really love somebody?
(No! No, no, I don’t think so)
I say it for me, uh, I’m an adult I say, wait
“You’re too young to be in love, this is silly
You’re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas”, I mean, it might be something I don’t know
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)
Well, you tell me. What’s the difference?
(Okay, You can love anybody but when you’re in love with somebody you’re looking at it like this: You’re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)
(You’re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)
(You might stop being in love but you are not gonna stop loving that person)
(Maybe they ain’t never been loved before or been in love before, they don’t know what the feeling is to be loved)

To Zion,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"One day, I'm gonna understand...
Zion

Unsure of what the balance held
I touched my belly overwhelmed
By what I had been chosen to perform
But then an angel came one day
Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man-child would be born
Woe this crazy circumstance
I knew his life deserved a chance
But everybody told me to be smart
""Look at your career,"" they said
""Lauryn, baby use your head""
But instead I chose to use my heart

Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, Zion!)
Now the joy of my world
Is in Zion! (Zion, uhh, Zion!)

How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come
See life for you, my prince has just begun
And I thank you for choosing me
To come through unto life to be
A beautiful reflection of His grace
See I know that a gift so great
Is only one God could create
And I'm reminded every time I see your face

That the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion)
Now the joy (Joy)
Of my world (World)
Is in Zion (Is in Zion, is in Zion)

Okay, how many people here have ever been in love? I know none of the guys are gonna raise their hand. How many of y'all ever been in love?

(Mumbling)

I know none of the guys been in... we don't get in love, right? Oh! Let this black man right here tell what his idea of love is, 'cause not all the time we hear a young black man talk about love. 
About your personal definition, don't tell me what Webster thinks. Huh?

Willingness to do everything for that person

Okay, everything like what? Explain. Let him talk c'mon. If I asked him to talk about a fancy car, he'd be right on point. But we wanna talk about love. You can do it. (To another pupil) What do you think? You said you love somebody, you should know why you love them right?

The way they act

Uh-huh

The way they carry themselves, stuff like that

Okay

The way that they hang with they boys, and they just stand out. It's like sometimes it don't even matter like what they wear or what they look like. It's like, that way, you know?

Yeah

It's like you know you want to talk to him, because he stands out, it's like he got a glow or something

That's deep

That's what I'm talking about

I thought that was a beautiful point. Anyone else want to deal with that?

It's sometimes, like when they try to act funny in front of they boys, like when they get around say they love you. They can't love you. 'Cause love-love-love wouldn't do that

Love is not phony!

Lost Ones,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"It's funny how money change a situation
Miscommunication lead to complication
My emancipation don't fit your equation
I was on the humble, you on every station
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb
But remember not a game new under the sun
Everything you did has already been done
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun
Can't take a threat to mi new born son
L been this way since creation
A groupie call, you fall from temptation
Now you wanna bawl over separation
Tarnish my image in your conversation
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

Now, now, how come your talk turn cold?
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold
Wisdom is better than silver and gold
I was hopeless, now I'm on hope road
Every man wanna act like he's exempt
Need to get down on his knees and repent
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment
Your movement's similar to a serpent
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?
Consequence is no coincidence
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent
Always want to take it to the full out extent
Always want to make it seem like good intent
Never want to face it when it time for punishment
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion
There come many paths and you must choose one
And if you don't change then the rain soon come
See you might win some, but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly how come?
You just lost one

Now don't you understand, man, universal law?
What you throw out comes back to you, star
Never underestimate those who you scar
'Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard
You can't hold God's people back that long
The chain of Shatan wasn't made that strong
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn
Now, some might listen and some might shun
And some may think that they've reached perfection
If you look closely you'll see what you've become
'Cause you might win some but you just lost one

You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one
You might win some but you just lost one

You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly how come?
You might win some, but you really lost one
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?
When it's all done, did you really gain from
What you done done? It's so silly how come?
You just lost one
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one, you just lost one
(How come, you lost one? It's so dumb)
You just lost one, you just lost one
You just lost one
What a bam-bam!... hehehe

Develop a negative into a positive picture

To make a better situation (better situation)
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow
All we need is dedication

To finally be in love, and know the real meaning of
A lasting relationship, not based on ownership
I trust every part of You, 'cause all that I...
All that you say you do
You love me despite myself, sometimes I fight myself
I just can't believe that you, would have anything to do
With someone so insecure, someone so immature
Oh, you inspire me, to be the higher me

You make my desire pure, you make my desire pure
Just tell me what to say, I can't find the words to say
Please don't be mad with me, I have no identity
All that I've known is gone, all I was building on
I wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you

Touch my mouth with your hands
Touch my mouth with your hands
Oh I wanna understand, the meaning of your embrace
I know now I have to face the temptations of my past
Please don't let me disgrace, will my devotion last?
Now that I know the truth, now that it's no excuse

Keeping me from your love, what was I thinking of?
Holding me from your love, what was I thinking of?
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind
You are my peace of mind, that old me is left behind

He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible
He says it's improbable, but I know it's tangible
He says it's not grab-able, but I know it's have-able

'Cause anything's possible, oh anything is possible
Please come free my mind, please come meet my mind
Can you see my mind? Oh
Won't you come free my mind?
Oh, I know it's possible
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything, yeah

You're my peace of mind, you're my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind
He's my peace of mind, he's my peace of mind

To get another chance, yeah
Everyday's another chance

The Mystery of Iniquity,MTV Unplugged 2.0,2002.0,"It's the mystery of iniquity...
Said it's the misery of Inequity...
Said it's the history of Inequity...

All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down

Children...
Eat your bread
Little children...
Eat your bread
Cause it all...
All falls down...
Telling you all...
It all falls down

Yo! Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies
Perjures the jurors, witness despised
Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized
It's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas
Enter the Dragon, black-robe crooked-balance
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous
Publicly perpetrating that ""In God We Trust""
Cross-examined by a master manipulator
The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers
See the bailiff representing security
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury
The prosecution, political prostitution
The more money you pay, the further away solution
Legal actors, Babylon's benefactors
Masquerading as the agency for the clients
Hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant
Orally armed to do bodily harm
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm
And the defense isn't making any sense
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence
That a defendant is depending on the system
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist em'
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen
Framed by intentions
Inventions whereby they lynch men
Enter the false witness slandering the accused
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected
Expert witness (the paid authority)
Made a priority to deceive the majority
Of disinterested peers, dodging duty for years
Hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers
Do we expect the system made for the elect
To possibly judge correct? 
Properly serve and protect?
Materially corrupt, spiritually amuck
Oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt
Blind leading the blind, guilty never defined
Filthy as swine, a generation purin it's own mind
Legal extortion, blown out of proportion
In vein deceit, the truth is obsolete
Only two positions: victimizer or victim
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma
Trying to own a piece of the ""American Corona""
The Revolving Door, insanity every floor
Skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for?
Empty traditions, reaching social positions
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief
The standard is Thief; brethren, can we candidly speak?
Woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'
Leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom
Confusion consumes them
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white
Internally they absent of light
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night
Under the curse
, evil men waxing more worse
Faxing the first, 
angelic being cast to the earth
It's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit
Turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal
Oh it's real, surrender for Jehovah is real
How long will you sleep, troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep
The idols YOU heap, causing the destruction you reap
Judgment has come, find it and return to the One
Abandon the flesh
, 
self-interest: Broadway to death
Pride and the Greed
, 
hide and subdividing the seed
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie
Caused us to die
, let your emotions be crucified
Renounce all your thoughts
Repent and let your mind be re-taught
You'll find what you sought
Was based on the deception you bought
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught
Loving a lie
, 
not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die

I Used to Love Him,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him

I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

Forgive Them Father,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us
Although them again we will never, never, never trust
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Them nuh know what them do
Dig out your eye, while I'm sticking like glue
Fling, skin, grin, while them plotting for you, true!

Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Me a tell you, dem nuh know)
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Fi be real, them nuh have a clue!)

Beware the false motives of others
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you
To you
They say all the right things, to gain their position
Then use your kindness as their ammunition
To shoot you down in the name of amibition, they do
Ohhh

Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do

Why every Indian wanna be the chief?
Feed a man 'til he full and he still want beef
Give me grief, try to tief off my piece
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars
Get yours in this capitalistic system
So many caught or got bought you can't list them
How you gon' idolize the missing?
To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition
Even when they coming, gunning I stand position
L's known the mission since conception
Let's free the people from deception
If you looking for the answers then you gotta ask the questions
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto
Why black people always be the ones to settle?
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh
Like Cain and Abel, Caesar and Brutus
Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this

Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them father, for
They know not what they do

It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Forgive them, forgive them)
Forgive them father for they know not what they do
(Forgive them, forgive them)

Gwan like dem love you, while dem rip you to shreds
Trample pon yuh heart, and leff you fi dead
Dem a yuh friend, who you depend pon, from way back when
(  to grace)
But if you, gi' dem yuh back, then you must meet yuh end
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Who's gonna be the one?)
Dem nuh know what dem do do
(Gotta be the one to say)
Dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know, dem nuh know
Dem nuh know what dem do do

Final Hour,The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"Uhh, uhh
And yo, uhh, uhh, yo, yo

Yo, I treat this like my thesis
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces
I introduce then produce, words 
so profuse
It's abuse how I juice up this beat, like I'm deuce
Two people both equal like I'm Gemini
, rather Simeon
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it, you can't stop it
Drop it,
 
your whole crew's microscopic
Like particles
 while I make international articles, and on the cover
Don't discuss the baby mother
Business, 
I been in this third LP you can't tell me, I witness
First handed I'm candid
You can't stand it, respect demanded
And get flown around the planet
Rock Hard like granite or steel
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad

You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
I wrote this opus, to reverse the hypnosis
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be the tenant give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival
 
documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron
Things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true
You can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
Cause with all that’s going on I got the world in my palm

You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

Now I be breaking bread sipping 
Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'm a get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip

You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money
You can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money
You can get the power

I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right

But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by

(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

See, I thought this feeling
It was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)
Gave up my power
I existed for you
But who-ever knew
The voo-doo you'd do

It's like people think they love somebody
When they don't really love somebody

Ok. Alright
You think that TV and music have somethin' to do with
Why people are always confused about love?

I get out, you can't hold me in these chains
I'll get out, Father free me from this bondage
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

Your stinking resolution is no type of solution
Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution
I won't support your lie no more
I won't even try no more
If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live
I won't be compromised no more
I can't be victimized no more
I just don't sympathize no more, ‘cause now I understand
You just wanna use me
You say ""love"" then abuse me
You never thought you'd lose me
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'
Your guilt trip's just not workin',
 repressin' me to death
‘Cause now I'm choosin' life, yo
I'll take the sacrifice, yo
If everything must go, then go: that's how I choose to live

Heh… hehehehehe…
Ok, we gettin' there
At least I had a chunk
Aight, okay, it's how I choose to live
Hehehe, awww

No more compromises
I see past your disguises
Blinding me through mind control
Stealing my eternal soul
Appealing through material
To keep me as your slave

I get out, oh, I want out of social bondage
Knowin' my condition, oh, is the reason I must change

See, what you see is what you get
Oh, and you ain't seen nothin' yet
Oh, I don't care if you're upset
I could care less if you're upset
See, it don't change the truth
And your hurt feeling's no excuse
To keep me in this box, psychological locks
Repressin' true expression
Cementin' this repression
Promotin' mass deception
So that no one can be healed
I don't respect your system
I won't protect your system
When you talk I don't listen
Oh, let my Father's will be done

And just get out, oh, just get out of all these bondage
Just get out, oh, you can't hold me in these chains
Just get out, all these traditions killin' freedom
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must change

I've just accepted what you said
Keeping me among the dead
The only way to know is to walk to learn and grow
But faith is not your speed
Oh, you’d have everyone believe
That you're the sole authority
Just follow the majority
Afraid to face reality—the system is a joke
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul
Oh, and escape this mind control
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead
Oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?
Are you sure it's God you serving?
Obligated to a system
Getting less then you're deserving
Who made up these schools, I say
Who made up these rules, I say
Animal conditioning, oh, just to keep us as a slave

Oh, just get out of this social purgatory
Just get out, all these traditions are a lie
Just get out, superstition killin' freedom

On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity
And no concept of reality?

That lives above the spiritual laws?
And does anything they feel just because
There's always someone there who'll applaud?

Or I quitted, now I spit it -- however do you want it?

Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames slightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!) And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious, I'm takin over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!
They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it

C'mon baby light my fire

How come we ain't gettin no higher?

Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone

It was the...Ah
I tried to explain
Ah...but baby, it's in vain
Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)

Time to get free, or give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time

Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Apallin', callin' religious
Some program on television
How can, dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion

Or confidence in the tale

Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail

Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand

It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, I'mma be who I am
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they guilty, yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides
Get free, be who you're supposed to be
Freedom, said it's freedom time now
Freedom, said it's freedom time
Freedom, freedom time now",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-war-in-the-mind-freedom-time-lyrics

Dissatisfaction from bowels to core

Human mythologies, urban folklore
Sick of psychology, counterfeit cure
Wicked theology, robbing the poor
Scheme demonology mislead the pure
Strictly strategically studying war
Light shown in darkness, image exposed
Few can see through the new emperor's clothes
Lustful this hustle turn humans to hoes
When the blind lead the blind, just more trouble and woes
It's the mind that they chose
Its designed to stay closed
Standard of jokers, court jester logic
Sick looking cosmics, from schoolyards to college
Primitive man with civilized knowledge
System collapse and he still won't acknowledge
God is the saviour, studies behavior
Trying to fix the mix mind that he gave ya
Stiff-necked scholars on prescription meds
Wishing their problems were all in their heads

Misguided from youth, heart divided from truth

Imperially led, by the gods in their heads

And cultivate minds for more mythical tales
Typical Hollywood follies good girl
While vice and corruption take over the world

"Every Ghetto, Every City",The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,1998.0,"I was just a little girl
Skinny legs, a press and curl
My mother always thought I'd be a star
But way before the record deals
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

Story starts in Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
""Kill the Guy"" in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in the New Jerusalem

You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back.. looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot
Don't forget, what you got
Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back

Bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel (well that's a quarter)
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu (wuh-TAH!)
Main street roots tonic with the dreds
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lee's to the tongue of my shoes
'Member, FreLng-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick was together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever

Moving Records was on Central Ave
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing my friends' names on my jeans with a marker
July 4th races outside Parker
Fireworks at Martin Stadium
The Untouchable P.S.P
Where all them crazy nig-gaz be
And car thieves got away through Irvington
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self Destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim (children playing, women producing)
Sensations and eighty-eight
Attracted kids from out of state
And everybody used to do the wop (wop it out, wop it out, wop it out)
Jack ya jack ya jack ya body
Nah, the BizMark used to amp up the party

Can't you tell, the way they have to mention
How they helped you out?
You're such a hopeless victim!
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional

All their talk is seasoned to perfection
The road they walk, commanding your affection
They need to be needed,
 
deceived by motivation
An opportunity to further situation
Why they're so important is without explanation
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional

We give rise to ego by being insecure
The advice that we go desperately searching for
The subconscious effort to support our paramour
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional

Stuck in a system that seeks to suck your blood
Held emotionally hostage by what everybody does
Counting all the money that you give them just because
Exploiting ignorance in the name of love
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional
Oh one-dimensional, Mr. Intentional
Oh don't you do me any favors

Wake up, you've been sleeping
Take up your bed and walk
Stop blaming other people
Oh it's nobody else's fault
Accept the truth about you
You know that life goes on without you
And your expensive misinventions
Disguising your intentions
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional

See, I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional
The only help I need to live is unprofessional
The only wealth I have to give is not material
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available

Black Rage,UnKnown,2012.0,"BLACK RAGE is founded on two-thirds a person
Rapings and beatings and suffering that worsens,
Black human packages tied up in strings.
BLACK RAGE can come from all these kinds of things
Black Rage is founded on blatant denial
Squeezing economics, subsistence survival,
Deafening silence and social control.
Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul!
When the dogs bite
When the beatings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
and then I don't fear so bad!
Black rage is founded: who fed us self-hatred
Lies and abuse, while we waited and waited
Spiritual treason, This grid and its cages
Black rage was founded on these kinds of things
Black rage is founded on draining and draining
Threatening your freedom, To stop your complaining
Poisoning your water, While they say it's raining
Then call you mad for complaining, complaining
Old time bureaucracy drugging the youth
Black rage is founded on blocking the truth,
Murder and crime, Compromise and distortion
Sacrifice, sacrifice who makes this fortune?
Greed, falsely called progress
Such human contortion,
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things
So when the dog bites
And the beatings
When I’m feeling sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don’t fear so bad
Free enterprise, is it myth or illusion?
Forcing you back into purposed confusion
Black human trafficking or blood transfusion?
Black rage is founded on these kinds of things.
Victims of violence both psyche and body
Life out of context IS living unGodly
Politics, politics
Greed falsely called wealth
Black rage is founded on denial of self!
Black human packages tied and subsistence
Having to justify your very existence
Try if you must, but you can’t have my soul
Black rage is made by unGodly control
So when the dog bites
And when the beatings
And I’m feeling so sad
I simply remember all these kinds of things
And then I don’t fear so bad",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-black-rage-annotated

Pulls the fascination in my sleeve
Cooling off the fire of my longing
Boiling off my cold within his heat

Evaporating all of my fears
Baptizing me into complete submission

He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing
Floating through the space of my design
Drowning me to find my inside sailing
Drinking in the mainstream of mind
Filling up the cup of my emotions
Spilling over into all I do
If I only I could get lost in his ocean
Surviving on the thought of loving you

He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water, the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Bathing in the fountain of his essence
He causes my expression to remain
Humbled on a mountain by his presence
Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction
In my imagination? No no!
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours
Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land

He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years
He's just like the water
I ain't felt this way in years

Oh Jerusalem,MTV Unplugged 2.0,2002.0,"Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem

Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
Cause everybody else is just as empty
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me

Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?
Freeing me from dust, and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead

Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
Cause I can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity
Oh wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?

Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending, that I'm actually defending
God through my facade, don't need material

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him, and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore

We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss
Why still do evil, we don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh to suggest, that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that lives in me
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit
Without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you
But in vain they call my name
Teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel

Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?

Cry, cry, and then at last, the sun goes down
And leads into your sea
And I can feel your desperate hands all over me, all over me
I dream of you, when I know I shouldn't, shouldn't
You are hurting me and you said that you wouldn't
You promised me you wouldn't you wouldn't
I said I'd be with you and I know I couldn't
And I knew I couldn't
Oh, I, oh I. Indeed, indeed, indeed

So moves like that
This is how we bust rhymes on a phat track
Me and Kahlee, female refugees, we get down like that
I don't know what to sing so my artistry brings
Things from off the top of my head
I bust freestyles instead
Of memories of the time when we were free",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-love-lyrics
Selah,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood Soundtrack,UnKnown,"Nothing can be done against the truth
No matter how we remain in denial, yeah
Wasting time, replacing time with each empty excuse
But that'll only work a little while
Coping with despair, knowing you're not there
Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool
So I blame it on the sun, run away from everyone
Hoping to escape this ridicule
Trapped in misery, wrapped so miserably
And this deception, I wear it like a skin
Dying to maintain, oh I keep trying to explain
A heart that never loved me to begin
Oh I'm such a mess, I have no choice but to confess
That I've been desperately trying to belong
Lieing to myself and everybody else
Refusing to admit my right was wrong

And then He came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then He came
Selah, oh and it means
Did you think about that, and then He came
Selah, oh and it means
Praise and meditation, and then He came
Selah, oh and it means
That it is seen
How beautiful is fruit still in denial of its roots
My guilty heart behaves so foolishly
This treason from within that reasons with my sin
Won't be happy till it sees the death of me
Selfishly addicted to a life that I depicted
Conflicted cause it's not reality
Oh what's left of me, I beg you desperately
Cause me to agree with what I know is best for me
Please save me from myself, I need you, save me from myself
Please save me from myself so I can heal
The choices that I've made, oh have been nothing but mistakes
What a wasted use of space, should I die before I wake
In all of my religion, I've fortified this prison
Obligated to obey the demands of bad decisions
Please save me from myself, I need you
Save me from myself, please save me from myself so I can heal

And then He came
And then He came, then He came, then He came
And then He
And then He came",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-selah-lyrics
I’ve Got Life,Nina Revisited: A Tribute to Nina Simone,2015,"I ain't got no home, ain't got no shoes
Ain't got no money, ain't got no class
Ain't got no friends, ain't got no schooling
Ain't got no hurt, ain't got no job
Ain't got no money, no place to stay
Ain't got no

Programmed inequity, it's in the nervous system
Listen, watch the words, how they twist 'em
Two thirds of the world turned victim
Subtle energy, they capture and block chi
The unseen violence behind the democracy
Some call it hypocrisy, turn freeman into property
And logically justify not treatin' 'em properly
Invisible ink in the constitution
Meant to preserve the institution, unequal distribution
Of wealth, goods and services
Revolvin' door, no floor, just anxiety and nervousness
Trapped in circuses
Herds of us, not understandin' our purposes
When appetites and psychological types
Get caught in the hype, it's tight from morning 'til night
I'm demanding my rights
Women's suffrage
 then black suffrage
Or Jim Crow, the KKK
American terrorism
Murders and beatings on television
It's in the cells now, you thought that was yesterday?
But the compression stays, trauma still got most afraid
Stuck in the memory, fear gives birth to lethargy
Generations of children in jeopardy
History written in jealousy, scribes full of heresy
Full of barbarians, 
ch-ch-check out my melody
Musical therapy, reprogram
Africa full of coltan
Coltrane was a cold man
Black genius in a cold land tryna be the whole man
Heal the homeland
Past time for our own land
Where a grown man can be a grown man
The system has benefit for robbery is robbery
You can't run from it, God is a natural monopoly
Divine creator stuck in monotony
Bureaucracy, psyche on poverty
Self-esteem broken like pottery
No more, not me, codename anomaly
Cause there's just no match for the prodigy
Sovereignty, the god in me
Walking university, living cosmology
Without apology

I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

OK
The more you suppress life the stronger it gets
With death life the longer it gets
I know it’s hard to admit
That you follow some bullshit
Swallow the wrong pill looking for mr bill
Repression, oppression: same thing (same thing)
Fear the shadow that’s the main thing (main thing)
They keep running from
Every action yields an equal and opposite one
Yes that means the consequence comes
Fields of cumbersome back breaking labor
Can’t be healed with just a cummerbund
I was homecoming queen call me number one
Yep that’s another one, now give the drummer some
Tell every mother’s son expression can be far more powerful than a hundred guns
See my Kalashnikov lyrics with the safety off
Now dance around these niggas like Baryshnikov
Street sweeper my words are my keeper
It’s in the ether, now what you trynna tell these preachers, It’s done
It’s done let loose your tongue
Gifted, black and young
Watch these devils run
They knew a change was gonna come
Sinner man  looking for a place to run
Tell the truth in tongues’ enemy reduced by one's
Thousands 2 can put 10,000 in flight
Speak truth to power every 24 hours

I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

(Ay let me tell you)
Imperialism is a form of Jihad
They killed and enslaved millions for gold bullion, in the name of God
The children of mammon called it spiritual famine
Can we examine, how they stole bauxite, rubber, labor, diamonds and platinum?
The building blocks of society and economy, broke humanity to build the colonies
Using reverse psychology to keep us from knowing our quality
No more human tragedy, no more mis-recognition, no more addiction
Let’s accurately diagnose our condition!
Listen:
400 years of the abuse and misuse of religion
Don’t give me another person’s prescription!
I need what I need, my deeds are my deeds
As a man thinketh so is he, 
Mezanmi!
Take the land back, every child, woman and man back
Reevaluate history, expeditiously
Can’t live my life in apostasy
Emulate the apostrophe hang with S, you can rock with me
I come in love and truth (truth)
Look at what I went through
Now it’s time to acknowledge just what I give you: Life

I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you

There’s a whole lotta wrong to be righted, I get excited
I'ma kick this shit off like I’m on Manchester United & 
my attention is undivided, so you can’t divide and conquer me!
I’m sitting comfortably in a SUV, up in my SUV taking artistic liberties
Making musical history, a lil' acupuncture, structural integration, my meditation, liberating a generation & beyond that, 
I’m taking the bomb back. I’m splitting atoms for freedom
, America needs more FREED men, able to talk right, not prone to GREED men (It’s just not what you need man)
Let your words and deeds line up, master the mind, young king man??, put your signs up, intelligent designs up!, plant your seeds, keep your dimes up, cuz no man knows when the time’s up
It’s elemental like Solomon in the temple, Ark of the Covenant, accountable to a higher government
I’m looking for love (in all the wrong places)
Somebody tell me, where them brothas went, reclaim your wealth, no more giving the enemy help, no more sympathy for the devil, let'em hang himself
Get all the billion Black people out of these bottles, suffer while grown people get coddled, you know the novel

I've got life
I've got laughs
I've got headaches and toothaches
And bad times too like you, you, you",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-ive-got-life-lyrics
Interlude 5,MTV Unplugged 2.0,2001.0,"You all doin’ alright?...You okay?
*claps*
I’m not screamin at ya, I’m just askin you a question. Y’all givin’ me a clap.
A yes is fine (laughing) okay?
(voice from audience “I love that song”)
Thank you. Praise God.
I tell you, I know everybody’s in the same mess. I’m telling you.
We all are.
I, I, I know that, you know...
and I’m just, you know, I’ll be the first to tell you, you know,
I’m a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I’m trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You’re the problem, okay, I’m going to show you how you’re causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that’s what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind.
It’s like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that’s deception, you know.
The real gospel is Repent, which means ‘let go of all that crap,’ that’s killin’ you.
Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know.
And when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust.
It wasn’t about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can’t do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you’re supporting and carryin’ and you know, it’s not good. You know, everybody…
a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it’s own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is.
See , that’s what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion.
You know, it’s not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can’t wait to see the game, you know. It’s doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know.
That’s how we’re thankful. That’s how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive.
And I’m just glad that I, you know, I don’t have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate?
And so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn’t reality. It wasn’t the standard at all, you know. T
here’s a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says ‘We compare ourselves amongst ourselves’ you know. That’s not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we’re trying to fit into a standard? It doesn’t make any sense, you know.
So now I’m just, you know, after all that, I’m just ready to be me. And it’s a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it’s because we didn’t understand, you know, because there’s all this social doctrine that says, you know, that
The infinite God, with all this expression,
who created every single one of us,
absolutely different,
On purpose,
wants everybody to fit into the same suit.
But like, you know, that’s deception.
That’s deception.
(Talking to someone offstage) Okay, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don’t think this is the right one.
We took…we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean.
And I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion.
And it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was.
It’s like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin’ their ‘mm’ workin all hard to make it look easy. What’s the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh…(audience laughs).
You know, it’s like, you know what I’m sayin?
I mean, you know.
Slaving.
Slaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do.
None of us do.
And reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let’s stop frontin’. And I’m saying, you know, that’s the blessing.
Now we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?!
And be free.
And we want to defend the curse. I’ll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time...
Too long.
(offstage) You didn’t find it? It’s another white one. But you see…in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it’s reality, okay (laughing)?
One time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely.
You know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me,
he said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else.
I just want you to know that.
Because we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin’ the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is..it’s like I’ve always told to my husband, it’s like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Okay, let’s just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I’m saying?
You can’t get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out.
You know, and the way we’ve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I’m telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we’ve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.
Boy I’ll tell ya, God made him for me. I’m something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I’ll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y’all could clap cuz that’s some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I’m sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he’s like, Alright. So he’s trying to do this but then I’m like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I’m like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Okay, I was like…I’m just not there anymore. Nah, I’m telling you. It’s like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he’s learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he’s like, Okay…I’m out. It’s real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know.
It’s like, we date people, like let’s say, you know, we’re interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I’m sayin? It’s like…And that’s why so many marriages end up in divorce. It’s because people wake up next to a stranger.
They say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed?
Where’s that man that used to do ‘du, dua, and du.’
And I’m sayin let’s give them reality from the door because: you’re going to attract love,
and the one that really loves you. And then you don’t have to pretend and falsify, and you know, keep that posture.
You know, you know, I can’t, I’m just like...I’ll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it’s not even that, you know. It’s but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that’s it, man, I mean, I’m just telling you, it’s so wonderful to finally find…
And trust me, it’s a work in progress, it’s not something that happens overnight.
We all have to be introduced to each other.
I’m telling you, I know that I’m up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill.
But this is the first time y’all meet me. You see what I’m saying? Don’t think you met me before, okay. And as I grow, you’re going to meet me a little bit more. You’re gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y’all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I’m just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that’s not growin' is dead, so we better be changing.
You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they’d say, Uh, she’s changing. The money’s changing her. And I’d say Listen, the money’s not changing me, God’s changing me. I’m changing, because that’s a natural part of life. We’re all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man.
And, um..there’s gonna be warfare involved. Because there’s some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don’t like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I’m a whole person. You can’t say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I’m a whole person. You know. And that’s everybody.
You always talk about spiritual warfare and we didn’t realize that it was in relationships. It’s emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn’t fit into our box for you, we say, well, I ain’t in no box. Don’t try to put me in one.
I’m going to play a little bit of guitar with this one, but I might stop it’s cuz I really want you to listen to the words, so if I stop, you understand why. I want you to really hear the words…",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-interlude-5-annotated

Washing my intentions with his name
Sealing all the floodgates of his passion
Saving all his liquid for his own
Moisturizing me to satisfaction

Drawing out my nature with his hands
Yearning, I'm so thirsty for his power
Burning to be worthy of his land

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you and him then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably ... again
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who're you going to tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock, when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending him
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament

It's silly when girls sell their souls because of sin

Fake nails done by Koreans, come again
Yo! A-when when come again (yeah yeah)
When when come again (yeah yeah)
My friend come again (yeah yeah)

Some girls, some girls are only, about

More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men
Need to take care of their three and four kids
But they face a court case when the child support's late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men

How you gonna win, when you ain't right within?

You got nice jeans
You wear fancy Adidas
I mean it might be something I don't know
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody
Well you tell me, what's the difference
What's the difference?
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody
You looking at it like this
You taking that person for what he or she is
Not matter what he or she look like
And no matter what he or she do
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love
You might stop being in love with that person, but you can't stop loving that person
Sometimes they never been loved before, they never been in love before
They don't know the feeling to be loved
She poetic
She killed you
We get in that conversation with that right?",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-doo-wop-that-thing-gordons-dub-lyrics
Social Drugs,UnKnown,2004.0,"These social drugs 
(Verse 1)
Afraid to address the reality before me
To proud to confess that I'm addicted to a lie
So I seek temporary feeling
To replace reality
Though the truth is telling me I have died
But I've been taught to numb it
Sedated, don't confront it
I hate it when I find out
That I can't get what I wanted
This emotional tantrum
Has become sort of an anthem playing every time I need to take a little trip
To hide this condemnation
I'll find a combination
Of man-made stimulation
To deny my situation
Now this unreality
Is distorting what I see
Reporting back to me
A sense of false security
So in my imagination
I must find a recreation
Desperately in search of ways
To alter my sensation
There's no equilibrium
Inebriated till I'm numb
Intoxicated until I'm dumb
To avoid confrontation
These social drugs
Messing with my mind
These social drugs
Telling me I'm fine
(Verse 2)
Now this chemical analogy
Is our emotional reality
These political, traditional
And ethnical stimulants
And social etiquette
Won't let us be too upset
With the way things really are
You're told to camouflage regret
In a religious structure
Tells us God wants us to suffer
To support a situation we all know is obligation
And if you shun the complication
They'll just gun your reputation
Like mob intimidation
To enforce participation
See they need to keep us fiends
To their lies and broken schemes
And if you find another means
You're told you're being too extreme
And if you wanted to get clean
They'll just pull those social strings
Holding up their social nose
Defying noble things
Now we're all stuck in tradition
Unable to state opposition
Too afraid to contradict
The expectations of the system
Oh and the harsh reality
Is they made grace for you and me
Instead of saving you and me
They're just enslaving you and me
These social drugs
These social drugs
These social drugs
These social drugs
Know what I mean
Know what I mean
These social drugs
These social drugs 
Know what I mean
These social drugs
Messing with my mind
These
Telling me I'm fine
These
Messing with my head
These social drugs
Wanting me dead

Interlude 3,MTV Unplugged 2.0,2002.0,"I tell you, there are no big shots in reality, y'all
We're all in the same boat, dealing with the same issues, same problems, same stuff. Don't even buy it. All the perpetration... you know, all this... ""We don't have problems."" That's a lie. That's a lie. I know that the enemy is doing the same thing to me that he's doing to everybody else. I just know now that the only way to get out is through confrontation. See, we always thought it was retreat, you know, run away. And I'm telling you, you got to confront it
This is a strange song because this song -- when this song was written, this is when everything sort of stopped. It was written a long time ago, but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything. And because I didn't understand... 
Initially it was written -- I'd written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation, when it first happened.
 And I went to the studio, and I laid it down. And it was like, strong, for the first day. And then it just regressed everyday after that. And I said, ""What's going on? What's happening?""
And at the end of it there was a word that i used, ""rebel."" And I guess was afraid. It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I
Put the record out, people would misunderstand what I meant by ""rebel"" and they'd just take it to the streets. So I was very intimidated and afraid. And before I knew it a whole host of things happened. Everything stopped after that. And the creativity stopped. Everything stopped. That's when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about. And I had to be, you know, a living example
It's real crazy because I don't know what the press is saying because I don't listen to the press too much. But I know the view is that I'm emotionally unstable, which is reality. Like you aren't?
I'm laughing because what I've realized I've become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first, you see, to make sure that they work. And that's when you know, OK look, I got something that works. You know what I'm saying? I'm not gonna give you something that I haven't tested for myself. And you go through, and you're learning by way of experience, and you're making mistakes, and you're getting up
A friend of mine once said to me, he said, Look, if we weren't supposed to turn around, why does a car have a steering wheel?
 Are we just supposed to crash into the wall? No, we're supposed to say, Listen, I was going the wrong way... Reverse!
In this particular song, now I realize that this song is about freedom. You see? We could look at one human being, but it's about the spirit of freedom being taken out, and how it's taken out in all of us

When you look into my eyes
You saw right through me
And I could not hide
I was exposed

You hold it in your hands
I'm yours to command
I'm yours to demand
I, I feel so humble
With you in my life
With you in my life

I remember
When I looked into your eyes
I saw a reflection of myself
And I could not lie
Out of control
Too weak to deny
All of myself
Is naked before you
But what can I do
There is nothing I can do
I feel so beautiful

Open Tumblr Letter on Racism,UnKnown,UnKnown,"The concept of reverse racism is flawed, if not absolutely ridiculous. Most, if not all of the negative responses from people of color toward white people, are reactions to the hatred, violence, cruelty and brutality that they were shown by white people for centuries. Much of the foundation of the modern world was built on the forced free labor of black peoples. The African Slave Trade, the institution of slavery, colonialism, its derivative systems, and the multiple holocausts throughout history, where whites used race as the defining reason to justify their oppression, conquest, and brutal treatment of non-white peoples, are how race became such a factor to begin with.
The initial claim by the oppressors, followed a moral imperative (so they said) that people outside of Occidental and European birth were in savage and cursed conditions, and that God justified the captivity of these people, and the rape and pillage of their lands.
Ironically, these oppressors would try to discard this same God, who supposedly justified this brutality, in the name of Darwin, whose famous line ‘survival of the fittest’ was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention.
Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism, and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable.
In order to justify reverse racism one would have to first create an even playing field, undo the generations of torture, terror, and brutality, and then judge whether or not a non-white person is in fact a racist. This approach would require people to examine the need/addiction to feel superior to someone else for no justifiable reason, and the myriad policies: Spiritual, political and social, that it bore. True dominion is self evident and not the result of sabotaging another in order to achieve it. That would be an illegitimate as well as a fleeting position. The Universe, will eventually seek to right/balance itself.
Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives, not exploiting ill-gotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others. Humanity in proper order is obligated to acknowledge the Truth, whoever it comes from, be they Black, White or other. Righteous indignation is simply a response to long-standing evil.
Much of the world is still reeling from the abuses of Imperialist selfishness, misunderstanding, ignorance and greed. Black people remain in many ways a shattered community, disenfranchised, forcefully removed from context and still caged in, denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom. Their natural homes, just like their natural selves, raped and pillaged of the resources and gifts God has given to them. Interpreted through someone else’s slanted lens and filter, they remain in many ways, misrepresented. Taxation without proper representation, might I remind you, was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War, which gained this country its independence from England. Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power, but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses, or deep, meaningful and profound change.
If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this country’s history, and add it all up, it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism, violent domination, theft, rape, abuse, captivity, and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy, racism, and slave based paradigms. I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse. How then does the chief offender become the judge? Might does not necessarily mean right. Right is right. People forcibly reduced to sub-human existences, so that they behave in sub-human ways, helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity. People, like plants, grow where the light is. When you enclose a plant and limit its light source, it will bend itself toward the light, for the light is necessary for its survival. This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them, survival then forces them to twist and/or bend toward the only way of escape.
There is good. And I both acknowledge and encourage the good. Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water, we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands. America’s particular brand of hypocrisy is gross (double entendre).
I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term ‘make the IRS whole’… make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities. The entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?! Who has made recompense for stealing, imposing, lying, murdering, criminalizing the traumatized, taking them against their wills, destroying their homes, dividing their communities, ‘trying’ to steal their destinies, their time, stagnating their development, I could go on and on. Has America, or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities, ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them, control them, manipulate them, cage them, rob them, brutalize them, subject them to rules that don’t apply to all? Use language, veiled coercion, and psychological torment like invisible fences to keep them locked into a pattern of limitation and therefore control by others. You have to remain focused to cease from rage.
The prosecutor, who was a woman, made a statement during sentencing about me not doing any charity work for a number of years during my ‘exile.’ A) Charity work is not a requirement, but something done because someone wants to. I was clearly doing charitable works way before other people were even thinking about it. And B) Even the judge had to comment that she, meaning I, was both having and raising children during this period. As if that was not challenging enough to do. She sounded like the echo of the grotesque slave master, who expected women to give birth while in the field, scoop the Baby up, and then continue to work. Disgusting.
When you are beaten and penalized for being independent, or truly self reliant, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with self-reliance, and a fear of true independence. When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education. When families are broken up by force and threat of violence, then the family structure becomes dysfunctional. When men who would naturally defend their women and families are threatened with castration and death, then this natural response also becomes dysfunctional. When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence, then examination of him and his system becomes a difficult and taboo thing to do, despite every bone in your body demanding it. When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death, imprisonment, or economic assassination, then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept. Anyone forced to live so incredibly diametrically opposed to that which is natural to themselves, will end up in crisis if they don’t successfully find a way to improve or transcend these circumstances! All of which require healing. It is only by the Grace of God and the resilience of the people that things haven’t been worse.
Much of my music, if not all of it, is about Love, a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency. Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone. It is a sacrificial work that doesn’t simply happen between the hours of 9 to 5 or Monday through Friday, but when inspiration leads us to avail ourselves for the Truth that needs to be said. Unlike the system too often contrarily demonstrates, we believe that people can be and should be helped, and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged, healed and dealt with. This takes awareness, sensitivity and a level of freedom in my opinion the system lacks. And if we don’t know or understand how to do it, then we humbly refer to a higher authority.
We have no desire to create humanoids, turn people into machines, or dumb them down so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve. Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares, traps, and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping and/or uninformed.
Why would a system, ‘well intentioned’, wait until breakdown or incarceration to consider rehabilitation, after generations of institutionally inflicted trauma and abuse on a people? To me it is obvious that the accumulation of generational trauma and abuse have created the very behaviors the system tries to punish, by providing no sufficient outlets for the victims of institutional terror. Clearly, the institution seeks to hide its own criminal history at the expense and wholeness of the abused, who ‘acting out’ from years of abuse and mistreatment, reflect the very aggression that they were exposed to.",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-open-tumblr-letter-on-racism-annotated

Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me
No!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better

Couldn't tell me I was loved when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love
Shoulda told me just because
I'm worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's something awesome about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you
True love can never really forsake you

And I couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head

So I could come back and love you whole instead

So I could love you better

Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you

Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot tears, I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind

I had to lose myself so I could make it better

Had to lose myself, had to lose myself

I had created this, uh, public persona, this public illusion.
And it became, it, uh, it held me hostage; like I couldn't be a real person because you're too afraid of, you know, what your, your public will say.
And at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, ""this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies.""
You know, and so it's been, um... it's been... it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.
I know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.
But um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.

Conforming our vision

Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the higest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water

Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than

Totally paranoid
Enjoyed darkness as lord
Keeping me from the sword
Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat, we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumcision

Only water can purge the hearts from words

Tumblr Post,UnKnown,UnKnown,"It has been reported that I signed a new record deal, and that I did this to pay taxes. Yes, I have recently entered into an agreement with Sony Worldwide Entertainment, to launch a new label, on which my new music will be released. And yes, I am working on new music.
I’ve remained silent, after an extensive healing process. This has been a 10+ year battle, for a long time played out behind closed doors, but now in front of the public eye. This is an old conflict between art and commerce… free minds, and minds that are perhaps overly tethered to structure. This is about inequity, and the resulting disenfranchisement caused by it. I’ve been fighting for existential and economic freedom, which means the freedom to create and live without someone threatening, controlling, and/or manipulating the art and the artist, by tying the purse strings.
It took years for me to get out of the ‘parasitic’ dynamic of my youth, and into a deal that better reflects my true contribution as an artist, and (purportedly) gives me the control necessary to create a paradigm suitable for my needs. I have been working towards this for a long time, not just because of my current legal situation, but because I am an artist, I love to create, and I need the proper platform to do so.
The nature of my new business venture, as well as the dollar amount reported, was inaccurate, only a portion of the overall deal. Keep in mind, my past recordings have sold over 50,000,000 units worldwide, earning the label a tremendous amount of money (a fraction of which actually came to me).
Only a completely complicated set of traps, manipulations, and inequitable business arrangements could put someone who has accomplished the things that I have, financially in need of anything. I am one artist who finds value in openly discussing the dynamics within this industry that force artists to compromise or distort themselves and what they do, rather than allowing them to make the music that people need. There are volumes that could (and will) be said.

Doo Wop (That Thing) (Album Version),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Yo, remember back on the boule when cats used to harmonize like
Yo, my men and my women
Don't forget about the deen, the Sirat al-Mustaqeem
Yo, it's about a thing
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend
The one you let hit it and never called you again
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?
You act like you ain't hear him, then give him a little trim
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?
Showing off your ass cause you're thinking it's a trend
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again
You know I only say it cause I'm truly genuine
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em
Now, Lauryn is only human
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans
Fake nails done by Koreans
Come again (x3)

Guys you know you'd better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing

The second verse is dedicated to the men
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (Like you got yen)
Let's not pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men
Need to take care of they three or four kids
And they face a court case when the child support late
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men
The sneaky, silent men
The punk, domestic violence men
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men
How you gonna win when you ain't right within? (x3)
Come again (x3)

Watch out, watch out
Look out, look out

Girls you know you’d better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Guys you know you’d better watch out
Some girls, some girls are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing
That thing, that thing, that thing
Girls you know you’d better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about

Nothing Even Matters (Feat D’Angelo),UnKnown,UnKnown,"Now the skies could fall
Not even if my boss should call
The world it seems so very small
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters

See I don't need no alcohol
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall
Without it I'd go through withdrawal
'Cause nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters at all
These buildings could drift out to sea
Some natural catastrophe
Still there's no place I'd rather be
'Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
You're part of my identity
I sometimes have the tendency
To look at you religiously
'Cause nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters to me
Now you won't find me at no store
I have no time for manicures
With you it's never either or

Nothing even matters no more
Nothing even matters
Nothing even matters no more

Yo... (Can I see you?) Lauryn Hill on the track...
(In the morning) New Ark got my back...
DJ Skribble, just relax, haha! I'm a get you the joint! haha!
Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh, Uh Huh!

As I span the cosmos
Mahogany travel at the speed of sound
Span the mainstream but still esteemed underground
My parameters, and wrap up contaminants
Travel twice Earth's diameter, intimidating amateurs (what?!)
At the Apollo, I played the shepherd, sheep followed
Chicks try to model after me like I'm Tyra
Banks; wanna thank me 'cause my statements are prodigious
Styles so prestigious, make a sinner act religious
Street academics, seen alot of girls mimic (Huh)
But when it's all over you can tell who's the gimmick
L slang-bangs like a dub plate (Bing!)
Jericho Sound System, mash up your club dates!
Sweeter than a cherry on a fruit cocktail
Whenever, Wherever, Whatever like Maxwell (Unh)
My pentium makes more chips than Intel (Intel)
I didn't mean to turn you on like Cherrelle!
Kids move they body like they're tripping off of acid
Anthony, not even fantasy can surpass it
Once you blast it, one starts to feel kinky
I think he, goes by the name of Young Slinky
And just when you thought it was safe to relax
L-Boogie spits with perfect syntax!
Then, DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax (What?)...
DJ Skribble make you dribble on the wax!
Can I hear you in the morning
Like I hear you late at night?
Chance to hear you, amp the party
DJ Skribble, keep it tight!
Just a short time in the morning
Like I hear you late at night
Chance to hear you, amp the party
DJ Skribble, keep it tight!

I know I sound raspy, but that's, hey, I used to go on tour, you know, and I'd be a prisoner. I used to be a prisoner on tour, cause I would go on tour, and tour you're supposed to enjoy and  have a good time, but I'd be this prisoner in a hotel, you know, drinking tea and, you know, telling the children, you know, ""Mommy has to sleep"" cause I wanted to maintain this, you know, immaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic.
You know, reality is, sometimes I stay up late, and this is what I sound like when I wake up the next day, and you know, it's a voice.
You know, and to me, the more I, uh, I focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message.Cause when I'm, I used to be so, oh my God, if I sound harsh and raspy I can't go out there. And that's a lie, you know, I just sound like a singer with a lot of stuff in her throat.
So...
I told the people at MTV that they got to light me better. If not people are going to keep saying, ""who's that boy on stage, who's that little boy?""

World Is a Hustle,UnKnown,2008.0,"Of the world spun by evil men with lies
Only programmed to agree with what we see before our eyes
Running after status quo on a television show
Just a picture-perfect life is the only life we know
And this uncomfortable reality got me chasing, chasing fallacy
And the pace, the pace is killing me, but I so willingly practiced sin
Just like it's my friend when the whole world is a hustle
Exactly where did we arrive in this manufactured life?
To sell my soul just to survive (yes) in the game of numbers I
I must thank the Gods of Industry, oh, for the opportunity
Or I display such loyalty, oh, for the way that they exploit me (yes)
- Oh, to consider life outside of this
Just like a splinter in my mind persists
But the Ministry of Fear exists
Only to keep me from knowing the truth
Stealing my youth when the whole world is a hustle -
Escape familiarity means that I must face the fear in me
Do something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend
Oh, when will it end? When the whole world is a hustle
To escape this mere analogy means that I must face the fear in me
Do something with this greed in me in order to address this need in me
Oh but I must confess the pride I keep, protect it as if it's my friend
Until the bitter end when the whole of the world is a hustle
Everybody’s got it going on (yeah right, yeah right)
Everybody’s so damn strong (yeah right, yeah right)
When the whole of the world is a hustle, a hustle (x5)

Who will dominate the opinions?
Schisms and isms, keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision to the world church of decision
Trapped in a section, submitted to committing election
Moral affection, epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection, of the highest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders from hearin' it like underwater
Beyond the borders, find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy of a systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity, head first in the cavity without a bottom
A fate, worst then Sodom
What's gotem drunk of the spirit?
Truth comes we can't hear it when you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was falling in indecision
Appalling, calling religious a program on television
How can... Dominate wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of antichrists'? The majority rules
Intelligent fools
P. H. D. 's in illusion, masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of past illusion
Now who you choosing?
The head or the tail?
The bloodshed of the male or confidence in the veil?
Conferences at Yale discussing doctrines of Baal

I want to be pure pure love
So I can restore love
So I can make more love
So I can be sure love
Help me be secure love
So I can make more love
So I can restore love

That is the objective, to be conformed to love, to actually be love incarnate
Because that is what I was before, but ya'll got that I think
To be love incarnate, and to not listen to people who might say there's something wrong with being love, you know. I'll give you an example:
You talked about professionalism
But what does professionalism have to do with a real exchange
You are as professional as you have to be right now
You are as professional as you need to be
Your sincerity has offended me in any way
It hasn't confused or complicated things
If anything it's broken down and made the environment more comfortable for everyone else
What did it do, what was the cost of your lack of professionalsim, your so called lack of professionalism, because I don't call it that
I believe a world can exist on honesty, I just do, you know. I'm a believer",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-conform-to-love-lyrics

Letter Of Recognition-
Firstly, I want to thank everyone who wrote letters and sent packages and books. Because of you there was not one day that I didn't receive mail while I was away. I appreciated that. Also, know that many of your letters not only touched me but continued to confirm for me what I already knew but needed to hear again: that sincere expression has a serious purpose. If one of you had been touched, picked up, encouraged, prevented from succumbing to some measure of social or Spiritual decline, then it was worth it. Folks, walk strong, seek light and Universal correction in all things. Know that man-made concerns and Universal concerns are not always in agreement. Obviously, strive to please God. Thank you again and again.

Wild Is the Wind,Nina Revisited: A Tribute to Nina Simone,2015,"Love me, love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind
Give me more than one caress
Satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
For wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
And you kiss me
And with your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
So wild is the wind
And wild is the wind
You touch me
I hear the sound of mandolins
You kiss me
And with your kiss my life begins
Daddy you're spring to me
All things to me
Don't you know you're life itself
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind

Do You Like The Way,UnKnown,UnKnown,"(feat. Santana & CEE LO)

Watch the master plan, the pastures span
Through the streets, move the sheep
Flipped the beat, like the shepherd
It's a new day, my crew stay forever striving
Give thanks cause we alive, and been through the gutter
Now we see the horizon
It's clear to me now
Used to be confused, took a lot of years to see how
Now, we moving planets
Take the average mind and expand it
You take for granted like we're always gonna be disadvantaged
But soon come, it soon come, ya soon done
Ya start run, you stumble, we catch one
In the rhythm, Santana lick the guits with precision
Not accidental, intentional conscious decision
To Zion, we're marching through with African Mayans
Conquering Babylon with the heart of a lion
And the walls of Jericho come a-tumbling down
Tell me, how long has it been
Is everything, everything alright my friend
You see, time is passing, people asking how come none of this ain't lasting
Money will make people deal like they don't even have to feel
But no, it ain't real, it ain't real
Oh, do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Ooh, do you like the way
How long, how long will we wait, to sit down and communicate
See, everything is relative, if you want to get then give
Can't we all just build and live,can't we, can't we?
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down
Do you like the way that it's going down",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-do-you-like-the-way-lyrics
Ne Me Quitte Pas,Nina Revisited: A Tribute to Nina Simone,2015,"Ne me quitte pas
Il faut oublier
Tout peut s'oublier
Qui s'enfuit deja
Oublier le temps
Des malentendus
Et le temps perdu
A savoir comment
Oublier ces heures
Qui tuaient parfois
A coups de pourquoi
Le coeur du bonheur

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Moi je t'offrirai
Des perles de pluie
Venues de pays
Où il ne pleut pas
Je creuserai la terre
Jusqu'apres ma mort
Pour couvrir ton corps
D'or et de lumière
Je ferai un domaine
Où l'amour sera roi
Où l'amour sera loi
Où tu seras reine

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je t'inventerai
Des mots insensés
Que tu comprendras
Je te parlerai
De ces amants là
Qui ont vu deux fois
Leurs coeurs s'embraser
Je te racont'rai
L'histoire de ce roi
Mort de n'avoir pas
Pu te rencontrer

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

On a vu souvent
Rejaillir le feu
De l'ancien volcan
Qu'on croyait trop vieux
Il est paraît-il
Des terres brûlées
Donnant plus de blé
Qu'un meilleur avril
Et quand vient le soir
Pour qu'un ciel flamboie
Le rouge et le noir
Ne s'épousent-ils pas

Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas
Ne me quitte pas

Ne me quitte pas
Je ne vais plus pleurer
Je ne vais plus parler
Je me cacherai là
À te regarder
Danser et sourire
Et à t'écouter
Chanter et puis rire
Laisse-moi devenir
L'ombre de ton ombre
L'ombre de ta main
L'ombre de ton chien

Nas Interlude,"J. Period Presents... Best of Lauryn Hill, Vol. 1: Fire ",UnKnown,"Yo, what up? This is Nas with the official (-), J. Period
""If I Ruled the World"" was originally a Kurtis Blow record
You know? Somebody who I love and saw him in crèche school
And his song wit' ""These are the breaks""...
I used to breakdance to his music, you hear what I'm sayin'?
So ""If I Ruled the World"" was a tribute to him
And also speakin' out to the world
And, um, I used to work wit' the Fugees on tour
And, you know, they would open up for me wit' our first albums
And our second albums, it flipped
And he sold, like, you know, thirty million albums
And I'm — now I'm openin' up for them
So, um, we was — we was cool like that
And, you know, Lauryn came and got on the record
Who I felt was — would make the record even more incredible
Me and her, I really appreciate her work
And, um, and talked to her well
You know, not just my projects, but every projects in December
Everywhere in the world
So I thought that would be the perfect record

If I ruled the world
Still living for today in these last days and times",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-nas-interlude-lyrics

Your whole operation makes me laugh
No Class
You never had money now your whole Op's about cash
Come on find a new topic
You got kids in the street listening to this SHIT
You going to kill them just to make a profit
You're real short term
You don't see the big picture
Just look at the news
I don't need to quote scripture
At you, but I can do that to
Bad boys what you going to do when the come for you
I don't mean the Coppers (Cops)
I mean the Tormentors

Response to Accusations on “Neurotic Society”,UnKnown,UnKnown,"Neurotic Society is a song about people not being, or not being able to be, who and what they truly are, due to the current social construct. I am not targeting any particular group of people, but rather targeting everyone in our society who hides behind neurotic behavior, rather than deal with it.
The world we live in now is, in many ways, an abhorrent distortion, an accumulation of generations and generations of response to negative stimuli. Many don’t even have a concept of what normal is, by virtue of having lived afraid, ashamed, as victims of abuse, or inadequately handled for so long. I believe in coming up from under that fear and allowing the psyche/soul to truly heal. I understand that healing is a process, but I also believe that it is our responsibility to seriously care for ourselves, so that we can extend that level of concern for others and positively affect our environment.
I want what is best for Humanity. Humanity, aligned with the Spiritual principles, that help each individual conquer fear, and transcend limited circumstance. I believe in healing and dealing with the traumatizing events of our lives, both in this lifetime, as well as those passed down to us, or inherited, so we can live as fully as possible.
The whole world suffers from a lack of honest dialogue. Character and integrity have suffered at the hands of political correctness and corporate agenda, while our society moves further and further towards unhealthiness and breakdown. I oppose these trends.
Everyone has a right to their own beliefs. Although I do not necessarily agree with what everyone says or does, I do believe in everyone’s right to protest.
The overarching message of my music is to get up and stop compromising! And hopefully it will stimulate and motivate the changes that our society needs.
Artists are constantly under media and public scrutiny. This is not a one-way street. Those of us with the charge of putting out faithful vibrations, have a responsibility to report what we see, and to write about what we know. I have seen some of the best and also some of the worst representations of human behavior. The same way that I exalt that which is high, is the same way I expose that which is abusive, in order to motivate and remind if not all of us, than as many as possible, of the Higher Calling.",https://genius.com/Lauryn-hill-response-to-accusations-on-neurotic-society-annotated
